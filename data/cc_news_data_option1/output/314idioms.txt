Often we focus on what went wrong. The goal we didn’t meet. The “diet” that we couldn’t “stick to”. The workout that didn’t happen. While it may be human nature to pay more attention to setbacks, psychologists have found that we might get closer to our goals to be healthier and happier if we learn to better savor positive experiences and celebrate even the smallest successes.
 In their book, _Savoring,_ social psychologists Fred Bryant and Joseph Veroff make a strong case for the health benefits of “being mindfully engaged and aware during positive events.”
 This mindful engagement increases happiness, strengthens relationships, improves mental and physical health, and improves creativity. Bryant and Veroff describe nine strategies to help savor positive experiences: behavioral expression (celebrate), self congratulations, share with others, memory building, temporal awareness (“slow down time”), count your blessings, absorption, sensory-perceptual sharpening (“sharpen your senses”) and comparing.
 Here’s how you can apply these nine strategies to help you (and your whole family) boost mental and physical health–and feel good and have fun while you do it.

Many studies show factors like alcohol consumption and nighttime increase the likelihood of wrong-way collisions, and all six of these deaths involved at least one of those two factors. Caltrans itself says that the primary cause of fatal wrong way collisions remains drivers under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
 It’s not always possible to keep every impaired driver or those who might intentionally drive the wrong way off Highway 1, but reviewing these wrong way accidents reveal some quick, simple fixes already approved by the California Traffic Control Devices Committee (CTCDC) that could save lives in the next 90 days.
 Solutions
 All six of these wrong-way accidents happened on divided sections of Highway 1 where the center median is comprised of a long line of temporary concrete barriers about 2 1/2 tall (Caltrans calls them “K Rails”).
 One simple fix would be to place Caltrans yellow directional arrow signs on both sides of this concrete median every 100 yards for the entire length of the Pacifica divided highway. Drivers would only see these arrows for the side of the highway they were on.
 A complementary solution would place backwards-facing red “Wrong Way” signs toward potential wrong way traffic along the highway 300 yards before every highway off-ramp. Anyone on the highway in the wrong direction would see three “wrong way” signs every time they passed an exit.
 A third quick fix already approved in use elsewhere would be replacing all existing exit ramp “wrong way” signs at the intersection of city streets with blinking LED-borders powered by a solar cell. Some like the Manor exit ramp, have many signs but are poorly lit at night.
 History
 In five of these six deaths, a wrong-way driver was headed south in the northbound lane while in the most recent (details of which have not yet been made public) a driver headed north in the southbound lanes.
 It hasn’t always been clear where most deadly wrong-way drivers entered Highway 1 or even how far they drove the wrong direction before their fatal accidents.
 On Feb. 9, 2019, a motorist drove the wrong way along Highway 1 for 4 miles before the final accident at Sharp Park Drive, but a July 25, 2015, accident just south of Sea Bowl Lane involved an intoxicated wrong-way driver who turned left and drove just 250 yards before striking and killing another driver. A 2015 Caltrans study in San Diego showed 13 fatal wrong-way collisions but 338 total wrong-way drivers. How many other law-abiding motorists in Pacifica escape tragedy when wrong-way drivers exit the highway before ramming them?

Chicago is widely known as the "windy city" but the California city of Palm Springs has been benefiting from its Santa Ana winds since 1982, when the first wind farm was built in the San Gorgonio Pass.      Coming from Los Angeles, travelers will find thousands of turbines -- about 4,000 -- on both sides of Interstate 10. Driving by, the energy producing "windmills" look big, but travelers can't really get a handle on how big until standing next to one. Some of the blades are more than half the size of a football field, standing about 150 feet tall. At the top, the turbines have a generator that weighs in at 30,000 to 45,000 pounds.      The wind farm provides enough energy to power Palm Springs and the entire Coachella Valley. It is quite a sight, and to get an understanding of how it all works, take a wind farm tour. Best of the Best Tours offers tours with knowledgeable guides -- a lot more fun than science class. For information and to purchase tickets visit thebestofthebesttours.com.      Palm Springs is also known for its movie history. Many famous people lived in this valley, including Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Tony Curtis, Sandra Dee, Gene Autry, Cary Grant, Elvis and so many more. It was where they escaped to enjoy privacy and relaxation. Today's stars who can be seen in the area include Leonardo DiCaprio, Suzanne Somers, Barbra Streisand and James Brolin, Robert Downey Jr., Brad Pitt and President Obama and family.      History walking tours are offered through the Palm Springs Historical Society for those interested in the homes of the stars and architecture. Visit pshistoricalsociety.org. Best of the Best Tours also offers a Rich and Famous Tour that includes homes to the stars.      This valley of 48,000-plus residents offers a large variety of entertainment, from theaters, concerts and plays to horseback riding and snowshoeing. Yes, this warm, sunny, palm-tree-lined city offers winter sports. Take a short tram ride up the mountain -- 8,516 feet -- to Mount San Jacinto State Park, where residents and visitors take part in winter sports and camping, hiking and guided nature walks in the summer. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway takes riders high above the valley to the snow-capped mountains. At the top of the mountain, visitors will find Peaks Restaurant. It offers beautiful views of the Coachella Valley and good food. Also at the top is Pines Cafe, a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the Lookout Lounge, offering alcoholic beverages and appetizers.      The tram itself is an experience. It rotates as travelers ascend and descend the mountain to take in all the views of the valley and the mountains. The first tram was completed in 1963, but a project was completed in 2000 that added new cars and renovated the facilities. It is known as the world's largest rotating tramcar system ever constructed. Visit pstramway.com for details on the tram rides, dining and activities.

Later, Juan Guaidó gave a press conference presided by vice-president Charanzová, Eurodeputy Jordi Cañas and members of other groups that support the democratic cause. Guaidó decried the terrorist groups that operate in Venezuela and asked the EU to designate the gold extracted in the Mining Arc as “blood gold,” since it’s used to finance armed groups. Guaidó thinks that such a tag can end the ethnocide and ecocide in a territory that’s over 110,000 km². Guaidó asked the EU to strengthen the sanction process, aid in the refugee crisis and assume that the only way to force Nicolás into a transition is increasing international pressure. He thinks that “with the Contact Group there’s an opportunity for a specific solucion, pressure, and that’s why sanctions are important.”

 It is likely that the bout will be rescheduled in the coming weeks at a venue in the United States. The winner of the fight is expected to face the UK's Josh Taylor later this year in a fight which could potentially unify the WBO, WBC, WBA Super and IBF light welterweight titles.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece's parliament is set to approve a proposal by the country's center-right government to abolish an election system based on proportional representation but is likely to fall short of the cross-party support needed for the changes to take effect before the next general election. The government is seeking the return of a system that rewards the winning party with bonus seats in the 300-member parliament — a system designed to avoid coalitions. To take immediate effect, the bill must be approved with at least 200 votes but the government has only secured the support of 168 lawmakers, so the new system would be implemented only after the next election. The vote in parliament is scheduled to take place later Friday. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy won general elections in July and formed Greece's first one-party government in a decade. He has argued that governments free of coalition commitments are better placed to help Greece recover from its major economic crisis. But left- wing and center-left opposition parties maintain that coalitions are more likely to avoid the corrupt practices, exorbitant public borrowing and spending excesses that were among the lead causes of the financial crisis. Greece ended its third successive international bailout in 2018 after losing market access in 2010.

No one is considering the infrastructure needs in our communities, such as a viable transportation structure, or the water and sewer needs.

 This one-size-fits-all alleged solution to the housing issues is deeply flawed and not the answer. It’s time for the people to say, “enough is enough,” and elect representatives who will find reasonable answers to the affordable housing issues, not just continue building housing units in the name of a cure for the affordable housing crisis.

A report issued this week by an umbrella organization for the world's central banks argued that the answer is yes, while warning that central bankers lack tools to deal with what it says could be one of the biggest economic dislocations of all time.      The book-length report, published by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, signals what could be the overriding theme for central banks in the decade to come.      "Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to human societies, and our community of central banks and supervisors cannot consider itself immune to the risks ahead of us," François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, said in the report.      Central banks spent much of the past 10 years hauling their economies out of a deep financial crisis that began in 2008. They may well spend the next decade coping with the disruptive effects of climate change and technology, the report said.      The European Central Bank, which Thursday concluded a two-day meeting in Frankfurt focusing on monetary policy, is beginning to grapple with those challenges. The bank did not make any changes in interest rates or its economic stimulus program Thursday. Instead, other issues are coming to the fore.      Christine Lagarde, the central bank's president, who took office late last year, has pledged to put climate change on the bank's agenda, and the issue will play an important role as the ECB embarks on the first comprehensive review since 2003 of how it conducts monetary policy.      "While we might not be ahead of the curve yet, we are not sitting on our bottoms doing nothing," Lagarde said during a news conference Thursday, noting that the bank's employee pension fund is shifting investment to companies with lower carbon dioxide emissions. "It is going to be an important matter that will be debated during the strategy review."      The ECB formally began the review Thursday, saying it would be done by the end of the year. The review will focus on how to steer inflation in the eurozone, the bank's main job, while also considering "the threat to environmental sustainability, rapid digitalization, globalization and evolving financial structures."      But there will probably be disagreement within the bank's Governing Council about using all of its financial firepower to help avert a climate catastrophe.      When buying corporate bonds to influence market interest rates, for example, the bank could exclude debt of corporations considered big producers of greenhouse gases. That approach could have a powerful effect on financial markets, encouraging private investors to follow suit by also acquiring bonds of companies considered sustainable and dumping debt issued by polluters.      Lagarde acknowledged that some members of the Governing Council question whether fighting climate change is a central bank's job.      "I'm aware of all that," Lagarde said. "I'm also aware of the danger of doing nothing."      This new attention to the financial consequences of a hotter Earth comes as central banks are contending with another new challenge: technologies that threaten their monopoly on issuing money and their power to combat a financial crisis.      Digital currencies like bitcoin and Libra, Facebook's planned offering, bypass central banks and could undermine their control of the monetary system. One solution is for central banks to get into the digital currency business themselves.      On Wednesday, the central banks of Britain, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland said they were working together with the Bank for International Settlements to figure out what would happen if they did just that.      It's complicated, though.      As with cash, people can use digital currencies to pay other people directly, without a bank in the middle. But unlike cash, digital currencies allow person-to-person transactions to take place online.      Such a system could be more efficient, but also risky, said a report issued Wednesday by the World Economic Forum, the organization that stages the annual conclave in Davos, Switzerland.      Commercial banks might become superfluous and fail, leaving central banks to become, in effect, giant retail banks. But they have no experience dealing with millions of individual customers and could be overwhelmed. If a central bank collapsed, so would the monetary system.      Climate change also takes central banks into uncharted territory. Think the subprime crisis in 2008 was bad? Imagine a real estate crisis caused by rising sea levels and coastal flooding that renders thousands of square miles of land uninhabitable or useless for farming.      By some estimates, global gross domestic product could plunge by nearly one- quarter by the end of the century because of the effects of climate change. Central banks have enough trouble dealing with mild recessions and would not be powerful enough to combat an economic downturn of that scale.      "In the worst case scenario, central banks may have to intervene as climate rescuers of last resort or as some sort of collective insurer for climate damages," said the Bank for International Settlements report.      It suggested some precautionary measures central banks could take.      Central banks, which often function as bank regulators, could require lenders to increase capital reserves if they hold assets vulnerable to the economic effects of a shift to renewable energy. An example might be a bank that has lent a lot of money to fossil fuel companies, or to the Saudi government.      The auto industry already illustrates how investors are moving their money away from companies seen as polluters and into those seen as environmentally friendly, with disruptive effects on economies. Tesla's value on the stock market is more than $100 billion, second only to Toyota among carmakers. (Toyota is still worth more than twice as much as Tesla.)      In this way, Tesla is being rewarded for producing emission-free electric vehicles. But the migration of capital away from the established manufacturers makes it difficult for them to invest in new technology, and it could result in huge job losses as well as social and political upheaval.      Central banks need to coordinate their policies to deal with these new challenges, said the Bank for International Settlements report. Unfortunately, coordination is not something that central banks are very good at right now.      "Climate change is a global problem that demands a global solution," the paper said. But, it added, "monetary policy seems, currently, to be difficult to coordinate between countries."

“I can only write on issues that draw my attention and what I feel about them,” she says, adding it is her hope that her work will inspire others to take up the narrative.
 Nirmala who grew up on a steady diet of good, old-fashioned literature says she loves the English language for its use of ‘loan words’ and admires Shakespeare. “So many of the phrases he coined are still in use even today.” _Taboo_ is peppered with words borrowed from Tamil, Spanish and a smattering of Sinhalese that adds a sense of the lyrical to her work.
 Nirmala who plays the piano and violin admits that she is deeply influenced by music and that her travel experiences become part of the literary landscape in her books. She believes that despite its underlying tone of mystery, _Taboo_ deals with a serious issue that requires one’s undivided attention.
 A self-confessed creative gypsy, Nirmala says there are more books in the pipeline, including a series for children. A portion of the royalties from _Taboo_ will go to the survivors of sex trade at Freedom Firm and Ruhamah Designs.
 Jerry Pinto and Antara Dev Sen launched _Taboo_ which is available online and in bookstores.

Nirmala Govindrajan is a familiar sight where most of the city’s creative minds congregate; with her latest book _Taboo_ , she pretty much has earned herself a place in the sun with them.
 Nirmala began dabbling with writing as a college student and went on to become a journalist. Today, she conducts reading and writing workshops when she isn’t travelling.
 Though her books fall under the genre of literary fiction. Nirmala’s subjects are usually serious and deal with issues of trafficking, exploitation and child labour. Heavily laced with allegories and metaphors, presented in a stream of consciousness style of writing, Nirmala’s latest book _Taboo_ is doused with subtle humour and takes a satirical dig at snobs, despite its grave content.
 “Most of my characters are based on the memory of someone I may have seen sometime,” says Nirmala, adding it could be their name, mannerism or just the way she remembers them that triggers her imagination into fleshing them out in her books. While both _Hunger’s Daughters_ , her previous book, and _Taboo_ deal with pressing social issues in a stylistically similar fashion, Nirmala is quick to clarify they are not factual documentation stemming from real life exposure.
