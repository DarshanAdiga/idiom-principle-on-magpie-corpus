 # In-person classes to resume Tuesday at Pathways Academy

 Times Telegram
 Pathways Academy in Ilion is on schedule to reopen to in-person learning Tuesday, according to Herkimer BOCES District Superintendent Sandra Sherwood.
 Herkimer-Fulton-Hamilton-Otsego BOCES was notified Oct. 12 of a confirmed positive COVID-19 case at Pathways Academy. The initial plan was to close the school to students and staff on Oct. 13 and reopen the following day after the building was cleaned and sanitized.
 The plan changed after contact tracing by Herkimer County Public Health determined that many Pathways Academy students and staff would have to quarantine. Instead, the shift to virtual instruction was extended through Oct. 19 with in-person learning to resume Tuesday, Oct. 20.
 When contacted Monday morning, Sherwood said there had been no notifications from Public Health of additional positive cases and she expected the school to reopen Tuesday as scheduled.
 During the period of virtual instruction, students were following their regular schedules in a virtual format, according to a notice posted on the BOCES website. Pathways administrators planned to reach out to families to arrange for loaning devices as needed.
 Other BOCES sites were not impacted.
 Public Health met with school district officials prior to the start of the school year to discuss how they should respond in the event of a positive case, according to Sherwood. So far those plans have been put into action twice at West Canada Valley, once at Mount Markham Central School and once in one of the Career and Technical Education programs at the Herkimer BOCES William E. Busacker Complex in Herkimer.

 # Polk grand jury indicts 2 men in December shooting at Wahneta growhouse
 Suzie Schottelkotte
 The Ledger
 BARTOW — The Polk County grand jury has indicted a Lakeland man and another from West Palm Beach in connection with a December 2019 shooting that left one man dead at a Wahneta house where marijuana allegedly was being illegally grown.
 Julio Ramirez-Peraza, 47, of Lakeland, and Lazaro Perez-Toledo, 39, of West Palm Beach, each have been indicted on allegations of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit armed robbery and attempted robbery with a firearm.
 The indictment stems from the shooting death of Raidel Armas-Gonzalez, 50, of Mulberry, who was gunned down in the yard at 441 Fernandez St. in Wahneta during the evening of Dec. 18, 2019. Marcos Gutierrez, 49, told Polk County Sheriff’s Office deputies that he and Armas-Gonzalez worked together on home renovations, and he had come to Gutierrez’s house about 8 p.m. that night to stay so they could go to work together in the morning, according to PCSO reports.
 Gutierrez told deputies he had met Armas-Gonzalez when he arrived, but had walked back inside when he heard a single gunshot. He came outside and found his friend lying on his stomach in the yard.
 According to a Sheriff’s Office arrest affidavit, three people were seen on surveillance video parking a van at a convenience store and gas station near Logistic Parkway shortly before the shooting occurred. Surveillance video in the area also showed the three people walking along a wooded path toward the Fernandez Street house where Armas-Gonzalez was.
 “The video shows a muzzle flash and the three figures leaving in the direction they came — the direction of the wooded path that connects 441 Fernandez St. to Logistic Parkway,” the Sheriff’s Office affidavit states.
 Cellphone technology, vehicle records and highway toll information led investigators to Ramirez-Peraza and Perez-Toledo, their affidavits stated.
 Others have been charged in connection with the case, as well. Rolando Zamora- Menendez, 57, of Lakeland, and Gutierrez are charged with manufacture of cannabis, possession of drug paraphernalia and maintaining a structure for the manufacture or sale of a controlled substance, court records show. Gutierrez also is charged with trafficking in cannabis.
 Juan Carlos Garcia, 33, of Lakeland, Yurien Escalona Diaz, 37, of Miami and Zamora-Menendez each are charged with accessory after the fact to a capital felony, and Diaz also faced one count of conspiracy to commit armed robbery.
 Ramirez-Peraza is being held in the Polk County Jail without bail, according to jail records, and Perez-Toledo remains in custody in Miami, awaiting extradition to stand trial in Polk County, according to jail records.
