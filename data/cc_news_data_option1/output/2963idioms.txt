With Konami showing no signs of releasing Suikoden from purgatory, some of the original development team have banded together to create their own JRPG with 100 recruitable characters and the other trappings of the classic series. The Kickstarter for Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes launched on Monday and was almost immediately completely funded.
 Eiyuden Chronicle will see you exploring the continent of Allraan, apparently a diverse land that's been "shaped by the alliances and aggressions of the humans, beastmen, elves and desert people who live there." One nation, the Galdean Empire, has grown more powerful than its neighbours thanks to its discovery of magic-amplifying tech, and now it's on the hunt for an artefact to enhance its power even more.
 It's a 2.5D affair, with handsome PS1-era sprites wandering around more detailed, lavish environments, evocative of Octopath Traveler. You'll explore in real-time, but the fights are turn-based battles that let you bring in six characters to duke it out for you. Characters can also learn special customisable abilities that they use on their own, some of which can be linked up to other characters' abilities. As you recruit more, you'll be able to mix and match to find new synergies.
 Speaking of recruitment, you'll be able to find 100 characters to join your cause, ranging from warriors to bakers. Some you'll throw into battle, but you'll also need to expand your fortress town by putting your new mates to work. Eventually you'll be able to bolster it with walls, create new weapons, build farms and develop businesses like restaurants and a blacksmith. There's cooking, too, with recipes to learn and dishes to create in the cafeteria. If your cafeteria gets popular enough, you can turn it into a franchise and open up new places across Allraan and compete with rival restaurants.
 It all sounds very good and very Suikoden, so it perhaps shouldn't be a surprise that it managed to sprint past its $500,000 goal. It only took a few hours, and since then it's been barrelling through the stretch goals, which include the aforementioned fortress town mode and cafeteria minigame. The stretch goals go up to $1.8 million at the moment, leaving four more to go, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that target reached today.
 Development is expected to take at least a couple of years, with the current estimated release date being October 2022.

Her claim to fame was Guru Dutt's Aar Paar (1954). The song Kabhi aar kabhi paar was first picturised on Jagdeep but the censors reportedly wanted it to be picturised on a female artiste and hence Kumkum got chosen. Guru Dutt, who was reportedly in a hurry to finish the film, choreographed the song himself. It became hugely famous and Kumkum became a star. Guru Dutt gave her an acting role as well. She played his bhabhi in the satire Mr and Mrs '55 (1955) and played the mother of five children despite being quite young at that point of time.

LONDON - The auction house Sotheby’s is holding an online sale featuring artwork that spans five centuries of art history, from Rembrandt to Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró to Banksy.
 After months of disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak, the sale of 70 artworks - from the 17th century up to the present day - will be live-streamed Tuesday from Sotheby’s London.
 “With the global art world calendar having shifted, we too have seized the opportunity to do things differently,” said Helena Newman, chair of Sotheby’s Europe. The auction caters to “a new generation of a collectors (who) show less concern with the traditional art market categories of the past,” she added.
 The most valuable paintings include Miró’s “Peinture (Femme au chapeau rouge)” from 1927, estimated to sell for 20 to 30 million pounds ($25-37.5 million), and a self-portrait by Rembrandt from 1632, one of only three in private hands. The Rembrandt is estimated to fetch up to 12 million pounds ($20 million.)
 The auction also includes a triptych by Banksy called “Mediterranean Sea View,” painted in 2017. The panel of three paintings, presented in elaborate traditional frames, features orange life jackets and alludes to the lives lost at sea during the European migrant crisis. Proceeds from the paintings, expected to fetch from $1 to $1.5 million, will raise money for a hospital in Bethlehem.
 Sotheby’s London said some two-thirds of the art on sale has never been at auction before. Of the rest, most had been off the market for two decades.

 "There are crowding issues, ventilation issues, security issues where people have to be checked and monitored fairly frequently," Greifinger says. "So it's really hard to do."

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard fired a missile from a helicopter targeting a replica aircraft carrier in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, state television reported on Tuesday, an exercise aimed at threatening the U.S. amid tensions between Tehran and Washington.The drill, in a waterway through which 20% of all traded oil passes, underlines the lingering threat of military conflict between Iran and the U.S. after last summer saw a series of incidents targeting oil tankers in the region. In January, a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and Tehran responded by firing ballistic missiles targeting American forces in Iraq.While the coronavirus pandemic has engulfed both Iran and the U.S. for months, there have been increasing signs of a confrontation as America argues&nbsp;to extend a yearslong U.N. weapons embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October. A recent incident&nbsp;over Syria involving an American jet fighter approaching an Iranian passenger plane&nbsp;also has renewed tensions.Iranian commandos fast-roped down from a helicopter onto the replica in the footage aired Tuesday from the exercise called “Great Prophet 14.” Other footage showed fast boats encircling the mock-up, kicking up white waves in their wake.Iranian troops also fired anti-aircraft batteries at a drone target in the exercise from a location that state television described as being near the port city of Bandar Abbas. Troops also fired missiles launched from trucks on land and fast boats at sea, as well as shoulder-fired missiles.The Guard will use “long-range ballistic missiles with the ability to hit far-reaching aggressor floating targets” during the drill, said Abbas Nilforoushan, the Guard’s deputy commander for operations, according to Guard website sepahnews.com. That suggests the drill could see a repeat of what happened in 2015, when the Guard mock-sunk a replica.It wasn't immediately clear if all the footage was from Tuesday, as one overhead surveillance image that appeared to be shot by a drone bore Monday's date. The exercise had been expected as&nbsp;satellite photos released Monday showed the fake carrier being moved into place by a tugboat.A black-and-white satellite photo taken Tuesday by Colorado-based firm Maxar Technologies showed damage to the replica's bow and several of its fake jet fighters.“Our policies to protect the vital interests of the dear nation of Iran are defensive, in the sense that we will not invade any country from the beginning, but we are completely aggressive in tactics and operations,” Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, was quoted as saying. “What was shown today at this exercise at the level of aerospace and naval forces was all offensive.”State TV footage also showed Guard scuba forces underwater, followed by a cutaway to a blast hole just above the waterline on the replica carrier.That appeared to be a not-so- subtle reminder of U.S. accusations last year that Iran planted limpet mines on passing oil tankers near the strait, which exploded on the vessels in the same area. Iran has repeatedly denied the actions, though&nbsp;footage captured by the American military showed Guard members remove an unexploded mine from one vessel.The replica used in the drill resembles the Nimitz-class carriers that the U.S. Navy routinely sails into the Persian Gulf from the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the waterway. The USS Nimitz, the namesake of the class, just entered Mideast waters late last week from the Indian Ocean, likely to replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Arabian Sea.It remains unclear when or if the Nimitz will pass through the Strait of Hormuz or not during its time in the Mideast. The USS Abraham Lincoln, deployed last year as tensions initially spiked, spent months in the Arabian Sea before heading through the strait. The Eisenhower came through the strait early last week.To Iran, which shares the strait with Oman, the American naval presence is akin to Iranian forces sailing into the Gulf of Mexico near the coast of Florida. But the U.S. Navy stresses the strait is an international waterway crucial to global shipping and energy supplies. Even as America now relies less on Mideast oil, a major disruption in the region could see prices rapidly rise.Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet that patrols the Mideast, said officials were aware of the Iranian exercise involving “a vessel similar to a motionless aircraft carrier.”“The U.S. Navy conducts defensive exercises with our partners promoting maritime security in support of freedom of navigation whereas Iran conducts offensive exercises, attempting to intimidate and coerce,” Rebarich told The Associated Press.“While we are always watchful of this type of irresponsible and reckless behavior by Iran in the vicinity of busy international waterways, this exercise has not disrupted coalition operations in the area nor had any impacts to the free flow of commerce in the Strait of Hormuz and surrounding waters,” she added.___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
