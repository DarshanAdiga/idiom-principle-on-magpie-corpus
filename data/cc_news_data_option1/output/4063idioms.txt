The Toronto Maple Leafs hit the ground running at the opening bell of NHL free agency.
 The club signed gritty, hometown winger Wayne Simmonds to a one-year, US$1.5-million contract shortly after the market opened at noon ET on Friday.
 The 32-year-old has registered 251 goals and 499 points in 909 career games with the Los Angeles Kings, Philadelphia Flyers, Nashville Predators, New Jersey Devils and Buffalo Sabres over his 12 NHL seasons.
 The 61st pick in the 2007 draft by Los Angeles has added 21 points (eight goals, 13 assists) in 44 playoff outings, and should add some sandpaper to a talent-rich roster that general manager Kyle Dubas said earlier this week needs to be harder to play against.
 The Winnipeg Jets made the day's first big move — albeit on the trade front — by re-acquiring veteran centre Paul Stastny from the Vegas Golden Knights for defenceman Carl Dahlstrom and a conditional fourth-round draft pick in the 2022 draft. Stastny, sent to the Jets from the St. Louis Blues at the 2018 trade deadline, left the Manitoba capital via free agency that summer following Winnipeg's run to the Western Conference final.
 The Columbus Blue Jackets started moving chess pieces around their board Thursday with a couple of moves, including buying out centre Alexander Wennberg and trading defenceman Ryan Murray to New Jersey for a draft pick.
 The Montreal Canadiens, meanwhile, re-signed pending restricted free-agent defenceman Victor Mete to a one-year deal shortly before noon Friday, and Bobby Ryan found a new home in Detroit, inking a one-year pact after the 2020 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy winner was bought out by the Ottawa Senators.

One of the most unsettling aspects of the movie is Lyne’s masterful transition between the mundane grittiness of ’70s New York and the sudden turns into surrealist horror.

In such scenes, the viewer ends up feeling like a frog who hasn’t realized the pot of water is getting hotter until the moment it reaches a boil.

Wichita State's internal investigation could obviously lead to Marshall, a 57-year-old former Naismith Coach of the Year, losing his job despite the fact that he's taken the Shockers to seven of the past eight NCAA Tournaments and all the way to the Final Four in 2013. And if Marshall does lose his job over this, hopefully it'll send a message -- _another_ message -- to college coaches from coast to coast that the days of bully-coaching should be completely in the past. To be clear, not everybody puts their hands on players like Marshall allegedly did. But far too many coaches, even Hall of Fame coaches, have spent their careers yelling and screaming, constantly demeaning and ridiculing their players in ways that should be unacceptable, and _would_ be unacceptable, if not for the weird power dynamic that exists on many campuses.
 I've seen it with my own eyes.
 No college professor would ever be allowed to talk to a student the way so many college coaches talk to student-athletes. It's crazy. But it's also very common, mostly because, I guess, it's just always been that way. There's a line between motivating and humiliating, and coaches cross that line all the time -- usually behind closed doors in practices shielded from the public, but sometimes even on national television during games. Things you rarely see NBA coaches do or say college coaches do and say all the time to the point where it's normalized, rationalized and excused. As a result, even in the year 2020, fans are still more likely to laugh than be offended when a college coach absolutely loses his mind on a college player.
 Is that really OK?
 I've argued, for a while now, that it's not. You don't have to humiliate someone to motivate them. You don't have to demean someone to push them. And putting your hands on anybody is way out of bounds.
