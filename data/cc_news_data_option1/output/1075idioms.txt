For the last few years, my morning ritual has included clicking on to worldconcerthall.com when I first turn on my computer, cappuccino in hand. I do it before I look at The Times or anything else. This site from Barcelona, Spain, is a terrific resource that claims to offer “every online concert in this world.”
 They’re not all there, but you will find listings for an average of two dozen concerts broadcast from around the world any given day. A few are live events; the rest tend to be recordings of performances that took place in recent weeks. Most come from Europe, because a number of radio stations in capitals overseas broadcast concerts daily. American stations do so to a lesser extent and are included.
 It had long been my intention to take a week or two break from concertgoing and just check out what’s happening around the world. Now, obviously, is that time. It’s been revealing, even revelatory.
 Concert life continues en masse on radio. Besides that, everywhere you turn you can find orchestras, concert halls and opera companies streaming from their archives, and now a few are giving live concerts online without an audience.

The riches are inexhaustible. But, first, beware of what you wish for. These are not normal times and let us not pretend they are. When used as an exercise in intent listening, classical music has the capacity to make you newly sensitive to your environment, while also asking (when not outright insisting) that you confront your feelings.
 More and more, it has thrived as an art form that does not respect social distancing. Concert halls are built to be intimate and without a proscenium stage, to make the audience feel closer to the performers. Immersive opera is all the rage. As is headphone listening, which is uniquely intimate — just the music and your brain.
 We’ve still got our headphones (no more sharing them, though). But our brains have been rewired by the shocking coronavirus pandemic.

Frankly, I find the recent live concerts without audiences unnerving. The Berlin Philharmonic has made its Digital Concert Hall — the most technologically advanced of all orchestral live video streaming services — free for the time being. It tried playing a performance of Berio’s “Sinfonia,” conducted by Simon Rattle, without an audience Thursday. That meant a hundred or so musicians sitting next to one another. Winds, brass and singers, spraying spittle.
 The performance was outstanding, but I couldn’t keep from thinking how unnatural all this was — a little creepy even in the empty hall. Plus, Berio was on the case when he wrote the score in the Bay Area in 1968 as a reaction to all the political turmoil surrounding him. In the third movement, which includes a collage of spoken text, there is this uncanny excerpt from Samuel Beckett’s “The Unnamable”: “That’s the show waiting for the show … and the spectators, where are they, you didn’t notice, in the anguish of waiting, never noticed you were waiting alone.” Near the movement’s end, we hear that “it’s quite hopeless. ... But it can’t go on.”
 After that I couldn’t bear another minute. Then Saturday night the Oregon Symphony wised up. It canceled its planned webcast of Berio’s “Sinfonia” for the safety of the orchestra.
