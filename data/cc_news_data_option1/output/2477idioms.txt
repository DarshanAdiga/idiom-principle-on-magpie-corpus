LA GRANDE — As the weather continues to warm in the Grande Ronde Valley, the water of the Grande Ronde River looks more inviting. However, the Wallowa- Whitman National Forest is warning those who go out onto the river to be cautious as they float along as dangers lurk below and above the surface.


  The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest has been working to restore a fish habitat upstream of La Grande. In doing so, large logs and boulders, side channels, deep pools, gravel bars and a variety of riparian vegetation have been placed along the river to create habitats. While this is wonderful for the natural life in the river, it can cause problems for people who visit the waters.


  “Logs placed in and across the channel, and embedded in riverbanks, have many sharp stubs and branches that could snag a watercraft or clothing and trap a person underwater,” said Peter Fargo, public affairs officer for the Wallowa- Whitman. “River currents are powerful and unpredictable, and they need to be treated with added caution and respect when combined with recent restoration features.”


  Fargo said the best way to remain safe is to avoid the areas of recent restoration projects. Those interested in floating on the river can view the river flows on the Oregon Water Resources Department Near Real Time Hydrographics Data webpage.


  Boaters and floaters should follow all river safety practices, especially in whitewater or more turbulent areas, including wearing a lifejacket regardless of float or boat type or difficulty of the waters, not recreating under the influence and knowing weather and water conditions before you go. The Forest Service also reminded people not to stand up in a moving river.


  Habitat restoration work on the Grande Ronde River has been done between Red Bridge State Park and Spring Creek, and along 8 miles adjacent to the 51 road. The next area to be worked on is near Longley Meadows. Construction will begin during 2020 and is likely to be completed sometime in 2021.


  The Wallowa-Whitman National Forest has posted signs where restoration projects have occurred and an upated map of these projects can be found on the department’s website.

PLYMOUTH - When the Cordage Soccer Club met on March 7 for a practice at the Plymouth Sports Complex nobody had an idea that it was going to be the last time players and coaches would see each other for a long stretch of time.
 Within a week after that practice the growing coronavirus pandemic exploded and sports at every level were all changed for the foreseeable future. Small steps towards getting back to normal were taken Tuesday and Thursday when the Plymouth-based club soccer program began group practices once again at the Hedges Pond soccer field with a multitude of new safety precautions in place.
 "I'm not going to lie. It was a little emotional for everyone to get back together as an entire group once again," Cordage Soccer Club co-owner April Liuzzi said. "It was the first time we'd all seen each other in this kind of a setting in a couple months, which was great, but the bittersweet part was there were nothing happening like high-fives or fist bumps between the coaches and the players. But the players were good about it. They knew they had to follow some new rules in order to play right now."
 That lack of physical contact is part of several changes to the way practices must be done at the moment.
 When players now arrive at the field before each soccer practice they are asked to go to a designated area until they are called over by their coach. All the players are required to bring face masks as well as their own soccer ball to each session. Everyone has their hands sanitized when they get to the field and no siblings can be around the field during practice like they been allowed to in the past.
 Players are also encouraged to use social distancing whenever possible as they go through their individual drills.
 "We are following the state guidelines for best practices," Luizzi said. "I feel good with the guidelines we are being provided. We're working on developing the individual skills of each player with no scrimmages or games happening at the moment."
 Established in 2017, Liuzzi and Plymouth native Kyria Gallagher became owners of the Cordage Soccer Club this past January. Liuzzi is president; Gallagher serves as vice-president of the group. Both coach youth teams within the program.
 Cordage Soccer Club is a year-round program for boys and girls between the ages of six to 18-years-old. There are around 125 players in the program at the moment, mostly from Plymouth, with others from surrounding towns as well as Cape Cod also mixed in.
 Plans are for the club team to play in some tournaments when they are allowed to be held once again in the future and to compete in the Club Championship League that's scheduled right now to start in September.

By Kelechi Mejuobi   It was the dying minutes production time of an Owerri based print media outfit last week Thursday before story changed. As the pages were being arranged in proper shape with relevant stories for the next day publication, a news item had been properly written and tucked in for production by one of the correspondents who covered an event at the palace of the Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers. According to her report due for the front page of the next day, was "Eze Okeke Replaces Eze Ohiri As EzeImo, Inaugurates Chairmen For LGAs"   The content of the initial story was that the Eze Imo Palace where Eze Ohiri had been dictating the pace of the Ndi Eze Imo affairs had been overtaken by Eze Okeke, the traditional ruler of Amaifeke town in Orlu LGA of Imo State.   Okeke was a fortnight ago appointed and subsequently inaugurated as Chairman of Imo Traditional Institution and Community Policing. The new disposition was coming at the heels of the repeal of the Community Government Council, CGG Law, a quasi Fourth Tier arm of government introduced during the Rochas Okorocha regime which empowered monarchs in the various LGAs to head the CGG in their domains as well as the amendment of the Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers law which empowers the state governor to appoint officials of the royal fathers' body than through election process. The Okeke appointment sent a signal of a possible subtle means that had ended Ohiri's tenure as Eze Imo.   The suspicion was further fuelled by a publication of the Imo State Government owned tabloid; The Statesman in one of its banner lead story which states " Eze Okere Becomes Eze Imo"   As this particular newspaper was settling down with the story of Okeke "taking over from Ohiri" based on the report that the former stormed the Eze Imo palace on Mbari Street, Owerri to demand for the keys from the latter, accompanied by some government officials for the inauguration of the LGA chapter chairmen, the state government surprisingly came up with a press release disclosing that it was yet to appoint a Chairman for the Ndi Eze Imo.   Surprised at the development, the editorial head reached out to the state Commissioner for Information, Mbadiwe Declan Emelumba who confirmed the government position and consequently sent an official statement on the matter. The release forced the print media to now engage in late minute change of headline from "Eze Okeke Takes Over from Eze Ohiri As Ndi Eze Imo Council Chairman" “Imo Government Opens Up On Eze Council Chair, Denies Eze Okeke"   The statement from Emelumba reads;   "GOVT YET TO APPOINT CHAIRMAN IMO STATE COUNCIL OF TRADITIONAL RULERS   "Imo state government has announced that it is yet to appoint a chairman for Imo state council of traditional Rulers but will do so at the appropriate time   "A statement yesterday by the commissioner for information and strategy, Declan Emelumba, said that the explanation became necessary following the high level of rumours and speculations making the rounds on the appointment of chairman of Imo state council of traditional Rulers.   "He advised the Imo public to discountenance any claim by any person purporting to have been appointed chairman of Imo state traditional institutions   "The government has not yet appointed anybody as chairman of Imo state traditional institutions or council of Ndieze. This will be done at the appropriate time and announced accordingly" the statement said, adding that the public should disregard any claim to the contrary.   It is evidently clear that the statement from Government has no doubt raised more questions than answers concerning the Eze Imo Chairman issue if events surrounding happenings around monarchs are anything to go by.   Earlier, apparently aware of government plot to make a mincemeat of his chairmanship position, Ohiri who has been in the saddle had objected to the action of Imo State House of Assembly Members in amending the Imo State Autonomous Communities and Allied Matters Law No 15 of 2016 which hitherto, conferred on the Traditional Rulers the Right and Powers to elect their Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Ndi Eze council. But through the recent amendment, such right has been stripped.   Ohiri, the Obi of Orodo in Mbaitoli LGA who was appointed by Okorocha administration in 2011 and had had years of legal battle with his predecessor, Eze Cletus Ilomuanya of over wrongful termination when the former governor was elected nine years ago, kicked against the new amendment.   Even as Ohiri continues to claim he is still the chairman as published in the newspapers, Okeke has been receiving congratulatory messages from the public as the new Eze Imo.   There appears to be theatre of absurdities in the whole arrangement to warrant the state government be decisive in its decision to enable the monarchs be clarified on who is truly in-charge.   Irrespective of divergent media positions on who is the authentic Eze Imo, these underlying posers mentioned below are before the state government for further clarification except there is incriminating intent to surreptitiously entrench anarchy in the traditional institution in Imo.   For the avoidance of doubt, since the Imo State House of Assembly repealed the CGC law, did it affect Ndi Eze Imo law and position of Eze Ohiri as Chairman?   Has the amended law of the Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers automatically relieved Eze Ohiri of his position as the Eze Imo council chairman?   What is the relationship between the Imo Traditional Institution and Community Policing Okeke has been appointed as Chairman against the Ohiri led Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers before the recent amendment of the law?   Is there any law of the state known as Imo Traditional Institution and Community Policing for the governor to appoint a Chairman who will now assume the position of Ndi Eze Imo chairman?   Doesn't it amount to double standard and fuelling complicity in the Eze Imo saga for the state government to have allowed its print medium, The Statesman newspaper to have rolled out a banner headline announcing Okeke new Eze Imo in one edition and coming back to say government has not announced a new Eze Imo in another publication?   Why didn't the Imo State Government issue a rejoinder or disclaimer to the first story published by The Statesman which claimed Okeke had been appointed Eze Imo before coming up with a contrasting version?   Why did the state Commissioner for Information as the supervisory Commissioner in-charge of Statesman take about a week before issuing a counter statement against the position of the state owned medium?   The discombulation arising from the position of the government also raises concern about the status of Ohiri in view of the fact that the law that brought him into power has been repealed and the governor, according to the Information Commissioner is yet to appoint a new Eze. Therefore, does it mean in the spirit of the new law Ohiri is no longer functioning as Eze Imo and the sit is now vacant waiting for the new appointee?   The answers to these questions have become necessary for bewildered minds since the Eze Imo stool is a highly revered position in the state's traditional institution

As Kareem Hunt studies the Browns' new wide zone blocking scheme, he draws excitement from Dalvin Cook's 2019 season.


   


  A running back operating in the system of then-Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski, Cook finished 10th in the NFL in rushing with 1,135 yards and 13 touchdowns. Cook's backup, rookie Alexander Mattison, contributed 462 yards.


   


  When new Browns coach Stefanski was elevated to Vikings offensive coordinator in Week 15 of 2018, Cook responded with a season-high 136 yards and two touchdowns against the Miami Dolphins.


   


  That seemingly bodes well for the Browns' dynamic tandem of Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb and Hunt, the 2017 NFL rushing leader with the Kansas City Chiefs.


   


  "I talk to Nick; we talk a lot. We definitely feel like we can thrive because we see how Dalvin Cook was doing last year in Stefanski's offense, he didn't disappoint," Hunt said Monday during a Zoom video conference with Browns media. "They had another running back that didn't disappoint, either. We definitely think we can take advantage of that of the zone run scheme."


   


  Browns' pass game coordinator/receivers coach Chad O'Shea said during a Wednesday Zoom call that he had been very impressed with Hunt's receiving skills. In eight games last season after his return from league suspension, Hunt caught 37 passes for 285 yards and a TD, and rushed for 179 yards on 43 carries and two more scores.


   


  That could lead to a multi-faceted role for Hunt this season, although he doesn't know how it will play out.


   


  "I'm looking forward to that. However they want to use me, just let me know," Hunt said.


   


  Stefanski's challenge will be to keep his stars happy in an offense loaded with weapons, including receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Jarvis Landry.


   


  "Every game everybody's not going to have a big game. If we win, that's the only thing that matters and we've got to understand that," Hunt said. "If we're winning, I'm not mad. I'm going to do whatever, if that's blocking to help win, touchdowns.


   


  "Some games Odell might have 200 yards; some games Nick might have 400 yards or whatever and Jarvis might have like 10…."


   


  Mayfield leads


   


  Hunt said he has been impressed with third-year quarterback Baker Mayfield, whom Hunt said has been "leading all the meetings, he's in and out of everybody's meetings" during the virtual offseason.


   


  "I'm supposed to go throw with Baker coming up soon to get some routes in with some other guys. We're going to try to be on the same page, everybody, with what's going on so we can come back hitting on all cylinders," Hunt said.


   


  Mayfield held a minicamp of sorts in Austin, Texas, this spring, but repeating it seems unlikely. Dr. Thom Mayer, medical director of the NFL Players Association, released a statement Saturday recommending that players stop practicing together until the start of training camp. Mayer cited the recent surge of COVID-19 cases in several states and positive test results among NFL players and team employees, which could threaten the start of the 2020 season.


   


  Until camp, Hunt may be limited to training in Northeast Ohio. He said he's been working out twice a day with his former Willoughby South High School track coach Matt Luck, who has a treadmill and weight room at his home. Hunt said the sessions include running hills.


   


  Ending injustice


   


  With protests over racial injustice erupting after the May 25 killing of George Floyd, kneeled on for nearly nine minutes by a Minneapolis police officer, Hunt said he has spoken to Landry and other teammates on the issue.


   


  "I'm looking forward to see what they've got planned and help because it's definitely something we need to fix," Hunt said. "I feel like the world needs to become a better place … everybody."


   


  Tedeschi dies


   


  Ron Tedeschi, one of driving forces behind the annual Akron Browns Backers banquet held at Tangier restaurant, passed away last week at age 93. A Central Hower High School graduate and one of the founding members of the Browns Backers club, Tedeschi helped raise money for multiple charities through the banquet, an event held for 35 years, last in 2014.

“This is in our DNA,” said Gilles Gade, Cross River’s founder and chief executive. “It’s exactly what we were built for.”


  In normal times, Cross River is a largely invisible partner for dozens of companies like Affirm, which offers on-the-spot financing for online purchases, and Upgrade and Upstart, which make personal loans. It is accustomed to high-volume, low-dollar lending.


  But the Paycheck Protection Program was an opportunity on a whole new scale, with small businesses across the country applying for hundreds of millions of dollars in emergency aid. More than 30 firms funneled some or all of their borrowers through Cross River, including large companies like Intuit, the maker of the popular QuickBooks accounting software, and Kabbage, an online small-business lender. Other borrowers arrived through niche businesses like Divvy, an expense management tool, and Womply, a small-business marketing system, that wanted to serve their customers.


  Cross River’s role is, by design, behind the scenes. Jessica Smith applied for a loan nearly as soon as the relief program began, in early April, but was “ghosted,” she said, by her original lender. So she turned to Pearl Capital, which she had used before for a merchant cash advance for her Bella Vita Salon and Spa in Saugatuck, Michigan.


  “I got word that I was approved the next day,” Smith said.


  When the loan’s closing documents arrived, Cross River’s name was on them. Her cash arrived a week later. She reopened last week and plans to use her loan to pay her workers as business returns.


  The average loan through the paycheck program is about $111,000, but Cross River’s are much smaller: $44,062 on average, by far the lowest of the program’s 15 largest lenders, according to data from the Small Business Administration, which oversees the program.


  Those tiny loans add up. Cross River has lent a total of $4.7 billion — nearly twice the assets the bank had on its books less than three months ago, according to a regulatory filing. On its average loan, the bank collects a fee from the government of around $2,200, a portion of which is shared with the company that brought in the customer.

“It’s my professional opinion that it’s important to wear masks when out in public. We are considered a hot spot. I’ve looked through the numbers, and they have significantly increased in the last 23 days. We went from having 20 some cases total through the months of March, April and May to having (hundreds of new cases) in the span of the last couple of weeks.”
 The recent spike in cases can’t solely be blamed on the fact that people have relaxed their stance on wearing masks while running errands, she said. Most of it has to do with the country’s relaxation of pandemic restrictions as the economy struggles to come back from the mandatory shutdown. However, “one of the ways we can protect ourselves is by wearing a mask. Mask wearing for a couple of weeks or even a week — we may start seeing some of those (local) numbers decrease.”
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say people should wear masks when they leave their homes and should always have a mask — either cloth masks or the popular blue/white paper masks — when social distancing is impossible. CDC researchers have been conducting a scientific review about masks and plan to issue new guidelines on wearing masks soon.
 “We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms (asymptomatic) and that even those who eventually develop symptoms (pre-symptomatic) can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms," the CDC says on its website. "This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing — even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms.”
 In light of this new evidence, the CDC recommends wearing masks or cloth face coverings in public settings, “especially in areas of significant community- based transmission.”
 When wearing a mask, Liberty said, it’s paramount to only touch the portion of the mask that loops around the ears; never touch the outer part of the mask that covers the face. And never touch the eyes, nose or mouth while wearing a mask.
 “It’s so hard to not touch your face. I see people working at their masks, and I’m just as guilty of it when I’m out. … I want to pull out the bottom to breathe a bit better. But just consider the front of the mask to be contaminated … and full of germs," she continued. "And if you do touch it, make sure that you wash your hands.”
 When it comes to cleaning masks, cloth masks should be washed after each use, said Donna Stokes, Mercy Hospital Joplin's infection control coordinator.
 "This can be done in a standard washing machine with regular detergent and the hottest water the fabric will allow. Masks can be dried in a hot-temperature dryer or can be air-dried; a great idea is to place them in the sun to dry. Be sure your mask dries completely before reusing it," she said.

BARTOW -- The Polk County government will have nearly $4 million less to work with in its new 2020-21 budget than it had before the COVID-19 pandemic arose.


   


  Todd Bond, the county's budget director, on Tuesday presented his final preview of next year's county budget to the Polk County Commission before he presents the full proposed budget on July 14.


   


  COVID-19 arrived before it could have much impact on 2020-21 property tax revenues, he said, so the budget includes a 26-cent decline in the recommended property tax rate to $6.90 per $1,000 of assessed property value, down from the current rate of $7.16.


   


  But the hit on the county's share of sales tax and other revenue was significant compared to revenue projections before COVID-19, Bond told The Ledger after the budget workshop.


   


  The county had projected receiving $38.8 million from state sales tax revenue in the new fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, or a 5% increase from the current budget, he said. It now projects a nearly 4% decline in sales tax revenue to $35.6 million.


   


  The county had also planned on a 3% increase in other state-shared revenue for 2020-21 to $16 million, Bond said. Now it's projecting a 3.3% decline to $15 million.


   


  The state money will support a projected $447.7 million general fund, which supports most county government services, such as law enforcement, fire protection and land development regulation, he said. That's up from the current $430 million general fund, part of a total $1.7 billion county budget.


   


  The county projects collecting $210.6 million in property taxes to support the 2020-21 budget, up from $198.3 million in the current budget, Bond told commissioners.


   


  Those figures could change slightly when the Property Appraiser's Office sends its final property valuations on July 1, Bond said. The current property valuation is $40 billion.


   


  "I don't know what the future holds, but it doesn't look rosy," Commission Chairman Bill Braswell said.


   


  There's a lot more uncertainty on the impact of COVID-19 to the state's economy and 2020-21 tax collections, he added.


   


  The proposed budget would add 38 new full-time employees to the county payroll, including 16 new people in the Fire Rescue Division and 9 workers in the Utilities Division, primarily water and sewer services.


   


  "I had reservations of growing government in light of the COVID-19 impacts," County Manager Bill Beasley said. "This is a measured approach."


   


  The county had planned on expanding the Fire Rescue Division since 2018, he said, and the Utilities Division needs more people to handle the workload from the county's residential growth.


   


  Commissioners said they viewed the staff increases, particularly for Fire Rescue, as a priority.


   


  The commission is scheduled to approve a tentative 2020-21 property tax rate at its July 21 meeting. It will vote on the final tax rate and budget after two public hearings in September.

  Dak Prescott plans to be at training camp with the Dallas Cowboys, if and when it starts, on the richest one-year contract in franchise history.


  There is also still time to work out a long-term deal for the star quarterback.


  Prescott signed his $31.4 million tender under the franchise tag Monday. That comes just over three weeks before the July 15 deadline to agree on a long- term deal.


  By signing the offer under the franchise tag, Prescott is obligated to report for all team activities or risk being fined. He didn't participate in the club's virtual offseason program while unsigned.


  Prescott played the final year of his rookie contract on a $2 million salary. He was the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year while leading the Cowboys to the NFC's top seed in the playoffs and won his first postseason game two years later.


  There has never been a question of whether Prescott is the franchise quarterback in Dallas. Owner Jerry Jones has repeatedly made that clear as the sides have spent more than a year trying to agree on a long-term contract.


  Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence has the highest per-year average in Dallas history at $21 million. The two-time Pro Bowler signed a $105 million, five- year deal last year.


  Prescott has started every game of his career after replacing the injured Tony Romo during the 2016 preseason. He led a franchise-record 11-game winning streak during the regular season before Dallas lost to Green Bay in the divisional round.


  The Cowboys missed the playoffs in Prescott's second year when fellow rookie sensation Ezekiel Elliott was suspended six games. With his running back in the fold for a full season in 2018, Prescott led Dallas to another NFC East title and a wild-card win over Seattle before losing to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round.


  The two-time Pro Bowler started his rookie season third on the depth chart after getting drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State. He moved up a spot when Kellen Moore was injured in training camp, and took over as the starter after Romo injured his back in a preseason game. Romo never got his job back.


  Despite missing the playoffs again last season, Prescott had career bests with 4,902 yards passing and 30 touchdowns.


  The Cowboys didn't renew coach Jason Garrett's contract after a season that fell far short of expectations and hired Mike McCarthy. The former Green Bay coach won a Super Bowl with Aaron Rogers a decade ago.

The film finished with $200.1 million domestically and $391.1 million globally, ranking sixth and eighth for 2006, respectively. With a production budget estimated around $270 million, the film was unfortunately regarded as a financial disappointment that put the franchise back on ice for another seven years.

"HBO Max will bring _Gone with The Wind_ back to its line-up, and when it appears, I will provide an introduction placing the film in its multiple historical contexts," Stewart stated. "For me, this is an opportunity to think about what classic films can teach us. Right now, people are turning to movies for racial re-education, and the top-selling books on Amazon are about anti- racism and racial inequality. If people are really doing their homework, we may be poised to have our most informed, honest and productive national conversations yet about Black lives on screen and off."


   _Gone With the Wind_ \-- which has long been revered by film critics and is the highest-grossing movie of all time when adjusting box office totals for inflation -- was decried in a high-profile op-ed in the _Los Angeles Times_, penned by _12 Years a Slave_ screenwriter John Ridley.


  Ridley called on HBO Max to pull the film -- which tells the story of a tumultuous love affair between two wealthy Southern aristocrats and is set against the backdrop of the end of the Civil War and the destruction of the Confederacy. Ridley argued that the movie "doesn't just 'fall short' with regard to representation. It is a film that glorifies the antebellum south."


  Earlier this month, a spokesperson for HBO Max explained in a statement to ET that the film would eventually return to its streaming catalog, along with additional content that would contextualize the controversial historical depictions and elements of the story.


  " _Gone With the Wind_ is a product of its time and depicts some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace in American society. These racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today, and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible," the statement read.


  "These depictions are certainly counter to WarnerMedia's values, so when we return the film to HBO Max, it will return with a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions, but will be presented as it was originally created, because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed," the statement continued. "If we are to create a more just, equitable and inclusive future, we must first acknowledge and understand our history."


  Following its removal from the platform, Megyn Kelly, Whoopi Goldberg and Meghan McCain, among others weighed in on the decision. Kelly took to Twitter to decry the streaming service's announcement as censorship of a "cultural touchstone."


  Goldberg suggested to her _The View_ co-hosts, including McCain, that the streaming service add a disclaimer before the film, alerting viewers to the context of the production.


   _Gone With the Wind_ is still currently available for online rental on Amazon Prime Video, iTunes, YouTube and more.


  Following George Floyd's tragic death, protests have been happening nationwide, as well as in numerous countries around the world, to stop police brutality and systemic racism.


  As discussions about how cops are portrayed on TV arose, _Live P.D._ and _Cops_ were canceled by A&E Networks and Paramount Network, respectively.

Dissent from their approved views is not just considered an error, much less an innocent one. It is considered immoral, illegitimate, and unworthy of a public hearing. Although both left and right have moved steadily toward this abyss, the worst excesses today come from the left, just as they came from the right in the 1950s. Opponents are seen in religious terms, as dangerous apostates who deserve to be burned at the stake, at least symbolically. You never expect the Spanish Inquisition. Yet here it is. That is the powerful iconography behind torching police cars and neighborhood stores.

Each time Carrie Elvey and her golden retriever walk through the woods behind their home, she stops to check herself and her dog for ticks before heading back inside.


   


  The senior naturalist at the Wilderness Center in Wilmot knows that ticks hide in tall grassy areas waiting to attach themselves to clothing or fur.


   


  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tick exposure can occur year-round with higher activity during warmer months. Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are the two most common tick-borne illnesses in the state, according to the Ohio Department of Health.


   


  "People should be cautious, but the mental and physical health benefits (of being outdoors) probably far out way the risk from mosquitoes and ticks," Elvey said. "Just using common precautions is what you should do."


   


  If a resident lives near a grassy or wooded area and is concerned about whether that area is a hot spot for ticks, Elvey recommends attaching a white sheet to a broom and raking it through the grassy area. If there is a high population of ticks, Elvey said, the insects should be visible on the white sheet.


   


  Ticks are easier to spot on light-colored material, she explained, which is why hikers should wear light-colored clothing when hitting the trails to make it easier to search for ticks.


   


  When walking at trails at The Wilderness Center, Barnes Preserve or Oak Hill Park, hikers should walk in the center of the trail as often as possible to stay away from grassy areas where ticks can hide, Elvey said.


   


  Stephanie Featheringill, director of Ashland County Park District, said volunteers work hard to keep the grass mowed on walking or hiking paths with natural trails.


   


  The district includes 18 parks with hiking trails at each location. The majority of the trails are grass with a few stone and paved paths, she said. Byers Wood and Freer Field each have a 1-mile paved trail.


   


  With two full-time staff members and a handful of part-time staffers, the majority of maintenance such as mowing is done by volunteers, Featheringill said. Volunteers mow a path as wide as 8 feet to help keep away from high grass, and typically mow once per week, she added.


   


  "Our volunteers help us out tremendously with keeping all of the grass and the trails looking nice, which does prevent ticks on the trails," Featheringill said.


   


  Lyme disease cases up


   


  Ticks can be active any time temperatures reach above 45 degrees, Sarah M. Short, assistant professor with Ohio State University's Department of Entomology.


   


  Ticks like to hide in warm, moist areas on the body, Short said. After being outdoors, Short recommended checking areas where the clothing meets the skin such as waistline, neck, ankle and knee as well as the hairline and groin.


   


  Spring and early summer is prime for nymph ticks, she said, which can be as small as a poppy seed and difficult to see. Blacklegged ticks -- also known as deer ticks -- and the American dog tick are most common in Ohio.


   


  Blacklegged ticks can transmit Lyme disease, Short, who holds a doctorate in genetics and development, explained. American dog ticks can not. Identifying ticks can be difficult; resources available on OSU's website can help with identification of tick types.


   


  Showering within a few hours of returning indoors can help wash off any ticks that have not yet attached to the body, she said.


   


  If someone finds a tick on them, they should remove it as soon as possible using a pair of pointy tweezers as recommended by the CDC.


   


  Ticks can be sent to TickReport.com for a fee to get the insect tested for disease, Short said.


   


  Short included safety recommendations and instructions for tick removal in a 13-minute video on OSU's website. In the video, Short explains that confirmed Lyme disease cases have doubled in Ohio within the last six years.


   


  "Preventing tick bites is key," Short said. "That's really what people want to do. Once you get a tick bite, you've opened the door to infection. You really want to avoid getting tick bites. It's not always possible, and if you can remove the tick as quickly as possible that really reduces the chance of Lyme disease, for example. But the best thing is prevention."

“Personal dislike of the industry is not a valid basis upon which to ground an antitrust investigation,” Elias said of the cannabis cases.


  The two accounts painted a damning portrait of the Justice Department under Barr, made all the more remarkable given that the witnesses were both still department employees. They increased pressure on Barr to further explain decisions related to criminal cases involving Trump’s associates and the abrupt firing of the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, who had overseen some of the investigations into Trump allies.


  Not long after the hearing got underway, the Justice Department announced that Barr had agreed to appear himself before the panel on July 28. Democrats had been threatening to issue a subpoena for his appearance. Seeking to further increase pressure on the attorney general, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the panel’s chairman, told reporters after the hearing that the committee “may very well” pursue impeachment proceedings against Barr — a highly unlikely outcome given the political reality of a fast-approaching election.


  During the hearing, lawmakers spent more time trying to argue divergent political points about Barr, Trump and the investigations that have hung over his presidency than they did eliciting facts about the Justice Department from either witness.


  “These are merely the symptoms of an underlying disease,” Nadler said in opening remarks. “The sickness that we must address is Mr. Barr’s use of the Department of Justice as a weapon to serve the president’s petty, private interests.”


  Democrats turned frequently to a third witness, Donald Ayer, who was deputy attorney general under President George H.W. Bush and warned that under Barr, the country was “on the way to something far worse than Watergate.”


  Republicans mounted an aggressive defense of Barr, relying on their witness, Michael Mukasey, who was attorney general under President George W. Bush, to try to deflate Democrats’ arguments.


  “The politics was in the previous administration,” said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top committee Republican. “Bill Barr is doing the Lord’s work trying to clean it up so that it doesn’t happen again.”

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of dollars in coronavirus relief payments have been sent to people behind bars across the United States, and now the IRS is asking state officials to help claw back the cash that the federal tax agency says was mistakenly sent.
 The legislation authorizing the payments during the pandemic doesn’t specifically exclude jail or prison inmates, and the IRS has refused to say exactly what legal authority it has to retrieve the money. On its website, it points to the unrelated Social Security Act, which bars incarcerated people from receiving some types of old-age and survivor insurance benefit payments.
 “I can’t give you the legal basis. All I can tell you is this is the language the Treasury and ourselves have been using,” IRS spokesman Eric Smith said. “It’s just the same list as in the Social Security Act.”

“I started training for an Ironman (triathlon) again,” said Riley, who lives in Gainesville.


  But his running pace was way off. He felt anxious and was having trouble sleeping. His blood pressure was unusually high. And, all of a sudden, he depended on reading glasses. Even so, he dismissed the symptoms as part of life or the aging process. Maybe, he thought to himself, he just needed to train harder.


  But his physician, Dr. Reisman, knew better. Reisman kept in close touch with Riley, monitoring his vitals and overall health. Riley’s blood pressure, usually about 125 over 60, was around 180 over 100.


  Riley didn’t need to go the hospital, but Reisman knew his patient was not over the coronavirus.


  For COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized, there is no specific drug or treatment, other than rest, fluids and fever-reducing medicine, such as Tylenol. Primary doctors monitor for red flags, such as trouble breathing, which would trigger an ER visit.


  Reisman knew about a post-COVID trial for survivors of mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Riley enrolled in the clinical trial for leronlimab, a drug that was originally developed to treat HIV, but is showing promise in the coronavirus fight. He had four injections in his stomach over two weeks.


  Riley said he immediately felt better. He returned to a faster pace, his blood pressure returned to normal and the other symptoms – the anxiety, the insomnia — faded.


  It’s possible he was given a placebo or perhaps it was time that helped him heal, but Riley is confident that it was the leronlimab.


  Doctor who was also COVID-19 patient


  Dr. Chris Recknor, a Gainesville internist who runs one of the six sites for the leronlimab clinical trial, is also a COVID-19 survivor.


  He first got sick in April, starting with an intense headache. Then, he started bumping into things and saw floaters in his eyes. Those aren’t the most common coronavirus symptoms, but he knew something wasn’t right and decided to get tested to, if nothing else, rule out the infectious virus. The test was positive.


  His conditioned worsened to the point where he thought he might have a heart attack. He ended up in ER at Northeast Georgia Medical Center three times and was twice admitted for overnight stays.


  “I felt like my heart was pumping so hard, it felt like it was coming out of my ears,” he said.


  His physician at the hospital obtained “compassionate use” permission from the Food and Drug Administration to prescribe leronlimab.


  Researchers think that the drug may work by calming the aggressive immune response called the “cytokine storm,” which occurs in ill COVID-19 patients.


  Recknor said he felt better within two days after getting the medication and has fully recovered.


  “The only way I can explain it is, it was like it felt like I had 1,000 cups of coffee,” said Recknor. “And then after the medicine, it was like a relaxing time on the beach. A couple days after the medicine, I was back to doing everything normal. I knew there were other people like me having crazy symptoms.”


  So Recknor, who is a clinical trialist and founder of the Center for Advanced Research & Education, contacted the drug company and offered to run one of the country’s clinical trial sites. Those in the trial are post-COVID survivors looking for relief after several weeks of battling the illness.


  Results from the Phase II clinical trial are expected in July.

If nothing else, Dallan Quigley is resilient.


   


  For every setback the Monterey Plainsman endured in high school, there was always a reward in the end. He lost the majority of his senior season, but ended high school on a high note after signing his national letter of intent with Mountain View College on Tuesday.


   


  "I know some of my friends don't get to go out and play college ball, but it's truly a blessing to continue playing baseball somewhere else," Quigley said.


   


  Some would say his smaller size is a disadvantage, but he doesn't see it that way. Quigley is inspired by players like Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve, who show that size isn't as much a factor if the skill and work ethic are in full effect.


   


  "(Altuve) does everything that no one thinks he could've done, so I look up to him as motivation," he said.


   


  Quigley did the same as a junior in 2019 by earning a varsity starting spot after impressing Plainsmen coach Kent Meador with his performance. No sooner than Quigley settled into the new role, however, he broke his left wrist diving for a ball in practice.


   


  "(That) was a typical way he went about his business," Meador said.


   


  While the Plainsmen went on a run to the Region I-5A finals, Quigley was there to support while working to get better behind the scenes.


   


  "It was rough at first," the outfielder/pitcher admitted. "There were hard moments, but I went to the gym and worked on lower body and made sure I was working out, at least so I can come back next year and improve on different stuff."


   


  Quigley had a strong start to his senior season, scoring 19 runs and batting .318 with a home run and five RBI in 54 plate appearances. Just as the Plainsmen were ready to get going in District 3-5A play, the season was suspended then canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  Much like before, though, Quigley kept pushing and earned a spot on a collegiate roster.


   


  The future Lion enjoyed his talks with head baseball coach Malcolm Walker and assistant coach Byron Carter. The more informed he became about the program, the more Quigley was convinced the Dallas-based community college was a good fit for him.


   


  "(Walker and Carter) said that if I work in the offseason and this fall league, then I'll have an opportunity to go somewhere after my first year," Quigley said.


   


  Meador has no doubt Quigley will earn that opportunity much like everything else he's achieved during his high-school career.


   


  "I want to thank God for this position," said Quigley, who plans to major in either computer science or justice law. "I want to thank my family and coach Meador's coaching staff for letting me play at Monterey for the last four years and being behind me every step of the way.


   


  "I also want to thank coach Walker and coach Carter from Mountain View for giving me the opportunity to play down there. … I feel like I can go down there and become more mature and do what I have to do to play the game I love and get my school in the next continuing years."

Sens. Joe Manchin III, D-W.Va., and Doug Jones, D-Ala., who is up for reelection in a strongly Republican state, also voted with the GOP to consider the bill.


  Democrats argued that had Republicans wanted to produce a substantive, bipartisan police proposal, they would have started with a template that included more input from them before letting the bill advance on the floor. In private, Democrats also spoke of their deep distrust of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and questioned whether he wanted a bipartisan bill to pass the Senate.


  Republicans repeatedly noted that Democrats could try to amend the bill on the Senate floor, and GOP senators privately offered amendment votes meant to address several criticisms of the bill that Schumer and Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., laid out in a letter to McConnell on Tuesday. The Democrats turned down that offer, according to two GOP officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss procedural deliberations, and also rejected a subsequent offer of more amendment votes.


  Scott privately told Democrats that if they did not get votes on amendments they sought, that he, too, would help them filibuster his own bill before it proceeded to a final vote, according to one of the officials. One Senate Democratic aide, also speaking on condition of anonymity, dismissed the moves from Republicans, saying no serious offer nor efforts at bipartisan talks had been made by GOP senators.


  “We’re literally arguing about whether to stop arguing about whether to start arguing about something else,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning. “Nobody thought the first offer from the Republican side was going to be the final product that traveled out of the Senate.”


  The Senate GOP plan incorporates a number of Democratic proposals, such as legislation to make lynching a federal hate crime and a national policing commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the U.S. criminal justice system.


  It also withholds federal grants to state and local law enforcement agencies that do not proactively bar the practice of chokeholds. It also calls on states and localities to report to the Justice Department when “no-knock warrants” are used, and it would punish those that do not do so, by withholding federal funding.


  On one major point of dissension between the parties, the Republican bill leaves intact the “qualified immunity” standard that Democrats want to erode, making it easier for law enforcement officials to be sued for misconduct.


  In its veto threat, the Trump administration called the Democratic legislation an “overbroad bill” that “would deter good people from pursuing careers in law enforcement, weaken the ability of law enforcement agencies to reduce crime and keep our communities safe, and fail to bring law enforcement and the communities they serve closer together.”


  Despite the vote, McConnell left open the possibility of taking procedural steps to tee it up again in the future. Republicans later noted that Democrats can exert significant influence on the progress of the bill, because it would require 60 votes not just to start work on the legislation but also, separately, to move it to a final passage vote.

1 Around Lakeland, at Saddle Creek the bass bite has been a little slow. Crankbaits in deeper water have been getting the best bite. Good numbers of big bluegill haven been caught on crickets, red worms and wigglers. A few shellcracker have been caught, but not as many. A lot of catfish are coming in on liver and cut shiners. Around town, Lake Bonny has been good for bass around deep water, offshore grass. Lake Crago is producing bass offshore on crankbaits. Lakes Parker and Hollingsworth have been good for bluegill on crickets in the pads, reports Jacob Eaton at Phillips Bait and Tackle (863-666-2248).


   


  2 At Auburndale, Lake Juliana has been good for schoolie bass up to 4 pounds on topwater frogs early and dark color Senkos later in the day. Julianna also has a good bluegill bite and plenty of bowfin. Around Lake Alfred, lakes Haines, Rochelle and Alfred are all producing bass up to 8 pounds, but Rochelle is producing better numbers of big fish. Topwater frogs fished early along with Senkos and trick worms later, are producing. The bluegill bite is good. Running water in lakes Haines and Rochelle is producing the best bite. There's also still some specks biting, reports Ron Schelfo at Ron's Tackle Box (863-956-4990).


   


  3 At Winter Haven, bass action has been good in deeper water around drop- off's using 10-inch plastic worms. Working the heavy cover along the shorelines early in the morning with crankbaits and spinners is also producing. Lakes Hartridge, Summit and Winterset have had notable catches. Bluegill and shellcracker are biting good on crickets and red worms in the pads at lakes Hartridge and Lulu, reports Jeremy Cooley of Caribbean Bay Bait & Tackle (863-292-9755).


   


  4 At Lake Hamilton, on the Hamilton Chain, bass have been caught early on the edges of the grass. Later on, deeper water offshore, is best. The big lake is producing the best numbers and the bite is picking up around the moving water. Some bluegill are biting around the lily pads and Kissimmee grass on crickets and red worms at all three lakes, reports Mickey Ingram at Hoppy's Marine (863-439-7616).


   


  5 At Lake Marion near Haines City, "decent numbers of bluegill are biting and there's a lot of beds, but the fish are scattered around the lake," reports Ingram. The panfish bite has come around. Regular anglers are scouting out their favorite spots and staying in them all day. reports Eileen O' Leary at Bannon's Fish Camp (863-422-1223).


   


  6 At Lake Pierce, bass are biting topwaters along the grassy shorelines early. The fish attractors are producing during the day on crankbaits and dark color plastic worms.

There's been good numbers, up to 25 fish a trip, per boat with slightly better numbers of shellcracker, reports Jennings Resort (863-439-3811).


   


  7 At Lake Hatchineha, Carolina rigged plastic worms and rattling crankbaits such as a Jackall TN70 in threadfin color are producing around moving water. A few bluegill have been caught on red worms, reports Chuck Metheney at Bridgemaster Fishing Products (863-676-1009).


   


  8 At Lake Toho, bass fishing is picking up on live shiners for the guides. The artificial bite is still best in 6 to 8 feet of water around hydrilla and submerged vegetation. Black and blue or junebug color plastic worms have been the most productive. Bluegill are biting on the big flat off Marker 26, reports Mark Detweiler at Big Toho Marina (407-846-2124).


   


  9 At Lake Kissimmee, recent rains are producing a decent bass bite on Carolina rigged plastic worms and crankbaits around areas with moving water. For the panfish, there's still decent action for bluegill on red worms and some good size specks have been caught on the offshore brush piles, reports Chuck Metheney at Bridgemaster Fishing Products (863-676-1009).


   


  10 At Lake Walk-in-the-Water, bass have been active in the moving water around the creeks. The Kissimmee grass is also producing while using spinnerbaits. The new, Old School Baits Mini A spinnerbait, by Lee Sisson, a former lure designer for Bagley Baits, has been especially productive, reports Metheney. Specks have been caught while drifting minnows in about six feet of water. Bluegill are biting good in the mouths of the canals on the east side, reports Jim Childress of Big Bass Bait & Tackle (352-207-7520).


   


  11 At Crooked Lake at Babson Park, good numbers of good size shellcracker are biting on red worms along the north shoreline across from Wirt's Point during the early morning. The bass bite was tough this week. It was mostly schoolies along the north shore by the college and some of the docks, reports Cindy Ritchison at Bob's Landing (863-638-1912).


   


  12 At Frostproof, for the bass, Lake Reedy is producing on shiners in water 5 to 6 feet deep. Rat-L-Traps and crankbaits are also producing along the edges of the grass.

Working the crankbaits just off the deeper hydrilla and cattail lined banks is getting the best bite. The worms are best fished in water 10 to 14 feet deep. Anglers reported the scent of bluegill beds this past weekend on the new moon.

Dak Prescott plans to be at training camp with the Dallas Cowboys, if and when it starts, on the richest one-year contract in franchise history.


   


  There is also still time to work out a long-term deal for the star quarterback.


   


  Prescott signed his $31.4 million tender under the franchise tag Monday. That comes just over three weeks before the July 15 deadline to agree on a long- term deal.


   


  By signing the offer under the franchise tag, Prescott is obligated to report for all team activities or risk being fined. He didn't participate in the club's virtual offseason program while unsigned.


   


  Prescott played the final year of his rookie contract on a $2 million salary. He was the 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year while leading the Cowboys to the NFC's top seed in the playoffs and won his first postseason game two years later.


   


  There has never been a question of whether Prescott is the franchise quarterback in Dallas. Owner Jerry Jones has repeatedly made that clear as the sides have spent more than a year trying to agree on a long-term contract.


   


  Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence has the highest per-year average in Dallas history at $21 million. The two-time Pro Bowler signed a $105 million, five- year deal last year.


   


  Prescott has started every game of his career after replacing the injured Tony Romo during the 2016 preseason. He led a franchise-record 11-game winning streak during the regular season before Dallas lost to Green Bay in the divisional round.


   


  The Cowboys missed the playoffs in Prescott's second year when fellow rookie sensation Ezekiel Elliott was suspended six games. With his running back in the fold for a full season in 2018, Prescott led Dallas to another NFC East title and a wild-card win over Seattle before losing to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round.


   


  The two-time Pro Bowler started his rookie season third on the depth chart after getting drafted in the fourth round out of Mississippi State. He moved up a spot when Kellen Moore was injured in training camp, and took over as the starter after Romo injured his back in a preseason game. Romo never got his job back.


   


  Despite missing the playoffs again last season, Prescott had career bests with 4,902 yards passing and 30 touchdowns.


   


  The Cowboys didn't renew coach Jason Garrett's contract after a season that fell far short of expectations and hired Mike McCarthy. The former Green Bay coach won a Super Bowl with Aaron Rogers a decade ago.

WINTER HAVEN -- Winter Haven's first Black firefighter, Arnold Ray Oates Sr., died Monday at age 83 after a lengthy battle with cancer.


   


  Oates will be remembered for a staunch work ethic and his good name, said his son, 56-year-old Arnold Oates Jr.


   


  "He had that name recognition," Oates Jr. said.


   


  Joining the fire department as a volunteer in 1967, Oates became a full-time firefighter in 1971 and later was promoted to the position of firefighter engineer.


   


  The struggle as the first Black firefighter was real, according to his son.


   


  "We had to deal with that as kids," he said. "We were still not accepted as Black people."


   


  Oates Jr. said his dad was an "ice breaker" who was a "well rounded, sweet guy," quickly gaining popularity at the fire department for his cooking skills.


   


  "My dad could throw down," he said. "People just welcomed him for the type of person he was. If he got mad with people, he did not show it."


   


  And Oates was brave, said his son, who joined his dad in "ride-alongs" on some of the fire calls.


   


  "To see my dad jump off that truck and run into a burning building, that was scary. He was the first one to go," Oates Jr. said. "He was not afraid."


   


  Oates Jr. said that although his dad worked at the fire department, times were still hard, as Oates tried to make ends meet.


   


  The Oates children would join their father picking fruit in the groves.


   


  "We did what we had to do. That was another way of teaching us to go out to be go-getters and not afraid to work," he said.


   


  Two things Oates was afraid of, however, were snakes and lightning, said his son.


   


  Recalling the day he brought a fake snake home and left it in the house, Oates Jr. said the children came running in to see their dad beating the snake with a broom.


   


  "If he didn't almost scare me that day," Oates Jr. said, adding that his dad said, "don't you ever bring no snake in my house."


   


  Oates Jr. noted he was proud of his father for raising them and being devoted to his mother, Ossie.


   


  2019 Pioneer Luncheon honor


   


  Years after his retirement in 1992 with nearly 30 years of fire service, Oates was honored at the Polk County Historical Association 2019 Pioneer Luncheon.


   


  Oates was interviewed by Myrtice Young of the Polk Historical Association on PGTV as one of the pioneers of Pughsville, which was among the oldest and well-known Black communities in Winter Haven.


   


  CLICK HERE TO SEE ARNOLD RAY OATES SR. INTERVIEW


   


  Oates said he was born in Indianapolis and he and his mother, Fannie Walker, moved to her home state of Florida when he was about 7.


   


  At first, they lived with family in Florence Villa, but later moved to Pughsville.


   


  That was in 1944.


   


  He met his wife, Ossie Mae Oates, in Pughsville as the two grew up together. In 1961 they were married at a reverend's house in Florence Villa. They were married 44 years until she passed away. The couple raised eight children.


   


  He said he picked fruit, loaded fruit, hauled fruit and did odd jobs.


   


  Pughsville helped single parents raise their children, he said.


   


  "The whole community was your parent," Oates said, noting that if kids got in trouble and someone in the community got wind of it, they got one "whipping" from that person, "and when you got home, you got another whipping."


   


  As a child, he was fond of shooting marbles, playing Cowboys and Indians, Tarzan, Hide and Seek, and other games.


   


  With his mother working long hours, he was responsible for all the washing, mopping and housecleaning.


   


  "And I would let no kid in my house until Mama got home," he said.


   


  As a teenager, he was a migrant worker, and traveled north to Georgia to help in peach orchards.


   


  In his time at Winter Haven Fire Department, Oates said he took the Lieutenant test and passed it. Not long after he was given rank, he said that he and others with similar rank were told to start doing graphing drawings of businesses and buildings downtown.


   


  Although he attended Jewett High School, he attained his GED but didn't have any training on how to do the graph drawings, he told Young. That's when he said he almost quit the fire department. Shortly after, he was returned to engineer duty, he said.


   


  Honored by community


   


  Patricia Smithsfield, who also grew up in Pughsville, said Oates was her cousin.


   


  Smithsfield said he doubled as an auxiliary policeman and she remembers when Winter Haven Public Safety Chief Charlie Bird and the Winter Haven Fire Department, along with city officials and other county dignitaries, presented a coin to Oates at the Pioneer Luncheon held at the Bartow Civic Center in June 2019.


   


  She said he woke up at 5 a.m. that day to get dressed for the occasion.


   


  "He was pumped and ready," she said. "He never thought his job or his status mattered, but it did; he [established] a legacy."


   


  She said he endured racism and some hatred.


   


  "But he kept going. He worked for 30 years in that post, and he was very humble," she said. "To him, it meant a lot.


   


  "His eyes lit up like a kid in a candy store when Chief Bird gave him one of the coins from the city. That made him feel so wonderful."


   


  Upon receiving the news of his death, Bird spoke highly of Oates.


   


  "Mr. Oates truly was a pioneer and a dedicated servant to the citizens of Winter Haven and Polk County," Bird said in an email to The Ledger. "He was a good and kind man to whom I was honored to present our Public Safety Coin at the June luncheon to honor his service and dedication to our community. Mr. Oates made an imprint on our community and in our hearts that will forever live on."


   


  Winter Haven City Commissioner and Mayor Pro-Tem Nat Birdsong said he had known Oates since 2002 when he first became a city commissioner.


   


  "He was extremely hard working," Birdsong said, adding Oates was a "model citizen" for the community.


   


  "My impression for him was that as the first minority Black African American in the fire department, he didn't look at that as something that made him special. He was really a hard worker, a team player," he said.


   


  After Oates retired, he had a number of business endeavors, and worked for CSX in Winter Haven for about 10 years, transporting railroad crews back and forth to Mulberry and Arcadia.


   


  Gause Funeral Home in Bartow is handling funeral arrangements. The family will be announcing the service at a later date.

  In the view of many, the outcome left losers on both sides. MLB already has experienced four straight seasons of declining average attendance.


  “In my opinion, it’s a damn shame that the ramifications of this are going to be felt for a long time,” said Cincinnati catcher Tucker Barnhart, the Reds’ player representative. “I grew up a baseball fan, I’m a baseball fan first, and I think it sucks that it’s had to go on the way that it is. But I hope that getting out and playing will kind of mask some of the bruises that the game as a whole has taken over the last few months.”


  MLB intends to start without fans in ballparks, even in places where government and medical officials allow some spectators.


  “I think we need to get on the ground running and get comfortable that we can play games in empty stadiums safely before we move forward fans,” Manfred said. “My patience in that regard is in part based on the fact that there are so many different situations. Some places there looks like there’s no prospect, other places they’re more aggressive. I think we need to be patient and even where we have the option, we need to make sure that we know exactly what we’re doing before we jump into it.”


  Owners decided to go ahead with a season despite the threat of a grievance from the union, which has claimed MLB did not adhere to provisions in the March 26 agreement requiring the longest schedule economically feasible. That deal also included additional provisions such fans being allowed into all 30 ballparks and no relevant travel restrictions.

Madsen left Marina del Rey in a 20-foot rowboat in April, according to the Press-Telegram, intent on reaching the Hawaii Yacht Club in Honolulu within four months. She was about halfway through her journey when Deb Madsen lost touch with her on Sunday, she said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.


  Injured in the military in her 20s, Angela Madsen had awakened from a botched back surgery to find herself paralyzed, according to a biography on Row of Life, a rowing organization. Undeterred from physical activity, the lifelong athlete went on to earn bronze medals in rowing and shot-put in the Paralympics.


  From there she earned six Guinness world records in ocean rowing, becoming a leader in the rowing world, Row of Life said.


  Her attempt to cross the Pacific would have taken her 2,500 miles. She brought all her own food, rendered ocean water drinkable via a desalinator, and rowed for 12 of every 24 hours, the biography said.


  She was declared dead by the Coast Guard at 11 p.m. PST on Monday, wrote Deb Madsen and Soraya Simi, who was making a documentary about the rowing pro, in a statement on Row of Life.


  Angela Madsen had been at sea “completely alone” for 60 days, the pair said, having rowed 1,114 nautical miles from Los Angeles. She was 1,275 nautical miles from Honolulu.


  “Angela was a warrior, as fierce as they come,” Deb Madsen and Simi wrote. She had overcome “unbelievable hardship” to champion the path she had envisioned since she was a child.


  Deb Madsen had last heard from her wife on Saturday, when she texted saying she was going into the water to do some maintenance. When Deb did not hear from her on Sunday, she alerted the Coast Guard, who found her.

Each year, over 100,000 infants are born in New York City, where the pandemic has now reshaped the experience of childbirth. The virus has added more tension into what is an already uncertain process, as women are entering hospitals that have been overrun by a disease that has killed nearly 22,000 in the city and more than 120,000 nationwide.


  Most women, like Arian, are immediately tested for COVID-19 when they enter maternity wards; then they may spend hours waiting for the result. In many cases, they go through labor in a mask. Some pregnant women with the virus have reported feeling shunned by staff members who they believe are fearful of contracting the illness.


  Jesse Pournaras, a New York City-based doula, has tracked hospital policies in the city during the crisis and says they have been difficult to determine and “extraordinarily variable,” and have contributed to New Yorkers’ anxiety.


  “People are confused and they’re upset, and they’re going into the labor and delivery units in a state of fight or flight,” Pournaras said.


  During the pandemic, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has tried to shape guidelines for childbirth at hospitals, but his executive orders on the subject created confusion because facilities interpreted them differently. Critics have also said it felt like New York slid back to a time when pregnant women had less input over their care.


  New York City’s Department of Health said that to protect health workers and patients, it was providing guidance to hospitals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the CDC advises each facility to adopt policies based on rates of community transmission, as well as on space and staffing needs.


  In late March, after public outcry, Cuomo clarified a new rule that limited visitations at health care facilities so that hospitals would not mistakenly use it to ban one support person from labor and delivery wards. In April, under another order, he clarified that hospitals are required to allow partners and doulas to stay with most patients through labor, delivery and postpartum care.


  His office convened a COVID-19 Maternity Task Force that released recommendations in April for birthing facilities, which included universal testing for patients and partners, after a study in New York City found that nearly 14% of pregnant women who tested positive for the virus were asymptomatic.

  While SDOT said the project wasn’t canceled, some wonder whether the latest delay could spell death for the project — and even Seattle’s other streetcar lines.


  Both the First Hill and South Lake Union lines operate at a deficit and the First Hill line gets money from Sound Transit that is set to expire in 2023. The new addition was expected to significantly increase ridership to the streetcar system.


  “Without that central piece, there will be pressure to kill those [other streetcar lines] too,” said Doug Trumm, executive director at The Urbanist, which has supported the new streetcar.


  Delaying "may end up costing us more money down the road if we do plan to build the [streetcar] and we really think Seattle should do that," Trumm said.


  At last estimate, the streetcar was expected to cost $286 million, including about $78 million in utility work, and faced a combined $88 million shortfall.

Timing is everything, which may leave the National Basketball Association with nothing.


   


  It seems only a matter of time now until the NBA cancels its plan to resume its season and then play its entire postseason in a Disney World bubble. It doesn't make sense to fly into the epicenter of a pandemic. Baseball, hockey, soccer and football teams have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks in Florida and have altered training plans accordingly.


   


  Moving to Plan B -- if there is one -- would be a more drastic step for the NBA, which may explain the league's hesitancy to make an announcement. Several veteran players have already decided not to participate, and there will be more. Some of the Toronto Raptors are training together in Fort Myers, preparing for a dubious move to Disney in two weeks.


   


  The Disney plan, born out of desperation, would have been inconceivable six months ago. It was innovative and ambitious and seemed worth a try until Gov. Ron DeSantis monkeyed it up.


   


  Yes, if we are looking for someone to blame for this disaster, it has to start there, and then we have to look in the mirror. This didn't have to happen this way. We have been negligent, and there are consequences.


   


  DeSantis has been conspicuously resistant to proven policies that would have kept the spread of COVID-19 to more manageable levels. As recently as last week, he was insisting that the recent surge in cases was due only to increased testing.


   


  DeSantis started to change his mind over the weekend when someone finally got through to him that young and middle-aged people were also getting infected at an alarming rate. This was a week after the governor of Texas had observed that the majority of people testing positive "in certain counties" was below the age of 30.


   


  A lot of us old folks understood that DeSantis had written us off, had accepted us as collateral damage in his war to get the economy back on its feet. But when the cases of 20- to 40-year-old Floridians began to surge, that's when it occurred to the governor that crowded bars, restaurants, stores, gyms and beaches might not be such a good idea yet. Maybe people should start wearing masks and maintaining social distances like they do almost everywhere else.


   


  "We're seeing it spread in 20- and 30-year-olds faster than we would like to see," DeSantis told the Orlando Sentinel, "so we really want to send a message of doubling down on what we've been preaching since the start in terms of social distancing."


   


  Hey thanks, gov, except that you really haven't been preaching that from the start, or even the middle. Quite the contrary. You were among the first to suggest that the cure (masks, social distancing, partial shutdowns) might be worse than the disease. Then, contradicting the assessments of scientists, doctors and other experts, you misled led us into believing that the viral surge was past its peak, that the worst was over, so we could come out and play. We believed you because we wanted to, and now we're paying the price.


   


  So is the NBA, which has nowhere else to go after putting all of its eggs in a Florida basket. The league's best option now might be to call off the rest of the season and come up with a realistic plan for a relatively normal 2020-21 season. The same may be true for Major League Baseball, which is still a long way from starting even a portion of a season.


   


  When the pandemic hit us in mid-March, we assumed it would be an inconvenience for a week or two. The idea that team sports played in front of large crowds might not be possible for several months, or perhaps all year, was unthinkable. But we've never had a real lockdown in Florida, the kind they have had in other states and countries, where "spike" and "hot spot" and "epicenter" aren't so much a part of the vocabulary these days.


   


  We can't have a lockdown here. People won't do it. They figure the virus is mostly in nursing homes and prisons, so they don't have to look at it or think much about it.


   


  An epidemiologist said on television recently that a strict lockdown of six weeks could have put the serious danger posed by the coronavirus in the past. I have no way of knowing whether his assessment was accurate, but let's say he was exaggerating and it would have taken 12 weeks, or even 15 weeks.


   


  That's where we are now, 15 weeks from the middle of March. Masks are now mandatory in public settings in Orlando, Tampa and Miami, but I don't see many people wearing them in Polk County.


   


  Football season is next.

NEW YORK -- From Macy's "Miracle on 34th Street" store to the World Trade Center's office towers, New York City hits a key point Monday in trying to rebound from the nation's deadliest coronavirus outbreak.
   
 For the first time in three months, New Yorkers will be able to dine out, though only at outdoor tables. Shoppers can once again browse in the city's destination stores. Shaggy heads can get haircuts. Cooped-up kids can finally climb playground monkey bars instead of apartment walls. Office workers can return to their desks, though many won't yet.
   
 Larry Silverstein, for one, can't wait.
   
 The 89-year-old World Trade Center developer is going to work at his office there Monday, along with up to a third of Silverstein Properties' staff. The firm is staggering schedules so employees can keep their distance and they'll have to wear masks in the 7 World Trade Center lobby. Footprints mark where to stand in elevators now limited to about a quarter their usual capacity.
   
 To Silverstein, returning to office life and in-person teamwork brings "a joy, a fulfillment, such a sense of being able to function." He doesn't buy into arguments that the pandemic doesn't bode well for office work or New York City.
   
 "I went through 9/11. I remember people telling me we were never going to be able to get people to come back to lower Manhattan," said Silverstein, who leased the twin towers six weeks before the 2001 terror attacks destroyed them. "Never bet against New York, because New York always comes back, bigger and better than ever before."
   
 But some New Yorkers are apprehensive.
   
 Alex Michaels may return soon to a retail job. He agrees it's important to revive the economy, but he worries about potential coronavirus exposure from working with the public, even with new safety measures.
   
 "Something's got to give. I get that," said Michaels, 30, but there could be "a high price to pay."
   
 Eve Gonzalez, a food industry worker whose job hasn't yet resumed, feels it's too soon to relax restrictions.
   
 "I'm dying to go out, but people's health is more important," said Gonzalez, 27.
   
 The virus has been blamed for over 22,000 New York City deaths. The death toll has been in single digits in recent days. Infections are down, but between 200 and 400 people have still been testing positive for the virus each day over the past two weeks, according to city data.
   
 The city estimates 150,000 to 300,000 additional workers will return to their jobs Monday, two weeks after reopening began with construction, curbside- pickup retail, wholesaling and manufacturing.
   
 Monday marks just the second of four reopening phases, but Mayor Bill de Blasio sees it as "the single biggest piece of our economy," particularly for a restaurant industry he called "quintessential to New York City."
   
 After three months of struggling to get by on takeout and delivery, Melba Wilson is exuberant about introducing appropriately spaced sidewalk tables outside Melba's, her Harlem restaurant.
   
 "This is definitely the infusion that we so greatly needed. ... It's been very grim," and not just financially, said Wilson, president of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, an industry group. "We talk about being physically distant, which is important, but being socially active is important, as well."
   
 Retailers also hope for a boost once customers can wander aisles and try on clothes, with new virus-safety measures.
   
 At Macy's famous flagship store, makeup testing is temporarily banned. Clothes left in fitting rooms won't go back on the rack for 24 hours. Workers will undergo temperature checks. Mask-wearing shoppers will find plastic dividers at cash registers.
   
 "We want both customers and colleagues to be comfortable and to feel that their safety and health is our top priority," said division Vice President Kathy Hilt.
   
 Saks Fifth Avenue plans to reopen Wednesday, with 100 new hand-sanitizer stations and escalator handrails newly outfitted with ultraviolet-light disinfection, among other changes.
   
 Shuttered offices also can reopen Monday, with various new rules. But some of the city's biggest corporate employers are sticking with largely remote work for now.
   
 Only about 5% of Citi's 13,300 New York City employees are expected back at the bank's offices on July 1. JPMorgan Chase hasn't set a date yet for returning to its New York offices; Wells Fargo's time frame is July 31 or later. Pharmaceutical company Pfizer is extending remote working at least until the as-yet-undetermined date for city's next reopening phase.
   
 With work-from-home arrangements now established and employees concerned about offices, public-transit commutes and child care, many white-collar companies are "moving with caution and safety," says Bhushan Sethi, a PwC partner specializing in workplace strategies. The consulting and accounting firm plans to reopen its own New York offices in September.
   
 As New York reopens, retail worker William Rodgers is figuring out his next steps.
   
 The last three months have not been easy, but "a lot of us have gotten time to reflect on our own lives," said Rodgers, 29. "That's one blessing."

The softball team that includes two-time Olympic gold medalist Cat Osterman has postponed its scheduled games in Viera, Fla., after breaking ties with its previous sponsor, the Montgomery County-based Scrap Yard Dawgs.      Team members said they would no longer represent Scrap Yard on Monday night after the team's general manager posted a photo of them on Twitter, standing during the National Anthem, that Osterman said "hijacked" them into the ongoing debate over National Anthem protests by athletes in support of racial equality and social justice.      The teams were scheduled to play games Wednesday night and through the weekend, but Florida-based USSSA Pride said that games would not be played while the former Scrap Yard players determine how to reorganize.      They are supporting us in our stance right now as we organize ourselves," Osterman said in a text message.      The tweet that prompted players to break away from Scrap Yard was written by Connie May, Scrap Yard's general manager, and said, "Hey @realDonaldTrump Pro Fastpitch being played live @usssaspacecoast @USSSAPride Everyone respecting the FLAG!"      "The GM tried to defend her tweet by saying it came from a good place in her heart and that she was proud of us taking the field and being able to unite, so to speak," Osterman said Tuesday.      "This team is very united. We were proud to take the field, and it would have been a platform for showing that sports can continue. However, it was hijacked by being political."      The former Scrap Yard team includes 11 members of the USA Softball team that will compete in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The team was scheduled to play 22 games in Conroe and in Florida over the next month.

  "The BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz AG are both working separately on current generations for highly-automated driving and have achieved major progress in this field in the past," Daimler said in a statement. "However, the BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz AG were unable to hold detailed expert discussions and talk to suppliers about technology roadmaps until the contract was signed last year. In these talks - and after extensive review - both sides concluded that, in view of the expense involved in creating a shared technology platform, as well as current business and economic conditions, the timing is not right for successful implementation of the cooperation."

McDowell’s caddie, Ken Comboy, tested positive but did not travel to Connecticut after showing symptoms over the weekend. McDowell played a practice round Tuesday with the Koepka brothers. Although they tested negative, they withdrew “out of an abundance of caution.”


  “I haven’t tested positive for COVID-19, but as I’ve said all along, I’m taking this very seriously,” Koepka said in a statement. “I don’t want to do anything that might jeopardize the health of any player in the field or his ability to compete.”


  Koepka told GolfWeek that he, caddie Ricky Elliot and coach Claude Harmon III each tested negative for COVID-19 on Monday. The three took another test on Tuesday after a practice round, and while Koepka and Harmon III tested negative, Elliot tested positive.


  Monahan said the Tour is continuing to refine its health and safety plan, confident the tournament could continue this week and that they’d play in front of fans by mid-July. Among other modifications, the Tour will now add additional testing upon arrival to new markets, player instructors will be included in the testing bubble, which previously just included players and caddies. The Tour will also now have a fitness trailer on site so golfers aren’t forced to use public gyms.


  There is no set number of positive tests that would lead to golf shutting down, however.


  “We feel like we’re on a path that’s going to allow us to continue to sustain our return to golf,” Monahan said. “But rest assured, there won’t be many sleepless nights. When you’re working in a world of uncertainty, these are the things you worry about.”


  Monahan also confirmed that if golfers do not follow the Tour's health and safety protocols, they will face "serious repercussions," but did not specify what that entailed.  

  “Over the first couple of weeks, we’ve seen some instances where we’ve gotten a little bit lax or away from protocol,” Monahan said. “Full disclosure, I’ve done it myself.”

  “I am not hitting the panic button,” Hamrick said.


  In light of events around the country and a developing issue at West Virginia University, Hamrick and other university officials also provided the committee with details of how the department is handling social justice with student- athletes.


  The athletic department reached out to Maurice Cooley, MU Vice President of Student Affairs, for advice on how the staff and athletes could express their views and concerns surrounding current issues, from the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests to social justice in the NFL. Cooley facilitated a discussion among staff and some of the leaders among the athletes, including football quarterback Isaiah Green and running back Brenden Knox.


  The idea for the football team to kneel for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in honor of George Floyd’s life came from the meetings. Cooley said he was impressed with the maturity and rational thinking displayed by the athletes, who came up with several more ideas, including more scholarships for black students, organizing a voter registration drive in the fall and visiting schools in the area to talk about social and racial justice.


  Green and Knox are also designing a T-shirt to raise money for local kids, Cooley said.


  Cooley said ensuring avenues of communication were open and allowing athletes to speak freely on how they feel about current events is how the team can maintain unity.

That might explain why a team member of NASCAR’s only Black driver took it as a noose in the first place – Wallace has been a beacon of praise and criticism since he first asked NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag, another symbol that hatred has festered. It was one person looking out for the benefit of another, the way it should be.


  On Monday, before the GEICO 500, fellow racers pushed Wallace’s car to the starting line as a display of unity, circling around him. It was a collective moment for a sport that roughly two months ago suspended one of its rising stars, Kyle Larson, after he blurted out a racial slur during a iRacing event.


  That march, a flash point of progress, can be the kindling for change, said Omar Ali, dean of the Lloyd International Honors College at UNCG.


  “All we can do, and as an educator all I can do, is create space after space for people to step in and learn how to have new kinds of conversations where we’re not simply pointing fingers but relating to the best in others,” Ali said. “And have it be grounded in history.


  “. . . You can’t begin to appreciate the pain that that causes when people are presented that or that appears in your garage or whatever. This is an appeal to learn history, to also be co-producers in history, with a posture that’s radically inclusive.”


  The history for this country is complex, at times ugly. A Civil War hero can be lauded while looking over his slave-trading past. Statues still stand today for people who were particularly brutal to their fellow man.


  But it’s also peppered with progressive steps that finally break down old and flawed ideals. The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people remind us we still have a way to go.


  Wallace brought that ongoing conversation to the sports world, and it will continue to grow as our professional leagues return. Ali, a Columbia Ph.D. grad, said it’s pivotal that these tough conversations are now more frequently born on the playing field. And the tough discussions athletes will continue to bring forward will be more than worthwhile to our society.


  “There’s a long history of issues of racism in the sports world, and I think it offers a new vista and new conversations,” Ali said. “I think it’s going to be really, really hard emotionally.


  “If you want to develop, you have to let people say how they’re doing, (and) what they’re thinking because people are shutting each other down and people are feeling like they have to come out and say the definitive statement against racism. And that’s fine, but to me the more important work is creating conversations and not just issuing statements.

BOISE, Idaho -- The case of two kids who were missing for months before they were found dead in rural Idaho has taken another bizarre twist, with new court documents alleging that their mother believed they were zombies and that she was on a mission to rid the world of such creatures.


   


  Police discovered the remains of 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and her 7-year-old brother, Joshua "JJ" Vallow, on June 9 at property belonging to their mother's new husband. The case gained attention for the couple's doomsday beliefs and the mysterious deaths of their former spouses, and court documents released late last week detail more about the strange worldview that detectives think may have influenced Lori Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell.


   


  So far, no one has been charged with killing the kids, who had not been seen since September, but the Daybells are both behind bars.


   


  Lori Daybell's attorney has indicated that she intends to defend herself against charges of child abandonment and obstructing an investigation. Chad Daybell has pleaded not guilty to destroying or concealing the children's bodies.


   


  Lori Daybell's longtime best friend, Melanie Gibb, has been cooperating with authorities for months, according to the documents written by Rexburg police Lt. Ron Ball. Gibb is the last known person to have seen JJ alive, according to police, when she was visiting Lori Daybell at her apartment in the small Idaho town last September.


   


  "Gibb reports that when she arrived in Rexburg, Lori Vallow informed her that JJ Vallow had become a 'zombie,'" Ball wrote. "Gibb further reports that the term 'zombie' refers to an individual whose mortal spirit has left their body and that their body is now the host of another spirit. The new spirit in a 'zombie' is always considered a 'dark spirit.'"


   


  It wasn't the first time Gibb said she heard her friend talk about zombies, according to the statement. Gibb said Lori Daybell had called Tylee a zombie in spring 2019 when the teen didn't want to baby-sit her little brother and that Lori Daybell had first learned the concept from Chad Daybell at the start of that year.


   


  Gibb said the couple believed that when a zombie takes over a person's body, "the person's true spirit goes into 'limbo' and is stuck there until the host body is physically killed," the court document said. "As such, death of the physical body is seen as the mechanism by which the body's original spirit can be released from limbo."


   


  Gibb also said the couple believed they were spiritual leaders.


   


  "She was told by Chad Daybell and Lori Vallow that they held the religious belief that they were a part of the 'Church of the Firstborn' and that their mission in that Church was to lead the '144,000' mentioned in the Book of Revelation. They also stated their mission was to rid the world of 'zombies,'" according to the police document.


   


  Hints of strange, doomsday beliefs have surrounded the complex case since it began last year.


   


  It started last summer with Lori Daybell's brother shooting and killing her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in suburban Phoenix in what he asserted was self-defense. Vallow was seeking a divorce, saying Lori believed she had become a god-like figure who was responsible for ushering in the biblical end times. Her brother, Alex Cox, died in December of an apparent blood clot in his lung.


   


  Shortly after Vallow's death, Lori and the children moved to Idaho, where Chad Daybell lived. He ran a small publishing company, putting out many fiction books he wrote about apocalyptic scenarios loosely based on the theology of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He also recorded podcasts about preparing for biblical end times, and friends said he claimed to be able to receive visions from "beyond the veil."


   


  He was married to Tammy Daybell, who died last October of what her obituary said were natural causes. Authorities grew suspicious when he married Lori just two weeks later, and they had Tammy Daybell's body exhumed in December. The results of that autopsy have not been released.


   


  Police began searching for Tylee and JJ in November after relatives raised concerns. Police say the Daybells lied to investigators about the children's whereabouts before quietly leaving Idaho. They were found in Hawaii months later.


   


  Tylee was last seen Sept. 8, when she went to Yellowstone National Park with her mom, her brother and Cox, court documents say.


   


  It's not clear what happened to her, but police say the next day, Cox's cellphone data shows he made a trip to Chad Daybell's property and was near where the children's bodies were found. Also on Sept. 9, investigators say Chad Daybell texted Tammy, reportedly telling her that he decided to burn some plants and also had shot a raccoon, which he buried in an area of the property where the family had previously buried dead pets, according to the court documents.


   


  The detective said in the documents that he was suspicious because raccoons are normally nocturnal and the text said the animal had been shot during the day.


   


  Gibb visited Lori Daybell a couple of weeks later. Gibb said she was told Tylee was attending school at a nearby college, though investigators later found the teen had never been enrolled. Gibb also said JJ's behavior appeared to be typical, despite his mother claiming he was acting strangely.


   


  The last time Gibb saw JJ was Sept. 22 at Lori Daybell's apartment. Cox left with his nephew for his apartment nearby, Gibb told police, and when they returned, JJ appeared to be asleep, with his head on Cox's shoulder.


   


  The next morning, Gibb said JJ was gone and Lori said Cox had taken him for a while, according to the document.


   


  An analysis of Alex Cox's cellphone records that day show that his phone pinged at locations on Chad Daybell's property where the children's remains were later found, police said.


   


  It was those cellphone records that led police to the bodies, according to the court documents. Police didn't immediately respond to requests for comment about Cox's possible involvement in the children's deaths.

  MONTPELIER — Rather than go on furlough and be paid to stay at home, Michelle Amaral made a seamless transition from parking attendant to sanitation specialist in a way that turned the heads of some of her municipal co-workers.


  How do we know?


  Because Amaral received multiple nominations on her way to being named Wednesday night as the May recipient of Montpelier’s “Above and Beyond” award.


  The monthly employee recognition award, which comes with a tip of the cap from the City Council and a small bonus, was started late last year and Amaral got the nod last month thanks to her “… positive attitude in the face of change, her work ethic and her ability to seek out opportunities to assist others.”


  That’s high praise for a woman who can’t return to her regular job until the city decides to start charging for parking again. Instead of going on voluntary furlough Amaral opted to help the city keep its facilities cleaned and sanitized at a time when that is an important function.


  By all accounts, Amaral didn’t just do it to keep punching the clock, she did it with an impressive level of dedication that deserves to be recognized and rewarded.

Oxygen can be delivered in two ways. Tanks contain nearly pure oxygen. For patients who need large volumes and help keeping the air sacs in their lungs open, tanks can deliver oxygen at high pressure through a mask strapped tightly over the nose and mouth.


  But tanks are heavy, must be refilled at central stations and delivered by truck, and pose some risk of explosion and fire. While many poor countries have plants making industrial-grade oxygen for construction jobs like welding, it cannot be used on patients because the tanks often contain rust or oily water that could lodge in the lungs, said Paul Molinaro, chief of operations support and logistics at the WHO.


  An alternative is an oxygen concentrator, which is usually the size of a suitcase or even a briefcase. Concentrators pull oxygen out of ambient air by forcing it under pressure through a “molecular sieve” filled with the mineral zeolite, which adsorbs nitrogen.


  Most concentrators cost only $1,000 to $2,000. They need electricity but can run on a generator or batteries, using about as much power as a small refrigerator.


  Typically concentrators can produce about 90% pure oxygen. They do not deliver it under pressure, but the thin tube through which the oxygen streams can be connected to a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, to enrich the air it blows into the lungs.


  ALIMA has started a campaign, “Oxygen for Africa,” to raise money to send about 500 concentrators to six poor countries, Jennifer Lazuta, a spokesperson, said.


  UNICEF has ordered about 16,000 concentrators for about 90 countries, but thus far has been able to deliver only about 700, said Jonathan Howard-Brand, an innovation specialist at UNICEF’s procurement center in Copenhagen.


  The WHO has ordered another 14,000, of which 2,000 have been delivered and 2,000 are in transit, Molinaro said.


  He and Howard-Brand described severe delivery problems created by the epidemic, including delays of up to five weeks. When possible, the aid agencies ship through the World Food Program, which has dozens of planes. But the concentrators must compete for space with shipments of food, personal protective gear and other lifesaving goods.


  Also, some countries are far from cargo hub cities, while others restrict all flights, even those containing aid, for fear of the virus being introduced.


  “We need more planes in the air,” Howard-Brand said.


  UNICEF is also buying tens of thousands of pulse oximeters, fingertip devices to measure blood-oxygen saturation.


  In deciding how much equipment to buy, the aid agencies are, to some extent, flying blind. As New York state learned when it was desperately collecting ventilators in March, how great the need will be is unpredictable.


  Younger COVID-19 patients and those without other health problems often survive without supplemental oxygen. Populations in Africa skew younger, because vaccination and anti-malaria campaigns over the past two decades have saved many children who otherwise would have died. Wide swaths of older Africans died of AIDS before HIV therapy became widely available in the mid-2000s.


  (It is still unclear whether being on HIV treatment increases risks of death from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But UNAIDS, the U.N. program fighting the disease, worries that lockdowns and border closings will disrupt supplies of HIV medicines, which would undoubtedly put HIV patients at high risk.)


  The agencies seek advice from other aid personnel in each country to estimate how much equipment is needed, Molinaro said. If he had more money and time, he added, he would concentrate on ways to increase supplies of tanked oxygen, which is dangerous to ship and so must be produced on site.

On Monday, a federal magistrate judge in Virginia agreed to let an attorney withdraw from representing Spencer in the lawsuit. The lawyer, John DiNucci, said Spencer owed him a significant amount of money in legal fees and hadn’t been cooperating adequately. The order leaves Spencer to defend himself against the lawsuit.
 Spencer’s ex-wife, Nina Koupriianova, filed the divorce proceedings in June 2018. They reached a settlement in December.
 Funda said she billed a total of nearly $86,000 in fees for her work on the divorce case since October 2018. She told the judge last month that Spencer had paid her more than $26,200 but refused to pay for the remaining $60,236.
 Spencer told the judge he could not afford a lawyer and thought the fees would be waived “if the responsible party is indigent.”
 “I can’t invent money out of thin air,” he said, according to the transcript of a May 19 hearing.
 Koupriianova had accused Spencer of physically, verbally and emotionally abusing her throughout their eight-year marriage. In a court filing, Spencer said he disputes “many of her assertions." He said in a text message Wednesday that he is grateful for Funda's help in “overturning” his ex-wife's "baseless accusations and insinuations against me,”
 “Funda was extremely helpful in securing my rights to co-parenting and joint custody. For that, I’m grateful," he texted Wednesday.
