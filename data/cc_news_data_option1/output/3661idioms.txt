While Iran’s stonewalling was concerning and it is critical that the nine- month delay between the request for access and the inspections do not become a precedent, the IAEA made clear that the materials and activities in question pre-date 2003 (when the IAEA assessed Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program) and are not currently ongoing. In this case, though the delay fed speculation that Iran had something to hide, it is unlikely that the results of the investigation will significantly alter the assessment of Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities acquired from its past program nor argue that they pose a near-term risk. However, Iran must comply with such requests down the road in a more timely fashion.

If didn't get to tune in, Liam has basically been living his best life on the app, chatting all kinds of stuff to excited fans, joining in a One Direction TikTok chain and generally giving the best content fans could ever want!
 Whilst chin wagging about the band, the 'Stack It Up' singer casually dropped in, "We have several 1D group chats."
 There was a time the boys insinuated they didn't talk too much, but after time has passed it's clear they're still incredibly close and genuinely good pals, much to the relief of every Directioner on planet earth.
 It was only recently he dropped by to chat on _Good Morning America_ where he revealed the boys had all privately messaged him sweet birthday messages which was the first hint they're still chatting to each other behind the scenes.
 Now, Liam's officially dropped the proof, in his new favourite past time, jumping on lives and spilling tea!
