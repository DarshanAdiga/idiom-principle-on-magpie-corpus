These two countries are among the ones with the strongest GDP in the world and house nearly a quarter of the global population. On the back of a thriving automotive industry, wherein passenger vehicles are high in demand, Asia Pacific is anticipated to remain the most lucrative region throughout the forecast period of the study. A number of manufacturers are also establishing their production plants in these two countries, which will further drive the APAC automotive seat belt market.

Product recall due to technical faults is the primary concern for these market players and therefore, manufacturers who have established themselves via customer satisfaction for a considerable duration of time are ahead of the curve. In addition to achieving greater technical expertise, major players in the global automotive seat belt market are also focused on acquisitions and partnerships, product innovation via research and development activities, and geographical expansion. Most of the players in this market are concentrating on opening manufacturing plants in the emerging economies in Asia Pacific – a region that currently has a proliferating demand for passenger vehicles. Moreover, prominent players are also aspiring for long-term contracts with automotive manufacturers and raw material suppliers in order to maintain their position of strength in the global automotive seat belt market.

BEAVER FALLS - With a potent offense capable of having any player score 20 points on a given night, Lincoln Park's defensive ability often gets overlooked.
   
 Tuesday night, in a heated battle against Beaver Falls for the Section 1-3A title, it was Lincoln Park's defense that sealed the win.
   
 Lincoln Park held the Tigers without a basket from the floor and just two made free throws in the final eight minutes to pull away and win 73-53. The win was the ninth straight for Lincoln Park and enabled the Leopards (16-2, 10-0) to clinch the section title two conference games remaining.
   
 "We're starting to play better," Lincoln Park coach Mike Bariski said. "And to do it in this environment, one of the greatest gyms in Western Pennsylvania…Aliquippa, Beaver Falls, Lincoln Park, they're wars. That's what this was."
   
 Unsurprisingly, the game was physical and fast from the opening tip. Lincoln Park roared out to an early lead thanks to a spark from guard Johnnie Bryant, who had eight points in the first quarter.
   
 "That's why I like these guys - in the first couple minutes of the game, Johnnie came out flying and got bucket after bucket," senior guard Isaiah Smith said. "He ended up with like eight points in the first quarter and that just shows what kind of team we are, and I love it."
   
 Beaver Falls answered, thanks to spirited play from guard Michael Conley, who scored 14 points in the first half. The Tigers briefly held a lead in the first and kept the game close in the second quarter, but Lincoln Park's balance proved problematic. Andre Wilder scored 15 first half points to help shoulder the load for Lincoln Park.
   
 "When someone's cold, someone else is hot," Wilder said. "There's always somebody that's willing to carry the load when we need it."
   
 Wilder has played the entire season with a knee injury he suffered in August. Despite occasional irritation, Wilder said he feels normal after months of rehab.
   
 "Andre's an end of the year guy. Last two years, Mr. Playoffs. At the end of the year, he turns it up," Bariski said. "We went real slow with him early in the year because of his knee. Now we're giving him a little bit more and little bit more, so he's ready to go."
   
 There was a physical toll to the game, as Bryant, Beaver Falls guard Anthony Franchi, and Tigers forward Kai Hauser all suffered injuries. Bryant and Hauser later returned, but Franchi did not. The intensity also briefly boiled over late in the third quarter, when Beaver Falls forward Camden Glass got tied up with Lincoln Park's Montae Reddix. Players had to be separated and Glass was assessed a flagrant foul.
   
 Beaver Falls regrouped after the scrum and outscored Lincoln Park 8-2 in the final three minutes to make it 58-51 entering the final quarter. That's when Lincoln Park shut down the Tigers' offense, as Beaver Falls couldn't make a basket in the final eight minutes.
   
 "After about three-and-a-half minutes, we decided to go zone," Bariski said. "I was saving that to see if they could adjust to it. It worked. We kind of confused them a little bit."
   
 Smith was closely guarded throughout the game by Beaver Falls guard Shileak Livingston but led the way with 16 points for Lincoln Park. He also showcased his deft passing ability with nifty bounce passes and an eyebrow-raising between the legs backwards pass on a fastbreak.
   
 "I just used what I know to try to get open - use my body, use my hands, do everything I can to get open. I've been dealing with that all year," Smith said.
   
 Conley led Beaver Falls with 24 points, which had its five-game winning streak snapped. The Tigers (12-5, 7-2) can lock up second place in their three games remaining against Neshannock, Riverside, and Aliquippa.

The NHS has announced new "expert rapid response teams" in order to help support older people to remain well at home and avoid hospital admissions.
 New plans outlined by the health service say that the teams will be able to be on hand within two hours, as part of the NHS' Long Term Plan to support England's ageing population and those with complex needs.
 Backed by £14 million of investment, local health service and council teams will begin the roll out of the services - dubbed "Urgent Community Response" teams - from April. The teams will give those who need it fast access to a range of qualified professionals who can address both their health and social care needs, including physiotherapy and occupational therapy, medication prescribing and reviews, and help with staying well fed and hydrated.
 The NHS working "hand in glove" in the community, with "council-funded social care services can be the difference between an older person or someone with long-term health needs spending a week or a month on a ward," explained NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens.
 He continued, "That's why as part of our Long Term Plan for the NHS we are putting community services front and centre, and backing them with a growing share of the NHS budget - and putting in place these new standards will give people and their families peace of mind about what they can expect from their local services when they need help most."
 Seven "accelerator" sites will pilot the service, the NHS says, working together to standardise how urgent community services will be measured, and delivered consistently across the country, 365 days a year.
 Further areas across England will then receive extra funding to begin working to the new standards from 2021, with every part of the country covered by April 2023.
