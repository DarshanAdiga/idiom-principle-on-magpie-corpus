A number of small music clubs in Japans western city of Osaka have emerged as a new transmission ground for the coronavirus, showing the difficulty of stemming the outbreak even as authorities have focused on stopping large gatherings.Japan has closed schools, zoos and theme parks, and drastically scaled back public events since the outbreak. The annual spring sumo tournament is being held in Osaka without spectators, leaving public broadcaster NHK to televise bouts of wrestlers facing off in an eerily quiet stadium. Despite those steps, and the governments urging telecommuting, there are signs that smaller crowds - including those at restaurants and tiny live houses where fans stand cheek to jowl to hear live music - are spreading the virus.Osaka reported its first coronavirus case on Feb. 27. As of Sunday, it had 55 cases, of which 49 were linked to four small music venues, the local government said. Many of the cases concentrated on three dates Feb. 15, 16, and 19 - but a possible cluster-type spread wasnt identified until early March, Osakas daily announcements show. Many of those infected were in their 30s and 40s and showed minimal or no symptoms.Thirty-four cases were linked to one venue in particular - Soap opera classics Umeda - and another 18 to Live House Arc. About 100 people attended each performance at the clubs. Another 19 people outside of Osaka, from as far away as Hokkaido, the northernmost island, and Kumamoto, in the southernmost main island of Kyushu, have also been traced back to those two venues, authorities said.Infections have been found in people who had been to two other venues - LIVE HOUSE Rumio and americamura FANJ twice, said the local government. All four clubs, located within a radius of around 3 kms 1.9 miles of each other in the city centre, have since been disinfected under the direction of Osaka health authorities.The only way to prevent this disease from a very rapid transmission and high infection rate is to reduce person-to-person contact, said Eyal Leshem, the director of the Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases at Sheba Medical Center in Israel, which has treated coronavirus patients evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Communities that are experiencing what we call community transmission need to shift to the stage of outbreak response called mitigation, Leshem said, adding that meant social distancing as a means to prevent person-to-person infection.UNDERGOUND MUSIC SCENE INFECTED Already, there are signs that the virus is spreading beyond people who were in the clubs.

College scholarships to play video games?
 It's not as crazy as you think; in fact it's happening now, and at least two Wisconsin legislators want to make sure the state isn't left behind.
 In mid-February, state Reps. Tip McGuire, D-Kenosha, and Kalan Haywood, D-Milwaukee, introduced LRB-3801, creating a grant program for Wisconsin schools to establish esports programs.
 McGuire noted that esports — i.e. video-game-based competitions — is a rapidly growing field that provides a competitive environment that can be more inclusive than traditional athletic events.
 At the start of the 2018 school year, there were 128 colleges/universities offering approximately $15 million in scholarships related to esports, McGuire said. In five years, that number is expected to rise to 800 colleges/universities and $100 million in scholarships.
 Not unlike sporting events, esports tournaments draw thousands of spectators and rake in millions of dollars. According to statistics compiled by Newzoo, there were nearly 900 major esports events in 2019 that brought in ticket revenue of more than $56 million.
 And it is possible to "go pro" in esports, with top gamers making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.
 Also notable is that esports can be played on a level field by anyone — height, weight, gender and physical prowess are not factors.
 At the same time, esports have been shown to have the same benefits as regular sports, with an emphasis on teamwork, communication and overcoming obstacles.
 Like a football or basketball team, players on esports teams train regularly, taking part in drills and sharpening their acumen.
 Gateway Technical College announced the formation of an esports club this year, and UW-Parkside is preparing to offer an esports program in the fall. More and more high schools and colleges are also starting esports teams.
 As the activity explodes, it stands to reason that the state should step up.
 “The passage of this bill would be a critical step in positioning Wisconsin as a leader in the global esports industry,” said James O’Hagan, Racine educator and founder of the Academy of Esports.
 “With a projected $100 million in collegiate scholarships by 2023, the funds in this bill will ensure equitable access to this extraordinary opportunity for our state’s students and place Wisconsin at the forefront of the national conversation about education and esports.”
 The time for scoffing at gamers and stereotyping them is over. Esports is a wave of the future and should be regarded no differently than traditional sports.
 We agree that Wisconsin should take the plunge into esports and strongly consider the merits of the bill proposed by the legislators.

Inside a giant decontamination facility at the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant, workers in hazmat suits monitor radioactive water pumped from three damaged reactors, making sure its adequately though not completely treated. Three lines of equipment connected to pipes snaking around in this dimly lit, sprawling facility can process up to 750 tons of contaminated water a day. Four other lines elsewhere in the plant can process more.From there, the water is pumped to a complex of about 1,000 temporary storage tanks that crowd the plants grounds, where additional tanks are still being built. Officials say the huge tanks will be completely full by the summer of 2022. The decontamination process, which The Associated Press viewed on a recent tour, is a key element of a contentious debate over what should be done with the nearly 1.2 million tons of still-radioactive water being closely watched by governments and organizations around the world ahead of this summers Tokyo Olympics.The plants operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., or TEPCO, says it needs to free up space as work to decommission the damaged reactors approaches a critical phase. Its widely expected that TEPCO will gradually release the water into the nearby ocean following a government decision allowing it to do so. The company is still vague on the timing. But local residents, especially fishermen, are opposed to the plan because they think the water release would hurt the reputation of already battered fisheries, where annual sales remain about half of the level before the nuclear accident, even though the catch has cleared strict radioactivity tests.TEPCO Chief Decommissioning Officer Akira Ono says the water must be disposed as the plants decommissioning moves forward because the area used by the tanks is needed to build facilities for the retrieval of melted reactor debris. Workers are planning to remove a first batch of melted debris by December 2021. Remote control cranes are dismantling a highly contaminated exhaust tower near Unit 2, the first reactor to get its melted fuel removed. At Unit 3, spent fuel units are being removed from a cooling pool ahead of the removal of melted fuel.The dilemma over the ever-growing radioactive water is part of the complex aftermath of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami that hit on March 11, 2011, destroying key cooling functions at the Fukushima Dai- ichi plant. Three reactors melted, releasing massive amounts of radiation and forcing 160,000 residents to evacuate. About 40,000 still havent returned. Except for the highly radioactive buildings that house the melted reactors, most above-ground areas of the plant can now be visited while wearing just a surgical mask, cotton gloves, a helmet and a personal dosimeter. The area right outside the plant is largely untouched and radiation levels are often higher.The underground areas remain a hazardous mess. Radioactive cooling water is leaking from the melted reactors and mixes with groundwater, which must be pumped up to keep it from flowing into the sea and elsewhere. Separately, even more dangerously contaminated water sits in underground areas and leaks continuously into groundwater outside the plant, experts say. The contaminated water pumped from underground first goes through cesium and strontium removal equipment, after which most is recycled as cooling water for the damaged reactors. The rest is filtered by the main treatment system, known as ALPS, which is designed to remove all 62 radioactive contaminants except for tritium, TEPCO says.Tritium cannot be removed from water and is virtually harmless when consumed in small amounts, according to Japans industry ministry and nuclear regulatory officials. But despite repeated official reassurances, there are widespread worries about eating fish that might be affected if the contaminated water is released into the sea. Katsumi Shozugawa, a radiology expert at the University of Tokyo who has been analyzing groundwater around the plant, said the long-term consequences of low-dose exposure in the food chain hasnt been fully investigated.At this point, it is difficult to predict a risk, he said. Once the water is released into the environment, it will be very difficult to follow up and monitor its movement. So the accuracy of the data before any release is crucial and must be verified. After years of discussions about what to do with the contaminated water without destroying the local economy and its reputation, a government panel issued a report earlier this year that narrowed the water disposal options to two diluting the treated water to levels below the allowable safety limits and then releasing it into the sea in a controlled way, or allowing the water to evaporate in a years-long process. The report also urged the government to do more to fight the reputational damage to Fukushima fishing and farm produce, for instance by promoting food fairs, developing new sales routes and making use of third- party quality accreditation systems.TEPCO and government officials promise the plant will treat the water for a second time to meet legal requirements before any release. At the end of the tour of the treatment facility, a plant official showed a glass bottle containing clear water taken from the processing equipment. Workers are required to routinely collect water samples for analysis at laboratories at the plant.Radiology technicians were analysing the water at one lab, where AP journalists were not allowed to enter. Officials say the treated water will be diluted with fresh water before it is released into the environment. Doubts about the plants water treatment escalated two years ago when TEPCO acknowledged that most of the water stored in the tanks still contains cancer-causing cesium, strontium and other radioactive materials at levels exceeding safety limits.Masumi Kowata, who lives in Okuma, a town where part of the plant is located, said some of her neighbors are offering their land so that more storage tanks can be built. We should not dump the water until we have proof about its safety, she said..
