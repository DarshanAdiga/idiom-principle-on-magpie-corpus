So much for the days when people could dismiss concerns about the coronavirus with light hearted jokes about not drinking Corona beer. Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency Tuesday, putting the state's official seal on the seriousness of the situation.
 That doesn't mean that the Colorado National Guard will be enforcing martial law or that residents should start preparing for Armageddon. It simply means that state officials are trying to take some reasonable steps to minimize the impact of the disease.
 Emphasis on the word "reasonable." Polis didn't suggest that we should abandon all hope and retreat into underground bunkers. Rather, the governor said he would look at ways to provide financial compensation for people who need to stay at home to avoid spreading illness to others. And he promised to make medical testing more accessible for people who might need it. And people over age 65 temporarily will be allowed to renew their drivers' licenses online instead of visiting a Department of Motor Vehicles office.
 All sensible, measured responses.
 Nowhere in the governor's words was there a call for healthy people who are showing no signs of infection to rush to their doctors' offices, demanding tests to give them peace of mind. Nor was there an endorsement of some of the other things anxiety-ridden people are doing, a few of which are downright goofy.
 Senate President Leroy Garcia, a practicing paramedic, struck the right tone when he suggested that people go about their normal routines, with a few extra precautions.
 These precautions include washing hands often and thoroughly, which grown adults should have known to do long before the coronavirus reached our borders. And trying not to repeatedly touch your faces, which is one way many types of viruses are spread. And if you're feeling sick, stay home from work.
 These aren't different from the steps people always should follow during cold and flu season. They're just common sense.
 We can't say common sense is guiding the people who feel the need to purchase every bottle of hand soap and sanitizer they see. If you stockpile those types of supplies so your neighbors can't find them, aren't you just exposing them to greater risk of infection? And if your neighbors become infected, doesn't that put you at greater risk of infection in the long run? Think it through.
 Another phenomena we see happening is that some people are blaming "the media" for causing panic. Wrong. Without the media, people would know nothing about this virus or the precautions that can help prevent its spread. People should be grateful the media gives them access to that potentially live-saving information.
 Yes, there are a lot of sources of information available on the media -- and not all of them are 100 percent reliable. In this information age, it's especially important to consider the source.
 However, if you choose to take your virus prevention tips from your friends on Facebook instead of trained health care professionals, then that's on you and not the big, bad media.
 We're going to make it through this. If we're lucky, with no more than a few inconveniences along the way. There's an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Another saying that applies here is an ounce of perspective is worth a pound of panic.

President Donald Trump faced one of the gravest threats of his political career as the coronavirus pandemic spread, leaving fellow Republicans to worry that the White Houses response and the hit to the economy would harm his re-election prospects. U.S. stock market indexes that Trump has touted throughout his term as evidence of his success plunged into bear market territory on Thursday - a day after he tried to calm Americans fears with an Oval Office address that promised economic stimulus and a 30-day travel ban for Europeans.Some Republicans worried that the measures were too little, too late for an administration that for several weeks minimized the risk of the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus that has killed at least 39 Americans. The presidents early downplaying and politicizing of the virus hurt his credibility and will make people question the administrations readiness from now until the day this passes, said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist who ran Chris Christies gubernatorial campaigns in New Jersey.The presidents greatest strength has been the economy. If the stock markets continue to tank, and real people begin to hurt financially, it will hurt the president politically. Trump emerged triumphant last month after his Senate acquittal in a Democratic-led impeachment drive, ready to ride high on a strong economy as a crowded field of Democratic candidates bickered over who was best to take him on in Novembers general election.The narrative quickly changed. Moderate Democrats in the past two weeks have consolidated their support behind former Vice President Joe Biden over liberal Senator Bernie Sanders. They are betting that Biden can draw support from across the party, as well as from suburban moderates and disaffected Republicans. Biden seized the chance to offer a contrast to voters with his own coronavirus speech on Thursday. He lambasted the administrations handling of the crisis while seeking to portray himself as a steady, experienced hand in the face of a public health emergency.Id rather be Joe Biden than Trump right now, said a Republican official close to the White House. A month ago, Trump is looking at Bernie Sanders and a strong economy and rising favorability after impeachment. Coronavirus cannot have a positive impact. Trumps re-election campaign defended the presidents actions and in a statement accused Biden of trying to capitalize politically and stoke citizens fears.The growing threat from the coronavirus forced Trump on Thursday to reverse course and suspend his large campaign rallies. The safety, security and health of the American People is President Trumps top priority right now, the Trump campaign said in a text.ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TRUTH Noting that Trump had called the disease a foreign virus, Biden warned against xenophobia and said the coronavirus does not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.Biden laid out his own plan for dealing with the outbreak, including emergency paid sick leave for workers and widely available free testing for the virus, saying the number of tests should number in the millions, not the thousands. The Trump administration has been criticized for failing to produce enough tests to meet demand. This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration, the former vice president said in his 20-minute address from his home state of Delaware. Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth.Sanders, who has vowed to remain in the race despite lengthening odds, also bashed Trumps handling of the crisis. He called for stronger action by government agencies to halt the spread of the virus and for measures such as paid sick leave and unemployment compensation for those affected. During a crisis we must make sure that we care for the communities most vulnerable to health and economic pain, Sanders told reporters in his hometown of Burlington, Vermont.A Trump supporter and fundraiser said the coronavirus outbreak had been politicized, like every issue in the United States. The battle lines are drawn, said Jim Worthington, a health club executive in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. If you like Trump, you think hes done all the things right, like cutting off travel to China. If youre a Democrat, you think the opposite.I think hes been ahead of the issue, and the media has really overhyped it, Worthington said, adding that he thought the virus should be taken seriously. The crisis has reshaped the contours of the presidential campaign. Democratic officials announced on Thursday that Sundays televised debate between Biden and Sanders would be moved to Washington from Arizona.Officials had already decided not to allow an audience into the debate hall, citing contagion concerns. Biden, Sanders and Trump have all canceled campaign events in recent days after warnings from public health officials about holding large-scale gatherings. Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold Democratic nominating contests on Tuesday.Bidens campaign on Wednesday converted planned rallies in Florida and Illinois into virtual events and on Thursday said all staffers would begin to work from home beginning Saturday. Sanders staffers will also work from home, reaching out to voters online instead of holding large events or door-to-door canvasses, his campaign said Thursday. Late Thursday, Trumps campaign said its events would also all be conducted in a virtual setting, including moving training sessions online.One Republican strategist said Trumps handling of the coronavirus was hurting him now but that it was too soon to gauge its impact on his long-term political prospects. ReutersIpsos polling from March 9-10 showed 55 of Americans disapproved of Trump, while 40 approved, largely unchanged from the past year. A few weeks ago, the presidents supporters were very dismissive of the virus. Today, they are being very silent, the Republican political operative said. Its a supply chain issue, and hes the supply chain president. When he says we have test kits on the ground and we dont, thats a real problem.Reporting Steve Holland in Washington and Joseph Ax in Princeton, New Jersey, additional reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, Jarrett Renshaw, Susan Heavey, Jason Lange and Sharon Bernstein Editing by Scott Malone, Jonathan Oatis, Lisa Shumaker and Daniel Wallis

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has tested positive for the coronavirus, the club said on Thursday, prompting the Premier League to announce an emergency meeting on Friday.Arsenals first-team squad are set to self-isolate as a result of Artetas status and the clubs Hale End training centre has been temporarily closed. Brighton Hove Albion, who were scheduled to play Arsenal on Saturday, announced that the match had been postponed.The Premier League had issued a statement earlier on Thursday saying that all Premier League matches will go ahead as scheduled this weekend but they are facing pressure to suspend the season. Arsenal personnel who had recent close contact with Mikel will now self-isolate in line with Government health guidelines. We expect this to be a significant number of people from Colney, including the full first-team squad and coaching staff, Arsenal said in a statement.The Arsenal announcement came after Spanish club Real Madrid said on Thursday that their team were in quarantine after one of the clubs basketball players tested positive. Players and staff of Italian champions Juventus are also in quarantine after defender Daniele Rugani tested positive on Wednesday.Arsenal said they expected those who did not have close contact with their Spanish manager to return to work in the coming days and that their training centres would undergo a deep clean. Mikel and the full first-team squad, players and staff, will be fully supported, and we look forward to getting back to training and playing as soon as medical advice allows. Obviously Mikels full recovery is the priority now for us all, said the clubs head of football Raul Sanllehi.It is clear we will not be able to play some fixtures on their currently scheduled dates. Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers, who has three players in self-isolation after showing symptoms of the virus, said the season should be now stopped.There is absolutely no doubt, from a logical perspective. Theres the public health and ethical side as well, he said. Players could be going into games and they could be unclear if opposition players are infected. You think of how it all connects with the throw-ins. Ultimately there should be no risks taken in the publics health which is key, Rodgers added.Arteta, 37, who joined Arsenal in December after working as assistant coach to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, said he had felt ill prior to taking the test. This is really disappointing but I took the test after feeling poorly. I will be at work as soon as Im allowed, he said.Arsenals Premier League game at Manchester City scheduled for Wednesday was postponed after the owner of Greek club Olympiakos, who the Gunners played in the Europa League, had contracted the virus. Arsenal said a number of their players had met Evangelos Marinakis after the game on Feb. 27.

Hideki Matsuyama heard plenty of cheers on the way to matching the course record at the TPC Sawgrass on Thursday, firing an opening round nine-under 63 to grab a two-shot lead at the Players Championship. But the 28-year-old Japanese golfer wont be hearing any more applause this weekend after the PGA Tour announced mid-round that spectators would be banned for the remainder of the tournament in an effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.If fans want to see more of Matsuyama and the rest of the worlds top players battle for golfs biggest purse of 15 million they will have to watch on television. That is the only place fans will see golfers for the next month with PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan announcing a spectators ban from all tournaments until after April 5.The ban ends just ahead of the April 9-12 Masters at Augusta National where the years first major is due to be contested. Taking advantage of ideal morning conditions, Matsuyama got his round off to a flying start with four consecutive birdies.But the highlight and biggest cheer came on his final hole where he rolled in a 25-foot eagle putt at the par-five ninth to become the ninth player to shoot 63 on the course. You hit a good shot or make a good putt, the crowd reaction kind of gets you going, said Matsuyama, the only blemish on his card a bogey at the par-five 16th.Its probably going to be strange for all of us playing without spectators, but its still golf, well just go out and play our best. I think all of us will have to go back to our college days to play without a gallery.Matsuyamas performance earned him a two-stroke cushion over South African Christiaan Bezuidenhout, American Harris English and South Koreas Kim Si-woo all on seven-under 65. Australian Marc Leishman and American Patrick Cantlay were two further adrift.FELT FLAT World number one Rory McIlroy, who has had six consecutive top-five finishes, opened with a level-par 72 and said the round felt flat to start with the PGA announcement coming just as he was preparing to tee off.Maybe a little flat at the beginning, said McIlroy, who is bidding to become the first player to successfully defend the Players Championship. If it had have been earlier I think they probably wouldnt have let them spectators in.So they at least they got to enjoy themselves for one day and yeah, now its going to look a little different. The day began with happy fans filing into TPC Sawgrass and the PGA Tour under fire for pushing ahead with play while most of North Americas other major sports leagues and events were cancelling or postponing competitions.Overnight the NBA had announced it was suspending its season indefinitely and pressure continued to mount in the morning as the Miami Open, one of tenniss biggest tournaments, was cancelled and Major League Soccer was suspended for 30 days. The mood turned sour as word filtered through the galleries and the field that the PGA Tour had decided to take drastic steps in an attempt to curb the spread of the outbreak.As golfers walked off the course they looked around at the fans milling about and pondered what is was going to look and feel like playing the next three rounds without spectators. Its going to be surreal. Its going to be bizarre feeling, especially this event where crowd interaction is such a big key to this golf tournament, said Graeme McDowell, after the Northern Irishman had turned in an opening round four-under 68.But what were doing here is insignificant in comparison to whats happening in the world.

Tokyo 2020 organisers said on Friday they were moving ahead with preparations to hold safe and secure Games on schedule, after U.S. President Donald Trump said officials should consider delaying the event for one year amid the coronavirus pandemic.Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called Trump in the morning to discuss the pandemic, domestic media said, citing government sources. They did not mention whether Abe raised Trumps comments on the delay on the call. Japan has sought to squash speculation that the event, which has cost it at least 12 billion in preparations and attracted more than 3 billion in domestic sponsorships, could be cancelled or postponed as the number of cases grows worldwide, including in Japan.The Tokyo 2020 organising committee wants to move ahead with preparations for a safe and secure Games this July, the organisers told Japans public broadcaster NHK. It added that to that end, it is monitoring the coronavirus pandemic together with the international Olympic and Paralympic bodies, receiving advice from the World Health Organization, and coordinating with the government and the Tokyo authorities.Abe has staked his legacy as the longest-serving Japanese prime minister on staging a successful Games and bringing a significant boost to the stagnant economy with tourism and consumer spending. The outbreak has already crippled global travel and hit Olympic qualifiers and other sports events. Japan has shuttered schools. Public health officials have discouraged large gatherings to curtail the spread of the highly contagious disease, and major soccer tournaments, National Basketball Association games and other sports have been halted.I just cant see having no people there, Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. Maybe they postpone it for a year... if thats possible, he said, adding he would not officially make that recommendation to Abe, who could make his own decision.I like that better than I like having empty stadiums all over the place. I think if you cancel it, make it a year later thats a better alternative than doing it with no crowd, Trump said. One of more than two dozen members of the board of the organising committee, Haruyuki Takahashi, told Reuters this week that if the Games could not be held in the summer, it would be most feasible to delay them by a year or two. He told other media the decision should be made before May.Takahashi also told Reuters the organisers had started working on scenarios for how the virus could affect the Games. A sponsor representative said the plans were confidential and were not being shared with the companies. Tokyo 2020 chief Yoshiro Mori vehemently denied the Games would be cancelled, but added at news conference in the wake of Takahashis comments, I am not saying there wont be any impact. I think there will be. On that, specialists in each field are looking into what to do.On Thursday, the prelude to the games got underway with the lighting of the Olympic Torch in a scaled-down ceremony behind closed doors.

He's covered every major league and major sports beat in Southern California over the years, so not much surprises him any more.
