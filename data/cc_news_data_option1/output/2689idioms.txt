Claudia Kishi happened to be everything the "model minority" stereotype wasn't. She got bad grades. She thrived in art and fashion. She wasn't struggling to belong. For those reasons and more, Asian American girls in the '80s and '90s idolized Claudia and felt seen in teen fiction. Some of those now grown fans concede the books fall short dealing with race, but a new Netflix adaptation is bringing Claudia (and her pals) into the modern age.

We have an exciting initiative that may at first seem counterintuitive. While we are working to disrupt the dairy industry, we also have compassion for the farmers who have been swallowed up by large industrial animal agriculture or are struggling because of declining milk sales, a trend that has been growing since the 1970s. Some blame large conglomerates while others blame the rise in plant based foods and changing consumer taste, but the fact is that American dairy farmers are a dying breed being forced out of business because they can’t make ends meet. Because we are a compassion-based company, plan to work with a dairy farmer to help them transition to growing crops that will become part of our supply chain (we are launching products that are based on legumes, potatoes, and oats that can all be grown on American soil). We can then ensure a healthy, sustainable supply chain for ourselves while helping a farmer stay true to his land. A food revolution is underway, and the landscape of where Americans get their protein will continue to change. We want to be part of the solution, not the treat.

Speaking of the coastal low, it has started emerging off of the North Carolina coast as of this morning. Latest data does indicate this system will continue to get its act together, and it could still develop tropical characteristics enough to potentially become Tropical Storm Fay. What’s still a bit of a question is its track. Most data this morning points to the storm’s center hugging the coastline straight into the Northeast, keeping most of the rainfall along its eastern flank and away from our region. A few model solutions push the heaviest rainfall a bit further inland, but right now it looks like the eastern shore of Maryland gets soaked on Friday, with just isolated showers and lots of clouds across the 4 State Region.

Neither writer Mark Bomback, Tyldum nor Simmons had any intention of making Barber out to be “not that bad a guy.” Simmons’ opinion is that Barber is battling for his own soul and for the soul of his son and his grandson. Then again, he’s not completely altruistic either. Barber may be stuck behind bars, but there is a delight in being able to screw with the system through other means.


  “I’ve played some nice guys, and I’ve played some horrific guys, but I’ve never played a character that I couldn’t at least understand on some level what it is that motivates him, and what it is that makes him a human being,” Simmons says. “I’m not saying other actors can’t, but I can’t just play a character if I don’t have some way into understanding his point of view, his perspective. I don’t have to like it or agree with it, I didn’t have to become a sympathizer for the Aryan Brotherhood when I was doing ‘Oz,’ but I had to understand where this guy was coming from, and why he believed what he was doing was right, and that certainly is the case with Billy Barber.”

As the death toll mounts, Newsom is facing rising pressure to further reduce the prison population, with that pressure coming from legislators, advocates and the federal judge overseeing litigation concerning the treatment of California’s inmates. The governor has said that he hopes to reduce the population at San Quentin to under 3,100 (or about 100% of its designed capacity) within the next several weeks.


   _[See also:“San Quentin is one of nation’s biggest coronavirus outbreaks. What Newsom does now may affect entire Bay Area” in the San Francisco Chronicle]_


  “At stake here is the very notion of justice,” the Sacramento Bee Editorial Board declared last week. “Many California inmates are doing time for serious crimes. The question is whether they deserve to die due to an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak. Some may still pose a threat, but many elderly and medically vulnerable prisoners are being kept behind bars for the sake of punishment rather than justice.”


  Also at stake is the operational capacity of the broader hospital system in the area, as California coronavirus cases continue to surge well outside prison walls. Marin County officials said last week that local hospitals have been inundated with intensive care patients from the prison, and Peter Chin- Hong, an infectious disease specialist at UC San Francisco, _told my colleagues_ that prisons, especially San Quentin, will probably have an impact on hospitals in the coming weeks as inmates and staff need greater levels of care.

Miyoko’s Kitchen didn’t start with a well thought-out business plan. Rather, I defied every expert advice about testing the scale-up (from my home kitchen to first proto-type facility), and just started the day I got the permit. The idea was to have a small, quaint, vegan cheese shop, but it quickly spun out of control with demand. But we were out of room almost from the beginning. We quickly outgrew our 4000 square-foot office and facility. Our “conference room” was a broken down picnic table outside. Because we didn’t really have a dedicated warehouse, packaging and oil drums littered the office and we have to push things out of the way to go from one side of the office to the other. We started renting shipping containers to serve as warehouses, and had them parked in vacant lots in the neighborhood, and we’d drive the forklift up and down the street. When large distributor trucks came, our warehouse guy would have to play traffic cop and shut down the intersection so the truck could turn the corner into our driveway. The neighbors hated us. We had meetings with them in the park across the street frequently to address their concerns and attempt to be good neighbors. We couldn’t wait to move — and neither could they. I think they must have had a block party when we moved.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has taken action against an official and if anyone was found guilty action would be taken against them. The Centre should diligently inquire into the case to bring out the facts. Mr. Rajendran said that the controversy would not impair the prospects for a continued governance for the LDF.

Two books come to mind. How People Grow by Henry Cloud and John Townsend and The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. How People Grow introduced me to the powerful transformation therapy provides. At the time of reading it, I was in a deep depression. My father had died suddenly of a heroin overdose. I was introduced to the book by my pastor, A.R. Bernard. The book helped me get over the stigma of being a Black man and not being afraid to seek therapy. The book provides countless examples of people getting healed through therapy. It was so empowering. I started going to therapy because of this book. The Alchemist came into my life via my cousin. I was on a quest of trying to find out deeper meaning of my purpose. I remember a close friendship of mine had ended and life just seemed chaotic. That book helped me understand the importance of the journey or process. Moreover, how the things we seek out or are in search for are already within us!!

In this deeper position on the right, Pogba has been forced to adopt a more self-sacrificing and disciplined role. This has, at first glance at least, meant his performances have been fairly unremarkable - he has yet to score and has managed just the one assist since the restart.
 However, this new position hasn’t been an issue for the Frenchman who seems to be relishing his new role in the side. In an interview with the club’s official website, he said; “From behind I just enjoy it. I’m enjoying just watching Bruno, Rashford, Martial and Mason, who all played the last game, and seeing them score goals. You just keep applauding, it’s beautiful… they make me enjoy football every time!”
 Even though Pogba has taken a less active role in attacking play, he remains an under the radar facilitator, doing a lot of the important work for the team that doesn't always result in a positive statistical outcome for himself.
 An example of this is below in the build-up to Martial’s impressive strike vs Bournemouth.

(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) Jonathan Obert, Amherst College (THE CONVERSATION) It’s a contentious time in the U.S., with a pandemic, racial equality, police violence and a presidential election all occupying people’s attention. Given all that stress, it can seem like people are taking the law into their own hands more often. In recent weeks, there have been confrontations over removing monuments to the Confederacy, clashes over the use of face masks, attempts to protect – or intimidate – Black Lives Matter protesters and even a renewed interest in “citizen’s arrests.” Some of these events have turned tragicallyviolent and deadly. These events show Americans moving beyond differences of opinion and free speech into private displays of force. Their participants may be trying to enforce their own ideas of what the law is, or protect property or defend their communities against threats – especially in light of the failures of police to provide a fair system of justice. Attorney General William Barr has claimed, by contrast, that this vigilantism might be a premonition of the disorder yet to come if police funding is in fact slashed in communities nationwide. As a scholar of vigilantism in U.S. history and a political scientist interested in how the state and law develop over time, I have found, as have others, that for many Americans, law and order has long been as much a private matter as something for the government to handle. Two sparks for vigilantism Vigilantism – the private, violent enforcement of public moral or legal standards – tends to rise in two types of situations, neither of which may be what people expect.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - With the news of former Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton signing with the New England Patriots, it’s time to completely close that chapter in the Charlotte book of great sports eras for Panthers fans. Something the Panthers have already done with new starting QB Teddy Bridgewater in house and firmly entrenched in his new role.Ask any coach of their early impressions of Teddy and one of the first things they mention is his intelligence. During these virtual workouts where a lot of the work is mental and learning the new system, that intelligence has been on full display.The team is allowing Teddy to run some of the meetings and he has been impressive. It reminds head coach Matt Rhule of when he was an assistant with the New York Giants and listening to a Super Bowl winning QB lead some of their team meetings.“I remember when I was with Eli Manning and I would sit there and listen to everything he would say because he was so intelligent,” said coach Rhule. “We’re coaches. We think we know it but we don’t have to stand back there and get hit. So he has a different set of reasoning than we have and hearing Teddy reminded me of that. It punches you in the face. You just see how all of a sudden people stop and kind of listen to him.”“I think from a quarterback stand point, we’re able to install, we’re able to communicate terminology even if it is different than what it was in the past,” said new offensive coordinator Joe Brady.Brady worked with Bridgewater back in 2018 when they were both with the New Orleans Saints so he knows what the Panthers have in their new signal caller.The new system that the Panthers will run is something similar to what the Saints run with a little twist that LSU ran last year at the college level. Brady was the passing game coordinator in Baton Rouge in 2019 as the Tigers had the #1 offense in the nation averaging over 568 yards per game.“Having a guy that understands a good bit of the system and what we are doing, but also has an idea about football and how to explain it and teach it to others,” said coach Brady. “It just shows how valuable you are.”But getting this offense off on the right foot in 2020 won’t just be the job of Bridgewater. The weapons around him on the offensive side of the ball will have to play a big role as well.Brady is certainly looking forward to working with the best running back in the NFL in Christian McCaffrey. He is also looking forward to getting to work with DJ Moore, who was 9th in the NFL in receiving yards in 2019 with well over 11 hundred yards. But Brady has high praise for 2 other targets who could have 2 breakout seasons in 2020... Curtis Samuel and new deep threat target Robbie Anderson.“The first thing that Robbie brings is a dynamic ability with speed, but Robbie is not just a speed wide receiver,” said Brady. “Robbie has incredible hands. He’s able to make big plays on the ball and go up for the football. Curtis is the one that I can’t wait to see what he can do best. I think Curtis is a playmaker. He fits the mold of what we are looking for in this kind of offense... a guy you can utilize all over the field.”Virtual workouts are now over for the Panthers. Next up, HOPEFULLY will be training camp which is scheduled to start on July 28th as the veterans return to Bank of America Stadium.Copyright 2020 WBTV. All rights reserved.

For identity management, we had just enforced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) across the enterprise in December 2019.

  “It is a pleasant experience to inaugurate these bridges that ‘connect people’, at a time when the world is insisting on keeping distance, being isolated from each other [due to COVID-19]. I would like to congratulate the BRO on completing this important task with great skill,” Mr. Singh said after inaugurating the bridges through videoconference.


  In the last two years, with the use of latest technologies and state of the art equipment, the BRO had done cutting of over 2,200 km, about 4,200 km of roads surfacing and completion of construction of about 5,800 metres of permanent bridges. About 1,000 km-long roads were currently under construction in Jammu region, he said.


  There had been a major surge in work completion by the BRO of late, the statement said and added that the BRO had executed about 30% more works in the Financial Year (FY) 2019-20, compared to FY 2018-19.


  The Ministry said the annual budget of the BRO that varied from ₹3,300 crore to ₹4600 crore in years 2008-2016 saw a substantial rise of ₹8050 crore in 2019-2020. “With the focus of the govt on improving infrastructure in border areas, the budget for 2020-2021 is likely to be ₹11,800 crore”. This would give a major boost to the ongoing projects and expedite the construction of strategic roads, bridges and tunnels along the northern borders.
