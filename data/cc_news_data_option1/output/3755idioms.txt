After CSK won the toss and opted to bowl, Karthik asked Dhoni how he utilised the time away from cricket during the lockdown to which he replied that he had the liberty to spend time to keep himself fit. He even praised all the team members for utilising the time well.
 "Have the liberty during lockdown to spend time on yourself to keep fit. Have to applaud every member of the squad for utilising the time well," Dhoni said at the toss.
 Dhoni, playing his first competitive game in more than a year, was present in the middle as Faf du Plessis hit the winning boundary as CSK defeated defending champions Mumbai Indians by five wickets to kick-start their IPL 2020 campaign.

 It was Dhoni's first match since he announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15 and he looked as sharp as before. While he didn't have much to do with bat, his bowling changes and fielding placements were spot on and paid dividends throughout the game.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have put in Rs 3,944 crore so far on a net basis in domestic markets in September, with participants seem heading to "attractive" investment destinations like India for potential better returns. Overseas investors bought equities worth a net Rs 1,766 crore and put in Rs 2,178 crore in the debt segment between September 1 and 18, depositories data showed. This translated into a total net investment of Rs 3,944 crore during the period under review. Prior to this month, FPIs remained net buyers for three consecutive months. They had invested Rs 46,532 crore in August, Rs 3,301 crore in July and Rs 24,053 crore in June on net basis. "This could be attributed to the excess liquidity, which is available in the global markets, making its way into Indian equities" Himanshu Srivastava, associate director - manager research, Morningstar India, said. Also, the rebalancing of FTSE's Global Equity Index Asia Pacific ex Japan and China could have also attracted flows, given the addition of few Indian stocks into the index and increased weightages in few, he added. Regarding investment in the debt segment, Srivastava said that amid aggressive bond buying by the US Federal Reserve, the yields there have come down and this could be one of the reasons for FPIs to look for other attractive investment destinations like Indian debt markets, which could potentially offer better returns. Rusmik Oza, executive vice president, head of fundamental research at Kotak Securities, said, "The investment in Indian markets during the period under review came even as FPIs remained consistent sellers in emerging markets internationally on both weekly and monthly basis. FPI flows remained positive in developed markets like US and Europe." This has mostly been because the valuations of other emerging markets had reached unattractive levels while India's valuations were still attractive in comparison, he said. Harsh Jain, co-founder and COO at Groww, said, "The US Fed has indicated that it plans to keep the interest rates near zero for the foreseeable future while also printing money and this makes parking money in the US and other developed markets a poor proposition and makes emerging markets (like India) seem attractive."

The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 action opens up on a new ground on Sunday, with Dubai hosting its first game, between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Kings XI Punjab (KXIP). After what has been quite an agonising wait for all the franchises and players, not least the fear of COVID-19 putting a spanner in the works, IPL 2020 is finally off the ground. But each match will be a challenge for those playing, since it will introduce them to something that is largely unheard of in Indian cricket - empty stands. The IPL is not used to silence when matches are on, and that could well be the biggest challenge for all the franchises.

"It was not my night at all," said Nadal, who had won all nine previous meetings against 28-year-old Schwartzman, but could not match his rival's stunning game on the red clay of the Foro Italico.
 "He played a great match, not me, when this happens you have to lose," continued the 34-year-old.
 "It's not a moment for excuses. I've spent a long time without competing, I played two good matches."
 The two-time defending champion was making his comeback after a six-month coronavirus-enforced break having skipped the US Open ahead of Roland Garros with its first round on September 27.
 "Losing as many serves, you can't expect to win a match, it's something that I have to fix, I know how to do it," he warned.
 "It's a special and unpredictable year, I'll probably go back home and let's see."
 Schwartzman next plays Canadian 12th seed Denis Shapovalov for a place in the final.
 "Today I played my best tennis," said the Argentine.
 Djokovic, meanwhile, let his frustrations spill over in a two-hour battle with his 97th-ranked German rival.
 Two weeks after his US Open default for accidently hitting a line judge with a ball, the Serb struggled to contain his emotions, throwing his racket after a lost service game, with shouts of anger resounding in the silence of the empty Central Court.
 "Well, let me tell you that it's not the first nor the last racquet that I'll break in my career. I have done it before," he warned.
 "I'll probably do it again. I don't want to do it, but when it comes, it happens.
 "That's how I guess I release sometimes my anger."
 Djokovic was broken four times before advancing to his 11th semi-final in Rome, where he reached the final nine times and won four titles.
 The 33-year-old next plays Norway's Casper Ruud who also needed to fight to get past Italian fourth seed Matteo Berrettini 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7/5).
 "Clay is definitely Casper's preferred surface," said Djokovic of his first meeting with the 34th-ranked Norwegian.
 "This is where he feels most comfortable. It's semi-finals and it is anybody's game. I'll do some homework and be ready for that one."
 Ruud -- son of former player Christian Ruud -- becomes the first Norwegian to reach the last four of a Masters tournament.
 Ruud, 21, was relishing "a great opportunity for me to play against one of the big three".
 Berrettini's elimination ended home hopes in the tournament which will be open to 1,000 spectators from Sunday's semi-finals.
 In the women's competition, Simona Halep remained on track for a first Rome titles, advancing to the semi-finals after Kazakh rival Yulia Putintseva retired while trailing 6-2, 2-0.
 Halep has twice finished runner-up in Rome in 2017 and 2018, and "really wants to win" the tournament.
 "It's one of the biggest goals now," said Halep who is on a run of 12 consecutive victories after winning in Dubai in February and in Prague after the lockdown.

Delhi Capitals has bolstered their line-up this year with the addition of Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, and Shimron Hetmyer. The side is yet to win the IPL trophy but this year the Shreyas Iyer-led franchise would be looking to go all the way.
 "We have a very good squad in place and the last season was probably a breakout season for the team with the rebranding and the change of name. The cricket that we played last year was outstanding. The batting side of things especially when it comes to Indian players is much sorted. We have added some players like Shimron Hetmyer, Marcus Stoinis, and Alex Carey as overseas batsmen. Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje are, to be honest, our weapons, and Nortje has been incredibly impressive since he has been here and we have added Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane two very experienced Indian players. I am really happy with the squad," Ponting said.

 "Anrich Nortje has been one of the most impressive fast bowlers since he has arrived and he can ball a variety of deliveries and with Rabada, Ishant Sharma and Mohit Sharma and there haven't been many through the history then closing out death overs than Mohit Sharma, you can also add Keemo Paul to the mix who did a great job for us last year. Marcus Stoinis has been used by Australia to bowl in the death overs and Ashwin we are pretty much covered. We cannot play all of them in one game so the makeup becomes very important so that we have enough options during the power play, middle and death overs," said Ponting.

By Baidurjo Bhose   Dubai [UAE], September 20 (ANI): The coronavirus pandemic might have forced the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to push the 13th edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to UAE, but fans in India can look forward to the resumption of cricketing action in the country with the England series.   Speaking to ANI, a BCCI official in the know of developments said that cricket fans in India can expect to see their favorite stars in action in their own stadiums with England's tour of India.  
 "The current situation saw us push the IPL to UAE after getting permission from the Indian government. We have been in constant touch with the authorities and have been abiding by the rules and various advisories as the world look to fight the pandemic. The advisories at the time of planning for this IPL season had more stringent restrictions in place. However, we are hopeful of conducting the England series in India itself now that the restrictions have eased and we are working with our partners to have a bio- secure bubble in place. We would therefore see a cricketing action restart in our country. It may still be a while before the spectators could return to watch live action but it will obviously happen in due course," the official said.   Asked if the recent MOU signing with the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) also meant that UAE could play second home for the BCCI, the official said that it has been a delight to work with the ECB.   "It is not the first time that we have worked with the Emirates Cricket Board. They always make us feel at home. They have been excellent and the professionalism that we have seen is something ECB should be proud of but it is not surprising with the dynamic Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan's watch. It is not easy to host a tournament like the IPL in these circumstances with not just so many players, but so much happening in the backroom as well. While ECB and we would definitely look to work together for the growth of the game, the England series is likely to happen in India."   BCCI and ECB have signed an MoU and taking to Twitter, BCCI Secretary Jay Shah wrote, "I along with Vice Chairman of Emirates Cricket Board, Khalid Al Zarooni signed an MoU & Hosting agreement between @BCCI and @EmiratesCricket to boost the cricketing ties between our countries. BCCI President, @SGanguly99 & Treasurer, @ThakurArunS were present on the occasion."   In fact, the Chennai Super Kings skipper MS Dhoni also appreciated the effort put in by those working behind the scenes to host the IPL. Dhoni returned to the cricket field with a win over Mumbai Indians as he last played a match during the 2019 World Cup when New Zealand beat India in the semi-final. He announced his retirement on August 15 this year. (ANI)

Perth Glory owner Tony Sage's revelation that he may stand down players amid an ongoing pay dispute has left the FFA and the players union frustrated.
 The outspoken Glory boss says his club is facing a reduction in revenues of up to 75 per cent due to falling broadcast and gate income during the COVID-19 crisis.
 A-League players voted last week to reject a proposed 30 per cent pay cut for the 2020-21 campaign from clubs as part of a collective bargaining agreement process with Professional Footballers Australian (PFA).
 Sage says he may have no option but to stand players and staff down after the proposal was knocked back.
 "Our revenue from the broadcast rights has dropped by almost 50 per cent and in light of the unprecedented worldwide pandemic, our gate receipts remain uncertain because of WA's hard borders," Sage said in an open letter to Glory members.
 "These border restrictions will be another huge hit to our revenue of about 30 per cent.
 "So in total, Glory's total revenue may drop by up to 75 per cent for the upcoming season."
 During the coronavirus enforced shutdown of the past season, all Australian- based A-League clubs except Melbourne City, Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory stood down players.
 A short-term deal - which involved heavy player pay cuts - was then agreed in order to complete the campaign.
 "Some other clubs will also stand down players and staff, other clubs may pay 50 per cent of current salaries, but all owners are unanimous in offering the players a 30 per cent reduction for the upcoming season because that's all the money there is," Sage said.
 In response to Sage's comments, an FFA spokesman said it was an underwhelming start to the club's independent management of the competition, which was achieved via an in-principle agreement in July.
 "The game is in good shape, but the league requires significant work," the spokesman told AAP.
 "This is where the owners come in with the original intent of the unbundling of the leagues from FFA."
 The PFA said Sage's comments were disappointing with Glory players scheduled to hold further talks with the club on Monday.
 "Attempts to pressure the players through threats and misleading commentary is unhelpful and damaging, particularly while the players continue to work in good faith to reach a solution," co-chief executive Beau Busch said.
 The PFA has previously stated players have already had to make a financial sacrifice and it's unfair for them to be asked to accept further cuts for next season.
 While the FFA is not directly involved in the negotiations, chief executive James Johnson has warned the governing body will intervene if the two parties cannot reach an agreement.

"I am really happy with the three points and it's a time to analyse properly because we have a lot of issues," said Arteta.
 "What I like is the approach the boys had in the last 25 minutes where I could see they were a bit down and then they lift it and probably a few months ago we would have drawn or lost that game and today we win it.
 "In the end you have to find a way because there will be games like this through the season."
 After winning the FA Cup and Community Shield and starting their season with a flourish by winning 3-0 at Fulham on the opening weekend, Arsenal were expected to swot aside a West Ham team that were easily beaten by Newcastle a week ago.
 But David Moyes's men deserved something to show for their performance and felt hard done by with some decisions that went against them.
 After a relatively trouble free first weekend of the season for VAR reviews, the inconsistent application of what constitutes handball reared its head on Saturday.
 Manchester United's Victor Lindelof was penalised for handling inside the box during his side's 3-1 home defeat to Crystal Palace, but West Ham were not awarded a penalty for what seemed a much more obvious handball from Gabriel Magalhaes early on.
 "I definitely think we should have had a penalty," said Moyes. "But we don't know the rules, really, do we?"
 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang committed his future to Arsenal earlier this week by signing a new three-year contract and the Gunners' prolific goalscorer was the creator for the opening goal as he just managed to stay onside from Bukayo Saka's pass before crossing for Lacazette to power a header home.
 That was the only clear opening the hosts created before half-time and West Ham levelled just before the break when Antonio outmuscled Rob Holding to turn home Ryan Fredericks's inviting cross.
 Antonio was a constant menace to the Arsenal defence and came close twice more in the second period.
 Gabriel just did enough to take the sting out of his first effort for Bernd Leno to save on the line before Antonio powered a header back off the crossbar.
 And West Ham were made to rue those missed chances as Arsenal were clinical with their only clear sight of goal in the second-half.
 "Not to be rewarded with some points tonight is really hard on us," added Moyes. "For us just to turn off in the last five minutes, it's criminal."

By Baidurjo Bhose   Dubai [UAE], September 20 (ANI): Delhi Capitals have been dealt a blow ahead of their match against Kings XI Punjab as pace spearhead Ishant Sharma injured himself during training on Saturday and will have to be assessed before the start of their opening game on Sunday to see if he is fit to play.   Speaking to ANI, a DC support staff member confirmed that while Ishant injured himself at training on Saturday, a final call will be taken before the game.   "He did injure himself while training yesterday, but we will see how it goes. We will assess his injury status before the game and will take a call accordingly. We have the medical team which takes a final call on these matters," he said.   Ishant has been dealing with injuries off late as he was sidelined due to an ankle injury this year in January.  
 The 32-year-old Ishant made a return in February for the Test series against New Zealand, but he ended up injuring the same ankle again.   Ishant was picked up by Delhi Capitals for the 2019 edition of the tournament and after that, he was retained for the ongoing season.   In the 2019 edition, the pacer played 13 matches, managing to take 13 wickets at an economy rate of 7.58.   Delhi Capitals have bolstered their line-up this year with the addition of Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Marcus Stoinis, and Shimron Hetmyer. The side is yet to win the IPL trophy but this year the Shreyas Iyer-led franchise would be looking to go all the way.   Delhi have the likes of Kagiso Rabada, Ishant Sharma, Anrich Nortje, Mohit Sharma in the fast bowling department and the side would be looking to rattle the opposition with pace.   The IPL 2020 began on September 19 with Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians locking horns against each other. MS Dhoni-led Chennai managed to win the opening encounter by five wickets. (ANI)
