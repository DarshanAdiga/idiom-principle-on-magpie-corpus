New Delhi Unidentified cyber criminals have rolled out a service that allows anyone to create fake nude images of women from a regular photograph, a cyber research agency tracking deepfakes said in a report released on Tuesday, uncovering a growing ecosystem that has already targeted at least 100,000 women and threatens to open a new front in online sexual abuse. A deepfake is any manipulated media created by an artificial intelligence technique called deep learning. The technology first gained attention in 2017 and evolved rapidly, with experts warning that it can affect democracy and law since, among other things, deepfakes can be used to create convincing fakes about rival politicians and generate false evidence to implicate someone in crime. It has also been used to create deepfake pornography of celebrities, but Netherlands-based Sensity's report now uncovers its first widespread use in targeting virtually any individual whose images are available. The tool works only on images of women. "Our investigation of this bot and its affiliated channels revealed several key findings. Approximately 104,852 women have been targeted and had their personal "stripped" images shared publicly as of the end of July, 2020. The number of these images grew by 198% in the last 3 months," said the report.At present, most of the roughly 104,000 users and most of the victims appear to be from Russia, the report added, citing a poll in one of seven Telegram groups linked to the service - the name of which has been withheld in order to avoid publicity. At the core is a bot that lets a person upload a photograph of a woman. The bot feeds back a version with any clothing deleted and replaced by fake but at times authentic, but often evidently fake skin and private parts. The tool is available for free, but the photos will be watermarked. Users can pay $1.5 (about ₹110) to remove it, the report said."The activity on the bot's affiliated Telegram channels makes for bleak viewing. On the image sharing galleries, thousands of synthetically stripped images of young women taken from social media and private correspondence are constantly being uploaded," said Henry Ajder, an expert on deepfakes and the lead author of the report who has since left Sensity. "The bot's significance, as opposed to other tools for creating deepfakes, is its accessibility, which has enabled tens of thousands of users to non-consensually strip these images," Ajder said, adding that the most concerning aspect of the investigation was the discovery of images of underage girls. "Up until now, we've seen a relatively low amount of activity with deepfakes and paedophilic content, but this investigation provides a stark warning that this trend is definitely over," he added. According to Sensity's investigation, the tool appears to be a version of DeepNudes, a software first released anonymously in 2019 before criticism forced its developer to pull it down.But, "on July 19th 2019, the creators sold the DeepNude licence on an online marketplace to an anonymous buyer for $30,000. The software has since been reverse engineered…" Sensity added. The key difference between that the first software and this service is now the fact that people do not need access to powerful graphics processing hardware and some degree of expertise to create such nudes. "In terms of photorealism, the level of the technology is still quite primitive and in many cases, it will be possible to distinguish them (the photographs) as a fake. Still, it does not mean that this material isn't a reputation threat for people," said Giorgio Patrini, CEO and chief scientist at Sensity. "Imagine someone posts a naked photo that you didn't even take -- the quality of the image is really not what makes the difference," he added.According to Patrini, it is not established for certainty who are behind the new service. "We can state confidently that the individuals involved in the bot creation are very likely to be Russian native speakers, given the presence of this language among the users and the fact that a large part of the victim are Russian nationals," Patrini said.Deepfake nudes do not fall in specific legal definitions in most countries, making it uncharted territory for law enforcement. Experts said it is closest to crimes known as revenge pornography and non-consensual sharing of intimate images. In India, such crimes are usually tried under Section 499 (criminal defamation) and Section 354C of the Indian Penal Code (voyeurism), and Section 66E (depicting private parts of a person) and Section 67A (section against sexually explicit materials) of the Information Technology Act, according to a 2018 analysis by Yesha Paul, then at the Centre for Communication Governance (CCG), National Law University (NLU) Delhi. "The courts might be significantly challenged to analyse the evidence to see whether or not that meets the standard of proof required in criminal trials - to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt," said Gunjan Chawla, programme manager, technology and national security at CCG, NLU Delhi. There are also concerns of jurisdiction and evidence, when the illegal material is generated by an algorithm. "The courts might be significantly challenged to analyse the evidence to see whether or not that meets the burden of proof required to treat someone as guilty," she said.The use of AI to create fake nudes demonstrates the risk of putting out personal photographs, Patrini added. "People must think twice when sharing visual content online, visible to anyone. Even if the content itself is innocuous, unfortunately one day it might be repurposed and utilised maliciously against you," he said.

Armando Manzanero still has music to give. At 84, the Mexican master of romantic music, who has penned Spanish classics such as “Somos Novios” and “Contigo Aprendí”, is still working the tunes on his piano.
 When answering the phone for an interview about the Lifetime Achievement Award he’ll receive at the Latin Billboard Awards on Wednesday, he was in the middle of a recording session.
 “Everything I say and I compose, or feel, I record so it doesn’t get lost,” he said. “The only thing I have to hope for, if God still gives me time, is for some artist to record a couple songs.”
 “Until three or four years ago, I had that drive to pursue the singers at any cost,” he said. “But time has also taught me that that is not right, is not fair. I am a man who has worked hard, who has fought every step of the way. I started from the bottom up, not the other way around.”

She represented Ontario in her nationals debut in 2012 and has also skipped Northern Ontario and Manitoba teams. Fleury was a wild-card entry last season but lost the play-in game to Jones.
 Fleury, a 2019 Canada Cup finalist, has made two career appearances at the pre-Trials but has yet to qualify for the main Trials. The Tim Hortons Roar of the Rings is set to begin in late November 2021.
 "Our team was talking about who we wanted to bring on board and Sherry's name came up and we thought she would be an excellent fit for our team," Fleury said. "So I reached out to her and it just so happened she was considering getting into coaching.
 "So the timing was right and the fit seems great."
 It has been a few years since Middaugh played on the elite women's scene but she has kept busy with senior competitions. She said Fleury first approached her about a year ago but the timing didn't work out.
 "When she called again, I just thought this is fantastic, right leading up to the Olympic year," Middaugh said. "I've always been impressed with Tracy and the girls.
 "I know that they're a fairly new team but you can just tell from their experiences and the success they've already had that they're going somewhere."
 Fleury, who had a baby girl last July, said the ice at her local club is expected to go in early next month. She has had regular video calls with her teammates, who have been practising in Manitoba.
 They are aiming to compete at the Nov. 27-30 Dekalb Superspiel in Morris, Man.
 "I think we're going to have to just be adaptable this year," Fleury said. "Things kind of change day to day. But as of right now, we are planning to play about four or five events."
 Middaugh's husband, Wayne, has also transitioned to the coaching scene. He started working with Sweden's Team Anna Hasselborg - the top-ranked reigning Olympic champions - two years ago.
 "When you're working with a high-level team that's already had success, you don't want to get in their way," Sherry Middaugh said. "So for me it's going to be observing and asking a lot of questions of them of what they want for me, because they have had success.
 "We don't have to reinvent the wheel, we just have to figure out what little piece they're missing to have them go that one step farther and build towards the Olympic Trials."

I think the real question is what are the biggest challenges we face as a society. At the end of the day, the workplace reflects broader societal frameworks — lack of role models, limited access to child care and elder care, stereotyping, etc. These are the things that hold women back in the workplace. If men are raised to respect the capabilities of women and society prioritizes family issues and health care, this question would no longer be asked. The pandemic has only exacerbated this issue, where already the headlines are raging, “In the COVID economy, you can have a kid or a job.” You see policies being developed that do not take the working parent into account and not all workplaces can offer the flexibility that working parents need. Paternity leave policies are waning in the US and where they are offered, oftentimes they are not taken for a variety of reasons, again marginalizing the working mother to “figure it out”.

Dear Dave,
 I've been trying to get my sister and her husband on your plan, but they're hesitant to try living on a budget. They make good money, and both of them think doing a budget every month would be too difficult and take too much time. Do you have any suggestions I could pass along that might make them realize that making a budget isn't so hard or time-consuming?
 Kelsey
 Dear Kelsey,
 Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don't really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together. If you've followed my advice, you learned first- hand that budgeting isn't scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don't need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.
 A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It's important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what's up with the budget, because you're just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.
 Sit down together for a few minutes, once a month, and have a budget meeting where you look at your income, your outgo, and you both give every dollar a name and a job to do. It's really that simple. Share your ideas, your hopes, and your dreams for the future, as well as the fears you have. The important thing is that you're both in agreement and working together. That alone will make your lives, your budget, and your money easier to handle.
 Also, make sure you have cut up all your credit cards and closed the accounts. No more credit cards means fewer bills to add to the budget, fewer complications, and zero worries about fees and interest rates. Stick to using a debit card and cash. After all, they're both part of the plan!
 Making a schedule for budget meetings and bill payments is a good idea, too. You can even make your budget meetings a fun time by including your favorite snacks. Set up auto drafts out of your checking account to pay bills and buy your groceries on a set day every week or twice a month. When you know what to expect and when, it takes a lot of stress and potential pitfalls out of the budgeting picture.
 There's always some work and discipline that goes along with gaining control of your money. But a budget doesn't need to be torture. A little planning, communication and some basic math will go a long way - and it won't be nearly as time-consuming, or as difficult, as you think!

There's definitely something perfectly splendid about being safe at home. While I do miss going out to many places, having that extra bit of time at home has been rather refreshing.

Instead of rushing around like a crazy person, I've been taking time when I can to get lost in my drawings or read more of that book I have going currently. My head is still filled with lots of ideas and I'm letting them all spin and bounce into each other for awhile. It's fun to float inside one's imagination and just enjoy the time spent there.

"Could you imagine if I lose my whole life? What am I going to do?" he asked a rally crowd last week in Macon, Georgia. "I'm not going to feel so good. Maybe I'll have to leave the country. I don't know."
 Biden, meanwhile, was in Delaware for several days of preparation ahead of Thursday's final presidential debate. His running mate, California Sen. Kamala Harris, returned to the campaign trail after several days in Washington after a close adviser tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Late Monday, the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced that Trump and Biden will each have his microphone cut off in Thursday's debate while his rival delivers his opening two-minute answer to each of the six debate topics.
 The rule changes come three weeks after a chaotic opening faceoff between the two presidential contenders that featured frequent interruptions — most often by Trump. The open discussion portion of the debate will not feature a mute button, but interruptions by either candidate will count toward their time.
 "Look, these people are not good people — this commission," Trump said. "A lot of funny things go on with them. ... Kristen Welker is terrible. I mean she is totally partisan."
 The commission has faced pressure from the Trump campaign to avoid changing the rules, while Biden's team was hoping for a more ordered debate. In a statement, the commission said it "had determined that it is appropriate to adopt measures intended to promote adherence to agreed upon rules and inappropriate to make changes to those rules."
 Trump's campaign said he would participate in the debate despite his concerns about the new rule.
 "I just think it's very unfair," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned from Arizona. "I will participate, but it's very unfair that they changed the topics and it's very unfair that, again, we have an anchor who's totally biased."
 In addition to public polling that indicates Biden has an edge, the former vice president enjoys another considerable advantage: money.
 Over the past four months, Biden has raised over $1 billion, a massive amount of money that has significantly eclipsed Trump's once-overwhelming cash advantage.
 That's become apparent in advertising, where Biden and his Democratic allies are on pace to spend twice as much as Trump and the Republicans in the closing days of the race, according to data from the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG.
 "We have more than sufficient air cover, almost three times as much as 2016," said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien, who insisted Trump has the advantage with the campaign's field staff and data targeting.
 Though Trump has pulled back from advertising in Midwestern states that secured his 2016 win, he's invested heavily elsewhere, including North Carolina, where he is on pace to slightly outspend Biden.
 Concerns about a possible loss to Biden that have been spilling into the open in recent days have been percolating behind the scenes at the Trump campaign. Trump himself has alternated between disbelief and anger at the idea that he could lose to a candidate he views as washed up and incompetent, according to three campaign and White House officials not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

With the power line and the telephone wiring block damaged, Prodigi internet and telecommunications services were disrupted that night and into the next day. There is video showing only DeLauder and no one else in the building on the evening of June 3, Snyder said.
 Prodigi internet and telecommunications service at town hall is considered service to the public. Town employees reported phone service also was down for much of the day as Prodigi representatives corrected the damage.
 As part of his bond conditions, DeLauder cannot “go to or be on the premises of Terra Alta Town Hall or any building, structure or property owned by the Town of Terra Alta, W.Va.”
 In another indictment, a Bruceton Mills man, Jack Ernest Reeder, 40, was indicted on three charges of strangulation, driving under the influence with a minor in the vehicle, and driving on a suspended license due to DUI.
 In this case, the victim said Reeder had put his hands around her neck and choked her three separate times.
 The victim stated he choked her twice inside the residence and once outside. Reeder allegedly choked her to the point where she felt she could not breathe.
 In a second incident, Reeder was reportedly found operating a vehicle with a minor sitting in the front seat in Bruceton Mills.
 The 911 center notified the West Virginia State Police Reeder had an active DUI-related suspension on a Pennsylvania driver’s license.
 Several other indictments were handed down for burglary, conspiracy and delivery of a controlled substance.

Prison head Hanne Hoegh Rasmussen told a news conference that the escape was being investigated and that she couldn't immediately confirm media reports that Madsen took a female prison psychologist hostage inside the prison.
 “No one has been injured physically,” Hoegh Rasmussen said, adding that prison staff were getting psychological support.
 The facility has 161 cells and has a wing with inmates who have psychiatric, psychological or sexual behaviour problems.
 In 2018, Madsen was sentenced in the Copenhagen City Court to life in prison for killing Wall, a 30-year-old reporter from Sweden who he lured aboard his homemade submarine in 2017 with the promise of an interview. He dismembered her body and dumped it at sea.
 Madsen lost his appeal, shortly after apologizing to the victim’s family who were present in the appeals court. The sensational case has gripped Scandinavia.
 Madsen has denied murdering Wall. He claims she died accidentally inside the submarine, but he has confessed to throwing her body parts into the Baltic Sea.
 Life sentences in Denmark usually mean 16 years in prison, but convicts are reassessed to determine whether they would pose a danger to society if released and can be kept longer.
 A self-taught engineer, Madsen built rockets in his spare time but never went to college. In 2008, he launched his homemade UC3 Nautilus submarine.
 Wall had planned to interview Madsen for a story on a rocket program he founded in 2014, with the goal of building a crowdfunded rocket to launch himself into space. But by the time he finally texted her, his cash flow had dried up and he had cancelled the planned test launch.

At other times, Martinez failed to understand Long Island’s needs, such as when she co- sponsored prevailing wage legislation that would have hurt development efforts. While she touts her independence, that at times was problematic, such as when Martinez, 43, opposed banning religious exemptions on vaccinations for school-aged children. She should rethink her focus on parental choice over public health in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

 Two seasons ago United knocked PSG out in dramatic style to reach the competition's quarterfinals, with a nerveless Rashford scoring a last-gasp injury-time penalty to win 3-1 in Paris having lost 2-0 in Manchester.
 This time he netted in the 87th minute at a rain-soaked Parc des Princes, collecting a pass from substitute Paul Pogba and easily turning his marker before smacking a low shot past goalkeeper Keylor Navas from the edge of the penalty area.

That will be easier said than done. Because of injuries to top players Miles Sanders (knee) and Zach Ertz (ankle), the MVP options are extremely limited on this slate. We're going with the safest option there, which means we'll probably have the highest-owned MVP. That means we need some differentiation with the rest of our lineup. As a result, our strategy was to spend down on some injury replacements and leave a whopping $7,000 on the table. That gave us room to pivot off these picks if you don't like them, but spending down so much also makes this lineup a bit risky.

Oh sure, it IS a fabulous piece of stop-motion animation with the full talents of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton fully on display but the protagonist is as much a Grinchy villain as he is a misguided anti-hero, right down to the lovable dog sidekick. The whole endeavor is about Jack getting his way, completely based upon his vision, without regard for the literal vision that Sally tries to warn him of. It took me a good decade or so to realize that his boredom with what he had and then passionate embrace of this next new thing was just classic juvenile male behavior right down to the risk-taking behavior. Then I was able to reframe the film as a coming-of-age piece where Jack makes some poor decisions, has to live with the consequences, and learns the value of real friendship. After that, I am on board with the twofer holiday classic. I don't love it, but now I have probably seen it at least as many times as "The Fifth Element."

Ludhiana Skyrocketing vegetable prices have left Ludhiana residents teary-eyed this festive season. While the humble potato is priced at Rs 55 to 60 per kg in the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 70 per kg. The wholesale rates of these vegetables are Rs 28 per kg for potato and Rs 60 a kg for onion.Vegetable market arhtiyas say that the onion rates have shot up due to shortage caused by crop damage in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra following incessant rains. Area under veggie cultivation dipsMeanwhile, vegetable farmers are also bringing down area under cultivation. Mohd Gafoor, who cultivates vegetables on 63 acres in Patiala, said that he had suffered a loss of nearly Rs 30 lakh as the mushrooms, cucumber, baby corns and pumpkins which used to sell like hot cakes perished in his field during the lockdown. But this summer, he cultivated vegetables only on 12 acres and used the rest for paddy farming."Vegetables used to be in huge demand. But the market window for these is limited. And in the absence of proper mechanisms for refrigeration and storage, we had no choice but to switch to paddy. But now that the vegetable prices are hitting the roof, I am receiving rich returns for my produce," he added.Manpreet Singh Grewal, president of crop residue management wing of PAU Kisan Club, said that currently hoarding of potato and onion is leading to price rise. "As fresh crops are yet to arrive, the prices of potatoes will further rise in the coming weeks. The prices will crash by the end of the year or in the beginning of next year. With the passing of new farm laws, the central government has lifted government restrictions on hoarding, and such price variation will be common in the coming days," said Manpreet.Gurkanwal Singh, president of Sabzi Mandi Vegetable Arhtiya Association, said that prices of both onion and potato are set to rise. "We are expecting the next set of onions crop by the next month. This will likely bring some respite to residents. However, the prices of other vegetables are also going to rise due to less cultivation," said Gurkawal.

 Dear Dave,
 I've been trying to get my sister and her husband on your plan, but they're hesitant to try living on a budget. They make good money, and both of them think doing a budget every month would be too difficult and take too much time. Do you have any suggestions I could pass along that might make them realize that making a budget isn't so hard or time-consuming?
  _Kelsey_
 Dear Kelsey,
 Believe me, I hear those excuses all the time. In most cases, the people who say these kinds of things don't really understand what a budget is or how to efficiently put one together. If you've followed my advice, you learned first- hand that budgeting isn't scary once you get the hang of it. Household budgets don't need to be about hours of tedious math and complicated formulas. Like most things in life, simple is usually best.
 A good way to simplify budgeting, especially for couples, is by making it a team effort. It's important to make sure your spouse is on board, and knows what's up with the budget, because you're just asking for problems when one spouse is doing all the planning and the other is doing all the spending.
 Sit down together for a few minutes, once a month, and have a budget meeting where you look at your income, your outgo, and you both give every dollar a name and a job to do. It's really that simple. Share your ideas, your hopes, and your dreams for the future, as well as the fears you have. The important thing is that you're both in agreement and working together. That alone will make your lives, your budget, and your money easier to handle.
 Also, make sure you have cut up all your credit cards and closed the accounts. No more credit cards means fewer bills to add to the budget, fewer complications, and zero worries about fees and interest rates. Stick to using a debit card and cash. After all, they're both part of the plan!
 Making a schedule for budget meetings and bill payments is a good idea, too. You can even make your budget meetings a fun time by including your favorite snacks. Set up auto drafts out of your checking account to pay bills and buy your groceries on a set day every week or twice a month. When you know what to expect and when, it takes a lot of stress and potential pitfalls out of the budgeting picture.
 There's always some work and discipline that goes along with gaining control of your money. But a budget doesn't need to be torture. A little planning, communication and some basic math will go a long way - and it won't be nearly as time-consuming, or as difficult, as you think!

GALESBURG -- The City of Galesburg will be moving forward in its grant application to return three blocks of Simmons Street to brick, despite the opposition of some members of the public.
   
 The funding resolution for an Illinois Transportation Enhancement Program would allow the city to apply for a grant that would co-fund a $3,171,400 project to restore Simmons Street from Cherry to Seminary streets in brick as part of the city's ongoing redevelopment of downtown. The state would fund about $2 million of the project, and the city would pick up the remaining $1,171,400.
   
 While this vote was one to submit a grant and not to spend the $1.17 million outright, Alderman Peter Schwartzman took issue with the application's position tucked into the city's consent agenda, which is passed as a package alongside other items.
   
 Particularly, he was concerned about expensive items being in the consent agenda, making their discussion and deliberation more difficult. Besides the Simmons Street application, another ITEP grant in the consent agenda would be for a shared use path along South Lake Storey Road. The grant would require a 20% local match from the city, estimated to be $555,430.
   
 While neither grant is guaranteed, their high potential costs to the city led Schwartzman to argue that their position within the consent agenda was problematic.
   
 "I would suggest in the future large budget items like that get their own line item so they get some detailed discussion," he said.
   
 Mayor John Pritchard said they would take that into account in the future. The consent agenda passed 6-0, with Ward 3 Alderwoman Lindsey Hillery not present for the vote.
   
 Besides the two grant applications, the consent agenda also included the feature of Geo-Melt products for the winter season, the donation of old holiday lights to Abingdon, updates to the city's investment policy and purchasing policies and procedures, and the submission of bills and advanced checks for approval.
   
 Galesburg's downtown health food grocer will be adding alcohol to its stock. The City Council voted to allow Cornucopia Market & Deli to start selling alcohol for consumption off premises, granting the business a class C liquor license in another 6-0 vote.
   
 During the public comment section of the meeting, members of the audience questioned the application for Simmons Street, as well as the ongoing preliminary studies of an expanded Lake Storey, asking why the money for Simmons' restoration could not go somewhere else.
   
 City Manager Todd Thompson addressed these concerns in his report, saying it's important to look at funding sources on the project.
   
 "It isn't funding that would be available to do projects all over town," he said.
   
 The funding would only be able to be spent within the specific TIF district of Simmons Street, and the state would still contribute the majority of funds for the project. The project is intended to be part of the city's ongoing development of its downtown for economic growth.
   
 In other news out of the meeting, Galesburg took another step closer to a permanent home for the Steerman Fly-In. The city approved a permanent headquarters for the National Stearman Foundation. The construction cost for the 10,000-square-foot hangar will be approximately $500,000. The council agreed that the city will provide up to $150,000 for site engineering work and construction costs, $30,000 for utility connections, a grant of $50,000 for the construction of the hangar, and use of the airport grounds at a reduced rate.
   
 The funding for this project from the city will come from the economic development funds, which are sufficient for the work, according to Thompson.
   
 In the closing comments, Ward 1 Alderman Bradley Hix said he is still working on the details of a nuisance ordinance he plans to bring forward to a meeting soon.
   
 Schwartzman used his time to mention the city budget hearing that would follow the next day at City Hall. He also said the need for internet access may be greater in coming months as it gets cold, and he encouraged the city to look into setting up Wi-Fi stations in neighborhoods economically impacted by COVID.
   
 Alderman Larry Cox used his time to speak about the Lake Storey expansion project.
   
 "I would just ask that everyone keep in mind that at this time, everything is conceptual," he said.
   
 Save for the location, which has been determined by topography, other areas, like the median prices of homes along this expanded lake, are not set in stone. Cox also noted that if a median home costs $233,000 along the lake, half of houses will likely cost less, and the other half will cost more.
   
 "I would ask that anyone interested keep an open mind and participate in the public meetings," he said.
   
 The city plans to collect more information on the project next year as it continues planning for the possible expansion of the lake.
   
 "The project does have the potential to be the largest economic development project in the history of Galesburg," Cox said.
   
 He also said if anyone does have to sell their home in the process of this expansion, they will be justly compensated.
   
 Pritchard noted that the average home in the country now costs $360,000, and agreed with Cox that there is a long way to go on the project.
   
 Pritchard also noted that COVID-19 is surging in the community, and that some regions are seeing tighter restrictions as a result. If indoor dining were to restricted, he said it could be economically harmful in Galesburg. Last week, Cherry Street Bar & Restaurant closed due to lost revenues associated with the pandemic.
   
 Pritchard encouraged hand-washing, social distancing and staying home while sick.
   
 "Those are the basic things that will protect us as a group and permit us to not be overwhelmed by the virus, which will be with us for several (more) months at least," he said.

 “Why the delay? They know what they need.”
 Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary Ian Waddell said: “The news that the successful bid will be led by a British firm is welcome but it only promises a 'significant proportion' of the work will be completed in Britain, which could be open to all sorts of interpretation.
 “The facts of the matter are that despite some recent good news, British shipbuilding continues to hang by a thread.

For all those reasons, we’ve seen an embrace of automation across the board during Covid. 66% of e-commerce companies queried said the pandemic has made them more willing to invest in more automation. Major retailers and distributors are racing to install automated systems as demand continues to swell. But it all begs a broader question that transcends warehouses and fulfilment centers.

When you are in a startup, the biggest mistake you can make is being afraid to make a mistake. From spelling errors to mistranslations (always a risk when working internationally) to winging it at press interviews or going undercover at trade shows to do competitive intelligence, funny stories always abound. Add to that the working mom angle, changing diapers while on conference calls and pumping breast milk while on the road for business, and it becomes truly embarrassing! I say take it all with stride. At the end of the day, we are all human.

Ice Cube, the legendary Generation X rapper and hip hop icon, last week said he's open to working with the Trump administration on implementing his "Contract with Black America." That is a huge mistake which hurts the entire African American community.
 Cube sparked controversy after tweeting that the Trump campaign made adjustments to "their plan" for Black America after talking to him. Cube was referring to parts of his "Contract With Black America," which features a preface written by Darrick Hamilton -- one of the most respected and well known Black economists in the nation and calls for "a blueprint to achieve racial and economic justice" through polices that promote wealth creation, home ownership, small businesses criminal justice reform, and voting rights. Small parts of the "Contract" are reflected in what the Trump administration has dubbed its "Platinum Plan" with election time appeals to Black voters.
 News of Cube's seeming alliance with Trump's anti-Black political empire set Black Twitter ablaze with anger and confusion; Cube responded by casting himself as a political maverick unafraid to go against the grain. In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo, Cube said he is willing to work with people on both sides of the aisle. "I'm not playing no more of these political games, we're not part of a team ... so I'm going to whoever's in power and I'm going to speak to them about our problems, specifically," Cube said, explaining that "our" is referring to Black Americans. "I'm not going in there talking about minorities, I'm not going in there talking about people of color or diversity or none of that stuff. I'm going there for Black Americans, the ones who are descendants of slaves."

When Jimmy Goodman Jr. was growing up, he and his mom would often come back from the grocery store to see cars parked up and down the road near their home in New Milford. He knew that meant the barn behind their house was full of boxers using his dad's ring.
   
 "All he would ask is for them to turn the lights off when they left," Goodman Jr. said. "The gym was open to anybody."
   
 Jim Goodman Sr., who died Saturday at age 78 with complications from pneumonia, was the Pied Piper of Rockford boxing. He had a hand in training almost every fighter to come out of Rockford for 40 years and also trained the main trainers who succeeded him, Jimmy Goodman Jr. and Patrick Coleman.
   
 "Everyone in the neighborhood who put on gloves and boxed, they started with Jimmy Goodman coming out of Rockford," Coleman said.
   
 Goodman Sr. started the boxing program at the Flodin Boys Club, then moved it to his own home for 12 years when the Boys Club dropped boxing before starting it again downtown as part of the Patriots Gateway Community Center.
   
 "He was a special guy," Jim Flodin said. "He cared about kids. He came into my office and said we can help more kids if you have a boxing program at the Boys Club. The program grew so much we went out to the Lincoln Park Boys Club. We had over 50, 60 kids at one time. It just kept growing.
   
 "Some of those kids never left town until they joined that boxing program, then they went across the country. Jim sent groups to New Jersey and Las Vegas. It was something. The younger kids got older and joined the Golden Gloves. Seven of them became professional boxers."
   
 The best of them all was Kenny Gould, a bronze medalist at the 1988 Olympics, the last U.S. welterweight to earn a medal. Gould was trained by his dad, but Goodman was the assistant coach.
   
 "Jim Goodman was second in charge of keeping everybody in line and training at the gym," Gould said. "He was a cool guy."
   
 "Jim was a motivator," said Coleman, who was inducted into the Illinois Boxing Hall of Fame in the same class as Gould in 2017. "He taught us hard work. When Jim came into the gym and trained us, he worked just as hard as us. He used to hold up a medicine ball and walked down the line, giving every kid a chance to hit it. The ball never moved. He was a strong man."
   
 And a fun, loving and honest man.
   
 "He gave me a lot of confidence as a kid," said Coleman, who had a 29-17 record as a pro with 20 knockouts and once held the North American Boxing Federation welterweight title. "He was always telling jokes. Even the last time I saw him, he had a joke. He always kept your spirits up.
   
 "My mother trusted me to go on a plane with Mr. Goodman to New York for a fight. The first time I ever went to a boxing camp, Mr. Goodman talked my mother into it. I trained 10 years before I ever had a fight. My mom was scared, but she trusted him, and when I was 15 she finally let go. She trusted me in the hands of Mr. Goodman. That meant a lot."
   
 Boxing began to die out in Rockford in the 1990s. The Boys Club dropped the sport. Goodman built a barn behind his house to store equipment for his construction company, Jim Goodman Concrete. That plan changed quickly.
   
 "He came across a guy who was selling a ring and some heavy bags," his son said. "Dad bought it from him and started his own gym up. It didn't take much for the word to get out. Guys would show up at the barn just randomly."
   
 And the younger kids would stay after hours and do more than just box.
   
 "He'd have a yard full of 20 Black kids jumping in the pool," Coleman said. "He would train anybody who went through his doors, but the majority of them were minorities. He made us feel like family. I've got so many brothers and sisters who boxed for him, Black, white, everything.
   
 "He was a genuine good man. And if you did something wrong, in school or wherever, he would get on you. He showed us how to be a man."
   
 Goodman also gave many of the poorer kids rides to and from practice and also helped them out when he took them to out-of-town tournaments.
   
 "We didn't have money," said Mark Leslie, a former Rockford boxer in the 1970s who is now a DJ in Las Vegas going by the name of Mr. Melody. "We'd go out of town with no money and he made sure we ate. He picked us up. He gave us so much. He was dedicated. He loved the kids. No matter what color, he loved the kids. He bent over backward for us."
   
 After a dozen years at the barn, the Goodmans moved the boxing program to Seventh Street and aligned with Patriots Gateway, in part because of liability concerns of holding it at their home. Now it is moving again. The boxing center moved to First Avenue just in the last month, where head trainer Jimmy Goodman Jr. carries adds to his fathers legacy.
   
 "It's going to look like a professional boxing gym that you would see somewhere in Vegas," Goodman Jr. said.
