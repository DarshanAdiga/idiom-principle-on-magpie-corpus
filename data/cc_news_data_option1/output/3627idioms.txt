There's no resilience gene to help us deal with adversity. Experts say it's a skill to foster, a muscle to pump up.      Six months into the twin calamities of a pandemic and a tough economy, this may be a good time for a resilience workout.      Resilience is the ability to withstand, bounce back and grow in the face of stressors and changing demands. "For a long time, people believed resilience was kind of a trait, something you have or you don't," said Vanessa Downing, a psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware. "Now we know it really is much more a set of skills that can be taught and learned."      Downing, who worked for many years to help heart patients and caregivers become more resilient, now directs the ChristianaCare Center for WorkLife Wellbeing, part of Delaware's largest health care system. As colleagues have struggled to cope with COVID-19, she said, "We have really doubled down on the importance of understanding what resilience really means, and what it takes to create lasting resilience. It's a huge issue, especially at a time when there's so much facing people, whether they work in health care or not."      Dr. Abby Rosenberg, an associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, agreed.      "The time you really need to dig deep and activate your own resilience is when life seems hard," said Rosenberg, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children's Hospital. She specializes in promoting resilience among young patients with serious illness and their families.      "It's the process of harnessing the resources we need to get through that tough time and maintain our well-being. Resilience gives you the ability to say, 'Yes, it's hard, and this is how I'm going to get through it.'"      The benefits are not just psychological. Resilience helps to lower stress, and chronic stress is linked to health consequences that include high blood pressure, depression and heart disease.      A study published last year in the Journal of the American Heart Association indicated that African Americans living in neighborhoods more conducive to resilience - specifically, neighborhoods with better aesthetic quality, healthy food availability and a lack of violence - had less cardiovascular disease than their counterparts with the same level of cardiovascular risk factors who lived in other areas.      A 2018 study published in Psychological Science found people who reported higher levels of lingering negative feelings from daily stressors had more chronic conditions almost a decade later.      So, how do we become more resilient?      Take care of yourself   "That means ensuring our own basic needs are met," Downing said. "Things like getting enough sleep, trying to eat nutritious meals and making sure our social connections are there even when we have to be physically distant. That may require a lot more work than in our pre-COVID way of living."      And with so many people now working from home, it's important to set healthy work boundaries to prevent overworking and burnout. Maintain a regular work schedule and allow time for lunch and breaks.      Reflect on problems you've overcome before   "What have you done in the past when things were hard?" Rosenberg said. "That can help people think about which particular resources they need now, and to be able to ask for help."      Focus on gratitude   "Our brains are hard-wired to notice the negative, and that's what sticks with us more," Downing said. "You have to take proactive steps to balance the scales."      To put that into practice, she said, "At the end of each day, record one or two good things that happened. Take a moment to open a window and simply let the air brush over your skin. Find a way to notice the moment rather than rushing through it to worry about the future."      Don't go it alone   "Some people think about resilience as a Lone Ranger, pull-yourself-up-by- your-bootstraps kind of mindset," Downing said. "What really helps us get through challenging times is having people in our life to help us meet our needs."      Practice   "It's easier to say and harder to do," Rosenberg said. "But it's like any skill. If you want to learn to ride a bike, you have to practice. And you may fall down a lot. You have to pick yourself up and keep trying."      Hang in there   Part of the resilience journey is sometimes just getting through the day, Rosenberg said. "The longer this (pandemic) drags on, the more the uncertainty can weigh us down. But it doesn't mean we're not going to get through it."

THE FACTS: Social media users are sharing data from the World Integrated Trade Solution website to falsely claim that testing kits for COVID-19 were purchased by countries in 2017 and 2018. The erroneous posts are using the data to suggest that the coronavirus is a hoax spread by global leaders. In fact, the data compiled by the website shows previously existing devices that are now being used to fight the coronavirus. The World Bank along with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and several global trade organizations developed World Integrated Trade Solution -- WITS -- software to track information on trade and tariffs. The posts began circulating late last week using screenshots from a page on the WITS website that shows test kit exports by country. At the time the posts were first shared, the website said "COVID-19 Test kits (382200) exports by country" in 2017. The website has since clarified the information on the page to say that "data here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling COVID-19." The World Bank confirmed to the AP that the products were available before COVID-19 for other uses, but have recently been designated to support COVID-19 efforts. In April, the World Customs Organization and the World Health Organization collaborated to create a list of codes to help speed up the movement of medical supplies that could be used to diagnose and treat COVID-19 across borders. Ventilators, which existed long before the coronavirus, were on a June version of that list, according to The World Bank. "It serves as the basis for identifying the cross-border movement of the products needed during the pandemic, applying contingent tariff and non-tariff relief policies, monitoring and combating falsified supplies, and even for taking responsive actions to address shortages," the World Customs Organization said in a statement in April. Some posts linked to a chart showing countries' exports for test kits that rely on polymerase chain reaction testing, PCR. The test kits determine the genetic material of the virus. The tests have been around for more than 30 years. "This has been planned for DECADES!," one Facebook post said, sharing a screenshot of the data. The false posts online were shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter. Some posts even suggest that the World Bank updating the page was a sign that there was a cover up.

After announcing last month that they were no longer accepting aluminum cans, the Kewanee Chamber of Commerce is back in the aluminum business.
   
 Executive Director of the KCOC, Mark Mikenas, said the breakdown of their can crushing machine led the organization to temporarily halt the can collection. The longer their machine was down, the more the cans continued to pile up, said Mikenas.
   
 "They got backlogged," he said. "We had no place to put them."
   
 But with the machine back up and running and the can crushing caught up, Mikenas said the Chamber can once again ask the community to donate their cans to help fund the annual Kewanee fireworks display.
   
 Mikenas said a container, donated by Murphy's Container Service, has once again been placed at the Star Courier parking lot. But Mikenas is requesting that only soda and beer cans be placed in the container.
   
 "Other types of aluminum aren't the same grade. If it's mixed in with the cans, that's what can break down our machine," he said. In addition, other types of aluminum mixed in with the cans could cause a drop in price once it's processed.
   
 The funds from the community aluminum- drive go toward paying a portion of the $11,000 that the Chamber spends on the community Fourth of July fireworks display. Approximately a quarter of the funds comes from the aluminum, while a quarter to a third comes from donations.

And more than anything, everything just felt sad. To clarify, _she_ is not sad, and I don't pity her. That's patronizing.

It's not easy to lose your manager and your husband in one and have to start over in your profession from scratch. It's not easy to be a person of faith and feel like you will emotionally drown if things don't work out as you hope. Now that part I can relate to. And it's not easy doing all the aforementioned while trying to be a parent.

 PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Republican Sen. Susan Collins, Democratic challenger Sara Gideon and a pair of independents are set for the first debate in the U.S. Senate race in Maine.
   
 The debate will be live Friday evening without an audience because of the pandemic.
   
 For now, it's the only scheduled debate. Gideon had suggested five debates while Collins proposed debating in each of Maine's 16 counties.
   
 The two are locked in a tight race as Collins seeks a fifth term and Gideon, Maine's house speaker, tries to help Democrats win control of the Senate.
   
 Independents Max Linn, of Bar Harbor, and Lisa Savage, of Solon, hope to shake up the race. A third independent, Tiffany Bond, is currently in litigation in hopes of having her signatures confirmed to get on the ballot.
   
 The debate is sponsored by NewsCenterMaine, which operates TV stations in Portland and Bangor, along with the Portland Press Herald and Bangor Daily News.

_Saturday, 7/11_. John and I hit the road early and wended our way toward Utah and Colorado. A few hours into our drive, in rural Arizona, we made our first stop to answer nature’s—and caffeine’s—call. As we adjusted our face masks in a Starbucks parking lot, we wondered aloud what kind of reaction we’d get from the anti-maskers who no doubt awaited us inside. To our pleasant surprise, all of the baristas and most of the customers had their faces covered, too. Frustratingly, however, the restrooms were closed. Same with the fast food joint and gas station across the street. Though I understood the logic, it put travelers like us in what you could call an uncomfortable situation. With a shrug and a quick look over our shoulders, we relieved ourselves behind a dumpster in the corner of the parking lot. I’m not proud of what we did, but there didn’t seem to be much choice.

TOULON - A Stark County judge has thrown out some key evidence in a long- running criminal case alleging that a Brimfield truck driver was under the influence of marijuana when an unusual traffic accident claimed the life of a Wyoming woman more than three years ago.
   
 Circuit Judge Bruce Fehrenbacher agreed Friday to suppress blood and urine test results and also statements made to police by defendant Timothy Schwenk soon after the pre-dawn accident that killed 41-year-old Corina Miller on July 11, 2017.
   
 Fehrenbacher granted a defense motion to that effect after finding at a hearing that there was no probable cause for the lab tests and that Schwenk was not advised of his constitutional rights against self-incrimination even though he was effectively in police custody for more than four hours after the accident.
   
 Schwenk was "questioned without being given his Miranda rights," Fehrenbacher said. "There's no evidence that he was given any warnings of any kind."
   
 Schwenk, now 51, was backing a milk tanker truck across both of lanes of traffic into a dairy farm along Illinois Route 17 west of Toulon at 4:42 a.m. that day. Miller, who was driving west, apparently did not see him and drove under the tanker, police said at the time.
   
 Two deputies who responded to the scene, including one who drove Schwenk to a hospital for the lab tests, both testified later that they saw no indication that he was under the influence, according to information presented in court by defense attorney Thomas Dluski. But it's standard department policy to have blood and urine samples taken when accidents involve death or serious injury, they also testified, according to the attorney.
   
 "Nobody had any kind of reasonable suspicion or probable cause," Dluski said.
   
 Schwenk also was taken to the jail, where he was told to write a statement, and he was questioned further there and later at the accident site. He disclosed that he had been going through "a difficult time" and had been "self-medicating" with marijuana, Dluski said.
   
 Schwenk was issued only a citation for the traffic offense of unsafe backing on a roadway that day. But based on statements and lab results showing cannabis, he was later charged with aggravated DUI causing death or serious injury, a felony punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
   
 The prosecution's position is that the statements and lab samples were given voluntarily as he was not under arrest. The policy requiring the lab tests is intended to mirror state statutes, State's Attorney Jim Owens indicated.
   
 Fehrenbacher rejected that argument and agreed with defense contentions.
   
 Obtaining the samples required probable cause and a warrant, and Schwenk was never advised that he had any choice in whether to cooperate, the judge said.
   
 "He was clearly in detention," the judge said. "He wasn't free to go."
   
 Owens requested a transcript of the hearing soon after it ended, suggesting he may intend to seek reconsideration of the ruling. No trial date has been set, but Fehrenbacher scheduled an Oct. 9 case review.
