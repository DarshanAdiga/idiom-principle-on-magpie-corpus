Panipat (Haryana) [India], Jan 8 (ANI): Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala said that the state government will run for the entire five years without any troubles and the people of Haryana had supported the party that was established from scratch.   "I was removed from the party but then we built Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) from scratch, if there was any fault in me then the people of Haryana would not have supported me and my party and made 10 of our candidates win. The ones sitting in the opposition are most likely afraid over the stability in the state government today," Dushyant told reporters on Tuesday.   "We had said right from the very start that we will run the government for the full five-year term," he added.   Dushyant was reacting to the statements issued by the former chief minister, his grandfather and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Om Prakash Chautala who had said that the BJP-JJP led alliance government would soon fall apart in the state.   He had also questioned Dushyant's credibility and asked him to introspect for the reason behind his expulsion from the INLD.   Meanwhile, Dushyant also spoke on the issue of violence on the campus of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) by saying that while everyone was free to protest and raise their voices, it was not okay to take law in their own hands.

WILSON-CAIRNS: Everything's so different. It's just much harder across the board, to be perfectly frank with you (laughs). So the very first thing I did was Google one-shot real-time movie scripts because I didn't even know what structurally how that would look, do you know what I mean? Because I've never read one and I couldn't find one. I couldn't find a single film that was one- shot and in real time that had a script. Well that wasn’t a retroactively written script, which was just dialogue, so I couldn't find one. So I knew there wasn't going to be a lot of dialogue in this film, kind of straight off the bat. And so I was like, "Right. Okay. We're going to have to just work out a new way of doing this."

Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of the world's crude oil travels.
 The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.
 The 5th Fleet "has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region," 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.
 Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard's navy, issued his own warning.
 "Our message to the enemies is to leave the region," Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.
 Separately, Iran summoned the British ambassador over comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the British defense minister about Soleimani's killing, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
 Iran's parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military's command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani's killing as "terrorists," subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be in response to a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a "terrorist organization."
 The U.S. Defense Department used that terror designation to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The action by Iran's parliament was done by a special procedure to speed it into law and also saw the lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million.
 Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for meetings at the United Nations. As the host of the U.N. headquarters, the U.S. is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings.
 "This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people," Zarif said. "But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that."
 Asked about Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists America would comply with its obligations under U.N. rules to grant visas. He then referred to the Iranian diplomat as "a propagandist of the first order."
 A U.S. official who wasn't authorized to speak on the record said the application couldn't be processed in time for Zarif's travel although it wasn't clear if his request had been formally denied. A formal rejection would trigger legal technicalities that could affect future visa applications and could violate the host country agreement the U.S. has with the U.N.

Osseo Area Schools and Brooklyn Park celebrated the opening of the new sports dome Jan. 6 at Park Center High School.
 Officials from the city and school district gathered to speak on the approximately $7.6 million joint-powers project, which was initially approved in spring 2019.
 Both Brooklyn Park Mayor Jeff Lunde and Osseo Area School Board Chair Mike Ostaffe let out their best, “Woo,” à la Ric Flair in celebration of the grand opening.
 “Aren’t you guys excited? C’mon!” Lunde said. “How can you not be in this building? … The fact that we’re in here, we’re talking about something that other schools do not have … I couldn’t be more proud.”
 The project was an easy sell for both the city council and the community at- large.
 “I got zero phone calls. I get phone calls on a $500 expenditure when someone takes a trip, but I got nothing on this. I got lots of phone calls from people who were excited about this investment in the youth … seniors are going to come here and walk around the track––I’m so excited.”
 “This has led to the development of such an outstanding facility, and as the mayor said, ‘Woo,’” Ostaffe said. “This is another great project. We’ve created a tremendous community asset for Brooklyn Park residents, District 279 students, and sports teams from around the area.”
 Along with Lunde and Ostaffe, City Manager Jay Stroebel, Director of Recreation and Parks Jody Yungers, Osseo Area Schools Superintendent Cory McIntyre, and Ron Meyer, executive director of finance and operations for Osseo Area Schools, all offered thanks and comments on the project
 Stroebel said that Ostaffe and Boardmember Tanya Simons helped to bring the city on board with the vision for a dome at Park Center.
 “The physical facility we’ve put together reflects our common commitment to the youth and our community and our willingness to find creative ways to find and make the financial investments that are required,” said McIntyre.
 The partnership will become a model for other cities and schools that want to leverage limited finances, he said.

Iranian state TV said the attack was in revenge for the killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, whose funeral Tuesday in his hometown of Kerman prompted angry calls to avenge his death, which drastically raised tensions in the Middle East.
 Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned the U.S. and its regional allies against retaliating over the missile attack against the Ain Assad air base in Iraq's western Anbar province. The Guard issued the warning via a statement carried by Iran's state-run IRNA news agency.
 "We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted," The Guard said. It also threatened Israel.
 Ain Assad air base is in Iraq's western Anbar province. It was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.
 State TV said the operation's name was "Martyr Soleimani." It said the Guard's aerospace division that controls Iran's missile program launched the attack. Iran said it would release more information later.
 Wednesday's revenge attack came a mere few hours after crowds in Iran mourned Soleimani and as the U.S. continued to reinforce its own positions in the region and warned of an unspecified threat to shipping from Iran in the region's waterways, crucial routes for global energy supplies. U.S. embassies and consulates from Asia to Africa and Europe issued security alerts for Americans. The U.S. Air Force launched a drill with 52 fighter jets in Utah, just days after President Donald Trump threatened to hit 52 sites in Iran.
 A stampede broke out Tuesday at Soleimani's funeral for a top Iranian general slain in a U.S. airstrike, and at least 56 people were killed and more than 200 were injured as thousands thronged the procession, Iranian news reports said.
 Tuesday's deadly stampede took place in Soleimani's hometown of Kerman as his coffin was being borne through the city in southeastern Iran, said Pirhossein Koulivand, head of Iran's emergency medical services.
 There was no information about what set off the crush in the packed streets, and online videos showed only its aftermath: people lying apparently lifeless, their faces covered by clothing, emergency crews performing CPR on the fallen, and onlookers wailing and crying out to God.
 "Unfortunately as a result of the stampede, some of our compatriots have been injured and some have been killed during the funeral processions," Koulivand said, and state TV quoted him as saying that 56 had died and 213 had been injured.
 Soleimani's burial was delayed, with no new time given, because of concerns about the huge crowd at the cemetery, the semi-official ISNA news agency said.
 A procession in Tehran on Monday drew over 1 million people in the Iranian capital, crowding both main avenues and side streets in Tehran. Such mass crowds can prove dangerous. A smaller stampede at the 1989 funeral for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed at least eight people and injured hundreds.
 Hossein Salami, Soleimani's successor as leader of the Revolutionary Guard, addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at the coffin in a central square in Kernan. He vowed to avenge Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday near Baghdad's airport.
 "We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about," Salami said.
 "Death to Israel!" the crowd shouted in response, referring to one of Iran's longtime regional foes.
 Salami praised Soleimani's work, describing him as essential to backing Palestinian groups, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria. As a martyr, Soleimani represented an even greater threat to Iran's enemies, Salami said.
 Soleimani will ultimately be laid to rest between the graves of Enayatollah Talebizadeh and Mohammad Hossein Yousef Elahi, two former Guard comrades killed in Iran's 1980s war with Iraq. They died in Operation Dawn 8, in which Soleimani also took part. It was a 1986 amphibious assault that cut Iraq off from the Persian Gulf and led to the end of the war that killed 1 million.
 The funeral processions in major cities over three days have been an unprecedented honor for Soleimani, seen by Iranians as a national hero for his work leading the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force.
 The U.S. blames him for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country's civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran.
 Soleimani's slaying already has led Tehran to abandon the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers as his successor and others vow to take revenge.
 In Iraq, pro-Iranian factions in parliament have pushed to oust American troops from Iraqi soil following Soleimani's killing. Germany and Canada announced plans to move some of their soldiers in Iraq to neighboring countries.
 According to a report on Tuesday by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, Iran has worked up 13 sets of plans to avenge Soleimani's death. The report quoted Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, as saying that even the weakest among them would be a "historic nightmare" for the U.S. He declined to elaborate,
 "If the U.S. troops do not leave our region voluntarily and upright, we will do something to carry their bodies horizontally out," Shamkhani said.
 The state-run IRNA news agency later published a statement from the Supreme National Security Council denying Shamkhani made the comment.
 The U.S. Maritime Administration warned ships across the Mideast, citing the rising threats. "The Iranian response to this action, if any, is unknown, but there remains the possibility of Iranian action against U.S. maritime interests in the region," it said.
 Oil tankers were targeted in mine attacks last year that the U.S. blamed on Iran. Tehran denied responsibility, although it did seize oil tankers around the crucial Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20 percent of the world's crude oil travels.
 The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said it would work with shippers in the region to minimize any possible threat.
 The 5th Fleet "has and will continue to provide advice to merchant shipping as appropriate regarding recommended security precautions in light of the heightened tensions and threats in the region," 5th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Joshua Frey told The Associated Press.
 Meanwhile, Iranian Gen. Alireza Tabgsiri, the chief of the Guard's navy, issued his own warning.
 "Our message to the enemies is to leave the region," Tabgsiri said, according to ISNA. The Guard routinely has tense encounters with the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.
 Separately, Iran summoned the British ambassador over comments by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the British defense minister about Soleimani's killing, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported.
 Iran's parliament, meanwhile, has passed an urgent bill declaring the U.S. military's command at the Pentagon and those acting on its behalf in Soleimani's killing as "terrorists," subject to Iranian sanctions. The measure appears to be in response to a decision by Trump in April to declare the Revolutionary Guard a "terrorist organization."
 The U.S. Defense Department used that terror designation to support the strike that killed Soleimani. The action by Iran's parliament was done by a special procedure to speed it into law and also saw the lawmakers approve funding for the Quds Force with an additional 200 million euros, or about $224 million.
 Also Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the U.S. had declined to issue him a visa to travel to New York for meetings at the United Nations. As the host of the U.N. headquarters, the U.S. is supposed to allow foreign officials to attend such meetings.
 "This is because they fear someone will go there and tell the truth to the American people," Zarif said. "But they are mistaken. The world is not limited to New York. You can speak with American people from Tehran too and we will do that."
 Asked about Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told journalists America would comply with its obligations under U.N. rules to grant visas. He then referred to the Iranian diplomat as "a propagandist of the first order."
 A U.S. official who wasn't authorized to speak on the record said the application couldn't be processed in time for Zarif's travel although it wasn't clear if his request had been formally denied. A formal rejection would trigger legal technicalities that could affect future visa applications and could violate the host country agreement the U.S. has with the U.N.

Community concerns echo a similar situation last summer, when a group of concerned parents were upset by an under-construction cell tower near Elk Meadow Elementary in southwest Bend.
 Bolken, whose daughter attends fourth grade at Trinity Lutheran, said he was still concerned about radiation despite reading industry experts who said otherwise. He added that more research should be done on the health effects of cell towers.
 “Down the road, I think we’re going to find out that the radiation from these towers is going to be harmful,” he said.
 Not everyone in the area is concerned about the proposed cell tower. Eric Priller’s business, Trigger Happy Guns, is right next to the tower’s planned location. He said he didn’t have a problem with it.
 “I’m OK with it, if it’s not hurting anybody and we’re getting better reception,” Priller said.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KOVR/CNN) – Efforts to drive away the homeless around a McDonald’s by playing bagpipe music are instead driving the neighbors crazy.“The first couple of days they had it on 24/7,” said Arnold Phillips. “If we wouldn’t have said anything or reported it to the police, they would have had that thing going on still.”He lives across the street from the fast-food outlet and says he’s had enough.“It actually penetrates through the walls,” Phillips said. “We can hear it [when] I’m trying to watch TV or whatever and it’s going through that.”Customers at the restaurant weren’t happy either.“It was offensive to me because it was just so annoying,” Susan Smart said.The idea of weaponized sound is nothing new.A 7-Eleven in West Hollywood loops classical music and a 7-Eleven in Sacramento replaced classical with a high pitch tone.But in Sacramento, it’s bagpipes that play over and over again.“It sticks in your head when you’re going somewhere else not even in this neighborhood because you’ve heard it for so long,” Phillips said.Arnold wishes he could pull the plug. He’s talked to restaurant management.So, has Phillips.“They said they’d talk to corporate people up higher,” he said. “That’s all they said they could do really.”Copyright 2020 KOVR via CNN.

SALEM, Ala. (WTVM) - The Lee County Sheriff’s Office is asking for the public’s help in identifying a group of people possibly connected to vandalism at a historic East Alabama cemetery.A chain now hangs across the driveway that leads to the County Line Cemetery on Lee Road 252 in Salem in an effort to stop the stream of vandals they have seen over the years.“Practically every time we’d go out there to fix something and a week or two later, it’d be messed up again,” Talitha Norris, of the Lee County Cemetery Preservation Commission, said.The chain and cameras, both installed about nine months ago, seemed to make a difference for a while, discouraging trespassers and damage to these historic graves. This was until Jan. 1, when several men were caught on camera in the cemetery in the middle of the night.“No one has any business being in a cemetery at two or three in the morning,” Lee County Sheriff Jay Jones said. “They’re probably up to no good and are probably connected to the vandalism that’s occurred there.”Norris said although many may not see the vandalism in that rural cemetery, the hurt runs deep, like the cracks in the headstones, for those who have family members buried there.“Put yourself in the place of somebody that has a relative buried out there,” Norris said. “If it were your grandmother, your mother, father. Would you want their grave vandalized? It’s hurtful to people.”Now the Lee County Sheriff’s Office is asking for your help identifying the group of people in the video.“We want to assure folks, we intend to prosecute them when we identify them and establish they’re responsible,” Sheriff Jones said. "They’ll be charged at the very least with trespassing. They have no business being in that cemetery.Norris said the care of this cemetery should be a concern for everyone.“That’s a statement of our community and the people that have come before us,” she said. “It took them to make us what we are today.”If you have any information the vandalism, you are asked to call the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at 334-749-5651.Copyright 2020 WTVM.

You can see that, through the course of it, he’s gonna warm and thought. What was interesting, which I didn’t know, was his backstory, which we dived into, after I came on board. That actually really helped because there’s a self-loathing that Sidney Parker has. He was indirectly involved in the sugar trade, which was funded by slavery, so he hates himself for that.

Wilson-Cairns was thrilled by the opportunity, obviously, but she admitted in a recent phone interview I conducted with the writer that the first thing she did after initially speaking to Mendes about _1917_ was Google “one-shot movie scripts.” As it turns out, not many exist. That meant that Mendes and Wilson- Cairns had to basically build the form of _1917_ from scratch, feeling their way through the structure of the story (which they conjured in a single afternoon) and then constantly refining the shape of the film all the way up through production. But the nature of the single shot meant that the edit couldn’t be the final rewrite, so it fell on Wilson-Cairns to address any changes or revisions to the script during the rehearsal process and on set, so the camera would be in the correct place for each individual line.

In order to prevent these issues, the versions of games made for consoles like Xbox One, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch, are made to run at a consistent framerate, often 30 or 60 frames per second. (Not every game delivers on that promise, it’s as much about the game itself as the machine.) If these consoles support the adaptive sync found in these TVs, the consoles will be able to run games without those restrictions. Depending on the game, that may lead to smoother, better-looking animation. In others, it may not mean anything.

Why would need a frame rate that changes, you ask? Unlike movies and TV, video games create each frame of animation on the fly. As a result, games tend to be both extremely demanding of computers and finicky about performance changes.
