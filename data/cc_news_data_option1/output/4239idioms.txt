The "Venn diagram" thing is useful, because the intersection between those different feelings is where your story really lives. And often, the more you keep reverting to the middle, the intersection of those different feels, the stronger your sense of tone can be. If most of the time, your tone is a little bit scary and a little bit funny, or a little bit romantic and a little bit sad, then you can more easily go all the way into full-on scariness or romance.

Some of you might object, “Why should I vote? I live in a deeply blue/red state. My vote doesn’t count anyway; it’s not going to change anything.” While it is true that, if you live in a decidedly red/blue state, your individual vote will not change the outcome of the national election, _one vote_ is still infinitely more impactful than zero votes. It’s a choice between having some (albeit small) say and no say at all. Also, while your vote might not flip a red state blue or a blue state red, it will influence _how_ blue or _how_ red your state is — which certainly makes politicians think twice, as it could influence how much they pay attention to the demands of voters not of their own party. Let the nation know that you are there.

Anyone interested in the fate of high school winter sports season will have to wait a few more days for any further information.
   
 But the wait is over for athletes wondering if they can compete for both school and club programs simultaneously this spring and summer..
   
 The Illinois High School Association board of directors met Monday for its regularly scheduled virtual meeting and opted to set up a special meeting for Oct. 28 to announce details about winter sports.
   
 "We understand that student-athletes, coaches, parents, officials, and fans are anxious to learn more details about the plans for IHSA winter sports," IHSA Executive Director Craig Anderson said in a news release.
   
 "We feel like we are making positive strides in our discussions with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to be allowed to conduct IHSA winter sports as scheduled. We believe we have a plan to do so safely and want to provide IDPH with ample time to review the winter sports plans, and supportive data, we have provided them.
   
 "We expect to have a response from IDPH with final recommendations for winter sport plans, including any accommodations and postseason plans, by October 26. We will then reconvene our Board to officially vote and announce that information shortly thereafter."
   
 Currently, the winter sports season is scheduled to begin with practices on Nov. 16 and games starting Nov. 30.
   
 Sports affected include boys and girls basketball, wrestling, boys swimming and diving, cheerleading, dance, boys and girls bowling and girls gymnastics.
   
 Basketball is considered a "medium" IDPH risk, with wrestling, cheerleading and dance labeled at "higher." Swimming and diving, bowling and gymnastics are all considered "lower" risks.
   
 The board also discussed a proposal to postpone wrestling until the summer season. The board plans to take action on that proposal at the special meeting Oct. 28.
   
 The IHSA board also voted to provide a one-time accommodation to the IHSA's independent team by-law, applicable for the the 2020-2021 school year only, granting specific exemptions to only spring and summer season sports.
   
 The winter sports mentioned earlier, which remain in their traditional seasons, will not have an accommodation.
   
 According to the IHSA release, sports competing in the IHSA's 2021 spring season (football, boys soccer, girls volleyball) "will be granted the accommodation to participate simultaneously on school teams and non-school teams throughout the duration of their high school season (Feb. 15-May 1)."
   
 Sports competing in the IHSA's 2021 summer season (baseball, softball, track & field, girls soccer, boys volleyball, lacrosse, boys tennis) "will be granted the accommodation to participate simultaneously on school teams and non-school teams beginning on June 4. The summer season is slated to run from April 19 to June 26."
   
 "The Board determined it was prudent to make modifications to the independent team by-law for the sports that were displaced from their traditional high school season," said Anderson. "They also came up with what we believe is a reasonable compromise for summer sports. The Board is hopeful that the high school teams will be given priority when conflicts occurs.
   
 "We believe making a modification now will allow high school coaches and non- school team coaches to begin communication on how they can collaboratively resolve scheduling conflicts."

Movies about stand-up comics haven't exactly flooded the market or even become known as a genre, but they do pop up now and then. Joaquin Phoenix played a guy who wanted to be one in "Joker." Adam Sandler took Seth Rogen under his wing to make him a better one in "Funny People." Tom Hanks and Sally Field were both looking for the big break on the stand-up stage in "Punchline."      The newest entry is a sweet, simple, low-budget film called "The Opening Act" that's about a young man named Will (Jimmy O. Yang) whose goal in life is to get up in front of crowds and make them laugh.      A sequence at the top previews some nicely streamlined storytelling from writer-director - Stephen Byrne - himself a comic and actor - with a lot going on that doesn't rely on dialogue. There's Will, as a young boy, and his father, laughing together, watching stand-up acts on TV. Their living room setting stays the same, but the film keeps jumping forward in time as they continue watching and laughing (with the boy played by different actors) at the TV over the years. That part poignantly ends with adult Will (Yang) on the couch, still watching, but now alone, not laughing, his father obviously gone.      But his dream of doing what he's been watching is very much alive. The odds are against him. He's well aware that not many people make it in this profession. But when he's not at his day job, sitting in a cubicle, dealing with auto insurance claims for a demanding boss (Bill Burr), he's trying out material at open mic nights. He does get laughs from his audience, but he's only gone as far as a bar & grill in Steubenville, Ohio.      The first step of that dream would be to perform at his first real club. A piece of luck comes his way when more-experienced fellow open mic comic Quinn (Ken Jeong) can't do an out-of-town emcee gig at an improv club, and offers the spot to Will.      There's not a great deal of plotting to deal with here, which makes the film a little loose and more fun to watch. It quickly turns into a slice-of-stand-up comic-life story in which you can just sit back and keep track of Will's triumphs and travails and wonder if he'll beat those odds.      The club, over the border in Pennsylvania, is run by stern and seemingly humorless Chip (Neal Brennan), who reads a low key riot act to novice Will the moment he says hello. Chip's suggestion to Will is that he'd better be funny. The gig incorporates a 12-minute routine as an opener, introducing feature act Chris (Alex Moffat from "SNL"), then introducing headliner Billy G (Cedric "The Entertainer").      Well, Chris is a great comic, but an out-of-control drinker, womanizer, and party guy. Billy G is a star comedian (though Chris considers him to be over the hill) who's kind of an unfriendly cuss to Will, especially when Will screws up his intro.      It's a three-night gig, and the film focuses on the differences between each one of them. Will is understandably nervous, he does well, he has to deal with his first-ever hecklers, he doesn't do well, his loyalty to his loving girlfriend back home is challenged, he wonders if maybe the comedy life "isn't in the cards for me."      Yang gives an amiable, enthusiastic performance, and you do wonder if his Will is just too much of a nice guy to be in this cutthroat business. Jeong, even with limited time here, shows a bit of his wild and crazy side at the microphone. Moffat is terrific at presenting a character who may or may not be out of control. But it's Cedric's scenes - first when his character is unapproachable and later as he offers Will some sage advice about the business - who contributes the finest acting.      The film has a definite charm to it, along with some very funny bits. But it also serves as a cautionary tale. It says, unflinchingly, that making people laugh, even getting the opportunity to try to make people laugh, is not easy.      "The Opening Act" is playing in theaters and is available digitally and On Demand.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.

As CEATEC expects over 200,000 visitors during the event, it has created a robust website capable of handling high volumes of traffic, but there was some difficulty when the server used by visitors during the registration process saw traffic spike to twice the expected load, which made the virtual venue unstable for a few hours, said Shun Yoshida, who manages public relations for the CEATEC Organizing Committee.
 The event may not have opened smoothly, but the problems will serve as a valuable lesson for the organizers in planning future CEATEC events.
 When it first started sounding out exhibitors, in late January, CEATEC had planned to hold the event in-person as usual, but then decided in May to run it fully online.
 Yoshida said the decision was welcomed by many companies because they have established internal guidance encouraging staff to refrain from engaging in large-scale events, and similar activities, because of the virus risk.
 But even at that point, the CEATEC team found they “were already behind schedule, with the organizer and exhibitors having to create an online event that had never done before from scratch,” Yoshida said, adding that they hope to draw on what they have learned this time around when organizing future events.
 Adapting to an online event was a challenge for participating firms, too.

_Barking's Dominic Green on the ball against Harlow Town (Pic: Terry Gilbert)_
 Barking remain at the foot of the Isthmian South Central league table as they crashed to a 3-1 defeat away to Ware despite a bright start.
 Goals from Leigh Rose, Marcus Milner and substitute Reece Crowter sealed the three points for the hosts against the Blues at Wodson Park.
 Justin Gardner’s men moved the ball around the park nicely for the opening 20 minutes with the first real big chance coming from Junior Dadson who fired wide of the target.
 Against the run of play Ware opened the scoring through Leigh Rose after some fantastic build-up play in the final third.
 Moments later the hosts almost doubled their lead as winger Marcus Milner headed over the crossbar from an incoming free-kick from Thomas Bruno.
 In the 37th minute Barking managed to get themselves back into the contest as Junior Luke levelled the score as he picked up a rebound after Ware goalkeeper Calum Kitscha dropped the ball.
 They went into the half-time break tied at 1-1 but it only took two minutes into the second-half for Ware to restore their lead.
 Pacy winger Milner followed up to finish off a rebound as Blues goalkeeper Manny Agboola dropped the ball following a powerful shot from Albert Adu- Donyinah.

 Residents’ responses on their level of satisfaction with the privately-run Given Memorial Library, what services they’d like to see improved or expanded, and the level of financial support they’re willing to provide through either a tax increase or capital campaign were broken down by respondents’ age group, whether or not they’re currently library users and whether or not they have children under age 18.

"The first thing to do is to seperate what's going to happen in 2021 between the pandemic and the possible billion dollar budget shortfall. We can talk about the future but we also need to understand that we're tied to oil and gas at this very moment. Until we are able to diversify the economy, which itself is going to take some shifts and some changes and questioning about who we are as a state like what we bring and tax reforms as well, I think it's important to separate what we do next year from what we do in 10 years. We might not be able to do something in six months, but we can use the next couple years where we're going to be recovering to plan. We can plan to where we have additional successes and we can plan for when we have money. I think we have to understand that we are going to be in the planning phase for the next couple of years while we hold the line or education and ensure that there are as few cuts as possible at the state level. In an ideal world when we're past 2022 and we've recovered, we're looking at the potential for additional revenue to reinvest and diversify education. Teachers are professionals and they need to be treated professionally. That means safe work spaces and excellent pay for our teachers; it means teachers that are nationally board certified and teacher's that have master's degrees need to be compensated for that as well."

CHAMPAIGN -- The Big Ten playing a conference-only schedule makes things tougher this season for Lovie Smith and the Illinois football team.
   
 But it doesn't change how the Illini view their season. Smith, who is entering his fifth year in Champaign, has kept no secret about this group being his best team since taking over the program.
   
 The Illini are 19.5-point underdogs in their season-opener Friday at No. 14 Wisconsin. Illinois' schedule includes perennially tough opponents like No. 5 Ohio State, No. 21 Minnesota and Iowa -- so the Illini likely will be favored only at home against Purdue on Halloween and at Rutgers on Nov. 14.
   
 For Smith, it's hard to believe that his team isn't viewed as having more potential by those outside the program. Illinois is hoping to follow up their Redbox Bowl appearance last year with a winning season this fall. Many on the outside have always doubted what Illinois can attain under Smith, who has been building the program into a much more competitive team in the Big Ten West. But Smith understands that while he and some fans see progression, others' perceptions are less detailed.
   
 "Until we become this consistent winner, this is a position we'll be in quite a few times," Smith said. "It's not at all bad to be the underdog, when people don't have a lot of confidence in what they think you can be. But as I look at our football team, we made progress last year. We were a six-win team, and I think we're a stronger team now."
   
 A year after breaking through for Illinois' first bowl appearance since 2014, Illinois is once again the consensus last-place pick in the Big Ten West, according to 247 Sports, College Football News and a preseason Big Ten media poll.
   
 Virtually every playmaker on the Illini roster is returning for 2020, with the exceptions of running backs Reggie Corbin and Dre Brown (graduated) and Ra'Von Bonner (opted out) and standout linebacker Dele Harding.
   
 "We lot a few guys, but for the most part, our better players are back," Smith said. "And we've added quite a few players, so we're excited about seeing how exactly we fit into the landscape in 2020."
   
 Newcomers like tight ends Luke Ford -- a former top in-state recruit who transferred from Georgia -- and Daniel Imatorbhebhe, who transferred from USC, and wide receviers Brian Hightower (Miami) and Khmari Thompson (Missouri) are "as advertised," Smith said Monday.
   
 Senior quarterback Brandon Peters is aiming to complete a higher percentage of his passses in 2020, after completing 152 of 275 pass attempts (55.2%) last fall. And the new weapons in the passing game, as well as the return of four of five starting offensive lineman, should give Peters the protection and options he needs to progress.
   
 Peters had success in the passing game, throwing for 1,884 yards and 18 touchdowns, though leading receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe -- who caught a team- high nine touchdowns -- went down with a late-season injury that severly limited Peters' options, especially since starting wide receivers Trevon Sidney and Ricky Smalling each suffered season-ending knee injuries.
   
 Offensive coordinator Rod Smith has praised running backs Chase Brown, Mike Epstein and Jakari Norwood, who have each shown promise in their touches as Illini. Epstein is an explosive, jack-of-all-trades back who will likely be the starter if he can stay healthy.
   
 The third-year Illini offensive coordinator favors balance and three running backs in his high-tempo system.
   
 "I want us to be consistent across the board," Rod said. "I want us to be as sound running the football as passing the football, and vice versa."
   
 The Illini also have some positives factors on the defensive end, where 2019 Butkus Award semifinalist Jake Hansen returns at middle linebacker alongside Milo Eifler -- another veteran who can play well in coverage but can also deliver big hits.
   
 Combine that with the return of lockdown cornerback Nate Hobbs and the versatile Tony Adams, who moved back to safety from cornerback before training camp, and Illinois has some elite playmakers in the secondary. There's also depth, with junior Jartavius "Quan" Martin returning and redshirt-freshman cornerback Marquez Beason healthy after rehabiliting from a torn ACL last August.
   
 Illinois has questions along the defensive line, where it must replace Oluwole Betiku (New York Giants) at defensive end and find other sources of disruption along the line after linemen Tymir Oliver, Jamal Milan and Kenyon Jackson graduated.
   
 Without key takeaways, Illinois would certainly not have upset either No. 6 Wisconsin, nor been able to have made a 28-3 comeback to defeat Michigan State and clinch bowl eligibility.
   
 "That's a big part of it right away," Smith said. "Defense has to take the ball away. You can't rely on turnovers. I'll just say that's in our DNA. But just because that's in our DNA doesn't mean it always comes out, but we practice it, we preach it, we live it and I just think in order to play good defensive ball that's a part of it."
   
 Indeed, Illinois ranked third in the FBS with 28 takeaways, which helped make up for allowing 195.5 rushing yards per game and giving up frequent big plays through the air.
   
 Smith has quite the task on hand this fall, guiding a talented, but doubted team through a loaded Big Ten schedule with little room for error. Yet Smith is more confident than ever in his program.
   
 Smith is only 15-34 at Illinois, but he has saw significant dividends pay off down the stretch in 2019, as his team went 4-5 in the Big Ten and reached the postseason after a six-year drought.
   
 Now, with his most experienced and talented team yet, Smith hopes to break through another ceiling and record Illinois' first winning season since 2011 (7-6).
   
 "Just knowing what we're going through, not just right now, for four years," Smith said. "I see the matchup, we were able to beat (Wisconsin) last year. I feel like we're a better football team right now."
   
 Whether anyone else buys into that, however, will depend on what the on-field results show.
   
 "You can do an awful lot of talking about what you are and who you can be, and how good, all those things, but it has to be confirmed," Smith said. "The only way for it to be confirmed is to get a win against good people.
   
 "We were able to get some big wins last year, so yes, winning gives you confidence. It works if we do it the right way, if we work hard, buy into it, have each others' backs, play hard and do all the things that we continue to preach. So, yes, last year we took a step, but they don't take that record over. We start again."

"Once you see fear in a firefighter's eyes," Ryan Montano says, "that's when you know things aren't good."
 When they moved here seven years ago, the Montanos loved the views of grassy hillsides and oak trees. The possibility of wildfire didn't occur to them. After wildfires struck other parts of California in recent years, they considered what to take with them if one hit, but they didn't expect a fire to overrun their home and strip everything away.
 "We had a good preparation plan for evacuation, but you can prepare to only take so much," Ryan Montano says. "You can't just throw your house on the back of a truck and go."
 The Montanos are among millions of people in the West who move into fire-prone landscapes without getting any warning about that risk from the government, real estate agents or sellers. Almost 60 million homes were within less than a mile of a wildfire between 1992 and 2015. And those numbers only continue to grow as climate change increases the risk of bigger, more frequent blazes in the American West.

I don’t think Nynaeve’s ambitions as a Healer will ever be sated; perhaps she will be the one who finds a way to cure the madness of the taint on _saidin_ , or to figure out a way to shield someone against it. After all, we know that the Dark One provides a protection against the taint for his own male followers. And we know that the _saidin_ in the Eye of the World was somehow filtered by the men and women who created it. Perhaps that skill will be rediscovered by Nynaeve or Egwene or Elayne. Perhaps one or all of the girls will learn how to link with Rand and work in tandem channeling both _saidar_ and _saidin_ at the same time. What might they accomplish then? What old weaves might they rediscover? What new weaves might they create?

For me, as a reporter covering the Niagara County Legislature back in the late 2000s, Al was one the people who could often be counted on to add pizzazz to an otherwise mundane meeting. He was usually good for a colorful quote or two, which I always appreciated.
 Don't think that because I covered him and quoted him that Al let me off the hook where his pointed criticisms were concerned. Like holding politicians accountable, Al wasn't shy about reminding the members of the media to do their jobs as well.
 I don't recall him ever being particularly critical of me or my work, but I wouldn't take offense anyway because I knew, very often, Al generally knew what he was talking about.
 There was a time when Al was a regular caller into local AM talk radio shows, including "Viewpoint" on what is now known as WEBR AM 1440. He wasn't one to pull punches on the air, either, and he was always good for a funny line or two. I know many other callers enjoyed listening to Al and appreciated his feisty nature.
 I count myself among Al's legion of fans.
 In the end, I always got the impression that Al wanted what many of the rest of us want and that's honest representation in government, reasonable taxes, dependable services and the sort of leadership that can help make a community a great place to live and work.
 The fact that Al complained so often and so much is a testament to just how far off the mark Niagara County has been for so long where such things are concerned.
 Al did his best to keep the powers-that-be honest and for that he should be remembered fondly by his fellow taxpayers and voters, many of whom are not as bold or as willing to tell the people in charge just how they truly feel.

Dorothy Dutton, the town clerk, told commissioners that marching bands from both Union Pines High and New Century Middle schools are unlikely to be available for the parade. She said the Southern Pines Business Association, the organization that oversees the larger Christmas parade in that town, has received only two applications for this year’s event.
 “Even if we have the parade, there still might not be a lot of participation,” Dutton said.
 Had the board decided to proceed with the parade, Dutton said the town would be required by the Moore County Health Department to enforce social distancing guidelines and make hand sanitizer available along the parade route.
 “There’s quite a bit we would have to do, and we would have to provide the health department with an action plan before we could do it,” she said.
 Following a motion by Commissioner Christopher Nance, the board unanimously voted to cancel the parade.

Earlier this year, the village hired national library consultants LibraryIQ and Clearscapes to assess Pinehurst’s library needs through a survey and series of public meetings and stakeholder interviews. A preliminary report presented to the Village Council in April suggested a facility between 14,000 and 20,000 square feet that could cost $5-8 million to build and more than $1 million to operate annually.
 Responses from the latest survey conducted over the summer will help the village scale down from that prospect, but also offer some conflicting feedback that the Village Council will have to parse through before pursuing any action.
 Of those who responded to the survey, 65 percent felt either “strongly” or “somewhat” that Given Memorial Library meets the needs of village residents as it is. About 34 percent feel that the privately-owned library is inadequate for Pinehurst’s current needs.
 Assistant Village Manager Natalie Hawkins said that a dissatisfaction threshold of 20 percent is typically considered enough of a red flag to spur reevaluation of current programs and services.
 But at the $1 million projection for annual operating costs, Pinehurst would have to raise its property tax rate three cents to support a library with entirely new revenue. Only 27 percent of survey respondents would be willing to see more than a one-cent increase.
 But with more than half of those who responded willing to pay some level of higher taxes for expanded library services, most council members are ready to evaluate options and give weight to the needs of younger residents. Pinehurst’s new community center at Cannon Park is also likely to be a factor in that discussion.
 “Certainly they took us to task for not thinking about the library when we thought about the community center. I think definitely we’ve got to think about doing this for the future, more than 10 years out. More like 20 years out,” said Councilwoman Judy Davis.
 “At the end of the day, people are not going to jump up and down for a property tax increase and there also may be other ways to do it, like a flat fee … or library tax. I think there was very enthusiastic support, more than I really expected, for a public library.”
 In any case, leaders of Given Memorial Library, who are also responsible for the Tufts Archives in the same building on the Village Green, have said that their organization doesn’t have the financial support to continue its current operations. Pinehurst currently contributes $150,000 each year toward Given Memorial Library operations.
 Given-Tufts offered its library collection and about $1 million of its endowment to Pinehurst earlier this year to be put towards a municipal library, but the Village Council has yet to discuss that offer. About 6,000 of the Given library’s 8,000 registered cardholders live in the village.
 Despite the majority who are satisfied with the services Given Memorial provides to village residents, 70 percent of residents who responded also said that expansions of the digital media offerings, children’s book and media collections, and adult book and media collections are either “moderately,” “very,” or “extremely” needed.
 A similar proportion also agree that the library needs extended weekday evening and Saturday hours. As opposed to the survey conducted earlier this year, the most recent survey asked for respondents’ perception of what services and capabilities are needed rather than the ones they would personally be likely to utilize.
 Residents aged 65 and over were overrepresented in the survey sample relative to the village’s overall population, as were respondents without children.
 “We are a growing community. Our population is increasing and has consistently increased over the last several years, and in addition to that we are seeing a shift in our demographics to a younger demographic,” said Hawkins.

We even disagree about whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich. Despite all of these differences, however, we _can_ agree on the importance of upholding democracy, on the founding principle that the government derives its power from the consent of the governed. The most fundamental way of exercising your own power in the runnings of this country is voting. So this November, if you do nothing else outside of binging Netflix and wondering how we arrived at the apocalypse, vote. Vote like your life depends on it — because our lives _do_ depend on the policies enacted by the people whom we vote into office.

The mask mandate’s fate was determined after council members debated multiple motions and proposals, including changing the ordinance language to state that the council simply encouraged mask usage. At one point, visibly frustrated council members adjourned for five minutes and some walked into an adjacent room to talk. When the meeting began again, there was still confusion among councilmen about whether they were voting for an amendment to a motion or a motion itself.
 The end result was the council did not extend the mask mandate and did not create a new mandate to replace the expiring one.
 "You have to wear a mask just about everywhere you go," Horry County Council Chairman Johnny Gardner said. "The problem that you’re seeing is that some of the people aren’t wearing it right. A lot of people are tired of wearing it; they don’t think it's working. And I don’t want to get bogged down into the math or the science about it because there are so many people saying one thing and so many saying the other. It's just that the county council decided enough was enough."
 Under the policy that will end this month, people entering businesses are required to wear face coverings while inside those establishments. Masks may be removed to receive certain services, such as a haircut, or for someone to eat a meal at a restaurant.
 Restaurants and retail stores must also require their employees to wear masks, and the ordinance also applies to personal care providers such as nail salons, tattoo parlors and barber shops.
 Violating the policy is a civil infraction punishable by a $25 fine for the first offense, $50 for a second offense and $100 for all subsequent violations. The ordinance states that each day of not wearing a mask is considered a separate offense.
 The proposal on Tuesday’s agenda was to create a new emergency ordinance that included the same mask mandate. An emergency ordinance requires a two-thirds majority of council to pass (eight votes). In recent weeks, the mask mandate has received support from seven council members: Worley, Bill Howard, Dennis DiSabato, Tyler Servant, Gary Loftus, Orton Bellamy and Cam Crawford. Councilmen Johnny Vaught, Paul Prince, Al Allen, Danny Hardee and Gardner have wanted to end the mask rules.
 “I have a problem with continuing this state of emergency in Horry County,” Vaught said Tuesday. “Because I don’t think a state of emergency continues to exist.”
 State health officials have credited mask ordinances with slowing the spread of the virus.

 The Constitution does not dictate when national elections take place; that is the duty of Congress.

Because the nation was mostly rural and, by November, the crops were all harvested and farmers had time to travel miles on horseback to vote.

This is not just the first full-on war in the time of COVID-19. What non- Armenians, non-Greeks, non-Kurds, non-Assyrians and non-Yazidis are still having a hard time processing is the century-old threat of the neo-Ottoman Pan-Turkism agenda that is festering steadily in these two republics that have all but decimated any voices of progressive opposition. Turkey’s left is silent because of the guaranteed blowback and persecution they will receive. Add to that, Recep Tayyip Erdogan making public statements such as Hitler’s Germany was efficient and that Turkey will carry out what their grandfathers started in the Caucasus, alluding to the Genocide. Since when have leaders of nations been held accountable for their vitriolic threats? And is accountability even a realistic demand in these apathetic and fictitious times?      Armenia is being pushed into the corner of an ugly realpolitik powder keg, spearheaded by Russia that does not want to “lose” Turkey and its strategic importance to their respective geopolitical interests. Mr. Putin has played the long game. Mr. Lavrov is his sphinx bishop on the chessboard. The real estate of high-tech arms trade is vital to any superpower or empire’s longevity. The divide must not be settled. It must linger if profits are to be waged through the arms trade to Armenia and Azerbaijan. Israel’s overt snuggling to Azerbaijan’s oil pot is a tragic example of war profiteering in the several billions paid. No matter how loud and vocal the Israeli protests in favor of stopping arms sales to Azerbaijan, the ugly truth remains etched in the blood of civilians and fresh graves caused by Israeli-made drones.      Whatever we have learned as Armenians over the past century has tragically come to haunt us in these vicious and united days. We are alone…again. With only fortitude, wherewithal and absolute blindly driven stubbornness to survive, this war demands that all of us GET BETTER. Think smarter and have foresight in all we do during wartime and after.      When Icarus smashed into the sea after daring the sun, the plowman tilled, the villager plucked his garden and the rest of the land didn’t see, didn’t care and didn’t remember just like our world today in this war. Aside from the lone conscientious souls in a few parliaments, civil society, sporadic academia and media who post, tweet, write letters and demand attention to the gross inhumanity taking place, we have only our willpower and presence of mind to rely on. Nobody cares that we are the first Christian nation. Nobody cares that we endured the first large scale Genocide of the 20th century. If history has taught us anything, it is that historical amnesia’s first casualties are victims. This is why we must be victorious. After two-thousand years of Armenia enduring and surviving conquests by the Persians, Mongols, Ottomans and Russians, guess what?

“They were very instrumental in saving my life,” Ford said, referring to Van Loon and Cuadrado.
 Soon she began having hives caused by ammonia when her body didn’t expel it correctly and it went to her brain. This caused her to start passing out frequently.
 “I continued to feel bad. I started getting jaundice. My eyes were yellow, and I just apparently looked awful because people told me afterwords they couldn’t believe how bad I looked,” Ford said.
 As her enzymes continued to rise, her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score remained around 12. The MELD number is a scoring system from 6-40, ranking the level of sickness to determine who may receive a liver transplant. To receive a transplant, a person’s MELD score must be 18 or higher.
 In October 2010, Ford’s level had risen to 18, but with no liver available. “I just kept getting worse. I kept passing out more and more. And just not functioning. I didn’t do anything. I just laid all day long because I was so weak and couldn’t function,” she said.
 While sitting at the hospital in Memphis, her doctors told her there was nothing else they could do for her. “You’ve taken all the medicine that we know of for this, and you have to have a new liver,” they said.
 That was a Tuesday.

The Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) has come under fire from a host of critics demanding the institution cancel its imminent sale of three major works in an attempt to raise money to support curatorial and staff salaries and to purchase supplies to be used in the care of the museum's holdings. Slated to be deaccessioned on October 28 through Sotheby's are Brice Marden's _3_ , 1987; Clyfford Still's _1957-G_ , painted during the eponymous year; and Andy Warhol's _The Last Supper_ , 1986. Together, the works are expected to fetch some $65 million.
 Among critics' allegations are that the museum secretly sold the Warhol work at a tremendous discount; that the deaccessioning of the works does not fall within the guidelines established by the American Alliance of Museums; that the loss of the works will leave a gap in the institution's collection; and that BMA director Christopher Bedford introduced a conflict of interest in asking the museum's curatorial team to vote on a plan that would directly enrich them. Of note also is the museum's decision to deaccession a work by a living artist--in this case, Marden--a highly irregular move.
 To date, two separate open letters calling for the sale's cancellation have been penned. The first, delivered to Maryland's attorney general and secretary of state on October 14 and described in the _Los Angeles Times_ as "blistering and closely argued," was collectively written by twenty-three prominent supporters of the museum and has since gained some 150 signatures, most recently those of art historian Michael Fried, former Baltimore Museum of Art (BMA) director Arnold Lehman, and former board member Stiles Colwill, who quit over the decision to sell the works. The second, addressed to the BMA board of trustees, arrived on October 19 and was written by former board member Laurence Eisenstein, who led the charge in writing the October 14 missive.
 Among those in the media demanding the sale's cancellation is Pulitzer Prize- winning critic Christopher Knight, whose scorching op-ed--headlined "Baltimore Museum of Art Uses Covid as Cover to Sell a Warhol. Floodgates Open"--was published in the _LA Times_ this week. _Artforum_ has reached out to the BMA for comment on the issue.
 In an article published in _The Art Newspaper_last week, BMA curators Asma Naeem and Katy Siegel defended the sale against those who "consider only those artists already anointed by market value," and emphasized the opportunity the deaccession would provide to diversify the museum's collection and better compensate its staff. "Museums are not mausoleums or treasure houses," they wrote. "They are living organisms, oriented to the present as well as the past, and that is where the fundamental disagreement lies."

In response to an inquiry from Pincher Creek RCMP Sgt. Ryan Hodge about a meeting opportunity with K Division on October 29 and 30, Municipal District (M.D.) councillors expressed that they were not ready to discuss their concerns during the October 13 council meeting.
 The meeting with K Division would take place during a Rural Municipalities of Alberta (RMA) Community Meeting session on Zoom, however council voted unanimously to accept Hodge's e-mail as information at this time.
 M.D. council will be meeting with the commanders of the Crowsnest Pass and Pincher Creek detachments in November, and councillors agreed it should take place before speaking to K Division.
 Reeve Brian Hammond said the meeting was necessary to understand what challenges both detachments face, and how effectively they can address rural crime.
 "Let's get some local insight into what some of the challenges are, and how they see this conversation--have it with superior officers so they can be improved," said Reeve Brian Hammond.
 "I don't think we're in the place where we can deal with the issue being raised. I think we do need to deal with it, but I'd like to get something from those two folks that are the key players in the local area," he said.
 "Get a perspective from that point of view, and then we can always schedule a meeting with K Division, especially if it's urgent."
 CAO Troy MacCulloch said other rural municipalities will most likely be taking the opportunity to bring up similar concerns about rural crime as the M.D. would at the RMA meeting.
 "They're probably going to hear rural crime anyway from a number of people, and that's our number one priority."
 He added that a discussion with both detachments would foster better engagement with the M.D.
 "I haven't engaged the Crowsnest detachment the way we've engaged the Pincher one, because there's an assumption that… if I need to get anything to the Crowsnest detachment it will be forwarded. That hasn't been happening," said MacCulloch.
 "Now we've taken the step and we're going to invite them here so that we have the same engagement with Crowsnest that we have with Pincher," he said.
 "Plus, having the two detachment commanders would help us work on our communication with the public. That should be a great leap."
 Boundaries were cited as one definite subject of concern during the discussion, and MacCulloch told council that he had expressed that with Roland Milligan, Director of Development and Community Services, through an RMA survey.
 "(Milligan) and I did the RMA rural crime survey, and they said 'is there anything you would like to bring forward.' That was the number one thing we put--multiple detachments within one municipal boundary is not recommended," he said.
 "The boundaries are decided in Edmonton. Crowsnest (police) go all the way up to Ranchland."
 Reeve Hammond said it should be one of the topics that are addressed in meetings with police.
 "If they're okay with that, that's fine. If we're not okay with that, that's something different, and I'd like to have that conversation," said Hammond.
 Still, MacCulloch pointed out that there may be other concerns that should be investigated first, including how Crowsnest Pass and Pincher Creek police engage each other.
 "My concern is that, if we have an issue out in Burmis Heights. If somebody calls from there, Crowsnest responds, but if we receive the phone call here, our natural inclination is to send Pincher," said MacCulloch.
 "We have to make sure that if there was an incident there on Wednesday and Crowsnest responded, that the Pincher guys we call are aware that they're walking into a situation the next day," he said.
 "We just want to make sure that they have a mechanism in place. If it's there, wonderful."

Penelope-Ann "Penny" (Thomson) McCulloch, 83, of Weymouth, passed quietly on September 30, 2020. An avid artist, teacher, and overall nurturing personality, Mrs. McCulloch was the only child of Capt. Gerald W. and Alice C. (Holt) Thomson. Penny was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, in 1937, while her father was stationed at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. During early childhood her father was stationed in both Pascagoula, Mississippi, and Brooklyn, New York, but by 1948 they had settled in Hingham. Upon graduating from the High Mowing School (Wilton, NH), Penelope began her formal education in Art at the Rhode Island School of Design (Providence, RI). She graduated as a sculpture major with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1960. Penny's mother instilled in her the philosophy that life is an adventure, and her own joie de vivre gave her the means to pass this idea to her children. She taught her two sons to be creative individuals and combined the concerns of a parent with the motivations of a teacher, bringing her to a commitment in the educational field. In 1976, she completed a master's degree program from Suffolk University in Elementary Education.

My oldest granddaughter is working toward her masters to be a high school teacher. She is very active in her desire for Democratic victory and defeat of this president. I am very proud of her. My youngest grandson who is 10 years younger seemed surprised when he learned I did not want this president to win anything, possibly because I’m an old white guy. I am very proud of him.
 Politics in general is often discouraging, but essential. I will vote a straight Democratic ticket this time, which is different than usual, as I often cross party lines, voting not on issues as much as character. At this time I feel the other party has lost its way from blindly following their leader in all issues, but that is my own opinion. I don’t expect our president to be of huge moral character, but I do expect to hear the truth at least once in awhile.
 A neighbor down the road has a large Trump sign in their yard. I have a small Biden sign in mine.

 “I perform better in a classroom surrounded by vibrant discussion.” …
 “I would much, much, much, much rather have in-person classes.” …
 “It’s all busy work and anxiety-inducing. We’re not learning anything.” …
 “I am currently living in an off-campus apartment with one other roommate, and I feel very isolated.” …
 “Definitely in-person, so I can see the cute boys in real life.”
 Real life, you say. Hmm. Wonder what that’s like.

1One Texas-Sized Loophole is Letting Lone Star Polluters Off the Hook

Many children and families have passed through the red doors at 2625 Broadway, where the little ones are called “friends” and cared for by a devoted group of workers — several of whom have been there for decades. Children of varying ages do planned activities while picking up social skills and education in a learning environment that’s geared toward them.
 “We have a percentage of our day that is child directed,” Knight explained. “We have a percentage of our day that is teacher directed, but we serve all meals and snacks.”
 Knight and her longtime co-worker, assistant coordinator Brenda Bradford, looked back Tuesday with The Sun, in recognition of the licensed child care center’s 40th anniversary.
 It opened as Western Baptist Hospital Daycare back on Oct. 21, 1980, in a location across from G&O Pharmacy, according to Bradford. It moved and changed names over the years, while the current building was dedicated in May 1993. All these years later, the Child Development Center remains here to take care of children and help support families.
 It’s an accomplishment that makes Bradford “extremely proud,” as it’s weathered the years and different situations, such as the Ice Storm of 2009, and more recently, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
 “I can’t imagine myself anywhere else,” she said. “I really can not imagine myself being any place else, but here.”
 A former beautician, Bradford recalled applying for a job thanks to encouragement from her late friend, Kathleen Johnson, who also worked at the center. She started 40 years ago as a part-timer working with babies — a job she enjoyed. It quickly turned into a full-time role, and the rest is history. She’s been there ever since.

In the darkness and the horrible losses of the brave, bright young men and women fighting tooth-and-nail for Artsakh and Armenia’s survival, there is only one irreversible fact on the ground today: no amount of firepower, high- tech or otherwise in the hands of cowardly ragtag armies and sophisticated weaponry will ever come a hair’s breadth to achieving the impossible surrender of Armenia. The cost and consequences are beyond brutal, but the victory will not be Pyrrhic.      In the end, the calls for justice will continue in the halls of power, and celebrities will advocate for us then retract their support when the bots and trolls of Azerbaijan target their businesses and public image. All that will matter is the one less hour we sleep and devote to wholehearted action, aid and total mobilization for the very same survival that we have etched in our souls for millennia. There is no other way but allowing this darkness to become the purpose to finding the light.      The storm is now and forever in us. We will ride this one out too. For over a century we have been painted as ‘victims’ of one of the first genocides of the 20th century—the “starving Armenians” plastered all over American print and media. Finally, the pendulum swung in the first Nagorno-Karabakh war. We emerged victorious. For once in a long time, the world saw that when cornered into yet again the iron maiden of a nation’s annihilation, the only choice we have is victory, by any means necessary. Again, the harsh cost for our tiny country is too great. The former “victims” are now the victors just by the mere stubbornness and fight for their patch, no different than Sparta, no different than any fabled underdog tale.      This war will temporarily end when Russia intervenes. All else is window dressing and lip service. Artsakh will survive thanks to the indefinable courage and absolute dedication of our soldiers bearing the cost of this with their lives – young, old, men, women, elderly. What Armenia and Artsakh will need more than ever now and every day after tomorrow is our presence in the war after the bombs stop to rebuild, sustain and return to the root. The ghosts and scars of this war will remain for a while. They will only fuel each survivor and Armenians urge to dig deeper, plant firmer and blossom more garlands where children will nurture and grow, far from the chaos of our times. The only light that will break the isolation and cruel indifference of the world is our total, invincible unity and sustainable lifelong commitment to survive, rebuild, nurture and contribute every day to the survival of Artsakh and Armenia.

Now part-time again, Bradford has worked in different capacities, including the front office and in billing. She’s seen many changes throughout the past 40 years, but some things stay the same.
 “I’ve always said we have more fun than anybody,” she said with emotion. “... Because we get to play with children and teach children and love children all day long.”
 It’s a sentiment echoed by Knight, who’s been an employee for 27 years and director for 12 years. There’s something different every day.
 “My husband always says, you know, he’ll say, ‘Oh, what are you going to do today?’ ” she added. “’I have no idea, but I can’t wait to get there and find out.’ ”
 It’s something the center tells people when they’re interviewing.
 “You’ve got to be flexible because you may start out — you have this great lesson plan,” Knight said. “You’re going to talk about pumpkins and it’s going to be wonderful and then somebody gets a new puppy and that pumpkin — you’re going to talk about puppies. That’s just over.”
 Her favorite part is being involved in the lives of families.
 “We’ve been through so much with families,” she said.
 “They come straight to us. They come straight to us. We’re their safe place and this is where they come. A lot of times we’re the first face they see after they’ve had a bad day at work ... This is where they come and just come on in. There’s no paperwork that’s more important than them. If they have a problem, then come on in and we’ll take care of it.”
 With COVID-19, the center’s 40th anniversary celebration will be a little different than planned, but the big milestone will still be marked with a socially distant dinner, where employees reminisce and talk about old times.

I'll often find that my earlier drafts go so wrong, in terms of tone, that it's pushed the story into a direction that I didn't really intend for it to go. A scene that should have been tender was spiky and angry, or a dramatic confrontation fell flat, and this meant that every scene that came afterward was heading in the wrong direction. All too often, when a story has gone off the rails, it's nothing to do with plot problems or character problems, per se—it's that I've veered off into a tone that doesn't serve the story I'm trying to tell.

For landmarks, and memorable spots, let us begin with Lynch Park. This beautiful 16-acre property abutting the Atlantic Ocean is arguably one of the most enjoyable public places to take your family in all of Massachusetts. We have the North Shore Music Theatre, the Cabot Cinema and the Larcom Theatre for entertainment. We are home to Endicott College and the Montserrat School of Art.
 Over the past 20 years, all our elementary schools received a facelift, and we built a new middle school and high school. Thousands of employees travel to the Cummings Center each day. Thank you, Bill Scanlon, for taking the best gamble in this city’s history when you sold the old Shoe/Black & Decker complex to Bill Cummings. The Cummings Center has truly transformed downtown Beverly into a thriving place for local shops and restaurants. The downtown transformation and T parking garage do not happen without the incredible rise of this office complex over the past 30 plus years. We are in the process of building a long overdue police station at the Cummings Center for our men and woman in blue.
 Beverly has the only regional airport on the North Shore and Cape Ann. We have four supermarkets, if you include the recently added Whole Foods. As daunting as the roundabout seemed when it broke ground on Brimbal Avenue, it is now a welcome solution to a traffic problem that existed long before the shopping plaza opened. There are five train stations with final destinations of Rockport, Newburyport and, of course, the city of Boston.

Canadian-born multidisciplinary artist Kapwani Kiwanga has won the prestigious Prix Marcel Duchamp for her sculptural series "Flowers for Africa," which addresses African independence. The $41,000 prize, France's top art honor, is awarded by the Association for the International Dissemination of French Art (ADIAF).
 Kiwanga, who lives in Paris, studied anthropology, and often brings her training in this field to bear on her work, which among other media encompasses photography, film, installation, and sculpture, often in the service of amplifying the legacies of colonialism. "Flowers for Africa," which she began in 2013 while living in Dakar, Senegal, re-creates floral arrangements appearing at various diplomatic events associated with freedom ceremonies throughout the titular continent. To make the works--of which there are fifty-four, one for each African country--Kiwanga carefully notes the construction of the floral arrangements present at each event, then commissions a professional florist to re-create the arrangements based on archival photographs. These often-massive bouquets are displayed upon plinths and wilt over the course of an exhibition, evoking the tradition of the _vanitas_.
 "It was important for me not to do a work about monuments or commemoration but for it to embrace the idea of change and reinterpretation. I try with my artworks to propose 'exit strategies': new ways of thinking, embracing this flux and wilting, asking for complexity and to make an invitation to think about these past moments," Kiwanga told _The Art Newspaper_ _._
 "The richness and complexity of Kapwani Kiwanga's project, bordering on a reflection between anthropology and art, opens up a vast poetic and political program, a true laboratory of today's thought on memory and archives as sources of the world's transfiguration," said Bernard Blistène, director of the Centre Pompidou and chair of the prize jury, in a statement.
 An exhibition of work by Kiwanga and this year's prize nominees--Alice Anderson, Hicham Berrada, and Enrique Ramirez--as well as that by previous prizewinners is on view at the Pompidou through January 4, 2021.

"From a regional comparison, we see some success from the last couple of years. I think we have all seen public education improve slightly, but it doesn't undo the damage because we still had 31-percent of a budget cut to public education since 2018. That's not even including higher education. There is a 25 to 28-percent budget cut to higher education. It's not much better there at all. That brings up the broken teacher pipeline. If we're not good now we're just going to get worse down the road because we are not going to have the right personnel to be able to get kids educated the way we need them to be. We need more university trained educators. I think there are people working really hard to work with what they've got. I think the legislature keeps punting the issue because it is not politically expedient unless you have the power of a teacher walk out like we saw in 2018 when it did become a top issue. For the past 10 to 12 years, we haven't seen any positive shifts so we continue to decrease nationally and regionally."

The Benoit family tragedy was widely covered and controversial to say the least. A lot of mainstream media outlets were covering the story and bringing a ton of eyes to the situation and the professional wrestling world. As a result, the topic of CTE and the dangers of concussions turned the wrestling world upside down.
 Arn recalled the added pressure from the outside world, and mentioned that the scariest thing about the entire ordeal is that there wasn't a single person who saw any warning signs about what was to come.
 "It certainly helped put a spotlight on it," Arn said. "It sure did. I would just say this about Chris - ask any wrestler that's ever spent any time in the locker room with him. Any time on the road with him, any time in the ring with him. Nobody saw this coming. That's what makes it so scary. There were no warning signs that any of us saw.
 "The last time I saw him, he was as kind and as professional as he was the first time I saw him," Arn recalled. "So, to say there were warning signs that were ignored-- now, I'm talking about in our world. I'm not talking about when he went home or anything like that in the confines of his home. His home and his family life we don't know about, but the times I saw him, there were no indicators, which makes it so scary."
