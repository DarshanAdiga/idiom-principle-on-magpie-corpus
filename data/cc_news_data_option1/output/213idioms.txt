A master plan to redevelop St. Joseph’s riverfront through a number of projects could see its first work after a Tourism Commission decision last week.
 The Commission voted to recommend two projects to the City Council in order begin the long-term process of turning the area into a tourist destination.
 The first would involve the creation of a pedestrian trail on the bluffs east of the river, north of Huston Wyeth Park.

“We went through a little bit of a dry spell offensively, but at the same time we were allowing them to score on pretty much every possession,” Belcher said. “So we weren’t getting stops on one end, and weren’t converting on the other, and you just saw the lead balloon and balloon and balloon. We couldn’t stop the bleeding, so to speak.”
 More than just insufficient effort, senior guard Malique Bennett put the blame for their less than stellar performance on a night of less than stellar fundamentals.
 “It was a finishing problem, we couldn’t finish. Next time we’ve gotta practice more and get more shots up, make more shots and be consistent.”
 After at one point trailing by 15 points in the middle of the third quarter, a pair of successive three-point shots from sophomore forward Allan Coy freed the Cardinals from the rut.
 Coy led the Cardinals with 15 points.
 Benton came up with a few steals converted into fast break points in the fourth quarter to help turn the tide in their favor and make it a one score game.
 From there, however, the magic ran out. Smart decision-making against the press gave the Mavericks breathing room, and they rode home with a hard-fought victory.
 “Very proud of how we battled back in the second half, I thought our energy and effort level was through the roof,” Belcher said. “We got it down to two, we’d climbed the mountain, but we couldn’t get over the hill.”
 Bennett noted that the team’s impressive early season record has put something of a target on the Cardinal’s backs, something he believes they still have yet to fully adjust to.

Jack Shelton died last month. I will pause while you Google who he was.
   
 The singer-trumpeter-actor-comedian was probably best known for his work with Merv Griffin and that ABC Saturday morning staple, "Schoolhouse Rock."
   
 Raise your hand if you remember "Conjunction Junction" and those other ditties that educated and entertained you as a child and now songlock-torture you for hours whenever you read or hear a word or two featured in those little annoying nuggets.
   
 One of the most famous of those skits was "I'm Just a Bill" that was designed to teach kids how government works. Shelton sang in that and played the voice of the bill. "I'm just a bill, oh yeah, I'm only a bill, and if they vote for me on Capitol Hill ..."
   
 In a nutshell, the segment explained how legislation becomes law in Washington. Ol' Bill was presented to both the House and Senate, which passed him unanimously, and then went to the White House where the president signed him without hesitation.
   
 Yeah, right.
   
 Perhaps in the mind of a 1970s 8-year-old sugared up from all that frosted cereal and slam-dancing to the little ditty, that is how government is supposed to work. But fast-forward to today and try to get something like that on TV now. The process is not that simple anymore.
   
 First of all, "Schoolhouse Rock" would have to be expanded from a little 5-minute segment to upward of 30 minutes or longer in order to cover how legislation really gets through. And it is far more than just an idea-draft- vote-approve-sign-law procedure now.
   
 If "I'm Just a Bill" were to be produced in today's turbulent political climate, it might look something like this:
   
 First, the concept would have to run through social media to determine if it is actually worth pursuing. After that, a robocall blast would go out to a cross-section of the representative's constituents to take their temperature on it.
   
 Colleagues opine about its strengths and weakness on the morning talk shows, and party leadership takes part in a "CNN Town Hall" to gauge how it will affect the party's standing in terms of strengthening their stronghold.
   
 If you're lucky, someone like the president of the United States will tweet about it, sending even more voters into their respective political corners.
   
 And that is all before the bill is even introduced. Once it is drafted, a whole new process kicks in.
   
 The representatives do a little horse trading and back scratching to make sure the bill gets before the "right" committee, all the time praying for a preferred placement on the agenda. More robocalls, Facebook posts, tweets and sound bites follow.
   
 Three months later, the committee takes up the bill, already knowing its fate. That sucker is either dying there or it will be sent to the full chamber for an even more public fate. C-SPAN televises live floor debates and counts down on-screen how long it takes for Democrats and Republicans to vote on it.
   
 Are you still with us, kids?
   
 If the bill makes it through, the entire process is repeated on the other side of Capitol Hill. In the meantime, the president continues to tweet about it, and spin doctors/talking heads continue to appear on the talk shows blessing it or blasting it.
   
 If the bill survives Capitol Hill, it's then off to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. for even more politicking. If the president likes it, the president signs it and all is well. If the president doesn't like it, the president will either veto it and tweet-dare Congress to override it, or try to incorporate it into some other legislative package.
   
 Get the picture now, kids?
   
 Perhaps Mr. Shelton, God rest his soul, could have updated the 1970s "Schoolhouse Rock" song to go something like, "I'm just a bill, yeah, I'm only a bill. But I'm raising Cain from Capitol Hill."
   
 Run that over and over through your mind as you try to sleep tonight.

It’s not clear whether sanitation issues had anything to do with this month’s presumed norovirus outbreak. The park certainly will have to do its share of super-cleaning now to get rid of the outbreak culprit. Dealing with a norovirus outbreak can be quite costly due to the extra clean-up and lost potential revenues. So if you are trying to cut corners and costs on cleaning, having such an outbreak could end up sending any savings quickly down the toilet.

CLEVELAND, GA – The Knights traveled to Georgia for their second road trip of the week and played the TMC Bears. For the second time this week, KCU left the campus with a pair of wins. First up, the women secured a 57-53 win and watched as the men needed overtime to complete the sweep by winning 86-83.
 In a relatively low scoring contest, Kentucky Christian needed every point they could muster as they shot a measly .338 from the field and managed only one made three-point shot. The eight additional shots (68-60) by the team proved the difference as the Bears made five more 3-pters for the game but lost the opportunity for the win by going 7-18 from the charity stripe.
