The FAI may have subsidised John Delaney’s lavish lifestyle and efforts to fend off press interest in his activities to the tune of three quarters of a million but it is the much smaller payments recorded as having been made to his former girlfriend, Susan Keegan, which are likely to be central to any potential prosecution of the association’s former chief executive.

“Jurrell is like a brother to me,” Henry said. “He’s a disruptive player, I think we all know what type of player he is. You’ve definitely got to prepare for him, and excited to go against him on Monday night.”
 Casey has been looking forward to playing his former team even though he knows corralling Henry could be one of the tougher tasks in the league.
 “The biggest thing is having all those guys to the ball. That’s one. When (Tannehill) hands the ball off to him, every guy’s on that pile, every guy’s tackling him. If we build a wall up front it makes the game a lot easier,” Casey said. “It’s when that dude gets the open lanes and starts hitting downhill and starts making those DBs and second-level guys miss is when you start getting in trouble.
 “Our biggest thing is making sure we up front are building that wall, getting off blocks and making sure he’s not getting just one or two guys, little guys, trying to make tackles. Us big guys have to make sure we’re there.”
 Denver’s defense took a huge hit last week when Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller sustained a major ankle tendon injury that required surgery and could sideline him for the entire season.

The strike came with surprising efficiency and unity. Workers stopped working in all four malls at once. Drivers, cashiers, technicians, accountants, department managers — all have their own specific demands. A very impressive picket was organized from early morning to dusk, even though the shop was not closed for those few who still wanted to work and for the adventurous customer. As usual, the shops’ entrance is overseen by a detachment of the government’s armed military police. On the picket, workers are organized along the same lines as they are in the shop, with department and store managers organizing the picket and talking to journalists. The strikers are also very aware of the traps put forward by their bosses: on one of the four pickets, our comrades were met with suspicion, and had to stand aside for an hour before a phone call from their own union gave the green light for the local picket organizer to talk to us.
