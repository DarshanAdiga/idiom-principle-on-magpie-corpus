With the goal of keeping students together with their classmates and teachers, Wilson County Schools will put those displaced by the destruction of West Wilson Middle and Stoner Creek Elementary schools at Mt. Juliet Middle and Springdale Elementary — with all four students bodies attending classes for four hours daily.
 One student body and their teachers will use a building in the morning, with the other using it in the afternoon. Before-school and after-school care will be provided, athletics will continue, and students will be fed despite the shorter days.
 WCS Director Donna Wright and Deputy Director Mickey Hall outlined the plan before a packed audience at Mt. Juliet High School on Monday morning, at times drawing applause.

“Enjoy!” she shouts out to each that pass through.
 While the meal is one most anyone would enjoy, it’s clear many in the crowd had been coming for many years. The organizers could point out some of the regulars that wouldn’t miss a night. Their fish fettish is a big help to the club that makes a small profit on each meal.
 VFW Club Manager Cody Boyer just smiles watching the well-oiled wheels of this fundraiser work each Friday night. He said the group functions well together and has to in order to make this event a success for so many years.
 “Good food, good help, good organization,” Janice Venske said. She’s another long-time volunteer of the event.
 Thoennes shared that the activities committee puts this event on to raise funds for various activities within the club.
 “We use it for different things we need, like maybe a new refrigerator,” Thoennes said. “We’ve got other building maintenance that needs to be done. Because everybody knows it is really hard to make a big profit when you’re running a bar.
 “Between our gambling program and activities and the club, we manage to have enough income to stay afloat, not getting rich, but we’re hanging in there,” Thoennes said.
 “It keeps the building going,” Venske said.
 “This is our biggest fundraiser,” Boyer said. He said their $12 a meal price is pretty inexpensive considering it’s a walleye meal. They are able to keep the price down because it’s run by volunteers.
 For those coming to the event all these years, the socialization is about as much a draw as the fish meal. As important as it is to eat, many here look forward to the event as a much needed escape from their homes. It turns out enjoying fish on Fridays isn’t much of a sacrifice for those that look forward to the meal every other week.

Another alternative: Go straight to the playoffs, brackets based on the standings as they are right now. Remember, though, that the public health crisis is steadily escalating. There remains a chance that the rest of the season could be canceled. (The Chinese Basketball Association suspended play in late January, with plans to resume in late April.)

La Liga has confirmed that all Spanish football has been suspended for the next two weeks in light of the spread of the coronavirus.
 The decision comes after the Spanish FA decided to suspend the next two weeks of non-professional football, with widespread pressure for La Liga to follow suit.
 The government recommendation had initially been to play the games behind closed doors but a host of organisations, including the AFE Spanish players union, wanted them postponed.
 It is claimed by the reports that La Liga did not want to take this step but did so under pressure from the other organisations, with Real Madrid’s game at home to Eibar on Friday night the first match to not be staged.
 The news comes as coronavirus continues to take hold in Spain – on Wednesday it was confirmed that there were 50 deaths in the country due to the virus, with all sport now on hold for at least 14 days.
