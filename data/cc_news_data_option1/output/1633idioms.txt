“We started getting people asking us, ‘Have you tested this?’ and ‘Have you tested that,’” said Robertson. “I’m working around the clock to try and answer more of these questions. We’re really happy to be able to help.”
 In addition to Smart Air, researchers from Virginia Tech, Missouri University of Science and Technology and Wake Forest Baptist Health have stepped in to test everyday mask materials. Some data has also come from a 2013 report from University of Cambridge researchers on homemade masks. The studies mostly compare mask filtration to the industry standard of 0.3 micron particles — the toughest particle size to catch. Some reports look at larger particles.
 The problem with all of the studies is that there is tremendous variability in fabrics used in T-shirts, jeans and pillow cases. Even disposable shopping bags and paper towels come in different materials and weights. While you may not have access to the exact fabric tested, the research can give you guidance.
 For comparison, the N95 mask, which should be saved for medical workers, filters 95% of 0.3 micron particles. A rectangular surgical mask filters between 60% to 80% of those particles. While simple fabric masks don’t test as well, studies show that homemade masks still can help stop the spread of viral illness and offer adequate protection for people practicing social distancing, even if a mask is capturing a lower percentage of small particles.
 When in doubt, hold fabrics up to a light to compare how much light filters through: The less light, the better. Test the fabric to make sure that you can breathe through it before turning it into a mask.
 From all the tests, a few things stand out. In general, a lot of everyday fabrics do a good job filtering larger viral particles and respiratory droplets (the type many of us would encounter by a person sneezing or coughing nearby). Everyday fabrics are less effective at filtering very small particles, but in the lab setting, some homemade mask materials can rival a standard medical mask for filtration efficiency.
 In most cases, natural fibers performed better than synthetic ones, and two layers are better than one. Some items, like vacuum bags and coffee filters, do a good job of filtering but can be tough to breathe through.

 Beatrice Ann (Loft) Barber passed away peacefully of natural causes on April 13th, 2020 in Blaine, WA. Bea was born on June 19th, 1931 to Harry & LaFern (Johnston) Loft, in Oakland, CA. The family moved to Bellingham when she was 6 months old. It is said she slept the entire length of the car trip, a trait she continued throughout her life. Bea graduated from Bellingham High School as Valedictorian at the age of 16 and went to work at the Sears Roebuck store on Cornwall Avenue in Bellingham for many years, where she made many lifelong friends. Bea married Joe Barber in 1958 and moved to Blaine to raise their family. She worked for the City of Blaine for many years and retired as the City Treasurer in 1991. Bea was pre-deceased by her husband Joe and sister Anita Frazier. She is survived by her children, Pat Barber, Matthew Barber, and Julia (Cory) Swinburnson, and grandchildren Bree McWilliam, Rachel McWilliam and Isabella Zane, as well as many nieces and nephews. The family would like to thank the staff at Stafholt Good Samaritan facility in Blaine for their compassionate and loving care of our mother for the past two years.

The winner, 43-year-old Yoichi Fukazawa of the Liberal Democratic Party and who was also backed by its junior coalition partner Komeito, faced off against 42-year-old Ken Tanaka, who was endorsed by four major opposition parties.
 As the entire nation is under a state of emergency, the candidates refrained from holding large-scale gatherings for supporters to reduce transmission risks.
 Voter turnout was expected to be low as people have been asked to stay at home unless there is an urgent reason not to do so. Abe has opposed the postponing of elections, saying they are at the heart of democracy and voting is deemed as important and urgent.
 The candidates turned to social media and YouTube to reach voters and explain their policy platforms during the 12 days of campaigning. Senior party executives also sought to reach out to voters in Shizuoka from Tokyo amid the nationwide state of emergency.
 Some campaign staff acknowledged that online campaigning had its limits given the number of elderly and other voters not necessarily used to social media.
 In the run-up to Sunday's poll, Abe yielded to pressure from Komeito and made an abrupt policy change in mid-April to provide ¥100,000 ($930) per person to support all those affected by his nationwide emergency declaration.
 The opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the Democratic Party for the People, the Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party supported Tanaka, a political newcomer.
 The election was held to fill a seat vacated by former Environment Minister Yoshio Mochizuki, who died in December at the age of 72.
 The two other candidates who took part in the election were independent Kenzo Yamaguchi, 72, and Ken Tanaka, 54, of NHK Kara Kokumin Wo Mamoru To (The Party to Protect the People from NHK), which was established by a former employee of NHK.
 As there were two candidates named Ken Tanaka, the local election board asked voters to write the age of the candidate they voted for on the ballot. The two men also use the same Chinese characters.

In terms of the potential market impact of the trades these ETFs need to do each day, we estimate that the managers of these public leveraged ETFs need to buy or sell about _$10 billion_ of equities when the stock market goes up or down by 5%, and most of that trading has to happen near the closing bell each day. Of course, many market participants are aware of these, and other similarly predictable flows coming from options-hedging and leveraged investment strategies such as Risk Parity and volatility targeting funds. In trying to profit from these anticipated flows, opportunists smooth them out and make them harder to pinpoint, but their impact doesn't completely disappear.7
 ## Sizing Your Stock Market Exposure for the Long-Term
 As you know from our other research notes, we think choosing your equity allocation should be a forward-looking exercise, driven by your assessment of future return and risk, and your own circumstances and personal level of risk aversion. That said, it's still interesting and instructive to take a look back sometimes, and we're going to take a look at how different levels of stock market exposure – including leveraged – would have performed over the long-term.
 From 1927 to the end of March 2020,8 the annualized total return on the S&P 500 was 9.6%, which would have turned a $1mm investment into $4.5 billion today – not too shabby. Average stock market volatility was just under 19%, and T-Bills returned 3.7% p.a. If you were around in 1927 and had a crystal ball, wouldn't you have been tempted to invest in equities on margin and really make a killing for your lucky descendants? After all, if investing 100% of your savings in equities for the long-term was sure to be great, why not invest 200% or 300% of your savings?
 The table below works through this thought experiment, showing how things would have turned out for an equity investor taking on different amounts of leverage over those nearly 100 years.9 Notice that 1.5x leverage leaves you with the most money at the end, but at some point you'd have experienced a drawdown of 95%. Above 1.5x leverage, return goes down and risk goes up, driven by the volatility drag we've been discussing. At 4x leverage, after suffering more than a 99.99% drawdown, you'd eventually only be left with the $1 you started with (just $0.09 inflation-adjusted), and at 5x leverage you'd have been fully wiped out on October 19th, 1987. Here's an interesting thought-experiment: what equity exposure would you have chosen standing in 1927 with the crystal ball?10

_Kingdomino_ is a dead-simple tile-laying game in which you try to group different areas—ocean, wheat field, mine, etc.—of your kingdom in order to score points. Some tiles have crowns on them. At the game's end, each set of contiguous area tiles is scored by multiplying the size of that area by the number of crowns on its tiles. Simple? Sure, except that you have to keep your kingdom within a 5x5 grid, and every area tile must be placed such that it touches an existing tile of that type. To make this even trickier, new tiles come out of the box and are chosen in player turn order—but the tile you take in one round determines your player order in the next. Take the better tile now and choose last in the next round? Or grab something not quite as good that will still get you first or second pick next time?

But as more inmates have walked free, the releases have faced a growing backlash in St. Louis and other parts of the country.
 “It’s a slap in the face,” said Fehrenbacher, whose 28-year-old daughter was run over after a baseball game. “Just the fact that he’s out there living, doing whatever he wants to do, and yet my daughter is never going to be able to do that again.”
 The debate over who should be let out has become fierce in some places. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order barring the release of some inmates, arguing that it “would not only gravely threaten public safety but would also hinder efforts to cope with the COVID-19 disaster.” The order was fought in Texas’ highest court, which ruled on procedural grounds in Abbott’s favor this week.
 Law enforcement officials in Massachusetts expressed concern that the state’s highest court had held a closed-door hearing on inmate releases. In Washington state, some law enforcement officials argued that a plan by the governor to grant early release to nearly 1,000 inmates could include people who had committed assault and sexual crimes. “I feel the release of these additional offenders is of great risk to public safety,” Sheriff Robert Snaza of Lewis County said in a statement.
 Many opponents have pointed to a case in Florida, where a Tampa man was accused of shooting and killing someone the day after he and more than 160 other inmates were freed from Hillsborough County jails last month.
 Releasing inmates carries risks, acknowledged Miriam Krinsky, executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a national network of progressive prosecutors. But leaving things the way they are would cause even more harm, she said. More inmates and employees would be infected in crowded facilities and, because of the high turnover rate in local jails, would then carry the disease into the community.
 “Doing nothing is going to ensure that there will be tens of thousands of additional deaths,” she said.

 CAMERON, Veronica Gillmeister Ronnie 94, of Middleport, NY, died peacefully April 21, 2020 in the tender care of the staff of Father Baker Manor in Orchard Park. Whether through a sewing project, flowers from her garden, or a birthday card, she always made sure to brighten the days of those around her family, friends, and neighbors alike. Born November 25, 1925 in Albion, New York, to Michael and Mary (Smith) Bokman, Veronica lived on Griswold Street in the Town of Middleport for over half a century. She graduated from Albion High School and spent a few years enjoying city life with her sister Mary in Tonawanda as they held their first office jobs. After marrying Louis E. Gillmeister, she brought up three children, helped lead a Girl Scout troop, and took part in the activities of the Home Bureau. She and Louis were well known in the area for raising peacocks and for growing beautiful trees and flowers. They were devoted parents and grandparents and wonderful neighbors. Veronica worked for many years as an executive assistant at the Kimmins Corporation, first in Niagara Falls and later in Tampa, Florida. A woman of great faith, she was a member of St. Stephen's R.C. Church in Middleport, now Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Parish, and St. Lawrence Catholic Church in Tampa. From 1985 to 2015, Veronica lived in Tampa for part of each year. There, after the death of her husband, Louis in 1993, she met Donald W. Cameron, whom she married in 1996. Veronica was predeceased by her husband, Louis E. Gillmeister; her second husband, Donald W. Cameron; his son, John Cameron; and grandson, Gabriel Huckabee; her sister, Mary Basinait; her brothers, Michael, Henry, Joseph and Jimmy Bokman; and her grandson, Steven Gillmeister. She is survived by brother, Clement Butch Bokman; and sister, Rita Lewis; sisters-in-law, Arlene Bokman and Donna Bokman; children, David (Barbara) Gillmeister, Ann Gillmeister and William (Caitlin) Gillmeister; step-children, Donald Cameron, Ellen Cameron, Margaret Petti and Laurie Cameron; grandchildren and step-grandchildren, Ethan Gillmeister, Alison and John Paul Gillmeister, Nicholas Huckabee, Jeanette, Margaret, Cynthia and Marion Cameron, and Tyler and Saorise Keel; great-granddaughter, Natalie Tavares; and many beloved nieces and nephews, whose birthdays she almost always remembered. A Memorial Mass will be scheduled and announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to www.gillyshouse.com or Holy Trinity Food Pantry in Middleport.

South Shore towns with local elections set for April and May have moved quickly to reschedule them due to the coronavirus pandemic, taking advantage of a move by Massachusetts lawmakers to grant municipalities the ability to postpone the democratic process in the interest of public health and safety.
 Since the legislation was passed in late March, every South Shore town with an election on the calendar has opted to postpone. A majority have settled on dates in June.
 The bill incorporates guidelines for voter registration deadlines, the display of sample ballots, public notification of rescheduled election dates and absentee ballot processing. It also grants municipal governments the ability to postpone caucus or certain elections set to take place before May 30 to a date prior to June 30.
 One of the major components of the legislation is the ability for voters to cast their ballot early by mail -- a move the state is allowing for all eligible residents for the first time.
 Rep. Kathy LaNatra, D-Kingston, said prior to the new legislation that she'd heard major concerns from town clerks and local governments about looming election dates, the majority of which revolved around public health being in jeopardy.
 "The majority of our voters, our local voters, are people that are older," she said. "They are mostly at risk, so there was robust discussion about this. I'm happy that this legislation enables us to protect the public health while still preserving our elections. We need to still continue that process."
 More than a week ago, Wisconsin went ahead with its primary election after the state's Supreme Court blocked Gov. Tony Evers' executive order suspending in- person voting. Images of voters wearing masks and standing within feet of each other in long lines circulated across the internet.
 "That's crazy to me," Sen. Patrick O'Connor, R-Weymouth, said.
 O'Connor said he cherishes democracy, but in the midst of a public health crisis, no large gatherings should take place, particularly when the lives of vulnerable populations are at stake.
 "I think that the local communities really need guidance from the state when it comes to how to approach elections given the current circumstances and challenges," he said. "Delaying every part of the election process is appropriate."
 The Marshfield Board of Selectmen voted on March 30 to postpone the town's election from May 2 to May 30 - only one day before Gov. Charlie Baker extended the stay-at-home advisory to May 4, said Town Clerk Narice Casper. The new date marks the earliest local election to take place on the South Shore.
 Casper said she has concerns about whether it will be safe to hold the election in May. She is the only person working in the office at the moment, Casper said, because she does not want to take the risk of any of her employees falling ill.
 "Even with the early voting that they're allowing, I still have to get a request from the voter, I have to mail out that ballot, I have to bring it back," Casper said. "I'd have to process it anyway. Unless I got all 20,000 of my voters to return their ballots, I'd have to have a live election."
 For weeks now, Casper said she has been racking her mind over what the best practices proceeding may be - from the effectiveness of scanning ballots with ultraviolet light to cleaning off every pen with a disinfecting wipe to providing polling staff with protective gear.
 "I have grave concerns about asking people to work during an election," Casper said. "I wanted this job. I love this job. I want to do the best that I can by my people, and right now I'm betwixt and between."
 Plymouth Town Clerk Laurence Pizer expressed similar apprehensions. The Board of Selectmen on Tuesday voted to postpone the municipal election from May 16 to June 20.
 "It really is a health and safety matter," he said, adding that the majority of the work his staff is required to do can only be accomplished at Town Hall, which is closed until May 4.
 An additional unease on Pizer's mind is the upcoming state special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Republican Sen. Vinny M. deMacedo in the Plymouth and Barnstable District. That election is scheduled to take place on May 19.
 "We haven't gotten to the point where we're interested in exposing our poll workers to the general public a week and a half after the state emergency is lifted," he said. "There's just no way we can be ready for that one either."
 LaNatra said there is a chance that town boards may be able to postpone elections past the end of June.
 "I don't know where this curve is going to go," she said. "That possibly may be extended again depending on how things go."

Burrow developed his quarterback skills a few hours away in southeastern Ohio, leading his prep team to the playoffs. A failed stint at Ohio State became a launching point to a national title and Heisman Trophy at LSU.
 For the draft Thursday, he wore a white shirt with the outline of Ohio and the 740 area code for southeast Ohio. He also held a black Bengals cap, waiting for the pick.
 When the Bengals called to make it official, he donned the cap and became the face of the franchise.
 "We will never pick at No. 1 again," coach Zac Taylor said. "We don't want to pick in the top 10 again. We're looking at this as the only time you're going to get this caliber player to add him to the program, so obviously this is a big deal."
 Burrow's roots in Ohio made him even more desirable for a team that's had some of the league's lowest attendance figures for years and will be renegotiating its lease for the stadium — named after founder Paul Brown — in a few years.
 There's a lot riding on this draft pick.
 "He's been in the area and he knows what we're all about," Taylor said. "There's probably people in the area who know what he's about and will probably be drawn to the Bengals."
 He moves to a team that went 2-14 last season in Taylor's first year, losing a club-record 11 games in a row. Cincinnati has lost 21 of its last 24 games.
 That's what the Heisman winner is up against now.

"I wonder how much of the day I spend just callin' after you." \-- Harper Lee, "To Kill a Mockingbird"
 The absolute worst Red Sox Opening Day ever, EVAH, for this longtime fan. April 9, 2019. A year ago. A lifetime ago.
 I'd gotten two tickets from someone (my brother maybe?) and was so looking forward to a gem of a day, the kind of day one can only dream of in early April in these parts of New England. I hoped and prayed for simple gifts. Warm temps. Sunny and blue skies. An early arrival at Fenway to see the 2018 World Series champs receive their rings. A Red Sox win. Time spent with an old friend in our right field bullpen seats, and of course, two hot dogs slathered with mustard and onions, with an ice-cold Coke on the side.
 About the only thing that came true for me that day was my companion and my lunch menu.
 All the rest went south and very fast. The weather was abysmal, 41 degrees at game time, with chilly winds making it feel like 35 degrees. I tried to leave work early to arrive at the park on time, but left late and missed the whole pregame celebration. Then the game, a total disaster from the very first pitch thrown by Chris Sale, he, who recently signed a $145 million contract and made his 2019 home debut with a thud. Four innings pitched, five runs allowed on seven hits and three walks, and he even allowed a runner to steal home.
 My God, how I wish I could go back to that day.
 Live it all over again, because in these pandemic weird and warped times, when it feels as if we are all living in a surreal dream, I am so missing baseball right now, even bad baseball. Missing going to the sports section first, in my online newspaper, and finding out if the Sox pulled out a win or found another way to lose. I miss putting the game on my car radio, that soundtrack of spring and summer returning again, like an old friend. I miss going to Minnesota for a yearly writing trip and retreat and spending time down in the Twin Cities playing catch with my 12-year-old Goddaughter BJ, out on the front lawn, the thwack of the ball on leather, or maybe a game of rundown. She always wants to play catch. ALWAYS. I miss her so much right now too, wonder when I'll be able to actually fly in a plane again.
 This is our shared universal spiritual condition now, in 2020, in April. All of us: we are so missing something, so missing someone.
 Missing the dependable rituals and rites of the season. Missing being out in public with friends and strangers. Missing sitting at the bar in a jam-packed restaurant, waiting for your seat, as the game plays on a big TV screen. Missing standing in a huge crowd on Boylston Street and cheering on the marathoners. Missing standing up in church and singing a big Easter hymn or sharing Passover with extended family and friends at a candlelit table, the youngest always asking, "Why is tonight different from all others?"
 If you dig a bit deeper into our feelings of missing, of our longing for the "normal" things of life, you'll discover grief. We are grieving now, a month into the lockdown and social distancing, and wearing rubber gloves and a mask to the grocery store, and spending hours staring at a screen at our loved ones and co-workers and obsessively consuming the news or avoiding the news.
 My missing baseball? I know it's just a little grief, a little "death."
 The big griefs, the big losses? These hurt so much more. Grief at actually losing someone to COVID-19 -- a family member, a co-worker, a neighbor's beloved grandparent. Grief at losing a job. Grief at not being able to formally graduate from college or high school. Grief at watching a spouse walk out the door to their work, their "essential" work, and praying that they do not catch the virus. Grief at not being able to worship with others or play with others or hug others or physically be with others.
 Maybe I'm focused on how aggrieved I am about baseball being on hold because it is just too hard for me to contemplate all of our so much more heartbreaking griefs. The ones already here. The ones yet to come.
 What are you missing? Who are you missing?
 My spiritual hope for all of us right now is simple. That we would have the courage to pay attention to our grief, both the collective and the personal. That we would begin to grieve and not turn away from it or pretend it is not real. That we would talk about it with folks we trust. Weep when we must or just rage at the universe. That we would bring our grief to God or whatever power is getting us through right now, and most important? May we remember that it is so normal to be missing all that which once marked our world, even something as simple as baseball. I trust and I know it will all come back again one day soon, but right now?
 We grieve.
 We hope.
 Together.

New Delhi, Apr 26 (PTI) Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the coronavirus situation in the country is improving as many hotspot districts (HSD) are moving towards being non-hotspot districts (NHSD).
 The minister visited All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Trauma Centre to take stock of the preparedness to overcome COVID-19, a statement from the ministry said.
 During his visit, he spoke to some COVID-19 positive people through video calling and enquired about their health. Robots handled the technology at the patients' end, it said.
 Vardhan also sought their feedback about the facilities available at AIIMS so that necessary improvements can be made, the statement said.
 "Through a graded, pre-emptive and pro-active approach, the Government of India is taking several steps along with the states/UTs for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19. These are being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level," the ministry said.
 After a detailed review, Vardhan appreciated AIIMS for ensuring 24X7 monitoring of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients using digital platforms, video and voice call technologies.
 He also urged the people to observe lockdown in letter and spirit and to treat it as an effective intervention to cut down the spread of COVID-19.
 "The situation is improving in India as Hot Spot Districts (HSD) are moving towards being Non Hot Spot Districts (NHSD)," the minister said.
 Meanwhile, the cabinet secretary had a detailed video conferencing with chief secretaries and DGPs of states and Union Territories (UTs) to review the preparedness for COVID-19 response.
 Vardhan asserted that states with high viral load should focus on effective implementation of lockdown measures and containment strategy.
 "They also need to focus on medical infrastructure like adequate availability of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators," he said.
 As of now, 5,804 people have been cured of coronavirus with a recovery rate of 21.90 per cent in the country, the ministry said.
 A total of 26,496 people have been confirmed positive for COVID-19, it said, adding 824 deaths have been reported in India.

Even before the coronavirus crisis, women spent about four hours a day on unpaid work, like laundry, grocery shopping and cleaning, compared with about 2.5 hours for men, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That labor has expanded exponentially in recent weeks, as Americans home-school their children and help older family members and friends more vulnerable to the virus.
 In interviews with more than a dozen women who work as lawyers, writers, architects, teachers, nurses and nonprofit administrators, many said that they were grateful to have some child care help pre-quarantine, and that they could work from home. But they have been slightly stunned to learn that they are expected to organize and manage every domestic need for their family, while maintaining a full-time professional career as part of a dual career couple.
 It was feminism of earlier generations, after all, that declared “the personal is political.” So the fact that the crisis hit after stinging political defeats for female presidential candidates adds to the uncomfortable reckoning for many Democratic women — even if they had decided themselves that the most viable way to defeat President Donald Trump was to support a male candidate.
 When Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race, Gretchen Newsom sat in her car and burst into tears. Six weeks later, Warren backed her onetime political rival Joe Biden, and Newsom is working, parenting and teaching as a single mother. And, as the political director for the San Diego chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, she is struggling around the clock to answer fearful questions from union members.
 “It is kind of a slap in the face; we’re doing all of this and yet we have so little representation,” she said.
 While the political disappointment may be most acute among liberal women, the bargain is bipartisan. Indeed, it is the kind of “lean in” feminism embraced by people like Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter — whose 2017 book “Women Who Work” essentially told women to get enough help to do it all — that is facing perhaps one of the most jarring shifts. It’s also an economic struggle, long clear in the lives of women who earn lower wages, that feminist political leaders have criticized for years.

“When I see what Josh is doing, it seems very unique but fills a very specific need in the creator community,” said Earnest Pettie, a trends insights lead at YouTube. “It’s no secret that some of the best performing executives have executive coaches. Creators are an emerging class of media professionals, and so it’s great to see them engage with experts who can provide support and resources to help them remain productive in a positive way.”
 Zimmerman’s role feels especially vital now, in the midst of a health crisis that has sent half the world home for an indefinite period and glued many of them to their phones. The pandemic has been a boon for influencers who can provide actionable advice to followers in the coronavirus era — fitness coaches, food bloggers and medical professionals, for example — but those in other sectors, such as travel and fashion, have collectively lost millions in brand deals and ad revenue.
 Most creators have continued working, business as usual or even more than usual. “In a time when everything is shutting down and businesses are closing, the general populace is turning more to entertainment and media,” Stoner said.
 And the competition is fierce. “You’re putting out more content, but your audience has been diluted because there’s all these other people going live at the same time or putting new stuff out,” Zimmerman said. “You’re trying even harder to get those eyeballs and the money is not coming in as it should be, and maybe the brand deals you’ve relied on have disappeared.”
 There are also platform changes to navigate. YouTube initially demonetized any video mentioning COVID-19, prompting YouTube stars to steer clear of the coronavirus as a topic.
 “It scared a lot of my clients from putting anything out there because they didn’t want to get demonetized, even for spreading the word about helping people stay inside and stay safe,” Zimmerman said. “There’s been an onslaught of creators who are uncertain and really reaching out for structure in their lives.”

“This tragedy is something we have never seen before. Huge rocks came from the hills with people totally battering their bodies into pieces. What we got downstream was just body parts. It will not be possible to get any more bodies, maybe just parts. Let us just accept this fact,” Mr Natembeya told the _Nation_.
 He also said the government will conduct food distribution to the displaced.
 On Sunday, families embarked on the torturous search for their missing loved ones as North Rift leaders piled pressure on the government to resume the exercise three days after leaving the site.
 Elgeyo-Marakwet Senator Kipchumba Murkomen said it was wrong for the government to leave the site before people found closure for those yet to be found.
 “Twenty-three bodies are still missing in Marakwet landslide tragedy. These people are searching for their loved ones. Regional Coordinator George Natembeya and the military went there, took pictures and left. Meanwhile thousands of them are without shelter. What the is going on in this country?” posed Mr Murkomen.
 Uasin Gishu Senator Margaret Kamar also said the government’s search team left too soon saying it should have spent more time there.
 “I will recommend for the government to continue its presence in the place. Families will not just leave there. They will still be there hoping to find their loved ones,” said Ms Kamar.
 On Sunday, dozens of residents removed from huge rocks to the mounds of muddy soils hoping to stumble upon the bodies of those still unaccounted for.
 Since Friday, they had only found dismembered parts dimming hopes of finding intact bodies.
 The search, according to the team constituted by the area leadership, had been constrained by thick sludge and huge rocks.
 The team’s leader Noah Kiptoo from Liter said the Marakwet tradition gives great respect to members of the society who have died.
 "Even though the operation was called off by the government, we cannot just let our people get lost like that. We will try as much as possible to account for the 23 people who are still missing from the tragedy," he said on Sunday.
 According to a list of names of the missing people shared with the _Nation_ by the area MP Kangogo Bowen, the total number of people unaccounted for spreads across the villages around Chesegon shopping centre and the Embobut escarpment where the floods started from.
 Even as the frantic search continues, hundreds of families displaced by the floods in Kipchumwa, Kobil and Katiliit locations are still camping in Wewo AIC church, spending the night in cold with kids and scarcity of basic amenities to keep them there.
 Ms Nasaline Jerop, 28 who is camping at the church said her 12-year-old daughter Mercy Jemutai, 12, a pupil at Tendwo Primary School, was still missing.
 "I still don't know where my daughter is until today. I will be very happy and will have a rest when she will be found even if dead. Laying her to rest will be the most perfect solution to what I'm feeling right now," said Ms Jerop.
 Samuel Kirotich, 47, said his daughter Jerop Kilimo, 8, a Standard Three pupil at Katiliit Primary School had gone to visit her grandmother in Kakisoo village when the disaster happened.
 "As everyone was trying to save their lives, my daughter, probably due to her young age and lack of energy to rush to safer grounds was caught up in floods and swept away," he said.

Earlier this week, a prison in Marion, Ohio, became the largest-known source of coronavirus cases in the country, with more than 1,800 inmates — about three-quarters of its population — testing positive. Two inmates and one staff member have died.
 In St. Louis, the debate came to a head after the local prosecutor, known as the circuit attorney, and the public defender announced in late March that they had agreed to seek the release of dozens of defendants awaiting trial, including some accused of felonies such as burglary and firearms possession.
 The state’s attorney general, Eric Schmitt, a Republican, wrote to the prosecutor, Kimberly Gardner, a Democrat, blasting her decision. “Given the public’s anxiety, this is no time to quietly negotiate the release of dangerous criminals,” Schmitt said.
 Gardner accused the attorney general of fearmongering and said her office had objected to letting out many defendants with violent records.
 Since she was elected four years ago, Gardner, the first black person to hold the post of circuit attorney, has been locked in a heated battle with the local police union and city officials over her efforts to crack down on police misconduct and to make changes in the criminal justice system.
 Her charge to protect public safety includes ensuring the health and safety of those behind bars, Gardner said in an interview. “They are not throwaways. They also have families.

ELDRIDGE, Herbert A. Of Sarasota, passed away on April 4th, 2020. He was 97 years old. Herb was born in Dayton, Ohio. He was one of seven siblings born to Hubert and Rosa (Smith) Eldridge. Herb served in the United States Army during WWII as a medic. While serving in North Africa under the command of General George S. Patton, he met and fell in love with Lt. Grace Genevieve West, a registered nurse. Herb and Grace later married in England. After returning back to the states they settled in Grace's hometown of Butler, Pennsylvania where they had their four children. Herb relocated his family to Dayton, Ohio where he opened Eldridge Body Shop, Inc. specializing in automobile collision repair and refinishing. After many years and much success, Herb retired. He and Grace relocated to sunny Florida. Herb was always a hard working business man and preferred to keep himself busy, so he opened another Eldridge Body Shop, Inc. in Sarasota in 1978, which is still family owned and operated to this day.

The sea wall project isn’t on hold yet, Strong said. But as tax revenue shrinks, there will be more demands on the money that remains, such as finding ways to help protect the city’s homeless population from the virus.
 Strong said San Francisco’s challenge was to figure out how much it has to spend now on climate adaptation projects, without sacrificing the city’s fight against the virus. And both needs keep growing, along with the budget shortfall.
 If San Francisco can’t protect its residents and its economy from the coronavirus now, Strong added, then it will be harder to raise money later for the infrastructure projects it needs to defend against climate change.
 Another city where the coronavirus has collided with the demands of climate change is Miami Beach. In 2015, the city began the process of elevating roads that frequently flood because of rising seas, and installing new pumps to control the water.
 Miami Beach has done about 20% of the neighborhoods on its list, according to Roy Coley, the city’s public works director, and had planned to issue bonds to pay for the next set of projects.
 Then the coronavirus hit, shutting down the tourism industry that makes up much of Miami Beach’s economy. The virus is costing the city $3.6 million in lost tax revenue each week. That loss equals more than one-quarter of the city’s total revenue.

Paul Woodmansee, president of BYK Construction of Sedro-Woolley, said crews are ready to get back to their jobs. He expects work will resume over the next few days on the Hub City Apartments, a 72-unit building in Burlington, and on homes in the River’s Edge and Woodrow Place communities.
 “I never thought I would be writing a COVID-19 pandemic response policy,” he said. “Making sure teams are safe on site in going back to work is the number one priority.”
 Woodmansee said cloth masks and face shields will be provided to workers. A designated employee will serve as a COVID-19 site supervisor to ensure all workers follow the safety plan.
 He said the company’s plan includes a policy requiring crews to commit to complying with the stay-at-home order.
 “Somebody who has been hanging out with friends and has been going to parties and barbecues — we want on paper they haven’t been doing those things,” he said.
 Woodmansee said allowing single-family and multifamily construction to resume safely is needed because housing is in short supply.
 The plan to restart construction, which was developed with industry leaders and health officials, could serve as a model for allowing other businesses to gradually re-open, Gov. Jay Inslee said at a news conference Friday.
 Inslee said there is no timeline yet for re-opening the economy, and that “it would be way too dangerous, and all our data shows if we (reopened) today the virus would return with a vengeance.”
 The restart of construction work is expected to boost the economy.
 Anacortes Mayor Laurie Gere said during a televised address last week that resuming construction will pay wages, support supply purchases that help other local businesses and generate sales tax revenue for local governments.
 Jim Spane, owner of Spane Buildings in Mount Vernon, which specializes in barns, garages, and other buildings, said some projects may not restart right away due to the economic downturn.
 “For instance, we had a huge commercial building ready to go, and now we are on hold,” he said.
 The new safety requirements won’t be difficult to implement, and with small crews on most projects, social distancing will be easy, he said.
 Bruce Berglin, principal and CEO at TRICO Companies west of Burlington, which does commercial construction, said the company plans to restart projects on May 4. He said how quickly work restarts will depend on acquiring safety supplies, such as PPE, which has been in short supply.
 “(Employees) are overwhelmingly anxious to be where they should be — on the job,” Berglin said.

Yet the path forward is tricky. The coronavirus relief act passed by Congress last month waives or limits liability for volunteer health care providers, as well as those providing "pandemic countermeasures.” But how do businesses and other institutions fit into this picture?
 If employers are waived of liability altogether, they might not take enough precautions, such as introducing more social distancing in the workplace or providing more soap in the restrooms. Yet putting all the liability on employers doesn’t make sense either.
 If an infected but asymptomatic worker shows up at work and sickens coworkers, for example, should the employer be liable? The answer is far from obvious. Liability exists not to shift unmanageable risk, but rather to induce management to take possible and prudent measures of precaution.
 Another problem with liability law in this context is that the potential damages are high relative to the capitalization of most businesses. COVID-19 cases often pop up in chains; there have been many cases from a single conference, or in a single church choir, or on a single cruise ship. If a business or school is host to such a chain, it could be wiped out financially by lawsuits. In these cases the liability penalties do not have their intended deterrent effect because the money to lose simply isn’t there.
 This problem is especially severe for nursing homes, a major center of COVID-19 deaths. Under a regime of strict liability, if the lawsuits were allowed to proceed, many nursing homes would likely become insolvent. That could leave the 1.3 million Americans who stay in nursing homes without a place to live.
 Another problem with liability in this setting has to do with jury expertise. Are random members of the public really the best people to determine acceptable levels of COVID-19 risk and appropriate employer precautions? Juries are better suited for more conventional applications of liability law, such as when the handyman fixing your roof falls off your rickety ladder. Given the unprecedented nature of the current situation, many COVID-19 risk questions require experts.
 Finally, there is the issue of testing. Businesses could be of immeasurable help by testing their employees for COVID-19, as additional testing can help limit the spread of the virus (if only by indicating which workers should stay home or get treatment). Yet the available tests are highly imperfect, especially with false negatives. If businesses are liable for incorrect test results, and their possible practical implications, then business will likely not perform any tests at all, to the detriment of virtually everybody.
 So what is the best way forward? More than likely, it involves some mix of regulation and limitations on future liability. If neither businesses nor workers nor customers can do enough to make any given activity sufficiently safe, current restrictions on it should continue. Given the confined space and the number of yelling fans, for example, it may be a while before anyone attends an NBA game.
 For sectors that are allowed to reopen, liability should be capped at some modest level and limited to cases of extreme recklessness, gross negligence or criminal misconduct. Lawsuits thus could be very costly to businesses, in both monetary and reputational terms. That might be incentive enough for firms to impose additional safety precautions. Nonetheless, under such a system, most of the allowed reopenings could proceed — and help the U.S. economy rebound.
 For low-risk activities, it might be better to proceed with no COVID-19 liability at all. Younger people seem to be at less risk, so maybe it makes sense to reopen college dorms, for instance, even though some cases will occur. It is not clear the dorm owner can eliminate risk, beyond simply postponing the reopening of the dorm.
 New Zealand for some time has had an accident compensation system under which personal injury victims receive small payments from the government, but business usually gets off the hook. A version of this system could work for COVID-19 in the United States, but with modest liability obligations on business in some cases.
 Regardless of what exactly is the best approach, the liability question for COVID-19 is a major issue. As President Donald Trump has indicated, it will need to be addressed before any economic reopening gets very far.

Construction on most projects that are underway could be vulnerable to disruptions caused by outbreaks but otherwise appear to be continuing at status quo. Leach biked through a Trans Mountain construction zone in Edmonton on Thursday and it seemed unchanged, he said.
 "It feels like it's going full speed ahead," he said.
 A pipeline like Trans Mountain, which is regulated by the Canadian Energy Regulator, is not a commercial venture in the sense that it doesn't take full merchant risk and has bounds on the tolls it can charge. It's also largely able to pass any extra costs on to producers, Leach said.
 "They can't charge whatever the market will bear at any point of time and as a consequence of that they also have some protection for their capital investments," Leach said.
 The wildcard project is Keystone XL for several reasons, including that it doesn't have all its permits and is not materially under construction, he said.
 "It's relatively early in the process and the cross-border nature of it, the length of it, all these sorts of things make it more challenging in the current market. So that's probably one of the projects that is most likely to be affected," Leach said.
 TC Energy, which owns the project, did not respond to a request for comment.
 While some have mused that the oil price plunge signalled the beginning of the end for oil, Leach and Antweiler don't buy it.
 It would take broad public policy shifts or an energy technology revolution to stimulate a mass shift away from oil dependency. If anything, Leach said physical distancing habits could discourage drivers from making the switch to public transit, for example.
 "I'd love to see the oil industry fade away more quickly than it will, but as an energy economist I still know we depend on oil for transportation," Antweiler said.
 He said he expects demand for oil to remain stable for the next few years and it will be up to countries around the world to curb demand through policy until cleaner options become more cost effective.
 "There will be potentially a reduction in demand for oil but it won't be as fast as some hope," he said.
