Drink plenty of water. This is always one of those things everyone knows they need to do, but we all forget at some point. It is recommended to drink eight, eight-ounce glasses of water daily. Dehydration can not only cause a dry mouth or dry skin, it can also cause headaches, dizziness, inability to concentrate and fatigue. Bring a big jug of water with you to work or set some reminders on your phone to hit up the water bubbler throughout the day; if you’re at home, reminders can also help.
 Get up and move. Keeping your body moving not only helps get your blood pumping, it can keep you alert and help with stiff muscles. The American Diabetes Association recommends getting up and moving at least every 30 minutes. If you have a smart watch, you can even set a timer to remind you. Some great ways to stay active are getting up and walking around the building or neighborhood, bike or walk to work if it is close by, walk to take a lunch break at a restaurant or eat outside. Even if you find you’re unable to get up and away from your desk, you can stand for a bit, stretch regularly, do arm or ankle circles — any body movement is a great way to start.
 Stay organized. Keeping an organized desk and home not only helps with finding things you need, it can also help you feel better. Less clutter in your life can mean less clutter in your head, less stress and may give you the ability to be more productive with other things.

 MANCHESTER, England, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The Premier League's rules covering proposed takeovers of clubs are to be reviewed amid the lingering fall-out from the failed Saudi Arabian bid to take-over Newcastle United.
 The review of the 'Owners and Directors Test', previously known as the 'Fit and Proper Persons' test, was already underway before the Newcastle case, which had prompted criticism from the club and their fans.
 The Premier League, along with the Football League (EFL), had committed to a review of the rules and procedure following the demise of League One club Bury after its ownership problems.
 "Generally speaking, (with) the owners´ and directors´ test, we are in the process of having a look at it anyway and all of our rules require a fresh look every now and then," said Premier League CEO Richard Masters.
 "We were doing so in concert with the FA and EFL post Bury in any event. So I think that will continue," he told reporters.
 Newcastle said on Wednesday that the Premier League had rejected the bid made by PCP Capital Partners, the Reuben Brothers and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF).
 The Premier League had never stated that they had rejected the bid and the consortium itself stated in July that it had "withdrawn" the proposal, citing the lengthy process.
 "The club and its owners do not accept that Premier League chief executive Richard Masters and the Premier League have acted appropriately in relation to this matter and will be considering all relevant options available to them," said the club statement.
 The Premier League declined to comment on the Newcastle statement.
 Masters had said that he understood why fans were frustrated with the lack of information through the process but said that it was a tricky balancing act for the league.
 "It's right that in situations of commercial transactions there is an expectation of confidentiality and we certainly support that. That has to be balanced off against I think of the ability to keep fans updated if things do become complicated and do take longer than normal," he said.
 "Of course we will take stock on what happened. We have been as transparent as we can and that´s meant be talking - albeit briefly - to members of the Newcastle United Supporters' Trust and answering some of their questions as best as I could.
 "I am also writing an open letter to local Newcastle MPs (Members of Parliament) explaining what I could about the process and the issues we faced." (Reporting by Simon Evans Editing by Christian Radnedge)

The study also revealed that searches for divorce-related terms online dramatically reduced during lockdown.
 According to Beecham Peacock it may be that with a lockdown in place many people felt uncomfortable filing for divorce while things were so uncertain, and they were potentially still living with their ex. This would explain the reduction in searched for divorce-related terms.
 Divorce rates declined during the last recession. From 2006 to 2007 the number of divorces decreased by 3.0339% and from 2007-2008 there was a 5.01284% decrease in the number of divorces.
 A spokesman for Beecham Peacock said: "The steady decline we’re seeing in search volume for divorce-related queries in 2020 mirrors that somewhat.
 "It’s also worth considering that the current situation itself presents a “make or break” style situation so it may also have caused couples to evaluate their issues and work through them without the need for divorce.
 "Then once lockdown eased, we can see some terms like ‘divorce application’ start to return to its usual position in search volume. This could be an indication of things to come as we return to some sense of normality."

Despite the recent volume uptick, Priya Ranjan of Antique Stock Broking believes that the optimism behind MSIL's catch-up rally on the back of YoY growth in wholesale volumes is likely to fizzle out. He highlights two reasons for the same. The first is the rising utility share in industry volumes with MSIL being a weak player and increasing competition from Tata Motors and Renault in its core hatchback car portfolio. Despite a 70 per cent share in the growing entry level segment (customers are downtrading to lower priced cars), the company's retail market share has been at the 50 per cent mark over the last two months.

Bad idea today. The cars were wiped down dry and it was time to pull them into the garage to finish them off. The garage is air conditioned so I figured once I moved them into the garage all would be well again. Now, Lukas and Shannon were both out of sight.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Try as he might to change the subject, President Donald Trump can't escape the coronavirus.
 In April, the president tried to shift the public's focus to the economy. In July, to defending the country's "heritage." In September, to enforcing "law and order." But all along the way, the death toll from the coronavirus continued to mount.
 And now, Trump's own words are redirecting attention to his handling of the pandemic when he can least afford it — less than two months before Election Day.
 "I wanted to always play it down," Trump said of the threat from the virus. That was in a private conversation with journalist Bob Woodward last March that became public on Wednesday with the publication of excerpts from Woodward's upcoming book "Rage."

A personal focus for me in striving for more gender equality is to create an environment where we no longer celebrate perfection over bravery in girls and women. As Reshma Saujani, the founder of Girls Who Code, said in her 2016 TED Talk: "Most girls are taught to avoid failure and risk. To smile pretty, play it safe, get all A’s… Men are habituated to take risk after risk. They’re rewarded for it… In other words, we’re raising our girls to be perfect and we’re raising our boys to be brave." The world would be better off if women were able to live out their wildest dreams without feeling shackled to an impossible standard of perfection.

Harry Armstrong doesn’t know where he’d be right now, nearly 23 years later, had it not been for his senior season of high school football. Definitely not leading one of the best Riverside teams ever to the PIAA Class A championship game. For sure, not learning to overcome from that loss. And, he guesses, not talking about helping put together a football schedule on the fly on a Wednesday morning.
 The value of that one season is something he has never forgotten, and it’s worth remembering over the next few weeks, too.
 We’ve read a lot in these pages about those who aren’t going to play football this fall, and those who are going to wait before they even attempt it. For a lot of reasons, Riverside has taken a slightly different and somehow more radical approach: They’re trying their damnedest to play. Right now.
 Friday night, Armstrong’s young Vikings will storm out of the locker room at Jake Sobeski Stadium, their sights set on defending PIAA Class AAA champion Wyoming Area. A week later, they’ll host Academy of the New Church. A week after that, they’ll head to Tamaqua. Each of those games are the only ones in which a team from the Lackawanna Football Conference will be competing before October.
 Riverside has star quarterback Johnny Gilchrist and a bunch of players far short of his experience level, so this is not necessarily about pursuing championships. Which is good, considering that last season, those three impromptu opponents were 34-6, combined. But this isn’t about a team with aspirations of an impressive win-loss record doing whatever it can to hold on to those in the middle of a pandemic.
 It’s about a team placing a premium on the experience stability, structure and hope can provide for kids who’ve already had to sacrifice so much.
 “Having something like this to look forward to is extremely valuable,” Armstrong said. “It’s really hard to comprehend what it might mean to a student-athlete.
 “Knowing that we have games scheduled is very important, but they also have to know we have to take value in every single day. Because we don’t have any certainties right now.”
 There have been few throughout this process, in fact.
 For starters, their decision to pursue opportunities to play hasn’t been popular amongst their LFC peers. Honestly, there are no decisions in the age of COVID-19 that are going to be entirely popular or easy, especially when it comes to sports. But when pretty much everyone else made a pact to wait a month and see where the situation sat come October, it’s fair to argue Riverside made the difficult decision when it came to football and pressed on with hopes for September.
 Once it became somewhat widely known the Vikings were open for business, they cast a lot of lines into the pond and got a good amount of bites on the bait. There were some thoughts about taking games in the Lehigh Valley. A school from York County was interested in scheduling the Vikings, as were a few along the southern tier of New York state.
 Imagine throwing out a schedule of events you had planned for months, then redoing the whole thing in a matter of a few weeks. That’s the chore Armstrong and the district’s administration had to accomplish, all while making sure they could make it happen from a health and safety perspective.
 It was hectic and nerve-wracking. It was, to them, exciting as well. Not just because it means an opportunity to provide athletes with an opportunity, and not another disappointment.
 “I was actually in contact with a high number of students and parents just going to graduation parties (over the summer),” Riverside superintendent Paul Brennan said. “A multitude of (parents) came to me for private meetings to explain the effects some of their kids were having. Some of their kids have been in counseling that have never been in counseling before. I know on some of our sports teams, we have documented cases of anxiety and depression.
 “Just noticing the smiles, smiles were from ear to ear, and the mood was something you couldn’t put a price tag on this past week during our scrimmage (against Tunkhannock). We basically have to take risk in context, and that’s what we did for our kids.”
 There are some benefits of playing, and Armstrong concedes that much. For senior players who want to compete at the college level — Gilchrist, for one, is a potential Ivy or Patriot League prospect getting heavily recruited by some of the best academic programs at the Div. II level, Armstrong said — it’s an opportunity to show college coaches improvement against top competition. For underclassmen, it’s a chance to get adjusted to the speed of a different style of play than their used to seeing.
 The Vikings also got 44 volunteer workouts in before camp started two weeks ago. That’s nothing to dismiss in a year when most programs were fighting for any kind of workouts or practice they could get. Neither is the fact that Riverside’s roster will open the season with 44 players on it; that’s the most they’ve had in a while.
 But what’s most impressive about this effort to push forward is the realism that comes with it. These games provide more an opportunity for these kids to learn and compete and get away from a stark world for a while than they do a chance to win a lot. They also know this schedule is a day-to-day proposition. The virus works swiftly and harshly; it takes no prisoners and has no regard for anyone’s plans or football schedules, which is why Armstrong said he coached his team’s scrimmage against Tunkhannock more like a regular season game and will treat every regular season game like a playoff opportunity.
 Everything is tentative. But, everything is also relative.
 “There’s a lot of learning going on, but there are also a lot of opportunities to grow and become better,” Armstrong said. “I think this is going to be one of the most memorable years ever for Riverside.”
 Whatever players get out of that year, they owe to those who worked so hard to give it to them.

_Roma, 10 set 13:34 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Restyling per il reparto di ematologia dell'ospedale di Bint Jbeil, nell'ambito della missione in Libano, grazie a un progetto di sviluppo del settore sanitario portato a termine dal contingente italiano di Unifil, la Forza di interposizione delle Nazioni Unite schierata al confine con lo stato di Israele. I lavori, progettati e diretti dal contingente e realizzati con fondi del ministero della Difesa italiano, hanno riguardato la manutenzione straordinaria del primo piano dell'ospedale governativo, un'area di circa 680 metri quadrati che può contare su 16 stanze doppie, per un totale di 32 posti letto, destinati alla cura di pazienti affetti da malattie del sangue, anche molto gravi, quali leucemie, linfomi e mielomi. "I lavori di ristrutturazione hanno dato vita a un reparto moderno e all'avanguardia che permetterà di aumentare la qualità e il comfort dell'assistenza clinica ai pazienti", ha affermato il direttore dell'ospedale, Taufil Farj, a margine della cerimonia di inaugurazione, alla quale hanno partecipato il sindaco di Aytarun, Salim Mrad, il sindaco di Yarun, Ali Tehfeh, e il comandante del settore Ovest di Unifil, generale di brigata Andrea Di Stasio. "Grazie all'intervento del contingente italiano, al quale va il nostro ringraziamento per la vicinanza e la consueta attenzione al soddisfacimento delle esigenze di carattere sanitario del distretto, sarà possibile riprendere a pieno ritmo le attività connesse con la diagnosi e la cura di patologie ematiche che possono colpire anche le fasce più' giovani della popolazione". Come ha spiegato il direttore dell'ospedale, il reparto si conferma sempre di più "un'eccellenza nel campo dell'assistenza e del consolidamento dell'emergenza-urgenza dell'intero governatorato di Nabatiye". "Il diritto di ogni cittadino alla salute", ha sottolineato il generale Di Stasio, "è fondamentale per il benessere e la prosperità del Paese. Sono questi i cardini per l'elevazione della dignità dell'individuo in ogni società e quindi di primario interesse anche per l'intero popolo libanese. Per questa ragione ho condiviso immediatamente la proposta e la necessità di intervenire tempestivamente, compatibilmente con i tempi di progettazione ed esecuzione dei lavori, nella realizzazione di questo progetto, perseguendo il ripristino e la piena funzionalità' della struttura sanitaria nel minor tempo possibile".

BGSU men’s and women’s basketball each released a tentative schedule last week, but the likelihood of having a season is still unknown.
 There is still optimism around both programs, and with BGSU hockey being a winter sport slated to start on Oct. 9, both programs are still treating it as if the season is a go.
 “The biggest thing is business as usual. We don’t know when it is going to happen, but I want to be prepared for if it happens. If we go into it saying . . . we aren’t going to have a season and we do, then we won’t be prepared. My biggest thing now is preparing us as if we are having a season,” BGSU Men’s Basketball Head Coach Michael Huger said.
 However, while being prepared is great, that task is even more difficult than normal with the struggles of the pandemic. Women’s Basketball Head Coach Robyn Fralick and her team know it is important to keep improving despite the challenges of the pandemic.
 “We really feel like we can continue to build. That can look different, but we always have a chance to build. What’s in front of us everyday, that could be our fitness, our skill level, our togetherness, our leadership. Even during these really challenging times we still feel like we have been able to have the ability to get better,” she said.
 But a big fear for many student-athletes around the world is this work could be for nothing, which is why many believe work has to be done to make a season possible, so the sacrifices made can be worth it.
 “So for the sacrifice that my guys have to make of doing things the right way and not going out to parties and not going out to bars and things like that, I think that’s a big sacrifice and I think they should be rewarded with the opportunity to play,” Huger said.
 Fralick knows the term “sacrifice” doesn’t just apply to recent times either. In many cases, college athletes have worked hard for the opportunity to play in the normal year.
 “I just want it for my kids. It is just such a great piece of your experience. You know getting to play college athletics is something that you have worked very hard for over the journey of your life and to get here and to have that opportunity I really want it from them. I just think it’s such an important piece of their experience here,” she said.
 But this type of discipline and sacrifice during a pandemic is something almost no one has had to deal with.
 Being cautious has been taken to a new level for many around the world, and that includes athletes that want to have a season. But temptations can still be present, and now with more students on campus those temptations could grow.
 “All the students are back. When we had them in the summer it was just the teams, just the sports teams. Us, football, volleyball were back. It’s just such a smaller group that you can control that. Now with the students back it is so easy and tempting to go out and hang out and party with them and gather in large groups and now somebody could get sick and they bring that back to the team,” Huger said.
 As we know though, everything doesn’t rest solely in their hands.
 And the prospect that the same conference making this decision, the MAC, made the decision to postpone the fall football season doesn’t sit well with many hoping for a season.
 But Huger notes basketball is much different than football, especially in terms of numbers.
 “As far as arenas and stadiums, stadiums hold way more. There is going to be more people around, more following, more gathering. Basketball is more controlled, we can control 15 guys more so than 100. So that is the problem that they have with football and they just didn’t see that happening,” he said.
 Huger believes we should know more around Sept. 16.
 And with many other winter sports, including hockey–– waiting on college basketball’s decision can’t come soon enough.
 “For the mindset, just what we’ve been going through with the pandemic, being locked up basically for six weeks, or six months and not being able to do anything. Then you slowly open up and certain things close back up and now you get them on campus and now it is like we can play and you can’t play and then someone gets sick and everything gets shut down. It’s just so bad for the mindset right now of not knowing,” he said.
 The MAC season is slated to start on Dec. 30 for the women and Jan. 2 for the men. The only thing both teams can do is prepare for a season that is still largely unknown.

Pennsylvanians with intellectual disability/autism have been the pandemic’s forgotten faces. These adults and children are among our most vulnerable citizens. We have a shared interest in making sure that they have the resources to live in their communities rather being relegated to large, state- run institutions.
 Direct support professionals are essential workers who have continued to provide lifesaving services 24/7 under extraordinarily challenging circumstances. They need access to personal protective equipment, child care, and family-sustaining wages.
 Medicaid funds all of these services. Providers face extreme financial difficulties. Some have been compelled to close and furlough staff. Others are on the verge of being forced to shut down.
 Without federal funding, Pennsylvania’s entire community-based system will be at risk of falling apart over the next several months.
 Congress already has acted. The U.S. CARES Act included $175 billion for the Public Health & Social Services Emergency Fund.
 In June, additional funding for home and community-based services was announced. However, the majority of the $87 billion committed has gone to Medicare programs.
 We need a our state congressional delegation, especially Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey, to hold the Department of Health and Human Services accountable for disbursing these funds. Continued delay is unacceptable.
 Congress also must ensure that funding specifically for providers of home and community-based services is included in the fourth-round coronavirus response package.
 Maintaining this system requires sustained increases in federal funding over at least 12-to-18 months. That funding must designate Medicaid providers of long-term supports and services to people with intellectual disabilities/autism as the intended recipients.
 Providers and the families of the individuals we support recognize that direct support professionals are the heart and soul of our state system.
 These men and women provide hands-on care, feeding, bathing, and helping individuals to get dressed. Many direct support professionals become like family to the individuals they support.
 It is tough work and the pandemic has made it even more challenging. Support professionals run the risk of exposure to COVID-19 because they cannot practice social distancing. They work incredible amounts of overtime because, prior to the pandemic, we were grappling with a chronic worker shortage.
 Direct support professionals are essential staff helping people with disabilities remain in their homes, maintain their independence, and stay safe at home and recover more quickly if they do become infected.
 They are underpaid and deserve wages and protections that many health care workers enjoy.
 Providers need additional funding so they can recruit and retain direct support professionals and pay them a fair wage to ensure that all services continue uninterrupted.
 We need action now to compel the release of federal dollars. Additional funding is critical to protect the safety of people with intellectual disability or autism, the direct support professional workforce, and the financial sustainability of essential supports.
 The time to act is now.

While the Supreme Court delivered victories for conservatives on disputes involving religious liberty, the justices struck down a Louisiana abortion restriction and extended workplace protections for LGBTQ people in a pair of losses for the Trump administration. The high court also rejected Mr. Trump's claim of absolute immunity from state criminal proceedings while he's in office in a dispute with the Manhattan district attorney, and sent that case and a second legal battle with House Democrats over his financial records back to the lower courts.
 The president also painted a bleak picture of the future of the Supreme Court should a Democratic president have the opportunity to appoint more justices, warning that if a "radical left movement" is granted a majority, "it will fundamentally transform America."
 Conservatives have been gratified by the president's judicial appointments, which include two justices to the Supreme Court: Justice Neil Gorsuch, who replaced the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who replaced Kennedy and whose appointment cemented the high court's 5-4 conservative majority.
 With crucial assistance from the GOP-controlled Senate, the president has also seen 203 judges confirmed to the federal bench, including 53 to the federal courts of appeals. Mr. Trump's efforts to remake the federal judiciary will likely be among his most enduring legacies, with many of those judges likely to serve decades.
 Mr. Trump vowed to select Supreme Court and lower court jurists in the mold of Scalia, and in releasing an initial list of possible nominees to the high court in 2016, he largely followed through on that promise, winning over a swath of conservative voters who were unsure about voting for him but wanted conservative justices on the bench in the long term.
 According to CBS News exit polling after the last presidential election, 70% of Americans said appointments to the Supreme Court were the most important or an important factor in deciding their vote for president.
 Neither of Mr. Trump's two Supreme Court appointees, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, were on the initial list of 11 possible nominees put forward by the Trump campaign in September 2016, but were added in later iterations.

We have our grain bins to prepare for harvest and we are glad to have those available. We can’t store our complete harvest but it gives us alternatives when it doesn’t all have to go to town in the fall. One drying setup is getting an updated control. I would feel better if that was already done. Harvest will be here all too quickly. Thanks for reading about Douglas County and Midwest agriculture this month.

Democratic nominee Joe Biden pounced on the Woodward revelations, declaring that Trump "lied to the American people. He knowingly and willingly lied about the threat it posed to the country for months."
 "While a deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job — on purpose. It was a life or death betrayal of the American people," Biden said.
 By evening, Trump's own words, captured on the Woodward tapes, had popped up in a Biden campaign ad. The ad includes audio of Trump privately acknowledging to Woodward the severity of COVID-19, and ends with a narrator pronouncing: "Trump knew it all along."
 In a taped Feb. 7 call with Woodward, Trump said of the virus, "You just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus," Trump said.
