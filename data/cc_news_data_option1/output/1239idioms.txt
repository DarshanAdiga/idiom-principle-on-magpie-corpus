FAYETTEVILLE -- Mason Jones, Arkansas Razorbacks 6-foot-3 junior guard, honorable mention All-American and SEC Co-Player of the Year, on Twitter Friday tweeted he is declaring his name in the National Basketball Association 2020 June draft.
 "After much discussion, I have decided to enter my name in the NBA 2020 draft," Jones said. "This has been a lifelong dream of mine to play in the NBA so I'm looking forward to the next chapter in my life."
 Jones' tweet did not fully explain if he would hire an agent, which irrevocably sets his course on turning professional, or if he would work through the NBA Undergraduate Committee which gives collegiate undergrads feedback regarding their NBA prospects and leaves a deadline option to return to college if they so choose.
 However, a statement by Arkansas coach Eric Musselman indicated Jones was foregoing an option to return.
 "Mason had a phenomenal season," Musselman said in a statement. "It came through hours of hard work and dedication as well as a desire to be the best player he could be. Our system gives players the freedom and opportunity to showcase their strengths and Mason took full advantage of it to become one of the top players in college basketball this season. We fully support Mason, and any player, pursuing his dream."
 Jones' tweet thanked Musselman, the basketball staff and fans.
 "Thank you to Coach Muss, UARK MBB staff and teammates for pushing me to be a better person on and off the court," Jones said.
 "Thank you Razorback Nation fans! The best fans in the world! Lastly, thank you to my family and close friends who continue to push and encourage met daily to pursue my dreams."
 A native of DeSoto, Texas where he acknowledged he played overweight while in high school, Jones played one year of junior college ball at Connors State in Oklahoma before transferring as a sophomore to former Arkansas coach Mike Anderson's 18-16 Razorbacks in 2018-19. Jones played in every game totally scoring 463 points and per game averaging 13.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.8 assists.
 For Musselman's 2019-20 Razorbacks, 20-12 with the season canceled by the coronanavirus national emergency after Arkansas' first-round SEC Tournament, Jones earned First-Team All-SEC on both the coaches and AP media All-SEC teams and along with Mississippi State forward Reggie Perry named SEC Co-Player of the Year upon leading the Razorbacks with 683 points for a 22.0 average, and team leading rebounds 169, 5.5 average, assists, 106, 3.9 and steals, 50 for a 1.6 average.
 Jones was the first Razorback simultaneously leading the Razorbacks in scoring, rebounding, steals and assists since All-American and Naismith and Collegiate Hall of Famer Sidney Moncrief in 1979.
 Both a 3-point shooting threat and even more a get-fouled driver, Jones for 2019-20 led the nation in free throws made and attempted, 233 of 282.
 If Jones does sign with an agent, he apparently will become the second among the 2019-20 Razorbacks not returning for 2020-21.
 Arkansas senior-to-be guard and 2-year letterman Jalen Harris has put his name in the graduate transfer portal.
 Arkansas women's basketball coach Mike Neighbors said that two off his 24-8 Razorbacks, A'Tyanna Gaulden and Rokia Doumbia, have put their names in the graduate transfer portal.
 Gaulden, originally a freshman at Florida State transferred and redshirting at Arkansas 2017-18 has one year graduate transfer eligibility remaining after lettering for two Arkansas seasons.
 This past season Gaulden averaged 16.8 minutes per game alternating off the bench with freshman point guard Makayla Daniels.
 Doumbia, transferring as a junior, increased her off the bench time as a 5-9 guard/small forward from 19 games and 119 minutes as a 2018-19 freshman to 29 games and 463 minutes in 2019-20.
 Both contributed to the nationally No. 24 Razorbacks, 10-6 in the SEC tied for third, achieve the second 10 SEC win season in their history and what would have been a NCAA Tournament berth before the season was canceled.

Spring is usually the hotel’s busiest season, Fujii said, with Japanese companies renting out conference space and banquet rooms to hold training seminars and parties for their new hires. The hotel is near the bustling Shin- Osaka Station, a transport hub for western Japan.
 But with the coronavirus curtailing travel and disrupting businesses across Japan, room bookings are down to a third of what they were last year, Fujii said. The postponement of the Tokyo Olympic Games, originally scheduled to take place this summer, is also likely to devastate smaller businesses in Japan reliant on tourism and disrupt the economy at large.
 Hotels with less unfortunate names than the Corona have not been spared either. Across the nation, hotels have seen a drastic fall in bookings as countries restrict travel to stem the spread of the virus and the Japanese government discourages people from unnecessary travel.

 FUNKE, James Eric January 20, 1949 to March 12, 2020 James died of a heart attack at the age of 71 on Thursday, March 12, 2020. Much as he is missed by the many people he touched during his lifetime, we are grateful that he went quickly and escaped before the worst of the coronavirus turmoil. He died while doing one of the things he loved most in the world, helping others. James was preceded in death by his parents, Genevieve and Richard Funke, and his son Jamie (Jameson). James was born in Reading, PA and grew up in surrounding small towns where he was a star quarterback in high school football and enjoyed escapades with his two brothers, Richard and Michael. After returning home from the Vietnam War, James settled in Boston for 10 years. It was here that he became deeply involved with the Spiritualist Church, received his undergraduate degree in music from Goddard College and his Masters in Social Work from Boston College. He then heeded his soul's call to Go West, young man. After a few years in Skagit County, WA, his veteran status and MSW landed him a job at Fairchild Airforce Base in Spokane. He remained in Spokane the rest of his life, during which time he worked as a clinical social worker at the Veteran's Outreach Center for 20 years, married Cheryl Husa, raised their two sons Jamie and Andy, later remarried to Susanne Croft, and eventually retired from the VA due to Agent Orange related heart disease. He continued in private practice to provide EMDR therapeutic counseling on a part-time basis, most recently under the business name of Inner Peace Counseling, aptly named as that's what he most sought to bring to his clients as well as himself, the classic Wounded Healer. James was an accomplished musician, playing guitar, cittern, concertina and his great love hurdy gurdy. He was especially fond of Celtic and Renaissance music. A frequent performer at local venues, he was also often seen at regional Renaissance festivals where he held forth in full regalia. He was an original co-founder of the Celtic Nots and afterward formed other musical groups with some of Spokane's best musicians. He used James Funke-Loubigniac as his performing name, adding in his mother's maiden name as a nod to the hurdy gurdy's French heritage. While an Irish wake would be a fitting way to bid adieu to this kind and generous soul, the current social distancing guidelines require that a memorial for James be delayed until we can all gather as we would like. Those interested in receiving notice of that future event can register by searching for Memorial for James E. Funke on Facebook. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his memory may be made to the Spokane chapter of NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness).

In some U.S. states, golf, guns and marijuana have been ruled essential, raising eyebrows and — in the case of guns — a good deal of ire.
 In many places, booze is also on the list of essentials. Britain at first kept liquor stores off its list of businesses allowed to remain open, but after reports of supermarkets running out of beer, wine and spirits, the government quickly added them.
 "Recent events clearly demonstrate that the process of designating 'essential services' is as much about culture as any legal-political reality about what is necessary to keep society functioning," said Christopher McKnight Nichols, associate professor of history at Oregon State University.
 Countries including India and U.S. states are listing the information technology sector as essential. The world's dependence on the internet has become even more apparent as countless people confined to their homes communicate, stream movies and play games online to stave off cabin fever.
 Several states where marijuana is legal, such as California and Washington, deemed pot shops and workers in the market's supply chain essential. For some, the emphasis is on medicinal uses, not enabling cooped-up people to get stoned.
 "Cannabis is a safe and effective treatment that millions of Americans rely on to maintain productive daily lives while suffering from diseases and ailments," Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in an email. "It is the very definition of essential that these individuals can still access their medicine at this time."
 Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont added gun shops to his list of essential businesses, generating shock and dismay among families of gun violence victims. His spokesman Max Reiss said Lamont is trying not to overly disrupt commerce or interfere with legal rights.
 Newtown Action Alliance, a group formed after a gunman killed 26 people in 2012 at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, urged Lamont to reconsider, noting a recent surge in gun and ammunition purchases. The group predicted an "increased number of deaths due to unintentional shootings, homicides and suicides."
 Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a legal opinion Friday saying emergency orders in his state can't restrict gun sales.
 "If you have a breakdown in society, well then our first line to defend ourselves is ourselves, so I think having a weapon … is very important for your personal safety," Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told a radio interviewer.
 Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday quietly allowed gun shops to reopen, but only by appointment during limited hours if customers and employees comply with social distancing and other protective measures.
 There is a lot of variation across the United States because a national stay- at-home order has not been issued, said Benjamin Clark, associate professor of planning, public policy and management at the University of Oregon.
 "We end up with places making up the rules that are culturally or geographically specific," Clark said. "This is why we see so much variation, and potential risk."
 In Europe, the current epicenter of the pandemic, Italy has the most stringent rules, with only essential businesses such as food shops and pharmacies remaining open. The manufacturing sector was ordered shut down on Thursday, though factories that make needed products like medical supplies will continue to operate after making conditions safer for employees.
 Britain, which was initially reluctant to shut down business, has issued orders to close nonessential operations. Restaurants and eateries must be shut, but Britons can still get fish and chips and other meals, as long as they are carry-out.
 In France, shops specializing in pastry, wine and cheese have been declared essential businesses.
 In a nod to Israel's vibrant religious life, people can gather for outdoor prayers — with a maximum of 10 worshipers standing 2 meters (2 yards) apart. Demonstrations — also allowed — have occurred outside parliament and the Supreme Court, with participants maintaining social distance.
 "In times of uncertainty, institutions and practices that are central to the cultural identities can become really important touchstones — material markers of certainty, comfort, and mechanisms to persist," said Aimee Huff, marketing professor at Oregon State University, specializing in consumer culture.
 In China, authorities closed most businesses and public facilities beginning in late January but kept open hospitals, supermarkets and pharmacies. Truck drivers delivering food, disinfectant and medical supplies to locked-down cities were hailed as heroes. Now, the ruling Communist Party is relaxing restrictions to revive the economy after declaring victory over the outbreak.
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing conditions, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.
 In the United States, lobbyists have been trying to influence what gets on lists of essential services, so their clients' businesses can remain open.
 "They were absolutely earning their pay" in Connecticut, said Reiss, the governor's spokesman. He noted lobbyists for manufacturers and the golf course industry were particularly active.
 Despite their efforts, golf wasn't deemed essential in Connecticut. But Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey included golf courses on his list. Officials in Phoenix encouraged the city's 1.7 million residents to "get outside, get exercise and practice responsible social distancing" in golf courses, parks and trails.
 Mayors of five other Arizona cities pushed back, telling Ducey that including golf courses and payday lenders was taking the definition of essential too far.
 In California, construction executives and others lobbied state officials to get construction exempted from the stay-at-home mandate, the Sacramento Bee reported. State health officials responded by including all construction as essential.
 If construction in America's most populous state stalls — as it it did during the Great Recession — it would be difficult to restart, said Erika Bjork of the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, which advocated for the industry.
 "We need to keep this engine humming, so when we come out of this we have housing," Bjork said.
 Like Britain, some U.S. states allowed liquor stores to remain open, including New Mexico, which routinely ranks first in alcohol-related deaths per capita.
 State health officials were concerned that shutting them down would result in people with alcoholism seeking emergency medical attention, taking resources away from the coronavirus, said Tripp Stelnicki, a spokesman for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
 In New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Sununu said flower shops are among the essentials.
 Asked why, spokesman Ben Vihstadt said they provide essential services for funeral homes.

 Ann went to the Lord on March 20, 2020 and is now with her beloved husband, Bob. Born February 22, 1936, the youngest of three daughters, to a Texas A&M; dairyman and his wife, Ann grew up in College Station, Texas. Stories of her childhood as an adorable curly headed blonde never failed to entertain - some favorites are of a cherished pet turkey, Henrietta, which she and her sisters dressed in doll clothes and who would then meet them at the school bus every day. It seems fitting that Ann's college alma mater, Texas A&I; Kingsville, would later become part of the Texas A&M; system for she always felt she was raised an honorary Aggie. Upon graduation with a business degree, she moved to Houston to go into banking where she met the love of her life - Oklahoman Bob W. Coleman. Ann and Bob married and moved to San Antonio where their legend takes shape in an adopted city, they loved with all their hearts. Bob and Ann worked as partners through their strong call to give back to the world. Bob, a successful entrepreneur, couldn't have built his businesses without Ann's help. Their most notable achievement was Texace, a local golf cap corporation, with which they were able to travel around the world. Friends and associates characterized Ann as not the woman behind the man but the woman very much beside the man, working as a partner to Bob in all their business and philanthropic ventures - and what quiet, yet powerful, philanthropists they were in every facet of the community! They established the non-profit San Antonio Sports and were the driving force behind the collaborative that kept the San Antonio Spurs in the Alamo City in the 1990's. In Bob's short stint as interim CEO with the Spurs, they traveled with the team in the glory days of David Robinson and Sean Elliot. Bob and Ann spearheaded the development of the Alamodome and helped secure sporting events as the Junior Olympics, the Final Four, and the Alamobowl. Their sports and educational foundations and scholarships exist today, changing the lives of those they will never meet for generations. Ann loved golf - she and Bob spent many great years with friends on the course as members of Oak Hills Country Club, where they owned a home on the 17th green. Later, they moved to an Atlee Ayres' historic home in Monte Vista in order to host political fundraisers and parties, where they were beloved members of the neighborhood. Their D'Hanis ranch was Ann's favorite getaway and host of the best family memories, where they spent nearly every available weekend, fishing, walking and bird-hunting. However, there is no question Ann and Bob's greatest passion was Sooner football! As an alumnus, Bob reserved a special place in his heart for the University of Oklahoma but it could be said Ann came to love it just as much or more. They never missed a football season and made some of their closest friends at the Santee lounge at the stadium. One of their greatest prides was when their great-niece Cristina graduated from OU. Their philanthropy extended here to a building that sports their name and countless scholarships as well as a foundation. Ann's life of generosity has and will continue to change the Alamo City and University of Oklahoma forever. Her sharp wit and kindness will be missed by all those who loved her. Ann is survived by her stepson Brock Coleman of San Antonio, his wife Shelby and their children, Maci, Braden and Haley; her niece and goddaughter, Linda Zimmerhanzel of San Antonio and great- nieces Cristina O'Donnell, Kathryn Zimmerhanzel and Kelly Zimmerhanzel; and sister, Frances Smith of Bryan, TX and her husband John. Services are TBD. Charitable donations can be made to the University of Oklahoma Foundation at 100 Kimberdell, Norman, OK 78072 or San Antonio Sports at P.O.

 James L. Dublinski 1932-2020 James L. Dublinski, Jimmy D, our dear husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, brother, uncle and friend, passed away peacefully at home on March 23, 2020 at the age of 88. We will greatly miss this man of integrity and honor and full of love for family and friends. Born in Chicago to Thomas Michael Dublinski and Rose Mary Jellen, Jim and his brother Tom grew up during a time when the milkman delivered glass quart bottles in a horse drawn wagon and the iceman delivered ice blocks in a pushcart. Jim was raised in a devout Catholic family and attended Catholic schools. He developed a strong work ethic early on, which also helped him excel in sports, a gift that landed him a scholarship at the University of Utah, where he lettered as a member of the football team. After college, Jim joined the Washington Redskins, yet was released due to injury after three games. He was then drafted into the Army in April of 1954 and was stationed at Fort Ord, California, where he also played football. He met his first wife, Joan Soukup, in the Spring of 1956. They were married in 1958 and raised their two children, Jim and Julie, in Riverside, Illinois. Jim worked for Proctor & Gamble and then started his own successful food brokerage firm. Jim and Joan enjoyed traveling the globe together. After 37 wonderful years of marriage, Joan passed away suddenly in December of 1994. Jim decided to attend a fraternity reunion at the University of Utah. It was at this time, he reconnected with Ardys Mason, his college sweetheart. An old college romance was soon rekindled, and they married on December 30th, 1995 in Salt Lake City. This was also the time that Jim became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and he and Ardys were sealed to each other in the Johannesburg Temple in South Africa by Ardys's brother, James O. Mason. Jim and Ardys served a Church Public Affairs mission in New York City where they worked closely with the United Nations Diplomatic Corps. Upon returning to Salt Lake City, they settled into Ardys's home where they spent many wonderful years together, hosting frequent family gatherings and enjoying great relationships with many dear friends and neighbors. Jim was the recipient of many sports accolades, but what mattered most to those who knew and loved him was he always made you feel better, even when he crushed you in a card game. Like clockwork, every child and grandchild received a Jimmy D card on every birthday and holiday. His cards will be greatly missed. Jim is survived by his beloved wife, Ardys Mason Dublinski, his children, Jim (Noan) Dublinski, Julie (Ron) Shay, his stepchildren Sabrina (Kurt) Imig, Margit (Brian) Herring and Michael (Kristen) von Rosen, and a fan club of 12 grandchildren and 7 great- grandchildren. Dad, Jimmy D, you will be missed! Go Utes!

Muzaffarpur (Bihar) [India], Mar 29 (ANI): An FIR has been registered against the Labour Superintendent of Muzaffarpur on Saturday for not attending an important meeting regarding the movement of migrant labourers in light of the coronavirus situation.   According to an FIR copy, Vinay Kumar, Labour Superintendent, Muzaffarpur, was booked under Sections 2, 3 and 4 of The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, for failing to show up at an important meeting despite repeated instructions.   The copy stated that a meeting was convened on Saturday by the District Magistrate Dr Chandrasekhar Singh regarding the migrant labourers, wherein he sought the help of all district officers to provide assistance to the labourers in the wake of rising cases of COVID-19.   However, when Kumar failed to show up at the meeting at 1 PM, he was contacted through telephone, where he said that he could attend the meeting as he was in Patna on that day. Following this, when he was asked to be present in the District Headquarters without delay to provide assistance to the migrant labourers, he plainly refused to attend.   The FIR copy informed that Kumar was in Patna from the day of lockdown, while he was deputed to the control room of Sadar Hospital, Muzaffarpur. Furthermore, he was on unauthorised leave from the District Headquarters.   The DM saw this as a grave situation, which depicted his indiscipline, arbitrariness and unprofessional behaviour towards senior officials.   Migrant workers in very large numbers have been trekking back to their villages on foot from Delhi and other cities owing to the paucity of work following the nationwide lockdown. The lockdown was announced by the Central government on Tuesday to prevent the spread of coronavirus. (ANI)

Jeffrey W. Bogaard   1952 ~ 2020   On Friday, March 20, 2020, Jeffrey William Bogaard, loving husband and father, died at the age of 67, after a long battle with cancer.   Jeffrey was born on September 8, 1952 to Clem and Beverly (Reese) Bogaard. He leaves behind his beloved wife Loretta, daughter Kali (Jeff), step-children Jennifer (Scott) and Kevin, siblings Diane (deceased), Sandy, and Neil, and grandchildren Bayla, Olivia, and Jack.   Jeff spent most of his working life as a financial planner where he cherished the relationships he formed with his clients. He retired from Planning Pathways (Plan 4 Wealth) in June 2019.   Jeff had a passion for the outdoors and picking up new hobbies. He was a college gymnast, a triathlete, a race car driver, and a member of the Intermountain Porsche Club. He was an avid cook who was always trying new recipes, particularly on his charcoal grill, and loved refining his home brewed beer. His most recent pursuit was perfecting his game on the Frisbee golf course.   But most importantly, Jeff had a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures in life; a quiet trail in the company of one of his cherished pets, the perfect turn at his favorite ski mountain, a secluded campsite with a beautiful view of the desert, and time spent around the table or campfire with family and friends. His quick wit and subtle sense of humor will be missed by all who knew him.   In light of current social distancing recommendations, no memorial services will be held at this time. A remembrance will be held online at http://www.starksfuneral.com/obituaries where friends and family are invited to share their memories.

If you don’t have any income right now, make a budget based on the amount of money on hand. If you have $600 left to your name, budget out exactly where each of those dollars will go. It’s time to squeeze every last penny out of what you’ve got. If you still have cash coming in from a spouse’s job or some other source, then adjust your budget to reflect that. Maybe the two of you usually bring in a combined $5,000 a month. Adjust your budget to live off that one income for the time being.
 When the going gets tough, you need to focus on the things you really need to survive — food, utilities, shelter and transportation. I call these the Four Walls. If there’s any money left over after you take care of the Four Walls, make a list of what else you need to pay and tackle those in order of importance. Reach out to anyone you can’t pay and explain the situation. They might be able to work something out, but they can’t help if they don’t know. Be up front with them, and pray for the best.

Mayor takes appropriate action on virus
   
 I was impressed that Mayor Van Johnson set down some very challenging but necessary limits in an effort to thwart the escalated advance of the COVID-19 virus in our community. He had the courage to say that people needed to stay home except for essential outings and that businesses that were not essential must close for the time being. This message is what I had hoped to hear from our governor, Brian Kemp, but he clearly lacks the fortitude to take a strong stand.
   
 I was relieved to hear Mayor Johnson so rationally tell us to do what was difficult but scientifically and medically required. If we buckle down for the uncomfortable task of staying home for a couple weeks, we may be able to avoid months of semi-lockdown, which surely impedes our freedom far more in the long run. I know that I do not want to live as we have been recently for many months to come.
   
 Perhaps and hopefully, our compliance with the recent stricter orders will bring about a more hasty return to normalcy.

 On the last night before the Spanish state of emergency went into effect, in the only restaurant in the village atop the narrow valley, people gathered for a birthday party.
 The television was blasting scenes of coronavirus panic in Madrid, but nobody was paying attention to it, or the slow roll of the impending crisis.
 Aside from that wall-mounted television, Comidas Caseras de Carmen (Carmen's Homemade Food), felt like an eatery from a different century. As soon as you take a seat, Carmen sets down a large flask of wine and a pitcher of water, and then asks what you want to drink. Her only other question is what kind of meat.
 Beyond that the menu is set. First comes a mound of lettuce topped with fresh raw veggies and drizzled with pomegranate dressing. Then, a steaming vat of soup and a stack of bowls. You ladle the soup and pass around the bowls.
 The soup changes daily. In my three visits I had cocido de hinojos, made with fennel and white bean; sopa de mariscos, a seafood soup thick with mussels, clams, squid and fish; and salmorejo, a cold, pureed gazpacho.
 After the soup comes a skillet of papas alins, potatoes cooked in sherry and olive oil. Decadently soft and impregnated with oil, they are so incredibly edible that the average diner waves the white flag before the skillet is half empty if they don't pace themselves.
 Then come the meats. The rabbit tastes like chicken. The chicken is cooked in a Dijon turmeric sauce. The goat is in stew form, and includes pieces of liver. My favorite was the lamb, salted and grilled. I washed down the melted fat with big gulps of wine from the bottomless flask.
 Finally comes dessert, usually natillas -- a type of Spanish flan with a cookie on top -- or avocado mousse, which tastes like vanilla custard with your eyes closed. Anyone who wants could have an espresso with dessert.
 My last taste of Carmen's homemade food was takeout that we ate on our rooftop terrace in the hamlet of Guajar-Faraguit, just down the valley from Carmen's. She had packed my food in Tupperware, and my wine filled a plastic liter soda bottle. When I returned the next night to bring back the dishes, the restaurant seemed more festive than usual, and her sister was more dressed up. Some motorcycles roared to a stop outside, and several guests ran out, returning with boxes. An octopus-like cake holder appeared, and within moments each arm held a cake.
 The birthday girl posed with each guest in front of the ornate cake rack. All the while, on the screen behind them, the news blasted updates of the impending lockdown. As she kissed her mother, I hoped I wasn't witnessing a kiss of death.
 The next time I drove by Carmen's, it was shuttered. The villages are now silent, but this eerie silence is comforting. Spain does not want to go the way of Italy with COVID-19, and the citizens and authorities are taking it seriously. During our stay there in March, we were stopped by the police while on a grocery run. People kept their distance on the near-empty sidewalks as if scared of being mugged. One person at a time was allowed in each shop. I had my money sprayed with bleach after paying. Many locals were waiting out the epidemic in their mountain huts, next to olive groves where there is always work to do.
 Luckily, nobody stopped us from hiking in the mountains, and I stayed busy in the kitchen trying to recreate Carmen's culinary magic. I will leave you with the potato recipe for now. This summer, when it's hot, I'll drop the avocado mousse and salmorejo recipes. And when fennel is available, and nobody knows what to do with it, I'll give you the recipe for cocido de hinojas.
 This is my version of papas alins and not the official one, or Carmen's. I started making it my way because I hadn't realized it's usually made with sherry, which I couldn't find in the valley. But like the rest of Spain, and the rest of the world, we adjust and improvise when we have to. You can find the official version of this dish online, but my family has fallen in love with mine.
 Papas Alins in the time of COVID-19   Makes 2 servings   • 1 pound potatoes, sliced about ½-inch thick   • 1 cup olive oil   • 4 whole cloves garlic   • 1/2 green bell pepper, sliced   • 1/2 sweet red pepper, sliced   • Optional extras: olives, carrot slices
 Heat the oil on low/medium, add the potatoes, and let them slowly poach at a gentle simmer. If they stick above the oil a bit it's OK, because soon they will soften, shrink and sink.
 Unlike with fries, where sogginess means failure, here we want the oil to impregnate the soft potatoes. But if you cook them long enough a crust will form that serves to hold in the flavored oils. It's not authentic, but it's a nice touch.
 After about 10 minutes add the peppers, garlic and any other veggies you might care to. Move things around so the new veggies are submerged, and keep simmering until the peppers shrink and the air smells like a fragrant mix of potatoes and peppers. Strain the oil and serve.

Spring has sprung, the days are getting longer, the weather is getting warmer and the flowers are opening. As a child, I remember early spring as being a riot of color and the air being filled with the sound of birds singing louder as they returned after a cold winter. The air also had a different scent and feel; I guess more humidity returning to the air. Anyway, one knew spring was on its way. It was fun to anticipate when the first signs of brown bushes would explode into color.      As spring approaches, so do some of my favorite flowering shrubs. These early spring flowering plants brighten up the landscape (as well as my mood). I am crazy about some of the new shrubs that flower in March and April, but I cannot forget about the ones that I recall from my childhood. Those that created the nostalgic memories that I cherish.      I was one of five girls and we all walked to school, as did all of our friends. As you walked, you tended to notice more. We passed by houses that had some of the same shrubs in their garden that we had in ours. People in those days did not have very sophisticated bushes; the houses with prettier yards were because of the placement of plants rather than having unusual plant material.      As I think back on what blooming shrubs we had to look forward to, the vibrant yellow flowers of two shrubs come to mind first. Forsythia was in many gardens and a few people had another one named Kerria japonica, or Japanese rose as some called it, which bloomed shortly after the forsythia finished flowering. Both have long arching branches and make a magnificent display of color. Forsythia flowered first and was like a ray of sunshine after the dark days of winter.   The brightly colored flowers that covered the branches opened to a profusion of blooms. Then, not too long after the forsythia turned green with the new foliage, kerria would take center stage. With those long arching branches of brilliant yellow blooms, who could help but enjoy them. Both of these are extremely hardy and so easy to grow that I am sure that is why most homes grew them.      Another old-fashioned shrub is quince. I love quince not only because of my childhood memories but for other reasons too. Most of the ones that I saw growing up had red flowers and many people had this plant somewhere in their yard. The old-fashioned varieties had fruit that resembled apples. They were quite bitter and, as children, we would dare someone to take a bite of the fruit. People would make jam from the bitter, apple looking fruit that would be present in the summer. Today, the quince I grow does not have the large fruit that I remember. I guess that has been bred out of the newer varieties.      Today, I grow three different quince bushes and they are some of my favorite plants, but it is for a different reason. It might not be the prettiest bush when it is not flowering, but I love it because it is easy to force into bloom. I pick branches starting in early December and bring them in the house to open up. I do this about every two weeks after that so that I have a continuous arrangement of them blooming in the house. When I pick the first branches, it takes them longer to open, but after Christmas, it takes less and less time for them to open when I bring them into the house since they are getting closer to the time when they would naturally open.      People think I am so talented for having these flowers in the house, but all it takes is to remember to pick them and bring them in to open up. Try it next winter and you, too, will be rewarded with an abundance of flowers. The branches I do not pick look pretty over a long time in the garden. You can find quince in white, pink, red and an orange-red.      Now, if fragrance is a trait you really want to have in your garden, you cannot beat the fragrance of Daphne and Korean spice viburnum. Daphne is a low growing evergreen shrub with a wonderful fragrance that when brought in the house, will perfume a room.      Korean spice viburnum is a flowering bush that is so aromatic that it fills the air with a lovely scent when in bloom. The buds are pinkish in color and then give way to white flowers. My daughter, Laura, gave me the bush that I presently have and I think of her each time it is in flower. This somewhat larger shrub produces clusters of dainty, pastel-pink buds in late March and the spicy fragrance alone is worth growing this delightful shrub.      I do not know what plants stir up memories of your childhood, maybe you remember some of these jewels. I hope you enjoy spring and the waking up of the trees and shrubs and enjoy those lovely sounds that fill the air. I certainly do.

MIAMI (AP) — Tiz the Law won a very unusual Florida Derby on Saturday at Gulfstream Park, where fans and owners weren't permitted because of the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Tiz the Law's win came on a day where Aqueduct in New York canceled the rest of its racing schedule for March and April and announced that it would be converted to a temporary hospital.MIAMI (AP) — The Miami Dolphins want to keep their newly acquired free agents safe at home. Because of the new coronavirus, the team arranged media interviews via Zoom for eight newcomers scattered around the country. Athletes have often sought to keep a safe distance from the media. But Zoom is a new conduit in the relationship, reflecting the rising popularity of video chat services in this time of isolation. The Dolphins turned to Zoom because they knew their newly acquired players would not be able to meet with the South Florida media in person anytime soon.UNDATED (AP) — Nobody knows when NBA players will be in a game again, with the season on hold because of the global coronavirus pandemic.

But the workouts, somehow, must continue. It is just part of the new series of challenges for NBA teams to figure out in these uncertain times.

Celia is set to debut in six markets (including the UK), initially coming to just the P40 series before rolling out to other devices (I would guess the recently-announced Sound X speaker is also on the cards). That's a big barrier of entry, since there isn't a standalone device people can pick up and use Celia with - as was the case with Alexa and the Echo. Plus the cheapest P40 phone is €799 (UK pricing still hasn't been announced), and that has the added disadvantage of not coming with any Google services.

In light of such statistics, it would be naïve to think that the number of daily new cases in the country would reach a safe level when the MCO and EMCO periods end on 14.4.2020 and as such, the possibility that it may be further extended cannot be dismissed.

I think part of the problem is that even if they are staying inside, people in NYC are living in buildings with a lot of people. If you're in stores you're with a lot of people. Also, Cuomo said the reason it exploded in NYC is because they "welcome people from around the world." In other words, perhaps they shouldn't have criticized a travel ban. And for a while, De Blasio encouraged people to go out and about and not be afraid of the virus (implying it would be racist to stay in).

Easier said than done, granted. However, the key is to set the wheels in motion. The rest will follow. Proper evaluation and feedback procedures will help steer the ship and ensure that the programme is delivering tangible results. One must also be mindful of differences between genders and minorities when rolling out the programme which should be as inclusive as possible. Research conducted found lower scores in financial literacy for females when compared to males and also lower scores when comparing minorities to more privileged groups. If we aren’t being proactive about this, any new programme won’t be immune to creating the same gaps seen elsewhere.

You can still go outside for basic exercise once a day, provided you are doing so in a way that meets the latest guidance on social distancing and advice on unnecessary social contact.
 That means you can do this by yourself or with your household, not in groups.
 The government wants people to remain fit and active but it may be that people have to find new ways to remain active, in their own homes or by exercising alone, reports Wales Online.
 Cabinet minister Michael Gove explained that people shouldn’t be playing golf in light of the exercise restrictions.
 He said that people should be defining exercise as “one walk, one run or one cycle per day”.
 As for fishing, many fisheries across the country have had to close despite the season just getting up and running.
 Russell Owen, fishery manager at Llyn Clywedog, near Llanidloes, said: “We were forced to close on Monday.
 “We lease the fishing rights from Severn and Trent Water and they made a decision to close all their sites.
 “At the weekend there were a lot of people in their open spaces and we were busy here at the weekend too.
 “We have five members of staff who have been told to stay at home at the moment and we have got nearly 80,000 fish that need feeding.
 “We have been open for about the last fortnight ready for the season and we normally get 12,500 visitors normally between March and October.
 “We are mostly busy at weekends and we get a lot of people coming down from all over Wales and lots of people from the Midlands too.
 “This is also going to have an impact on the local guesthouses and pubs where these people would normally go and put money into the local economy.”

Editor's note: Each Saturday while the Georgia General Assembly is in session, the Savannah Morning News will publish a column written by a member of the Savannah-area legislative delegation.
   
 Across the nation and throughout the world, we are united with concern regarding COVID-19. The spread of this disease is having an unprecedented ripple effect, not only causing illness and death for thousands, but also triggering negative consequences on our economy as businesses close or significantly reduce their workforce.
   
 As families across our state adjust to these difficult circumstances, Georgia's officials have been proactive, working together for solutions. We are both concerned and engaged - the General Assembly voted to give the governor state of emergency powers, with $100 million earmarked for the Georgia Department of Labor (GDOL). This week alone, more unemployment claims are being submitted in Georgia than during the 2008-2009 recession. Because of this high volume, the GDOL is asking for your patience as they process claims as quickly as possible.
   
 And while the GDOL experiences this significant increase in activity while the virus is still uncontained, for the protection of GDOL employees and those submitting claims, the GDOL has suspended in-person requirements for filing. Following Gov. Brian Kemp's recommendation, the GDOL is providing online access to unemployment services, partial claim access for employers, and other reemployment services. Employers who anticipate layoffs or hourly reductions will be mandated to file partial claims on behalf of their employees.
   
 It's also important to note that last year, the General Assembly raised the unemployment payment from $330 to $365 a week, thanks to leadership from State Labor Commissioner Mark Butler. Commissioner Butler also extended the benefit from 14 weeks to 26 weeks and removed the first $300 earned in a week from paid unemployment benefits. This is especially important for those who have a side job that pays weekly but isn't a primary source of income. In addition, employers and non-profit organizations who pay unemployment tax premiums will not see an increase in their premiums because of layoffs related to coronavirus.
   
 As I write this, the federal government has announced a COVID-19 emergency fund package with weekly supplemental payments of $600 for part-time, self- employed "gig" workers - independent workers who are paid by task. Those who are still unemployed after state benefits end could get an additional 13 weeks of help from the federal government.
   
 One thing this invisible enemy is teaching us is that we're all connected and we're all in this together. These are hard times, but state and federal leaders are working around the clock for solutions in an ever-evolving situation. The General Assembly has always maintained a fiscally responsible, balanced budget, with an emergency fund set aside for times such as this.
   
 Please do your part by heeding local guidelines and helping to contain this disease. We have the power to protect each other and significantly stop the spread, and as soon as we do so we can return to our normal lives. Share accurate, helpful news about job openings and assistance, such as the information outlined above, so we can help each other get back on our feet as soon as possible.
   
 Whether you're a Bulldawg or Ramblin' Wreck, city-dweller or marsh lover, together we'll get through this with true Georgia resiliency.
