Cloud broadcasting is a cloud based content delivery model in which Over the Top (OTT) television services are distributed through a cloud platform. With the globalization of the broadcast industry, content broadcasting has become more expensive and complex over time. Broadcasting companies use globally distributed teams and content including animation, graphics, video, and audio to serve geographically diversified viewers. But larger the audience, the more difficult it is for broadcasting services providers to manage the global operations cost effectively. Further, traditional broadcasting channels such as optical fiber and satellite are extremely expensive options. Nonetheless, proliferation of internet has made it possible to deliver required content on various platforms including OTT, DTH (Direct to Home), VOD (Video on Demand), IPTV (Internet Protocol television), and mobile. In cloud broadcasting, instead of streaming everything through satellite, media assets such as audio and video files are stored on cloud for further distribution.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The wife of Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang says she was sexually assaulted by her OB-GYN while she was pregnant with the couple's first child. Evelyn Yang said in an interview televised Thursday by CNN that the assault happened in 2012, and she was initially afraid to tell anyone. She and 31 other women are now suing the doctor and hospital system, saying they conspired and enabled the crimes. Yang said she she was encouraged to speak out after seeing the positive reception she and her husband had been getting on the campaign trail by being open about their son's autism. \"Something about being on the trail and meeting people and seeing the difference that we've been making already has moved me to share my own story about it, about sexual assault,\" she told CNN. Yang said she first began seeing Dr. Robert Hadden in New York in early 2012. As the months went on, Yang said, Hadden began asking her inappropriate questions about her sexual activity, and he spent more time conducting examinations. When she was seven months pregnant, Yang said, she believed her appointment was done and she was getting ready to leave when the doctor told her abruptly that he thought she might need a cesarean section. She said Hadden pulled her to him and undressed her, then used his fingers to examine her internally. “I knew it was wrong. I knew I was being assaulted,” she said. But Yang said she “just kind of froze” and didn't react. “I remember trying to fix my eyes on a spot on the wall and just trying to avoid seeing his face as he was assaulting me, just waiting for it to be over,\" she told CNN. After the doctor left the room, she left the practice and didn't return. Hadden's lawyer has denied Yang's allegations in legal filings. His attorney...

 SOUTH YARMOUTH -- The Dennis-Yarmouth School Building Committee began the tough job of paring $5 million from plans for the new regional middle school Thursday, working from a list of possible cuts put together by project architects and management team members.
 Although no final decisions were made, the list of possible cuts ranged from a $30,000 change from metal paneling to drywall for the ceiling in the school vestibule to a $2.2 million synthetic turf sports field.
 The plan to build a $117 million school for Dennis and Yarmouth students had been stalled by litigation for about a year.
 Plans call for the school to house grades 4-7 on a district-owned site on Station Avenue in South Yarmouth, replacing the aging Mattacheese Middle School in West Yarmouth and Nathaniel H. Wixon School in South Dennis.
 Steadily rising construction costs while two court challenges to the project played out have meant that $5 million must now be slashed from the bottom line before final plans can be drawn.
 Thursday marked a first run-through of project costs for the building committee, which had not met in more than a year. Reductions were not formally voted on, but project managers from PMA Consultants will use the list to show officials at the Massachusetts School Building Authority that it is possible to get the project back in the black.
 Reductions could not affect the educational plan the construction project was developed to meet. They also were made to areas where costs are not reimbursible via the $44 million in state funding.
 The proposed reductions include a change in curb materials from granite to precast concrete; elimination of a $446,500 irrigation system at all athletics fields with the intention of seeking alternative ways to pay for the system; a change in athletic field material from sod to seed to recoup about $200,000; elimination of a planned soccer field at the Station Avenue front; 50% reduction in fitness course equipment; reduction of 50% in plantings; and reduction in lockers to 50% of the enrollment to save $95,000.
 Chad Crittendon, of PMA Consultants, ran through the list for the building committee. Sitting on that panel are two selectmen from each town, town administrators, Dennis-Yarmouth teachers and school administrators, schools Superintendent Carol Woodbury and Assistant Superintendent Kenneth Jenks, and some members at large.
 Schematic designs for the new school are finished, but final designs must be drawn by May 5. Before that can be done, architects at Perkins Eastman have to know what is being eliminated. The building committee is expected to formally vote on its recommendations Feb. 13.
 Construction bid packages will go out early next year, with a February 2021 deadline for bid submissions, if the project stays on track.
 Construction should start shortly after that. The school will likely be ready to move into by late 2022.

 SILVER CITY | Representatives of a gold exploration company who want to drill in the Black Hills tried to win over a skeptical crowd Tuesday night in the quiet hamlet of Silver City.
 A standing-room audience of about 75 people crammed into the picturesque former schoolhouse known as the Silver City Community Hall to listen and ask questions of officials including Rob Bergmann and Brian Lentz. They are the president and vice president of F3 Gold, a Minneapolis-based exploration and prospecting company. Bergmann and Lentz are also principals in Big Rock Exploration, a technical consulting firm.

Any potential gold mine developed to capitalize on F3 Gold's exploratory findings would not be an open-pit-style mine, F3 officials said, but would rather be a deep underground mine.
 F3 Gold’s exploratory drilling program would be at least the second Black Hills exploratory gold-drilling operation in recent years. A Canadian company, Mineral Mountain Resources, currently has its operation on hold after a recent initial phase of nine drilled-and-plugged holes near Rochford.
 Gold exploration and mining have been ongoing in the Black Hills since the 1870s. The only currently active, large-scale gold mine in the Black Hills is the Wharf Mine, which is near Terry Peak.

The allegations helped fuel the #MeToo movement, in which women have gone public with misconduct allegations against powerful men in business, entertainment and politics.
 “This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement,” Justice James Burke told the potential jurors on Thursday. “You must decide this case on the evidence.”
 Prosecutors, Weinstein’s lawyers and Burke are striving to select 12 jurors and six alternates before opening statements, which are expected to begin on Jan. 22.
 Jurors, all of whom had already passed a round of pre-screening and submitted written questionnaires, were questioned in groups of 20 by the lawyers in the case.
 Prosecutors asked whether jurors would be able to convict Weinstein on the basis of witness testimony, without other evidence.
 Defense lawyer Damon Cheronis asked one group whether they would consider the cross-examination of a woman who said she was assaulted as “victim-shaming,” and whether they thought it was possible that a woman might “reframe” a consensual sexual encounter as an assault years later.
 Most of the questioning drew only nods in response from the potential jurors. After questioning, each side was given an opportunity to strike jurors from the pool.
 At one point, while jurors were out of the room, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi accused Weinstein’s lawyers of systematically striking “every white female” from the pool.
 Donna Rotunno, one of Weinstein’s lawyers, did not dispute striking the white women, but said there were reasons for each.
 “We are here to try to pick a fair jury,” she said. “This is not some conspiracy against the state.”
 Burke rejected Illuzzi’s argument and allowed all the strikes to stand.
 The seven chosen jurors include a woman who works at a sports venue, a woman who works as a security guard and a man who works in banking.
 Weinstein’s trial began on January 6 and is expected to last up to two months.
 Weinstein, once one of Hollywood’s most powerful producers, made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as _The English Patient_ and _Shakespeare in Love_.
 On Wednesday, Weinstein filed a last-minute motion with a New York appellate court to have his trial delayed and moved out of Manhattan, arguing that the “carnival-like atmosphere” surrounding the case made it impossible for him to get a fair trial.
 The court denied the request for a delay and will rule on the request to move the trial by next week, according to Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein’s lawyers.

NEW YORK (AP) — The Recording Academy has placed Deborah Dugan, its president and CEO of just six months, on administrative leave following an allegation of unspecified misconduct by a senior leader. The move announced late Thursday comes 10 days before the 2020 Grammy Awards will be held in Los Angeles. \"In light of concerns raised to the Recording Academy Board of Trustees, including a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team, the board has placed Recording Academy President and CEO Deborah Dugan on administrative leave, effective immediately,” the academy said in a statement to The Associated Press on Thursday. “The board has also retained two independent third-party investigators to conduct independent investigations of the allegations.” Dugan, the former CEO of Bono’s (RED) organization, became the first woman appointed to lead the academy. Recording Academy Board Chair Harvey Mason Jr., the music producer who has worked with Chris Brown, Jennifer Hudson and more, will serve as interim president and CEO of the academy. “The board determined this action to be necessary in order to restore the confidence of the Recording Academy’s membership, repair Recording Academy employee morale, and allow the Recording Academy to focus on its mission of serving all music creators,” the statement continued. “The Recording Academy Board of Trustees is committed to fostering a safe, diverse, and inclusive workplace, music industry, and society.” Dugan succeeded Neil Portnow, who led the Grammys since 2002. Before joining (RED), the AIDS organization that launched in 2006, Dugan was president of Disney Publishing Worldwide and executive vice president at EMI/Capitol Records. She started her career as an attorney...

SALEM, Va. (WDBJ7) - Sally Southard is like most diabetics describing the disease. “It’s 24/7. No vacations,” Southard said. “You know It’s always there. You’re always thinking about it.”But that's now changed."I don't think about diabetes as much as I used to because of this. I totally trust it," Southard said, pointing to the small device she's holding in her hand.She's talking about the artificial pancreas, powered by an algorithm developed at the University of Virginia Medical Center, that tracks her blood sugar and regulates the amount of insulin it's pumping into her blood stream.It's called Control IQ, and when news came that the Food and Drug Administration approved it in December, "Everybody was like, 'woo hoo, yeah, finally!'" Southard said.Southard knows exactly how it works. You see, she has taken part in many clinical trials over the past several years."Eight clinical trials at UVA," Southard said. "Each time I was in a trial things would get better. You make improvements."“Here is the cartridge that you put the insulin in,” Southard explained as she demonstrated how it works.She's now happy to share with everyone the particulars of the device that's smaller than a cell phone, and how it works in tandem with her continuous glucose monitor to keep her blood sugar in check.The device checks her blood sugar every five minutes. "[If my] blood sugars are going up, let me give her more insulin, or blood sugars are going down, it stops giving me insulin," Southard said." "So it's like the pancreas here."The only thing she must do is enter how many carbohydrates she's eating. The device has a sleep mode and an exercise mode."And it's managing my blood sugar much better as a machine than I did for 50 years," Southard said.Ultimately, blood sugars are kept more consistent in what's considered a good range, and that means fewer complications. "I definitely feel better and I'm sleeping better," Southard said.The software is available through the Tandem Corporation. The company will send emails to people who have the Tandem insulin pumps. Each person will have to watch an educational video on Control IQ, and then they will receive a code to download the Control IQ software onto their device."It's easy," Southard said. "It's definitely changed my life."Copyright 2020 WDBJ7. All rights reserved.

The one weakness on the 49ers defense of late has been cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon, who has been picked on repeatedly as teams avoid Richard Sherman. Witherspoon has allowed all five TD passes given up by San Francisco the past three games and was benched for Emmanuel Moseley in the first quarter last week after getting beaten for a 41-yard TD by Stefon Diggs. Shanahan hasn’t said what his plan is for this week, but it seems likely Moseley will get the nod after faring well in nine games as a starter earlier this season when Witherspoon was hurt.

The Senate impeachment trial on whether to remove US President Donald Trump from office formally began on Thursday even as a congressional watchdog found that the White House broke the law by withholding security aid for Ukraine approved by Congress.The assessment from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) was a setback for Trump, but it was unclear if it would figure in his trial in the Republican-led Senate given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered.Democrat Adam Schiff, who heads a team of seven House of Representatives members who will serve as prosecutors, appeared on the Senate floor to read the two charges passed by the House on December 18 that accused Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his dealings with Ukraine.US Chief Justice John Roberts, wearing his black judicial robe, took an oath to preside over the trial and then swore in the assembled senators who will serve as jurors, asking if they would do impartial justice.The 99 senators present signed their assent one by one. One senator - Republican Jim Inhofe - was in his home state of Oklahoma to be with a family member facing a medical issue, according to his office, but was due to sign next week.The Senate is expected to acquit Trump, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two- thirds majority. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.Opening statements were due to start on Tuesday.The abuse of power cited in the House articles of impeachment included Trumps withholding of $391 million in security aid for Ukraine, a move Democrats have said was aimed at pressuring Kiev into investigating political rival Joe Biden, the presidents possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election.Congress had approved the funds to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists. The money was ultimately provided in September after the controversy spilled into public view.The GAO said the U.S. Constitution does not grant a president authority to unilaterally withhold funds, as Trump did. Instead, a president can only withhold spending in limited circumstances spelled out by law, its report said.Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law, the GAO said on Thursday.The GAOs findings are not legally binding, but its reports are seen by lawmakers as objective, reliable and generally uncontested. It has no prosecutorial power.Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who sought the GAO investigation, said the findings undercut Republican arguments that there was nothing wrong with Trumps action.We now have a clear, lucid finding that the Trump administration violated the law and we know that the president ordered the administration to commit an illegal act, he told Reuters.Republican Senator John Cornyn said that while there may have been a civil violation of the law, it was not a criminal matter and certainly not an impeachable act.The Constitution says you impeach presidents for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. And its none of those things, said Cornyn, a former judge.Monitoring an ambassador?It is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history and no president has been removed as a direct result of the process. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the full House could vote to impeach him. The House impeached Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not convict them.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the GAO report bolstered Democrats argument that the Senate trial should include new evidence and hear from witnesses.Schiff indicated that the House prosecutors may call Lev Parnas, an associate of Trumps personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, if the Senate permits testimony in the trial.Documents released this week indicated Parnas, a Ukraine-born U.S. citizen, helped Giuliani investigate Biden and his son Hunter, and was also involved in monitoring the movements of former US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before Trump removed her in May.In an interview with Reuters, Giuliani said he pushed Trump to fire Yovanovitch but did not know if Parnas put her under surveillance.Giuliani said he was disappointed with Parnas decision to cooperate with impeachment investigators.I considered him a friend and I considered him to be a man who had character and now I consider him to be a man who will say whatever his phony lawyer wants him to say, Giuliani said.Parnas told MSNBC on Wednesday that Trump knew exactly what was going on, and his lawyer has released several photos of Parnas with the president.Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump repeated his assertion that he did not know Parnas. He called the whole thing a big hoax.

"People appreciate the fact that it being dry improves the value of life here, but it doesn't mean that they don't like alcohol," said the bearded young entrepreneur -- himself a fan of craft beers.
 "It just means that it's something that we can hold on to as a claim to fame." So when a local business owner in 2012 gathered enough signatures to hold a referendum on whether customers could bring their own bottle of beer or wine into restaurants, some, like Drew Fasy, saw it as a threat to the city's image.
 "If you have a successful brand, you don't mess with it. Nobody is gonna change McDonald's golden arches," said the former real estate agent. He is adamant about not letting Ocean City go the way of other Jersey shore towns, which are "built around alcohol," in his opinion.
 \- 'Gray area' - The 2012 BYOB ("bring your own bottle") referendum sharply divided the city. Opponents were accused of being religious zealots. Supporters of seeking to open the flood gates to debauchery.
 Chris and Sharon Hoffmann, owners of the Captain Bob's restaurant, said they have been boycotted for calling for a little more flexibility when it comes to alcohol.
 "It was a little nervewracking," recalled Sharon Hoffman. "People who would make reservations but not show up. We had people who smashed our flower pots, someone who sliced my tire. It was heated." As it turned out, the "no" to BYOB won a comfortable two-thirds majority, but the couple has since found a way to work around local alcohol laws by privatizing their restaurant.
 Patrons pay $10 per year to join the "Foodies Dinner Club" and are then able to bring their own bottle, as if they were going over to a friend's house to eat.
 Approved by local authorities, the concept is catching on in the island -- where high-end restaurants are almost nonexistent due to the fact owners are unable to offer alcoholic beverages with meals.
 "Why should I have to leave the island to get a good dinner?" lamented Chris Hoffmann.
 That said neither he nor his wife would dream of pushing for alcohol to be legalized throughout the city.
 "You have to respect the culture," he said.
