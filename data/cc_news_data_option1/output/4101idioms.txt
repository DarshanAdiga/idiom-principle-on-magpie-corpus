Malaysia will restrict movements in its biggest city, Kuala Lumpur, neighbouring Selangor state and the administrative capital of Putrajaya starting Wednesday to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Defence Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob says all schools in these areas will be shut and all religious, sports and social activities will be halted for two weeks. He says economic activities can continue but with strict health measures. The move comes just over four months after Malaysia lifted a three-month nationwide lockdown to control the pandemic. It has experienced a new wave of cases following increased travel for an election last month in eastern Sabah state, a hotspot on Borneo island. Several politicians, including a Cabinet minister, tested positive for the virus after returning from Sabah. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had to isolate himself for two weeks after coming into contact with the minister. The government earlier announced that Sabah will be placed under a restricted movement order from Tuesday. Ismail said inter- district travel is banned under the partial lockdown, except with approval. Other restrictions include a limit of two people leaving each household to purchase groceries. Malaysia has reported more than 16,000 cases with 157 deaths.

9\. You won't pay taxes on the money no matter when it arrives
 The IRS doesn't consider stimulus money to be income, and a payment you get this year won't reduce your refund in 2021 or increase the amount you owe when you file your 2020 tax return. You also won't have to repay part of your check if you qualify for a lower amount in 2021. The IRS said if you didn't receive everything you were owed this year, you can claim it as a credit on your 2020 federal income tax return by filing in 2021. Here's everything to know about stimulus checks and taxes.
 There's much more to know about other government payments during the pandemic, including a possible interest check from the IRS and where the $300 federal unemployment benefit is now.

Netflix's latest horror series _The Haunting of Bly Manor _only landed on the streamer last week, but it's already got people talking on Twitter - and not just because it is spine-chillingly terrifying. Fans of the anthology series have been discussing the show on Twitter saying that as scary as it is, at its core _The Haunting of Bly Manor_ is a love story. Spoilers below.
 The series is inspired by the ghost stories of Henry James, including the 1898 horror novella _The Turn of the Screw_ , and it follows the story of a tutor who is looking after two children, Flora and Miles, at stately mansion Bly Manor. Before long, she starts to see strangers around the property and the grounds, and that's where things all start to unravel.
 Alongside the terrifying horror, the series also focuses on the love story between au pair Dani (Pedretti) and house gardener Jamie - a storyline that many fans were more invested in than other aspects of the show.
 The relationship starts off with a definite slow burn. Jamie is fairly standoffish when Dani first comes to the house, but they begin getting close after the scene where Dani surprises Jamie by holding her hand. After this moment, it becomes clear that they like each other and the relationship begins to flourish, making people on Twitter _very_ happy, and prompting fans to call the series a love story.

"Let me ask you a question," Atlanta midfielder Jeff Larentoqicz said. "The referee said, 'yes he's offside.' He moved his body to get out of the way of the ball. As the ball is traveling toward the goal, does Brad know (Royer) is offside? Probably not. What happens if Royer doesn't move his body? Does the ball hit him? The ref said he doesn't make a play on the ball. In that moment, can Brad know that he's offside and say, 'oh well I have to save the original shot and Royer is offside?' Ref said he's offside. I think Jair [Marrufo] is one of the best ref's in the league. I think Alan Kelly is probably the best ref in the league and he was the VAR. But I think they get it wrong."

On the grand scale, politics are the process by which laws are created, enforced, and torn down. It’s not just the campaign circus that comes to town every four years; it’s the air we breathe during wildfire season, the class accomodations your Muslim friends can request when they’re fasting for Ramadan, the safety of your roommate taking the Burke-Gilman trail home, the unemployment checks your sibling got when they were laid off, and so, so much more. So how can you stay “neutral”?
 I never thought I’d say this, but I’d rather talk to a Trump supporter than a self-described “apolitical” person, because at least I can ascertain their values, their hopes for the future, and their rationale. Maybe it’s racism, maybe it’s tax law, and maybe it’s Maybelline, but at least there’s a reason or a conviction.
 I would also seriously rather hear Jeff Bezos’ take on foreign policy, because at least I know it’s guided by greed and corporate domination. Apathetic Amy, on the other hand? She just doesn’t care, and that sort of self-destructive behavior should be reserved for your high school ex-boyfriend and him only.
 So, yes, I do try to prod people into giving the tiniest of s---s about the measures by which we hold ourselves accountable to our planet, the ways in which we protect each other, and the means by which we commit ourselves to a more equitable, sustainable future for all.
 But at the end of the day, some people choose to stay constipated, and I can’t be around those individuals. I can’t grab coffee with someone and multi-task between hearing about their classes and grappling with their unwillingness to engage with the systems that affect my rights and daily life. I can’t date someone who thinks, “I don’t care who lives or dies, because I know I can survive.” I can’t support someone who genuinely believes that neutrality is an option when lives and liberties are both at stake.
 Why? Because it’s not that hard to just give a s---.

By Caroline Framke
 LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Nicole Kidman is unparalleled in the art of playing a woman who's equal parts flinty determination and distraught pain. When her face falls in shock, her character is likely to fight the instinct to fall apart, instead steeling herself for whatever's yet to come.
 It's a balancing act that found a particularly remarkable showing on TV in David E. Kelley's "Big Little Lies," where Kidman played a woman on the edge of shattering within her abusive marriage.
 In "The Undoing," Kelley once again enlists Kidman to play a wife overwhelmed by her husband's potential for perfidy, a role she once again owns with an irresistible force. But not even Kidman's performance, nor sharp turns from the likes of Hugh Grant and Donald Sutherland, can quite center its diffuse interests.
 The new HBO limited series is, to no one's surprise, ably acted and handsomely made. Director Susanne Bier ("The Night Manager") shoots the chilly New York winter in which the show's catastrophic events unfold with an eye for the unsettling.
 Characters steal glances through cracked doors and lonely street corners. Bier's camera spies on their gorgeous homes, dripping with more money than most New Yorkers could ever see in ten lifetimes, from impossibly high angles, making them feel ever more cavernous and all-consuming.
 When Kidman's character Grace gets overwhelmed, we see flashes of the horrors running through her head -- and it's just about impossible to tell if we're looking at the past or some imagined version thereof. In these unsettling moments, when Grace acts as an unreliable narrator in the increasingly bizarre story of her own life, "The Undoing" is extremely effective as a psychological thriller. Where it gets lost, then, is in chasing the scattered interests of its ever-twisting plot.
 Grace's world turns upside-down the day after a young New York City mother is gruesomely murdered the night after her glitzy private school benefit. (Yet another "Big Little Lies" parallel.) The media, salivating over the details of a crime implicating the city's most elite social strata, can't get enough coverage of the aftermath and ensuing court case, i.e. the stuff that tabloid dreams are made of. Pundits debate the hazy facts of the case, pointing out that the victim, Elena Alves (Matilda De Angelis), was unlike the other manicured mothers at the elite Reardon School, being Latina and poorer.
 When turning to the prime suspect (Grant), they make sure to highlight that he's not just a charming children's oncologist, but a white and obscenely wealthy man. (Grant, playing more or less against type, is perfect casting as a man most can't help but love, even when given proof that they really shouldn't.)
 That his father-in-law (Sutherland) has the kind of old New York City money that practically grants him his own zip code can't hurt, either. And when push comes to shove, the skeptical reports continue, who's the jury going to believe: dead Elena and her taciturn husband Fernando (Ismael Cruz Cordova) of Harlem, or upstanding citizens Jonathan and his statuesque therapist wife (Kidman) who's modeled her entire life on being as helpful and presentable as possible?
 These are useful, interesting questions about an all too real dynamic that lies at the heart of a growing class divide. So it's frustrating to realize that "The Undoing" raises these issues almost as a courtesy before almost entirely glossing over them.
 As with "Big Little Lies," Kelley's scripts show just enough awareness of those people who don't plan fundraisers from their lavish mansions to acknowledge them, but not enough to shed any real insight. More disappointing still, Elena spends most of her time onscreen as a mysterious object of lust -- or else horribly murdered, her face bashed in beyond recognition on the floor of her studio. It's a terrible combination of stereotypes relegated to Latina characters too often, and Kelley doesn't come close to subverting them in this iteration.
 "The Undoing" comes so close to commenting on privilege and injustice with something like awareness, but all too quickly devolves into the very stereotypes it purports to understand.
 After watching five of the series' six episodes, I even found myself thinking that "The Undoing" might actually be more successful if it had eschewed addressing race and class entirely. Sure, it would be another kind of ridiculous to have a show entirely about the rich eating their own. But as something like "Succession" has shown, it's more than possible to do so while making plain just how wildly privileged the characters are while avoiding tired cliches of the disenfranchised.
 In fact, there are moments when "The Undoing" does exactly that to very smart effect. Grace is rarely more unnerved than when faced with Detective Mendoza (Edgar Ramirez), who's entirely unimpressed with her entire world and has no trouble cutting through its vague placations to get to an actual point. And as Jonathan's ruthless lawyer, Noma Dumezweni turns in the show's most piercing performance; even the slightest raise of her skeptical eyebrows is enough to rattle Jonathan and Grace in a way that neither has felt in perhaps their entire lives.
 That "The Undoing" falls apart under scrutiny probably won't matter all that much. Plenty of viewers will undoubtedly be thrilled to tune in to a glossy HBO drama starring two of the world's most telegenic people in a story tailor made for true crime podcasts. It's just a shame that it couldn't resist those cliches to become something much more powerful than just another case of the week.
 "The Undoing" premieres Sunday, October 25 at 9 pm on HBO.

 ROME, Oct 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Global goals to tackle climate change and end hunger by 2030 are within reach if donors and developing nations help small farmers grow more climate resilient crops, access irrigation and tap into social safety nets, researchers said Monday.
 In a new report, they identified 10 key shifts that could lift nearly 500 million people out of hunger, double the incomes of 545 million small farmers in low and middle income countries, and limit agricultural emissions.
 The changes would cost an extra $33 billion a year, said researchers from Ceres2030, a partnership between Cornell University, the International Food Policy Research Institute, and the International Institute for Sustainable Development.
 Of that money, $14 billion would need to come from donors, who already supply $12 billion to tackle hunger, with $19 billion provided by developing countries, researchers said.
 That is "a relatively modest amount of money" compared to what countries are spending to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and would offer "potentially massive gains", said Carin Smaller, co-director of Ceres2030.
 In 2019, almost 690 million people, or just under 9% of the world's population, went to bed hungry, figures from the United Nations show. But Smaller said the pandemic could cause the number to rise by another 95 million this year.
 Meanwhile, food production accounts for about a quarter of climate changing emissions, according to a 2018 report in the journal Science, and rising food production is a major driver of deforestation and increased consumption of fossil fuels.
 Targeting additional funding to on-farm improvements, getting harvests effectively to market and making sure farmers have access to basic social safety nets could help rein in both problems, said the Ceres2030 report.
 "If you target investments on the farm, you improve the economic productivity of these poor farmers. If you target investments on the move, which is basically markets, you ensure they have a place to sell their goods," Small said.
 Social protection programmes would ensure farmers have a minimum level of capital to adopt new, green technologies and environmentally-friendly practices, improving productivity without harming nature, she said.
 Among the report's 10 recommendations is investing in agricultural extension services which offer training and advice to farmers - and particularly ensuring they reach women - to encourage adoption of climate resilient crops.
 Helping poor farmers become part of farmers' organisations is also crucial, with studies in Africa showing this improves crop yields and quality, as well as water quality and soil conditions, the report said.
 Last week, the U.N. World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its efforts to combat hunger around the world and improve conditions for peace in areas affected by conflict.
 "It's fantastic they won the prize. I hope it will help us also make sure we don't forget the longer-term investments that are needed to end hunger once and for all," Smaller told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

When Apple jumps into the 5G market, it's expected to immediately be a huge player. This year, Apple likely will ship 50 million 5G iPhones, according to Strategy Analytics, which would make it the second biggest 5G vendor in 2020 -- and that would be in less than three months of sales. By comparison, Samsung shipped more than 6.7 million Galaxy 5G smartphones last year, after its first 5G phones hit the market in May.
 Next year, Apple is expected to be the world's biggest 5G phone vendor, Strategy Analytics said.
 ##  A different iPhone launch
 Apple holding its event over the internet isn't the only thing that sets its iPhone announcement apart from those of previous years. The device is also arriving later in the year than it typically does, with analysts expecting either a late October or early November launch for Apple's newest handsets. That's about a month later than typical iPhone launches, something Apple warned about in July when it acknowledged the new smartphones would arrive "a few weeks" later than normal.
 Apple's announcements will also overlap with Amazon's rescheduled Prime Day shopping event, scheduled for Oct. 13 and 14. Typically, that entirely made-up holiday taken place in July, but this year it was pushed back due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Apple still held its annual September event, though, using it to announce new iPads, a new Apple Watch and its new Apple One subscription service. The service combines its $5-a-month Apple TV Plus, $10-a-month Apple Music, $10-a-month Apple News Plus and $5-a-month Apple Arcade gaming efforts.

The 24-Hour Crisis Line connects you immediately to a trained professional. They can help you determine if longer-term care is required, and how to handle the situation as it is occurring. You can call this hotline whether you are the person in crisis or if you are a friend or family member of the person in crisis.
 King County 2-1-1 is not a mental health-specific hotline; they cover all health-related concerns in King County. However, they do provide some mental health services.
 Teen Link is staffed by trained teenagers. If someone wants to talk about what they are going through but doesn’t feel comfortable talking to an adult, they can call Teen Link to talk to someone their own age. Teen Link also now has a texting service.
 WA Recovery Helpline provides crisis intervention and helps find resources for continued care after a crisis incident. This helpline specializes in drug and alcohol issues but can be used for all mental health crises.

Inoltre, il rischio di un contagio da contatto di superfici contaminate dipende da vari altri fattori, di cui si deve tenere conto, come la quantità di virus, le caratteristiche del materiale (è più basso nel caso di una superficie porosa o ruvida) e le condizioni esterne dell’ambiente.

Malaysia will restrict movements in its biggest city, Kuala Lumpur, neighboring Selangor state and the administrative capital of Putrajaya starting Wednesday to curb a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob says all schools in these areas will be shut and all religious, sports and social activities will be halted for two weeks. He says economic activities can continue but with strict health measures. The move comes just over four months after Malaysia lifted a three-month nationwide lockdown to control the pandemic. It has experienced a new wave of cases following increased travel for an election last month in eastern Sabah state, a hotspot on Borneo island. Several politicians, including a Cabinet minister, tested positive for the virus after returning from Sabah. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had to isolate himself for two weeks after coming into contact with the minister. The government earlier announced that Sabah will be placed under a restricted movement order from Tuesday. Ismail said inter- district travel is banned under the partial lockdown, except with approval. Other restrictions include a limit of two people leaving each household to purchase groceries. Malaysia has reported more than 16,000 cases with 157 deaths.

The county stands ready to fulfill its commitment on funding tennis through the $1.7 million approved by voters in the sales tax referendum, Cohilas said. The county should discuss the expansion with the University System of Georgia and other potential partners to leverage the available cash.
 The sales tax dollars are not sufficient in themselves to build a facility from scratch, but could be used to expand an existing one, he said. The national and state tennis associations also can provide assistance, particularly with design, Sadler said.
 The city’s responsibility in the effort is in providing a tennis director, Cohilas said. During the discussion, commissioners expressed support for Cohilas’ assessment.
 “Your board backs you 100 percent,” Commissioner Clinton Johnson told Cohilas.
 Johnson recommended that the county’s Recreation Committee be involved in further discussion on tennis expansion. Cohilas agreed and suggested a community collaborative also be involved.
 Later in the meeting Cohilas addressed other city-county issues, and said that the county has been instrumental in the development of downtown -- from the courthouse facility to two parking decks, the Flint River Resource Center and its development of a trail connecting Radium Springs with the city that will include a stretch from Albany State to downtown. It also provided assistance for the relocation of the Albany Museum of Art to downtown.
 The trail will provide Albany State students “for the first time, the ability to walk downtown without having to cross Oglethorpe (Boulevard),” Cohilas said. “I think we see every school year a student being hit crossing Oglethorpe.”
 Commissioner Victor Edwards suggested that the county communicate better its contributions inside the city limits, including funding for parks and other facilities used by all residents.
 Another suggestion from Commissioner Anthony Jones was for city and county board members to meet in order to make sure they are on the same page and working on a shared vision.
 “I think it’s important to let people know how the county and city have worked together and what happens when we don’t work together,” Cohilas said. “It’s confusing, because so many people think the county is only the unincorporated area, when in reality the county has spent millions and millions of dollars in the downtown area.”

On a personal level, what this means to me is hope.
 I have worked with many youth that are still in high school resource classes who have talked about going to college after graduation. We always encourage individuals with these goals to pursue them, but often they get lost in the system and end up in an adult high school until they reach the age of 21.
 The purpose of the grant that is being offered is to “establish a network of centers across the state called the Utah Higher Education Inclusion Alliance that will provide options for individuals with intellectual disabilities to pursue postsecondary education. The alliance will use a portion of the grant to establish a similar program at USU’s Eastern Campus in Price Utah.”
 I look forward to observing the progress and growth of this program in the coming months. I am excited for the individuals who will be able to pilot this program at UVU and the opportunities that they will have in their lives.
 I, again, thank everyone at the Melisa Nellesen Center for Autism and Utah Valley University for their role in making this a reality.

There really is no way to quantify exactly how much the lack of spring football and limited preseason impacted the season. But it is clear the virus has hurt defense. Look at the 11 games featuring top-25 teams this weekend. Twelve teams scored in the 40s and three in the 50s. Alabama and Ole Miss combined for 1,370 yards of offense in the Crimson Tide’s 63-48 victory. Virginia Tech put up 45 points and still lost — by double figures at North Carolina. Maybe this changes once the Big Ten and Pac-12 begin. More likely, it doesn’t. Scoring is up across the board and it is trending into an absurd category. Just another example of how different this season will be.

 # Nina Gilfert: Fall in Pennsylvania
 Daily Commercial
 This time of year I get a little homesick. I miss the change of seasons. When I was a little girl in Pennsylvania, September was a time for preparing – preparing for school, preparing for winter, preparing for all the holidays.
 The street I could see outside my bedroom window was lined with maple trees. In the fall the leaves turned from gold to red and then piled up along the gutters and sidewalks. We used to jump in them and cover ourselves up.
 September meant school started and we would put on our new school clothes and trudge up the hill. Our elementary school consisted of four buildings. The oldest one was two stories and had four classrooms. Later a first grade building and a second grade building were added and then a double classroom building was added for third and fourth grade. Each classroom had a coal burning stove that sat in the corner with a coal shuttle nearby that, in cold weather the teacher would conscript the biggest boys in the class to keep it filled from a coal shed on the grounds.
 Our playground was a couple of acres of dirt, which didn't bother us at all. At recess and before school started you could hear the bat crack against the ball where the boys played baseball and the sound of the jumping rope hitting the concrete walkway in front of the building. We played hard on that old dirt playground, with little or no supervision. There was plenty of room also for a good rough game of crack-the-whip.
 The fun was over and the lessons began when Effie Watt, the school principal, pulled the rope that rang the bell at the top of the two-story building. I will never forget Miss Watt. We learned discipline from her. In spite of her small stature, she and her paddle struck fear into the hearts of any child who broke the rules.
 I only remember one time that she used it, but no one ever forgot that it was there, hanging on a hook just inside her classroom.
 October, when the trees were finally bare of leaves, we looked forward to Halloween, which we celebrated not for just one night but for a whole week. I don't know why our neighbors tolerated us but they did. We would dress up in old clothes and a mask and knock on their doors. Sometimes we were offered candy and sometimes hot chocolate and cookies but we were never turned away.
 The first snowflakes of November were exciting for kids but brought groans from grownups because it meant shoveling sidewalks and driveways and driving on slippery roads. When you live in hill country slippery roads were twice the problem. Of course that also meant some of our school teachers would be unable to drive to school, so we got a holiday.
 They never gave us a holiday because we couldn't navigate the roads and sidewalks covered with ice and snow, but because the teachers couldn't get up the hill in their cars. I can actually remember crawling on my hands and knees because of the ice; even rubber boots held no traction if the hill was steep enough.
 A number of years ago I went home to Apollo to attend my sister Frances' funeral. I stayed at the family complex of my nephew and his wife on top of a hill. We all attended the viewing on Friday evening, where we saw all her children and grandchildren. It was snowing lightly when we left the funeral home but the next morning I looked out the window onto a world of white. The lane down to town and our cars were buried in 2 feet of fresh snow.
 It was beautiful but treacherous. My son Tom and his wife, Linda, had driven up from Tennessee the night before and stayed in town. In the morning we found they had hiked through the snow to have breakfast with us. The road crews had been working all night to clear the main highways but hadn't reached any secondary roads, like the one leading from the church to the family complex on top of the hill.
 My nephew kept calling, hoping that we would be able to make it down the road to the funeral, which was not even a mile away, but the snow kept on falling and the road was still 2 feet deep in the white stuff.
 That's Pennsylvania!. Why do I love it? I guess because it's home.

Merkel urges young people to do their bit to beat the pandemic
 Most experts agree that travelers returning from holidays in the summer months were responsible for a significant rise in infections. But now they mainly blame social gatherings without masks or social distancing for the latest rapid increase.
 So most states have implemented restrictions on the number of people who can meet in public. Berlin has ordered bars and restaurants to close by 11 o'clock in the evening. Violation of the ban can carry a fine of up to 5000€ ($5900.) Bavaria has introduced a 250€ fine for anybody who refuses to wear a mask as stipulated.
 The 16 state premiers are to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday in a fresh attempt to streamline the measures.
 Virologist Christian Drosten, who has become a household name in recent months, has warned: "The virus will spread more and more; and we will increasingly find ourselves in a situation where we have to adopt uniform measures." For the time being though, such a streamlined approach seems a long way off in Germany, where federal structures are hampering a unified approach.

"Yeah, I mean it's frustrating," Earthquakes midfielder Shea Salinas said. "Honestly, they started the first half really well, and probably could've scored in the first five minutes of the game.

It puts you behind the eight ball, but I think we still tried to control the game, tried to stick with our game plan, and we had several chances there in the second half.

In this case, because the alleged crimes occurred within the confines of Vatican City, the city state’s criminal prosecutors also have jurisdiction and decided to charge the two priests and bring the case to trial.
 The first hearing Thursday is expected to be largely technical in nature. The Vatican is allowing a small pool of two reporters to attend, limiting the number because of COVID-19 restrictions.
 The diocese of Como, which ordained Martinelli a priest after initially clearing him of the allegations, now insists that it restricted his ministry after “new elements” emerged in 2017. The diocese says it was committed to finding the truth “even recognizing possible delays or omissions committed in the past."
 A series of bishops, including Cardinal Angelo Comastri, the archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, said they investigated the allegations, but no one ever interviewed Jarzembowski’s roommate.
 The case is emblematic of the inherent conflicts of interest in the canon law system and the church's refusal to require abuse be reported to impartial police. Bishops are tasked with investigating allegations of abuse, but they also invest time and money for training the accused priests and need them to fill Mass schedules and perform pastoral work.

Young people registered, organized and voted in massive numbers in 2008 when Obama was first on the ballot. 66% of young Americans voted for Barack Obama making the gap between voters under 30 and over 30 larger than in any presidential election since 1972 (the first election with exit polling data). And ever since, both parties have recognized the importance of the youth vote.
 The people choose who represents us at every level of government. It’s our job, on the ballot and in between elections, to make it clear how we feel about our representation. We should absolutely be marching in the streets and donating to causes — but these issues are also on the ballot. Go to any candidate’s website, whether President of Attorney General or State Representative, and you’ll see their stance on the issues that matter. This election cycle (and 2020 in general) has been defined by a public health crisis, an economic and jobs crisis, the climate crisis, a racial divide and a gun violence epidemic.

 We are in the middle of a moment. We decide what happens next.
 Due to the pandemic, we’ve been given so many different ways to vote. If you like the traditional in-person Election Day, Nov. 3 is right around the corner. If Nov. 3 doesn’t work for you, Philadelphia has started Early Voting Centers and you can go at your convenience. If you’d rather vote from home, you can request a mail-in ballot until Oct. 27. If you are unsure of voting by mail, you can drop it in a ballot-drop box.

Coach Tom Herman is closer to being in hot water than supposedly having the Longhorns back. I obviously don’t blame the programs or even the fans. It’s not really the media’s fault either. I see it as Clemson-Alabama fatigue. We want fresh faces in the College Football Playoff. We get tired of Nick Saban and Swinney on the podium every year. After Florida’s impressive 2-0 start, there were already some calling the Gators this year’s LSU, an absurdly early comparison that really had no legs. LSU offered us a respite with its out-of- nowhere run to a title last year. But Florida’s defense can’t compare to LSU’s of a year ago, and that was clearly evident on Saturday when it couldn’t stop a nosebleed at Texas A&M in a return-to-reality 41-38 road loss.
