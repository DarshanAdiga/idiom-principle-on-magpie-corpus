The virus upended Trump’s plan to run on the back of a strong economy, and Biden has charged that the president has pushed to reopen states too soon in hopes of jump-starting the markets and lifting his standing in the polls. But several states have had to slow down the pace of their reopening, and officials are warily watching a rise in coronavirus cases in the Midwest, including Ohio.

The strong start has continued for the new Pictona at Holly Hill pickleball complex that officially opened on July 15. As of the end of the month, the club was already up to more than 450 members, more than double the original goal of founders Rainier and Julie Martens.
   
 One of the club's members is Kate McCallum, whose late father, Barney McCallum, was one of the three men who invented the sport of pickleball in the Seattle, Washington, area in 1965.
   
 "I wish Dad could've seen this," said Kate McCallum in a phone interview referring to the $6.2 million 24-court Pictona complex.
   
 The momentum continues to build for Pictona. On Monday, AdventHealth Daytona Beach CEO Ed Noseworthy presented the nonprofit Pictona at Holly Hill Club that runs the complex with a $100,000 donation. The hospital is now sponsor of the complex's covered pickleball court area. The check was accepted on behalf of the club by Rainer and Julie Martens, the visionaries and principal financial backers of the Pictona complex.
   
 "When Rainer and Julie stopped by our office many months ago, they had this vision, this incredible vision (to create Pictona)," said Noseworthy. "They have not only the heart for this sport, but they also have the heart for this community and wanting the community to be healthy, wanting the community to have well being, and wanting the community to have a place to come to.
   
 "It was a no-brainer for us to be a part of it because when you think about the mission of what they're trying to do, it lines up with our (AdventHealth's) mission."
   
 Kate McCallum lives part of the year in Ormond Beach and part of the year in the Seattle area. She was one of the "original" pickleball players. She was 11 when her Dad teamed up with the late Congressman Joel Pritchard and businessman Bill Bell to invent the game.
   
 In a 2009 video interview that can be seen on the website for the USA Pickleball Association, the late Barney McCallum recalled how the game was invented "by accident."
   
 "It was a rainy (summer) day. The kids (of the respective families) were bored ... (and were) getting on everyone's nerves. So Joel picked up a ping-pong paddle which happened to be in his (Bainbridge Island) cabin and saw a (Cosom) Fun Ball (similar to a Wiffle Ball) and said, 'Hey, you kids, get out of here and go up to the badminton court (in the Pritchards' backyard) and hit this ball around."
   
 After an hour had elapsed, Pritchard and the other parents were surprised that the kids still hadn't returned to the house. When he and another parent decided to investigate they found the kids "totally involved in hitting that ball around."
   
 The following weekend, Barney McCallum got involved by helping Pritchard and Bell come up with rules for the new game.
   
 Noting how the kids kept breaking the ping-pong paddles, Barney McCallum decided to make slightly larger, stronger paddles out of plywood on the band saw in the basement of his family's Bainbridge Island home, just up the street from the Pritchards.
   
 That fall, after the three families went their separate ways until the next spring, Barney McCallum continued to tinker with refining the game's rules.
   
 "The dimensions (for pickleball) were dictated by the limitations of the Pritchards' court," he recalled, noting that a madrona tree was located right next to one end making it difficult to make a backswing there.
   
 "We (also) fought the idea of big powerful people domineering the game," he said. "This (the rules for pickleball) put every size and shape (player) right into it."
   
 Kate McCallum recalled that she and the other kids came up with the name for the new sport.
   
 "The Pritchards' dog Pickles used to run across the court so we decided to call the game pickleball," she said.
   
 Prichard's wife Joan several years after the game was invented had a different recollection regarding the origin of the name.
   
 She said she started calling the game pickleball because "the combination of different sports reminded me of the pickle boat in crew where oarsmen were chosen from the leftovers of other boats," according to the USA Pickleball Association website.
   
 David McCallum, Kate's younger brother, recalled that the families often made up games on the fly that were quickly forgotten.
   
 To everyone's surprise, pickleball turned out to have staying power and then some.
   
 Pickleball has been the nation's fastest-growing recreational sport in recent years, with 3.3 million million players, up 9.7% over the three previous years, according to a 2019 report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.
   
 While the sport is played by all ages, it has become especially popular among those 65 and older because it is less stressful to the knees and other joints.
   
 Barney McCallum in his 2009 interview said, "When we started, there were no ambitions" to create an international sport.
   
 "The first six, seven years, it was strictly a (regional) game. Pickleball was a sideline for us," he recalled.
   
 The first "Pickle-Ball Inc." kits sold in the 1970s included photos of Kate McCallum and the other original pickleball kids on the box.
   
 Kate McCallum said when her Dad celebrated his last birthday before his death last November, he was thrilled to receive birthday cards from pickleball players from throughout the world.
   
 She added that when he visited her in Ormond Beach several years ago, they drove to The Villages to check out the pickleball courts there.
   
 "Even the new Latitude Margaritaville (55-and-older) community off LPGA (Boulevard in Daytona Beach) has pickleball courts. It's all over the world," Kate McCallum said. "It gives me a sense of pride."
   
 The Pictona at Holly Hill complex is at 1066 Ridgewood Ave. in Holly Hill. More information, including the cost to become a member can be found online at pictona.org. The complex includes a restaurant called The Kitchen, a pickleball term. The eatery is open to the general public.
   
 Pictona is set to host the USA Pickelball Association's Atlantic South Regional Tournament in October 2021. The several-day event is expected to draw 700 to 800 players from multiple states as well as a 1,000 spectators.
   
 Pictona co-founder Julie Martens said she and her husband were surprised to meet Kate McCallum several months ago.
   
 "She was anxious to join and was very proud to tell us who her Dad was," Martens said, adding that she and her husband were well aware of Barney McCallum's instrumental role in helping to invent the sport.
   
 "At first, we were wondering is this for real?," Julie Martens said of meeting Kate McCallum.
   
 Martens said McCallum not only signed up to become a member. She also made a donation to help get Pictona built.
   
 "We look forward to seeing her around (Pictona) when she returns to the area this fall," Martens said. "I think it's a validation (to Pictona to have McCallum as a member). Her joining is a tribute in a way to her father and his role in helping to invent pickleball."

The Biden campaign did not respond to messages seeking comment Thursday. Still, the former vice president enjoyed strong support among African American voters during the Democratic primary and is counting on topping Trump by wide margins with them, as well as young voters, in November. Having West, who is Black and a hip-hop icon, on the ballot could be a ploy to hurt Biden with both sets of voters.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Stefon Diggs has a new beginning with the Buffalo Bills.
 And he isn’t dwelling on his departure from the Minnesota Vikings.
 Speaking with Buffalo reporters for the first time since his blockbuster trade in March, Diggs repeatedly expressed excitement over his new surroundings while also downplaying his role in leaving Minnesota.
 “As far as my past with Minnesota, I never actually said anything,” Diggs said. “But, granted, this new situation, I can say I’m excited. There’s no right or wrong or problems to be fixed or something to replace with my old situation. I have a lot of respect for the Minnesota Vikings.”
 Last season with the Vikings, Diggs was fined more than $200,000 for unexcused absences from practices in October. He was also known for cryptic tweets that may or may not have offered insight into his situation with the team. Prior to being traded to Buffalo, Diggs tweeted “it’s time for a new beginning” — and hours later he was a member of the Bills for four draft picks.
 In Buffalo, he’s expected to be the unquestioned No. 1 receiver on a team hoping to win the AFC East following Tom Brady’s exit from the division.
 “I never really was too vocal about it. ‘It’s time for a new beginning’ was enough said,” Diggs said. “I’m super excited with my new situation. I feel like this is also a great organization built on a lot of hard-working guys, a lot of guys that really grind to get to where they’re at.
 “I trust the people that are in place. I’m just happy to be a part of it at this point. I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel or anything like that, I’m just trying to be as helpful as I can, be a puzzle piece, try to mesh as well as I can to help this team win.”
 Diggs has been a game-breaker throughout his career and the Bills are hoping he’s the finishing piece who can put them over the top. Diggs finished last season with a career-high 1,130 yards receiving and he was fourth in the league with an average of 17.9 yards per reception. He’s considered one of the best route runners in the NFL and is set to form a solid receiving trio alongside John Brown and Cole Beasley.
 Priority No. 1 for Diggs with his new team is to work on establishing chemistry with quarterback Josh Allen. The two met up for unofficial workouts in Florida earlier this summer, but have plenty of work to make up with the lack of a traditional offseason.
 “I’m super excited,” Diggs said. “He’s going into Year 3. As a quarterback, as a guy, big arm, big quarterback, a lot of heart, he runs around, he’s mobile, can extend the play. He does a lot of things extremely well. More so focused on how I can help him, anything I can do to help him. Always be in his ear, having communication with him, if he needs something from me ... I’m just there to be his supporting cast on whatever he needs and play receiver.”
 So far, so good according to teammate and standout cornerback Tre’Davious White.
 “Obviously he’s a Grade A talent,” White said. “To have a transcendent talent like that to add with the other guys that we have ... on paper, it looks great. Those guys are going to have to continue to work each and every day. Just on paper, we look sexy (on offense), we look good.”
 After expressing some concerns one month ago about playing football this year — and hours after White said that he was unsure about his own plans for this season — Diggs said that he will be playing amid coronavirus concerns.
 “Seeing that the deadline is tomorrow, I’m pretty much bought in on playing football,” Diggs said. “I’ve been here buying into the process as far as getting to know my teammates, getting to know my coaches, kind of starting to get the ball rolling. I put in a lot of time in the offseason training and (working on) my craft ... I made some arrangements where I’m going to be playing football this year.”

Lighon participated in the Winner’s Circle Showcase recently and he’s an impressive-looking prospect. All of 6-foot-3 and 230 pounds, the three-star looks like a future defensive end who can play in space. He’s thick, fast, moves well and definitely had an impressive performance at that event. Every spring there are prospects who get major offers because of how they look on the hoof, and I’d expect a lot of coaches would have taken a shot on Lighon based on appearance alone.
