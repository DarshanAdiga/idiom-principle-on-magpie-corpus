NEW YORK (AP) -- A former member of a Black radical group who was convicted in the 1971 killings of two New York City police officers has been granted parole after more than four decades behind bars. Officials said Wednesday that the state Board of Parole after a hearing this month found Anthony Bottom should be released from prison on or before Oct. 20. His parole follows that of co- defendant Herman Bell in 2018. Authorities have said the two were members of the Black Liberation Army, which sanctioned symbolic killings of police officers. Bottom and Bell claimed they were innocent and had been framed by the FBI.

During the work session, Cordon asked whether the board would like to see fourth and fifth grade return to in-person learning as soon as the metrics are met. The responses of the board members varied.
 “I think these kids need to be in the classroom if the metrics are allowing it,” director Brandon Bishop said. "I would love for these kids to return to the classroom."
 Director Micki Hall said she would prefer to err on the side of caution and not see the students go back-and-forth from in-person to online learning.
 Board chair Rebecca Larson said she agreed with Bishop, citing her own experience as a reference point.
 "I guess as a parent and as an educator, I'm just not sure how developmentally appropriate distance learning is for those younger kids," she said. "I'm worried about the kids. I mean, I look at how hard we're working in our house and my kids have a parent who is home with them all day, who can solve every technology problem, sit by them when they're confused, can go fix the printer jam. And not every kid in our district has that kind of privilege. And it breaks my heart. And I really, really worry about all of our kids, but in particular those little kids."
 Director Charles Lee was also a part of the discussion, but three other board members were absent from the work session.
 During the work session the school board also discussed:
 \- Bringing forth a capital improvement bond measure for the November 2021 ballot. The school district’s latest bond measure, in May 2020, was narrowly defeated with 52% voting against and 48% in favor of the bond. However, school board members said the issues that were raised during the May campaign continue to impact education.
 \- Reopening Rose Elementary School as both schools housed in the facility at this time will transition at the end of the current school year. Rose Alternative School will transition to Roseburg High School at the start of the 2021-2022 school year, and the Horizons Foster Youth Education Program has funding for the remainder of this school year.
 No decisions were made on any of the topics discussed in the work session.
 The next board meeting is scheduled for Oct. 14.

_Perché Il dubbio, pur denunciando la sua origine teatrale, si salva dalle sabbie mobili della trasposizione (considerando che il regista è l 'autore della piece) grazie alle prestazioni dei tre protagonisti e a una sceneggiatura che esula (e così facendo se ne avvantaggia) dai richiami all'attualità. Perché la piaga della pedofilia nelle istituzioni religiose non è sicuramente (e purtroppo) circoscritta agli Stati Uniti ma è lì che è esplosa con maggiore virulenza al punto di spingere la Chiesa a fare pubblica ammenda. Shanley si dimostra però interessato a tematiche diverse e più complesse. Il film non si risolve quindi in una detection sulla colpevolezza o meno di Padre Flynn o sulla forza dei pregiudizi di Sorella Aloysius. Il contrasto e la difficoltà di discernimento stanno soprattutto altrove. Non a caso la vicenda ha inizio l'anno successivo all'uccisione di John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Il trauma nella società è stato forte ma nel mondo qualcosa sta mutando per sempre. Lo testimonia la foto del 'papa morto' (Pio XII) che ormai viene usata per vedere il riflesso della classe quando l'insegnante è voltata verso la lavagna ma che la superiora non ha sostituito con quella del papa del Concilio. Il film non si limita ad affrontare il tema del rinnovamento della Chiesa negli Anni Sessanta ma va oltre affrontando il nodo della complessità della lettura della realtà. È sufficiente essere progressisti per liberarsi d'ufficio da qualsiasi possibilità di errore? Al contrario: chi è favorevole alla conservazione ha il diritto di leggere in chiave solo negativa i comportamenti che non si confanno alla norma e si ispirano invece a un'umanità più vicina agli ultimi? Sono solo alcuni dei quesiti che il film pone lasciando poi allo spettatore il compito di dare una risposta sulla base delle proprie convinzioni o (perché no?) dei propri dubbi.»_

"I never expected to have these results so fast. It's really exciting to have a shovel full of worms. That's what it is all about — the living stuff in your soil," Klein said. "All those worm holes are taking that water down into your soil rather than running across your field and into the streams. It's kind of exciting. I wasn't a big believer. It is a bit of a slow process. But I'm trying to do it just for soil health."
 Successful cover cropping has also saved Klein $50 an acre in reduced nitrogen use.
 There's plenty of skepticism in the farming community, a stigma and fear Klein and others have had to overcome.
 "First of all you have to make money to stay in business," he said. "If you ask my wife, it has been the most stressful thing on me. When you try something new, people are watching to see if you fail. You've got landlords and bankers and you can't fail. It's just the opposite way of how I've farmed the last 40 years."
 With about five years to go before he retires, Klein is thinking about his legacy. He's interested in some of the other principles of regenerative agriculture, like reduced tillage or eliminating pesticides and herbicides. But after losing a lot money two years ago when he planted the wrong type of clover for his particular region, he doesn't want to figure it all out on his own.
 "Now I am looking for knowledge. There aren't many people doing it in my part the country. What works in Minneapolis will not work here," Klein said.
 That's where Cargill comes in. By pooling resources, research and other farmers' experiences, Cargill hopes to connect all of the dots for farmers to advance the practice.
 Klein has already eliminated the use of anhydrous ammonia and is hoping Cargill can help him get away from nitrogen entirely.
 "It's my last hurrah to improve my land, to make it better for whoever gets it next. What's keeping me going is the cover crops, it's got me pumped up," Klein said. "Once I saw the erosion improve, the soil health improve and the weed control, I really jumped on the bandwagon. Because it is completely different from what I've done my whole life so it is kind of exciting."
 This new regenerative agriculture commitment is intentionally open-ended because of Cargill's direct relationship with the farmers means it is taking a more "farmer-led" approach.
 "As farmers adopt a new method, we will look to model the actual carbon improvement and water improvement of that farmer," Sirolli said.
 Cargill has many critics who say efforts such as its outreach in regenerative agriculture amount to a form of marketing called "greenwashing," or the appearance of environmental stewardship even as its profits from the growth of farming and practices that are sometimes harmful.
 But as the largest company in the food supply chain, Cargill is in a unique position to pull together various groups in any innovation in agriculture, said Jill Kolling, Cargill's vice president global sustainability. For example, last month it helped launch a five-year soil health project in Nebraska with McDonald's, Target and The Nature Conservancy, an NGO active in advancing regenerative agriculture.
 Steve Groff, a lifelong farmer and author of a new book "The Future-Proof Farm," said he is cautiously optimistic about Cargill's new commitment to a system he has been practicing for years.
 "I am supportive of this, but cautious. Some farmers are skeptical because history in agriculture is that typically corporations do not have the farmers' best interest in mind. They offer you a carrot, then you take the carrot, but then there are all kinds of strings attached," Groff said. "But just the fact that these big boys are doing more than just placating, more than just talking about it, they're going to do something about this, that alone helps."

This election season has demonstrated how stifled, polarized and dangerous our political differences have become, and college football can remind us of respect -- even in the wake of deep disagreement. We can root for different teams, scream at the players, argue with the refs and question the coaches, but win or lose, at the end of the day, we leave the stadium, watch party or tailgate with a sense of respect for the game and the athletes that train so hard, leaving it all out on the field every time. Indeed, if a player is injured, the entire stadium usually applauds, not just fans from one team.

Over our careers, we spend a lot of time in hotel rooms. In fact, we often travel to the far and frozen reaches of the Upper Midwest or Northeast and the weather isn’t conducive to getting out and about. I don’t think though, that I’ve ever been in a hotel room and known I can’t leave it for 36-48 hours. In some ways it was strange, but in other ways the usual routine of video conference meetings and some sports programming on in the background helped move things along.

--DocBreak--
In the first half, they looked to be in control and heading for a deserved, six point lead at the break with thanks to a Stephen Donnelly goal but no sooner had that goal been registered, than Liam Hickey kicked to the Thomastown net and the game was back in the melting pot at the break.   Similar scenario but in reverse in the second half. Lachtain’s levelled through Hickey’s second goal two minutes in to the half and a shock looked on but Thomastown showed great composure, with Donnelly this time the provider for Jonjo Farrell to finish from close range, keeping Thomastown three points up.   It was a tense closure to this game which had seven minutes of injury time. Thomastown’s nerves were tested, and they held firm to reach another final.   Their defence is solid and Thomastown use their half backs to deliver quality ball - players like Brian Murphy have really stood out this season in that regard. Daithi Barron was very lively at midfield and up front, John Donnelly worked hard to get on the ball and create in almost every one of the six forward positions. Apart from his two points, he won four frees that were converted.   And on that score they have a very accurate Robbie Donnelly from frees. Of course he is also a scoring threat from play, but a reliable free taker like Donnelly was crucial last Sunday. Stephen Donnelly at full forward was also a major scoring threat, a good eye for goal.   Early   Daithi Barron and a Robbie Donnelly free had the early scores on the board for Thomastown and after five minutes they were looking good, 0-4 to 0-1 in front.   But Freshford were causing them problems, most notably in the puck outs. When Noel McGree latched on to a break and let fly with a shot which was saved but not cleared, alarm bells rang.   That particular route from St Lachtain’s paid dividends, with pressure forcing frees as Liam Hickey converted, or nice points just like Darragh Maher in the 22nd minute.   With three minutes to the break, the score was 0-9 to 0-7, Thomastown just struggling to get a run until they got the game’s first goal - Dylan Caulfield slipping a pass to John Donnelly on the run, he drew the cover and found Stephen Donnelly who finished from close range. Now 1-10 to 0-7, overall it was a reflection of the general play but not of the effort of St Lachtain’s and that man Hickey, first with a free, and then winning a long clearance before kicking past Diarmuid Galway kept the Saints in contention, 1-11 to 1-9 after a half where 2-4 was scored in the final five minutes.
