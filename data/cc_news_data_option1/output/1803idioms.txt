And JD Cloud really fit that bill incredibly well. And so we signed an agreement with them. It's going to take us a little bit of time for us to get that online, but I'm incredibly excited about it. We're adding 50 new cities per year to a total of 150 PoPs across China that will augment the existing network that we have with Baidu.

Acting quickly, the Marines stacked up outside the lavatory and prepared to subdue the passenger while a flight attendant unlocked the door. The Marines seized the passenger and restrained him with flex ties.
 “I knew I had to step in when he became a danger to others and himself,” said Meinhardt, a mortarman from Sparta, Wisconsin. “I didn’t think twice about helping restrain him through the rest of the flight.”
 The Marines secured the unruly passenger to a seat and continued to provide security for the remainder of the flight.

Businesses, large and small, have an acute need for a fast, reliable, secure network now more than ever. They come to us every hour of every day, and we can have them up and running as quickly as a few hours or minutes compared to our competitors' weeks or months. And because of our short sales cycle, we can adapt quickly. As we came to understand that certain industries were going to be particularly impacted by the current crisis, we shifted our sales resources to thriving verticals, so our teams could still make their quarter.

Mark Bern, CFA: Every region is a little different. China seems well ahead of the curve but we expect its economy will be slow in returning to capacity because the rest of the world has yet to beginning consuming normally. Orders are being cancelled leaving Chinese companies unable to bring back all workers. Likewise, in Europe and the U.S., demand is down considerably with gasoline consumption falling by as much as 35%. Airlines everywhere are operating at very low capacity on the few planes still being used, some with scheduled flights reduced by 90%. Restaurants in Europe and the U.S. are being given the go ahead to open up but ordered to maintain social distancing. This translates to maybe 25% capacity and many cannot break even at that level. We think it will be a rough recovery that will take much longer than markets, at least in the U.S., seem to be pricing into stocks.

Tee times must be 15 minutes apart. Golfers must stay in their cars until 15 minutes before their tee times and return to their cars immediately following play. Flagsticks must remain in the holes and hole liners must be raised so golfers don't have to pick the ball out of the hole.

The Value Pendulum: The Hong Kong dollar is relatively resilient, because it is pegged to the US dollar, while most other Asian currencies have depreciated against the US dollar. Investors are exposed to foreign exchange risks, even if they solely invest in companies listed on the stock exchange in their home market. Most companies are also likely to have either foreign customers or foreign suppliers in today's connected world. In the long run, foreign exchange gains on stocks denominated in certain currencies will be offset by losses on others. More importantly, one can choose to avoid crystallizing such losses in the near term, by reinvesting capital gains and dividends from existing stocks (in X market) into new investment candidates that are denominated in the same currency.

Understood. Thank you for that color. And also, when we think about those new 1,000 team businesses that joined during the quarter, if we translate this number into subscribers, what could that be like? Is it 1 million, 2 million, 3 million? Whatever color you can share with us will be greatly appreciated. And also, if I can kind of sneak another one, what would you think the renewal rate as we start thinking about 2021 of those 1,000 team businesses once they convert, what this renewal rate might look like down the road? Thank you for that.

Beginning in early January, in light of the, at the time, unnamed virus, our infrastructure teams thoroughly analyzed our supply chain, identifying potential bottlenecks. We moved up some purchases of key components we thought may become constrained. This proved prescient. Thus far, we've been able to continue to receive the equipment we needed without meaningful delay in order to expand our network during this time of unprecedented demand.

One of the numbers -- pretty much across the board, numbers came in ahead of guidance and ahead of expectations. One number that came in a little bit below consensus expectations was free cash flow. You talked about some accelerated hardware purchases. There's also a lot of load on the overall network.

Network efficiency continues to be a defining strength of our business model, allowing us to absorb significantly higher rates of traffic and offer a critical solution like Cloudflare for Teams to new customers at no charge through September 1.

During this crisis, we are focused on doing the right thing for our customers today and for our business in the long term. Therefore, in second quarter, we expect to see gross margin closer to our long-term target of 75% to 77%.
