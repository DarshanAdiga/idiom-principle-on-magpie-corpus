“A new County Partnership Agreement (CPA) with the ECB for all First Class Counties includes new funding streams on the back of the media rights deal. For Derbyshire this means that we can now progress our plans to develop and improve the infrastructure at The Pattonair County Ground, by increasing our seating capacity, installing a new scoreboard, installing new toilets and enhancing our bars and concessions amongst other ground developments.
 “A great number of factors have led to this positive position at the end of the financial year and I would like to thank our Members, supporters and 1870 Business Club partners, and our Principal Partner, Pattonair, for their ongoing support.
 “I continue to be proud and appreciative of the positive, friendly and helpful attitude of everyone at Derbyshire County Cricket Club. While we know there is room to continue increasing our commercial revenue, I remain optimistic about the coming seasons as we continue to strive for success on and off- the- field.”
 Chief Executive, Ryan Duckett, added: “Our aims for the year were to enhance our customer experience, maintain and grow our commercial revenues, reduce our cost base and increase profitability in order to maintain our spending on cricket. I’m pleased to say we’ve been able to do that and we’re now in a position to plan for long-term sustainability and to be debt free by the end of the term of the new media rights agreement.

Like Jairus, the problem we face is that of trusting Him in the midst of our situations. Interestingly, we are not told of any words spoken by Jairus after his initial encounter with Jesus. It was as if he was at a loss for words; not knowing for sure if Jesus could do what He had promised. I have been there. But Jesus proved His authority over all things by raising the girl from the dead (vv. 37-42). Some two thousand years later, He is still a specialist in the things that seem impossible. Amidst all the negativity and impossible circumstances, He is still saying to you and me, "Don’t listen to what everybody else is saying, trust me." "Don't pay attention to what is going on around you, trust me." "Don't let doubt and fear fill your heart, trust me." "Don't be discouraged by it all, trust me." Those are not always easy things to do, yet what is the alternative? Personally, as difficult as it is sometimes, I have no other choice but to trust Him. What about you?

 It comes months the Chinese government ordered construction workers to build a six-acre, 1,000-bed, coronavirus hospital from scratch in seven days.
 The emergency facility, named the Huoshenshan or Fire God Mountain Hospital, is situated in the suburbs of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak which has killed at least 26, infected around 920 and spread to nine other countries and regions.
 The authorities instructed four construction companies to toil through the Chinese New Year holiday to build the medical centre.
 It received its first batch of patients after just 10 days of construction on February 4.
 Some 1,400 military medics were brought in from the People's Liberation Army to run the new hospital, which was made of revamped shipping containers and prefabricated buildings.

In investing if you give in to irrational fears from things like crisis crashes, as we’ve had with the recent virus, and sell off your holdings, you’re exacerbating the problem. When investors panic and sell, they take their depressed proceeds and wait for the crisis to be over. The problem is no one knows when the markets will recover, so even if you act quickly to get back in, you always miss a big slice of the recovery. Long-term, missing that rebound dooms your portfolio to be behind the curve. You’ll never get that big recovery bounce that we need to balance out the losses and gains over years of portfolio performance.
 Your OCCF enjoyed a great year in investing in 2019, we’ll also come back from the current downturn. Our board of directors and the Finance Committee use an Investment Policy that lays out our strategy for investing. Nowhere in that policy does it say, “If it looks scary out there, sell everything and hide.” The world will always muddle through, and if it doesn’t, I really don’t think anyone’s portfolio is going to be a concern. Relax. Take a walk in nature.
 So to recap, we’re having a wonderful life here in Owen County. Things happen. We keep doing what’s right and try to help our neighbors.
 I hope you find peace in the turmoil. I’ll just go about my business reciting a little mantra in my head, “Cabin. Lake. Fishing. Books.” Works for me. Hope you have a wonderfully random weekend.

Saurashtra won their maiden Ranji Trophy title on Friday on the back of their first innings lead against Bengal in the final played at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium. It is their first-ever win in the history of India's premier domestic competition. Saurashtra had posted 425 in their first innings riding on a brilliant century from Arpit Vasavada and gritty half- centuries from Avi Barot, Vishvaraj Jadeja and Cheteshwar Pujara.
 They then restricted Bengal on 381, thus taking a crucial lead of 44 runs on the final day of the match. Dharmendrasinh Jadeja was the pick of the bowlers as he scalped three wickets, while skipper Jaydev Unadkat and Prerak Mankad picked two wickets each.
 In their second innings, Saurashtra put up 105 runs for the loss of four wickets in the 34 overs they batted on the final day before the players shook hands and agreed on a mutual draw.
 According to the rules of the tournament, if the final match is heading towards the draw, then whoever manages to take the first-innings lead is declared as the winner.
 During the course of the game, Unadkat also broke a 21-year-old record as he became the fast bowler with most wickets in a single Ranji season. He picked up 65 wickets in the season and snapped the record which was previously held by Karnataka's Dodda Ganesh. The Karnataka pacer had bagged 62 wickets in 1998-99 season.
 After the match, Pujara -- who is India's batting mainstay when it comes to Test cricket -- said: "It's a great feeling and we are in a different world altogether. At the start of the season, we believed that we could win. Last season, we lost in the final, we had a chat after that and credit goes to the boys.
 "The best thing about this team is most of them have played cricket together for a long time. Everyone contributes at sometime or the other. Not many state teams play as a team. It's a nice unit and whenever I am here, I always feel comfortable. We are working towards one process and we got the title today."

They had performed valiantly with keeper Jacob Holding in inspired form, particularly after they had taken the lead on the stroke of half-time through Reagen Lymer.
 Owen Rowley finally found an equaliser midway through the second-half – but the game remained in the balance and on course for extra-time until Rob Thorley stepped up with an 85th-minute thunderbolt.
 Twin brother Tom Thorley then capped the evening for Castle with a last-minute header to make it 3-1 and ensure that the trophy stayed at Lyme Valley.
 It was also another feather in the cap for manager Steve Barker, who has continued to develop the team since he led them to the Sentinel Shield title as under-16s back in 2017.
 He said: “I thought Abbey played superbly well. The goal in the first half caught us off guard a little bit and then they defended their lead really well.
 “They made life really difficult for us. We knew their keeper would be hard to get past – and needing to get past him twice was very hard.
 “We changed the personnel at half-time. We didn’t think we got the ball wide enough in the first half, we didn’t stretch the pitch well enough, and that seemed to do the trick in terms of momentum, but the goals still didn’t come.

Thurles hasn’t always been a happy hunting ground for Limerick GAA followers over the years but both Herbertstown NS and Kilbehenny NS were placed first in their categories at the Cumann na mBunscol Awards which are sponsored by Cornmarket Financial Services.   The Awards banquet which took place in the Anner Hotel last Friday night saw Kilbehenny NS named as ‘Small School of the Year’ while Herbertstown NS was winner of the category for Promotion of Gaelic Games and Culture.   Kilbehenny NS was also runner-up in that category while Herbertstown NS was placed third in the Small School of the Year category.   Limerick won another title when The Green and White magazine was once again named as Best Publication.   The Cumann na mBunscol Awards, sponsored by Cornmarket Financial Services have long occupied a special place in the Cumann na mBunscol calendar.   The local Committee, led by Cathaoirleach Paddy Kelly, spared no effort in their preparations for the weekend and the presence of Liam Sheedy, coach of the All-Ireland hurling champions, as guest speaker was the icing on the cake.   “The Cornmarket Cumann na mBunscol Awards highlight the huge range of work that goes on in schools the length and breadth of the country in the promotion of Gaelic Games” said Liam Magee, Chairman of Cumann na mBunscol.   “‘It is fitting that the Awards banquet takes place in Thurles where the GAA was founded. Let’s not forget that the driving force behind the movement was a teacher, Michael Cusack.”   Cumann na mBunscol promotes Gaelic Games in primary schools throughout the island of Ireland and beyond.   Herbertstown National School were popular winners of the Promotion of Gaelic Games and Culture category.   The County Limerick school was nominated in two categories as was a neighbouring school in South Limerick, Kilbehenny NS, who were runners- up to Herbertstown NS in the category for Promotion of Gaelic Games and Culture.   Michael Fitzgerald is the driving force behind the Cumann na mBunscol activity in Herbertstown NS and the large group that travelled from the school were delighted to see his efforts rewarded.   Kilbehenny NS was placed second in the Small School Category last year but the school went one better this year and was named as Small School of the Year for 2020. Located on the border of Limerick, Cork and Tipperary, Kilbehenny NS was also nominated in two categories this year.   Principal Stephen Walsh, a former Limerick hurler himself, and his staff are steeped in Gaelic Games.   From humble beginnings in 1996, The Green and White magazine has gone from strength to strength.   Total sales of Limerick’s favourite GAA magazine now stand at over 350,000 copies.   Ever conscious of the need to be accessible to readers, whether young and not so young, the magazine maintains a strong presence on social media.   As well as making the magazine available to read on-line, the site contains all the latest Cumann na mBunscol news from Limerick’s 4 GAA divisions.   Edited by Ciaran Crowe and Joe Lyons, the success of the magazine is due to the backing of Limerick County Board and the support of the clubs within the county.   Tipperary manager Liam Sheedy came straight from a training session at Semple Stadium. Liam spoke of the positive influence which teachers have on their pupils and praised the volunteerism which drives   Schools from all over Ireland entered this year’s Awards. The Large School of the Year Award went to Creevy NS from Ballyshannon in Co. Donegal while the Award for the Promotion of Gaeilge and was won by Gaelscoil na Cruaiche from Mayo.
