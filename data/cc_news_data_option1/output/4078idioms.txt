AUGUSTA -- What looked like a one-sided game for Augusta, turned into a 21-6 deficit by Winfield but eventually ended into a game-winning finish by the Orioles.
   
 Augusta survived a comeback play, defeating the Vikings 41-35 on Saturday, earning its second win on the season.
   
 "We made huge plays tonight. You go from being from really good to really bad really fast and it was just a lot of swings of momentum," Augusta Head coach Jason Filbeck said after the game. "I told our kids that the resilience that we showed was the best thing about it."
   
 From the start of the game, special teams play played a role in Friday's shootout. On the opening kickoff, Tyler McConathy took one to the house for 90 yards, which set the tone for the Orioles. For the Vikings, it was the second week in a row that they gave up an opening kickoff touchdown.
   
 "Special teams is a big deal for us," Filbeck said. "Honestly, special teams won us a lot this game other than, we missing an extra point at the end of the game. Gave them a shot to tie it."
   
 Both teams put up a total of 741 yards on offense, but most were on the ground. In the first half, Augusta struggled to contain Winfield's power back, Ar'mon Acosta, who finished the night with 230 yards on 24 carries, and a touchdown.
   
 "Credit to the Winfield kids for sticking with it," Filbeck said. "Their quarterback and runningback are really good, and they leaned on them and they were back in it. I told my kids that I will be okay with a blowout every now and then. Win an easy game and I can relax. But high school football is exciting too, so I'm okay with being excited."
   
 Augusta also focused on pounding the rock by Ryan Andrews. Andrews finished the night with 146 yards on 16 carries.
   
 Despite focusing on the run play, Winfield still struggled to put points on the board as they trailed 28-12 at halftime. In the second half, quarterbacks Jett Hand of Augusta and Riley Yingling of Winfield duked it out in a back and forth battle.
   
 As Winfield lured away Acosta's carries after being injured late in the third quarter, it Yingling who stepped up to the plate as he rushed for four touchdowns. One of it tied the game at 35 with 1:49 left in the fourth quarter immediately after a disastrous fumble on punt at Augusta's three-yard line.
   
 Hand orchestrated 80 yards of offense with a minute left. Andrews made a 19-yard run while being gang tackled by Winfield defenders. With 17 seconds left, Hand made a check down call and found Andrews on a vertical route for an 8-yard touchdown to recapture the lead and the win for the Orioles.
   
 "He stepped up big," Filbeck said. "He ran the ball really well too. He got a little bit of moxie into him. Slings the ball around a little bit, and we have to throw it at the end a little bit. I called a different play and he checked Ryan and told him to go vertical, he'll be open. He wasn't supposed to hit Ryan first on that. He just saw it and hey, do it. So Ryan did it, made a quick hot throw and scored a game-winner for us."
   
 Hand finished the night completing seven of his 11 passes. Three of them resulted in touchdowns from Andrews, Ely Wilcox and Sebastian Flowers. Holt Williams also picked up a short-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter.
   
 Augusta improves to 2-4 on the season, and will now focus on Abilene next week Friday at 7 p.m.

Hi there first time posting, I recently revived some old hardware that I had built an arcade cabinet out of about 20 years ago. I have it up and running on a Lenovo m58 tower, running Tiny 7 (windows 7) and gameex frontend everything working and running fine. of course I can't stop there so I tried booting up Recalbox and really liked the speed increase in the games and the added emulators it brought to the table. Now here is my issue and question. my control panel is one Ipac (old PS/2 version) running 2 players and then a separate Optipac (old serial cable version) running a trackball and a spinner. I've seen several threads on how to get usb ipac versions to run. but nothing yet on these old beasts. Am I completely out of luck thinking I'll get them to function in Recalbox? i'd love to switch my setup to be a Recalbox Cabinet. any help or pointers would be appreciated. or tell me i'm crazy to even attempt to figure it out. The reason i mention the current setup is just to say that it all does work, and everything is running fine through windows and separate emulators. so i know the hardware is up and working. so its a config thing at this point.

Corn and Kansas crops go hand in hand. This year's Sunflower State crop is forecast at just under 800 million bushels. This is down 2% from last year, according to the USDA.
   
 For Haven farmers, Bob Bacon and his son-in-law Daniel Kelly, it's an average year.
   
 "It was looking really good early on," Kelly said. "But August was hot and dry."
   
 On Friday, Kelly and Bacon's corn field brought in about 220 bushels an acre.
   
 "But our other fields are lower," Kelly said. "We'll probably finish at about 200."
   
 For Jake Amerin, a farmer in Plains, this year's corn harvest was below average by about 20 bushels. Amerin runs Sunny Farm with his father.
   
 "We got done on Thursday, but most of our neighbors are still cutting," Amerin said. "Our yield was below average too."
   
 Amerin said he thought his low yield on his one thousand acres of non- irrigated corn was a combination of not getting rain and a low water table.
   
 According to the USDA, this year's average yield of the 5.75 million acres planted is forecast at 137 bushels per acre. This is up by four bushels from 2019.
   
 As of Oct. 5, 44% of Kansas corn was harvested. This is 34% ahead of last year, but according to the USDA, behind the 49% average by this time during the past five years. More than half of the corn already harvested is either good or excellent, with about one-firth ranked at poor or very poor.
   
 Forty percent of Kelly and Bacon's irrigated corn fields needed to be replanted because of this spring's rains. For them, the test weight was 61.
   
 Kelly and Bacon planted a cover crop between the corn rows and were excited to see the radishes and triticale blossom as they cut the stalks. Usually they bring in steers to feed on the field. This year, they are letting a cow/calf operation feed on the residual.
   
 "One of my main goals is to significantly decrease the amount of my input costs," Kelly said. "I think there's more opportunity to be more than what we are now. We're willing to try just about everything."

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - An Alabama company is now making face coverings for lawmakers in the United States Capitol complex.HomTex is a textile manufacturer in Cullman, Alabama that began making masks back in March after making luxury sheets for more than 30 years.“We will be the largest US manufacturer of disposable masks in the country,” HomTex VP of Sales for PPE division Maury Lyon said. “The Senate, Congress, all of their staff, visitors, and I also believe it is the White House.”Lyon said HomTex submitted their masks to the United States Capitol complex back in May, but just sent the first order last week, providing 200,000 masks.“We have them in black and white and you will start to see some of our leaders wearing them around which is awesome and it is made in Alabama," Lyon said. “It really is a testament to our ownership, our employees in Cullman."Lyon said the masks are made entirely in the United States.“It is amazing, because you think about all the famous words that have been said in that building," Lyon said. "Those words will be said, will be uttered in the history of our country wearing our masks, which is really special.”Lyon said seeing HomTex’s face coverings on lawmakers is something for people in Alabama to be proud of“Whether you agree with masks or not, it’s a courtesy or in some cases mandatory, and so maybe that gives a little extra incentive to wear it because it was made in your home state or your home country," Lyon said.Lyon said the company hopes to keep providing masks on a monthly basis to lawmakers.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

I'd never heard of the 1984 book "The War with Grandpa" by children's author Robert Kimmel Smith. I only knew that Robert De Niro played the grandfather in the film and that it was a comedy.      Yes, Robert De Niro does play the grandfather. It's not very funny. I have no plans to read the book.      A Google search showed that age recommendations for the book are 9-13. I'd lower those ages for the film, probably from 6-12, but no younger because the content is a little dicey when it gets around to kids pulling dangerous pranks.      Those 6- to 12-year-olds will probably lap up the shenanigans on display. But I just couldn't cotton to any of it (save a good De Niro performance). Some of the story is fun and, OK, some of the slapstick bits are funny. But there are far too many that aren't, and too many border on being cruel (not funny).      The protagonists are 12-year-old Peter (Oakes Fegley, terrific in "Wonderstruck"), and his grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro, darn good in "Taxi Driver"). Ed is a recent widower, now living alone is a house filled with memories. He's convinced by his daughter Sally (I didn't recognize it was Uma Thurman till halfway through) to move in with her, husband Arthur (Rob Riggle), Peter, and his younger and older sisters - cute Jenny (Poppy Gagnon) and boy-crazy Mia (Laura Marano).      The seeds of the tale of conflict are found in the parents' decision to put Ed in Peter's bedroom, and consign Peter to the unfinished attic. Peter is not thrilled. In fact, since he's 10, and maturity hasn't quite set in, he's angry - selfish without realizing it.      His friends at school, upon finding out about the dilemma, persuade him to go to war with grandpa, with the goal of getting his room back. Peter slips a scrawled Declaration of War under grandpa's door (the spoils of it being his room). At the same time, Ed's local longtime pals Jerry (Christopher Walken) and Danny (Cheech Marin) are shown the Declaration, and convince him that he must "respond to this sort of aggression."      That's the whole movie. Peter is a nice kid, Grandpa is a nice guy. Peter becomes incensed at the unfairness of the situation and stops being nice. Grandpa tries to calm him down. Peter won't be calmed.      Bring on the pranks, initially small-time innocent stuff like an alarm going off at 3 a.m., which escalates to booby traps that toss grandpa up in the air and down on the floor. The antics go back and forth, and are joined by pratfalls, forced overacting (except for De Niro, who manages to keep some dignity in his role), mood swings that turn on a dime from resentment to adoration on the part of Fegley, and the pointless presence of the annoying older sister who, I've since been informed, isn't even in the book.      There's also the question of what the heck Jane Seymour is doing in the film, as a new friend of Ed. It's a thankless part that gets her involved in a "winner takes all" seniors versus kids trampoline dodgeball game, with Pete's bedroom as the prize. I somehow made it through the tortuous, slo-mo, knockabout sequence and then, for you, dear reader, backed it up and watched it again, this time with a stopwatch. It lasts six long minutes, plenty of time for a bathroom break.      Things get serious. Ed orates a message to Peter: "War is no game. Only kids and fools and generals think that. War hurts and wounds and kills and causes misery. We've gotta end this somehow."      They do, but not before the film dips into a predictable and vanilla birthday party sequence for little Jenny, and then conveniently but unconvincingly ties up all of the story's problems in a big bow.      "The War with Grandpa" opens in theaters on Oct. 9.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "The War with Grandpa"   Written by Tom J.

"It was a stressful time but I was actually working as a receptionist at a nursing home in Lexington, so I had a total different outlook of (the virus) — just seeing families that couldn't be together and their frustrations," she described. "It was definitely hard and they were all so desperate. I was working seven days a week for the first four months of (the pandemic), so it was definitely really hard.”
 She was asked how much the nursing home was hit with the virus.
 "There were a lot of cases at that home including staff and patients. It was hard answering the phones and dealing with the families who just wanted to see their loves ones and couldn't. It was heartbreaking. Just knowing the relationship that I have with my grandparents and the thought of not being able to be with them, see them, spend birthdays with them and holidays with them. That was definitely tough and it did take a toll on me.
 “It was also insightful to see how this virus has impacted so many people and it teaches you how to be grateful for everything that you have in your life. That's why it's kind of frustrating right now when you see people refusing to wear masks. I have seen what it really does to people and those who are affected with it."
 She added that her father, Jeff, works at the same nursing home in the maintenance department, and luckily he never contacted COVID-19.
 "I wasn't working directly with the people who had it, but my father works in the maintenance department and he was actually going into the rooms of the people who had it, so that was really scary for me. If he got it, he could have spread it to my whole family, so all of that was definitely something that was scary and still is, but as of right now there are no cases there so that's a great sign," she said.
 Since both of them are safe and healthy, Carissa was able to get a good six week of workouts and training in, mostly during the mornings before she headed off to her job.
 "Carissa is a great runner and she too has done a lot of work to get ready for this season," said head coach Brian Schell. "One of the big things that she did was she helped the younger girls when they came to the summer workouts. She showed them around with the streets and the routes and just getting them ready for the season. Some of the freshmen have already come into this season looking poised and like they know what they are doing so I can thank Carissa for taking care of that. She's done a great job of leading, especially with these younger girls."
 The Wildcats’ season will get underway on Saturday with a meet against Burlington. It wil be the first official meet that Rubin and her teammates will run 5,000 meters with a mask covering their face – although if the runners are six feet apart during the race the mask can be moved down off their faces.
 "It's been difficult to train with the mask and to get oxygen to all parts of my body," she admitted. "My main focus is just to be and stay healthy and accommodate myself to all of these new rule changes and style of running. It's really hard because the masks just dries everything up – your breathing dries up and you are trying to get oxygen so you can pump your legs and your arms, so it definitely has been challenging.
 “We have tried to do things with social distancing – I know once you get into the woods and you are six feet apart, you can take it down. But wearing the mask has been a struggle and I think it'll continue to be a struggle for the next few months."
 When the cross-country season comes to an end, hopefully there will be an indoor track season and after that hopefully an outdoor track season. As much as she loves the cross-country season, those two track seasons will mean more to her for one major reason, her younger sister Lily.
 "She is a junior and she does winter and spring track," said Carissa. "She likes doing the throwing and the shot put. We are best friends. It's great that we are so close in age so we can go through the same motions in life together. It's really fun having a best friend built in like that. When we were able to be together on the track teams, that was really fun as well. It was different, but I really enjoyed it."

But, specifically in Modena, what is universally recognized is its production of balsamic vinegar.      On a visit to Modena, I entered a room filled with rows of barrels that dated back to the 16th and 17th centuries, and where the aroma of balsamic vinegar permeated the air in a most welcoming way. I was here for a tour through Giuseppe Giusti's museum and barrel room. The Giusti family began producing balsamic vinegar in 1605.      "We've been paying taxes here for more than 400 years," Claudio Stefani Giusti, CEO, says with a laugh.      Giusti is a 17th-generation producer in Modena, the undisputed epicenter of Lamborghini, Maserati and Alfa Romeo. As Modena's oldest producers, the Giusti family has created an on-site, 10-room Museum of Balsamic Vinegar, full of artifacts and memorabilia. It is here that Giusti explains balsamic vinegar's humble beginnings.      "Balsamic vinegar is an old product -- typical and traditional but not naturally occurring. It's the result of the fruit of the region combined with the people of the region.      "Just imagine picking the grapes and extracting their juice. In Modena, wine made from local lambrusca grapes is not particularly good, and wine made from trebbiano grapes is simply 'not bad.' So, the grape juice we extract is concentrated by being cooked down. The result is saba, or mosto, a sweet-ish condiment to enhance the taste of food."      As there was no refrigeration in those early days, the leftover mosto slowly oxidized in a process called acetobacter, which removes the liquid's natural alcohol. The resulting syrupy, sweet/sour vinegar -- known as balsamic since the 1800s -- tastes better and better as it ages.      The word balsamic is based on the Latin word balsam, or "to feel better." One legend has it that a duke hoping for favor from Rome sent a barrel of balsamic to the Pope, who claimed to prefer this gift to the 100 horses presented to him by another area duke.      In Modena today, tradition dictates that when a girl is born, a row of vinegar barrels is set up. When the girl gets married, those well-aged barrels become her dowry.      In 1863, one of Giuseppe Giusti's forebears presented a paper during a trade show in Modena, defining balsamic vinegar and how to make it. He specified which types of grapes to use, and even what type of wood to make the aging barrels. At that time, the correct barrels had to be 20 years old, and the vinegar needed to live in the barrels a minimum of two years.      Paraphrased through generations, his instructions were to use juniper wood or a non-aromatic wood such as mulberry in the beginning, and oak at the end. In the middle, use cherry or chestnut. It's important that the vinegar tastes of all the different woods that house it. Giusti explains that after 15 years the vinegar begins to get good, and after 30 years much better. After 50 years, it deserves the name balsamic.      This 150-year-old trade show speech is still known and widely quoted today as The Giusti Recipe. Today, balsamic vinegar can be made in just 60 days. Of course, the longer the product sits in the barrels, the more special it becomes.      In the Giusti family barrel rooms in Modena, no barrel is less than 100 years old. In fact, some of the barrels occasionally require renovation.      "If a barrel falls apart," says Giusti, "you have to build a new barrel around it, so as not to disturb the product."      The price of good balsamic vinegar begins at $20 and can range upward to $300, but much like fine wine, there is often no real way to determine if the liquid inside the bottle is superior or not.      "In the final analysis, balsamic is a condiment," says Giusti. "You can classify it one way or the other, but you just never know its quality until you taste it."

In front of an Agway garden and pet supply store in Montpelier, Vermont, a sign announces "World's Largest Zucchini Here." The grower, store employee Ron Sholtz, told WCAX Sept. 28 that his state-record 115-pound specimen is currently the largest zucchini on Earth, according to an unnamed international body that keeps track of such things.      His green, warty cylinder sits massively on a sturdy, hay-strewn table, a reminder of the intense power of a zucchini plant -- the same unstoppable growth force that fuels a zucchini's takeover of your garden, quietly building dark submarines in the prickly undergrowth as your attention is distracted by the bounty of summer. By the time the zucchini is big enough to trip over, your options are limited. But even if you have a zucchini that is up to the size of a baseball bat, your specimen can still find a little purpose in a loaf of zucchini bread.      To be clear, a large zucchini has less flavor, more bitterness, a tougher peel and large, woody seeds. It could feed a small city if you could only get someone to eat it.      There is no shame in bailing on an overgrown zucchini. You owe nothing to each other. But if you have the freezer space, and a desire to bake zucchini bread through the winter, then bust out the grater and save that monstrosity in a form that could be of use down the road. Peel and seed your large zucchini until you are left with nothing but solid white flesh, and run it through the grater's largest holes. (With zucchini smaller than a wine bottle you can skip the peeling and seeding.)      Add a half-teaspoon of salt for each pound of zucchini, and squeeze out as much water as you can, either in a colander or nut milk bag. Freeze the grated zucchini in an airtight freezer bag, with no air pockets and flat enough to stack neatly and space-efficiently. That pound of zucchini will yield about a cup of grated product, ready to give body to your muffins or perhaps a savory soup.      Meanwhile, the season of fresh zucchini isn't over yet. At my friend Luci's farm, October is zucchini stuffing month. Luci originally conceived the recipe during a quick walk to the kitchen one summer afternoon, as a kind of unstuffed zucchini.      She had to make enough lunch to feed 10 hungry farmhands and kids. And she wanted to do something with her overload of unsold -- but not oversized -- zucchini.      "What I really wanted was stuffed zucchini because it's so yummy, but didn't have time to bake it, much less stuff it. I always try to do one pot meals for lunch -- I have a huge kettle. So I added the ingredients for stuffed zucchini and kind of stirred it around."      Inside Out Stuffed Zucchini, as she originally called it, evolved to include sage and chicken stock and other stuffing flavorings, so it tastes like something that was cooked inside a bird for hours. It has that richness, even without any gravy. The croutons are mushy but just chewy enough, the meat is dark and savory, the herbs are aromatic, and the zucchini melts into a juicy sauce that brings it all together. It's a good warm up for fall, if not the best part of the holidays.      The guiding principle of this dish is it should taste like stuffing. When in doubt, advance that principle. The sage, croutons, onions and chicken stock do their jobs, elevated by the zucchini and meat. Luci uses stale, hard bread that she keeps frozen for this purpose. I have been very happy with bagged croutons from the store.      Sage Zucchini Stuffing   Serves 4-6   • 1 pound ground beef or sausage   • 1 medium onion, chopped   • 2 cloves garlic, chopped   • ¼ cup olive oil   • ¼ to ½ cup fresh sage, coarsely chopped   • ¼ teaspoon fresh grated nutmeg or ½ teaspoon dried   • 1 teaspoon powdered coriander (or whole coriander toasted in a dry pan and then crushed)   • 1 teaspoon paprika (or hot pepper flakes)   • ½ teaspoon black pepper   • 1 teaspoon salt   • 4 cups croutons or cubed white bread, either lightly toasted or dried out   • 3 pounds zucchini, cut in half lengthwise then sliced into ½ inch thick pieces   • 2 cups chicken stock      Fry the meat in the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan until it reaches your desired shade of brown, stirring as necessary for even cooking. Add the onions, garlic and spices, and cook until the onions melt into oblivion.      Add the breadcrumbs and zucchini and stir it all together really well. Add the stock and cover. Turn down to low and gently simmer until the stock is gone, about 10 minutes. Let sit covered for 10 minutes, then serve. Being stuffing, it goes with anything.

Actually much more so, and that's the next thing we ought to look at. Unlike federal employees, there's no precedent for government contractors to receive back pay when the shutdown ends, so that income is just gone. Black-owned firms comprise just 2 percent of all small businesses in the country but they make up 11.7 percent of registered federal contractors. That's almost the proportion that black Americans make up in the population. Another way to put that would be, black employees are overrepresented by about 150 percent in federal employees, but black firms are overrepresented by 550 percent in federal government contracting. I say that with the caveat that we don't know exactly how that trickles down to folks wages. But by and large, black-owned firms are going to be hit much harder by the shutdown.

Bowling Green - Alene Crowe Burks, age 94 of Bowling Green, passed away Sunday, October 4, 2020, with her family at her side. She was born March 31, 1926 in Tompkinsville, KY to the late Clint and Nova Lou Crowe.
 She had a larger than life personality, loving people, loving life and always ready to laugh and make others laugh. Alene especially loved children, serving as a public school teacher for over 52 years, the last 32 as a librarian at Potter Gray Elementary. She began her teaching career in the one room schools in Monroe County, Kentucky at age 17. She would teach during the school term and go to Western in the summers.
 It was there she, who was an excellent skater, met her husband Gene Burks, who was not such a good skater, at the skating rink at Beech Bend Park. They were married for 68 years before he preceded her in death. She also worked at Castner Knott home store for many years, sold World Book book encyclopedias, and alongside her family owned and operated the Soap & Suds laundromat located in the "old" mall. Alene loved to travel, spend time with family and friends, and go boating on Barren River Lake. She was a member of Eastwood Baptist Church and the Briarwood Homemakers. She didn't care for cooking or cleaning, but did love to decorate for every occasion, especially Christmas.

 # Football | Pirates roll to first-round win
 Jonah Rosenblum
 Record-Courier
 PALMYRA TWP. — Punt. Punt. Punt. Punt. Punt.
 After the Panthers and Pirates exchanged five punts to start Saturday's Region 17 first-round game, Southeast had an answer.
 A heavy dose of Jaidyn Sapp.
 The Pirates turned to their hard-charging junior running back for four straight carries as they plunged 52 yards down the field into the end zone to break Saturday's scoreless stalemate.
 Southeast was off and running en route to a 35-6 victory over Buckeye Local at newly-renovated Freedom Field.
 "It was what we needed," Pirates coach Pat Youel said of that first touchdown drive. "I thought that was going to be our shot in the arm and it was."
 In addition to opening their spruced up stadium, replete with new bleachers and press box, with a win, the Pirates (4-3) also earned their first-ever postseason victory.
 "Today meant a lot to these seniors," Youel said. "We haven't had a chance to play in here yet this year, in our stadium, and so honestly that was one of the things, and I told the kids, 'Again, people can say whatever they want, we didn't make the rules, the OHSAA did and this is a playoff contest,' and so for us to play our first-ever home game in this stadium in school history and for us to win the first-ever playoff game in school history, we didn't make the rules, someone else did, we're living by them, so I'm super proud of our kids."
 Once Sapp got the Pirates running, they were a finely-tuned automobile, as Sapp's hard runs freed up space for junior quarterback Aidan Fischer on Southeast's next drive, including a 16-yard keeper that paired with a horse- collar tackle put the Pirates in Panthers' territory. Four straight Fischer keepers later in the drive put Southeast at the Buckeye 9 and Sapp (18 carries, 153 yards, 2 TDs) polished the drive off with a 9-yard touchdown run around left end.
 "We thought we could maybe wear them down a little bit," Youel said. "As the drives went on, we were able to wear them down a little bit, and when you got to tackle that kid (Sapp) over and over and over again, it makes it tough."
 Down 14-0, the Panthers (1-6) nearly answered before the half as quarterback Hayden Taylor kept rolling out of the pocket and firing short passes to negate the Pirates' advantage up front.
 Until the red zone, that is.
 That's when Southeast's defensive front reared its head again, sending a pack of pass rushers after Taylor and forcing a fumble for a loss of 21. A subsequent fourth-and-goal pass from the 26 fell incomplete and back came the Pirates.
 On third-and-2 from the Southeast 45 with less than a minute remaining until halftime, Fischer (20 carries, 168 yards, 2TDs) took off around the left end with plenty of space. Twelve yards in, having already gotten the first down, the quarterback faced a choice. Step out of bounds and stop the clock or take a risk.
 "I was going to go out of bounds," Fischer said. "I was like I'm going to take this out of bounds and I saw the opening, I took the cut and it just worked for me and I had my blockers and everything."
 Fischer danced and shuffled as blockers and defenders intermingled in front of him until the junior found his seam down the left hash for a 55-yard touchdown run and a 21-0 lead at the half.
 "It was multiple cuts," Fischer said. "I'd weave in between people. I knew I had to score right here because if I didn't score, coach would have ripped me."
 It was back to Sapp to start the second half, as the junior running back instinctively felt his way around the left end and burst free for 36 yards. Two plays later, a fake handoff to Sapp worked to perfection with Fischer bursting untouched around the right end for a 15-yard score.
 "We're a tailback-based offense," Youel said. "That's just what we are and so your tailback sets up everything else that we want to do off of it."
 Senior Hayden Kittle tacked on a goal-line plunge to extend the the Southeast lead to 35-0 before Buckeye Local found the scoreboard early in the fourth on an 11-yard run around right end by Noah Kourim. That was the only score surrendered Saturday by the Pirates' defense, which gave up some yardage in the short passing game but was stellar in stuffing the Panthers' run game.
 "Our defensive line, Spencer Mesaros, Vinnie Sanderfer, Nate Buckeye, Zander Solidy, they've been the anchor of our defense," Youel said. "Hayden Kittle and Joe Percy, our front six have been incredible all year."
 As Youel reflected on Southeast's first-ever postseason win and thought ahead to a second-round battle with Crestview, he held the game ball, riding his fingers along the gentle bumps of the pigskin, then juggling it from one hand to the other.
 Would he ever let go?
 "I don't know," Youel said. "It will probably end up in a case somewhere because it's not mine, it's the school's."

The Kansas Department of Labor has halved the backlog of residents waiting for their unemployment claims to be settled, Acting Secretary Ryan Wright said in an interview Thursday, with the agency "on track" to wipe out the remaining claims in the coming weeks.
   
 The department is seeking to recover from a tumultuous few months, with the unemployment compensation system overwhelmed with the number of claimants seeking benefits due to economic fallout related to COVID-19.
   
 The fallout resulted in the resignation of Labor Secretary Delia Garcia, with Gov. Laura Kelly vowing to make changes in the department, though she also said Garcia inherited a department that had been "gutted" by former Gov. Sam Brownback.
   
 But Wright, who replaced Garcia in June, said a backlog of 25,000 claims has been reduced by half since August.
   
 KDOL staff have said that chipping away at that number would be straightforward with some IT fixes, and Wright said additional staffing had played a major role as well.
   
 Once the backlog in the regular unemployment system is addressed, the agency will turn to lags in payments for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which temporarily expands unemployment to self-employed individuals affected by COVID-19.
   
 "We think we've turned a corner. We know there are still frustrations with the agency and we know we still have some problems in the PUA system," Wright told The Topeka Capital-Journal. "But we are doing everything in our power to make sure folks get paid."
   
 The agency is also expanding its efforts to halt fraud in the PUA program, a nationwide problem that has taken hold in Kansas as well.
   
 Many residents have received letters notifying them of their unemployment claims, which they say they never applied for.
   
 The scams have been focused on the PUA program because states scrambled to build out that system on the fly during the pandemic while applications simultaneously flooded in.
   
 Wright said the department has caught 55,000 fraudulent applications, a far cry from the handful of unemployment fraud cases he said KDOL generally uncovers each year.
   
 He acknowledged, however, that some claims may have been paid out to scammers.
   
 "I would be lying to you if I said some of these did not get through," Wright said. "Of course, when you're talking about these kinds of numbers, we know some of them have been paid out. We definitely stopped the bulk of these from being paid out."
   
 In response, KDOL has been boosting its backend security controls designed to identify bots that may be perpetrating fraudulent applications, as well as coordinating with other states and the U.S. Department of Labor.
   
 And earlier this week, the agency rolled out a website for those who believe they have been a victim of fraudulent activity, which often indicates identify theft.
   
 As of Thursday, 17,376 users have filed a report using the new website, KDOL said.
   
 Users who do so will be advised on steps to take to protect their credit, as well as open a report within KDOL, which can act as a law enforcement agency in investigating potential fraudsters.
   
 While the state now has added the Lost Wages Assistance Program to its array of unemployment aid, Wright said it was unlikely the fraud could be duplicated there.
   
 LWAP will give Kansans already receiving unemployment benefits an additional $300 per week, and that means residents will already have gone through the heightened security checks associated with the regular unemployment programs.
   
 "Those should be good claims that we can pay out without any huge concern about fraud," Wright said.

LAWRENCE -- The coronavirus pandemic has reached one of college football's most recognizable figures.
   
 Les Miles, the second-year Kansas football head coach, announced Thursday afternoon that he has tested positive for COVID-19. In a news release, Miles said he has begun to self-isolate at his home but will continue to fulfill his head coaching duties remotely.
   
 "Although I will not physically be able to attend practice for the time being, I will be using the technology available for remote working to stay connected during staff meetings, meetings with players, etc.," Miles said in a statement. "Thank you for your prayers and support in advance."
   
 Miles tested positive for COVID-19 through the athletic department's surveillance testing program, KU athletic director Jeff Long said in a statement. Long expects Miles will continue to be able to perform his head coaching duties and, barring the development of any symptoms or a fever, anticipates Miles will coach the Jayhawks' next game, an 11 a.m. Oct. 17 contest at West Virginia in Morgantown, W.Va.
   
 "Based on the other test results, no other coaches tested positive," Long said.
   
 Miles, who won a national championship with LSU, has compiled a 3-12 record at the helm of the rebuilding Jayhawks. He attended his weekly "Hawk Talk" radio program Wednesday night at Johnny's Tavern, 721 Wakarusa Dr., where he acknowledged he was battling "a cold."
   
 "Kansas Team Health is working through the contact tracing protocols and notifying those individuals that may have been in close contact with him for an extended period of time," Long said. "We wish Coach a speedy recovery and look forward to getting him back on the field very soon."
   
 A spokesperson for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health told The Topeka Capital-Journal that the department is "working closely with the University of Kansas to identify potential close contacts" to Miles.
   
 "At this point, after communication with KU and the owner of Johnny's Tavern West, we would not consider those in general attendance at Wednesday night's airing of Hawk Talk to be at high risk for exposure," said George Diepenbrock, communications officer for Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health. "This is based on the protocols they had in place and implemented for the show, including social distancing, mask wearing during restaurant movement and use of plexiglass barriers."
   
 Under new protocols announced Sept. 7, attendees at "Hawk Talk" events are required to wear masks upon entry into the restaurant, with at least 6 feet of space separating the audience from Miles and co-host Brian Hanni. Miles and Hanni, who are separated by "clear dividers," have been instructed not to sign autographs or otherwise interact with guests.
   
 Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health's disease investigators label as "close contacts" any persons who spend more than 10 minutes within 6 feet of an individual who tests positive for COVID-19, relevant to any interactions within 48 hours of that patient's onset of symptoms, Diepenbrock said.
   
 "When close contacts are identified, a public health contact tracer will make contact and notify them they've potentially been exposed and that they need to quarantine for 14 days since their last exposure," Diepenbrock said. "Because risk of COVID-19 transmission is present in the community right now, we encourage anyone who feels symptomatic right now to self-quarantine and contact their healthcare provider."
   
 Miles, 66, was on the sideline for KU's last contest, a 47-7 defeat to then- No. 17 Oklahoma State last Saturday in Lawrence. After that game, Miles and Oklahoma State head coach Mike Gundy shook hands at midfield, with Miles pulling down his mask to speak to Gundy.
   
 "I look forward to beating this virus and returning back to be with my team in person very soon," Miles said in his statement. "Rock Chalk!"

In an interview ahead of a planned birthday celebration Saturday, Martin recalled his experience of the decisive Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive campaign on the western front during WWII.
 Born in Bowling Green on Oct. 10, 1920, Martin grew up on his mother’s farm in Butler County and lived through the heights of the Great Depression. He takes his quirky name – Elmo Lincoln – from the actor best known for his silent film role as the first Tarzan, Martin said.
 Before joining the Army in November 1942, he was an orderly and later staff sergeant in the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, and before that, Martin was “in the moonshine business,” he said.
 Martin married his wife, Ruth Louise Benson, on Dec. 22, 1943, and together they raised four children – Sharon, Linda, James and Richard – before Ruth passed away in 2006. Martin’s worked for most of his, not retiring from a career in sales until after his 88th birthday. At 98 years old, he returned to his roots in Kentucky.
 “I’ve lived a charmed life, I think,” Martin said, adding he feels “grateful” to be celebrating his 100th birthday.
 Still, Martin’s had his share of close calls, especially during his days on WWII battlefields.
 “Anybody who tells you they’re not scared is lying to you. In the beginning, I wasn’t scared, but later on, when a lot of my friends were killed, you’re frightened. Courage is something that you have to call on sometimes,” Martin said of that time in his life. “Some people fail, but you still have the courage to do it.”
 One close call came while Martin’s division, the 99th infantry, was staying near a railway station along the western front. Martin remembers making a cozy makeshift bed for himself beside a window, leaving and then returning, only to find “a shell had blown my little bed to pieces.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A new White House coronavirus aid offer got bad reviews from both ends of the political spectrum on Saturday.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected the most generous Trump administration plan to date as “one step forward, two steps back.” The Republicans who control the Senate dismissed it as too expensive and a political loser for conservatives.
 Pelosi said she is still hopeful that progress can be made toward a deal but it’s as clear as ever that GOP conservatives don’t want a deal on her terms.
 The White House had boosted its offer before Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke on Friday afternoon. President Donald Trump is eager for an agreement before Election Day, even as his most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.
 “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” Trump said Friday on Twitter.
 The new offer totals about $1.8 trillion, aides familiar with it said, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent offer before that was about $1.6 trillion. The aides were not authorized to publicly discuss private negotiations and spoke on condition of anonymity.
 Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.
 In a letter Saturday to colleagues, Pelosi said, “This proposal amounted to one step forward, two steps back. When the president talks about wanting a bigger relief package, his proposal appears to mean that he wants more money at his discretion to grant or withhold.”
 She said that while his administration attempted to address some of the Democratic concerns, disagreement remained on many priorities and Democrats are “awaiting language” on several provisions.
 “Despite these unaddressed concerns, I remain hopeful that yesterday’s developments will move us closer to an agreement on a relief package that addresses the health and economic crisis facing America’s families,” Pelosi’s letter said.
 Mnuchin’s latest offer also got a roasting from GOP senators, who weighed in on a conference call Saturday morning, according to a Republican familiar with the call who was not authorized to discuss the call publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Many conservatives are skeptical of so much deficit- financed aid in the first place, and Pelosi-sought provisions such as expanding eligibility for the Affordable Care Act landed with a thud.
 Pragmatists such as Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and politically endangered Republicans including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina appear willing to “go big” as Trump wants. But rank-and-file Republicans — Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, Rick Scott of Florida, and John Barrasso of Wyoming, for example — are adamantly opposed to another relief bill that’s so generous.
 GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remains skeptical of the chances for an agreement, having told an audience in Kentucky on Friday that he didn’t see a deal coming together before Election Day.
 “I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” McConnell said Friday. He said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to process both a relief bill and the high court nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the Nov. 3 election.
 President Donald Trump has been all over the map, first as one of the forces in favor of a deal, then killing the talks on Tuesday, only to revive them by weeks’ end.
 On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal. Now, after a political beating, Trump is pressing hard for a deal, motivated by the prospect of sending $1,200 direct payments to voters before November.
 It’s clear from Saturday’s Senate GOP conference call that the skepticism or outright opposition hasn’t changed.

Without wanting to sound insensitive to John Legend's and Chrissy Tiegen's situation, I have to say I felt the picture of them holding their deceased infant was wholly inappropriate on a number of levels. And I stress the word "felt" as opposed to "thought".      As others have mentioned, there are probably a lot of counter-arguments to justify the taking and sharing of that picture, many of which I can understand and empathise with. Moreover, far be it from me to tell any parent how they should or shouldn't mourn the loss of their child.      But something "felt" wrong when I saw that picture. Way beneath my cognitive thought processes and lines of rational thinking, a seriously negative emotive response ripped through me when I saw it. I don't know if it was my inner moral compass or my own preconceived ideals, but the feeling was definitely negative, in an empty/disappointed/dismayed kind of way.      I can only speak for myself here, but it seems Social Media has swept people up in such a wave of self-absorption that there's no longer any sense of decorum, privacy, or appropriacy. Anything goes now, including it seems, broadcasting pictures of deceased infants.      I wouldn't wish the hurt that Legend and Tiegen must be going through right now on my worst enemy. The compassionate human in me genuinely feels sorry for them. But you'd have to go a long way to convince me that there wasn't an element of self-absorption at play here, regardless of the pain they were feeling in that moment. And I make that distinction with the greatest will in the world.

In a recent interview, Kurosawa, 65 — no relation to famed director Akira Kurosawa — said he found it hard to understand why Japan’s war crimes remained almost taboo among the country’s filmmakers 75 years after the conflict’s end.
 Other countries make “lots of movies that skillfully talk about the war without ignoring the awful events that occurred,” he said, in a rented Tokyo office space where harried assistants wrangled TV crews and photographers.
 “Wife of a Spy,” he added, is “absolutely not a film that is attempting to brew up controversy or intended to be something scandalous, but you can’t make a movie that tries to make history disappear.”
 Kurosawa was drawn to the war era, he said, because it made an ideal palette for exploring the tension between the needs of individuals and the demands of society. That is a frequent theme in his films, in which characters often find themselves at the mercy of social pressures they can neither understand nor control.
 “In modern times, there is a conflict, a sort of rivalry between society and the individual, but at least on the surface there’s a freedom to do as you like,” he said. But in the war era, the demands to conform “take a shape you can clearly see. You can’t do this. You must do that. You have to wear these kinds of clothes, have this kind of hairstyle.”
 In “Wife of a Spy,” that conflict takes shape in a twisty period drama that owes more to the thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock than to Kurosawa’s own horror oeuvre.

Calling her backyard a rabbit patch is not just hyperbole for a Hutchinson urban farmer. Along with rows and rows of carrots, lettuce and turnip greens, Marilyn Johnson grows beets, tomatoes and lots of chard. There is no grass in her backyard - just vegetables and herbs.
   
 Urban gardeners, like Johnson, are increasing nationwide. They are also on the rise in Kansas.
   
 "We've seen a huge spike in the interest in (gardening) education," said Cary Rivard, fruit and vegetable specialist with Kansas State University Research and Extension Office. "There's a lot of people interested in growing their own garden."
   
 After living in New York City for decades, Johnson, a native of Topeka, decided to come home to Kansas and start an urban garden. Last year, she scoured several counties looking for the perfect backyard. She found it in Hutchinson.
   
 This past spring, Johnson set to work replacing fencing, pulling out grass, enriching her soil and placing water spigots in appropriate locales. She even bought a double sink, a walk-in cooler and lots of yellow and black buckets.
   
 "I could visualize what it was," Johnson said. "When I saw it (her backyard), I knew it was right."
   
 Johnson grew vegetables at a community garden in NYC, but she knew when she came to Kansas she wanted to make farming into a small business. Currently, she sells at the Reno County Farmers Market. Her "extras" get donated to a mission. Because she has not retired, Johnson is hoping to grow her business, which she just started this summer.
   
 "It takes a lot of time," she said. "I come out here and work every day, all day."
   
 Johnson's property of less than 1/16 of an acre can grow an abundance of vegetables. During the early spring and late fall, she erects a caterpillar tunnel - to extend the season. Always careful not to upset her neighbors, Johnson keeps the wired tunnels low. However, she said, her neighbors seem to enjoy what she does. And every once in a while they get a bag of tomatoes or a bunch of kale.
   
 Urban gardens are becoming more popular throughout the U.S. - especially since March and the start of COVID-19. Consumers are either wanting to grow their own produce or know where it is grown.
   
 Research from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., shows that urban farms help with neighborhood safety, economic development and environmental aspects. Usually, the farmers have excess goods, like the 25 pounds of cucumbers Johnson donated to a nonprofit, and help share their resources. In addition, these farmers often create networks and utilize mentors.
   
 Because space is at a premium with these types of gardens, Rivard said urban farmers must plan well. Maximizing space is crucial.
   
 "People need to grow more on a smaller footprint," he said. "It's just that much more critical that your plants grow well."
   
 Johnson said because of her limited growing space, she is continually rethinking what to grow and where to grow it. A former box designer, she is able to create diagrams as to what crop goes where.
   
 "Next year, I'm fine tuning," she said. "I'm getting rid of what didn't sell."
   
 Johnson will change the types of tomatoes she grows, as well as add more okra, kale and cilantro. She encourages others to raise their own vegetables or support those who do.
   
 "I'm sure I'll still be making mistakes and fine-tuning," she said. "You can make your backyard more productive and go sell, can or produce for yourself."

Bowling Green - Donald Lester P'Pool, 79, of Bowling Green, passed away on Tuesday, October 6, 2020, at the Cal Turner Rehab and Specialty Care Nursing Home in Scottsville. A native of Trigg County, he was born on December 16, 1940, the son of the late Waymon Lester P'Pool and Imogene Hite P'Pool. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his brother, Kelly P'Pool, and his sister, Barbara Jean P'Pool.
 Donald was a veteran of the United States Navy (Petty Officer Third Class) and served as a Navy diver completing search and rescue, salvage recovery, and other military support missions. Upon leaving the Navy, he attended college at Austin Peay University and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Industrial Arts and a minor in Business Administration. He owned and operated Modern Mechanical Inc., a commercial contracting company for HVAC and plumbing, for over 30 years. He also spent over 40 years working on his Trigg County crop farm and enjoyed working outside on the land. In his free time he enjoyed traveling and spending time with his family.
 He is survived by his wife of 47 years, Linda Gray (Jackson) P'Pool of Bowling Green; his daughter, Keely Blair P'Pool of Bowling Green; his sister, Betty Jean (Bob) Lester of Cadiz; his sister-in-law, Peggy P'Pool of Cadiz; his sister-in-law, Jeanne Hightower of Terre Haute; his sister-in-law, Barbara (Steve) Levesque of Hopkinsville; his brother-in-law, William (Julia) Jackson of Hopkinsville; his brother-in-law Daniel Paul (DeAnna) Jackson of Clarksville; and several nieces, nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews.

“The kids played well, but Burlington is a good team,” Lynch said. “If we shoot those kind of scores consistently we will win some matches.”
 The Wildcats scores weren’t quite as good in their matches with Watertown last week, but there were some standouts despite the losses.
 Mitchell was once again filling in for Cedrone, who had to miss the match due injury, and he shot a 46 while losing his match 5.5-3.5. The Wildcats did get wins from their three, four and five players on the day, with Dymant shooting a 43 to win her match 5.5-3.5, while Packer won by the same score when he shot a 41 and Vinal rolled to a 7-2 win while shooting a 44.
 The next day at Oakley, Mitchell bounced back by shooting a 42 to earn a 6-3 victory at number one over the same player who had beaten him the day before. For the second day in a row, Vinal won by a 7-2 score from the number five slot.
 It was not enough however, and the Wildcats dropped both matches to get their season off to a tough start. While there were some strong performances, Lynch felt his team had missed a couple of opportunities to pick up wins.
 “I thought we could have fared better against Watertown,” Lynch said. “The past few years we have been pretty evenly matched. I thought we had improved from last season, but it was not meant to be.”
 While there have been some good performances at the top of the lineup, Lynch knows they will need a more consistent effort throughout their lineup if they are going to start picking up some wins.
 “We need some help on the back end of our lineup,” Lynch said. “Somebody has to step up. Until that changes, it could be tough for us to get wins.”

The red planet is big and bright and casting its glow all night long this week. It is just in time for the fall foliage season most of us in the United States and elsewhere in the north are experiencing.      But what would you call the color of Mars?      It's not really "red," but it certainly reflects sunlight in the red end of the spectrum. This may depend somewhat on your eyes and sky conditions, but, to me, it appears more of a golden red-orange to the naked eye.      Mars is currently in one of its closer approaches to the Earth, which you should appreciate while you can. Mars circles the sun about every two Earth years but varies considerably with how near it approaches.      Mars was at its closest point to the Earth on Oct. 6, and will be at opposition with the sun on Oct. 13. That means Mars is directly opposite from the sun in the sky, rising as the sun sets and setting when the sun rises.      In even a small telescope magnifying about 50x to 100x, you can detect Mars as a disc, although it is quite tiny. Still, it is an amazing sight in the eyepiece even if it is so small. You can see the small disc of Mars, likely with faint stars in the background (unless you have a lot of light pollution). Imagine you are in a spacecraft nearing Mars.      If your telescope can handle higher magnifications, and the seeing is good (steady air), you should be able to glimpse dark smudges on the disc and a very small and very white south polar cap.      The "smudges" are referred to as maria, and are fairly permanent markings that you may have seen in photographs. The maria are named and charted on Mars maps. You can even purchase Mars globes, which make for an interesting conversation piece.      The dark features are areas of higher contrast, caused by either darker, basaltic rock or simply where less Martian dust has settled.      The color of Mars in the telescope is striking. The vast Martian deserts are not quite red, perhaps red-orange. To me, it is close to the shade of a peach, more so than a cherry or red apple. Either way, Mars is amazing.      The color is caused by iron oxide chemicals in the dusty soil which resembles rust.      Along with Mars, the colors of autumn can be found in several bright stars visible to the unaided eye and thousands more you can see with a small telescope and a good star map to lead the way.      Perception of color among the stars by our eyes is limited to brighter stars simply because of the way our eyes are structured, at night or in dim light our eyes are less sensitive to color.      The telescope amplifies the brightness, so many more stars are visible that become bright enough to show their shade.      Among red stars, there are red supergiants and red dwarfs. The dwarf stars are very abundant, and none bright enough to see without a telescope.      A couple of wonderful, bright red stars are Antares, well seen on a summer evening, and Betelgeuse, which is most well known as part of Orion, prominent on winter evenings.      Then there is bright yellow-orange Arcturus and bright yellow Capella. You can see these two on opposite sides of the sky as darkness falls in October. Arcturus is in the west, and Capella low in the northwest.      Many more stars are white, or bluish-white.      Early on an October evening, the brilliant star Vega shines with a blue-white light high up in the west; you can also see the bright white stars Deneb and Altair in the west-southwest, and bright white Fomalhaut low in the southeast.      Of course with Mars, we have the planets Jupiter - very bright - and Saturn, a little less bright and to the left, down in the southern sky.      The other morning, I ventured forth onto the deck at around 6 a.m. just in time to make some cats scatter. Looking up, I was delighted to see the very brilliant planet Venus, high in the east, and Mars, which by this time was low in the west. In the southern sky, I had a foretaste of winter but without's winter's cold: there was the wonderful constellation Orion, with the bright red star Betelgeuse, white star Rigel and, to the lower-left the brightest star of the night sky, blue-white Sirius.      The waning gibbous moon was nearly overhead.      Enjoy the colors of the night.      The moon is now a waning crescent, visible in the east after midnight. New moon is on Oct. 16.   Keep looking up at the sky!      Peter Becker is managing editor at The News Eagle in Hawley, Pennsylvania. Notes are welcome at news@neagle.com.
