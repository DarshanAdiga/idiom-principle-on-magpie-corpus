The Mackerel Men initially took the lead in the second half through Reece Meekums and looked the better side for much of the game, but Alfie Young's 85th minute sending off left Worthing with an uphill battle, and Jenks' late goal put paid to any hopes of a victory.

"I felt like I reached rock bottom," she tells Australian Vogue. "It became so unbearable I couldn't breathe and I thought, 'I gotta change'."
 But adopting a healthier lifestyle was more difficult than she imagined.
 "My system was so used to that life it was in shock because I stopped everything," she says. "We are beings of habit and I think you can't just expect to do something you have always done and stop. You have to replace bad habits with good habits."
 She adds, "So when I stopped having coffee, the mocha frappuccino for breakfast and four cigarettes when I woke up in the morning, I started running. I don't run anymore, but I ran then because it allowed me to feel my lungs and every time I ran for 20 minutes I was like, 'OK, I can feel my lungs. OK, I'm not smoking'."
 The 39-year-old, who is now a mum of two, claims meditation helped to get her breathing back on track.
 "I was meditating with breathing techniques so I would not feel anxious," she shares. "(Before that) I would get into the elevator and I would feel like I was going to die. So I replaced bad habits with things that were supporting me and I realized that every day I was feeling better."

And when something bad happens at the college, it’s a bad thing for Chestertown. We are one and the same. We are not separate entities.

The Mackerel Men kept the pressure up as the half wore on, continuing to keep Keto on his toes. Pearce went close again with a powerful free kick from 25 yards, stinging the palms of Keto, before Starkey fired over the bar after some attractive one-touch build-up play to unlock the Brighton defence.
 Brighton found their first good chance of the half through Taylor Richards. The striker made a darting run through the Worthing defence to latch onto a through pass and curled a shot towards the far corner, forcing temporary goalkeeper Jack Fagan into a terrific diving stop.
 Reece Meekums, another ex-Brighton prospect, showed some fantastic skill to beat two men and open up some space, before firing just over the bar from range.
 The half ended all square, but the Mackerel Men had looked the more dangerous side by far. Hinshelwood's men played with a much higher intensity than they had done in recent weeks, and carved out a plethora of promising openings. Brighton began to grow into the game as the half wore on, Richards looking particularly dangerous, but their chances were limited.

Nutrition-wise, she endorses lean proteins like those big bags of frozen scallops and shrimp. "You can take out what you need and put the rest back. Plus, they're already peeled. Just put them in a pot of cold water. Once they're defrosted, you have cooked shrimp ready to use."
 Big batches, whether pulling from them or making them, is clearly a smart idea. Should recycling and trash services be disrupted, we don't want to have a kitchen or garage filled with dozens of sticky, smelly containers.
 Betsy Karetnick, who formerly worked as the "Morning Drive" host for Martha Stewart and is familiar with prepping, cooking, and freezing in large quantities, recommends laying in supplies for soups with hardy produce that lasts: potatoes, beets, carrots, celery. She also mentions that of all the fresh fruits, citrus keeps well in the fridge. "Bananas, like mangoes, can be peeled and frozen for smoothies and baking," she says.
 Baking is an excellent idea for families with children - it's entertainment with an edible end - so add flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, vanilla extract, and eggs to your list. Freeze whatever you don't eat right away.
 If you don't want to bake, preservatives will do the trick. I asked local writer friends, who are easily the best at practicing solitude, what they will buy. Poet Catherine Esposito Prescott says she would go for "those potato rolls that never go bad, and Entenmann's products because they also never expire."
 For fresh herbs, buy them now and make pesto or otherwise puree them with olive oil. I then freeze them in ice cube trays, then release them from the trays and store them in plastic bags that don't take up much room at all.

Jack Fagan was again called into action on the hour mark, making a fantastic stop at his near post to keep out Richards' fierce strike.
 Worthing's first chance of the half came through a rocket from Aguiar. The midfielder picked the ball up 30 yards from goal and let fly, rifling a shot towards the corner and forcing Keto into a fabulous save to tip it round the post.
 The resulting corner saw Worthing take the lead. The corner landed right in the middle of the box and Meekums snatched at the ball, poking it into the back of the net and sending the Worthing fans into raptures.
 The opening goal seemed to kick Brighton into life, with chances for the Seagulls coming thick and fast after this. Just moments after conceding, they almost had an equaliser through Peter Gwargis, whose powerful strike thumped off the bar.

Per questo motivo la Regione ha creato a Tortona il primo ospedale specifico per Covid-19. Si tratta dello stesso nosocomio che è stato interessato in questi giorni da un caso di contagio di Coronavirus, per cui risultano posti in osservazione alcuni sanitari e chiuso il Pronto soccorso. "Una situazione - hanno precisato dalla Regione Piemonte - che ha suggerito all’Unità di crisi di indicarlo come struttura interamente riservata al ricovero di pazienti contagiati dal virus in tutto il Piemonte, rispondendo a quanto era stato espressamente richiesto ieri dal Ministero della Salute. Nei prossimi giorni i pazienti attualmente ricoverati a Tortona verranno gradualmente trasferiti in altre strutture, in modo da consentire l’utilizzo esclusivo di tutti i reparti per l’emergenza".
