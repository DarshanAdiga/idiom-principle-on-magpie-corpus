On paper, the Motorola Edge Plus has everything it needs to compete with the best phones out there right now. The reality, however, is it a little different. Motorola’s first flagship in years offers first-rate performance, clean software (once you get rid of Verizon’s bloatware) and some truly excellent battery life. Unfortunately, the phone’s marquee feature -- its spacious Endless Edge display -- feels like an example of style over substance, and could make the phone difficult for some to use. All told, the Edge Plus gets enough right to make it a competent flagship, but one that can’t might not beat out its competition.

Crisil has revised its growth outlook for India in fiscal 2021 down to 1.8%, from the 3.5% estimated earlier, factoring the nationwide lockdown to stem the Covid-19 pandemic. The forecast assumes the effect of the pandemic subsiding materially in the current quarter, besides a normal monsoon, and minimum fiscal support of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Fiscal support may need to be even increased at the central and state levels to ensure relief reaches, apart from vulnerable households, even vulnerable firms, especially micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). There is also a possibility that parts of the economy will continue to face restrictions beyond May 3, 2020, when the 40-day lockdown would end. Also, a global recession is now guaranteed with deep contraction in advanced countries. S&P; Global has marked down its global GDP forecast to -2.4% in 2020 compared with 0.4% growth earlier. Risks to our India forecast are tilted to the downside, manifestation of which could take GDP growth to even zero. Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, Crisil said in a statement, “We see a permanent loss of ~4% of GDP. Fiscal 2022 is likely to see a V-shaped recovery at over 7% real GDP growth. But even assuming growth sustains at this level for the next three years, real GDP will stay below its pre-Covid-19 trend path.” The lockdown, has started hurting already. In March, for instance, automobile sales contracted 44% on-year even as exports fell 35% with worst yet to come. This deep slowdown and across the board pain leaves large swathes of India’s informal workforce vulnerable, particularly in construction, manufacturing and services sectors. The most affected are daily-wage earners and those with no job security. In India, casual labourers form almost 25% of the workforce and would take the first hit due to shutdowns and layoffs. The situation is bad for the formal workforce, too. A Crisil Research analysis of over 40,000 companies with employee cost of Rs 12 lakh crore indicates that about 52% of the employee cost is incurred by companies in sectors that will see material increase in stress in case of extended lockdown. The sharp deceleration in growth and increased income uncertainty is certain to pull demand down. In the year ahead, we expect consumer discretionary services and products such as airlines, hotels, automobiles and consumer durables to be the worst-hit. Non-pharma exporters, real estate and construction companies also face one of their worst years. Even resilient sectors such as IT services will see muted growth as global budgets on IT spending fall. MSMEs are more vulnerable than larger players, especially on the liquidity front. Our research suggests that even in a relatively milder slowdown than we expect this fiscal, MSME working capital can stretch by over a month. Prasad Koparkar, Senior Director and Head – Growth, Innovation and Excellence Hub, Crisil said, “As India Inc stares at a double-digit slide in revenue this fiscal, the worst in at least a decade, Ebitda is set to fall sharply – by over 15% – in our base case scenario of 1.8% GDP growth. The adverse impact of operating leverage due to sharp revenue decline will drown all the benefits accruing from lower material and energy costs following across-the-board decline in commodities.” Poor credit growth, including retails loans, along with rising NPAs and credit costs will singe banks and NBFCs. We expect banking sector NPAs to rise to 11-11.5% by March 2021 from an estimated at 9.6% as of March 2020, with sharply lower recoveries and rising slippages. NPAs are expected to swell for non-banking finance companies, too, with microfinance, MSME loans and wholesale/developer funding witnessing the sharpest spike. Asset quality deterioration will, however, remain moderate in housing loans and gold finance with less than 50 bps increase in NPAs.

It's about time. After months of leaks and rumors, Intel has pulled back the curtain on its 10th generation "S-series" desktop chips, with the Core i9-10900K leading the pack. For $488, you'll get a 10-core processor that can reach up to 5.3GHz, with a base speed of 4.9GHz. And best of all, it's an _actual_ 10th-gen chip, unlike the confusingly-named X-series processors Intel launched last fall.
 If you're not willing to spend close to $500 on a new CPU, you've also got plenty of cheaper options. The i7-10700 looks like more of a deal, with most of the speed you'll find on the i9 chips, and its unlocked variant might be decently overclockable. This time around, every Core CPU also features hyperthreading -- even the lowly i3 models! --for better multitasking support. At this point, Intel has to throw in as many bells and whistles as it can to compete with AMD's excellent Ryzen 3000 chips -- especially the powerhouse $499 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X.

At this point, Intel has to throw in as many bells and whistles as it can to compete with AMD's excellent Ryzen 3000 chips -- especially the powerhouse $499 12-core Ryzen 9 3900X. While AMD is pushing more cores and better efficiency -- its chips are built on a modern 7nm architecture while Intel is still stuck on 14nm with these "Comet Lake" processors \-- Intel is leaning on higher clock speeds. We learned earlier this month that Intel's upcoming 10th-gen H-series laptop CPUs will also reach 5.3GHz, so that milestone isn't too surprising on the desktop side.And since Intel knows that it has an advantage with clock speed, it's aiming to highlight that wherever possible. The updated Turbo Boost Max 3.0 feature, for example, will identify the two fastest cores on your chip and have them tackle the brunt of your workload. And there's also "Thermal Velocity Boost," a way for i9 processors to eke out a bit more speed when they're under 70 celsius. That's also how Intel is reaching that lofty 5.3GHz figure on a single core, but it'll also deliver slightly higher boost speeds across all cores too. Performance-wise, Intel claims the i9-10900K is 10 percent faster than the last-gen 9900K in PUBG and 63 percent faster than the three-year-old i7-7700K (remember, the i9 chips didn't exist back then). The new processor is also around 18 percent faster at 4K video editing than the last-gen chip, and 35 percent faster than the 7700K. So yah, it's faster -- though as usual, it's probably not worth upgrading if you're on a 9th gen chip. Keeping with the speed theme, Intel is giving enthusiasts even more ways to overclock. There's a redesigned Intel Extreme Tuning Utility, which gives you more control over voltage and frequency. It'll also let you turn off hyperthreading on individual cores -- which might seem counter-intuitive at first, but Intel explains it's a useful way to reduce heat, every overclocker's worst enemy. The new processors also feature a thinner die along with a thicker copper IHS (integrated heat spreader), which should also help keep things cooler. That's a smart move, since all of Intel's new chips still have higher TDPs (thermal design profiles) than AMD's. The 10900K has a 125-watt TDP, for example, while AMD's Ryzen 9 3900X's is just 105-watts. (It's worth noting that TDP is quite a fluid term, though, so we won't know what that 125-watt number translates to in real-world use until we can test a chip for ourselves.)You can expect to see the unlocked "K" CPUs in May, but we don't have a timeline for the other chips. Based on the specs alone, the Intel 10th-gen desktop processors seem like a solid upgrade for anyone with a 3-year old PC. Still, AMD now has the advantage when it comes to core count and architecture efficiency. Maybe next year we'll finally see Intel's desktop CPUs on 10nm, but by then AMD will have an even more refined process. Given just how many waves AMD has been making over the last year, Intel will really have to do something special to stand out in 2021.

Seattle’s testing capacity, however, isn’t where it needs to be yet.
 “There is not adequate testing and I wish I could tell you that that’s gonna happen soon,” Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a virtual town hall last Thursday. “We don’t know when it’s gonna happen.”
 This comes as King County has more than 6,000 confirmed cases and 400 deaths. As it is believed that Seattle has passed the peak of the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the city is still struggling with getting enough testing for its residents to accurately track the virus.
 “We need to be sure to identify people who are showing symptoms and that have the virus to make sure they’re kept away from other people and don’t infect others,” Keith Jerome, who serves as the head of the virology division of UW Medicine, said.
 Jerome believes Seattle is ready for broad-based testing but faces barriers in getting the equipment needed to do so, despite facilities such as the UW virology lab having substantial testing capacity.
 “Right now, there are still issues around supplies of swabs and collection kits,” he said. “Which means we’re not getting as many samples into the lab as we could test.”
 Washington currently has more than 25 labs performing coronavirus testing across the state. Due to capacity constraints and limited supplies, healthcare workers are prioritizing testing those with symptoms and vulnerable groups. The UW virology lab alone has tested just over 83,000 samples, mostly from the Western Washington area. This, however, is nowhere near enough testing for the region to ensure a safe return to normal life.

Speaking of Verizon (which owns Engadget but has no editorial control over us), the Edge Plus supports the carrier's mmWave 5G network. Technically, the phone also plays nice with sub-6 5G networks, too, but since the phone is exclusive to Verizon in the US, that's kind of a moot point. Here's the thing about Verizon's 5G, though: Most people won't find it particularly compelling, at least not right now. I'm not talking about the fact that the carrier's mmWave footprint is minuscule right now, though it is. (I'm not holding my breath to see it in my corner of Brooklyn anytime soon.)
 Perhaps the more notable limitation is that, even with the right phone and the right node around you, you can't experience the full breadth of what mmWave 5G can offer while indoors. Those limitations will eventually fade as Verizon continues to build out its network's reach, but considering everything going on right now, it's unclear how or when that work will continue. I've reached out to Verizon for comment and will update this review if they respond.
 By far, the most reliable thing about the Edge Plus is its whopper of a 5,000mAh battery. These giant cells are growing more common by the week, and even though we're all hunkering down a few feet from a wall outlet, the thrill of breezing through a day and then some on a single charge never really goes away. I typically unplugged the phone between 8 and 9AM, and even with lots of YouTube videos, Telegram calls, email triaging and _Call of Duty_ matches, the Edge Plus always lasted through the night. More often than not, there'd still be enough left in the tank to make it to noon the following day.
 On weekends, when I spent a lot less of my time on those things -- except for maybe _Call of Duty_ -- I could get close to two days of use before recharging the phone. The caveat is that the Edge Plus only supports 15W fast charging, which isn't quite as fast as other phones, but the upside is you won't need to charge everyday anyway. For all its quirks, I'd be tempted to buy an Edge Plus for its battery life alone.

Supervise kids when using hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers have a high alcohol content, often higher than most alcoholic beverages – beer, wine and hard liquor. Although the high percentage of alcohol is necessary to effectively kill germs, these products are safe to use as long as the directions are followed. when following the directions. Hand sanitizer should never replace washing hands with soap and water, as this is always the best line of defense against germs. If using hand sanitizer, make sure the product has more than 60% alcohol to ensure it kills germs. Children should never be allowed to use hand sanitizer without adult supervision as it can be extremely dangerous if they swallow a gulp of gel (more than a lick). Alcohol affects children differently than it does adults – it does not take much to cause serious and potentially irreversible health effects of alcohol poisoning. Keep these products up high and out of sight and reach. Pets are also at risk for alcohol poisoning from ingesting hand sanitizer.

As a survivor of sexual assault myself, I will not be voting for Joe Biden. I will not be voting for Donald Trump. I will not vote for a rapist.
 I was sexually assaulted when I was 15- and 16-years-old. Throughout my teenage years, I’d recount my story to some family and friends and would be asked:Did you say no? Did you like it? Why didn’t you do or say anything?
 These questions always made me doubt my own validity in the struggles that came with recovering from my assaults. I didn’t consider myself a victim for the longest time, and even felt unable to say I was raped, because I was conditioned to feel at fault for the violation of my body. When I felt the pressure was on me rather than the person who abused me, I began to question if I deserved what had happened to me.
 Consistent questioning of my part in my assault turned into ingrained constraints on my voice, hindering my willingness to speak out. If my own friends and family questioned me, who would believe me? So, I suffered in silence.
 It wasn’t until my freshman year at the UW when I was diagnosed by my doctor with severe anxiety that I was able to come to terms with my story and reclaim the validity of my traumas. Upon my doctor’s further questions, it prompted me to connect the dots and explain to someone for the first time in years that I was raped. Saying it aloud and on record was a monumental moment for me.
 Recounting my story has always been tough for me. Placing my moments of trauma into words brings me back to those moments and that specific feeling of remorse in my gut I felt for the me that once existed before he was violated. It’s a complex moment of release but also a frigid reminder of what he had done to me then and to me today.
 This is why I admire survivors who find the strength to share their stories, to uncover the darkest parts of themselves. I am especially inspired by folks like Tara Reade, a woman who is revealing a story about one of the most powerful men in the country.
 When folks come forward and speak out about their abusers, they’re often given the same response that I received. Reade’s allegations against Biden have been denied by both sides of the political spectrum. I read a comment on a podcast Reade had been interviewed on, and it explained its disbelief in her story by asking why she didn’t scream when Biden placed his hands on her. People asked me that too.
 When I was first assaulted at 15, it was in a public space. I could’ve screamed and pushed him away, much like the commenter has suggested to Reade. However, no one truly knows what it feels like to be in such a paralyzed state of shock and disgust when you’re being taken advantage of, especially by someone you thought you could trust, until you’re in that position.
 Reade stated that after she pulled away from the assault, Biden angrily said “you’re nothing to me.” Shortly after, she stated, he then took her by the shoulders and said “you’re OK, you’re fine … you’re OK.”

SINGAPORE -- When the ax fell on Lehman Brothers in 2008, an equity derivatives trader for the U.S. institution became one of many people disillusioned with traditional banking. Seven years later, Nikolay Storonsky launched Revolut, now one of the best-funded fintech companies in Europe.
 Even if you do not believe financial technology startups were a product of the global financial crisis, their growth was undoubtedly fueled by it.
 With the coronavirus crisis, those same elements that spurred a generation of entrepreneurial thinking about financial services one decade ago are present again. If we are lucky, it will help bring about a new era for fintech, a 2.0 version.
 Asia, already a global leader in fintech innovation, is well-placed to ride this shift, especially those companies that survive the crisis.
 No doubt, the health crisis is bad news for fintech companies and startups. Every day brings more news of layoffs, defaults, fall in disbursements or the sucking sound of money leaving the sector.
 In Asia, the great promise of fintech was serving the underserved. Unlike Europe or the U.S., here was a mobile-first population with limited or no access to credit, and in many instances, even a bank account.
 That potential led to a feeding frenzy in recent years, with investors piling into online lending companies in particular. Companies who barely had revenue, let alone a road map to profitability, were being handed outsized sums of money.
 Last year, one young founder in India was dizzy with shock when I interviewed him about his five-month-old fintech company that received $25 million in seed funding from global venture capital firms.
 Even companies who did not start out offering loans, such as Southeast Asian ride-hailing companies Grab and Gojek, saw the potential of getting into financial services.
 That hype is probably done now. If the failed WeWork initial public offering and subsequent meltdown at SoftBank Vision Fund was the coffin for crazy valuations and a "growth-at-all-costs" approach, then COVID-19 is the nail.
 Online lenders offering their services to consumers and small businesses in countries under lockdown cannot physically collect. Many of those customers are not working or unable to work, and loan delinquencies are rising. Regional banks, family offices and local funds, those that provide liquidity for these startups, are pulling back. As one investor told me the other week, now "men will be separated from boys."
 There are exceptions, especially for startups not in the lending space. But for the majority of founders in Asia who have never experienced an economic downturn, this is a "make-or-break" moment.
 Those that survive will probably become bigger and stronger than before. This is a good thing because they are essential for enterprises and consumers who remain overlooked or excluded by bigger banks. Even during coronavirus, startups are doing their best to support this segment.
 And yes, it is great that companies from Grab to Revolut to small startups in rural Indonesia are providing options for underserved customers or those who feel big banks are letting them down. Overall, however, success for the fintech sector will not be based on one or two big technology companies.
 Which makes the secondary effect of the current crisis even more important: a heightened awareness of how interdependent our financial system has become since 2009, thanks to technology.
 Even more crucially, it comes as the elements that created the perfect cauldron for fintech to blossom in the era after the global financial crisis -- changing consumer behavior, an opportunity to innovate, and new regulation -- are present again.
 Central banks and other financial authorities were already experimenting and deploying new digital infrastructure to regulate financial services.
 Consider the Bank for International Settlements, which late last year launched the BIS Innovation Hub Centre in Singapore. The move -- the first expansion of BIS' global footprint in 17 years -- was aimed at fostering greater collaboration among the central banking community globally.
 Another example is India's Unified Payment Interface. The UPI movement not only simplified the digital payment process in the country of 1.4 billion, it also boosted many startups and technology companies.
 Hopefully, the coronavirus pandemic provides wind in the sails for these initiatives. Asia is home to some of the world's biggest financial services disrupters, which have had a transformative effect on society. If governments and organizations can channel that same innovation on a larger scale and with greater cooperation, the region will trailblaze fintech "2.0" as well.

Through an online presentation, Intel has unveiled its most powerful 10th Gen desktop processor -- the Intel Core i9-10900K with up to 5.3GHz CPU clock speed. This is a 10-core 20-thread processor with an emphasis on single-core performance, as most of the games still depend on the single- core CPU performance.Intel Core i9-10900K SpecificationsThe processor uses Thermal Velocity Boost technology to achieve 5.3GHz clock speed and also supports Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. The CPU does support overclocking and comes with new overclocking knobs to support per-core HT enabling/disabling and enhanced frequency or voltage control curve.The new Intel Extreme Tuning Utility software offers graphical enhancements and has an option to stress test and benchmark the CPU. It does showcase various parameters like core, cache, graphics, and memory in real-time.Compared to the previous generation S-series processor, the Intel Core i9-10900K comes with thin die solder thermal interface material (STIM) that helps with the heat dissipation as it now comes with a thick integrated heat spreader (IHS).The Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 will identify two best performing cores to increase the overall performance of the computer without increasing the voltage, which keeps the thermal in check.ProcessorIntel Core i9-10900KBase Clock Speed3.7GHzBoost Clock Speed5.3GHzNumber Of Cores10 CoresNumber Of Threads20 ThreadsTDP125WNumber Of PCIe 3 LanesUp To 40Memory SupportDual- Channel DDR4-2933Built-in GPUIntel UHD Graphics 630Price488 US DollarsIntel Core i9-10900K Real-World PerformanceThe Intel Core i9-10900K offers up to 33 percent more fps on Mount Blade II when compared to the Intel Core i9-9900K and on PUBG there is at least 10 percent more performance.

Church then moved into private practice, where she was able to deal with financial viability as an issue firsthand, an experience she thinks will prove useful as Hall Health faces changes to its financial model.
 Her interest in teaching led her to the UW, where she worked as associate director of the Family Medical Residency Program prior to joining Hall Health. Church has also continued serving as a primary care physician, in addition to researching and teaching at the UW.
 “I have always been interested in student health, even way back when,” Church said. “It’s different to look at how I partner with students in an administrative way but I’m looking forward to that.”
 In addition to the recommendations provided by the Hall Health Task Force, Hall Health has been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
 Under Dugdale’s leadership, Hall Health shifted toward telemedicine, conducting medical visits through video conferencing between patients and doctors.
 “We also had to develop, from scratch, protocols for having patient visits for people who might have COVID-19 or have symptoms that would fit in that domain,” Dugdale said. “We had to develop new ways to evaluate and treat them safely.”
 As Church assumes this position, she proceeds with an understanding of the challenges created by the pandemic.
 “I think that people are very interested, very eager to move into the recovery phase,” Church said. “But the fact is we are still seeing COVID cases.”
 Church and Dugdale have been working together as they navigate this leadership transition and the changes being made to Hall Health amid a global pandemic.
 “Dr. Church and I speak every day as we try to plan for an orderly transition,” Dugdale said. “We continue to work in every way possible to provide the best healthcare value for the student body.”
