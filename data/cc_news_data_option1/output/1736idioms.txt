VIRUS OUTBREAK-GEORGIA TESTINGGeorgia deploys 3D printers, Guard units in testing scrambleAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Volunteers at a Georgia dental college who started using a 3D printer to make nasal swabs used in test kits for the coronavirus are now a major part of the state's effort to expand testing. Dr. Jeffrey James says his crew at Augusta University began by printing 300 swabs a day. Now at the urging of state officials, they're working around the clock to produce 5,000 swabs daily. It's an example of how Georgia is scrambling to increase testing for the virus after Gov. Brian Kemp has lifted a shelter-at-home order for most people and reopened many businesses. There are some signs of improvement. Georgia had administered 84,300 tests as of April 20. That number is now more than 174,000.ELECTION 2020-SENATE-GEORGIATop Georgia Democrats running for US Senate spar in debateATLANTA (AP) — Two of the top Georgia Democrats vying to take on Republican Sen. David Perdue in November took hard swipes at each other during a virtual debate Sunday evening. Criticism of the state government’s coronavirus response otherwise took center stage. Former Columbus mayor Teresa Tomlinson and former congressional candidate Jon Ossoff sparred over name recognition and polling numbers. Also running in the June 9th Democratic primary are 2018 candidate for lieutenant governor Sarah Riggs Amico, former ACLU of Georgia head Maya Dillard Smith, Air Force veteran James Knox and Marckeith DeJesus. The debate was held by online video conference with candidates joining from their homes because of the virus.AP-US-MARTIN-LUTHER- KING'S-TRAFFIC-STOPMartin Luther King's traffic ticket changed history's courseDECATUR, Ga. (AP) — On this day 60 years ago, a black man driving a white woman was pulled over in a traffic stop that would change the course of American history. That man was Martin Luther King Jr., and his misdemeanor citation on May 4, 1960, led to him being sentenced, illegally, to a chain gang. Georgia’s segregationist politicians sought to silence King before he could mobilize great masses of people. But it backfired when John F. Kennedy got involved, days before the 1960 presidential election. Black voters switched from Republican to Democrat in huge numbers, hastening the end of race laws across the South.VIRUS OUTBREAK-GEORGIAAtlanta area malls reopen after virus restrictions easedATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta region’s largest malls have started reopening as restrictions enacted in Georgia because of the coronavirus have been eased.

Lenox Square in Buckhead reopens Monday. The owners are requiring workers to take safety precautions, such as wearing masks.

Bourdon said people are baffled and angry by the decision.NATIONAL GUARD-NEW PLANESSavannah unit is candidate for new National Guard planesSAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Members of Georgia's congressional delegation are urging the Pentagon to choose a Savannah unit to be among the first in the Air National Guard to receive new C-130J transport planes. Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, along with GOP Rep. Buddy Carter, sent a letter Friday to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett. The lawmakers say the 165th Airlift Wing based in Savannah is ideally suited to be the first Air National Guard unit to transition to the new aircraft. The Air National Guard in March identified the Savannah Air Guard Station among eight locations it’s considering for the new plane.VIRTUAL ROAD RACEGeorgia 5k race goes 'virtual' to thwart virus concernsBRUNSWICK, Ga.
