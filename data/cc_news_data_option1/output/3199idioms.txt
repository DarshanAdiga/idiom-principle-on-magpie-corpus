To this point, we haven't really been affected by a lot of airline bankruptcies or aircraft retirements when the airlines are announcing their downsizing their fleets. So, those are the types of things that could potentially trigger an impairment in the future, if there is a bankruptcy or restructuring, we don't have the type of aircraft in our fleets that the airlines are generally retiring. So, I don't see that being a risk, but it's just -- it's going to depend largely -- it's aircraft specific, and therefore very lessee specific. So, it will depend on what level of restructuring and bankruptcies we see down the road.

Delving deeper into your gray matter as you exercise reveals exciting news about the growth of new neurons, and the development of stronger connections between them. This is because physical activity promotes the production of three complex but essential growth factors that reduce inflammation, grow new blood vessels and halt the self-destruction of cells. Your regular exercise routine can also have a beneficial impact on memory, by awakening dormant stem cells in the hippocampus. There’s really nothing dumb-blonde about being a gym bunny!

The Cape is experiencing a far different year for mosquito-related diseases compared with last summer.
 State lab results for this week's testing of mosquito samples taken from the Cape continue to show no infections of Eastern equine encephalitis or West Nile virus, according to Gabrielle Sakolsky, entomologist and superintendent of the Cape Cod Mosquito Control Project.
 "By this time last year, we had five positive samples for EEE in Falmouth and one positive sample in Truro for West Nile virus," Sakolsky said.
 And testing has been considerably expanded this summer.
 "We have sent in 478 samples," she said. "Last year at this point we had sent about 320."
 The ongoing drought has contributed to keeping the number of mosquitoes down.
 "The swamps are very dry right now," Sakolsky said. The dry conditions "definitely have reduced the habitat for development."
 "The places where I see the most water are where people are watering their lawns, and the water runs down the road and into drains," she said. Street drains are a frequent habitat for mosquito larvae.
 Close attention is being paid to the section of Bourne bordering Wareham. Mosquitoes infected with Eastern equine encephalitis were found in Wareham earlier this month, Sakolsky said.
 The results of weekly sampling are announced by the state on Thursday mornings.
 The risk level for Eastern equine encephalitis is at high or critical risk in eight communities statewide this season.
 Mosquito samples infected with the virus have been detected in Franklin, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Worcester counties.
 There has been one human case of the virus so far this year, in a male under 18 in Plymouth County.
 The state Department of Public Health, the Department of Agricultural Resources and the State Reclamation and Mosquito Control Board are conducting aerial spraying to knock down the mosquito populations in specific areas of Plymouth County and a small part of Bristol County.
 Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages.
 Initial symptoms include high fever, stiff neck, headache and lack of energy. Symptoms occur three to 10 days after a bite from an infected mosquito.
 Inflammation and swelling of the brain are the most dangerous and serious complications. Patients may go into a coma within a week of symptoms.
 The most recent outbreak of EEE was last summer, when there were 12 human cases and six deaths, according to the Department of Public Health website. Before that, the most recent outbreak years were in 2004-06 and 2010-12.
 There were 22 human cases of infection during those two outbreak periods, with 14 occurring among residents of Bristol and Plymouth counties.
 There has never been a recorded case of human EEE infection on Cape Cod.
 So far this season, West Nile virus has been detected in mosquito samples in some communities off-Cape. The only human case of that virus has been in a man in his 50s who was likely exposed in southwestern Essex County or eastern Middlesex County, according to the Department of Public Health.
 West Nile is considered less serious than Eastern equine encephalitis, with 80% of the cases in humans symptom-free, according to the department. Symptoms can be flulike and include headache, fever and vomiting.
 According to the department's website, less than 1% of people infected with West Nile will develop severe illness, including encephalitis or meningitis.

Chronic inflammation contributes to skin sensitivity, redness, and irritation. It also promotes premature skin aging. When exposed to a triggering stimulus, skin cells produce inflammatory hormones known as cytokines and chemokines. These hormones can cause vasodilation or activate nerve cells. They also trigger immune cells to migrate to the skin, where they produce even more inflammatory hormones, free radicals, and chemicals, all of which can cause further damage.

The business continues to show its openness to executives having multiple roles, even if it's not always clear which gig is their "A" job and which is their side hustle, if you will. Want to take a high-level label position and still find outside fulfillment as a manager or producer? Not every company has a cavalier attitude about letting top employees potentially divide their attention. But for a multitude of reasons, a "carve-out" in a contract that allows a key hire to keep pursuing an outside position is a common allowance.

Shortly after saying he’d explore a new deal for Lindsay this offseason, general manager John Elway signed Gordon to a two-year, $16 million deal in free agency.
 “The fact that we have two running backs now that can be very explosive with the ball in their hands whether you throw it or run it, I think is a good thing,” new offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said in June. “I really do think you need more than one running back.”
 How Gordon and Lindsay will divvy the carries has been a hot topic among Broncos fans all offseason, but Lindsay has no insight to add to the debate.
 “I wish I could let you know and tell you now. I don’t know,” Lindsay said. “At the end of the day, that’s not my job to sit there and put me or Melvin in the game. That’s their job. If they don’t want to have one of their game- changers and playmakers in the game, that’s on them. I don’t get paid to sit there and call the plays. That’s not my job.

ENGLEWOOD — When Englewood Elementary School’s administration heard that St. David’s Episcopal Church wanted to make masks for the school, they thought it would be for teachers and staff members, numbering about 89 people.
 Then they found out the church intended to make masks for all the students as well — and that number is much larger. On Aug. 5, the coordinators of "Project Mask-R-Aid" delivered 838 colorful, kid-friendly masks to appreciative teachers, administrative and support staff, along with principal Mark Grossenbacher.
 For “Project Mask-R-Aid,” 17 members of the Episcopal Church Women and Daughters of the King organizations at St. David’s volunteered their time and sewing talents. Beginning June 30, they vowed to have the masks ready for every student, teacher and staff member to wear at the start of the new school year in August.
 It took a lot of collaboration and planning to coordinate 17 people working on different parts of the masks and in different locations — but the job was completed in just six weeks.
 “It was a wonderful thing to be part of,” said Deacon Micki Thomas, one of the coordinators of the project. “Everyone had a great sense of community and accomplishment as part of this effort.”
 The brightly colored masks were made in four different, adjustable sizes to accommodate the many different size kids at the K-5 school, plus all the adults. Special 100% pre-washed cotton was used for comfort and maximum protection, and to prevent shrinkage.
 Wildly varied patterns were chosen to appeal to kids of all ages and their interests — jigsaw puzzles, polka dots, birthday candles and balloons, animals, musical instruments, art supplies, and more. Some are in the green and white colors of the school.
 If more masks are needed down the road, St. David’s seamstresses will try to find fabric with eagle designs, the school’s mascot, according to Debra Sigismondo, another coordinator of the project.
 The Englewood Elementary School masks even came with a blessing. At St. David’s Aug. 2 streaming church service, the Rev. Vickie McDonald gave God’s blessing to the masks, with online viewers joining in prayer.
 While the Mask-R-Aid ladies are grateful their masks may contribute to the success of a new school year, principal Mark Grossenbacher, his teachers and staff may be most grateful of all to receive them.
 “We couldn’t be more thankful for these masks," he said. "They are amazing, and the fact that they were made with love for very student and staff member makes us thankful each day we wear them. We are a Community of Caring at Englewood Elementary School and are so grateful to have St. David’s Church as a member of our caring community.”

The announcement of this year’s game is the first officially by Troy to replace a game for the upcoming season. The Trojans have lost four non Sun Belt Conference games off its original schedule because of either a team electing not to play this season or having a conference schedule update cancel the date with Troy. Those teams are Arkansas Pine Bluff (Sept. 5), UMass (Sept. 12), NC State (Sept. 19) and Tennessee (Nov. 21).
 Middle Tennessee State’s athletic director Chris Massaro indicated last week that Troy was in discussions with the Blue Raiders about playing two games, one Sept. 19 in Murfreesboro, Tenn., the other on Nov. 21 in Troy. However, no official announcement has been made, though the two games are already listed on the MTSU football website.

A generation of classical music lovers remembers vividly what pianist David Deveau accomplished as artistic director of the Rockport Chamber Music Festival.
 When he assumed the position in 1995, RCMF held a month's worth of concerts every summer in a reconditioned barn.
 When he left 22 years later, Rockport Music held year-round concerts, in the spectacular Shalin Liu Performance Center. Besides bringing artists like Yo-Yo Ma, Midori, Peter Serkin, Charles Rosen, Jennifer Koh, Leon Fleisher, and Joshua Bell to RCMF audiences, Deveau inspired the ambitious planning and fundraising that resulted in the tens of millions of dollars necessary to build a world-renowned concert hall.
 The performance center is shuttered now through February, a casualty of the pandemic. But the long-term health of Rockport Music remains stable, and for that Deveau is thankful.
 "I would have hated to see what I had built start to crumble," he says. "When I left, I felt that it was time for new blood, and I have not looked back. I do miss all the human interaction, and creating the programs. That was a labor of love."
 Deveau until now has remained at his position as lecturer in music at MIT. That too will change, with his retirement in January.
 "I've taught 32 years," he says. "I loved my work the entire time, and I will miss my good students. I never thought I would retire from teaching."
 But the pandemic, and recent health issues, have changed his mind.
 "I went through radiation at Brigham last fall for eight weeks, every day," he says. "It went fine, but the cumulative side effects were unpleasant. And I started thinking about small issues--like the rest of my life.
 "Then teaching after the shutdown turned out to be unbearably unpleasant. Online, it was so challenging to get any kind of nuance. It all depended on bandwidth and internet freezes.
 "People deal with the shutdown differently. This enforced sabbatical has turned me inward," he says, "looking at why we went into this crazy field in the first place. I realized I hadn't really had the opportunity to do anything except career stuff."
 So Deveau is leaving MIT, selling his southern New Hampshire home, and moving this month to Nevada, where he has family.
 This is no shuffleboard retirement. Deveau has a fall recording session planned, pairing Schubert with a new work by Elena Ruehr. He hopes to create a private studio in his new home, sharing insights from his German Steinway C. And he will perform--"if someone asks, and I'm interested in the project"-- when concerts return. But it's no longer the priority.
 "A lot of performers a making videos, and doing this or that online," he says. "I've used this time as reflection on life, and where my priorities are. Honestly, to be fulfilling and satisfying, it does not necessarily include public concerts.
 "I don't want to sound all Glenn Gould-ish," he says, referring to the pianist who left off performing mid-career, "but I've really changed my outlook on how I want to have my music reach the public.
 "I used to hate recordings, until I realized the process was like making a movie. With retakes, you can leave it all on the floor and patch it together. Before that, I had always tried to record like it was a concert - everything in long takes."
 Even with recording projects in the works, there's plenty of solitude for exploring the repertory. Like Bach.
 "Being alone, you realize that you can practice anything," he says, "for your own heart and soul, and growth as an artist. For me it means renewing my Bach study.
 "I want to play a lot of Bach, and not ultimately in public," he says. "For me it's much more like studying the workings of a Swiss clock. It's perfection. There's no other composer like him. That is how I want to spend my golden years."

This year has been a year of reflection for me. I love traveling, and my job, so it's been difficult to stay still. But since I’m not able to travel outward, I have journeyed inward. The pandemic has forced me to slow down, and has allowed me to reflect on my life, and where I want to go next. I started meditating more. I sign myself up for classes, to learn new perspectives. I am trying to focus on being more conscious of things, including my health. I've been eating well, and exercising; I lost thirty pounds in the last five months. I didn't consider myself overweight before, but I do feel healthier, leaner, fitter, and better about my health overall. I've spent more time reading, and working on myself, including my mind. I have always been fascinated with hypnosis, and how to tap into the subconscious mind, so I took a course on it, and am now a certified hypnotherapist. Not that I have any plans, on changing careers, but I wanted to learn more about it, and finally had the time. I've spent more time playing my guitar, as well as reading. I remember reading somewhere, if you come out of this Pandemic, and haven't done anything you never lacked time — you lacked discipline. It hasn't been easy. There are days where I have felt completely depressed at not being able to see friends, or hug people I love, or make movies. On those days I try to not judge myself, and I take it easy. But if you allow yourself too many of those days that becomes your routine. So, it's important not to get stuck.

The Camp Wildcat Preservation Foundation recently hosted descendants of a soldier who fought and died at Laurel County’s Camp Wildcat Civil at Battlefield.
 It was a warm sunny morning on August 7, at Camp Wildcat as Chip McFerran and his son Michael from Alexandria, Indiana made their way along the Hoosier Knob Trail accompanied by members of the Camp Wildcat Preservation Foundation. As they made their way up the steep slope toward Hoosier Knob they stopped approximately 500 feet from the crest of the hill. The remnants of the old Union earthworks are located there, just out of sight.
 Chip McFerran felt goosebumps rise on the back of his neck.

MONTPELIER – According to an announcement from the Scott administration, enough funding has been guaranteed through state allocations and grants to complete the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail (LVRT).
 On Wednesday, a press release from Gov. Phil Scott’s office announced the state’s legislature had approved the $2.8 million allocation proposed by Scott for finishing LVRT, an allocation Scott’s office said would be able to leverage another $11.3 million in federal funds for the trail’s completion.
 The wider LVRT, maintained through a state contract by the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers (VAST), stretches across much of the northern half of Vermont, with the final trail expected to span from trailheads in Franklin County to a terminus in St. Johnsbury in Vermont’s east.
 Several struts have been completed in Franklin County, including the Richard “Dick” Thompson Fit and Healthy Recreation Path in Swanton and a larger completed stretch in Sheldon. The trail also intersects Franklin County’s own Missisquoi Valley Rail Trail near Sheldon Junction.
 The Scott administration has previously championed the trail as both an economic tool for drawing hikers to Vermont’s more rural corners and a means for improving Vermonters’ quality of life in communities connected through the trail.
 Scott echoed those sentiments himself in his office’s statement Wednesday, writing the completed trail “will bring together some of our most rural communities while boosting local economies and improving quality of life for Vermonters and visitors.”
 “I appreciate the cooperation of the legislature, our federal and local partners and VAST in getting us a step closer to making this long-time goal a reality,” the governor said.
 According to Scott’s statement, work is currently ongoing this summer to complete a stretch of the rail trail in Hardwick supported through private donations, Agency of Transportation-administered federal funds, the Northern Borders Regional Commission and an allocation from the Town of Hardwick itself.
 Currently, 33 miles of trail have been finished with another 60 miles still awaiting construction.
 Unfinished lengths of the trail include stretches of former railroad paths in the Franklin County towns of Bakersfield, Fairfield, Fletcher, Highgate, Sheldon and Swanton.
 The trail would ultimately wind through Lamoille County before reaching into the Northeast Kingdom and ending at its easternmost trailhead in St. Johnsbury.
 With additional state funding guaranteeing access to federal funds, VAST and the Scott administration are now projecting the trail’s construction to likely be finished by 2022.
 Upon completion, the LVRT would be the longest rail trail in New England.

FILE - In this Sept. 8, 2019, file photo, New York Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams looks on before an NFL football game against the Buffalo Bills, in East Rutherford, N.J. Gregg Williams has made a career of adjusting on the fly, mixing and matching players to regularly field one of the NFL’s toughest defenses. The New York Jets defensive coordinator certainly has his hands full this season after losing his two best players with Jamal Adams traded, and C.J. Mosley choosing to opt out because of the coronavirus pandemic. But, in typical fashion, Williams isn’t sweating it - at all. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File)

Last season, Mosley missed all but two games in his first year with the Jets because of a groin/core muscle injury. Fellow middle linebacker Avery Williamson was sidelined the entire season with a torn knee ligament. That forced Williams to give backups such as Neville Hewitt, James Burgess and Blake Cashman lots of valuable playing time.
 Those players will be among those counted on again this season to replace Mosley.
 “C.J. didn’t have a bunch of on-field time last year, but he did a great job behind the scenes and a great job in the meetings, and he will continue when that thing is right,” Williams said. “But he has to do what he has to do, and family is first — make sure we understand that. I talk to the guys all the time about your biological family first, and then this is the second family.”
 The restrictions NFL teams faced in the offseason because of the pandemic limited in-person interaction, but Williams said the players on defense really got to know each other — and the fundamentals of the system — through extensive video calls.

WELLFLEET -- Ryan Bailey and his family have vacationed in Wellfleet for 13 years. For three years running, the oversand-vehicle enthusiasts have been unable to access the corridors on the Cape Cod National Seashore during their vacation week. The corridors were completely closed two of those years, and in another year, only one-eighth of a mile was open to permit-holders.
 This year Bailey was so frustrated that he started an online petition for more access to the Seashore. "It's time for the National Seashore to ... allow ORV access again so we all can continue to make great memories with our families on those beautiful beaches," he wrote in the petition.
 The petition, which he posted July 27, had garnered 315 signatures as of Thursday. When he reaches 350 signatures, Bailey wants to print out the file and send it to Seashore Superintendent Brian Carlstrom "to start the conversation."
 "We're not looking to take over the place," Bailey, who lives in Western Massachusetts, said. "We want to institute something like they have at Nauset Beach."
 The closures are due to several factors, according to Carlstrom, who oversees the 43,000-acre park. Travel on the beach corridors is restricted to April 15 to Nov. 15, and further restrictions based on beach conditions and shorebird nesting activity could reduce access to well below the total 8 miles available. As of Wednesday, 2 miles were open.
 "Conditions change daily, and we have rangers monitoring areas several times during the day," Carlstrom said.
 He said several factors make accessibility a complex issue. Nesting shorebirds can close a beach section. Tide cycles can change the shoreline. A storm can change the beach and render areas inaccessible.
 Bailey believes the Seashore is using the shorebirds as an excuse to keep the corridors closed. He is not alone in that assessment. Victoria Attanasio, of Truro, and her family have been oversand enthusiasts for 17 years. Attanasio believes Seashore officials are not being transparent with shorebird information.
 After six weeks of total closure of the corridors last year, and three weeks this year, she asked for data on four years of nesting shorebird activity from the Seashore. She was told she had to file a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Park Service. The Park Service has 20 business days to respond.
 The Seashore is home to several endangered or threatened species or species of special concern. But it is the piping plover, a threatened species that is protected under the Endangered Species Act, that is the bane of the oversand community. Seashore staff members are the primary resource managers of the park, and it is their job to protect the birds.
 "We work within the parameters we have for their recovery," Carlstrom said. "The letter of the law requires us to do it. We're the primary resource stewards of the National Park Service."
 Bailey would like to see the Seashore establish a habitat conservation plan like the one in place at Nauset Beach in Orleans. It allows access to stretches of the beach during certain times, with rules instituted for the safety of nesting shorebirds. One of those rules requires escorts for oversand vehicles in areas where shorebirds are nesting.
 "The Seashore is in a difficult position," said Bob Long, president of the Massachusetts Beach Buggy Association. "They don't have the resources available to towns, and they have a whole set of guidelines they must follow."
 Long wants more access to the Seashore beaches as much as anyone. He knows that oversand vehicle owners will always be outnumbered by those who don't want vehicles on the beach. But he thinks public education and awareness can go a long way to convince people that opening the beaches is a good thing.
 "We are for the protection of species and the conservation of resources," he said. "However, we're also trying to protect the traditional and historic uses that cause no harm."
 It's that traditional use, written into the legislation that created the Seashore in 1961, that Gail Cohen believes is in danger of being lost. The longtime beach activist and former Provincetown resident believes the corridor should be open year-round.
 "It should always be open because that was the way of life on Cape Cod when the Seashore came in," she said.
 The National Park Service promised all kinds of things during hearings held from 1958 to 1961, Cohen said. One of those things was the need to preserve local traditional and historical ways of life on Cape Cod.
 Long agrees. "Traditional and historic uses were written into the legislation," he said. "The problem has been that it depends on who was in a position of authority as to what direction the park went.
 "We think there's a compromise that can work for all of us," he said. "What's refreshing about Brian Carlstrom is that he's indicating there is room here."

Where Gordon has an edge over Lindsay is as a pass-catcher out of the backfield. Gordon has averaged 45 catches for 375 yards and totaled 11 TD receptions in his career.
 Lindsay has caught 35 passes in each of his two seasons, with one going for a touchdown. His average yards per catch dipped from 6.9 to 5.6 last year as he dealt with the lingering effects of wrist surgery.
 Lindsay said those numbers will rise in 2020.
 “Pass catching-wise, I feel really good. I feel like I’m back to myself,” Lindsay said, adding that rebounding from his wrist injury “was tougher than I thought. ... But this year I feel good. I feel good and at the end of the day I’m going to catch every ball that comes my way.”
