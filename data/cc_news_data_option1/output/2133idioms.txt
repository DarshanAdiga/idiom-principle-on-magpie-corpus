  The father-son duo used to pick a quarrel under the influence of alcohol. Divakar went home under the influence of alcohol on Saturday midnight. He kept on knocking the door and Murugan, who was also drunk, allegedly refused to open the door. Divakar picked a quarrel with Murugan when he opened the door sometime later.


  As the quarrel continued, Divakar picked up a sharp needle like object and stabbed his father. The man succumbed to injuries on the spot.


  Though the accused attempted to convince relatives and neighbours that his father died of accidental fall, they grew suspicious and informed Selvapuram police.


  When questioned, Divakar confessed to the crime. He was arrested on Monday morning and remanded in judicial custody.

Britain, which with over 38,500 dead has the world’s second-worst death toll behind the United States, eased restrictions despite warnings from health officials that the risk of spreading COVID-19 was still too great. Some elementary classes reopened in England and people could now have limited contact with family and friends, but only outdoors and with social distancing.


  In Asia, Bangladesh restarted bus, train, ferry and flight services Monday, hoping that a gradual reopening revives an economy in which millions have become jobless. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters clogged Manila as the Philippines tried to kickstart its economy.


  Around 6.19 million infections have been reported worldwide, with over 372,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many died without ever being tested.


  In the U.S., the often-violent protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer, are raising fears of new outbreaks in a country that has more confirmed infections and deaths than any other.


  The U.S. has seen nearly 1.8 million infections and over 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care.

"That's just bogus," said Denny Behrens of the Grand Junction-based Colorado Stop the Wolf Coalition.
 The group's website lists 39 counties where commissioners have signed resolutions opposing wolves, which were eliminated from Colorado in the 1940s. In the spring, Stop the Wolf Coalition conducted its own survey, finding only 40% supported the return of the predator.
 That was done over the phone, Behrens said, through an independent contractor.
 "Online surveys are about as big a joke as there could be," he said.
 Authors of the CSU study granted that "because we used an online survey platform, it is possible that our sample may be biased towards individuals with high technology awareness."
 They cited past research, including a 1994 mail survey that found urban Coloradans "were more supportive and positive toward wolf reintroduction than those in the predominately rural areas west of the continental divide." In a 2010 phone survey, 53% of ranchers in three western states were opposed to wolves in their vicinity.
 Since enough signatures were collected to get Initiative 107 on the ballot, a polarizing debate has spread across Colorado. As the CSU researchers describe: "To some, the reintroduction of wolves symbolizes a chance to make amends with wilderness, while, for others, wolves are seen as a threat to livestock, hunted ungulate populations, and rural livelihoods."

Bloomberg) -- In the first day of higher gasoline prices in Venezuela, it's hard to say who's more confused. The attendants at the pump? Or the drivers.


  The good news is that there's visibly more gasoline being pumped from fuel stations in the capital Caracas than in the previous weeks and months. The bad news is that lines are still miles-long and if you're lucky enough to get to the front, many stations are facing problems accepting bank card transactions or scanning special cards meant for subsidies.


  "I've been here since 4 a.m, and hope to fill with subsidized gasoline," said Marcos Rojas, an engineer at a station in Southeastern Caracas. He was the first in line at 7 a.m. and the station, secured by police and the pro- government militia, hadn't opened.


  The manager was waiting for instructions from state-run energy company PDVSA on how to work the different payment methods. "I haven't received any information from them and I have over 200 drivers waiting in line," he said, asking for anonymity out of fears of reprisal.


  In a nearby closed station, lines extended for over a mile, spilling into a highway. Supply was promised for later when military personnel in charge of the area authorized it. Adding to the agglomerations is the fact that Venezuela's coronavirus quarantine is being relaxed for the first time in several months on Monday.


  In stations where people were able to fill up and pay, some walked into convenience stores to use the card machines while others paid in cash, at times with dollar bills.


  The decision by President Nicolas Maduro to raise fuel prices starting this week represents a historic policy shift after decades of heavy subsidies that has meant gasoline has esssentially been free for Venezuelans for decades. Now, due to crippling U.S. sanctions and gross mismanagement of the domestic energy industry including refineries, fuel is in short supply and the country is depending on shipment from ally Iran to boost inventories.


  As part of the plan, gasoline will be sold at two prices. For people signed up for a government subsidy program called the Fatherland Card which is linked to a biometric payment system, it will cost 5,000 bolivars (2.5 U.S. cents) per liter for about 120 liters (30 gallons) per month per vehicle. And for everyone else, gasoline stations will charge the equivalent of 50 U.S. cents a liter.


  "It's rough, but what can I do? I'll have to start including gas in my family budget," said 44-year-old Maria Fernanda, as she waited in line to fill her tank at a premium gas station. "I went to the regulated one but left, because the system keeps dropping and people couldn't pay. Here it's expensive, but at least it's not as much as in the black market."

The event took place two days after the historic NASA-SpaceX launch that sent Behnken and Hurley to the station and one day after they docked and were welcomed aboard by Cassidy and Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner.


  This mission, called Demo-2, served as a way to test out Endeavour so more NASA astronauts can travel to the space station by launching from US soil for varied lengths of time.


  Cassidy watched the spacecraft approach from the space station's cupola, "amazed at the whole thing and realizing what was happening," as both the spacecraft and space station docked while traveling 17,000 miles per hour.


  Cassidy said that his new crewmates have already hit the ground running on day one, and soon, they'll be working on science experiments together. "The three of us are pretty excited to get after it together."


  Cassidy, Behnken and Hurley are veteran astronauts. Behnken and Hurley both had two shuttle missions each under their belts ahead of the Demo-2 launch Saturday. Cassidy previously flew a space shuttle mission and had a six-month stint on the space station in 2013 ahead of his current stay on the station, which began in April.


  "This was an extremely long road for Bob and I," Hurley said. "We last flew in 2010 and 2011. NASA stopped flying shuttles in the middle of 2011. It took hard work and dedication the last nine years to get us where we are now, launching rockets from the US. It's been a really rough couple of months, so to be able to show the country what the agency is made of, what Commercial Crew and SpaceX did, I hope they take some pride and sense of accomplishment from that."


  Upon arriving on the space station, Hurley and Behnken "captured the flag." The flag was left on the space station during NASA's final shuttle mission, STS-135, which included Hurley, with the intention that it would be captured by the next crew to launch from the US.


  "Chris had it right on the hatch right where we left it nine years ago," Hurley said, holding the flag.


  Cassidy placed a note on the flag that said, "Do not forget to take with Crew Dragon."


  Depending on how long Behnken and Hurley stay on the space station, which could be anywhere between one to four months, "you can bet we will take it with us when we depart back to Earth," Hurley said.

Protests over Floyd’s death have shaken the U.S. from New York to Los Angeles. Demonstrators are packed cheek by jowl, many without masks, many shouting or singing. The virus itself is dispersed by microscopic droplets in the air when people cough, sneeze, talk or sing.


  “There’s no question that when you put hundreds or thousands of people together in close proximity, when we have got this virus all over the streets … it’s not healthy,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said.


  Some efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus are being upended by the protests. In contact tracing, newly infected people list everyone they’ve interacted with over several days in order to alert them that they may have been exposed. That may be a daunting task if someone has been to a mass gathering.


  The process also relies on something that may suddenly be in especially short supply: Trust in government.

“I’m sure most of the guys have been taking precaution. I ain’t been going anywhere but the gym and the crib,” Allen said. “Honestly, I’m just thankful to be able to go when we’re supposed to because I know some schools that aren’t. I think they’ll do what needs to be done to keep us safe.”


  Douglass said it’s comforting to know Nebraska is following Big Ten guidelines “by the book.”


  Still, none of this is ideal. There’s no clear path to what these volunteer workouts could lead to. There’s no guarantee college sports happen in the fall, and it’s unclear, after the student-athletes return to campus, when they’ll be able to leave to go back home to see family.


  The silver lining for Webster is it feels like progress. And for the men’s basketball team specifically, with so many new players, it’ll be nice to be around teammates instead of in a barn in the middle of Indiana.


  “I think it’ll definitely help with chemistry, even if we aren’t allowed to practice with 10 guys,” Webster said. “I think being in an apartment or wherever we’re staying and just being around each other helps cohesiveness and chemistry. You get to know everyone.”


  It is at least a start to the process of heading toward normal, a small slice of life taken and now returned.

Because of the volume of resources and safety measures, the concern among those inside NU in past weeks has been to get student-athletes spread around the globe back under the NU umbrella.


  “The safest place for our student-athletes is Lincoln, Nebraska, and the safest place in Lincoln is to be in our facilities,” Moos said.


  There are between 150 and 175 student-athletes already on campus, Moos said. Move-in dates for athletes this week appear to differentiate among teams. The volleyball team is already mostly in town, a spokesperson said, but the rest will be in by this week. Men’s basketball players are expected to be in Lincoln by June 6 at the latest. Football players have been given dates as early as June 2 and as late as June 22 for move in.


  Webster is going to load up his car and drive the nine hours west from Indianapolis with his parents this week. He was supposed to move into an apartment with three other teammates. Instead, he’ll be living alone for the time being.


  After everyone is tested and cleared, the workouts begin, which will be the next hurdle because the conditioning disparity could be vast. Though football coach Scott Frost said this spring he expected most of his players to return in shape, a study released this week by the NCAA showed about 80% of the more than 37,000 student-athletes surveyed were hindered in their ability to work out because of local regulations and lack of access to appropriate facilities.


  Across the country, gyms were shut down. In some states, outdoor parks were even restricted.


  So athletes have had to get creative.


  “Since quarantine started and the gyms closed, me and my family built a home gym in our third garage stall. You have to be a little creative sometimes,” said Douglass, an incoming freshman on the football team. “As hard as you try, you can’t recreate the type of atmosphere a real weight room has when your teammates are pushing themselves and each other to the max.”


  Athletes sometimes are lucky enough to have a gym opened or gain access to a football field. Locally, Allen said he’s been dropping by a local gym twice a day about four times a week. There, he meets up with some other players for drills.

A long line of masked visitors snaked outside the Vatican Museums, which include the Sistine Chapel, as they reopened for the first time in three months. Italy is eager to reboot its tourism industry, which accounts for 13% of its economy.


  The Vatican Museums’ famous keyholder — the “clavigero” who holds the keys to all the galleries on a big ring on his wrist — opened the gate in a sign both symbolic and literal that the Museums were back in business.


  Still, strict crowd control measures were in place at both landmarks: visitors needed reservations to visit, their temperatures were taken before entering and masks were mandatory.


  “Having the opportunity to see the museums by making a booking and not having to wait in line for three hours is an opportunity,” said visitor Stefano Dicozzi.

Indian equity benchmarks gained strong ground on Monday, with the Sensex surging over 1,000 points in intraday trading as investor sentiment received a boost with the government easing lockdown restrictions. The positive trend in Asian markets acted as a catalyst.
 The 30-share Sensex gained 879.42 points, or 2.71%, to close at 33,303.52. Earlier in the day, it gained 1,250 points to touch a high of 33,673.83.
 The broader Nifty settled the day at 9,826.15, up 245.85 points, or 2.57%.
 Market participants attributed the rally to a combination of domestic and global factors, even as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country continues to rise significantly on a daily basis.
 According to Aamar Deo Singh, head, Advisory, Angel Broking, the markets surged on the back of a positive trend in the Asian markets and the Indian government relaxing curbs on most economic activities even as the lockdown in containment zones has been extended till June 30. “The rally was broad based, with advances outnumbering declines by 15:1 in CNX Nifty 500. Overall, sustaining above the current levels is very crucial for a move towards the 10,000 mark in Nifty, in the near future,” added Mr. Singh.
 On the BSE, close to 1,900 stocks ended the day in the green as against about 600 stocks that declined.
 Among the Sensex pack, stocks such as Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, HDFC, TCS, Bajaj Finance, Hindustan Unilever, State Bank of India and ICICI Bank contributed the most to the day’s gains.
 As many as 25 stocks in the Sensex pack gained on Monday, while stocks such as L&T, Hero Motocorp and Nestle India, among others, lost ground.
