NEW YORK (AP) — Walmart is launching a new membership service that it hopes can compete with Amazon Prime. Called Walmart+, it will cost $98 a year, or $12.95 a month, and give members same-day delivery on 160,000 items, a fuel discount at certain gas stations and a chance to check out at Walmart stores without having to wait at a register. Walmart has a long way to go to catch up with Amazon Prime. Launched in 2005, Prime has more than 150 million members worldwide who pay $119 a year, or $12.99 a month, for faster shipping and other perks, such as discounts at Amazon’s Whole Foods supermarkets and access to its video streaming site. Walmart’s online sales are growing rapidly, especially during the pandemic, when more people have turned to the company to order groceries online and pick them up at a store. But the world’s biggest retailer is still a distant second online to Amazon. Walmart is expected to take 6% of all online sales in the U.S. this year, compared to Amazon’s 38%, according to market research firm eMarketer. Last week, Walmart emerged as a possible suitor for the U.S. business of TikTok, the fast-growing video app with more than 100 million users. Analysts have said the bid with tech company Microsoft could be a way for Walmart to grow its online shopping business and connect with millions of young shoppers. Janey Whiteside, Walmart’s chief customer officer, said it wasn’t launching Walmart+ to compete with any other shopping membership.“We’re launching it to meet the needs of our customers,” she said. “And it really was designed to make their busy lives easier.”Walmart+ members will still have to spend at least $35 online to qualify for free shipping. But delivery could be as quick as the same day for groceries, toys and household items, such as toilet paper and soap. Members will get a discount of up to 5 cents a gallon at Murphy gas stations or at the 2,000 Walmart locations that have gas pumps. The company said it’s working to add more gas-station chains to its list. At its stores, members can unlock an app to scan items as they shop and pay without having to stop at a cashier. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said Walmart+ will launch Sept. 15.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

When it comes to problems, there is nearly always a human involved somewhere. But were they really the cause or just the final part of an inevitable chain of events? Many managers often stop at the human, leading to a blame culture. This toxic culture not only distracts from the bigger picture, but it also causes people to close ranks, storing up the risk for the future.

As if divinely orchestrated, when I first began my health and wellness journey a myriad of plant-based people came into my path. I started working as a host at Chili’s during college, and so many people I met within a 4-year span were either vegetarian, pescatarian, or vegan. I didn’t even know what a vegetarian was! I had never met one and this wasn’t a prevalent way of life within the black community. Even my mother still thinks I’m health-deficient from not eating meat, but she thinks my vegan recipe pictures are pretty and healthy. These people became not only my greatest sources of inspiration, but great friends as well. Long days and nights were spent cooking, learning new recipes, trying new ingredients. We all faced the same setbacks with unhealthy cravings, overeating, finding options while eating out — but we grew together in the process. All in all, every friend who has ever spent time either eating my cooking, or cooking with me is a major factor in my success.

Kitson even helped one client create a mini-parkour, or obstacle course, that their two young boys can use for fun, physical breaks from their school day. For daily exercise, these brothers will skip to a doorway, jump up to ring a bell, then use a 2-by-4 installed in the hallway as a balance beam. Hopping off of it, they'll crawl through nylon hoops, then climb over the back of a slip-covered sofa and crawl back to their school desks.

By the way, in my experiences, about 93% of people have put up an energetic “wall” around their heart. This means that you probably do have a Heart-Wall. Ask yourself, if I have a Heart-Wall, what is it doing to me? What is it doing my relationships and what kind of an effect is it having on my love life?
