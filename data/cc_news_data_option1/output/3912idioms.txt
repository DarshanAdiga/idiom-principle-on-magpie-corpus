Another comforting lie is that fundamental investing is the only way to go. This appeals to most people because through their formative lives they have been in touch with some aspect of fundamentals (schools, colleges, reading etc). It also, more importantly, appeals to the rational side of everyone -- we always want to know the ‘reason’ of why we should act in a certain way. No one ever comes across technical analysis in their formative lives.

Aitken hopes to build on his squad by this weekend’s final pre-season clash on Saturday – yet to be confirmed – with two more players close to joining.
 “These things always take time, we don’t want to jump the gun, but we’re hoping by next Saturday we have another couple of players on board,” he added.
 “That’s the time-scale that we’re looking at, and it might happen earlier.
 “It might happen in the middle part of the week, but certainly by next Saturday’s game, which will be our last pre-season game, we should have another one or two over the line.”

If Intercontinental's strategy in financial exchanges is any indication (it is!), then observers should expect the company to transform the mortgage market into a tradable exchange where it can generate revenue through transactions (trades) and monetize the data. This is a massive opportunity that is just plain ambitious. Should the company pull this off and become a major player in the mortgage origination and lending market, it will result in huge financial gains.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) share are down around -2.03% in Tuesday market trading with stock price surged as much as 1.0% to hit day high of $101.78, before returning a portion of loss to finally trade around $99.17 in the red before the closing bell in New York. The average transaction volume for ICE over the past month (3234720 shares per day) is trailing its average daily volume over the past year by -7.47, which suggests market participants have been less active in this stock of late.

It would be an overstatement to claim that Gillispie’s dinette contains a hidden message. Fleetwood’s conversations with him, which took place after his wrongful conviction was overturned after two decades, suggest that he was motivated by nostalgia and perhaps longing for the freedom that Route 66 represents in the American mythos. However the work also expresses the conditions of its making, especially since those conditions were so fraught. At any time, Gillispie could have been punished with weeks or months of solitary confinement for his illicit artistic efforts, which took place outside the carefully-controlled conditions of state-condoned “hobbycraft”. The dinette evinces his undeniable dedication and the generosity of the informal community that supported him. Most movingly, the sculpture evokes the movement of time behind bars: the temporal torture so easily ignored by those who haven’t served, including prosecutors and jurors.

Police found 30 tons of hashish on the yachts in addition to 5 tons previously seized elsewhere. Police said they arrested nine Bulgarians and one Russian and confiscated six yachts worth an estimated 5 million euros, or $5.9 million.

If ever there was a film to banish the blues, it’s La La Land. Writer/director Damien Chazelle’s toe-tapping follow-up to the Oscar-winning Whiplash sees him trade the abusive relationship between a hot-headed mentor and an aspiring drummer for the high and low notes of a love affair, played out against the backdrop of Tinseltown itself. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play antagonists- turned-lovers Mia and Sebastian – she’s a barista and jobbing actress; he’s a pianist eager to open a jazz club – with them both suffering countless setbacks as they strive to make it big. It may not have won the best picture Oscar – but it is guaranteed to make your heart soar.

She teams up with Bridesmaids director Paul Feig for this story about a desk-bound CIA employee who is thrust into dangerous fieldwork when her partner is killed and many more active agents are put at risk. What follows is a truly hilarious take on a Mission: Impossible- style action flick, with McCarthy on top form as well as Jason Statham in a brilliantly utilised supporting role.
