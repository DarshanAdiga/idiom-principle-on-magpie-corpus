If you're a Sudbury Wolves fan and need motivation to avoid large groups, practise social distancing or good hand-washing habits, think about a first round playoff matchup with the Hamilton Bulldogs.
 That's what awaits if the playoffs ever happen.
 There's obviously no guarantee we'll get there, but every time we take the precautions our civic, provincial and national leaders are advocating to help "flatten the curve," we're perhaps a smidgeon closer to hockey returning.
 It will clearly take more than my actions or yours, but ours do matter.
 So be diligent for overagers Macauley Carson, David Levin and Brad Chenier, who will sadly see their OHL careers fizzle out if the effects of COVID-19 wipe out the playoffs along with the regular season, which has officially been cancelled by the Ontario Hockey League.
 Or do it for the guarantee to see Quinton Byfield suit up in a Wolves jersey for at least a few more games, knowing it's possible the NHL team that drafts him this summer won't send him back to Sudbury in the fall.
 While it's hard not to focus on the sad stories, there is a positive one that definitely deserves our attention. Put an asterisk beside it if you wish, but when the OHL announced the rest of the regular season was cancelled -- 56 games in total and five for Sudbury -- it meant the Wolves were officially Central Division champions for the first time since Mike Smith was the team's goalie 19 years ago.
 Yes, they accomplish it in a slightly shortened season, but the Wolves were six points ahead of Barrie with five games to go, so the odds were pretty favourable. Sudbury even had the advantage on Barrie for the tiebreaker due to more wins, if it got to that point.
 Besides, a championship is a championship, and they've clearly been hard to come by for the Wolves as a franchise.
 Predicting what will happen or when we might know whether the playoffs will proceed or not is next impossible at this point. The landscape in our province, country and around the globe has changed so dramatically on a day to day basis in the last week that it would only be a guess.
 But until the OHL makes an official announcement, a fan base can dream a little, can't it?
 The first-round matchup with Hamilton would be intriguing to say the least. Remember that this is the same Bulldogs team that escaped the Sudbury Community Arena with two points back in November thanks to an 11-10 overtime victory. The only other matchup was a 7-3 Wolves win in Hamilton, meaning Sudbury actually won the season series with a 1-0-1-0 record, good for three points. The Bulldogs were 1-1-0-0, collecting just two points.
 Had the regular season been completed, the Wolves were supposed to play the Bulldogs in two of their final five games -- scheduled for March 15 in Hamilton and the season finale in Sudbury on March 20. The regular season was supposed to wrap up this weekend, which probably speaks to the timing of the decision.
 The Bulldogs may be the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, but they're a team that can score, as that 11-10 game suggests. Arthur Kaliyev was about to eclipse 100 points and had an outside shot at scoring 50 goals before the regular season was scrubbed.
 There's also Czech-born Jan Mysak, who arrived back in January and had 15 goals in 22 OHL games.
 This will not be, or would not have been, a cakewalk for the home side.
 Along with the individual storylines, the Wolves as a team seemed to be coming together as they returned to health before the league was shut down. If North America can get the coronavirus under control and we get to see playoff hockey at some point this spring, or summer, a healthy and rested Wolves team would be a significant threat in the East.
 Like everything else, hockey takes a back seat to people's health. Political leaders and sports leagues have made the choices they had to make to keep us safe, particularly the most vulnerable in our society.
 But hockey does bring happy thoughts in challenging times.
 While I'm not qualified to assess whether we'll get there -- if we do -- I'm predicting Sudbury wins the series in five games, but it will be closer than that sounds. Here's hoping the Wolves get a chance to live up to that, and the Bulldogs have an opportunity to prove me wrong.

Big changes are happening at SeaSpine Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:SPNE), which makes the stock worth watching today. The company is among the top losers of the stock market today, sinking -17.85% or (-1.36 points) to $6.26 from its previous close of $7.62. Does this decline mean it the best stock to buy right now? The shares seem to have an active trading volume day with a reported 95851 contracts so far this session. SPNE shares had a relatively better volume day versus average trading capacity of 215.55 thousand shares, but with a 23.76 million float and a -35.8% run over a week, it's definitely worth keeping an eye on. The one year price forecast for SPNE stock indicates that the average analyst price target is $20.5 per share. This means the stock has a potential increase of 227.48% from where the SPNE share price has been trading recently.

The Israel Winner Basketball League suspended the 2019/20 campaign indefinitely as of Tuesday due to the coronavirus with no date set for its return to action. The league office issued a statement to explain their decision to not out a date as to when the league would go back to regular operations.
 "Due to the worldwide coronavirus epidemic, in the face of clear instructions from the Ministry of Health that prevent full games and training, and after consultation with senior officials of the Ministry of Sports, Ministry of Health and others, the basketball Premier League is forced to announce the suspension of basketball Premier League activities starting Monday.
 We will continue to keep up to date with all relevant factors and keep up to date with developments as the desire and intent of all of us is to continue the league and reach a sporting end. We wish all the players, coaches, those in the industry, and all of the basketball and sports fans good health, and a quick return to full activities."
 League Chairman Shmuel Frankel added: "It's a sad day for Israeli sports in general and for Israeli basketball in particular. I hope we all return to the courts soon. Wishing everyone a lot of health."
 The league's decision to not end the season or set a date of return would allow the foreign players a chance to go home to be with their families during this challenging time throughout the world. In addition, there are many financial issues that will need to be solved with the league not playing any games. That includes revenue streams from the television contract, sponsorships and ticket sales while players' contracted salaries would also need to be paid out.
 The player compensation also falls into a number of categories because there are both Israeli and import players with domestic players able to receive various benefits that foreigners don't including furlough while receiving unemployment insurance. That wouldn't play a factor for the foreigners as they can't take advantage of that option.
 Some leagues, including Belgium, have decided to end their season early leaving many players in the lurch and not being compensated for the duration of their contract or certain deals being worked out on an individual basis.
 Other leagues have set re-evaluation dates like in Spain where the ACB suspended operations until at least April 24th with the hope that they would be able to continue the campaign sooner rather than later. The down side for those players in Spain is that a team like Barcelona has not allowed its foreigners to leave the country and are stuck frozen in place for the time being.
 Italy has set a date of April 3, but it's very hard to believe that the situation will be much better by then that the league could continue. Milan players are still in Italy and are receiving their salaries.
 Another difficulty in making a decision on a domestic league level is that the European leagues are still in play.
 The Euroleague, which features Israel's Maccabi Tel Aviv, has stated that it won't begin play again before April 11 and once again this seems to be a very optimistic date.
 Hapoel Jerusalem features in the FIBA's Basketball Champions League, which hasn't set any date for a potential return to play, leaving those teams also hanging in the air. The BCL also has issues of their own due to the fact that only six of eight round-of-16 playoffs series concluded, with two best-of- three tilts tied at 1-1.
 There's plenty of challenges facing not only the Israeli league, but all of the domestic leagues across Europe as well as the continental competitions. Many teams won't be able to weather this financial storm and may go bankrupt, go down a division or two and cease operations. Local governments will be stretched to the maximum and financial backing of sports will not be one the list of priorities.
 As time goes by, the issues will begin to become clearer and solutions will be found. However, was the Winner League's decision to not make a decision the correct one and will basketball life around Europe go back to normal? During uncertain and trying times that remains to be seen.

    China on Tuesday send a cargo plane carrying 15 tons of material to Myanmar to help the country reopen its garment factories, which have been shut due to a shortage of supply from China because of the coronavirus epidemic, according to media reports on Wednesday.      The move was just the start of a plan by the Chinese government to resume exports of supplies, not just for the garment factories but also other manufacturers and to support the country's economy and employment, the People's Daily newspaper reported, citing a Chinese diplomat in Myanmar.      "Although the cost of transportation is relatively high, it saves businesses and jobs and restores supply chains. It shows the strong friendship between China and Myanmar," Tan Shufu, commercial counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, told the People's Daily.      Although Myanmar has not reported any confirmed coronavirus cases, disruption of supplies from China due to the epidemic and efforts to contain it have caused closure of many factories in the country and staff layoffs, according to the report. For the garment industry, as many as 400 companies face a shortage of supply.      As China undergoes an industrial upgrade and domestic wages rise, many companies, including Chinese ones, have shifted some of their production to countries in Southeast Asia, including Myanmar. However, as the epidemic has shown, many of these countries still depend heavily on supplies and even workers from China to continue operation.      Apart from the garment industry, many other sectors, including electronics, shoes and handbags, also rely on raw materials from China, according to the People's Daily.      Global Times

It happened in the most unconventional and unprecedented of ways, but the Sudbury Wolves have clinched their first division title since 2001.
 The OHL announced on Wednesday that the remainder of its regular season would be cancelled, due to the ongoing threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, effectively freezing the standings as they were when the season was suspended last week.
 The status of playoffs and the Memorial Cup national championship has yet to be determined.
 The OHL announced its decision following a conference call involving league governors and similar announcements by the Canada's other two major-junior leagues, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League and the Western Hockey League.
 "In the interest of the safety of our players, officials, staff, fans and the general public, it's been agreed that the cancellation of the remainder of the 2019-20 regular season is the proper course of action to take at this time," OHL commissioner David Branch said in a release. "We are continuing to monitor ongoing public health developments regarding COVID-19. When it is safe and we may resume play, we will advise on the status of the 2020 OHL playoffs. We thank OHL players and their families, fans and partners for their continued patience and understanding throughout this challenging situation."
 If playoffs do go ahead, the Wolves, seeded second in the Eastern Conference with a record of 34-27-1-1, will face the seventh-place Hamilton Bulldogs, at 24-30-7-1.
 The teams split their regular-season series, with Sudbury taking a 7-3 decision in Hamilton on Nov. 9 and the Bulldogs winning a wild 11-10 overtime thriller in the Nickel City on Nov. 17.
 The Wolves were to meet Hamilton in two of their final three regular-season contests, prior to Wednesday's cancellation.
 "I think it's the right decision during these times," said Rob Papineau, Sudbury's vice-president of hockey operations and general manager. "In some respects, we have to consider ourselves extremely fortunate, because we really did get the vast majority of our regular season completed, so from that perspective, we'll count our blessings and moving forward, we're all really hoping that everybody does their part to help slow down and stop this virus. If that's done, we look forward to the opportunity to pursue the next chapter, hopefully, of the playoffs."
 City staff have taken the ice out of Sudbury Community Arena for the time being, but will need only five days to reinstall it when action resumes.
 The Wolves will have a chance to hang a division banner in that arena next season for just the third time in franchise history, but Papineau wasn't ready to celebrate that achievement as of Wednesday.
 "It's one of those things that get a little bit overshadowed by the realities of the world," Sudbury's GM said. "Once everything sort of normalizes in society and in the world, we'll shift our attention to other things, but right now, we're just worried about all of the people in our community and in the world and making sure that everyone is as safe as they can be."
 The league also announced that the OHL Priority Selection will go ahead as planned on April 4, beginning at 9 a.m.
 Sudbury has the 11th-overall pick in the draft. The North Bay Battalion draft first overall, the Niagara IceDogs second, Sarnia Sting third and Soo Greyhounds fourth.
 The draft has long been conducted online, rather than as a live event, though teams typically gather their scouting, management and coaching staffs. Depending on the public health situation at that time, gathering such a large group may not be advisable, given the importance of social isolation in curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
 "We're waiting for some more information from the company that supports the league and the teams through that whole process in a normal year," Papineau said. "They'll obviously make all the adjustments necessary so that if there is some need to continue to be remote at that time, we'll be able to deal with it. We have full confidence in the people in the league office and in their relationships in dealing with the people who support us from a technology standpoint, but at this point, we're just waiting for a little more information.
 "These kids who have played all year and really did get their regular seasons in and for most of them, all of their playoffs, this is something they have been working toward their whole life, and during this tough time, it will hopefully give them something to stay positive about and to look forward to."
 As for the players on the Wolves' current roster, Papineau is well aware that many hope to solidify their NHL draft status or earn pro contracts with a solid post-season performance, and would love to see them get that chance.
 "Our players are so committed to the game and to our team and to the city, so for sure, we would love to have that opportunity for them. At this time, as we have all very quickly gotten used to, you have to take everything day by day, sometimes hour by hour, and at the end of the day, we're not looking too far ahead, but we're making sure we have all the plans in place for whatever comes our way next.
 "Through this time, on behalf of the team and all of the people involved with the Sudbury Wolves, we just want to let all of the people in our city and everywhere else know to just stay safe and we'll all get through this together."

When 4-year-old Kailey Robertson recently had surgery at CarolinaEast Medical Center she became the first pediatric patient to wear one of the children's surgical caps made by hospital staff and volunteers.
   
 Certified registered nurse anesthetist Stephanie Pinero came up with the idea for the kids' caps to brighten the day of patients seen by her husband, Eric Pinero, also a CRNA at CarolinaEast.
   
 "They're going to surgery," Stephanie Pinero said. "It's a stressful event. Maybe this is something that will just help -- something little. Kids love little things."
   
 Her initial plan to make a few caps eventually expanded to plans for caps for all pediatric surgical patients at CarolinaEast.
   
 "So, I went and got him some fabric and made a cap," she said. "I have a sewing machine, so I just kind of whipped one up and it turned into this."
   
 That first surgical cap, based on an Internet pattern and made from fabric purchased by Pinero at Hobby Lobby, grew to about 100 with the help of CarolinaEast volunteers like Barbara Lewis and fabric donated by community members.
   
 "Once we decided to expand it, I needed more hats than I could physically make having two kids at home," Pinero said.
   
 The caps feature characters from movies like the Avengers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, as well as dinosaurs, princesses and ballerinas.
   
 "I have a 12-week-old little girl and a 23-month-old son," Pinero said. "Having kids, I kind of knew what they would be drawn to."
   
 Children scheduled for surgery can pick their caps from a basket in the pre-op area of the hospital, she said.
   
 "It kind of makes them think less about the surgery and more about something that makes them happy," Pinero said. "From the parents' perspective, it shows we're going above and beyond trying to help the child go through this difficult process."
   
 Danielle and Michael Robertson of Greenville, Kailey's parents, thanked Pinero and the volunteers who created the caps, including the one with a princess design that Kailey wore.
   
 "I know that it made her feel like an extra special little princess and it definitely helped her feel more at ease," Danielle Robertson said.
   
 The surgery, to remove a drain from previous ear surgery and replace stitches, was Kailey's third.
   
 Michael Robertson said the hospital got in touch with him and Danielle several times prior to Kailey's surgery to let them know what to expect.
   
 "The first two times you could tell she was a little skeptical about the whole thing and kind of worried as to what to expect and what was going on," he said. "The third time, it just seemed a lot smoother. She had something to look forward to and she wasn't so anxious regarding it."
   
 Michael said he met Pinero and Lewis at the hospital.
   
 "They are awesome ladies," he said.
   
 Danielle said she and Michael can't thank them enough.
   
 "They are beyond awesome people," she said.
   
 Pinero said many of the first 100 surgical caps have already been used by CarolinaEast pediatric patients, so more caps are in the works.
   
 "We've picked up the number of pediatric cases that we do," she said. "We could probably go through 20 a week."
   
 That number could jump to 60 or 80 a week if the surgical cap project is expanded to the CarolinaEast Surgery Center, where many children have dental surgery or ear, nose and throat surgeries such as implanting tubes to help treat ear infections, Pinero said.
   
 "We would like to thank everybody who has donated fabric in the community," she said. "Little things go a big way."

In the Fast Lane: States with the Most Speeding Tickets

As officials ask young, healthy, possibly virus-carrying Italians to stay put, thinking not only of themselves but of those who may get contaminated, many assert their freedom of movement, their need for contact. The infamous and at times reckless Italian disregard for rules becomes disrespect for others, leading to a rapid spread of cases and the highest percentage of deaths. Italians to give up _aperitivo_? At first no, but now more people are showing small signs of anxiety even in their defiance.
 Will the U.S. go through a similar cycle of incredulity, anxiety, semi- compliance, _dolce far niente_ (sweet doing nothing), before going back to _aperitivo_? Sure, Italy is not the U.S., but the now-ubiquitous curve reveals the effectiveness of being quarantined (from _quaranta_ , 40, the days traditionally associated with the self- or state-imposed isolation).
 Being without contact, having to give up the cheerfulness of kissing each other every time you greet an Italian, leads to lessons about the importance of presence, human touch, human voice, shared laughter and tears (weddings and funerals are banned). The South of Italy is always more cheerful than the North: residents in Naples have inspired others to sing from windows, in unison across balconies, as the substitute of the practice of bumping each other’s arm, “Are you listening? I am here.”
 For all the talk about online classrooms and virtual conferences, my Italian friends and families, as well as Wake Forest students, lamented the lack of togetherness even before schools were closing. _Il dolce far niente_ is a lifestyle, but forced social distancing is hard. As #stareacasa trends on social media, Italians reflect on the values of staying at home, but contact and class are not equal.
 Just like in the U.S., my friends remind me that not all pupils have access to online learning, not all retired parents have relatives or Amazon to deliver groceries, health care access varies greatly. The lesson about contact and class is to treasure the time together, not just for family and friends, but for those who are “out” of touch, out of sight, others.

Technical chart claims that AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (AB) would settle between $20.29/share to $21.76/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $17.74 mark, then the market for AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $16.66 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -5.61. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

She loves the character Shanaynay. She made up that name with 'Mc' bc her last name is McDermott. She was reenacting the over the top fun and amazing character from Martin. She is innocent and didn't mean anything by it."

She’s also an avid theater goer. She lives in the heart of Times Square and goes to the theater about once a week, but when Broadway and many other entertainments canceled, cut back seating or postponed performances last week, Milam knew exactly how she’d fill the extra time.
 “I’m happy snug on my couch. I’ll do my best to make the most of that,” she said.
 Many concert tours, awards shows, festivals, museums, sporting events and more have shut down to help “flatten the curve” as the virus spreads around the globe. Bans on big and medium-size gatherings are proliferating, prompting more people to hunker down at home.
 “We’re catching up on our reading. I just started ‘Love in the Time of Cholera.’ It seemed appropriate,” said Beverly Pfeiffer in Silver Spring, Maryland, of the Gabriel Garcia Marquez classic that plays out amid an outbreak of the disease.
 Other people are working more, especially now that they’re doing it from home. Some have upped their kitchen game by taking on fussy recipes and baking projects.
 One company that offers online courses has seen a huge jump in business, as has another that sells digital photo scanning services.

 Toys, building blocks and games are scattered about Cool Spring Clubhouse Drop-In Learning Center in downtown Fayetteville.
   
 St. Patrick's Day decorations, family pictures and colorful posters dot the walls, including one that reads, "The promises of God are still true! God is bigger than the coronavirus."
   
 The only thing missing Wednesday morning were the children.
   
 Tiffany Martinez, who owns the center, said she made the difficult decision Wednesday to close the business for the time being because of concerns about the coronavirus.
   
 "Honestly, it wasn't beneficial for me to stay open," Martinez said.
   
 "People were making appointments and canceling," she said. "I tried to stay open and support them, but I think it was doing more harm than good."
   
 Throughout the area, child care centers are dealing with the effects of the coronavirus. Some said they had seen an increase in phone calls asking about their services; others said customers are canceling because they are staying home with their children while school is out during the outbreak.
   
 Leslie Brown, who works at Ms. Carolyn's Child Care Center on Cumberland Creek Drive, said the business was operating at about half-capacity Wednesday.
   
 "We have quite a few teachers out (because of the schools closure), so they've kept theirs out; those children aren't coming in," Brown said. "People have asked about bringing their school-age children in, but we're not taking new referrals now."
   
 At Burns Day Care and Pre-School on Bordeaux Park Drive, assistant director Gloria Campbell said most of the calls have come from parents wondering if the center was still open.
   
 "We haven't really changed very much," Campbell said. "We're basically going by what Gov. (Roy) Cooper says."
   
 Briana Jackson, owner of Little Moments Child Care and Learning Center, said hers is an unlicensed center and that she is allowed to take care of only two children full time. But she can take care of more children on a part-time basis.
   
 While she hasn't had anyone cancel yet, Jackson said one of her clients is a mom worried that she is going to get laid off and not be able to afford child care.
   
 "She doesn't know how they're going to handle it," Jackson said.
   
 Martinez, whose Christian-based center is in the Self-Help building downtown, said she watched as calls dwindled and reservations were canceled over concerns about the coronavirus.
   
 The situation got worse over the weekend.
   
 "Friday and Saturday, it was like a ghost town," Martinez said. "Those are usually our busiest times."
   
 Martinez said some parents would drop their children off for a couple of hours for weekend "date nights." On a good day, 40 to 50 children would be at the center throughout the day, she said.
   
 Martinez said she can take care of as many as 25 children at a time. The center has separate areas for very young and older children, with age- appropriate activities in each area.
   
 Earlier this week, Martinez said there were six children at the center.
   
 On Wednesday, Martinez made the decision to close. She said one of her concerns is that one of her staff members is pregnant.
   
 Martinez said some of her staff members offered to work for free, but she didn't want them to do that.
   
 Martinez stressed that as far as she knows no one at the business has COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, but she does not feel she could take a chance.
   
 "I tried as long as I could to hang in there, especially for my staff," Martinez said. "You can replace money, you can replace the business, but you can't replace life. I just couldn't risk it."
   
 In the face of it all, though, Martinez said she remains optimistic, calling on her faith for strength.
   
 "I am blessed and highly favored," she said. "God will have my back."
