Another one of the top Week 9 college football predictions from the model: Texas Tech (+14.5) covers at home against No. 24 Oklahoma in a Big 12 battle at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday. The Red Raiders are coming off an impressive 34-27 victory over the West Virginia Mountaineers last Saturday.
 Texas Tech used a dynamic rushing attack to upset the Mountaineers, rushing for 179 yards and three touchdowns. Sophomore running back SaRodorick Thompson has been the catalyst for Texas Tech's offense this season, averaging 5.5 yards per carry with five rushing touchdowns.
 And while Oklahoma has won eight consecutive matchups between these programs, the Sooners have struggled to cover the spread. In fact, Oklahoma is 5-10 against the spread in its last 15 games overall. In addition, the Sooners are just 1-5 against the number in their last six games on the road against Texas Tech. The model is calling for Texas Tech to score 34 points on Saturday against an Oklahoma defense that has given up 37 or more points in three of its last four games, resulting in the Red Raiders covering the spread in over 60 percent of simulations.

Most people think that he basically destroyed RKO Studios. When he bought it, it was profitable, and then when he ended up divesting it in the mid-1950s it was a shell of what it had formerly been. Throughout the time when he owned it and operated it he had a really hard time producing and releasing enough movies to maintain a profit. This has to do with his personal perfectionism. He would send a movie into production and then he would fire director after director. He would be unhappy with the dailies. He would make casting changes, and then sometimes movies would be finished and they would just sit on a shelf for months or even years because he wasn't sure what to call the film — he would change the title over and over again, or he would wait for inspiration to strike him in terms of marketing. He ended up being sued by a lot of the shareholders for RKO because they felt that he was just pilfering away their money.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes Manchester United are back on course as the 1999 treble hero prepares to take the wheel for the 100th time.
 Parachuted into the Old Trafford hotseat initially as a temporary replacement for Jose Mourinho in December 2018, the Norwegian has been on a rollercoaster ride as he attempts to get the club back to the top.
 October has been a microcosm of such highs and lows, with the month starting with a chastening 6-1 home loss to Tottenham and ending in a jaw-dropping 5-0 Champions League win against RB Leipzig.
 United kick-off November with a home clash against Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal on Sunday, when Solskjaer – to his shock – will reach a century of matches in charge.

Don't roll your eyes at the premise either. A great team getting the No. 1 pick has happened before in sports. In 1982 after winning the NBA title with Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the Los Angeles Lakers took future Hall of Famer James Worthy with the No. 1 pick thanks to a trade three years earlier with the Cavaliers.)
 The Chiefs, Cardinals and Bengals were all unanimous choices in this poll. That those three would be set at quarterback despite Lawrence's potential is no surprise.
 The Chiefs have the best young quarterback in NFL history, and though he just signed a team-friendly deal that can pay him a half-billion dollars over the next decade, Kansas City would not draft Lawrence. The Cardinals have drafted two quarterbacks in the top-10 in the past three years and they don't want to make it three out of four, especially when they appear to have found their guy in Kyler Murray. And though the Bengals could, in theory, pull a 2019 Cardinals and draft Lawrence, no one believes that organization would.

The jokes have already begun: "I'm staying up until midnight on New Year's Eve -- not to celebrate the beginning of 2021, but to make sure 2020 leaves!" And, "Is 2020 the Y2K they warned us about 20 years ago?"
   
 If it seems like 2020 has done nothing except going from bad to worse, some good can still come out of it. Education is one such commodity that will be reborn and changed forever in the post-COVID world.
            
 School superintendents from three local districts recently participated in an online forum hosted by Georgia Tech University. "Learners and Leaders in a Pandemic" was a round table discussion with Ann Levett, superintendent of Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools; Paul Brooksher, superintendent of Bryan County Schools; and Yancy Ford, superintendent of Effingham County Schools. The event was moderated by Lizanne DiStefano, STEM professor and executive director of Center for Education Integrating Science, Math and Computing at Georgia Tech.
   
 The local public school leaders all agreed that education in post-pandemic will be vastly different -- possibly even greatly improved.
   
 "What does our future look like?" Brooksher asked rhetorically. "All educators feel like they're going to come out of this better. Public education has been beaten up for the past 10 to 15 years."
   
 Since last spring, parents have seen how tough a job teachers have, Brooksher said.
   
 "There is a new respect for teachers. Parents are realizing that teaching is hard. [This pandemic is] bringing back respect [to teachers]," Brooksher said.
   
 The classroom is everywhere
   
 Some staff meetings that used to be face to face all the time are now held online. And while virtual meetings may not be the preference, it's likely they are here to stay, at least occasionally. Chromebooks, too, will be the norm in classrooms, Ford said.
   
 "Now instead of a bunch of notebooks, students have a Chromebook and maybe one notebook in their backpacks," he said.
   
 Students and teachers equipped with portable electronic devices means that the classroom can be anywhere and everywhere at the same time. Students bring their laptops to school to complete and turn in assignments. They engage in independent or small-group work while the teacher helps another group of students or works one on one. Students off campus -- either at home or at a wifi hotspot -- can access classes live or on-demand.
   
 In 2016, Savannah-Chatham County schools began to work toward the goal of one computer for every three students in the district. (The full plan can been found on the district website at sccpss.com.) While the district was making steady progress in that direction during the past four years and even in the early months of 2020, the pandemic flipped and spun that plan on its head.
   
 Switching to all virtual last March, the district scrambled to ensure all students had access to an electronic device. School computer labs were cannibalized to help make that happen. Funds were solicited and received from community partners; budget funds were allocated to purchase new devices. But with the high demand all over the world for the devices, shipments were slow and delayed.
   
 'We created a new educational system in weeks.'
   
 Of the three districts, Savannah-Chatham is the most populous with 37,000 students.
   
 "The interesting thing is that size makes a difference," said Levett, emphasizing that she and her staff have to consider the health and well-being of a larger population than the other two adjacent districts. "The bottom line is that people have this [preconceived] idea of what school is. Teachers and staff made changes overnight."
   
 She added that district staff and the task force work with the county health officials to operate schools during the pandemic in a way to benefit the most children.
   
 "We could have decided to do nothing. But we used the summertime to decide how to go forward. The guidance is changing," Levett explained. "We were resilient at all levels. We created a completely new educational system in weeks."
   
 Levett continued that just three months into the pandemic lock down, and about a month after the 2019-20 school year ended, the district conducted a "dry run" of what a socially distanced and CDC-compliant school would look like if all 37,000 children returned to school on the original Aug. 5 start date.
   
 "We considered the changing guidance from the state, from the CDC, and keeping people focused on what's good for children, and what's good for staff," she explained. "People say, 'Oh kids can't get the disease'; but kids don't teach themselves. We had to think about [the safety of] our staff."
   
 During the summer, district leaders at SCCPSS worked with the task force to find a solution for the safe reopening of schools. Ultimately, Savannah- Chatham County's school board voted to accept Levett's recommendation to start virtual only, while both Bryan and Effingham decided to offer a combination of hybrid, in-person and virtual learning. Some Savannah-Chatham parents sharply criticized the district's decision, noting that Bryan and Effingham offered parents a choice even though those counties' COVID rates were higher than Chatham County's rates.
   
 "A fuller use of technology"
   
 More technology means more connections -- using time and space in new ways.
   
 Now that some students have returned to hybrid learning as of mid-October, many Savannah-Chatham teachers are teaching virtual students and in-person students at the same time. At the brand-new White Bluff Elementary, all classrooms have ViewSonic touchscreens in their rooms that allow virtual students to see the teacher and the teacher to see them -- as if they're all in the room together. Teachers are being creative with dual screens, iPads and other technology in order to connect with students virtually from the classroom.
   
 "I think for us, the [result is] integration and a fuller use of technology -- to connect more," Levett said. "I might miss you [in person], but it's good to connect on screen and have a good conversation."
   
 And now with the potential to connect with the global community, she added, "I enjoy the use of the technology to connect our students to talk with another group of students in another country who are experiencing some of the same things."
   
 "Teachers are critical"
   
 Bryan County high school students have already embraced hybrid learning.
   
 "The biggest challenge was in March when we had to switch gears practically overnight. I'm reminded every day how resilient teachers and students really are," Brooksher said. "Every classroom in Bryan County high schools are hybrid -- in-class and virtual in the same time."
   
 Ford admitted that not all districts can employ a one-size-fits-all mode of education, and a lot of times it's trial and error.
   
 "We're approximately 13,000 students. The things that may work in Effingham, may not work in Savannah, Bryan, or Cobb counties," Ford added. "You have to do what your board, your parents, and your community will accept. In the end, do what's best for your kids and your staff."
   
 Summing up the importance of teachers and public education, and how that importance will not change in a post-pandemic world, Levett said, "Teachers are critical workers to be valued and respected. They make connections that others can't always make. Teachers contribute in ways not everyone else can. They are not essential; they're critical."

Mary Virgilia Gunn, a native Californian and longtime resident of Livermore, passed away peacefully on Oct. 5, at the age of 85.
 Mary was born in San Francisco, California, and lived in Sebastopol until her early teens, when the family moved to Oakland. She was an honor student and yell leader at Oakland High School, where she graduated in 1953. Mary was a member of the A Capella Choir, and received “Friendly” and “Class Spirit” nods from her fellow classmates. She was welcomed to the school’s exclusive “Acorn Council” for her outstanding activity record.
 Mary was a member of the Foothill Baptist Church and met her future husband, Ron, at a Bay Area Christian youth event. They married on June 1, 1956.
 By 1962, their family of six was settled in Livermore, where Ron worked as an engineer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). During this time, Mary raised her children and was active in the Marylin Avenue School PTA. She also served as a Girl Scout troop leader and spent many weekends hiking and camping at Sycamore Grove Park.
 In the late ‘60s, Mary continued her love of singing by joining the Livermore Barbaree Chapter of Sweet Adelines, Inc. The award-winning chorus shared the American folk art of singing four-part harmony, barbershop style. Mary served as publicity chairman and assistant director and was named 1972 Sweet Adeline of the Year by her fellow Barbarees.
 In 1973, Mary was hired as a telephone operator at LLNL. Her bubbly personality caught the attention of several key players who offered guidance and mentorship. Eventually, she landed her dream job as senior technical coordinator for Laser Facilities. She repaid this kindness by mentoring others who followed in her footsteps. Upon retirement from LLNL, Mary and Ron traveled extensively with American Stage Tours. Alaska, Hawaii, Catalina Island, and Yosemite National Park were among their favorite destinations. Mary holds the record for the tour company’s longest-riding passenger.
 An active supporter of the community, Mary was a longtime member of the Livermore-Pleasanton Elks (Lodge #2117). She was skilled at bowling and served as league secretary at Granada Bowl, assisting her husband, who developed one of the first computer scoring programs. Mary and Ron amassed an impressive collection of bowling trophies and made lifelong friends.
 Mary enjoyed sports, and was an avid fan of the Bay Area teams (A’s, Giants, 49ers, and Raiders). She particularly loved NASCAR, and spent many weekends camping with her family at Sears Point Raceway in the southern Sonoma Mountains, creating lasting memories for her grandchildren.
 A friend introduced Mary to the Red Hat Society, and she soon became Queen of a local chapter, the Razzberry Rubies. She enjoyed meeting friends for lunch in the Tri-Valley area and devoted an entire bedroom to her large collection of red and purple wardrobe items, including sequined scarves and flamboyant, feathered hats.
 Mary leaves behind two sisters, Rev. Pat King and Eleanor Davis; her children, Kim Giancaterino (Warren), Karen Gunn, Kelly Gunn, and Kevin Gunn; eight grandchildren, LaDawnna, Loriann, Rhiannon, Robert, Jodi, Joseph, Kevin, and Ari; seven great-grandchildren; and many extended family members and friends. She was predeceased by her husband of 57 years, Ronald Gunn; beloved parents, Edward and Virgilia (Bassett) King; brother, Edward King; grandson, Robert Gunn; and great-grandsons, Antony Burdick and David Gilbert.
 Family would like to acknowledge the delicate care and counsel received from Hope Hospice (Veronica, Fria, Diane, Sarah), and Mary’s compassionate caregiver team (Emily, Amy, Janet, Donny).
 We feel truly blessed to have had this loving presence in our lives. “Mimi” will be forever missed.
 In accordance with Mary’s wishes, the family will not hold a service at this time. Those who wish to remember her may contribute to their favorite charity, or Dogs for Better Lives at 10175 Wheeler Road, Central Point, OR 97502 (1-800-990-3647).
 Callaghan Mortuary is honored to be serving the Gunn family. An online guestbook is available for condolences at www.callaghanmortuary.com.

At the media briefing, Councillor Cutts said “young people don’t think they are ever going to catch anything” when asked why the alcohol ban had been put in place.
 She told reporters: “What we feared might happen, and what the police feared might happen is people would go to the pub, they’d have a meal and they’d have some drinks and come out and go straight to the off-licence and buy a bottle and go and continue their partying elsewhere.
 “We’re trying to stop that. That’s something which has been blighting a bit of Nottinghamshire… younger people don’t ever think they are going to catch anything.
 “So that’s where that came from and we have supported them on that.”

If you often feel anxious at night, try writing down your thoughts and feelings before going to sleep.
 You don’t have to analyze or _fix_ them—just get them down on paper. The simple act of writing things down often brings balance back into the brain and helps produce feel-good chemicals, like serotonin. Writing also makes things seem a little less scary and overwhelming. One of the best things about writing is that it weakens the impact and hold the anxious thought has over you, in both your mind and brain.

New general manager Bill Armstrong, who was not allowed to participate in the draft as a condition of the Coyotes hiring him away from the St. Louis Blues, voiced support for the decision.
 "Mitchell is a good hockey player, but we need to do the right thing as an organization and not just as a hockey team," Armstrong said. "I'd like to apologize to Isaiah and the Meyer-Crothers family for everything they have dealt with the past few months."
 Miller was the Coyotes' top pick in the draft because former GM John Chayka traded their first-rounder to New Jersey for winger Taylor Hall - who since left in free agency - and their third-rounder to Colorado for forward Carl Soderberg, and their second-rounder was forfeited for violating scouting combine policy. Arizona also was stripped of its 2021 first-round pick for breaking NHL rules by conducting physical testing of draft-eligible players.

REGIONAL — Alameda County has agreed to pay $5 million to the family of a 20-year-old Fremont man who killed himself in the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin after a sheriff's lieutenant left him tethered to a jail door with a chain.
 The settlement reached last week with Christian Madrigal's mother, Gabriela Covarrubias, and stepfather, Jose Jaime, was among the largest sums paid out by the county in five years. His parents, however, do not believe justice was served and continue to demand criminal charges against the lieutenant and other deputies involved, said their attorney, Adante Pointer.
 "No amount of money can replace a parent's heartache and pain for losing their son in such a senseless way," Pointer said. "They called police for help with their son. Instead they killed Christian.
 "Given the way the legal system is set up, the only shot they have at justice is if (Alameda County District Attorney) Nancy O'Malley does the right thing by charging the deputies who took part in this parade of horribles, which ultimately resulted in a kid being buried before his parents."
 Madrigal's parents sued the county for excessive force and wrongful death following their son's June 15, 2019, death, which occurred five days after he was found unresponsive in a jail cell, the chain wrapped around his neck. The coroner's office concluded Madrigal died from the cessation of blood flow to his brain because of hanging and ruled the death a suicide.
 Madrigal's parents called Fremont police for help on June 10, 2019, when he behaved erratically at home. It was the third time that week that Madrigal encountered law enforcement.
 On June 6, officers shot him with a taser when he tried to bypass security at San Jose International Airport and fought with police. Madrigal was placed in a hospital for psychiatric observation and released two days later. On June 9, Jaime called Fremont police because Madrigal was aggressive and screaming. Madrigal told police he had ingested "mushrooms" and used marijuana.
 The next day, when officers arrested him for being under the influence of a controlled substance, Madrigal became combative and was transferred in a spit mask and restraints from Fremont to the Santa Rita Jail.
 According to an internal affairs investigation, two deputies suggested securing Madrigal in a ‘restraint chair,’ but their lieutenant, Craig Cedergren, overruled them and had Madrigal placed in ankle restraints and handcuffs. A chain was tethered to the cell door.
 The next day, Madrigal was found unresponsive, hanging from the chain. He lingered in the hospital for five days.
 During questioning, Cedergren told the investigator that his decision to chain Madrigal to the door was an ‘epic mistake.’
 "I asked Lt. Cedergren if, in hindsight, he believed it would have been a better option to have used the restraint chair versus tethering Mr. Madrigal to the door with ankle restraints and he told me, 'It would have been a better option to do something different, which might have included the restraint chair. Could have been simple – as you said, open the door and make him lay on the floor,'” Alameda Sheriff Sgt. Mark Pickett wrote in his June 30, 2019, report.
 Cedergren retired soon after but was not prosecuted. The Alameda County District Attorney's Office declined to file criminal charges against him or any of the other deputies involved, saying, "Criminal negligence involves more than ordinary careless, inattention or mistake in judgment."
 Pointer called Cedergren's admission insincere.
 "I do not believe he chained Christian to the door by mistake," Pointer said. "Instead, it was a conscious decision, which he elected to undertake knowing he was not supposed to do it."
 Cedergren, Pointer said, then lied to his fellow deputies and investigators when he said the tactic was something he had done previously. According to Pointer, Cedergren said that chaining Madrigal to the door "was not an issue, when in fact, he did tie some other detainees in Santa Rita Jail to a door, naked, for having an extra item of bedding linen in their cell."
 Pointer said Cedergren was not disciplined but was admonished not to do that again. In addition, the report said, Cedergren's fellow deputies questioned whether it was appropriate to chain Madrigal to the door.
 "Even after (Cedergren) tied Christian to the door, he then failed to keep an adequate watch over him. Once again, a conscious decision," Pointer said. "So, the whole idea of this being a mistake rather than a series of volitional acts is belied by the evidence."
 Madrigal's parents, Pointer said, want O'Malley to hold Cedergren accountable "for treating their son less than a dog, for ignoring Christian's pleas for help and for ultimately violating his oath and duty to protect and preserve life, not degrade and take it."
 "The parents feel horrible," Pointer said. "Every day, they live with the idea that they called the police looking for help, but instead, they unknowingly placed their son in greater danger. Every day, they mourn the loss of their oldest son, Christian. There's no amount of money that can dull their heartache and pain."

But there were some surprising teams that didn't make the unanimous poll. The Ravens and Seahawks have the reigning MVP and the leader in the clubhouse for the award this year, respectively.
 Why would Baltimore take Lawrence when they have Lamar Jackson?
 "Baltimore is going to have to pay Lamar soon," one source said. That deal will be the second-richest contract in the NFL behind Mahomes and pay Jackson at least $42 million per year. That could wreck a Ravens team trying to keep its title-contending team intact, and getting a top-tier young quarterback on another rookie deal would be the best way to keep the team together.
 As for the Seahawks, four of the nine respondents believed Seattle would take Lawrence. A separate source noted it's an unorthodox take, but the Seahawks usually think outside the box.
