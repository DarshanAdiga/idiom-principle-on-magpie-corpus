I called Carew and found him magnanimous, as usual, and also direct about Griffith and the current protest movement against racism.
 It was clear he was working through the news about Griffith. He had issued a statement recently, which read in part that he “understands and respects” the Twins’ decision to remove the Griffith statue, but he also remembers “how supportive” Griffith was to him, a young Black rookie second baseman in 1967, and beyond. Carew wrote: “In 1977, my M.V.P. year, I made $170,000. When the season was over, Calvin called me into his office, thanked me for the great season, told me that I had made the team a lot of money, and handed me a check for $100,000. Could have knocked me over. A racist wouldn’t have done that.”

“In light of what’s going on, I’m proud of who I am and what I’m adding to the golf community in terms of diversity,” Theegala said. “Ultimately, we’re all trying to do the same thing in pro golf and that’s make a successful career. Hopefully there is some inspiration behind that, for people who watch me and realize that you don’t have to be the stereotypical white golfer.”
 It has never been easy for racial minorities to ascend to the top ranks of professional golf, from Lee Elder breaking the color barrier at the Masters in 1975 — the year Tiger Woods was born — to Harold Varner III addressing racial inequity while vying for the early lead at the Charles Schwab Challenge in Fort Worth last month while protests began gripping American cities after the death of George Floyd in police custody.
 Theegala was born in Fullerton, California, eight months after Woods won his first professional major championship at the 1997 Masters, and moved to Chino Hills outside of Los Angeles when he was about 2 years old. Woods’ rise had been predicted to prompt an influx of golfers from more diverse backgrounds whether they were recreational players or pros, but 23 years later Woods and Varner are the only African American golfers ranked in the top 200.
 “I always believed that my boy is something special,” Muralidhar Theegala said. “Hopefully things work out, and by the grace of God, he’ll do wonderful. But I believe that he was born to do something great.”
 At least once every two years, Muralidhar Theegala made it a point to take the family back to India, where his parents still live. In 2001, Karuna, his wife and Sahith’s mother, began a battle with thyroid cancer, so her mother, Vijaya Laxmi, came to the United States to help with the children. Every year since, Laxmi has spent six months with them in California and six months back in India. Sahith Theegala balances his connection to India with a Southern California nonchalance: He’s warm and gentle, if not downright goofy at times.
 “I’m definitely very proud of my background and my Indian heritage,” Sahith Theegala said. “But when I’m around my friends and other golfers, it’s not something that I think about.”

“Obviously it’s been a challenge to get everything reset and ready to go for a season that will look a little bit different than what we’re accustomed to. But I think it’s going to be great,” club co-founder Mike Vest said.
 For a while, there was concern about whether or not the club would be able to have a season at all. But with Gov. Ralph Northam’s Phase Three guidelines, which stipulate that indoor and outdoor recreational sports activities can return as long as mandatory requirements, such as maintaining physical distancing where practicable and limiting the number of spectators, are followed, the club was able to put together an eight-game slate, with the first game on July 17.

In this case, that's pretty much exactly what happened.
 A picture, a video, an interview, an action. It was the start of the downfall.
 It was the morning of March 9: Before leaving a media session at shoot-around in Salt Lake City on Monday in advance of a game against Detroit, Gobert touched all the tape recorders that were placed before him on a table, devices that reporters who cover the Jazz were using. He meant it as a joke. When he tested positive two days later, it was no laughing matter.
 The Jazz were in Oklahoma City, just moments away from starting a game against the Thunder, when word came that Gobert tested positive. The game was called off. The season was suspended that same night.
 Just like that, Gobert was a center of negative attention.
