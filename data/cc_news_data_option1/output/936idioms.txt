Maurizio Sarri has urged Juventus to grant Cristiano Ronaldo a suitable gift when they face Serie A title rivals Inter on Sunday.
 The champions will host Antonio Conte's side behind closed doors at the Allianz Stadium, with all Italian matches being played without fans due to fears over the spread of coronavirus.
 Ronaldo made his 1,000th competitive appearance for club and country in last month's 2-1 win at SPAL, where he scored the opening goal of the game.
 Inter's visit will mark Ronaldo's first home match since reaching that remarkable milestone, and Sarri is eager for the 35-year-old to mark the occasion in style.
 "He is an active player, and so not much thinking is needed," Sarri told the club's website, with the five-time Ballon d'Or winner now back in training after returning home to Portugal visit his mother, who is recovering from a stroke.
 "This is a great achievement, but he must immediately chase after new goals. But we know Cristiano and we know that he will be like that. It is a cue for his team-mates to give him a gift."
 Juve go into the game two points behind league leaders Lazio, who have played a game more, while Inter are a further six points back with two games in hand on the Bianconeri.
 Sarri expects the meeting to be of a standard befitting the top-flight's "most prestigious" match.
 "It will be a beautiful match," he said. "It is clear that Juventus-Inter is the most prestigious match in Serie A: for the history, and this year, for the standings.
 "After two important transfer windows, I think Inter has become one of the favourites for the league title, like us. Therefore, it is important for the rankings. I hope it will be a beautiful game, and I hope we enjoy it. It will surely be a difficult game but also beautiful to play.
 "Given their way of playing, a problem, for us, may be the size of the opponents. However, both teams have the characteristics that can put the opponent in danger. And so, it will be a difficult game for us, and one where preparation is needed. But, of course, it will also be difficult for our opponents."

The Seattle Seahawks are facing a running back situation marred with injury heading into the 2020 season. Chris Carson, Rashaad Penny and Travis Homer is a solid backfield on paper, but season-ending injuries to both Carson and Penny could linger into training camp and, in Penny's case, possibly even the regular season - making the need for added depth more crucial.

Italy prepared Saturday to quarantine more than 10 million people around the financial capital Milan and the tourist mecca Venice for nearly a month to halt the spread of the new coronavirus.
 A draft government decree published by Italy's Corriere Della Sera newspaper and other media said movement into and out of the regions would be severely restricted until April 3.
 It was not clear from either the decree or the reports as to when the measure would go into effect.
 Corriere Della Sera said it was "imminent" -- and that those who violated the measures could be jailed.
 The Italian government has found itself at the forefront of the global fight against an epidemic that has convulsed the markets and paralysed global supply chains since first emerging in China late last year.
 The Mediterranean country of 60 million people has recorded 233 deaths and 5,883 infections in the past two 7weeks.
 The virus has now spread to all 22 Italian regions and the first deaths are being recorded in Italy's less well medically equipped south.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) urged Italy on Friday to keep "a strong focus on containment measures".
 \- 'Messed up' -
 Milan is Italy's financial capital and has a population of just under 1.4 million people.
 The entire Lombardy region is home to 10 million and is one of Italy's richest.
 The government decree also covers parts of the Veneto region around Venice as well as Emilia-Romagna's Parma and Rimini.
 Those three cities have a combined population of around 540,000 people.
 The month-long ban on entry to places such as Venice could deliver a crippling blow to the city's already-struggling tourism industry.
 There was no immediate word on whether the Italian Stock Exchange in Milan would remain open.
 "I cannot fail to stress that the draft decree of the prime minister is -- to say the least -- messed up," Lombardy region president Attilio Fontan was quoted as saying by Italy's Sky TG24 rolling news channel.
 \- Jail for quarantine violation -
 The government degree said people in the quarantine zones would be advised to stay at home as much as possible.
 It shuts down all night clubs as well as gyms and swimming pools.
 Bars and restaurants will remain open but must ensure that everyone is seated at least a metre (three feet) apart.
 And it stresses that entry into and out of the new quarantine zones would only be allowed for "serious reasons".
 The draft decree says that those who violate the restrictions could be punished by fines and jailed for up to three months.
 Italy had kept 11 villages with a combined population of 50,000 in a quarantine "red zone" for the past two weeks.
 The government had been expected to announce an expansion of that zone on Saturday.
 But no Italian media had predicted that the broader quarantine would cover more than 10 million people and effectively shut down Venice and Milan.
 \- Coalition leader gets virus -
 Ministers decided at an all-night emergency meeting that broke up early Saturday to call in retired doctors as part of an effort to bolster the strained healthcare system with 20,000 additional staff.
 The head of the Italian ruling coalition's junior partner became the latest high-profile figure to confirm they had been infected.
 "I am fine," the Democratic Party's Nicola Zingaretti said on Facebook. "I will have to stay at home for the next few days."

One added that the arrests were a message to all those in the royal family feeling disenfranchised to stop grumbling and toe the line, saying that if Prince Ahmed can be arrested, any prince can and will be. Prince Ahmed was seen as a person that royals vexed with the crown prince's grip on power could look to, the person said.

And Karen Kamuda, president of the Massachusetts-based Titanic Historical Society Inc., says the site should be protected as a gravesite.
 U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith of Norfolk, Va., the maritime jurist with jurisdiction over salvage efforts regarding the Titanic, said she needs more details before ruling on RMS Titanic's request.
 While the public has an interest in protecting the Titanic wreck site from being pillaged for private gain, and in guarding the remains of those who perished in the 1912 tragedy, a way should be found to carefully retrieve the ship's wireless communicator before it is destroyed.
 The public has an interest in the history that device represents, and what it can tell us about the final efforts to save the ship and the thousands of people on board. The voice of the Titanic should not be lost because of a drawn-out court fight.

City have a few of those of their own, though Kevin De Bruyne’s shoulder will be subject to a late fitness test and, as their slightly laboured win at Sheffield Wednesday in midweek showed, the defending champions are a different proposition without their most creative and effective player. There is a feeling, too, that in addition to performing with more confidence of late United have more to play for on Sunday afternoon because they need the points to claim a top-four finish. City, too, want to qualify for next season’s Champions League; indeed Guardiola has set his sights on second place but they already have enough points more or less to guarantee top four. Guardiola, needless to say, does not approve of such thinking. “We always have to be the ones for whom winning is most important,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what the game is or who the opponents are, if we go out in the belief that the result is more important for the other side than us, then we are going to lose the game.”

 Frank Lampard is reportedly a huge fan of Henderson and the Chelsea boss is poised to make a move this summer - though the timing will depend on whether he is called up for England's Euro 2020 squad.
 Lampard is searching for a new goalkeeper after some unconvincing performances by Kepa Arrizabalaga.

United have not always been great to watch in recent seasons but, if they are on something of a roll at the moment, it is probably down to Bruno Fernandes, their £50m signing from Sporting Lisbon. Instantly putting the Paul Pogba problem on a back-burner, the mobile midfielder has been a success from day one, linking up straight away with Fred and bringing an energy to United’s game that has been missing for some time. United have not lost since Fernandes’ arrival, although it was a close call with the late VAR decision at Goodison last week and even Guardiola described him as an exceptional player.

Of all the winning streaks the Baylor Lady Bears have going, don’t overlook this one: the Lady Bears are on the brink of a third-straight perfect run through Big 12 regular season play.
 Baylor travels to Iowa State for a noon game on Sunday and the Cyclones are the only team that stands between the Lady Bears and another 18-0 conference record.
 The second-ranked Lady Bears (28-1, 17-0 Big 12) wrapped up their 10th- straight regular season conference title three games ago when they went to West Virginia and won 64-39 on Feb. 24. If Baylor defeats Iowa State, it will win the Big 12 championship by at least five games and head to next week’s conference tournament as the overwhelming favorite to win that too.
