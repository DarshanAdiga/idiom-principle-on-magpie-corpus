For good measure, China also plans to send a probe to Mars in 2020. It has tried before to reach the red planet – in partnership with Russia. However, the Russian spaceship that was carrying China’s Yinghuo-1 probe crashed in January 2012. After that, China started its own Mars exploration programme and has completed a crucial landing test in northern Hebei province. Zhang Kejian, head of the China National Space Administration, said the lander went through a series of tests at a sprawling site littered with small mounds of rocks to simulate Mars’s terrain.

Determined to be the drivers of their lives, a growing number of women are traversing a tough road to empowerment by becoming professional chauffeurs -- of cars, two-wheelers and even buses. Driven by financial need and sometimes to just look for fresh career opportunities, the women are cutting through gender barriers to ensure they steer the course of their lives and also stay the course.And sometimes they script stories of remarkable resilience and liberation. Like Gulesh Chauhan, a driver with ride-hailing company Uber, who found herself at the crossroads after her husband passed away in 2007.The woman, who had never stepped out in public without a veil, did not just have to cope with her loss but also the pressure of supporting herself and her then the nine-year-old son. She said she struggled to make ends meet for five years with menial jobs at neighborhood departmental stores. And then in 2012, her mother and son advised her to drive a car and turned her life around.I cannot express in words how it feels. For the longest time I had never even sat beside a man except my husband, and now I drive young men and women around dropping them to their destinations, the now professional driver told PTI with pride. She has been working with Uber for four years and drives on multiple routes between Gurgaon and Noida, managing to make nearly Rs 2,000 everyday.I am happy the difficult days are behind me. But, more importantly, I am extremely proud of having overcome my own fears, the 43-year-old said. Stories like Guleshs are, however, just the beginning, the first steps towards changing the scenario -- one statistic at a time.According to the Road Transport Yearbook for 2015-16 the latest such report brought out by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, women counted for only 1.5 crore of the over 16 crore valid drivers licences issued across the country as on March 31, 2016. Of these 1.5 crore women, only 17.73 per cent drive professionally.No wonder Waled Aadnan was pleasantly surprised when he found a woman driving him on one of his Uber rides. I was pleasantly surprised to begin with. That only gave way to an appreciation of how truly path-breaking her role in society is, she is changing perceptions of gender roles with every ride, meeting myriad people and challenging deep-seated beliefs, the 28-year- old risk analyst said.This is not just a big city phenomenon. Women in smaller towns are also beginning to drive the path towards change. In West Bengals Durgapur town, Sushmita Dutta is defying convention by driving people on a Honda Activa two-wheeler.The 42-year-old has been a partner driver with Indian transportation network company Ola for the last three months. A company spokesperson said they had witnessed a significant increase in the number of women fleet operators over the last few years across four, three and two- wheelers.Sushmita drives for two hours every day, ferrying both male and female passengers, between 7 pm and 9 pm when her 12-year-old daughter is at tuition. The road to becoming financially independent is never easy, especially for a woman, she said.Initially, my husband got very angry at the idea. But when our neighbors started appreciating my job, he came onboard, Sushmita told PTI. I did not take up the job for the money, but because I was bored when my daughter was away. But now it really makes me happy to be able to give my child something from my own money. This birthday I gave her a tripod because she is interested in photography, she said.Sushmita said she would be happier if she could inspire other women to do the same. There are no precise numbers for exactly how many professional women drivers there are with both Ola and Uber declining to give details.Contributing to the cause of making the country safer for women, while providing livelihoods for resource- poor women in the country is the Delhi-based NGO Azad foundation. Under its Women on Wheels program, the foundation aims to empower women with minimal economic and social capital to become professional drivers.Susmitha Alva from the foundation said it has trained at least 2,000 women to become professional drivers since its inception in 2008. It has employed 1,000 of them at their sister for-profit organisation Sakha Consulting Wings Private Limited that provides safe transport solutions for women by women. More than 400 women trained by Azad Foundation that we know of are currently practising as professional drivers in the cities where we work Delhi NCR, Jaipur and Kolkata, she said.V Saritha from a remote village in Telangana is one of them. Having trained and worked at Azad Foundation for nearly five years, she is the first and the only woman bus driver with Delhi Transport Corporation DTC.The 36-year-old has been with the bus service provider since 2015, and currently drives bus number 392 that plies between Dhaula Kuan and Noida Sector 62. Saritha, who was earlier a luxury car chauffeur with Azad Foundation, said four years of driving a heavy vehicle has started taking a toll on her health. And with her income depending on the number of kilometers she drives daily, she barely manages to make enough to support herself and her ageing parents back home.But she doesnt want to quit yet. The work with the foundation was more comfortable, and perhaps I will eventually go back to work there. But, it isnt time yet. I feel if I quit, people will say I couldnt handle the pressure because I am a woman.Also four years back when I joined DTC, I opened a door for women to be part of this world. I dont want to close that door. I will leave when more women join here, Saritha said. Safety is an issue.While many women customers feel safe when they see a woman chauffeuring them around, women drivers also need to be made secure. Besides imparting the training to drive a car, the foundation also trains the women to address technical glitches with the vehicle on the road. To ensure their safety, we have collaborated with the Delhi Police to train them in self-defense, Susmitha from the Foundation said.

Macron is a revolutionary in a suit, not a politician. He is a convinced democrat who grows easily impatient with democracy. He has a lucid vision of where he thinks France and Europe should go next (a mixture of freer markets internally and hi-tech protectionism to prevent Chinese or US domination). He is impatient with the messy democratic processes, in France, Brussels and Berlin, needed to achieve his goals. As a result, Macron, the anti-populist intellectual, has a fascination with populists, cultivating bromances with Mr Trump (failed), Vladimir Putin (on-off) and Mr Johnson (watch this space). Unsurprisingly, the “liberal strongman” approach failed. Populist leaders cultivate enemies and make visceral appeals unconstrained by the truth. Macron is not above the occasional mistruth or exaggeration but, unlike the trio listed above, he does not lie shamelessly. Instead, he Macronsplains.

CALHOUN, Carolyn It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Carolyn Calhoun, a loving wife, sister, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend to countless, on January 2nd, 2020. Carolyn was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to E.J. and Clifford McCann. She moved to Central Texas where she met and married Curtis Calhoun, her husband of forty years. Carolyn was a strong courageous woman. She was a creative business partner who was never afraid to step out of the box and take risks. She could maneuver her way through many an obstacle. Carolyn never saw problems - only challenges to overcome. Despite her busy schedule, Carolyn always found time for her passions. She loved volunteering at the Austin and Travis County Livestock Show and Rodeo (now Rodeo Austin) and spending time with her husband and a multitude of friends. Her biggest passion, however, was her family. She was a proud and loving mother and a fierce Nana. The loss of Carolyn leaves a hole the size of Texas in our hearts, but Heaven has gained a beautiful angel to watch over us. We miss her and look forward to reuniting with her someday. Carolyn is survived by her husband, Curtis Calhoun; sister Suann Claunch and husband Dickie. Her legacy includes her children: Michael Everist and wife Nancy; Tracy Rodriguez and husband George; Cari Lemons and husband J.R.; her grandchildren, Cody, Connor, Melanie, Ashley, Matthew, Kyan, Christopher and wife Patricia, Joey and wife Lisa-Marie, and her great-grandchildren Brayden, Angelo, Charlotte and Bryce as well as countless friends. Memorial service information to be announced at a later date. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to the Rodeo Austin scholarship fund with designation to the Curtis & Carolyn Calhoun Endowment. Checks can be made to Rodeo Austin and mailed to 9100 Decker Lake Road, Austin Texas 78724 or donations can be made online at RodeoAustin.com/donate. Remembrances may be shared at www.wcfish.com.

 No surprise there. The battle has exposed a raw truth that extends beyond vaping. Industry in general knows that the best way to guarantee profits is to get kids hooked, or at least brand-loyal well before they hit their 20s.

GALVA -- Pink-ribboned wooden stakes that outline where a performance stage is to be constructed might make Wiley Park look like a field of dreams.
 But the proposed 900-square-foot concrete pad in the Galva public park is expected to become a reality this year. Ideally, it'll be completed in time for the third annual edition of the Levitt AMP Galva Music Series.
 The grant-funded series of 10 free-admission, weekly concerts in each of the past two years has attracted thousands to this city of about 2,500 located equidistant from Peoria and Moline.
 Shows that feature national touring acts from multiple musical genres have been conducted on spring-and-summer Sundays on a temporary stage in Wiley Park, situated a few blocks northwest of downtown. The 2020 series is to begin May 31.
 Last summer, spurred in part by the success of the concert series, the Galva City Council approved contributing $25,000 toward permanent-stage construction. Fundraising is underway to finance a roof, which is expected to cost another $50,000.
 It's a major undertaking for the community. But in this case, people already have come.
 All city officials and concert-series organizers need to do now is build it.
 "It's hard to commit to that kind of money, because No. 1, you don't know if you're going to get the grant every year," Galva Mayor Rich Volkert, an initial concert-series skeptic, said. "It wasn't anything against the (organizers), it was just a matter of there's only so much money to go around.
 "The fact is, you have to reward somebody for their hard work."
 Much of that hard work was done by someone who doesn't even live in Galva -- someone who began this chain of events by playing host to concerts in his house.
 "It's all John," Galva Arts Council President Amy Martin said about John Taylor, the concert-series chief.
 From his residence in the Henry County seat of Cambridge, about 16 miles northwest of Galva, Taylor works remotely for the U.S. Department of Defense. But music appears to be his muse -- so much so that he built a small stage in a room in his home.
 About 40 people can fit. Taylor said he's booked everything from local children just getting started in music to Grammy-quality performers.
 An emphasis has been on acts that tend not to perform in farm country.
 "I think it's neat for people to experience something new," Taylor said. "It's almost like watching a magic trick. It feels good."
 But expanding that good feeling was becoming a problem.
 "I was trying to reach more people with the music and realized that holding the concerts at my house was a little bit of a barrier," Taylor said. "A stranger might think it kind of odd to go to someone's house they don't know to see a concert."
 At that time, Taylor was taking a graduate-level class in grant writing. As a class exercise, he had to find an organization from which to ask for a grant.
 Through an internet search, Taylor discovered the Mortimer & Mimi Levitt Foundation. And unexpectedly, the grant request became a extracurricular proposition.
 Founded by late husband-and-wife philanthropists from New York, the foundation distributes money to organizations that support the arts, culture and education.
 Matching grants of $25,000 are awarded annually to communities of fewer than 400,000 residents. Admission isn't charged for the concerts the grant funds. Venues can't have permanent seating.
 The grants must be channeled through a nonprofit organization. Enter the arts council, which has existed in Galva for 30 years.
 The arts council conducts monthly music programs and open-microphone nights, among other events. Taylor's wife, Stephanie Taylor, is council vice president.
 "I was trying to figure out where I could get the most support and also where I felt like it could have the most impact," Taylor said. "Out of all the different places I looked around, Galva was the most obvious answer."
 Martin and other board members appeared to be on board with the Taylors' plan from its beginning.
 "We loved the idea of giving families something to do in the summer," Martin said about the series that debuted in 2018. "That was the really cool thing, that it was a family-friendly event where all ages are welcome."
 A group of about two dozen helps organize and operate the concerts. Galva is the only Levitt-grant community in which all the local personnel are volunteers.
 The 20 shows staged over the past two years have attracted a total audience of about 15,000, John Taylor said. Music and performance styles are diverse.
 Among those who have played Wiley Park are folk singer/Delavan native Cody Diekhoff, also known as Chicago Farmer; zydeco performers C.J. Chenier & the Red Hot Louisiana Band; blues artist Samantha Fish; and Gangstagrass, a band that fuses bluegrass music and rap.
 "That was probably as well received as any of them," Volkert said.
 Musical groups from Ireland, Peru and Scotland -- among other international locales -- also have performed as part of the concert series.
 According to Taylor, the Galva group hasn't had to twist too many arms to convince musicians to visit.
 "For them, it's something special because of the hospitality they receive here," Taylor said. "It's a different sort of response than they get playing in a big city. It's a very intimate experience."
 It also appears to be a worthwhile experience for Galva residents who want their city to stop shriveling.
 Departures of industrial firms and downturns in the agricultural economy have contributed to a Galva population decrease from its peak of about 3,200, achieved 40 years ago. Empty storefronts downtown aren't rare.
 "Growing up, I heard from my father and grandparents about how the Galva downtown used to just thrive on Friday and Saturday nights," said Jason Bates, the concert-series vice president. "You couldn't even find a parking spot.
 "By bringing this into our town, you're doing a few things. One, you're creating a great social and cultural experience and making family memories for the people here. But also, you're giving a major reason for people to travel here with their families."
 According to Bates, the concerts have attracted attendees from Peoria, the Quad Cities, Chicago and Des Moines, Iowa, among other places.
 "We get to sell Galva," Volkert said.
 The Levitt foundation appears sold. Of the 20 communities, including Springfield, that received grants announced last month, only three were smaller than Galva.
 But the Galva volunteers are preparing just in case there's a time when a grant won't be forthcoming.
 The city recently purchased the Galva Opera House, a fading, downtown building constructed in 1878. Activities to which the building played host included live theater, a roller rink and high school basketball games.
 "It's got some history to it," Volkert said. "If we didn't save it, it wouldn't be there a year from now."
 The mayor envisions a rehabilitation, at a cost of at least $250,000, that would allow Levitt-type concerts to be held indoors in autumn and winter.
 As for the Wiley Park venue, it will be able to accommodate weddings and other special events, Martin said. She also plans to expand non-music offerings concurrent with Levitt concerts, including food trucks, art displays and yoga.
 Regardless of grant status, then, it appears the Galva contingent is prepared to go the distance in at least somewhat-perfect harmony.
 "We're not going to be able to get the same kind of touring musicians we get with the grant money, but we can still get good music," Martin said. "John has so many connections. The people who play at his house are pretty dang good.
 "People are willing to donate their time. The arts council has survived 30 years with volunteers. I think that says that even if we don't get this grant, we still want to keep doing it."

 Bee Line Daughter Jean Slonaker managed the event on behalf of the chapter, with member Lynn Welsh leading the singing and Beppie Willingham working with students and staff at Ranson Elementary to make greeting cards for the veterans. Jean coordinated with VAMC’s Women Veterans Program Manager Teresa Wenner and Social Worker Shari Jordan to ensure that the veterans enjoyed the best experience possible.
 Each guest received a gift bag filled with personal care products — hand and body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush and toothpaste, lip balm, disposable razors, deodorant, body wash, nail care items, face cream and a small flashlight.
 Each gift was accompanied by a greeting card created by a first or second- grade child at Ranson Elementary School thanking the veteran for her service to the nation.
 Game prizes, including old-fashioned glass ornaments that featured patriotic colors and symbols, were also part of the festivities.

Bursaspor'un 17 yaşındaki oyuncusu Ali Akman, gelecek hedeflerinden bahsetti. Bursaspor'u eski günlerine döndürmek için sezonun ikinci yarısında ellerinden geleni yapacaklarını ve Süper Lig'e çıkacaklarını söyleyen Akman, hedefinin ise milli futbolcu Enes Ünal gibi Avrupa'ya gitmek olduğunu söyledi.Bursaspor'un genç futbolcusu Ali Akman, Antalya kampında İhlas Haber Ajası'na özel açıklamalar yaptı. Takımın durumundan, kendi kariyer hedeflerine kadar birçok konuya samimi açıklamalarda bulunan Akman, Bursaspor'da başarılı olup Avrupa'ya gitmek istediğini söyledi. İlk yarıda 30 puan topladıklarını ancak silinen 3 puan nedeniyle 27 puanları olduğunu söyleyen Ali Akman, 'Şu anda en tepede olmak isterdik. Bunu telafi edeceğiz. Hedefimiz şampiyon olmak ve bu yolda elimizden gelenin en iyisini yapacağız' açıklamasını yaptı.'Timsah Arena'dan çıkmak zor'Bursaspor taraftarının çok iyi olduğunu söyleyen Ali Akman, 'Zaten ben küçüklüğümden bu yana Bursaspor taraftarını izliyorum. İzleyince de keyif alıyorum. Timsah Arena'ya ilk çıktığım maç Akhisar maçıydı ve atmosfer çok iyiydi. Stat dolu olduğu zaman rakiplerimiz buradan çıkamıyor. Çok iyi bir taraftarımız var. Ben Bursaspor altyapısından yetiştim ve bu anlamda Türkiye'de en iyi eğitim alabileceğim yerde yetiştim. Altyapıdan arkadaşlarım da geldi. İnşallah onlar da ben de kendimizi en iyi şekilde gösteririz' diye konuştu.'Cenk abi gibi Premier Lig'de oynamak hayalim'17 yaşında olmasına karşın gelecek için kariyer planı çizdiğini söyleyerek sözlerine devam eden Ali Akman, 'Şimdiden bir kariyer planı çizdim. Bu plan biraz da Enes Ünal'ın kariyer planına benziyor. Bursaspor'da iyi işler yapıp Avrupa'ya gidip ülkemi orada temsil etmek istiyorum. Hayallerim hep Avrupa'daydı. Küçüklüğümden bu yana kurduğum hayallerimi yaşayacağımı düşünüyorum. İstediğim gibi gidiyor şu anda. İnşallah Avrupa'ya açılıp milli takımda da iyi işler yapmak istiyorum. Dünyanın en iyi ligi Premier Lig. Cenk abi gibi Premier Lig'de oynamak en büyük hayalim. Ama tabii ki İspanya, Fransa gibi ligler de çok iyi. Oralarda da oynamak isterim' dedi.'İbrahim hoca bizi en iyi şekilde hazırlayacaktır'Takımın yeni teknik direktörü İbrahim Üzülmez'in göreve geldiğinde takımdaki eksikleri kendilerine söylediğini ifade eden Ali Akman, 'İbrahim hoca ilk geldiğinde bize, 'İçeride çok iyiyiz ama dışarıda çok puan kaybımız var' demişti. Biz de bunun bilincindeydik. Deplasmanda puan kayıplarımız oldu. Menemen maçında kaybımız oldu ancak iç sahada lig lideri Hatayspor'u adeta boğmuştuk. Çünkü bizim taraftarımızın verdiği bir coşku vardı ve böyle olunca çok daha farklı performanslar çıkıyor ortaya. Şampiyonluk istediğimiz için bu oyunu deplasmanda da göstermemiz gerekiyor. İkinci yarıda bunun üzerinde çalışacağız. İbrahim hoca bizi en iyi şekilde hazırlayacaktır. Bu puan kayıplarını yapmayarak istediğimiz yere doğru gideceğiz. Seneye Süper Lig gelecek. Bunun sözünü taraftara veriyorum ve hepimiz inanıyoruz' ifadelerini kullandı.'Altyapı oyuncularına şans verilmeli'Kulüplerin altyapıya her zaman yönelmesi gerektiğini ifade eden 17 yaşındaki forvet, 'Altyapıda çok kaybedilen yetenekler olduğunu biliyorum. Taraftarların yıldız oyuncu görme isteği var. Ben de bir taraftardım ve Bursaspor'a ne zaman bir yıldız oyuncu gelse ben de heyecanlanıyordum. Çünkü genç oyuncuyu tanıyan olmuyor. Ama tabii ki genç oyuncuların çıkması da taraftarları daha çok mutlu ediyor. Bana olan yaklaşımlarını da görüyorum ve benim mutluluğumu paylaştıklarını da biliyorum. Kulüplerin borç batağına girmeden de altyapıya şans vermesi gerekiyor. Bunun da uygulanacağını düşünüyorum. Şu anda birçok genç oyuncu oynuyor Süper Lig ve TFF 1. Lig'de. İnşallah daha güzel yapılanmalar olur' ifadelerini kullandı.'İngilizcem iyi ama birkaç dil daha öğrenmek istiyorum'Kariyer planlaması olarak Enes Ünal yaptığı planlamanın mükemmel olduğunu söyleyen ve Enes Ünal'ın da çok bilinçli bir futbolcu olduğunu ifade eden Ali Akman, 'Kendisiyle konuştuğumda da bana bunu hissettirdi. Onun gittiği yolu izlemeyi düşünüyorum. Benim hayallerimin, onun hayallerine benzediğini düşünüyorum. Çünkü o da kendisini Avrupa'da hayal ediyordu. İzlediği yol, birçok Türk oyuncunun hayali olmalı. Futbolu seviyorsanız Avrupa'da oynamak hayalinizdir' dedi. Kariyeri için kendisini geliştirmesi gerektiğini de söyleyen Akman, 'İngilizcem iyi bir seviyede diyebilirim. Daha da iyi olmasını istiyorum. İngilizcenin yanında İspanyolca öğrenmeyi çok istiyorum. Bununla ilgili henüz bir çalışma yapmadım. Belki İspanyol oyuncular olsaydı kadroda, onlarla konuşarak başlayabilirdim. Ama farklı diller de öğrenmem gerekiyor. Bu hem benim gelişimim için önemli hem de global bir futbolcu olma açısından çok önemli' diyerek sözlerini tamamladı. - ANTALYA

The highland home of snow gums ( _Eucalyptus pauciflora_ subsp _niphophila_ ) has turned a plant whose lowland relatives include some of the tallest trees on Earth into a true dwarf, up to 90% smaller. Reaching a maximum of 10m tall when allowed to grow as an upright standard, it can be further shrunk by cutting out the leader after planting, resulting in a beautiful, multi-stemmed specimen reaching as little as 4m tall. This pruning will also constrict the root growth, improve the character of the tree and prevent it toppling in high winds, so I can’t urge you strongly enough to do this, especially on smaller plots.

HOUSTON -- Deshaun Watson spun out of a would-be sack and coolly completed a pass that set up the winning field goal in overtime as the Texans rallied from a double-digit second-half deficit for a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs Saturday.
 Both teams punted on their first possessions of overtime -- the first extra period in an AFC wild-card game since 2012. On Houston's next drive, Watson evaded a sack by wriggling away from one defender and bouncing off another before rolling out to find Taiwan Jones for a 34-yard reception to set up first-and-goal.
 Watson flexed both arms as the crowd at NRG Stadium went wild -- knowing their team was in position to pull off another comeback win to Houston's playoff history.
 "I told myself to stay up. I mean, it's do-or-die now. I just had to make the play," Watson said.
 Ka'imi Fairbairn then kicked a 28-yard field goal to lift Houston to the victory.
 The Texans (11-6) advance to the divisional round of the playoffs next weekend where they'll face either the Chiefs or the Ravens depending on the outcome of Saturday night's Titans-Patriots wild-card game.
 The Texans scored 19 straight points to take the lead before Steven Hauschka's 47-yard field goal tied it with 5 seconds left to force overtime.
 "We never quit, regardless," Watson said. "Whatever it takes to get the win. I mean, we're going to keep fighting."
 The win gives the Texans their first playoff victory since the 2016 season and extends Buffalo's postseason losing streak to six games, with their most recent playoff win coming in 1995. It's the first wild-card overtime game since the Broncos beat the Steelers 29-23 in the 2011 season.
 The game conjured memories of another huge comeback in a wild-card game. The last time teams from Houston and Buffalo met in the playoffs it was in a game that is known as "The Comeback." The Bills set an NFL record for the largest comeback in NFL history by rallying from a 32-point deficit for a 41-38 overtime win against the Houston Oilers in a wild-card game in 1993.
 This time Josh Allen and the Bills (10-7) used a dominant first half to build a 13-point lead and were up 16-0 in the third quarter.
 Watson had 247 yards passing and ran for 55 yards and DeAndre Hopkins had 90 yards receiving.
 Allen threw for 264 yards, ran for 92 and caught a touchdown pass on a trick play in the first quarter, but often looked rattled late in his playoff debut.
 Three time NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt had a sack and gave a boost to Houston's defense in his return after sitting out since October with a torn pectoral muscle.
 "This is why you come back," Watt said. "I don't know if I meant to come back for these many plays or this much extra time, but these feelings, these emotions, these fans, these players, Deshaun Watson and all the guys on this team, this is why you come back."
 Houston couldn't get anything going on offense before halftime and had 81 yards in a first half where Hopkins didn't catch a pass for the first time since Week 16 of the 2017 season.
 They were finally able to sustain a drive on their second possession of the third quarter when Hopkins had receptions of 14 and 10 yards to help move the ball. The Texans cut the lead to 10 when Watson dragged two defenders into the end zone on a 20-yard touchdown run.
 Watson then dived into the end zone for a 2-point conversion that got Houston within 16-8 with about two minutes left in the third.
 The Bills were driving early in the fourth quarter when Allen was sacked by Whitney Mercilus and fumbled, and it was recovered by Jacob Martin at the Buffalo 47. Houston cashed in on the miscue with a 41-yard field goal that cut the lead to 16-11 with about 11 minutes to go.
 Watson connected with Carlos Hyde on a 5-yard touchdown pass and Hopkins on a 2-point conversion with about five minutes left to put the Texans on top 19-16. Hopkins had a 41-yard reception earlier in that drive.
 The Bills were in field-goal range on their next drive when Allen got a 14-yard penalty for intentional grounding and Buffalo lost a down to bring up fourth down. They went for it and Allen was sacked by Jacob Martin for a 19-yard loss to give Houston the ball back with 1:41 left.
 The Texans trailed 13-0 at halftime and Hopkins fumbled on their opening drive of the third quarter to give Buffalo the ball at the Houston 32. Watt sacked Allen for a loss of 8 yards on third down and the Bills settled for a 38-yard field goal to extend the lead to 16-0.
 Allen scrambled 42 yards for a first down on Buffalo's first possession for its longest rush of the season. Two plays later, the Bills used some trickery to take the lead when John Brown threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Allen to make it 7-0. Brown's pass was wobbly, but Allen was wide open despite having to slow down to grab it.
 It was early in the second quarter when Allen appeared to fumble, and it was recovered by Houston. But the play was reviewed and overturned, giving Buffalo the ball at the Houston 32. The Bills were unable to move the ball after that and made a 40-yard field goal to make it 10-0.
 The Bills added another 40-yard field goal at the end of the second quarter to push the lead to 13-0 at halftime.

All you need is a sunny spot on well drained soil at least 5-6m from a building, to allow for space for its canopy, and you’re good to go. Unlike its far more vigorous relatives, the small stature of this species means it won’t put masonry or building foundations at risk, especially if the tree is pruned to a small multi-stem form. Eucalyptus are among the fastest-growing tree species, so even a 30cm sapling of this dwarf species planted in spring could reach head height by the following summer.
