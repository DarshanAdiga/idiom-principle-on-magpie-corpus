“I appreciate all the people who came out and voted for me. I appreciate the confidence they placed in me and thank them for their support.”
 Saturday’s election was the culmination a nearly yearlong campaign.
 The two candidates filed for a spot on the election ballot at the beginning of the year, with Delano throwing his hat in the ring on Feb. 14, the last day to file for the May 2 election.
 However, health concerns surrounding the spread of the coronavirus caused city officials to delay the municipal election until Nov. 3.
 The Nov. 3 election didn’t decide the issue, as none of the three candidates for the Place 4 seat received more than 50% of the vote — necessitating Saturday’s runoff.
 In last month’s election, Nash led the three candidates with 4,781 votes or 42.32%, followed by Delano with 3,696 votes or 32.72% and Jeffrey K. Harris with 2,820 votes or 24.96%
 The top two vote-getters — Nash and Delano — advanced to the runoff election.
 The Place 4 seat is being vacated by Councilman John Reider, who has served two consecutive three-year terms — the maximum under the city charter.
 The next term for the Place 4 seat expires in May 2023.

BRUISED, battered and emotionally shattered, the photos of an abused Ipswich woman beaten constantly by her boyfriend, made a strong impact on a court magistrate.
 Not only was the woman beaten but her irate former partner threatened to stab her with a scalpel, bashed her with a cooking pot, and made threats with a screwdriver.
 When Nathan Skinner appeared from jail before Ipswich Magistrates Court for sentence for his awful domestic violence, it was revealed that the woman he professed to love feared he would kill her.
 In one outburst of violence his ongoing punches to her face had been like “left, right, left, right,” the woman told police.
 Clearly horrified at his apparent brutality, magistrate Virginia Sturgess told Skinner the police photos taken at a hospital when she was treated, was evidence of the significant violence done against her.
 Nathan George Skinner, 26, from Raceview, pleaded guilty via video-link to 11 offences – three charges of assault causing bodily harm to the woman – domestic violence offence; two charges of assault causing bodily harm when armed with an instrument – domestic violence; threatening violence; four counts of breaching his bail conditions; and contravening a domestic violence order.
 Many of his reported offences were committed between March and June this year.
 Police prosecutor Bronson Ballard said they were extremely serious acts of domestic physical violence, and photos taken when the woman did report the abuse show extensive bruises.
 Police sought a two year jail order.
 “The facts speak for themselves. It was appalling behaviour, horrific acts done by a person who says he loves the woman who he inflicted injuries upon,” Mr Ballard said.
 Mr Ballard said that when the woman was bleeding after being assaulted, Skinner told her he loved her.
 Defence lawyer Matthew Fairclough said he did not disagree with a two-year jail penalty.
 He said although some of her injuries did not turn out to be as serious as first thought, there was significant bruising to her body.
 Ms Sturgess said the agreed facts stated the woman suffered a broken nose in one assault when seen at the hospital in June.
 However, it was conceded that there was no medical record before the court to support that.
 Mr Fairclough said Skinner had spent 6.5 months in jail and he sought his immediate release.
 Ms Sturgess told Skinner his offending was extremely serious, involving significant violence.
 “Medical records when seen at hospital show (the woman) was in fear that you would kill her,” Ms Sturgess said.
 “An entirely justifiable fear when you see (photos of) the horrible violence that was inflicted upon her.
 “The photographs are quite compelling and show significant bruising, two black eyes and a mix of older and fresh bruising to her head, behind her ears, feet, arms, legs and torso.”
 The court heard the woman had described Skinner’s anger at being woken up by cartoons a child was watching on television.
 He verbally abused the woman and armed himself with a scalpel, threatening to stab her.
 Ms Sturgess said his assaults included Skinner punching the woman in the face and head with his fists and breaking her nose – the injured woman saying that she “lost a Coke can full of blood, my glasses obliterated”.
 Ms Sturgess said Skinner apologised, saying he loved her.
 “You told her to pack you a cone (cannabis). Then you came up behind her and punched her in the head, kicked her in the legs,” Ms Sturgess said.
 “You held her head. Tried to kick her in the face shouting that you hated her.
 “You picked up a screwdriver saying you were going to kill her. Hit her with the butt.”
 Ms Sturgess said his cowardly violence included hitting the woman between 10 and 20 times with a cooking pot and pouring a jug of boiled water over her head.
 The assaults ended when she ran screaming to a neighbour’s house.
 Skinner is now banned from going anywhere near her or trying to make contact.
 Ms Sturgess called the behaviour appalling.
 “This poor woman was subject to months of beatings by you,” she said.
 “Domestic violence is insidious and has an enormous impact on people and society.”
 Ms Sturgess sentenced Skinner to a two-year jail term with immediate parole.

That is, until I went over to look at the shows on Interlocken Drive and Prenzler Drive and Goldenrod Road.
 I have three controllers that aren’t even all fully used; these guys have no less than 8. My lights came from grocery and hardware stores; Interlocken guy bought his from some (?) professional lighting place (twinkling lights? Really??). My leaping arches? Fun, until you see the lights on Prenzler that could illuminate the International Space Station when they’re all on full, brightness pulsating perfectly to Trans Siberian Orchestra.

The Liverpudlian was the second member of his family to accept the challenge following Liam Smith's defeat in 2016.
 Alvarez's only defeat came against Floyd Mayweather seven years ago and his most recent victory was over Sergey Kovalev at light-heavyweight.
 Smith, meanwhile, was below par in the second defence of his title against John Ryder last year.
 And it was Alvarez who edged the opening two rounds with his sustained pressure as Smith looked to land to the body.
 Smith was struggling to land his long jab as the challenger closed the considerable gap before landing.
 The champion opened round four with his jab but was soon swarmed by Alvarez who began to display his impressive array of shots, rocking Smith with a right hand.
 Alvarez's defence was as effective as his offence and Smith was struggling to land as he conceded another round in the fifth.
 Smith began to let his hands go as the fight reached the halfway point but he faced an uphill struggle in the second half.

La Banda Municipal con su “Concerto de Nadal”, en el Auditorio de Galicia-12´00 h.-, en un repertorio propicio por las piezas elegidas, algunas con larga inspiración del villancico de tradición anglosajona, el “carol”, y que tendrá firmas de compositores con los que tenemos regular relación en programaciones de temporada, hablamos de Alfred Reed o el holandés Johan de Meij, a los que se añaden Takashi Hoside, Peter Hope y Willy Haustvat, del que se toma la obra “A Swinking Christmas Selecction”, de 1995. El villancico en sus diversas modalidades, acuñará formas de identidad en cada país y en cada cultura al paso de los siglos, remitiéndonos en la memoria hasta los tiempos del Medievo. El “carol” al que nos llevan los autores de la matinal, hunde sus raíces en el siglo XII, hermanado con la herencia aceptada de los trovadores provenzales y las “laude” italianas y que la imaginería del tiempo, plasmará en los documentos pétreos de las grandes catedrales.
 Aunque se asocie al período navideño, bastantes de ellos se dedicaban a conmemorar acontecimientos sencillamente cotidianos, como fue el caso del de Agincourt. “Los cuentos de Canterbury”, darán noticia de alguno de ellos y en general, de la época apenas sobrevivirán textos y músicas anteriores al siglo XIV. Otro documento a tener en cuenta por su importancia literaria, la encontraremos en “The Vicar of Wakefield “, de Oliver Goldsmith, que narrará un pasaje describiendo los cantos de un grupo de paisanos. El renacimiento victoriano facilitaría la creación de himnos navideños como “Once in the Royal David´s City”, al que acompañarán una cantidad considerable, dentro de ese entusiasmo por un género tan familiar, surgido en especial alrededor del Rector Milner White. Quien creó un servicio de nueve lecturas y villancicos para ser cantados en Nochebuena en el King´s College, tras la publicación de “The Oxford Book of Carols”, en 1928.
 Alfred Reed, aporta “A Christmas Intrada” (1981), compositor norteamericano especializado en trabajos para orquesta y para banda, con un amplísimo catálogo, que se complementa con sus labores como director, espacio que le llevó a ser invitado a probar con las formaciones punteras en el ámbito internacional. Estudió en la prestigiosa “Juillard School of Music and Drama” neoyorquina, con el maestro Vittorio Giannini, quien le preparó el camino en las especializaciones que ocuparían sus preferencias artísticas. Fue director de “The Baylor Symphony Orchestra”, de la Baylor University y en su graduación destacó por la tesis realizada con su obra “Rhapsody for viola and Orchestra”, que le supuso la consecución del “Luria Prize”, de 1959. Fue miembro de la “Beta Tau Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia”, una asociación destinada a la confraternización de compositores, entre los años 1955 a 1966 y fue editor ejecutivo de la “Hansen Publications”. La docencia fue otro de los espacios que tuvo en cuenta, sirviendo en la “University of Miami”, e donde compartió experiencias con el profesor Clifton Williams, desde 1966, hasta finales de 1976. Con regular frecuencia, nuestra Banda Municipal pone en atriles obras suyas, que sobresalen por su vistosidad y desenvoltura.
 Peter Hope- transcripción de R. Niesse-, con “Christmas Carols nº 3”, y “Hark! The Harald Angels Sing”, Coventry Carol- The First Novell. un arreglista británico especializado en música ligera y que supo destacar por su suite “Anillo de Kerry”, o el arreglo de la “Mexican Hat Dance”, por la que recibió el “Ivor Novello Prize”. Es autor de un concierto para flauta dulce y uno de los compromisos surgidos de un encargo, fue la música para las nupcias del Príncipe Felipe de Borbón y Leticia Ortiz, en 2003. Músicos clásicos le tuvieron en cuenta y entre ellos destacan los cantantes Jessye Norman y José Carreras. Obras a tener en consideración, son “Irish Leyend”; “Speedbird Salutes”, para la British Airway; “Scherzo” o “Champagne Festival”, además de arreglos como “Three American Sketches” “Majorcan Fantasy” y ”The Lark in the Clear Air”.
 Johann de Meij y la “Polish Christmas Music” de 1995, un compositor formado en el “Royal Conservatory”, de La Haya, en donde se especializó como trombonista y dirección, mientras cuidaba sus preferencias en la composición y en la dirección, con atención a los arreglos en calidad de especialización. Otro músico con el que mantenemos una relación frecuente. Obras suyas de programación asidua, son “The Lord of the Rings”, galardonada con el prestigioso “Sudler Composition Prize”, y que fue grabada por orquestas de primera línea, como la “London Symphony Orchestra”, la tercera sinfonía “Planet Earth”, la cuarta “Sinfonie der Lieder”, además de conciertos para solista, como el concierto para trombón, “T-Bone Concert, instrumento del que es virtuoso y el “Concerto Euphonium”
 Takashi Hosida”- un arreglo de “A Christmas Fantasy”, músico japonés, trombonista y director de músicas para brassband, desde sus comienzos como estudiante en la Universidad. Las investigaciones sobre recursos a través de los medios actuales, dejan reflejo en sus composiciones entre las que tienen particular relieve, “Jackson Five Medley”, “J-Pop”, “Leila on the Hill”, “Little Mermeid Medley”, “A Portrait of Charlie Chaplin” o “Beyond the Green” y “Fly High”.
