The big business response to throne speech was low-key. Behind the scenes it will be pushing hard to put to ensure its fiscal message is heard. Corporate capture of government policy is well entrenched, defining the acceptable parameters of change. Its efforts over the last four decades have funneled income and wealth upward to the very few, exacerbating insecurity, poverty and suffering amongst the many. It has eroded democracy and driven the planet to the edge of a climate catastrophe.

Marina city planning commission member Kathy Biala told KSBW “disadvantaged communities, communities of color in specific, are often victimized by larger organizations that often build environmentally damaging projects in those areas.” Marina mayor Bruce Delgado said his city would have received no water from the project but been saddled by “all the adverse impacts.” Delgado claimed 66 percent of his constituents are “non-white,” and “it doesn’t get any more textbook perfect of an example to exemplify what systemic racism looks like.” To say the least, that charge is highly dubious, unlike the water needs on the Monterey Peninsula.

Phoebe Saatchi Yates, daughter of noted collector Charles Saatchi, has announced plans to open a 10,000-square-foot gallery in London that will exhibit the work of "unknown" and "unseen" artists. The gallery is slated to open October 15 in the city's tony Mayfair district, home to such blue-chip galleries as Gagosian, Pace, and Hauser & Wirth.
 Saatchi Yates will co-run the gallery with her husband, Arthur Yates, with whom she has been working on the project for three years. In focusing on emerging artists, Saatchi Yates is following in the footsteps of her father, a former advertising executive, who is most widely known for bringing to public attention the work of the Young British Artists, or YBAS, whose ranks include Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin. The elder Saatchi purchased the groundbreaking work of these now-famous artists in the early 1990s, while most of them were still students.
 Charles Saatchi, who last year informally stepped away from running his own legendary Sloane Square gallery, will lend a hand in the endeavor. "My dad's role has been to completely guide us, as he has with everything my whole life," said Saatchi Yates. "He has helped us build the program and he has trained us up on all the elements of what the art world has been before, so we can break all those rules."
 The inaugural exhibition will feature the work of Swiss artist Pascal Sender. Wisely, in light of England's recently announced restrictions following a resurgence in the country of Covid-19 infections, Sender has created an app via which viewers may experience the works remotely.
 Despite the pandemic, Saatchi Yates is approaching the gallery's opening with a positive outlook. "What we're trying to do with the gallery is start something that's hopeful and a new way of looking at things," she said. "It's quite nice in a way to be doing something really positive after the strangest year we ever experienced."

Zac Taylor married the daughter of Mike Sherman, who had a stint as head coach of the Green Bay Packers, and later found himself working for Sean McVay and the Rams after they selected Jared Goff with the first pick in the 2016 draft.
 With the Eagles, Press Taylor worked his way into a job as quality control coach and into his current role dealing with Wentz, the second pick in the 2016 draft.
 “He was somebody I could lean on as I was going into the next stage of whatever he had just gone through, whether that was high school football, junior college football, college football, coaching in college, coaching in the pros,” Zac Taylor said. “I’ve always had somebody that I trusted more than anybody ahead of me doing these things so I could lean on him for his advice, ask his opinion.”
 Their father, Sherwood Taylor, started at safety for Barry Switzer at Oklahoma and later coached there and at Kansas State. In non-pandemic times, this would have been a great weekend to get out of Norman and into one of those empty seats at Lincoln Financial Field.
 Not a problem, as Sherwood will enter the result of the game on the “Taylor Bro Bowl” trophy that lies in his office in Norman. Press leads, 2-1, in games they’ve faced each other in the NFL.
 “That’s something that’s obviously a friendly competition,” Press Taylor said. “It will mean something more to us later down the line. But right now, it’s all about our teams. It’s about this game and putting our team in the best situation to go get a win.”
 There was plenty of speculation that Zac Taylor, who succeeded Marvin Lewis as head coach of the Bengals, would bring Press in as his quarterbacks coach. The Eagles kept Press under contract.
 Zac Taylor low-keyed the brotherly part of playing the Eagles by calling the game “business as usual.
 “For Press and I, it’s just another game,” Zac Taylor said on a conference call. “Obviously, our families love just being able to tune in to one game. Usually they’re there in the stands and have fun with it. But for Press and I, it’s just business as usual. We both want to win. We both want the other guy to feel really bad after the game is over. But it’s always a proud moment for my family and my siblings and our wives.”
 Said Zac Taylor, “There’s nobody I’d rather compete with more than my brother.
 “It’s one of those things with your family,” he said. “You’re always rooting for him but if anybody beats him, I want it to be me.”
 Win, lose or tie, for the Taylors, it’s a win-win.

More than 140 objects from Keith Haring's personal collection are on the block at Sotheby's this week, with the proceeds going to benefit New York's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center. The auction, which is online September 24-October 1 and on view at Sotheby's in New York September 26-30, is expected to raise roughly $1 million.
 On sale are items including a Gumby watch gifted to Haring by Andy Warhol, which the older artist signed; works from a show Haring curated at the legendary but short-lived downtown nightspot Club 57; and an original invitation to a TriBeCa show reputed to be the first at which graffiti art by uptown Bronx artists, influenced by the burgeoning hip-hop scene, and the work of downtown street artists like Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat was shown together. Prices range from $100, for a painting by David Bowes, to an expected $200,000-$250,000, for a silkscreen portrait by Warhol depicting Haring and his sometime-partner Juan Dubose. Works by such big-name artists as Joseph Beuys and Roy Lichtenstein are included, as are those by downtown scenemakers Kenny Scharf and John Sex, both of whom were Haring's classmates at New York's School of Visual Arts.
 All the objects were provided by the Keith Haring Foundation, whose mission is to promote and protect the artist's legacy and to continue his advocacy on behalf of AIDS organizations and children's charities. Haring's relationship with the LGBT Center was more than tangential: In 1989, to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Stonewall Riots, the artist painted a mural on the wall of the Greenwich Village organization's second-floor men's room.
 The sale, which has been in the works since last year, comes as the LGBT Center has projected $5.4 million in losses this year, owing to the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Speaking to Hyperallergic, the center's executive director, Glennda Testone, noted that, though the center remains closed for public safety, it has seen a "45 percent increase in demand for mental health counseling and substance use treatment throughout the Covid-19 pandemic."

I’ve been porting Python 2 code to Python 3 on and off for a long time, from back when I was on the Ubuntu Foundations team and maintaining things like the Ubiquity installer. When I moved to Launchpad in 2015 it was certainly on my mind that this was a large body of code still stuck on Python 2. One option would have been to just accept that and leave it as it is, maybe doing more backporting work over time as support for Python 2 fades away. I’ve long been of the opinion that this would doom Launchpad to being unmaintainable in the long run, and since I genuinely love working on Launchpad - I find it an incredibly rewarding project - this wasn’t something I was willing to accept. We’re already seeing some of our important dependencies dropping support for Python 2, which is perfectly reasonable on their terms but which is starting to become a genuine obstacle to delivering important features when we need new features from newer versions of those dependencies. It also looks as though it may be difficult for us to run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (we’re currently on 16.04, with an upgrade to 18.04 in progress) as long as we still require Python 2, since we have some system dependencies that 20.04 no longer provides. And then there are exciting new features like type hints and async/await that we’d like to be able to use.

London's cash-strapped Royal Academy is contemplating the sale of a Michelangelo masterpiece, the 515-year-old Taddeo Tondo, as a means of raising funds and staving off the otherwise inevitable layoffs of 150 staff members, the _Guardian_ has reported. It is estimated that the sale of the marble work --the only sculpture by Michelangelo held by a British institution--would net over $127 million, enough to get the tottering institution back on its feet.
 The Royal Academy was in dire straits prior to the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic, having overextended by borrowing to build a $74 million expansion to celebrate its 250th anniversary in 2018. Now, unable to bring in money through the usual routes--ticket and shop sales, membership fees, and donations--the gallery must contend with a $10.3 million shortfall. Last week, officials announced that they expected to have to lay off 40 percent of staff, or some 150 employees, to cut costs.
 The issue has not unexpectedly proven divisive, drawing a line between those Royal Academicians who believe that the gallery would be abandoning its mission by selling the work, and those who argue that the work, an anomaly within the gallery's collection, would find a more suitable home in an institution such as the National Gallery and that a sale would make the Royal Academy "financially secure for years to come."
 The Royal Academy is not alone in its dilemma; New York's Brooklyn Museum announced last week that it would deaccession a dozen little- or never-shown works in order to make up for a budget shortfall. Director Anne Pasternak told the _New York Times_ the decision to do so was "hard" but in the best interests of the museum and its contents. "What's more core," she asked, "having an appropriately sized conservation team or works that don't see the light of day in a collection?"
 The fate of the Michelangelo tondo is to be discussed this week at a virtual annual general meeting of the Royal Academy's members.

Pederson loosened up a little bit Friday, suggesting that going with Hurts over veteran quarterback Nate Sudfeld was a chance for the rookie to get his feet wet. Hurts lined up at running back and wide receiver.
 “We just felt like it was an opportunity to maybe get him sort of coming on just a little bit,” Pederson said. “It's nothing against Nate Sudfeld or any of that. We feel we have two really good backup quarterbacks. It's a week-to- week decision, quite frankly, based on opponent, based on game plan and things like that. But the things we had in last week for him, he handled well and it's a small drop in the bucket, I think, to probably getting his career off and running at some point.”
 The selection of Hurts in the second round of the draft stunned almost everyone, for the Eagles had several needs. In defending the pick, general manager Howie Roseman refused to ignore the obvious, which is that Wentz has been unable to complete the last three seasons due to injury. Minus Wentz, the Eagles would have had a much better shot of defeating the Seahawks in the playoffs with a talent such as Hurts instead of aging veteran Josh McCown, who also got injured, or Sudfeld.
 Pederson wasn’t secure enough in his game-planning to discuss what role, if any Hurts might have this Sunday when the winless Eagles oppose the winless Cincinnati Bengals at Lincoln Financial Field. Quarterbacks coach Press Taylor, just the same, praised Hurts' work ethic.
 “He’s done a great job,” Taylor said. “We feel like all of our quarterbacks, they’re responsible for knowing everybody’s role at every single time. So, if there’s a time to throw Jalen in there, we don’t look at it as he’s a receiver. We look at it as we’re getting two quarterbacks on the field. We’re threatening the defense in some way, shape or form either with what we’re doing or what we could possibly present to the defense in some way, shape or form.
 “So, every time we do something like that it’s purely to give our offense an advantage and threaten the defense in another way.”
