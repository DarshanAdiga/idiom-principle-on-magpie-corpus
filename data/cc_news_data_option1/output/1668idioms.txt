When reminded of Valerie Harper, who played Jewish New Yorker Rhoda Morgenstern in the hit “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Drescher pointed out a key distinction.
 “She wasn’t Jewish in real life — that’s the difference,” she said. “It was almost like gilding the lily. They didn’t want to have Jews playing Jews in a starring role.”
 Drescher exuded her signature candor throughout the hourlong podcast episode, which also touches on creative disagreements behind the scenes of her new NBC comedy (“Indebted”), her eyebrow-raising opinions on vaccines, her confrontation with ousted CBS chief Les Moonves and much more.

WASHINGTON — Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways Corp and Spirit Airlines on Tuesday asked the U.S. Transportation Department for approval to suspend flights to more than two dozen U.S. airports.
 U.S. travel demand has fallen by more than 95% because of the coronavirus pandemic and airports are trying to cut costs to stay in business.
 JetBlue wants to halt flights to 16 U.S. airports, including Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Dallas and Detroit through Sept. 30.
 Delta wants to suspend flights to nine airports: Lansing, Flint and Kalamazoo in Michigan, and Worcester, Mass., Hilton Head, S.C., Pocatello, Idaho, Brunswick, Ga., and Melbourne, Fla. Delta argues passengers could still use other nearby airports like Grand Rapids or Detroit in Michigan.
 Delta says between April 1-April 22, just 1 to 14 passengers daily flew on the airline’s planes each way from those 9 airports.
 Spirit Airlines asked the department for approval to suspend flights to Charlotte, N.C., Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Seattle, Portland and Phoenix, arguing requiring the flights “during a period of almost zero demand is against the public interest as it wastes scarce financial resources while adding virtually nothing.”
 The airlines must maintain minimum service levels in exchange for getting cash grants from the U.S. Treasury to assist in payroll costs unless the department issues a waiver.
 JetBlue said it “fully intends to gradually resume service to the levels prescribed (by the Transportation Department) at each of these airports as soon as it is both safe to do so and when even the slightest customer demand re-emerges.”
 Earlier this month, the department rejected most of Spirit’s requests to halt flights and said Spirit had to resume flights to the New York City area and to other tri-state airports after it suspended service to all New York, New Jersey and Connecticut airports it serves.
 The department earlier also required JetBlue to keep flying to nine destinations, including Portland, Dallas, Houston and Minneapolis.
 On Monday, the department said it rejected most requests by United Airlines and Frontier Airlines to suspend some flights.
 United had sought to suspend flights to more than a dozen airports including Santa Fe, New Mexico, Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Kalamazoo, Michigan.
 Frontier asked approval to suspend service to 33 U.S. airports through June 10 and the department approved just three requests for service to Detroit, Charlotte and the Boston area.
 United and Frontier declined to comment.
 The department also said it had approved Cape Air’s request to halt flights to New York, but said it was requiring it to maintain flights to three other airports.
 The department has also approved numerous airlines’ requests to temporary halt flights to Hawaiian airports. On Monday, the state extended a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors through May 31.

Only 10.7% of U.S. workers are union members, and they tend to be in the public sector, like teachers or police officers. In the private sector, unions tend toward older-line jobs like utility workers. Only about 1% of restaurant workers are in a union.
 Led by the Service Employees International Union, labor has also targeted the fast-food industry seeking not only to gain new members but to force industry- wide concessions that could help all workers, rather than just those who pay dues, such as the Fight for $15 campaign to raise the minimum wage.
 Efforts like that may contribute to the increasingly positive image of labor — according to Gallup, nearly two-thirds of Americans had a favorable view of unions last year, the highest since 1999. MIT researchers in 2017 found that 48% of non-unionized workers would join a union if they could.
 The battle at McDonald's has shifted from the minimum wage to hand sanitizer.
 Laura Pozas, a McDonald's worker in Oakland, California, joined the occasional brief walkout to push for a higher wage and other improvements last year. Now she is on her second week of striking to demand safer conditions at her restaurant. The walkout began after one of the workers she spent the day elbow-to-elbow with in the cramped kitchen was diagnosed with coronavirus. That woman is now on a ventilator.
 "It's more important now," Pozas, 57, said of her labor activism. "We are so scared ... At least give us security."
 Last week, McDonald's U.S. president, Joe Erlinger, said the company was requiring franchisees to provide masks and gloves and conduct temperature checks when workers arrive for their shifts. Those changes will roll out to all U.S. restaurants in the coming weeks, he said.
 SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said fighting for masks is just a logical extension of other labor struggles.
 "Every one of these workers thinks of this moment as 'We can't go back to the way things were before the pandemic,'" Henry said in an interview.
 Some unions have been able to flex their muscle during the pandemic. Nurses unions have helped hospitals secure masks, gloves and gowns for their workers. Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler closed their U.S. plants on March 18 under pressure from the United Auto Workers union. Those plants remain closed.
 "I have said for some time that the only litmus test in reopening the economy is whether you would send your son or daughter into the workplace," UAW President Rory Gamble said last week.
 Still, other powerful unions have been decimated by mass layoffs. UNITE HERE, which represented 300,000 largely hotel and restaurant workers, said 98% of its members have been laid off. The union has been raising money to help members pay bills, coordinating food banks and pushing Congress to extend health care for laid-off workers.
 Nonetheless, the union known for its aggressive tactics is also making plans for when life someday returns to normal.
 In the long term, spokeswoman Meghan Cohorst said, "we're still going to have to organize and go into new industries."

For the last eight years, Tyler Richardson has made the drive from Andover Central Middle School to Wichita Heights High School.
   
 "I was always worried I was going to get yelled at by coach Auer for being late because of a speeding ticket," Richardson said.
   
 He's paid his dues, being an assistant for Heights head coach Joe Auer for 15 years to getting of the prime job openings in the state. He's won a lot and learned a lot during his time at Heights but Richardson is ready to make his own mark on basketball in the state of Kansas.
   
 "He's always been a hungry coach," Auer said. "While he may have been the last one to arrive at practice, he was always the last to leave."
   
 His task will be huge, following coach Jesse Herrmann, who resigned after 19 years at Andover Central. He was the only head coach the school has ever known and now him and his assistants are gone. It's left Richardson to build his own chapter as a Jaguar.
   
 "I always envisioned myself taking over at Heights," Richardson said. "I played there. I coached there but this is something I went for and it wasn't given to me as someone might have thought with the Heights job. I earned this."
   
 When talking to other coaches around the area, Richardson is highly respected. He's put the time in at Heights, starting by tracking stats for the junior varsity and then getting the freshman coaching position.
   
 Richardson is a man of conviction when you talk to him. He's honest and initially turned down Coach Auer's first offer to coach at Heights.
   
 "My brother was playing at the time, he was a senior," Richardson said. "I loved watching him play and I couldn't live with myself if I had missed his senior year."
   
 Once his brother graduated, Auer came calling again. This time, Richardson said yes.
   
 Fast forward 15 years later, it's a similar position. His interest has peaked on other jobs but none caught his eye enough to leave the confines of Heights. A place where Richardson has helped built the Falcons into one of the premiere programs in the state. During their most dominant run, the Falcons won five championships in seven seasons.
   
 After having a blood clot and in the hospital on his 18th birthday, you have a lot of time to think. This is pre-smart phone so the time is left to think. He thought about his future and what that entailed. With blood clots and surgeries ending his playing career, a former coach asked Richardson to swing by practice for some preseason conditioning to hang out. That eventually led to him sitting on the bench taking stats for the junior varsity. Little by little, Richardson was being indoctrinated into the coaching fraternity.
   
 The educator part plays a large into his decision making. He sees himself as an educator first and a coach second. Coaching directed him to teaching, while for many it is the other way around.
   
 "I never thought I wanted to coach," Richardson said. "At the end of the day, coaching directed me to teaching and I love working with kids and being an educator."
   
 While he's turned down other potential jobs to stay at Heights and find the right fit. Much like he did 15 years ago when he decided the fit wasn't to coach but to watch his brother, he knew when it was the right time to make the move.
   
 "I walked in my wife's office and said 'Are you okay with me being a head coach?' She jumped out of the chair and gave me a big hug. She's more excited than I am I think."
   
 For now, Richardson will start from what feels like scratch. The assistants resigned when Herrmann did, making it a clean slate for Andover Central basketball. The program has made four straight state championship appearances, including the state title in 2019. Richardson understand the expectations and embraces them.
   
 "Coach Herrmann has offered me any support I need," Richardson said. "I'm going to use all of the resources, which seem unlimited right now, to make us the best basketball team."
   
 Carr has given Richardson the ability to hire his own assistants, make this program work the way he feels is best.
   
 "There's no perfect equation," Richardson said of his potential philosophy. "There is a mixture of what I've at Heights because they've been so successful at what they do and some of my own, things I want to instill."
   
 His offense is going to be as fluid as his roster. Unlike college and AAU/MAYB programs where you can build your roster to fit your system, Richardson understands having the flexibility to adjust as your roster adjusts.
   
 He doesn't have to worry about that anymore. His drive is going to be much shorter as he was named the head coach of the Andover Central boys last week. His drive to practice will be a few hundred steps.
   
 "I don't think managing my time to get to practice is going to be as big of an issue anymore," Richardson said.

ASHEBORO -- Two people had to be rescued after becoming stranded while kayaking on the Uwharrie River Sunday afternoon.
   
 New Hope Volunteer Fire Department was dispatched to a possible drowning at the High Pines Church Road bridge near Lassitter Mill Road. When crews arrived, they found a woman in the river holding onto a tree limb and a kayak.
   
 "After descending the 30-foot embankment, we made contact with the female kayaker," said Troy D. Powell, fire chief with New Hope Volunteer Fire Department.
   
 "We deployed a 14-foot roof ladder into the river, securing it with a life rope tied to the ladder and a tree as the anchor. The female wasn't touching the bottom of the river and neither was our ladder. We were worried about hypothermia and needed to get her out of the water quickly."
   
 Fire crews were able to assist the female to the ladder where she climbed to safety.
   
 "We continued the water rescue efforts to get the second kayaker to safety in the same manner, which was a male. We were also able to secure the kayak and get it pulled out of the river as well. We had gotten everyone up the 30-foot embankment and to the roadway where everyone was evaluated by EMS," said Powell.
   
 All the people trapped in the river were rescued before the arrival of other rescue units and Ash-Rand Rescue's dive team, from the Asheboro area.
   
 "It was a great outcome, but it's good to know that we had three rescue units and the dive team on the road," said Powell.
   
 Both people rescued from the river were released on scene after being evaluated by Randolph County EMS for possible hypothermia. No one was seriously injured.

Getting the green light was the easy part. Translating the novel from page to the screen proved a more daunting task. Rooney’s writing, which frequently switches between its two lead characters’ perspectives as they navigate an on- again, off-again relationship from high school through college, leans inward. The novel is about what the characters are thinking and feeling in specific moments, and its conversations and moments of action are sparse. Often, the focus is on what is miscommunicated.
 To help reimagine the chapters as TV episodes, Rooney came on board as both an executive producer and co-writer, penning six installments with Alice Birch. Her guidance was invaluable to Abrahamson, who helmed the season’s first half, and director Hettie Macdonald, who took over for the second. Still, Rooney took some convincing to be involved as a screenwriter.
 “As a novelist, the first thing you see when you try to write a screenplay is all the things you can’t do,” Rooney says. “You can’t do internal psychological process the way you can in novels. For me, it was a lot about learning, ‘OK, what can I do that I can’t do on the page of a book?’
 “It feels like Lenny has found a way to tap into the silence of the book and the actions that aren’t taken and what isn’t said. It felt like that brings a new level of sub-terrain to the story,” she continues. “The emotional energy, the dynamics between them, remain faithful to the novel. The story remains intact. But the way that television allowed us to express that and bring it to life was just so completely different from what I could do in the book.”

 Scheid explains how lobbying has changed this century. In the 20th century, lobbying consisted mainly of phone calls, face to face meetings and testimony at hearings.
 “But social media has changed all that,” she stated. “The IFF uses social media to pressure Idaho legislators to vote consistent with their published scores on bills that the IFF’s either supports or opposes.

 Before this saga kicked off, the source says Kristin and Jay were "staying in the house three days on and three days off," so the kids could stay at their home.

CHEYENNE – Gov. Mark Gordon announced that new public health orders effective Friday, May 1, will allow gyms, barber shops, hair salons and other personal care services to reopen under specific operating conditions designed to minimize public health risk from COVID-19.
 Other parts of the phased approach involve easing restrictions on day cares and issuing guidance to hospitals allowing them to resume elective surgeries.
 “These new orders start our process of getting this part of Wyoming’s economy up and running again,” Gov. Gordon said. “We have asked Wyoming citizens to make sacrifices over the past five weeks, and they have responded. I want to thank these businesses for playing such an important role in our initial battle with COVID-19. Easing the restrictions on these businesses at this time is prudent and gets us one step closer to a return to normal.”

Biden essentially locked up the Democratic 2020 nomination after Sanders, his sole remaining competitor, suspended his campaign. However, the Vermont lawmaker has said he intends to keep his name on the remaining primary ballots to try to win more delegates, who can ultimately influence the party's platform at its convention this summer.
 Ohio's primary, originally slated for March 17, was delayed because of fears over the coronavirus and emerged into a test of how the state would grapple with an election held almost completely by mail.
 While large disruptions appear to have been avoided, overall turnout in the race appeared to drop from 2016. The Ohio secretary of state's office reported that 1.5 million votes had been cast as of midday Saturday, a noticeable decline from the 3.2 million that voted in 2016.
 Several states are eyeing boosting mail efforts ahead of the general election in 2016, with many keeping tabs on how smoothly states are able to run primary races conducted mostly by mail. However Republicans, led by President Trump, have expressed concerns over the prospect, citing unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.
