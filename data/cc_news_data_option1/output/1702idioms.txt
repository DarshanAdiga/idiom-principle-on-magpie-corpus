And as you look through that schedule, I think we've identified 40 to 50 rigs that we don't think we'll ever get another contract just because one, they're older, technically less capable and/or is going to require a massive reactivation to get them back up and running. And so I don't think this changes that story. I think maybe some of our competitors just finally throwing the towel and say, OK, we'll officially scrap it now.

The coronavirus pandemic has thrown a major wrench into the plans of the video game industry as a whole. Developers and publishers have made adjustments in order to work from home, but the reality is that video game development can be a difficult process. As such, some announcements simply aren't as ready as they might have been if not for the pandemic. According to a recent rumor, this is the case for Nintendo's first-party games, which are not in a place where the company is ready to show them off to fans. If accurate, this might explain why a Nintendo Direct has yet to air.
 According to the rumor, Nintendo has reached out to third-party publishers, and informed them that they are free to make any announcements that they were holding for Nintendo's E3 presentation. Apparently, the company plans to hold off on revealing its upcoming games until later in the summer, rather than around the time E3 was set to occur. On the one hand, this might lead to some earlier announcements for certain Switch games, but it would also mean a longer wait for those developed by Nintendo.
 Obviously, if true, this will come as a bit of a disappointment for some fans. After the release of _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_ , the company really doesn't have much in the way of announced first-party games on the way. _Metroid Prime 4_ and _Breath of the Wild 2_ are both in production, but it seems quite likely that neither game will see release for some time.
 During any other console generation, this might have been problematic for Nintendo, but the company has forged strong relationships with indie developers and third-party publishers in the Switch era. The console has an incredibly large library, and it seems likely that it will only continue to grow, as demand for the system increases.

 It will be interesting to see what Nintendo has to show off when their next Direct presentation is ready to air. The next DLC fighter for _Super Smash Bros. Ultimate_ seems quite likely, and there have been unconfirmed rumors regarding remastered versions of a handful of 3D Mario games. Beyond that, it's anyone's guess! Knowing Nintendo, whatever comes next will certainly get fans talking.

Veteran Kiwi batsman Ross Taylor on Friday claimed the top honour on the final day of the 2020 New Zealand Cricket Awards, winning the prestigious Sir Richard Hadlee Medal for the third time while Tim Southee was named Test Player of the Year. The virtual ceremony also saw Canterbury umpire Kim Cotton's meteoric rise through the officiating ranks recognised with the GJ Gardner Homes New Zealand Cricket Umpire of the Year award.Taylor had a great season, he helped guide the Blackcaps to a second successive ICC Cricket World Cup Final. He surpassed Stephen Fleming's all-time Test runs scoring record for New Zealand and became the first cricketer to play 100 international games in each of the three formats. The 36-year-old was once again the glue in the top-order, amassing 1,389 runs across the three formats in a season in which he played in all but one of the Blackcaps' 32 internationals, from England to Sri Lanka, Australia and at home.Taylor reflected on the influence of the late Martin Crowe who was instrumental in developing the right hander's Test technique and helping him to set his goals. "I'm sure he would be proud of this. Marty was able to pass on a lot of his experience and wisdom which has played a massive part in my career," Taylor said."It was always something that he always pushed me to do (break records). I think he would probably be surprised at how well I have done. But I've been fortunate to be helped by a lot of people over the years and I guess when you win awards like this it's nice to be able to thank them," he added. On the other hand, Southee claimed 40 wickets from eight Tests, including 14 in the two-Test wins against India, in Wellington and Christchurch.In the four Tests, the Kiwis won during the judging period, he took 25 wickets at an average of 16.40.

As the novel coronavirus sweeps across the United States, it appears to be infecting and killing black Americans at a disproportionately high rate, according to a Washington Post analysis of early data from jurisdictions across the country. The emerging stark racial disparity led the surgeon general Tuesday to acknowledge in personal terms the increased risk for African Americans amid growing demands that public-health officials release more data on the race of those who are sick, hospitalized and dying of a contagion that has killed more than 12,000 people in the United States. A Post analysis of what data is available and census demographics shows that counties that are majority-black have three times the rate of infections and almost six times the rate of deaths as counties where white residents are in the majority.

Oil prices rallied Friday as massive output cuts began to kick in and top producers said they would turn the taps lower, while there were also hopes for a pick-up in demand as economies slowly reopen.
 After a diabolical month for the commodity in which the May WTI contract fell to a mind-boggling minus $40, investors were a little more upbeat about the outlook, though analysts warned the market was not yet out of the woods.
 In early trade, US benchmark WTI for June was up almost five percent at $19.75, having piled on 25 percent in each of the previous two days.
 Brent for July delivery gained 2.4 percent to $27.12 on its first day of trading, with the June contract closing without any of the flurry of selling suffered by US oil two weeks ago.
 The gains this week are in line with strong advances across equity markets, which have been fuelled by signs of a slowing of coronavirus infections and deaths in some of the worst-hit nations.
 The uptick has also been sustained by governments beginning to ease lockdown restrictions that have hammered oil demand for months.
 News that US stockpiles had risen slower than expected last week, as well as a surprise drop in gasoline reserves also provided support.
 "Demand has most likely troughed with several large economies now considering 'exit strategies' or 'new normal' and lifting draconian lockdown restrictions," said AxiCorp analyst Stephen Innes.
 Optimism has also been boosted by news of successful early testing of a possible virus treatment in the United States.
 Output cuts of 10 million barrels a day agreed by OPEC and other top producers will start Friday, though some countries had already started earlier this week.
 Norway, which was not part of that deal, said it would slash 250,000 barrels from its daily output in June, while ConocoPhillips said it would chop 400,000 barrels a day.
 However, with US storage facilities near bursting and demand still pummelled, Citigroup warned of further volatility before the oil market enjoys some sort of stability.

CHESTER -- In an effort to expand the fight against COVID-19, independent Rx3 Compounding Pharmacy [Rx3] is participating in a global campaign that supplies hand sanitizer to first responders.
   
 Pharmacists and co-owners Sonny and Chris Currin and their Rx3 team are donating an estimated 500 bottles of hand sanitizers to the Chesterfield Fire & EMS.
   
 The #CompoundingHandoff campaign was launched by the Professional Compounding Centers of America [PCCA], National Community Pharmacists Association [NCPA], and the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding [APC].
   
 Following guidelines put in place from the World Health Organization, Rx3 Pharmacy has access to formulas to compound pharmaceutical grade, alcohol- based hand sanitizer that is FDA-approved.
   
 "We have a technician whose husband works for the fire department, and we became aware of their need for hand sanitizer," shared Chris. "We're definitely living in unusual times, and we fill the void for medications on short supply; in this case, we filled the gap."
   
 "The men and women of Chesterfield Fire & EMS truly appreciate our community partnership with Rx3 Compounding Pharmacy," stated Public Information Officer Lieutenant Jason Elmore. "Their gracious gift of hand sanitizer will allow our firefighters to stay healthy and to protect our community while responding to emergency incidents."
   
 "Rx3 Compounding Pharmacy wants to be a resource and assist the first responders in our area," says Sonny. "Ensuring our patients and local first responders have hand sanitizer is key to fighting COVID-19, and our pharmacies are ready to meet this need."
   
 Compounding hand sanitizer is important, now more than ever, with the supply becoming scarce in many retail stores and pharmacies. With Rx3's ability to compound hand sanitizer, first responders, patients, and the community can help fight the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "We really appreciate its ease to apply and how it conveniently fits in our pockets," stated Lieutenant Kenny Mitchell. "With all the supplies across the country being depleted, we're grateful to receive the donation since as first responders we get close to 50,000 calls per year in Chesterfield County."
   
 "We are committed to helping stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus in our community so we can all resume normal lifestyles soon," added Elmore.
   
 "As this health emergency continues, we hope the FDA will allow compounders to meet patient needs for the other essential items that may go into drug shortage," says Sonny.
   
 According to Chris, Rx3 has experienced a decrease in foot traffic, however their curbside service and home delivery are in demand.
   
 Rx3 Compounding pharmacy is also ready and able to assist doctors and patients looking for customized drug formulations that are not commercially available. With the current drug shortages, compounding pharmacists have the expertise to provide compounded alternatives to over the counter medications.
   
 Aside from compounding, Rx3 also specializes in professional-grade nutraceutical supplements, CBD, and specialty testing and consultations.
   
 "We have multiple avenues to keep immune systems strong," stated Chris. "Vitamin supplements are selling extremely well during this pandemic."

Ahead of the crucial Legislative Council election in the state, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday paid a courtesy visit to Raj Bhavan here on the occasion of Maharashtra Day and met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. Their meeting lasted for around 20 minutes. The move comes at a time when the Election Commission of India (ECI) is scheduled to hold a meeting over elections to the Legislative Council in Maharashtra. The meeting is scheduled to begin at 9.30 am today.Every year, Governor and Chief Minister meet on Maharashtra Day in a traditional parade at Shivaji Park but this year the celebrations are curtailed due to COVID-19. So, the Chief Minister went to Raj Bhavan to call on the Governor, a CMO official said. Earlier, Governor Koshyari had requested the ECI for the election to nine seats of the Legislative Council in the state.The Governor has made the request in a letter to the Election Commission, to fill the 9 seats in the legislative council, that has been lying vacant from April 24, "with a view to ending the current uncertainty in the state." He has stated that the Central government has announced many relaxation measures regarding the enforcement of lockdown in the country. As such the elections to the council seats can be held with certain guidelines, said Koshyari."Since Chief Minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray is not a member of either house of the State Legislature, he needs to get elected to the Council before May 27," he added. Earlier, Election Commission had withheld the election process for these 9 seats in view of the COVID-19 situation in the country.This came after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi about his nomination to the State Legislative Council. According to sources, Thackeray sought Prime Minister Modi's help, saying if it doesn't happen, he will have to resign. Prior to that, the Maharashtra Cabinet had on April 28 once again had asked Governor Koshyari to nominate Chief Minister Thackeray to the State Legislative Council.Before that on April 9, the state cabinet had recommended Thackeray's name for one of the two vacant MLC seats that were to be nominated by Koshyari to the Legislative Council to avoid a constitutional crisis.

Wanting to jump the queue on accessing the vaccine does seem like a dodgy motive, though. By WHO standards, those countries at most risk – by dint of having say, inadequate healthcare systems - will be at the front of any Covid-19 vaccine queue, and so they should be. That aside…obviously, vaccines against the virus of course are not the same thing as anti-viral treatments for the infection itself. Of all the rival treatments pouring onto the market, Gilead’s remdesivir is currently the most promising drug, although the results so far indicate that it is no magic bullet. A less than one third saving in hospitalisation time and an 8% fatality rate compared to 11% with placebo clearly isn't a ringing endorsement for the drug. But it might be a useful initial platform, maybe qwhen taken in unison with subsequent treatments.

 The league was suspended on March 12 with FC Porto leading defending champions Benfica by a point after 24 rounds in an exciting two-horse race for the title.
 Porto, runners-up last season, have 60 points, one more than their Lisbon- based rivals, with Sporting Braga a distant third on 46.
 Portugal would be one of the first major European leagues to resume action amid the Covid-19 pandemic, with France and the Netherlands having already cancelled their seasons.
 Belgium initially announced they would do likewise, though that decision still needs to be ratified by the clubs and a final vote will be taken on Monday as they await more clarity on a possible easing of lockdown rules.
 Portugal has reported 25,045 cases of the coronavirus and 989 deaths, a comparatively low toll backed up by one of the highest testing rates worldwide at 37,000 per million people.
 The country's health system has remained below 65 percent of hospital bed capacity throughout the pandemic, with nine out of 10 cases treated at home and just 1 percent needing intensive care.

A new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) has two important revelations about the impact of Covid-19 on energy demand.
 It said that all fuels, except renewables, will record a decline in demand in the coming decades. The agency also said that global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions this year are set for record fall, six times larger than the fall recorded after the 2008 financial crisis and twice as large as all previous reductions since World War II.
 The record fall in CO2 emissions is not a good sign as it is a clear indicator of a massive economic shock and the fall may be temporary followed by more investments in dirty fuel, experts who drafted "Global Energy Review 2020" released on Thursday said.
 "Resulting from premature deaths and economic trauma around the world, the historic decline in global emissions is absolutely nothing to cheer," IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a statement. "And if the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis is anything to go by, we are likely to soon see a sharp rebound in emissions as economic conditions improve. But governments can learn from that experience by putting clean energy..." he added.
   
   
 Daily data for this year till mid-April shows that countries in full lockdown are experiencing an average 25 per cent decline in energy demand per week and countries in partial lockdown an average 18 per cent decline. Global energy demand has already declined by 3.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, with most of the impact felt in March when lockdowns were enforced in Europe, North America and others.
 The report projects that energy demand will fall six per cent in 2020 - seven times the decline after the 2008 financial crisis. The IEA said, "The decline is unprecedented - the equivalent of losing the entire energy demand of India, the world's third largest energy consumer."
 Depending on the duration of restrictive measures, developed countries are expected to see the biggest fall in energy demand - by nine per cent in the US and by 11 per cent in European Union.
 The energy landscape has already changed because global coal demand in the first quarter fell by eight per cent compared to last year. This was mainly due to China, a coal based economy, which was hardest hit in the first quarter. Oil demand fell by five per cent in the first quarter mainly because of restrictions on transport and aviation. But renewables recorded a growth in demand, driven by larger installed capacity in the first quarter.
 The IEA said that renewables receive priority in the grid and are not asked to adjust their output based on demand which insulates them from the impacts of lower energy demand. This resulted in renewables grabbing a higher share in the energy mix with record-high hourly shares in Belgium, Italy, Germany, Hungary and eastern parts of the United States. The IEA also stated that demand for renewables this year and in coming years will increase due to low operating costs.
 As a result of these trends in fall in oil and coal demand, global energy- related CO2 emissions are set to fall by almost eight per cent in 2020, a record drop. It will be six times larger than the one recorded in 2009. "The coronavirus pandemic has triggered a macroeconomic shock that is unprecedented in peacetime... these restrictions (lockdown) represent a challenging combination of a supply and a demand shock," the report concluded.
 The impact on energy demand in India is yet to be seen. In the first quarter, energy demand in India increased by 0.3% in comparison to last year. As the lockdown continues, the impact on energy demand will be much larger in the second quarter.
 Experts said that Covid-19 comes with an important opportunity. "The current pandemic has brought the world to its knees. While countries are facing a public health crisis in the near-term, the world has an opportunity to show resilient character in how it deals with the issues of climate change in the long term," said Karan Mangotra, associate director, The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI). He added, "We are all privy to the clear skies and 'very good' AQI numbers during the lockdown period. However, to sustain this we would need to ensure that our recovery is green and sustainable lest we have a negative rebound. How do we ensure that the construction, aviation and the automobile industries are equipped to make greener transitions? Can our recovery for some of the polluting sectors be conditional to being green and sustainable? These are some of the important questions that need to be thought through lest we let go of this opportunity."
 "In the short term, the drop in power generation from coal and gas has transported power systems several years into the future, with the share of renewable energy setting new records. The longer-term impact depends on government policies," said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).
 "Above all, this is an opportunity to close down polluting and outdated capacity, and speed up the development of renewable energy as a part of the economic recovery packages being prepared around the world. Renewable energy played an important role in job creation and economic recovery after the global financial crisis and this can be true of the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis as well. In India, it's vital to align the power sector bailout package that is being prepared with the shift to clean energy, by closing down old, loss-making thermal power plants, upgrading grid infrastructure and accelerating renewable energy development," he added.
 "Drop in carbon emissions is a side effect that doesn't offset the damage especially because a short-term drop in CO2 is not useful as far as climate change is concerned. Only sustained changes in emissions are relevant here. In terms of a rebound, I expect almost all of these gains to be reversed. On the bright side, it's plausible that some of the technology we have started using might normalise more environmentally friendly practices. For instance, flying for meetings could plausibly be reduced since it has been shown that video conferences can often work well," said Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

That means Baramundi still doesn’t have the ability to right-click on a device and perform an action such as lock or wipe. While the jobs paradigm makes sense in a large device management context, it doesn’t make the task of quickly responding to a panicked user any easier. The platform also still doesn’t support any type of geolocation-based services, which seems like a rather large oversight in this day and age. Another problem was that during our testing, once we initiated the wipe process, it took over 10 minutes to execute.

Michael Hudson and I believe that an economic system that enriches the rentier class by converting as much of personal income as possible to the service of debt is an economic system that is dead in the water. One possible way out is a debt writedown in order to create some discretionary income. Keep in mind that when the replacement of offshored manufacturing jobs with Walmart jobs stopped US GDP growth, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan subsituted growth in consumer debt for the missing income growth, and by this substitution created discretionary income by loading up the consumer with debt.

A NEW mobile health service will support the respiratory health of mine workers by bringing state-of-the-art facilities to regional communities.
 The B-double mobile clinic will provide health assessments to current and former mine and quarry workers to assist with the early detection of mine dust lung diseases like black lung and silicosis.
 Heart of Australia is expected to have the truck on the road by the end of the year, offering X-ray and CT services to rural and remote communities.
 Heart of Australia founder Dr Rolf Gomes said the mobile clinic would take the state-of-the-art equipment to communities where it was needed.
 “Ultimately in medicine you can only treat the problems you can find, and access to medical imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients,” he said.
 “Providing rural patients access to locally delivered medical imaging services will make an enormous difference and save lives.”
 Dr Gomes said the truck would be built and fitted out in Queensland and operated by a multidisciplinary team.
 “When you step on board the new mobile clinic you will find a range of sophisticated equipment similar to what you would find in a respiratory practice in the city,” he said.
 “There will be the capacity to conduct full health assessments for current and former mine workers, including chest X-ray screenings, as well as follow-up investigations like high-resolution computed tomography and complex lung function testing where required.”
 Health assessments for mine rescue personnel and additional health services for the mining community, including respiratory and hearing protection fit testing, will also be provided.
 Assistant State Development Minister Julieanne Gilbert said the service would travel across the state, servicing communities in the Bowen Basin along the way.
 “The 25m two-trailer truck is projected to clock about 50,000km annually, delivering chest X-rays and respiratory checks,” she said.
 “The mobile service will complement existing health facilities already available to current and former workers across the state.”
 The new truck, funded by the Queensland Government, will join the current fleet of custom-designed trucks operated by Heart of Australia.

As part of the continued easing of coronavirus restrictions to be presented to the government for approval, it seems as though from Sunday and on, beaches will reopen for sports such as swimming and surfing, while public pools will reopen for professional sport and treatment alone.
 Channel 13 reports that sport clubs will be permitted to reopen, as well.
 According to the report, the social distancing rules will stay intact and sitting at the beach will not be permitted.
 As such, it seems as though on Sunday, the opening of malls and gyms will be presented as an offer to the government, but will only be implemented the following week.
 Parks and national parks will stay closed for now, while the Israel Railway is expected to gradually reopen.
 The first stage of the plan is expected to be implemented on May 17, which is when all lines will return to working order with the exception of the line running between Tel Aviv Central Station and Hertzliya, where the platform for electric trains is being installed.
 The implementation, which will allow a train to run directly from Jerusalem through Tel Aviv to Hertzliya, is scheduled to be implemented on June 1.
 In addition, it seems as though the Mahane Yehuda market in Jerusalem will be opened. Employees of the market have previously protested about its closure, calling it hypocritical in light of IKEA being permitted to reopen.
 Stations of the market will seemingly be separated using translucent separators and shoppers will have their temperatures taken at the entrance to the marketplace by inspectors. Two meter stripes will be marked on the ground between booths.
 As part of the government instructions which allow the increase of the number of people permitted to leave home to work, Transport Minister Bezalel Smotrich approved on Thursday the recommendation of the National Public Transport Authority to return public transport after 8 p.m. each evening. This will be implemented from May 5 and on. Public transportation will still be shut from Thursdays at night until the following Sundays at 5 a.m.
 Several lines have returned throughout the country to more consistent activity, after which the country saw a 20% increase in public transportation usage. However, this is still a fraction of the number of people who would travel by public transportation in contrast to before the coronavirus crisis.

The Belgian region of Wallonia said on Thursday that tonnes of fish were killed in a river by pollution that flowed across the border from France and accused the French authorities of being too slow to issue a warning.
 The Belgian region said the problem was caused by a leak at a sugar beet refinery, although the French company said there was no proven link between the dead fish in Belgium and the leak at its facility.
 Wallonia, which abuts the border with France, said 50 - 70 tonnes of fish died in its territory along a 36 km stretch of the Scheldt river, also known as the Escaut, and that France's slow response had compounded problems.
 The French environment ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 French sugar maker Tereos said a leak had been found on April 9 in a 100,000 cubic metres settling pond at its factory in Escaudoeuvres in northern France, which lead to the spill of waste water into a tributary of the Scheldt.
 "Wallonia was not been warned by France. It is important to understand why and above all, do things differently in the future," Wallonia Environment Minister Celine Tellier said, adding that a polluter could be fined of up to $1.1 million in Wallonia.
 The Scheldt runs from northern France to the port of Antwerp in northern Belgium, Europe's second largest seaport.
 Tereos said the rinsing water leak was repaired on April 10 and the river's water quality was back to normal by April 13 on the French side of the Scheldt after aerators were installed.
 "At this stage, it is impossible to establish a proven causal link between the incident at Escaudoeuvres in France and what is reported from the situation in Belgium with large-scale fish mortality," the company said in an emailed statement.
 The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on whether any fish had died in the French section of the river as a result of the leak.
 Sugar beet residues are rich in organic matter and can drive down oxygen levels in rivers, France's Biodiversity Office says.
 The Belgian region of Flanders, further downstream, was also affected but less severely, a spokesman for the regional environment minister said.
 Paul-Olivier Delannois, the mayor of Tournai in southern Belgium, through which the river runs, complained in a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron. "France had the information for some time and did not transmit it and that is unacceptable," he said.

It looks as though the Baggies will complete their season sooner rather than later with the EFL and the government drafting up plans to finish the fixture list behind closed doors.
 However, with hundreds dying each day and the official death toll now exceeding 26,000, Livermore says there is no room for error.
 "I can’t speak for others but on a personal note my best friend’s partner lost their dad and it all became real then," he revealed.
 "It was before and we were all being very respectful, but when you see the effects of it on somebody so close to you it does make a difference.
 "I think from that, and I mean that respectfully, once it’s someone who is almost family - you feel it."

With a heavy heart full of love for one another we have decided it is best for us to take a step back from our relationship. We ultimately want what is best for us in the long run and for us right now, that means being apart and growing individually.”

Well, there's a lot of information online. There's a lot of dealers and ways of accessing stuff. But I would collect from what moves you, what emotionally you're connected to, films that you love. Don't collect because you think it's going to look cool on the shelf when someone comes into your house. Collect because it's something you love.

It was also involved in producing Ebola tests for Africa.
