 WASHINGTON — Americans sorted themselves into two distinct camps of voters in Tuesday’s presidential election, exposing the clear and entrenched partisan divisions that separate voters by gender, class and race.
 Despite a once-in-a-century pandemic and a weakened economy, some 76% of U.S. voters said they knew all along who they would support — and they constituted the bulk of the supporters for both President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of the voters nationwide. Trump weighed heavily on voters' minds as they made their choice — two-thirds said their decision was driven by their opinion of the untraditional president, either for or against.

Any specific details regarding specification is unknown outside the battery capacity, so it's unclear where exactly this device will fit into Samsung's lineup. The Galaxy M11 had a 5000mah battery, yet a meager Snapdragon 450 with 3/4GB or RAM, and 32GB of storage to start, a far cry from some of the best low-cost smartphones on the market this year. The M12 could just be a follow- up to the M11, which was released back in May. With any luck, this model could have 5G on board, using one of Qualcomm's new mid-range 5G chips.

By Amit Kumar   New Delhi [India], November 5 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi will flag off the Ro-Pax ferry service from Hazira to Ghogha and inaugurate its terminal at Hazira, Surat, on November 8 under Sagarmala programme, a flagship water transport service project of the Shipping Ministry.   The Ghogha-Hazira Ro-Pax ferry service will work as a gateway to South Gujarat and the Saurashtra region, and reduce the distance between Ghogha and Hazira from 370 km to 90 km.   Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Laxmanbhai Mandaviya said that this service will make life easy, especially for the 20 lakh people of Saurashtra.   "Today, they have to travel around 400 km to come from Saurashtra to Surat. But once this service begins, they will only have to travel 60 km by the sea route," Mandaviya told ANI.  
 "A terminal has been built in Hazira and more than 500 passengers will be able to sit in the Ro-Pax ferry. It will have space for more than one hundred four- wheelers, including 35 trucks," he said.   The Ro-Pax ferry vessel, Voyage Symphony, is a three-deck vessel. It has a load capacity of 30 trucks (of 50 Million Tonnes each) on the main deck, 100 passengers cars on the upper deck and 500 passengers, along with 34 ship crew and hospitality staff on the passenger deck.   The Ro-Pax terminal, about 100 m in length and 40 m in width, has cost approximately Rs 25 crore. The terminal has an administrative office building, a parking area, substation and water tower among other facilities.   The reduced cargo travel time from 10 to 12 hours to about four hours will result in huge savings on fuel (approximately 9,000 litres per day) and lower the maintenance cost of vehicles drastically. It will also result in the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 24 MT per day and net saving of approximately 8,653 MT per annum.   The inauguration of the Ro-Pax terminal at Hazira will be a big step towards Prime Minister Modi's vision of harnessing waterways and integrating them with the economic development of the country.

La pioggia non ferma la rabbia dei ristoratori, gestori di bar e pub di Milano e provincia che si sono dati appuntamento a pochi passi dalla Prefettura di Milano per manifestare  la loro rabbia contro il nuovo decreto del governo che impone loro la chiusura alle 18.

Questo nuovo decreto "e peggio del lockdown - ha spiegato Alfredo Zini, ristoratore che ha promosso la protesta a Milano - ci sara cosi un mercato parallelo di abusivismo,  la gente potra acquistare alimentari e alcolici e consumarli anche abusivamente per la strada.

Washington [US], November 5 (ANI): Fearing a repetition of 2016 when the US became a victim of Russian interference, the American election officials are on high alert this year.   According to a report by The Hill, the election officials are cautiously declaring victory after no reports of major cyber incidents on Election Day.   "After millions of Americans voted, we have no evidence any foreign adversary was capable of preventing Americans from voting or changing vote tallies," Christopher Krebs, the director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), was quoted as saying in a statement Wednesday.   The Hill further reported that the election officials at all levels of government have been hyper-focused on the security of the voting process since 2016, when the nation was caught off-guard by a sweeping and sophisticated Russian interference effort that included targeting election infrastructure in all 50 states, with Russian hackers gaining access to voter registration systems in Florida and Illinois.   "I think while it's fantastic that yesterday was quiet, that tells you that the work is paying off. But we know the nature of the threats in the cybersecurity landscape don't go away, and you don't get to say, 'Oh, we're good.' You see the commitment and the effort and that has to continue," Election Assistance Commission Chairman Benjamin Hovland, who was nominated by President Trump, told The Hill.   In 2018, President Donald Trump had signed a law legislation creating CISA, which has now become the main agency coordinating with state and local election officials on security issues.   "It's like night and day....In 2016 the level of coordination was almost non- existent except in the immediate run-up to the election," said Edgardo Cortes, who served as the Virginia commissioner of elections four years ago.  
 Cortes further said, "The election yesterday went very well, the lead-up to yesterday and yesterday itself went very well, and I think it's a reflection of the ongoing effort that state and local election officials have put into election security, and the coordination that has developed at all levels of government."   Ahead of the 2020 US Presidential elections, the CISA had established a 24/7 operations center to help coordinate with state and local officials, along with social media companies, election machine vendors and other stakeholders, The Hill reported.   However, the threat of foreign interference still looms.   Quoting a senior CISA official, The Hill said the agency was watching for threats including disinformation, the defacement of election websites, distributed denial of service attacks on election systems and increased demand on vote reporting sites taking systems offline.   "The attack surface for disinformation and other foreign interference efforts extends well into the next month or two," the official said.   "There is no spiking the football here. We are acutely focused on the mission at hand. We are aggressively looking for any activity that could interfere with the election, and that is going to be our mission for the foreseeable future," the official added.   Americans cast their votes on November 3 to elect the next president of the world's oldest democracy. As part of the New York Times tally, Joe Biden is edging towards a victory over incumbent President Donald Trump in the fierce battle of the US Presidential elections with 253 projected Electoral College votes.

Missouri voters have passed a new redistricting measure that will override redistricting changes they adopted just two years ago. The 2018 “Clean Missouri” initiative required state House and Senate districts to be drawn to achieve “partisan fairness” and made Missouri the first state to adopt a specific formula known as the “efficiency gap” to measure fairness. The Republican-led Legislature put an alternative proposal on the ballot to drop partisan fairness and competitiveness to the bottom of the priority list for redistricting. It also abolishes the newly created position of a nonpartisan demographer to draft districts and instead makes a pair of bipartisan commissions responsible for that task, as they had been in the past.

Paper is most commonly used for wedding invites, but the material can’t always be recycled if it is embellished with glitter, glue or any other additional decorations — even glossy paper is a problem. The ink used can also be an issue, as petroleum inks contain toxic chemicals, so find a supplier who uses vegetable or soy-based inks as a sustainable alternative. Recycled paper or card is an eco-friendly option, as is bamboo paper. To cut out your paper usage altogether, and save money in the process, consider sending your invites by email, though bear in mind that older guests may not have internet access, or be well-versed in using computers. In this case, be sure to opt for suppliers with strong sustainability values for the few paper invitations you do send.

 There also were some notable losses for LGBTQ candidates.
 In Texas, Gina Ortiz Jones, a Democratic former Air Force intelligence officer who is lesbian, had been seen as having a strong chance of winning in a sprawling, 800-mile congressional district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso. The seat had been held by Rep. Will Hurd, the House’s only Black Republican, who opted not to seek re-election and endorsed Tony Gonzales, the GOP candidate who prevailed on Tuesday.
 And in southwestern Michigan’s 6th District, Jon Hoadley, seeking to become the state’s first openly gay congressman, lost to 17-term GOP Rep. Fred Upton.

 Associated Press writers Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Margaret Stafford in Across the nation, LGBTQ candidates achieved milestone victories in Tuesday’s election, including the first transgender person elected to a state Senate, and the first openly gay Black men to win seats in Congress.
 The landmark wins came not in only blue but also red states such as Tennessee, where Republican Eddie Mannis, who is gay, and Democrat Torrey Harris, who identifies as biusexual, won seats in the state House to become the first openly LGBTQ members of that legislature.
 According to the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which recruits and supports LGBTQ candidates, that leaves only Alaska, Louisiana and Mississippi as states that have never elected an LGBTQ legislator.
 “Torrey and Eddie sent a clear message that LGBTQ candidates can win in a deep red state while being their authentic selves,” said the Victory Fund’s president, former Houston Mayor Annise Parker. “Their presence in the state legislature can dilute the most toxic anti-LGBTQ voices and lead to more inclusive legislation.”
 In New York, attorney Mondaire Jones won in a district of New York City suburbs and Ritchie Torres, a member of the New York City Council, won in the Bronx to make history as the first gay Black men elected to the U.S. House. Both are Democrats; Torres identifies as Afro Latino.
 The two “will bring unique perspectives based on lived experiences never before represented in the U.S. Congress,” Parkerr said.
 With the addition of Jones and Torres, there will be nine openly LGBTQ members of the House as of January, The seven incumbents all won their races.
 In Delaware, Democrat Sarah McBride won her state Senate race with more than 70% of the vote and will become the first openly transgender state senator in the country.
 “It is my hope that a young LGBTQ kid here in Delaware or really anywhere in this country can look at the results and know that our democracy is big enough for them, too,” McBride said as her victory was confirmed Tuesday night.
 McBride interned at the White House under President Barack Obama and in 2016 became the first openly transgender person to give a speech at a major party convention.
 Two other Democrats became the first openly transgender people to win seats in their states' Houses: Taylor Small in Vermont and Stephanie Byers in Kansas.
 Byers, a retired high school band teacher, expressed hope that her victory would encourage other transgender people in conservative Kansas.
 “It helps those people who are transgender to reinforce that they are people who matter, they are people who are important and they’re people who can be successful in their lives,” she told The Wichita Eagle.
 Before Tuesday’s election, there were four other transgender lawmakers in state legislatures nationwide, according to the Victory Fund.

In the last two quarters, our portfolio was positioned more into defensives like consumer, IT and pharmaceutical type of businesses. We are trying to take some profits out of those companies and move into slightly more quality cyclicals, says Ayaz Motiwala, Senior Fund Manager, Nivalis Partners. As a Hong Kong-based fund manager, how did the last six months of Covid pandemic work for your portfolio? Did you churn your portfolio, did you buy the dip or were you just observing?In the lead up to the bottom as it has been called by the market in March and April, a lot of people including ourselves were very frozen in terms of how the markets were reacting to it and how the businesses would be affected. The market in the last week of March was not very discerning and all businesses were beaten down and indices were down. Over time, it became pretty apparent that some businesses will be less damaged or may be net beneficiaries of the Covid crisis and some would remain damaged and have a much later recovery. We in our own ways were trying to figure that out. We did have a couple of those types of businesses - -one being a mall operator. We decided to cut those positions as we could understand that these things may take some time to come out of the crisis. In hindsight, six months was the duration of the lockdown but that was not very apparent when the lockdown was initiated. Clearly the month of April and another 15 days of May things were really locked up and that showed in the Q1 performance of companies starting April. The Q2 numbers showed a pretty rapid movement towards normalcy. The market in its wisdom has treated that quarter as an exceptional quarter and moved on from there. The market presented an exceptional opportunity for people who had money on their disposal and the courage to pull the trigger somewhere between the middle of March and the end of March and then another sort of dip somewhere in the last couple of weeks of May. But barring that. the market has been on a move to decipher businesses which are net beneficiaries and businesses which are going to take a long time to recover from the Covid period. Clearly, some of the consumer businesses have been net beneficiaries as work from home and stay at home and cook at home have meant demand for cooking aid condiments, noodles, butter, cheese, sauces, biscuits and what have you. These are some of these businesses which have really benefited out of people not eating street food. In the first phase, dine-in was a big challenge. Restaurants were shut, deliveries were shut and then over time, deliveries have opened up and societies which have blocked out and people have permitted that. What have you been researching lately? What kind of changes are there on your drawing board as far as your portfolio is concerned?In the last two quarters, our portfolio was positioned more into defensives like consumer, IT and pharmaceutical type of businesses. We are trying to take some profits out of those companies and move into slightly more quality cyclicals. We are scaling some of our existing positions in auto and auto parts. We are looking at other businesses which are derivatives of a steel cycle or mining. There are some very interesting niche sort of businesses which may be slightly small and midcap in character but they have an appeal for us and so we have added to some of those businesses, including an indirect play in the recovery of industrial activity and the power sector. For the next 3-5-year period, what is your hypothesis for markets?The backdrop is very interesting we have had a pretty ordinary sort of Nifty EPS growth environment, not only the recent three years which have been pretty tough with a lot of macro external events but even in the last five, seven years, there has been 4-5% Nifty growth. The point here I am trying to make is that the market has gravitated towards a shrinking universe of growth companies because we are looking at India as a growth market and that universe has shrunk over time. It has come down to the troika of the FMCG, pharma and IT businesses and a few financial services stocks. At every juncture, investors including ourselves have put down these bets hoping that there is an order book recovery, there is an industrial capex cycle, there is a sharper and a longer duration rural growth story and quite a few of these expectations have been belied in the last three to five years. We are indeed placing bets on the hopes that the cycle is going to turn around and maybe the Covid- related shock has been taken very positively by entrepreneurs and they have stepped up capacity. We are hearing about capital investment plans by a lot of corporates from diverse sectors in cyclicals and industrials such as cement and steel. You have been adding auto ancillaries and chemical stocks for some time. Are you seeing more value in midcaps and smallcaps at this juncture? We have been very happy beneficiaries of the move for EPS generation by these companies and the market has been rewarding them with excellent share price performance over the last three-five years. Atul, Vinati Organics and a host of other names have made a lot of money for ourselves and investors. That being said, the commentary on China plus one and others making a certain discourse is an appeal for may be others, but we are happy to have taken some money off the table. We think some of these stocks are appreciably ahead of their times in terms of where valuation should be and where earnings are expected to come. So that is in one particular sector that you asked about. What kind of chats are you having with some of your portfolio companies?In the first quarter, the commentary was clearly both in private conversations and in post result commentary or conference calls where managements called out extreme focus on cost control and the generation of cash and cutting down of discretionary expenditure such as advertising, travel. That has gradually shifted towards opening up businesses as unlock one, two and more have come about. Businesses are now focussed on reaching a lower sustainable level of cost structure but are focussed on growing their top lines. They want to get the salesmen out in the field as much as is permitted. They want to reach out to customers in the existing channels and in newer forms. Lots of small and big companies on the softer consumer side of the business have launched a slew of new products and categories with health and hygiene as the big focus. What kind of numbers are you looking at in your portfolio, in terms of earnings growth 12 to 24 months far out?. Eventually the portfolio growth will follow earnings. What kind of alpha can be generated there?During the first quarter. It seemed the whole FY21 ending in March 21 would be a wash out and an off year. But clearly some of our portfolio companies have actually come in and reported pretty decent numbers in the first quarter and then further growth in the second quarter. On aggregate, it may be still tougher because not all companies have done that. A couple of companies are indeed affected and their earnings may have declined by 20- 40% and a sharper recovery in FY22. We feel that earnings growth on an average across the portfolio should be in the high teens and we hope that the market takes note of this and there is growth ahead of that in FY23 and beyond and we sort of make share price returns a function of that.

The European Union has reiterated its call on the Israeli government to halt all such demolitions, including of EU-funded structures, in particular in light of the humanitarian impact of the current coronavirus pandemic The EU on Thursday called on Israel to cease demolishing Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank and lift a threat to demolish Palestinian schools, calling them 'an impediment towards the two-state solution'. The statement, issued by the spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, came two days after Israeli bulldozers razed a Bedouin village near Tubas in the Jordan Valley, leaving its nearly 80 inhabitants homeless. The EU statement said that half the Palestinians made homeless in the demolition were children. 'This large-scale demolition confirms once again the regrettable trend of confiscations and demolitions since the beginning of the year,' it said. It added that Israel has also threatened to raze 52 Palestinian schools, including one in Ras Al-Teen in the West Bank that was co-funded by the EU member states. 'The EU calls for the protection of children, including ensuring their right to education in a safe and secure school environment,' the statement said, noting that education is a basic human right. 'The EU reiterates its call on Israel to halt all such demolitions, including of EU- funded structures, in particular in light of the humanitarian impact of the current coronavirus pandemic,' it said.

As the editor noted, it didn't seem particularly fair for AMD to share its first official peeks at performance with overclocking applied.

O’Laughlin has made himself such a player.
 And it is an unlikely story of how it came about.
 O’Laughlin was a star receiver at Fenwick High, a Catholic high school in the Chicago area.
 “Not a lot of Midwestern kids come out here to the mountains,” O’Laughlin said. “I came for a visit. I loved the fan base, loved the culture, loved what it was about. I fell in love with it right away on one of my first official visits. They showed me the town and I saw the blue-collar mentality and it was something I loved.”
 So, he made the decision to come to WVU and brought a lot of football tradition with him from Fenwick HIgh, which was where one-time Notre Dame running back Johnny Lattner went to high school, graduating in 1950.
 And he also found himself following in another set of famous footsteps belonging to Steelers linebacker Robert Spillane, who this past week intercepted a Lamar Jackson pass and set up the Steelers’ victory over arch- rival Baltimore by running it in for a touchdown.
 “I think I was in the eighth grade when he was playing his last year in high school but my mom worked at the school and I knew I was going there,” O’Laughlin said. “I used to go to all the high school games. I watched him when I was really young and it gave me inspiration to work hard to make it to the next level.
 “Seeing Spillane do that, watching him on TV wearing his grandfather’s number — his grandfather was Lattner and his Heisman Trophy is displayed at our high school. There’s just a lot of history there and I’ve been in contact with him a little bit and he’s been a great help giving me tips to get through college and become a good football player.”
 But his college career was put on hold before it ever got started.
 “I think this is his first year where he’s had a fighting chance,” Coach Neal Brown. “He was 205 pounds when he got here, tore his ACL in his first practice, the way I understand it. He had to redshirt, came back last year and kind of got forced into action and was really fighting an uphill battle all year.”
 It wasn’t easy for him.
 There was rehab from the injury, learning a new position, growing into a new body that now is a strong 255 pounds.
 “The change was crazy, really,” he said. “You have to figure how the football movements work at 255 pounds.”
 When he was ready to play WVU’s offense wasn’t ready then for a tight end and he wasn’t ready to play it, but he now is nearing the end of his transformation from long, lean wide receiver to someone who can handle all that is thrown at a tight end.
 “Now, he’s in a position with his body weight and strength where he can compete week in and week out,” Brown said. “He’s always had great ball skills. He’s always been a guy that’s good after the catch, so he continues to do that. Now he’s doing a really good job in the run game and the pass protection.
 “Not only him, but TJ Banks has given us quality snaps all year as well.”
 The result is that WVU now has a variety in its offense that it lacked a year ago.
 “Moving them around and using a little more tempo lately has made a difference,” said offensive coordinator Gerad Parker. “We can run tempo and keep them on the field. O’Laughlin makes us more versatile, we are able to do things with him detached from the formation as well as attached that we hope continues to create issues for the defense. They both can play in space and in the box.”
 Last week it was particularly evident as O’Laughlin caught two third down passes for first downs, giving the defense a lot to think about in such situations.

The hope for a clear winner in the presidential race was dashed when Americans awoke Wednesday morning to an ongoing election that could be uncertain for days and even weeks.
 Millions of votes were still being counted and the races in key swing states were still too close to call as of midday Wednesday.
 However, the financial markets, which are notoriously averse to uncertainty, have taken the news in stride. Led by the tech giants, the Nasdaq surged almost 4.5% while the S&P and the Dow rose 3.4% and 2.9%, respectively, in midday Wednesday trading.
 "What we're seeing today is mainly some relief that the Senate is not going blue," said Giorgio Caputo, a senior portfolio manager at the $36.2 billion J O Hambro Capital Management.
 "So you're seeing technology having a very strong bid. You're seeing healthcare stocks perform well. You're seeing infrastructure companies doing a little worse," he said in an interview. "With the Senate staying red at least for the next two years, any meaningful tax increases are off the table and that seems to be getting priced into the market today."
 For Margie Patel, a senior portfolio manager at the $578 billion Wells Fargo Asset Management, the stocks are not only pricing in a gridlock scenario but also sending out a clear signal.
 "I think the markets for the last two days and then today is really believing that Trump will finally get the nod when they count all the ballots," Patel, a 47-year investing veteran, said in an interview.
 She added: "Looking at the House and Senate races, which haven't got nearly as much attention, looks as if there isn't any major change... It doesn't look like there's a lot of uncertainty there so no change is good news for the market too."

As a result, the so-called battleground or swing states take far greater precedence when it comes to campaigning—since all that matters are the 270 electoral votes required for victory. Many states are all-but guaranteed to vote for one party or another. It doesn’t matter if you voted for Trump in New York or for Biden in Mississippi—your vote will have zero effect on the outcome. This also means that the 80% of the population living in non- battleground states are often simply taken for granted. This blew up in Hillary Clinton’s face in 2016. She didn’t visit Wisconsin even once, since she was so confident that those votes were in the bag—and she ended up losing there. Little wonder that a majority of Americans support abolishing the Electoral College outright! Yet all of this is considered perfectly normal and legitimate by liberal and conservative politicians and pundits alike.

New Delhi [India], November 5 (ANI/NewsVoir): The latest entrant in the Indian luxury hotel space, The Postcard Hotel walks away with multiple honours at The World Travel Awards, 2020.   The Postcard Dewa, Thimphu has been voted as 'Asia's Leading Luxury Boutique Hotel' and 'Bhutan's Leading Boutique Hotel', The Postcard Cuelim, South Goa has been voted as 'India's Leading Boutique Hotel' and 'Goa's Leading Boutique Hotel' and The Postcard Velha, Old Goa has been voted as 'India's Best Wellness Retreat'. In just a year of being operational, the brand has managed to make a mark for itself amongst the top luxury hotels in Asia.   Kapil Chopra and a team of experienced hospitality professionals founded The Postcard Hotel with a vision to open experiential luxury hotels in unique destinations. The immersive hospitality and its unconventional and fluid nature is what truly sets the brand apart.   No set breakfast hours, personalised exclusive dining, cocktails on arrival and the flexibility of anytime check-in and check-out are some of the unique offerings that have contributed to the vast recognition and appreciation of the brand.   "Evolving rapidly and staying positive in this new environment was the need of the hour. While our hotels continued to provide the highest levels of service and genuine care for our guests, enhancing the procedures and protocols for safety of our guests and team became our priority. Additionally, to ensure that they feel safe and reassured, The One Key Hotel was introduced," said Chopra.   The 'One Key' access is a unique service that allows guests to book the entire hotel for themselves, during which the property is completely closed off to non-residential guests with a complete sanitisation of the premises including the pool prior to arrival.   The boutique nature of The Postcard properties and their polished safety and service standards is what contributed to their success post-opening after the nationwide lockdown this year. With limited inventory and plenty of outdoor spaces, social distancing is naturally inbuilt in the way the hotels are designed, with enough space for each guest to feel secluded and enjoy their own private experiences.   This has led to possibly the biggest success story globally for any brand with revenue for the current year already exceeding last year's - buoyed by an increased occupancy and high average room rates.  
 Each hotel by The Postcard offers unique experiences that are true to its surroundings, giving guests a sense of the neighbourhood and the destination in a way never seen before. The Postcard Cuelim, is a 350 year old restored estate located in South Goa. This six room hotel overlooking 3500 acres of lush green paddy fields seamlessly blends in with Goa's rich culture and tropical radiance, providing the experience of seclusion and disconnect.   The Postcard Dewa, Thimphu is nestled in a forest on the outskirts of Bhutan's capital city. The newly built hotel with 15 suites and a minimum room size of 995 square feet is located with a spectacular hilltop view of the Thimphu valley and surrounding forests. Just a 20-minute drive from Thimphu city's sights and sounds, the hotel aims to provide a sense of splendid seclusion.   As the only carbon negative country in the world, 72 per cent of Bhutan is forest covered, and The Postcard is a perfect base from which one can explore the magnificent landscape and culture of Bhutan.   The Postcard Hotel is committed to opening a multitude of new hotels in hidden holiday destinations across India and the globe. The Postcard, Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, The Postcard on the Arabian Sea, Karnataka and The Postcard in the Himalayas, Mashobra are expected to open first amongst their planned openings in 2021. "Travellers today are receptive and eager.   They're not simply satisfied with stunning sceneries, but also want to expand their cultural knowledge and grow as individuals- Gir provides the option of a great wildlife experience and an opportunity to sight the majestic Lion," said Kapil Chopra, Founder and CEO, The Postcard Hotel.   "Untouched locations that allow people to get away from their urban lifestyles and reconnect with nature is what the affluent traveller is looking for. For those wanting a coastal experience that is slightly off the beaten track, the Maravanthe coast in Karnataka is one of the most picturesque coastal stretches in India. As Indian travellers start looking for new domestic destinations, the more pristine areas in the Himalayas will also come into vogue. I see Mashobra having the benefit of easy accessibility and close proximity to Shimla, along with the sense of being cut off from the crowds," he added.   Kapil Chopra along with a team of luxury hoteliers founded The Postcard Hotel on a mission to create extraordinary experiences for discerning travellers. Launched in December 2018, The Postcard Hotel is a bold and ambitious brand committed to creating new rules and setting new standards in experiential luxury. It launched in Goa and successfully operates 3 resorts in the destination - The Postcard Moira,   The Postcard Velha and The Postcard Cuelim. In the beginning of 2020, the brand marked its international presence in Bhutan and Sri Lanka - The Postcard Dewa, Thimphu and The Postcard Galle respectively. The brand is resolute in its dedication to crafting stunningly designed hotels, preserving local authenticity from design to cuisine, all the while offering impeccable service in 50 intimate hotels in 5 years.

Ed ecco che qui arriviamo all’Italia. Salvini sino alla vigilia del voto, ha esibito persino in Parlamento il berretto o la mascherina con il nome di Trump. Ha previsto con intelligenza la sua rimonta, oppure ha voluto manifestargli il massimo della devozione nella buona e nella cattiva sorte. O entrambe le cose. Certo, ha fatto qualcosa che nessun politico del mondo ha fatto. E che non si sarebbe sognato neppure Boris Johnson (il più legato a Trump e considerato un suo clone). Per il massimo del sovranismo, come quello professato da Salvini, è una contraddizione curiosa manifestare contestualmente il massimo della sudditanza a un capo politico pur sempre straniero. E contrapporre invece la sovranità italiana alla comunità di Bruxelles che completamente straniera non è, perché ne facciamo parte e vi abbiamo voce in capitolo. Ma Salvini ha fatto un investimento a lungo termine. Sa infatti che il combustibile del Trumpismo è comunque dovunque un patrimonio elettorale enorme. Ancor più nei Paesi, come proprio l’Italia, dove tre elementi di tale miscela combustibile sono più presenti che altrove: la vecchiaia, il basso livello di istruzione, l’ostilità verso una politica inaffidabile.

"I guess the biggest (second-half) adjustment was our mentality and telling everybody to forget about what happened in the first half. It's done, it's over with and you can't go back and change it."
 Kobe Lewis ran for 112 yards and two touchdowns on 28 carries to lead the Chippewa ground game. He and Darius Bracy recorded a number of carries out of the wildcat formation.
 "With D-Rich, this being his first start, we didn't want to put him in too many awkward situations," said Lewis, a junior, who said he had not run the ball out of the wildcat formation since high school. "We took a load off for him. It really helped him out today."
 Not that D-Rich, who posted video-game-like numbers as a high school phenom in Miami, Fla., necessarily needed it. But it certainly helped as the Chippewas held a nine-plus-minute advantage in possession time.
 "He played well," Lewis said. "I was so proud of him. He stepped up and played like a veteran today; he didn't play like a rookie at all. He played like he was comfortable; he played like he had been here before."
 Richardson and the Chippewa offense was impressive right off the bat, marching 75 yards in 16 plays on the game's opening drive and taking a 7-0 lead on Richardson's 1-yard TD sneak.
 That touched off an entertaining first half that was filled with big plays and ended in a 20-20 tie. De'Montre Tuggle broke the tie by returning the second- half kickoff 93 yards for a score to put Ohio up 27-20.
 But after that, the CMU defense took center stage and the Chippewa run game did enough to get the job done.

 "All in all let's just be really happy about the win. Let's look at it tonight and tomorrow and make the proper corrections and get ready to go on the road and play next week (at Northern Illinois)."

 Advertising sales have been unpredictable as companies slashed ad budgets to cope with a sharp drop in business due to cronavirus-led lockdowns.
 Revenue from subscription rose 12.6per cent to US$300.95 million in the third quarter, while ad revenue dropped 30.2per cent to US$79.25 million, the company said.
 Total revenue fell 0.4per cent to US$426.9 million, but came in above analysts' estimates of US$411.8 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

“We couldn’t transport people the way we usually do from the farm back to Fairmont because we couldn’t have that many people in a van at one time,” Burns said. “It was impossible really this summer to do any kind of cooking classes the way we normally do.”
 Burns is already getting bids so construction can begin on the project, which has an April completion target.
 “We’re getting bids right now,” Burns said. “I’ve got two bids on the way for the actual building and I’ve got four bids from talking to different local contractors. We hope to have this building up and running by the first of April.”
 Sole said the two-time success of the project in the Neighborhood Assist program is all thanks to the people who support the Homestead Farm Center and the DAC.
 “We submitted our cause, but this was truly our supporters, our friends, our family, our community getting behind us to do this,” Sole said. “We knew we had a great cause, but there were 200 great causes all over the country. What brought this to life was the voters.”
 Sole said already the progress made at Homestead Farm Center has improved the experience of the people who use its facilities, and that progress will be developed further by phase two of this project.
 “It’s really a one-of-a-kind program for people with disabilities,” Sole said. “The learning environment we’re creating out there and the home away from home that this has created for our clients is just absolutely amazing.
 “For people with disabilities to have this type of facility where they can go and garden and learn about agriculture and animals, it’s really an amazing feat.”
 Burns agreed, and said she is excited for the clients and the people of north central West Virginia to see this project completed.
 “We needed this two years ago,” Burns said. “We’re going to go right ahead with it and it will be on the ground by spring. We’re really excited.”

As a result, we don’t feel the desperation, the hopelessness of Pete’s situation. Really, it’s a reminder of what an accomplishment Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed” is: How we sweat bullets along with the undercover protagonist during every beat of the way in that Oscar winner. Obviously, that’s unfair. Not every movie in the genre has to be on that level. But the experience of “The Informer” would be more affecting if we were more worried for its main character. Or if we felt the danger of his being behind bars again, or tension that he might be unmasked. There aren’t exactly any white-knuckle moments in the film.
 Actresses of the caliber of De Armas (so good in “Knives Out”) and Pike (an Oscar nominee for “Gone Girl” who also deserved consideration for “A Private War”) feel wasted in thankless roles. It would have been nice to see more of Common’s character, but he disappears for a while. Kinnaman is just fine. Owen is in danger of being associated with too many sneering-bad-guy roles.
 “The Informer” provides little more than a short-duration crime-drama fix.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Police fatally shot a man who hit a detective's car with the butt of a rifle before pointing it at them in Jacksonville late Wednesday night, officials said. Detectives G.A. Taylor and M.L. Mullis were in a car waiting for other officers to join them in investigating a gang when a man walked up to the passenger side carrying a rifle, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief T.K. Waters said in a news conference early Thursday. The man then hit the car with the rifle “He pointed it at our officers,” Waters said. “The officers exited and fired several shots and struck that subject. At that point he went down.” Detectives rendered first-aid until paramedics took him to a hospital. He later died of his wounds. Waters said investigators don't know why the man approached the vehicle. The state attorney's office is investigating. It was the first officer-involved shooting for both men, Waters said. He did not say whether the officers were using body cameras. The name of the man has not been released.

When Stan stretches a line of credit too thin with suavely suited gangster Pepper (Jonathan Majors), he lands the brothers in a strange pickle. The young men have to go west, to San Francisco, for a bare-knuckle boxing match called “Jungleland.” Win the fight, erase the debt. The only catch? Pepper saddles Stan with another delivery: Drop a young woman by the name of Sky (Jessica Barden) at a pet supply store in Reno in the care of a man named Yeats, a transaction to which Sky is vehemently opposed.
 This dire and dreamy road movie is impressive work from director and co-writer Winkler (he co-wrote with Theodore Bressman and David Branson Smith). His third feature (after 2010’s “Ceremony” and 2017’s “Flower”) shows Winkler to be expanding the scope and genre of his work while remaining tightly focused on character.
 That focus makes this an actor’s picture, with a trio of English actors tackling working-class American dreamers, to remarkable results. Hunnam excels in roles that utilize his gift of gab and natural, almost ingratiating charm, and O’Connell disappears into the role of the stoic, strong and loyal Lion. Barden holds her own against the two as the enigmatic Sky.
 Shot with heightened naturalism by cinematographer Damián García, certain images are incredibly striking, seemingly plucked out of the existing landscape, especially from authentic locations in Fall River, Mass., Reno, Nev., and San Francisco. Winkler and editor Tomas Vengris build a rhythm that ebbs and flows, sound overlapping image to push the pace, and occasionally allowing it to grind to a halt, observing how tensions rise on this increasingly disastrous journey.

 Voters indicated they supported Biden on policy and character issues, but specific topics were more likely to drive them to one candidate or another – people who were focused on the economy, by and large, were more likely to vote for Trump; those whose top issue was the pandemic response probably went for Biden, Yost said.
 He provided two examples. A rather cliché poll question – who would you rather have a beer or coffee with? – revealed that Trump still had some intangible quality that drew even voters that didn’t plan to vote for him. A second question revealed that Trump had a more enthusiastic base – 82% of likely Trump voters said their vote was for the incumbent, while 48% of likely Biden voters said that their vote wasn’t for Biden as much as it was against Trump.

No question, October is the most striking and colorful month. Still, I think a close second is November. Yes, November. Certainly, in early November some trees are at, or have yet to reach, peak fall color. I’m looking at several hickories now, still full of leaves, that deep mustard yellow. Low-growing, flowering and red osier dogwoods around home have dropped just a few leaves and those remaining are that deep maroon.
 Above and beyond, all the oaks are coming into their autumn own with reds, from scarlet to maroon to rusty. There is just enough green mottling in some oak leaves to add a nice contrast and give a nod to the summer sun that produced deep greens and all that energy big oaks hold.
 Down low in woodlands, open meadows and wetlands, grasses and flowers are mostly seed-bearing, their leaves also producing fall yellows and reds. Their stems, now shedding leaves, add their own colors that tree trunks do not, yellow, gold, bronze, even bluish and purple haze.
 Most flowers are done, but the few that remain, are eye catching in a world turning dark with earth tones. I walk about our prairie gardens and take note of new plants that appeared this year, those that were more robust, those that flowered well, and those that did not. Every year is different and springtime visions, following prescribed burns, planting native plugs, and pulling unwanted invasives, are now joyfully realized on November saunters and surveys of the home landscape.
 While some plants may not have performed their best, none are a disappointment. They are plants and they respond differently to environmental factors. We provide the best setting for native plants and their natural communities to thrive. Each November we take stock on what worked, what could have been better. No disappointments, just differences in degrees of success.
 I’m enamored every November at those few individual plants that for some reason found enough energy after a full year of sun to finally push some late autumn blooms. In a prairie patch along our lane, most all flowers have gone to seed, and their seeds even spent. There is one gray-headed coneflower, however, with four blooms that looks July fresh! Why was this one plant delayed when its neighbors have long since bloomed and their gray heads now with black seeds, have been picked by birds, or just dropped to the ground?
 Asters are the final flowers to cast their light at the end of the growing season. There is a small white aster and the New England aster still hanging on in the prairie plantings further out in the wilds. The former has white, nickel-sized blooms with small yellow centers, and tend to fade into the background. The latter though, is quarter-sized, also with a center disk of small yellow petals, but with long blue to bluish-purple ray petals.
 This New England aster shouts, “Look at me, I’m the last!” And look at them I do, but it wasn’t until I recently read how their petals tend to curl up and close at night that I take a second look. The author pointed out that when cold-blooded insects find it difficult to fly as temperatures drop, they may hunker down on a flower until the next day’s sun warms them again. Since asters tend to curl their petals at night, they become a great spot for some insects to take a snooze!
 Now November, most insects are into their life cycle strategies to survive the winter. Few adults are active. I’m taking note, though, for next September’s cool nights. I’ll be checking out these asters for any bees, bugs or beetles bedding down for the night.
 For now, our New England asters are the last to bloom, soon to seed, senesce, and wait for next year. I will enjoy them these first few weeks of November. When their blue flame flickers out, we say goodnight autumn.

China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Thursday, as its core e-commerce business continued to grow following China's emergence from coronavirus lockdowns. The results come on the heels of China's surprise suspension of Alibaba affiliate Ant Group's record $37 billion Shanghai listing that was viewed by analysts and investors as an attempt to cut founder Jack Ma and his financial services empire down to size. Alibaba's results also coincide with U.S. presidential election results, with Democrat Joe Biden edging closer to victory. Under Donald Trump's presidency, the world's top two economies have clashed often over trade, forcing many Chinese companies to put off U.S. listings or return to exchanges close to home. Revenue at Alibaba's cloud computing business, a focus area for the company, jumped 60 per cent to 14.9 billion yuan. Sales from Alibaba's core e-commerce business rose 29 per cent to 130.92 billion yuan in the reported quarter. Net income slumped 63 per cent to 26.52 billion yuan, as the company had booked a one-time gain last year from its 33 per cent equity interest in Ant Group. Revenue rose 30 per cent to 155.06 billion yuan in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to estimates of 154.74 yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company's U.S.-listed shares, which have gained about 39 per cent this year, fell 1.8 per cent in trading before the bell.

Since March, coronavirus restrictions have shut down critical elements of San Francisco’s vibrant economy. Tourists are scarce, and legions of workers in tech and in the city’s main business and financial districts have left to work remotely. Office vacancy rates went up while rents in the prohibitively expensive city dropped to their lowest in years.
 “The middle of a pandemic-fueled shutdown is the wrong time to raise taxes,” said Jim Wunderman, president and CEO of the business advocacy group Bay Area Council. “The drip, drip, drip of new general taxes is going to erode the already shaky foundations of local economies decimated by the worst downturn in generations.”
 The CEO tax is expected to generate between $60 million to $140 million per year. Haney said he wants most of the money directed towards health services. He dismisses fears that the surcharge will drive companies out of the city, saying the tax is modest in comparison to the cost of moving a business.

If all goes to plan, this academic year at the University of Idaho won’t lack football.
 The Big Sky Conference on Wednesday announced its spring season, unveiling a six-game league-only schedule for each of its 12 participating members.
 “We’re excited. It’s just great to know who you’re playing,” said eighth-year UI coach Paul Petrino, whose team will play three home games and three on the road.
 Highlighted opponents for the Vandals, who open Feb. 27, include regional rivals Idaho State, Eastern Washington and Montana.
 “I think it’s always special anytime you can keep playing teams and have a rivalry that just builds more and more each year,” Petrino said.
 The season will conclude April 17 with one of two conference-wide bye weeks, added because of the coronavirus to allow for potential make-up games.
 “We can’t predict the future of what it’s gonna look like when we do want to play, but we wanted to give ourselves flexibility within the schedule,” said Big Sky commissioner Tom Wistrcill on The Press Box podcast with Larry Weir. “We thought the bye weeks were important in case there’s an outbreak at one of our schools.”
 UI’s schedule features two teams — Montana and EWU — that finished ranked in last year’s Football Championship Subdivision polls.
 Big Sky competitors most likely will need at least a 5-1 record to qualify for the reduced, 16-team FCS spring postseason.
 Even so, the Vandals have some reason to like their odds. On paper, their 2021 schedule is among the conference’s least-formidable.
 They begin play at the Kibbie Dome hosting Northern Colorado, which is 7-26 in the past three seasons. The Bears, who upset Idaho 27-24 in Greeley, Colo., in 2019, welcome a first-year coach in former All-NFL Denver Broncos receiver Ed McCaffrey.
 UI then will visit in-state foe Idaho State on March 6 at Holt Arena. The Vandals stomped the Bengals 45-21 in Moscow last season after sustaining a 62-28 rout in Pocatello the previous year — UI’s first back in the Big Sky since 1995. ISU went 3-9 last season.
 The Vandals entertain Portland State on March 13. The Vikings blanked an injury-plagued UI 24-0 last year at Hillsboro Stadium. Like Idaho, PSU finished 5-7.
 After a Week 4 bye, UI and rival EWU square off March 27 on the Roos Field Inferno in Cheney, Wash. In their most recent meeting, at the Kibbie Dome in September 2019, Idaho posted a 35-27 defeat of the No. 11 Eagles — its best win since rejoining the conference.
 EWU dismantled visiting UI 38-14 in 2018.
 “Both (ISU and EWU), it’s been 1-1 the last two years, so I think that builds the rivalry even that much more,” Petrino said.
 The Vandals will stage an April 3 matchup with longtime adversary Montana for the 82-year-old Little Brown Stein traveling trophy.
 UI has been outscored 88-44 in its most recent back-to-back losses to the Griz. Although the Vandals own a 55-29-2 all-time record against UM, they haven’t claimed the Stein since 1999.
 “Montana’s a big game for us ... we gotta start making that a rivalry,” Petrino said. “We need to start competing better and get a win.”
 Idaho closes its season April 10 against Southern Utah in Cedar City, Utah. In 2018, the second meeting between the schools, the Vandals handled the Thunderbirds 31-12 in Moscow.
 SUU has gone 4-19 since winning a share of the Big Sky title in 2017.
 “It just gives you a little more momentum knowing exactly who you’re playing, and you can start planning everything,” said Petrino, whose Vandals are nearing the end of a 15-practice fall camp.
 The FCS playoffs, which generally field 24 teams, are planned to begin April 24. Postseason hopefuls will know their fates April 18. The playoffs will run four consecutive weeks, ending with the title game May 15 at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas.
 Wistrcill said preserving rivalries and cutting down on travel — to alleviate financial issues — weighed into the decisions. Week 1 contests will be played in either indoor stadiums or warmer climates to mitigate concerns with weather. The conference sought to provide a fair schedule, talent-wise, too.
 UI previously had top-10 Montana State, Northern Arizona and UC Davis on its eight-game league schedule. Northern Colorado filled in as a replacement.
 The Big Sky landed on six games because it’s aiming to conduct a fall season next year, and doesn’t intend to wear down student-athletes.
 Conference officials still need to determine what happens in the case of tiebreakers, Wistrcill said.
 “My guess is it might be a little messy as we get towards the end,” he said. “With the parity in our league, I wouldn’t want to predict what could happen there. We could have a bunch of teams with one loss, so who knows?”
 An even field of 12 was made possible when Sacramento State announced in September it would not compete this season.
 Game times and broadcast channels have yet to be announced. Fan attendance is up to each institution and state/local health authorities to determine.
 “A lot has to happen between now and then, but we feel good that where we landed is the best place for the entire conference,” Wistrcill said, later adding: “While the schedule is done, some of the work has only just begun, and we’ll continue that process as we go along.”

While couples always book the venue for a wedding, there are many more things you can hire for the day, including everything from the wedding attire like the dress, bridesmaid dresses and tuxedos for the groom, to decorations, furniture and restrooms. Hiring is an especially sustainable method to pick up glasses and crockery, bridal accessories and photo booth props, which ensures that items will get used multiple times, instead of being thrown away after the event. It can also help you to cut costs too, saving you from having to pay full whack for certain items by just handing over a hire fee instead.

“The October PMI data signalled a renewed contraction in business activity across the Russian service sector. The decline was driven by weaker demand conditions, as a resurgence in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and restrictions weighed on new sales,” Markit said. “New orders from abroad continued to fall as key export destinations also re-imposed tighter virus- related measures. As a result, pressure on capacity remained subdued, and firms cut their workforce numbers further. At the same time, pandemic uncertainty dragged expectations down, as service providers were their least optimistic of a rise in output over the coming year for five months.”

Why don’t people respect the law?
 That was among the questions President Trump’s policing commission, launched in January, was tasked with answering. This administration being what it is, and these times being what they are, it seems perfectly fitting that the commission itself broke the law — broke it so completely, in fact, that the day before the election a federal judge blocked it from ever releasing its report unless it included glaring language near the top advising readers that the contents were a product of a panel that was unlawfully constituted and operated.
 Or, in the alternative, it can start over, this time with more representative membership and more open proceedings.
 The takeaway is that any discussion in the as-yet unreleased report of the Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice about why people don’t respect the law is likely to be fairly useless, because it was written for self-serving purposes by police and prosecutors operating behind closed doors without input from people with different experiences and backgrounds, in violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

The unsettled nature of the presidential race was reflective of a somewhat disappointing night for Democrats, who had hoped to deliver a thorough repudiation of Trump’s four years in office while also reclaiming the Senate to have a firm grasp on all of Washington. But the GOP held onto several Senate seats that had been considered vulnerable, including in Iowa, Texas, Maine and Kansas. Democrats lost House seats but were expected to retain control there.
 The high-stakes election was held against the backdrop of a historic pandemic that has killed more than 232,000 Americans and wiped away millions of jobs. The U.S. on Wednesday set another record for daily confirmed coronavirus cases as several states posted all-time highs.
 The candidates spent months pressing dramatically different visions for the nation’s future, including on racial justice, and voters responded in huge numbers, with more than 100 million people casting votes ahead of Election Day.
 Trump, in an extraordinary move from the White House, issued premature claims of victory — which he continued on Twitter Wednesday — and said he would take the election to the Supreme Court to stop the counting. It was unclear exactly what legal action he could try to pursue.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell discounted the president’s quick claim of victory, saying it would take a while for states to conduct their vote counts. The Kentucky Republican said Wednesday that “claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.”
 Vote tabulations routinely continue beyond Election Day, and states largely set the rules for when the count has to end. In presidential elections, a key point is the date in December when presidential electors met. That’s set by federal law.
 Dozens of Trump supporters chanting “Stop the count!” descended on a ballot- tallying center in Detroit, while thousands of anti-Trump protesters demanding a complete vote count took to the streets in cities across the U.S.
 Protests — sometimes about the election, sometimes about racial inequality — took place Wednesday in at least a half-dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle, Houston, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis and San Diego.
 Several states allow mailed-in votes to be accepted as long as they were postmarked by Tuesday. That includes Pennsylvania, where ballots postmarked by Nov. 3 can be accepted if they arrive up to three days later.
 Trump appeared to suggest those ballots should not be counted, and that he would fight for that outcome at the high court. But legal experts were dubious of Trump’s declaration. Trump has appointed three of the high court’s nine justices — including, most recently, Amy Coney Barrett.
 The Trump campaign on Wednesday pushed Republican donors to dig deeper into their pockets to help finance legal challenges. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, during a donor call, spoke plainly: “The fight’s not over. We’re in it.”

 Biden could take several pages from the detailed healthcare position paper issued by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) during her own campaign for her party’s presidential nomination, which she ended in March. Some of her proposals, indeed, found their way into Biden’s own healthcare plank.
 The centerpiece of Warren’s proposal was a transition to universal healthcare via Medicare for all. She would have given every American over 50 the right to join an expanded Medicare program and would make it free for children under 18 and families with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (or about $52,400 for a family of four).
 That would require congressional assent, so it would appear to be off the table with a GOP-controlled Congress. Biden, to be sure, wasn’t a fan of Medicare for all.

The group’s weekly protest turned into a presumptive celebration Wednesday with familiar chants of “Jackie Lacey Must Go” turning into “Jackie Lacey Will Go.” Hundreds of people stood outside the Hall of Justice as relatives of several people shot and killed by police took the stage, flanked by signs that read “Jackie Lacey Gone.” Lisa Hines, whose daughter, Wakiesha Wilson, died in LAPD custody in 2016, said she was delighted to see Lacey losing but also warned Gascón he would face protesters’ wrath if he didn’t live up to his promises to hold police accountable.
 In an interview Tuesday night, Lacey said she regretted that her relationship with activists had become so toxic, and said it was something she hoped to repair if elected to a third-term.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece’s coast guard towed a boat carrying 65 asylum-seekers to a port on the country's western coast after it was found to be in distress in the Ionian Sea, authorities said Thursday. The Migration and Asylum ministry said that 35 of those on board were from Turkey, 15 from Afghanistan and many of the others from Iraq. Fifty-seven had already applied for asylum in Greece, it said, adding that they would be transferred to refugee centers, while those who had no documentation would apply for asylum. Two people believed to be the boat’s crew members were sent to court. It was the second case this week of Greek authorities intercepting migrant boats off the western coast of Greece, where they were believed to be heading to neighboring Italy. On Wednesday, the coast guard said it received a call about a yacht in distress off the coast of the island of Corfu. Coast guard vessels picked up 25 people, including nine children, from the boat. The coast guard said the adults were arrested for violating immigration laws, while the children were placed in protective custody. Authorities were searching for three people believed to be part of a migrant smuggling ring.

They are doing the trick by modernising and playing with fabrics, techniques, colours and other ornamentations. Adorning the new stylised protection, most masks contains three layers, are very comfy and easy to take on and off. They provide a voice and are a perfect replacement for the normal N95 medical masks.   The masks crafted today have a modern twist with a touch of Indian heritage. This is just an extension to match the new modern and bridges the gap between protection and fashion.   Let’s make sure that while we walk the path of safety, we also show our loved ones that we care. And the easiest way to do that this Diwali would be through a gift that speaks so for itself. A present which says you are thinking about them, and not just their safety but their style as well.

Movies tend to dip into politics very readily since as anyone can imagine there's a virtual treasure trove of subjects within politics that actors can bring to life in a number of ways. When it comes to an election though one can easily imagine that the tricks and games that are played are going to be highlighted without fail. Whatever goes on in real life, and many people would be quick to state that there's plenty going on behind the scenes, actors, and directors, and screenwriters, are able to pick up on this in a big way and the result can usually be seen in how a movie turns out and how it affects the average individual when it comes to their individual reaction. Some people might actually become offended at how their political party or someone they follow and care about are represented, while others will simply take it at face value since it is entertainment and it is something that needs to be enjoyed or ignored depending on the preference of the individual. All in all, movies that deal with elections can be a lot of fun, but it's wise to not take them too seriously.

Aumentando ancora i ricoveri ordinari ed in terapia intensiva, la nostra rete ospedaliera sarà costretta ad ammainare bandiera. Occorre un bagno di umiltà con la capacità di chiedere aiuto e contributo a tutti, lavoratori, sindacati, parti sociali e politica, per assumere decisioni condivise e quanto più risolutive per affrontare la crisi economica e sanitaria, solo successivamente sarà il tempo del tirare le somme ognuno con le proprie responsabilità”

 Under a newly approved law, any company whose top executive earns 100 times more than its average worker will pay an extra 0.1% surcharge on its annual business-tax payment. If a CEO makes 200 times more than the average employee, the surcharge increases to 0.2%, and so on per multiple of 100.
 Voters also agreed to sweeping business-tax changes that will lead to a higher tax rate for many tech companies and a higher transfer tax on property sales valued between $10 million and $25 million.

The first third down pass had O’Laughlin showing how his new body works, running over a defender to get the first down. The second one saw him make a nifty spin move that looked a whole like he was back as that 205-pound wide receiver, allowing him to get extra yards and the first down.
 “That was an instinct thing that comes from the wide receiver days,” O’Laughlin said.
 Either way works.
 “Yards after the catch and not being taken down by one guy is the goal,” O’Laughlin said.
 He has 10 catches so far this season, averaging 11.5 yards a catch and has earned the trust of the coaches and his quarterback, Jarret Doege.
 “Both have been doing a great job,” Doege said. “Both are really good blocking and when we get the ball they catch it and get yards.”

 No one will argue that this year’s West Virginia team is far improved over Neal Brown’s first team last year.
 But why?
 What stats on the offensive side of the ball would offensive coordinator Gerad Parker pick to illustrate that?
 “I would say this, we as a staff, from Coach Brown on down, we put a big emphasis on getting better in the red zone, on ball security and on running the ball,” Parker said.
 So how does the improvement look?
 Last year, touchdowns scored in the red zone, 16 in 34 trips, 47.0%. This year, 20 of 26 trips, 76.9%.
 Scoring a field goal or TD in the red zone last year, 25 scores in 34 trips, 73.5%. This year, 25 of 26 trips, 96.2%.
 Turnovers per game last year, 2.1. This year it’s down to 1.3.
 Rushing yards per game last year, 73.3. This year it’s nearly 100 more yards per game at 172 yards per game.
 Parker adds one other stat.
 “Points per game is always there,” he said.
 Last year that was 20.6 points per game. This year that’s up to 33 points a game, almost two touchdowns more per game.
 That’s dramatic progress.

In a delicate pushback against Trump’s own premature claims of victory over Joe Biden in the presidential race, the GOP leader said: “Claiming you’ve won the election is different from finishing the counting.”
 McConnell said he felt “pretty good” about the remaining contests. He secured a seventh term in a costly campaign, fending off Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot.
 Election night delivered a jarring outcome for Democrats who had devised an expanded political map, eager to counter Trump and his party’s grip on the Senate.
 While Democrats picked up must-win seats in Colorado and Arizona, they suffered a setback in Alabama, and Republicans held their own in one race after another — in South Carolina, Iowa, Texas, Kansas, Montana and Maine, dramatically limiting Democrats' hopes to make inroads.
 The races attracted an unprecedented outpouring of small-dollar donations for Democrats, from Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks to propel long-shot campaigns.
 The voters' choices will force a rethinking of Democratic Party strategy, messaging, and approach in the Trump era.
 “You wasted a lot of money,” said White House ally Sen. Lindsey Graham in Columbia, South Carolina, after defeating Jamie Harrison, despite the Democrat’s stunning $100 million haul for his upstart campaign. “This is the worst return on investment in the history of American politics.”
 Trump loomed large over the Senate races as did Democratic rival Joe Biden. The Trump administration’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic fallout, as well as the nation’s uneasy mood all seemed to be on the ballot.

In these days of the COVID 19 crisis, you may be washing your hands often and using hand sanitizers liberally. Actually, the hands tend to show neglect and ageing early, because the skin on the back of the hands is thin and has few oil glands. The constant use of soaps and the high alcohol content in hand sanitizers can cause excessive dryness, flaking and peeling of the skin.

Heading into election day, a popular worst-case-scenario narrative on Wall Street was a Biden win and a split Congress because the deadlock between Republicans and Democrats on another stimulus agreement would likely continue.
 Wednesday morning, it increasingly looked as if this would be the outcome as ballots continued to be counted in crucial states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan.
 And yet, markets were bullish -- the S&P 500 gained more than 3% during trading.
 That was because investors were realizing that this was the best long-term outcome for markets, according to Tom Mantione, a managing director for UBS private wealth management.
 "The market loves deadlock," Mantione told Business Insider on Wednesday. "Everybody doesn't necessarily like massive change, certainly market participants don't, because it becomes harder to forecast what that change will do to the economy and to companies."
 He added: "I don't necessarily understand the point of view that larger fiscal stimulus and massive tax change is positive for the market. Mathematically, it makes price-to-earnings multiples higher. I don't subscribe to that at all."
 Mantione said that while the market may suffer in the short term from a weak stimulus package, the outcome is most favorable for investors in the long term because a President Biden would not be able to pass higher corporate taxes with a Republican Senate.
 He added that a smaller stimulus package will create less inflation, and might lead to a slower but more sustainable economic recovery as it will force companies to be more conservative on their balance sheets.

 # Blue wave? Red wave? Election-night TV was more like a whirlpool.

 Very early on election night, CNN commentator Van Jones predicted, “You may get seasick tonight.”
 It was a rare accurate prediction on the evening, both medically and nautically. The night began with a wave of Trump red crashing across the coasts of Florida, hit by a crosscurrent from the West that buoyed Joe Biden’s campaign, forming a whirlpool of chaos and uncertainty. The president jumped on deck at the end of the night to rock the boat, and in the end, everyone could have used a Dramamine.

Ahead of the game at the Emirates Stadium the likes of Gabriel Magalhaes, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Kieran Tierney, and Mesut Ozil were put through their paces at the club's London Colney training base.
 And there was a situation between Lacazette and Arsenal's lead sports scientist Tom Allen.
 As spotted in a behind the scenes of Arsenal's training session video uploaded to YouTube, at around the 5.40-minute mark, the Frenchman is clearly upset with the results that are being read out by Allen.
 So much so that he hilariously kicks a piece of the grass into Allen and then asks for further explanation.
 Whilst this is all happening, to the side Aubameyang and Shkodran Mustafi were in a celebratory mood - one would assume they were on the winning team.

Clubs will be subject to “accountability measures” if they do not comply.
 The league also is expanding teams' bench areas an additional 20 yards to promote increased social distancing. The bench area typically stretches from one 30-yard line to the other. Now teams' bench areas will extend from 20-to-20.
 NFL chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills said Tuesday that there is much greater risk of the virus spreading off the field on game days than on it.
 “Our Kinexon proximity tracking data shows very clearly that the interactions on the field are very brief,” Sills said. "They’re a few seconds at a time. They’re in a highly ventilated environment with a lot of air movement. So those are not as concerning for transmission as, for example, standing face to face and having a conversation, particularly when both individuals are unmasked.
 “So if you think about those risks of transmission, you begin to understand why we’re more focusing our efforts on the (pre- and) postgame interactions, on the sideline, and on the locker rooms,” he added. “Because those are the areas where we see the type of contact that can lead to high-risk contact and exposure if we do have a positive case.”
 The NFL and NFL Players' Association extended their daily COVID-19 testing protocols to also include game days in Week 6. So Tuesday’s memo was another layer of precaution added in response to the Week 8 gameday tests, which would have come back to teams somewhere between Sunday evening and Monday morning.
 The Ravens and Green Bay Packers (running back A.J. Dillon) each had one positive from Sunday morning’s testing. But the Packers had only two high-risk close contact exposures compared to seven for the Ravens.
 The NFL believed that was because the Packers socially distanced more safely than the Ravens did, and it also said the absence of masks was connected to both situations.
