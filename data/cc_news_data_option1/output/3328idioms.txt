Knowledge of our history is important in becoming our better selves. Never satisfied, always striving for a “more perfect union” has been the goal of the leaders of this country from the beginning. It can be uncomfortable, it is hard, it is messy — this becoming a better nation where all are created equal and treated equally under the law.
 When we do not know our history, including local history, and when our minds are fixed on some ideal from the past, we can not form that better society. We become stuck in a certain time and set of believes which will not allow us to grow and be our better selves. That is the challenge facing us at this moment.
 The Aug. 1 rally at the Daviess County Courthouse showed that clearly — waving Confederate Flags, singing Dixie, pretending that lynchings, Jim Crow and discrimination did not exist here; pretending that a prominent Confederate statue does not reflect the time in which it was erected — 1900 during the height of white supremacy — believing that white skin gives us some privilege, is simply to ignore historical facts.
 There were atrocities on both sides during the Civil War. Owensboro, a border town in a border state, contributed troops to both the Union and Confederacy. There was a Union gunboat at the foot of Frederica all during the war and the courthouse was burned by Confederate guerrillas. Large numbers of Blacks enlisted in the Union army, taking great risks but fighting for that “more perfect union” all had been promised.
 But as soon as the war was over and the river was open for traffic, the town went back to normal business. One resident said she did not care which side won, just that the war was over. But by 1876 with the disputed Hayes--Tilden election and the deal made with the Compromise of 1877, Reconstruction ended, Hayes became president and the New South emerged with the old leadership, and white supremacy reigned.
 Here there were lynchings of Blacks on the courthouse square. Blacks were not allowed in white businesses, schools and restaurants. They were told to keep their place. Many were essentially re-enslaved as sharecroppers or janitors and maids. Not until the 1960s did some beginnings of equal rights come to our town with the Civil Rights movement.
 And always there was the Confederate statue to signal that though the war was lost, the battle of who is in control was won. By the time that statue went up, Owensboro had become more Southern in attitude than it had ever been. There were myths of a lost cause, of a romantic way of life, of a white society with cheap black labor, and even for the poorest whites, there was someone to look down upon.
 Until we can accept each other as our neighbor, brother and sister, as our churches preach; until we can judge each other by our abilities rather than the color of our skin; until we can make Owensboro a place all our children may want to return; until our city projects a diverse and welcoming atmosphere for all; until the statue is moved to a more appropriate place where it can be explained and put into context with all of our history, we can not pretend that we are a welcoming city.
 I had ancestors on both sides of that conflict. I have studied and taught Civil War and Southern history for many years, and it took a long time for me to see the statue for what it represents, especially to our Black citizens.
 It is hard to give up the idealized past, the stories passed down through our families, the pride of being Southern and to recognize the privilege we have partly because of the unpaid or poorly paid labor of others. I do not want history erased, I want people to know their history, to study it, evaluate it, accept that we still have a way to go for that “more perfect union.”
 History is there to teach us to grow and change as we have deeper understanding and write new chapters. I urge Daviess Countians to become less romantic about the past, and more realistic and reasonable. It is time to lay the glamorized past to rest and to move into a better and brighter and more inclusive future.

Sometimes, there is no easy solution.
 You’re damned if you do.
 And damned if you don’t.
 The decision on whether to reopen schools to in-person classes is one of those times.
 Some schools in Kentucky will re-open this week.
 Most will wait until late September or early October to return students to the classroom.
 Those students will be learning online for the next month to six weeks.
 Like a lot of people, I have concerns about online-only classes.
 There are a lot of single-parent households these days.
 And the parent has to go to work, leaving the children at home.
 Some of them will excel in online classes.
 But those who are not motivated to learn, likely won’t.
 A big part of school for kindergarten and first-grade is socialization, things like learning to sit still, not talk during class and get along with others.
 Will that work with distance learning?
 Actually, socialization is a big part of all education.
 You make friends — some for life.
 You date and sometimes marry one of those people.
 You play sports and do activities with others.
 In-person classes are very important for both education and socialization.
 So, open the schools and bring the kids back?
 Well, not so fast.
 In Martin County, Florida, schools opened on Aug. 11.
 The next day, nine students were diagnosed with coronavirus.
 And in less than a week, the number had mushroomed to 136.
 The Cherokee County School District in Georgia closed three high schools and sent almost 2,000 people to quarantine soon after it reopened.
 USA Today reported this week that more than 70 school systems have found cases of coronavirus in their classrooms.
 So, yeah, you’re damned if you do and damned if you don’t.
 A lot of students will be suffer either way.
 But keeping them healthy seems to be the best option.
 Hopefully, remedial classes will be able to bring up to speed those who fall behind.
 Hopefully.

Sunday’s final will probably mark the Cameroonian’s last appearance for PSG (his contract expires at the end of August), and it would be quite poetic if he were to make a decisive contribution coming off the bench in the biggest game in the club’s history.
