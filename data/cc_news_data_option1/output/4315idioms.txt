El CE Sabadell va sumar ahir el seu primer punt en el retorn a Segona Divisió després d’empatar a domicili contra el Saragossa (0-0). El conjunt arlequinat va estrenar d’aquesta forma el seu caseller de la temporada i reforça (en part) el seu argumentari per canviar la dinàmica i apropar-se a la zona tranquil·la de la classificació. El futbol són dinàmiques. Antonio Hidalgo va aconseguir que els seus futbolistes recuperessin l’ordre i la capacitat de generar perill de mesos enrere. Van signar el millor partit en la franja del professionalisme estatal, imposant-se amb claredat per moments a un dels històrics de la categoria. Necessitava sentir-se gran després d’entrar en la monotonia perillosa de jugar perquè sí i de perdre de forma sistemàtica.
 ## Opcions de victòria
 La verticalitat visitant va marcar el ritme del partit. El Sabadell va fer mèrits per endur-se la victòria en diferents moments. Va tenir la sensació primer de controlar el tempo a ritme de contraatacs. Gorka Guruzeta van tenir una doble ocasió de gol abans del descans i Juan Hernández va poder materialitzar una pujada a la contra després de recuperar la pilota per trencar el 0-0 del marcador. No van tenir la inspiració per sentenciar. Han d’assimilar bé l’assignatura pendent per convertir en tendència el bon paper col·lectiu a terres aragoneses.
 Els arlequinats van tenir també els tocs de genialitat que sovint no entren en el guió. Hernández, de nou, va tenir l’acció més clara del partit en enviar una pilota al pal després d’una acció de falta directa en el tram final del segon període. El Saragossa va saber reaccionar a contracorrent. Va tenir les seves oportunitats i va poder donar la sorpresa tocant el temps de descompte. Javi Ros va poder tancar la victòria local amb un xut llunyà de més de 30 metres de distància a passada de Gabriel Fernández que finalment no va ser gol. El 0-0 va fer justícia al partit i a la millora del Sabadell en el curs del coronavirus que accentua la importància de cada jornada. El següent rival en el camí arlquinat cap a la permanència serà el Leganès, un dels grans favorits a ascendir a la Lliga Santander.

THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) — A man described by Greek police as most likely a migrant trafficker was killed while trying to avoid a police checkpoint in the north of the country, and another was arrested after also fleeing and killing six sheep and a sheepdog with his vehicle. The separate incidents occurred Saturday, but police announced them Sunday. The first driver was stopped on a country road in northern Greece, at some distance from the Greek-Turkish border, police said. After seeing the checkpoint, he drove away at a high speed and crashed into a tree, according to police. They said the man was pronounced dead at a hospital and didn't have documents that would help identity him. The man who drove into a flock of sheep also had been stopped on a country road near the city of Kavala, police said. They described the arrested driver as a 30-year-old Syrian. Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about cases under investigation, said they suspect both men were migrant traffickers heading to the Greek-Turkish border to pick up people. Police say they use the pretext of checking on drivers’ licenses to stop suspected traffickers because most aren't licensed to drive and in many cases they use stolen cars, fake license plates or both. Traffickers, having caught on that police are setting up highway checkpoints, have taken to using back roads. But recent reinforcements have allowed police to try to apprehend suspects on less-used roads as well. ____________________________ Demetris Nellas contributed to this report from Athens, Greece

Their son, Henry (Noah Jupe, proving once again why he is in such high demand), loves playing the violin at his upper-crust school and is a big admirer of his father.

Following her trail, Doc tangles with a huge cast of strange bedfellows played by big movie stars in funny garb. Ideology has imploded. Black nationalists keep murky company with suited-up FBI agents, who may or may not be in cahoots with the police, represented ("after a long day of civil rights violations") by a very funny Josh Brolin in a sensationally horrid buzz cut. There will be heroin, for sure. There may or may not be a cartel called Golden Fang. Beyond that, is someone out to get Doc or is it all in his addled head, suspended between a permanent high, grief for lost love, and the billowing paranoia he shares with everyone he meets?

What's often misunderstood about racism in the United States is that it is not simply someone using a slur, or systemic issues that make it harder for Black people and other racial minorities to vote, get a mortgage or find a good- paying job, according to a panel on race and racism convened at Southern University at New Orleans on Friday.
 More broadly, speakers with expertise in history, culture and race argued, racism also includes the inability of a person in power — particularly a White person — to acknowledge that race played a role in their success, and therefore accept their own social responsibility to change that status quo.
 "We usually understand that racism is defined as prejudice plus power," said panelist Joyce King, a professor of educational policy studies at Georgia State University. But "dysconscious racism," she said, allows people to accept assumptions "that justify White privilege."
 That was just one of the take-aways from the virtual SUNO panel, sponsored by the school's Center for African & African-American Studies, which offered an opportunity for four experts in systemic racism, criminal justice reform and the history of brutal policing in Black communities in Louisiana to discuss a path forward in the wake of social and political upheaval across the country in recent months.

That history, all too often forgotten, suggests a need to better understand racism and racist practices in Louisiana and elsewhere, they said.
 "Can we define, or even identify racism?" said Clyde Robinson, associate professor and the director of the Center for African and African American Studies, before noting the effects dysconscious racism, nonunanimous juries and other rules with racist origins have on Black residents.
 The panel discussion centered in part on White privilege — a topic that President Donald Trump has asked be removed from federal agencies' anti-racism training sessions — and that panelists said is often misunderstood.
 It is not meant to suggest that White people have never struggled, or that their individual accomplishments are unearned.
 Instead, it's used to describe the benefit of the doubt given to White residents in certain situations, such as in interactions with police, or the expectation that the missteps of one White person won't be applied to all people who share that identity.

HOUSTON (AP) — J.J. Watt stalked the sideline, helmet in hand, scowl on his face as he watched his Houston Texans be dominated by the Green Bay Packers, a team he spent his childhood rooting for. The three-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year has been through a lot in his 10 years with the Texans, but Sunday might have been rock bottom. Aaron Rodgers threw for 283 yards and four touchdowns to lead Green Bay to a 35-20 win in a game where the Texans were thoroughly overmatched from the start. Normally jovial and loquacious, Watt, who grew up in Wisconsin, has become increasingly sullen and terse when fielding questions this season as the losses have piled up. In happier times, Watt would speak at length when asked about virtually any topic. That was not the case on Sunday after the Texans fell to 1-6. “I’m frustrated. I’m angry. It sucks,” Watt said. “I don’t know what else I’m supposed to feel.” Watt, who had two tackles for losses Sunday, was asked what it was like to come within inches of sacking Rodgers, only to have him escape and throw a perfect pass downfield. “What do you think that’s like,” he asked before a long pause. “Not great.” The Texans were not able to recover after Green Bay raced out to a 21-0 halftime lead. Interim coach Romeo Crennel lost his second straight game after winning his debut in the wake of Bill O’Brien’s firing following an 0-4 start. He said last week’s loss to Tennessee wasn’t as tough as this one because they did a lot of things well before falling in overtime. “We lost it by a hair. This game was a different game,” he said. “We didn’t lose this one by a hair. It was just too much. We didn’t do enough early in the game. Didn’t play well enough in the game to keep it close.” Houston...
