Hinter vorgehaltener Hand hatten sich auch andere – immer noch namhafte – Werderaner an der „Alles-wird-gut-Politik“ der Bosse abgearbeitet. Auch ihnen fehlte in der Krise ein Plan B. Damit lagen sie eigentlich genau auf der Linie von Dieter Burdenski, aber nur Burdenski wagte sich aus der Deckung. Es spricht für ihn, dass er den Finger in die Wunde legt, aber es spricht genauso für Frank Baumann, dass er sich im persönlichen Gespräch mit seinem Kritiker auseinandergesetzt hat. Und so ganz untätig, wie ihnen vorgehalten wurde, waren dann auch die Bosse nicht: Vor dem Freiburg–Spiel hatte sich der Aufsichtsrat immerhin schon mal untereinander abgestimmt – auch in der Personalie Kohfeldt, in der es durchaus unterschiedliche Auffassungen gegeben haben soll.

Dravid advised the players to only focus on things that are within their control, like ways to regain their skills after such a long and unforseen hiatus.
 "As sportsmen, we are used to dealing with a lot of uncertainty during our careers. Everything doesn't fall into place. You tend to get scared and worried about stuff but I think one of the things that I would have done is think about things I can control.
 "All you can control is your preparation, practice, emotional and mental well- being. You cannot control your results or performances...maybe it would take a bit of time to catch up to their original skill level. But that won't take long. It is just like riding a bicycle.

WASHINGTON (WJLA/CNN) - Police in Washington D.C. are offering a $25,000 reward in their search for the suspects who killed a 71-year-old woman as she tried to stop a fight involving her granddaughter.Robert Alston says his mother, 71-year-old Sheila Lucas, was beloved for her generosity towards her children and her dozens of grandchildren and great- grandchildren."There was days my mom went without, just to make sure that we had food on the table, clothes on our back. Being a single mother growing up, that's the woman that I know. That's my queen. That's my everything," he said.According to Alston, Lucas was once again helping family Saturday evening near a Giant grocery store in Washington D.C. Family members say Lucas drove from her home to the store after her granddaughter had been attacked by two girls inside it.Sheila Lucas, 71, was beloved for her generosity towards her children and her dozens of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, according to her son, Robert Alston.Lucas met her daughter and granddaughter outside of the store and was walking with them to their nearby home when the attackers returned, the family says.“My mom tried to step in between to make sure that they didn’t fight,” Alston said. “A gunshot rang [out]. My mom gets hit in the head, and then, she’s no longer here with us.”The Metropolitan Police Department says Lucas was taken to the hospital and later pronounced dead. Another man nearby was also shot. His injuries were not life-threatening.“Who shoots a 71-year-old woman in the head who has nothing to do with all this? We didn’t get a chance to say, ‘Mom, we love you.’ We didn’t get a chance to say, ‘Mom, we’ll see you later.’ We didn’t get that opportunity. Her life was taken from us,” Alston said.Police said Monday afternoon they did not yet have a suspect description or an arrest to announce in the case. Alston, a pastor at Thankful Baptist Church, has spent the past three weeks preaching online about forgiveness, so he wanted to send a message to whoever killed his mother.“We’re asking you if you have a heart - because we know you have a grandmother; we know you have a mother - turn yourself in. Let justice prevail,” he said. “I forgive you. I release you. But for justice’s sake, please go turn yourself in."MPD says there is a reward of up to $25,000 for anyone who gives information leading to an arrest and conviction.Copyright 2020 WJLA, Lucas Family via CNN.

“She was not only a suffragist, but educational rights were huge for her,” Sydney Reilly said. “Later on, there was a school associated with Hillcrest Services that was called the Anna Bell Lawther Academy. Education was very important to her.”
 Reilly, a recent Loras College graduate, majored in history and minored in sociology and gender studies. She has been an assistant archivist at the Dubuque Center for History since her junior year.
 Along with Loras junior and fellow history major Amelia Foley, she has been researching the subject in preparation for a 100th anniversary exhibit that was slated to open at the college in March. The project has been postponed until later this year.
 By 1894, six states, including Iowa, had granted women the right to vote on bond and municipal issues but not in any election where candidates were involved. Kansas, Montana, Louisiana, New York and Michigan were the others that joined Iowa in partial suffrage.
 Montana would lead the states in enfranchising women, giving them full suffrage in 1914. Two years later, the state elected Jeanette Rankin to the U.S. House of Representatives, the first woman in the country elected to such a position.
 Around the turn of the century, however, it continued to be a battle. More often than not, the weapons were simply words. But as has often been proven throughout history, words have the power to persuade, to enlighten and to create change.
 Through speeches, editorials and pamphlets, the women and men who felt strongly one way or the other about the suffrage issue used their verbal and writing prowess to persuade others that women had earned and deserved the right to vote — or not.
 “There were a lot of people, men and women, against giving women the vote,” Reilly said. “The anti-suffrage sentiment was that women were considered pious and domestic. That they were submissive.”
 There was divisiveness even within the movement, with some anti-suffragists saying women didn’t need to vote since their husbands already did, while others believed a woman’s intellect fell short of being able to make decisions about important issues.
 “There were people who felt women could just tell their husbands how to vote,” Reilly said. “So, there was no need for them to go to the polls.”
 Woman’s suffrage was not off-limits anywhere, including in the religious sector. Reilly said many religious officials often spoke from the pulpit about women wanting the right to vote.
 “There was a Bishop Doling who said he supported women’s suffrage,” Reilly said. “He spoke about it on Mother’s Day, comparing Mary and how she took care of Jesus and had his ear, saying women were intelligent enough to make these decisions.”
 Doling served on the advisory board of the Dubuque Equal Suffrage Association.
 On the other side of the issue, Archbishop James Keane did not feel the same way his colleague did.
 “He thought the women fighting for this right were deteriorating their characters and their power as women,” Reilly said.
 Charles McLean was an example of an anti-suffragist who simply didn’t think women were smart enough to vote. McLean worked as a reporter for the Dubuque Herald and as an editorial writer for the Dubuque Times-Journal. He left the newspaper business to become a publicist, and one of his first clients was a group opposed to women’s rights. He served as president of the Dubuque Chamber of Commerce and vice president of the Carnegie-Stout Public Library board.
 During a visit to South Dakota, McLean spoke to a group about the anti- suffrage movement and the loose morals, low intellect and abnormal characters of the women who supported the cause. In the audience was a member of the South Dakota Equal Suffrage Association, known only by Mrs. Pyle, who was so appalled by McLean’s words that she wrote a letter to the Dubuque Equal Suffrage Association. The president of the association, Lawther, took the complaint seriously.
 Lawther wrote to Mrs. Pyle, apologizing for the offensive speech of McLean. Still feeling bad about the impression left by McLean in South Dakota, she and the Dubuque County Equal Suffrage Association raised $125, the equivalent of more than $2,900 today, and sent it to the South Dakota chapter.
 Lawther, the first woman to serve on the Iowa Board of Education, described herself as “The Old Lady of Dubuque.” During World War I, she organized activities to help promote Liberty Loans, war savings stamps and the Red Cross. She served on the Iowa Food Administration board and on the Red Cross Congressional Committee.
 Lawther would continue to work in politics, entering the race for state auditor as a Democratic nominee in 1928. Although she lost the election, she garnered more votes than most of the men on the Democratic ticket.
 It was a sign of the times: The political arena wasn’t just for men.

Spurs had missed out on a top-four place the previous season under Harry Redknapp, yet they possessed some fine players, particularly in attack with Gareth Bale, Rafael van der Vaart, Aaron Lennon and Luka Modric, all at the club. Despite approaching his 21st birthday, Falque was signed with an eye on the future, more so than the present, given the players ahead of him in the pecking order.
 Indeed, Falque didn’t make a single appearance under Redknapp during the first half of the season and only managed one better at Southampton - then in League One - after joining them on loan in January. Redknapp’s departure that summer and Andre Villas-Boas’ subsequent arrival, offered Falque another chance to impress and almost a year after signing for the club, he finally made his debut against PAOK in the Europa League.
 Falque made five appearances in all competitions for Spurs in 2012/13, including a five-minute cameo in his one and only Premier League appearance against Everton in December, but again he was loaned out in January, this time to Almeria in Spain’s second-tier. That summer, Spurs lost two wingers to a La Liga club: Gareth Bale joined Real Madrid in a world-record £85 million deal and Falque moved to Rayo Vallecano on loan.

HONG KONG (AP) — Stanley Ho, the Macao casino tycoon who was considered the father of modern gambling in China, died Tuesday in Hong Kong, his daughter Pansy Ho said. He was 98.
 Known as the “King of Gambling,” the dashing billionaire and bon vivant secured a four-decade monopoly on casinos in Macao, then parlayed his home advantage to build the empire that still dominated the industry after it opened to foreign companies in 2002.
 He was the former Portuguese colony’s richest person, a lavish spender and accomplished ballroom dancer who wielded great influence both in Macao and in neighboring Hong Kong while — according to U.S. authorities — maintaining ties to organized crime.
 Tall, handsome and of mixed Chinese and European heritage, Ho fathered 17 children with four women. His extended family erupted in high-profile squabbles over his empire during his later years.
 Ho himself avoided the gaming floor.
 “I don’t gamble at all. I don’t have the patience,” Ho told The Associated Press in a rare interview in 2001. “Don’t expect to make money in gambling. It’s a house game. It’s for the house.”
 He also had stakes in businesses that run everything from the ferries and helicopters connecting Hong Kong and Macao, to department stores, hotels, Macao’s airport and its horse-racing tracks.

While Bale was playing a pivotal role in Real Madrid’s Copa Del Rey and Champions League triumphs that season, Falque was finally starting to deliver on his potential, scoring three goals and registering two assists in an entertaining Ray Vallecano side containing Saul Niguez in midfield and managed by Paco Jemez. Rayo finished 12th that season, despite conceding a staggering 80 goals.
 That form was enough to pique the interest of Genoa who moved to sign Falque in a deal worth double the £900,000 fee Spurs had spent to sign him three years previously. It proved to be worth every penny. Under the tutelage of Gian Piero Gasperini, the mastermind behind Atalanta’s astounding rise over the past few years, Falque fired Genoa to a sixth-place finish in Serie A.
 Lining up on the right side of Genoa’s 3-4-3 system, Falque top-scored for Genoa with 13 goals while also registering three assists. Gasperini has unlocked the potential of numerous players at his disposal during his spells with Genoa and Atalanta, with Diego Perotti, Alejandro ‘Papu’ Gomez, Josip Ilicic and Duvan Zapata among his success stories.

Props and second rows are viewed as the most vulnerable players, spending an average of more than 13 minutes per match in high transmission risk situations. Scrums are identified as making up 50 per cent of high-risk exposure time during an 80 minute match.
 The award of a free-kick against the infringing side will almost certainly replace a reset, the idea likely to meet favour with lots of pundits and fans who have argued for years far too much time is wasted on getting scrums 100 per cent right.
 World Rugby's next main recommendation is to eliminate upright tackles, which they say would reduce high-risk exposure by 20 per cent. Choke tackles also likely to be outlawed as players are encouraged to avoid any sort of face to face contact.
 Technically face-to-face tackles are against the law, but if the recommendations are implemented referees would be compelled to crack down further.
 The idea of ending team huddles, which occur frequently before, during and immediately after matches, will take some getting used to for rugby sides at every level of the game.
 It is one of rugby's biggest tradition, not just with full team huddles but also the forwards getting together at regular intervals of a game to discuss tactics and fire one another up.
 You often see the eight forwards huddle together before a lineout, when there is a break in play, or when a try has just been conceded.

WALPOLE--With schools shuttered in March through to at least June, plants growing at the Norfolk County Agricultural High School for its annual plant sale were left in limbo until the three-pronged Aggie Abundance program was formulated by staff and administrators.
 First up, the plants students had started to grow after February vacation that were slated for the annual plant sale to raise approximately $20,000 for the school each year. While groundskeeper Patrick Collins kept them going for three weeks after schools were closed in addition to his other jobs, plant science teacher Jeff Thompson and others stepped in to help when they were allowed back on campus.
 In all, 100 plants were delivered to Norwood Hospital staff, 50 plants to the Walpole Fire Department, and 50 plants to the Walpole Police Department, all on the Friday before Mother's Day as a way to thank first responders.
 "They were so appreciative," Thompson said. "It made me feel great to help them because they do so much for the community."
 Part two for the Aggie Abundance initiative is to distribute plants to school families after the school grounds are planted. While students typically would be helping with the beautification of the campus, Thompson said it is school staff that will be doing the work this time.
 "We plant the campus to the nines," Thompson said. "It really looks beautiful. If seniors do get a chance to walk and receive their diplomas, we want it to look nice for them. There's a lot of pride in our school and I think it's reflected in how it looks."
 Teacher Lisa Collins said they put in the extra effort to make the campus appealing because a large number of people from the community walk around the campus.
 "It's like a public park," Collins said. "It's kind of a shining jewel in the county."
 She said a survey was sent out to families to see who could come pick up plants and who needed a delivery.
 "Everything will already be pre-boxed so when they arrive, we put them in their trunk," Collins said. "We're very mindful of making this a safe distribution."
 For the third initiative, Thompson said the school will be planting a Covid Victory Garden instead of the usual pumpkins that are planted on 1.5 acres of land for the annual haunted hay rides.
 He said last year they received a donation of 1,500 packages of seeds from the University of Rhode Island and he has planted everything, some 10,000 plants, in the school's greenhouses.
 Peppers, tomatoes, eggplant, kale and other durable vegetables that do not require a lot of refrigeration will be grown and distributed to school families first, and then food pantries, for those who are struggling and will possibly continue to struggle with the economic fallout from the pandemic and job losses.
 "We're hoping to offset some food shortages and food insecurities," Thompson said. "The idea is, 'let's not waste any of this stuff, let's get it out to people who need it.'"
 Collins said the Covid Victory Garden will supply a free weekly Farmer's Market for Aggie families.
 "We already have staff ready to deliver to families that don't have a car," Collins said. "We don't want somebody's economic status to inhibit them from participating in the program."
 She said they will also be coordinating with the Walpole Food Pantry and Abundant Harvest to see who might be in need of what so any extra crops will not be wasted.
 Thompson said the initiative is in line with what the school was moving toward before the pandemic hit, namely the reintroduction of growing food on campus, with students running the program with staff support.
 "It they come back in September, there will be plenty for the kids to go out and pick," Thompson said.
 Thompson points to the collaboration between staff and administration as the key to bringing all the ideas to fruition and Collins agrees.
 "The Aggie is an excellent place to work even during times of quarantine," Collins said. There's a lot of good going on."
