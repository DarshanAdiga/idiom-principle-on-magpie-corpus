Would it be correct to say that Hedge’s remarks were just a slip of the tongue or were deliberately made to provoke controversy to deflect attention from the government’s immediate troubles? Looking at his seniority in the party and his many outrageous statements earlier, which have even led to cases being filed against him earlier, it would be difficult to believe that they were inadvertent or so.

The product itself contains extract of blackcurrants grown in New Zealand and is thought to have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
 Within weeks the pain had subsided to a level where he was able to join a gym.
 “When I started working out, it was just the bike and the cross trainer for the first three months.
 “But the weight just started falling off and I lost four or five pounds a week, easily.
 “I was a 42-inch waist and I’m now a 34/36. It’s insane.”
 Nick also shrunk down from 19 to 13 stone and says he feels so much better as a result.
 “People take losing weight for granted, but when you’re a bit impaired in your ability to exercise it’s harder to do.
 “Doctors say to go swimming, but I found it so hard to do stuff and if it got cold my joints used to really stiffen up.
 “If I went swimming and stepped out of the pool I would get cold instantly and be achey for the next couple of days, so it puts you off doing anything. It was a vicious circle.”
 Crucially, Nick is able to enjoy getting out and about with his daughters, too.
 “It’s been life-changing for us as a family.
 “The other day my daughter was showing me her push-ups, so I was doing them and pushing off the floor and clapping.
 “She was laughing at me – but the things I can do now that I couldn’t do before are amazing.
 “We’ve been clambering over big boulders at a place local to me, called Brimham Rocks, and we’ve also been getting out on the mountain bikes when the weather permits.
 “My youngest daughter does tell me off for doing jumps and stunts – but it’s a world away from where I was a few years ago.”
 Most surprised of all is Nick’s doctor.
 “My doctor is over the moon with the way that I’ve improved. But I get the impression he’s still perplexed by it all,” says Nick.
 The key ingredients in the New Zealand blackcurrant extract Nick takes are ‘anthocyanins’.
 These are pigments in the fruit’s skin responsible for their dark purple colouring, which belong to a group of flavonoids called ‘polyphenols’ and possess high levels of antioxidants.
