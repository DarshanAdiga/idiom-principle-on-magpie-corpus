The model suggests that pepper plants with close neighbors will not grow many long roots. However, the plants invest extra energy in growing more roots close to home. When all of the plants use the same strategy, they all stay out of each other's way. But the research found that the plants aren't necessarily being cooperative--they're still selfishly trying to maximize their own nutrients.

Dodger third baseman Justin Turner's mid-game six positive Covid test result is mentioned. His subsequent (and highly controversial) maskless post-game celebration among teammates and their families is ignored. But as an in-house production, that's not really surprising--this film focuses on the positives, for the most part. Kevin Cash's scrappy Rays, and the emergence of Randy Arozarena as a post-season hero, are a bit short-changed in terms of telling the series' story. But again, par for the course with these Cliff's Notes versions. There just isn't enough time to tell it from the losing team's perspective as well.

The joy is in seeing Dave Roberts' Dodgers, NL pennant winners for three of the past four years, finally win a championship for Los Angeles--its first since 1988. And of course they lost the championship in 2017 to the proven cheaters, the Houston Astros, arguably the most despicable team since the 1919 White Sox. So Roberts and his team were due, to say the least. The 2020 World Series went six thrilling games, a true David and Goliath clash with the mega- payroll Dodgers squaring off against the very best AL team, the micro-payroll Tampa Bay Rays.

Late Thursday night, Coastal Carolina Athletics released a statement saying that due to a positive COVID-19 test within its football program, Saturday's matchup with No. 17 Louisiana-Lafayette was canceled. The university added that due to contact tracing, "an entire position group would not be available to play due to possible exposure."
 After the decision was made, Chadwell had to do a Zoom call with his team and tell them the news.
 "They're devastated," Chadwell said. "It was a tough Zoom to share because they were looking forward to that game."
 This is the fourth game of the 2020 season that the Chanticleers had to either cancel or postpone due to COVID-19. It's the first time that a Coastal test was the reason a game had to be canceled or postponed.
 "I actually feel fortunate that we made it this far, considering the hotspot our area has been," Chadwell said. "I give credit to our players for trying to do the right thing all year long."
 Chadwell said that once there was a positive test, the program quickly moved to check if it was a false positive. He added that he and his coaching staff kept pushing practice back before the unfortunate news came in from the lab.
 "We did everything possible to try to play the game," Chadwell said. "When a positive test comes back and you follow the guidelines that are in place and with contact tracing, that's sort of what ends up getting you."
 With the cancellation of the Sun Belt championship game, Coastal Carolina and Louisiana-Lafayette will share the 2020 Sun Belt title. However, according to ESPN's Heather Dinich, the College Football Playoff Committee will honor only one Sun Belt Champion: the Chanticleers.
 "The Sun Belt’s plan was that its highest-ranked CFP team would be its conference champion, so the selection committee would consider No. 12 Coastal to be the Sun Belt champion," Dinich said in a Tweet Friday afternoon.
 There has been some speculation that these two teams could meet up in a bowl game once Coastal is cleared to play. Both Sun Belt Commissioner Keith Gill and Chadwell do not see that happening.
 "It’s not something that I would anticipate happening," Gill said in a teleconference on Friday.

It has been a secluded preseason for the Miami Heat, with workouts, amid the pandemic, solely behind closed doors at AmericanAirlines Arena.
 So as coach Erik Spoelstra raved about the training camp of KZ Okpala, eye rolls easily could have ensued.
 Until Friday night.
 That's when the reality was on display for all to witness at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., with the 2019 second-round pick given the start in the Heat's 117-105 exhibition victory over the Toronto Raptors.
 With absences limiting the Heat rotation, including Jimmy Butler remaining behind in South Florida, Okpala got his opportunity and seized the moment, the former Stanford forward closing with 24 points, including 6 of 10 on 3-pointers, with five rebounds in his 34 minutes.
