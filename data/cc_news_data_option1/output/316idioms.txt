Jo Ann Pellegrin Caillouet thought Jan. 24, 1970, was going to be a typical Saturday afternoon in Houma.
 She thought wrong.
 "My friend Ann Dillard and I were on a Saturday shopping trip," said Caillouet, who was 15 at the time. "We were looking for a parking spot in my little bug at Dupont's, which was on the corner of Barrow and Main. We heard something really loud and felt a vibration."
 The vibration that Caillouet felt stemmed from a blast that changed Houma forever.
 Friday marks 50 years since downtown Houma was rocked by a gas-line explosion that killed three people and injured 25. As a result of the blast, the National Guard was called in to patrol the streets and protect vulnerable businesses and offices after storefront windows shattered.
 A work crew was repairing a gas leak outside the old LaTour's Jewelry Store at Main and Church streets. While drilling into the sidewalk the building suddenly exploded.
 Houma resident Phil Bernard, 75, was one of the first people who saw the aftermath.
 "The actual house shook from the explosion," Bernard said. "It caused me to jump up and run outside. One of my neighbors was pointing toward downtown. I told my wife I had to see what was going on and started running down to the bayou and saw smoke."
 When Bernard made it to the other side of the bayou, he said he couldn't believe what he saw.
 "It's hard to explain," he said. "You're used to seeing something and then walk out into an area that's totally unrecognizable from what you're used to seeing. There was debris and pieces of the building covering the street. I was awestruck. I didn't know how to take it in quite frankly."
 Bernard, who was 26 at the time, volunteered to help emergency workers clear the rubble.
 "Fire trucks started showing up and the chief was trying to assess the situation," he said. "He said they were going to need a crane. I was project manager at Delta Iron Works. I called my boss and told him what was going on."
 After bringing a crane to the site of the explosion, Bernard joined with other crews to work around the clock to sift through the debris.
 "God knows we didn't know what we would find quite frankly," Bernard said. "We didn't know if we would find a bunch of bodies, or what. Everyone was just in total shock. We just didn't know what happened. It was unbelievable."
 The blast claimed the lives of Howard Arceneaux, 60, Peter Knight, 52, and Loren Bourg, 56. Arceneaux and Knight were members of the work crew who were repairing the gas leak and Bourg was Houma's assistant fire chief who was overseeing the repairs.
 The Courier reported in 2010 that dozens of people ran to help, including off- duty police officer Jack Smith.
 "I'd never seen anything like that before in my life," Smith told the Courier in 2010. "The whole two-story building was gone completely. There was no sign of it."
 The explosion ravaged businesses from Lafayette Street to near Barrow Street, witnesses said. Windows at the courthouse were blown out and several interior doors were ripped from their hinges.
 Some witnesses told the Courier that had the explosion occurred on a weekday, more people could have been killed or injured.
 The blast sent pieces of jewelry flying across the street and Courthouse Square, witnesses said. Some believe that diamonds and jewels may lurk in the depths of Bayou Terrebonne to this day.
 Retired federal agent Blayne Bergeron said his firefighter father, Ernest Joseph Bergeron, was also off duty that fateful Saturday when the explosion rocked his Brooklyn Avenue home.
 "I was 11 years old," Bergeron said. "I was in the backyard playing when we heard an explosion and felt the ground shake. I had a little dog named Skippy that jumped straight into my arms just yipping and screaming. It felt like an earthquake. My dad ran out of the house, jumped in our car and just burned rubber. His friend, Loren Bourg, had died. When he got back it was the first time I ever saw my dad cry."
 Although it has been 50 years since the deadly blast, Bernard said he remembers it like yesterday.
 "It's as vivid now as it was that day," he said. "It's something I will never forget."

Kevin obtained his leaving certificate in 2014 and was unsure of what career to pursue. Taking a year out to reflect, Kevin obtained full time employment with Abbott Diagnostic Division in Longford. Working as a Diagnostic assistant, Kevin sought the advice of his work colleagues many of whom were engineers. Some of which had completed courses in IT Sligo and recommended it as a place to study. This along with the advantage of being close to home and smaller class sizes contributed to the choice to study Mechanical Engineering in IT Sligo.

Directional shear refers to a turning of the winds with height. So, if winds are blowing out of the southeast at the surface and then out of the west when you move higher up in the atmosphere, this too will lead to rotation. Right now, as it pertains to Saturday, the wind profile does look like it could lead to rotating thunderstorms. This is why there is a tornado threat in the forecast. However, how much "spin" in the atmosphere is still a bit uncertain at this time.
