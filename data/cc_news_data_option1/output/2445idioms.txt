They argue that women are being sold the idea that they're imperfect and need to be fixed, which can only happen if they continue to buy certain products.

Barcelona boss Quique Setien understands why people would question whether VAR is being used appropriately as an intense debate in LaLiga's title race continues.
 Top spot slipped from Barca's grasp last week as they were held to a goalless draw at Sevilla while Real Madrid earned a 2-1 away win over Real Sociedad.
 Frustrated defender Gerard Pique said it would be "very difficult" for Barca to retain the title, expressing his belief that "it's going to be difficult for Madrid to lose points" having seen what has happened in the games since the restart.
 Those comments, made after the Sevilla game on Friday, were regarded by some as a reference to refereeing decisions Madrid received in their favour during wins over Eibar and Valencia.
 And the issue came to the fore again when Catalan media were unhappy VAR did not rule out a goal from Karim Benzema against Sociedad, while Adnan Januzaj had a goal disallowed for the hosts.
 Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane hit out at constant talk about officials and insisted his team were deserving winners on Sunday, but Setien can understand the furore.
 "There are things that we cannot control and that do not depend on us," said Setien.
 "Regarding [the Madrid] game, everyone has seen how it has been and everyone will make the assessments that are appropriate
 "Pique, not now but always, has always seemed a very intelligent person.
 "I do not speculate [about VAR or Pique's words]. I hear a series of words and the frustration of having lost two points pushes you to say that LaLiga is going to be difficult.
 "In moments of frustration one may not have refined comments. Regarding the VAR, it is a tool that can undoubtedly make us better.
 "You have to use it because it gives us a clearer view of reality when you have to make quick decisions. The good thing is to be able to see them with different angles and with vision.
 "It is understandable that we think about why some actions are reviewed and others not, in some matches yes and others no. And one may think that it is not being used well.
 "What seems clear is, there is always controversy and there will always be these problems that are inherent in football."
 Madrid are top due to their superior head-to-head record and eight matches remain ahead of Barca's home clash with Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday.
 Setien added: "Athletic are a tough, difficult team and they defend well. The games we have played against them have not been easy."

Les "invisibles" sortent de l'ombre. Ils sont chargés de projets, logistique ou production, guides conférenciers, accompagnateurs, agents d'accueil, régisseurs, superviseurs et coordinateurs d'événement, animateurs ou extras de la restauration et représentent les intermittents "hors spectacles" du monde de la culture, du tourisme et de l'événementiel.
 Lourdement affaiblis par la crise sanitaire, ces professionnels organisaient hier un rassemblement devant le Mucem pour alerter l'opinion sur leur situation critique. Tous les salons et congrès sont en effet annulés ou reportés, les aéroports et gares tournent au ralenti, les sites touristiques ne sont pas vraiment opérationnels, les concerts et festivals sont annulés et les croisiéristes ne viendront pas cet été.
 Pour faire simple, le secteur de l'événementiel est au point mort. " _Alors que notre activité s'est arrêtée du jour au lendemain et que le statut de nos professions n'est pas ou peu représenté, la crise sanitaire nous a plongés en grande difficulté et sans visibilité avant le printemps  2021\. Entre CDD d'usage et statut d'auto-entrepreneur, nos situations sont précaires, nous fonctionnons à la mission à partir de deux heures, _souligne Brigitte Gavila, guide conférencière dont 30 à 40 % de l'activité reposent sur les croisiéristes. _Aujourd'hui, je ne peux pas me passer de ces voyageurs, on espère qu'il y aura des escales en août mais rien n'est assuré. Depuis le week-end de Pentecôte, je n'ai eu que trois visites, les gens sont frileux. En temps normal, je tourne à deux sorties par jour._ "
 ## "C'est trop incertain"
 Ces professionnels ont le sentiment d'être les oubliés des plans d'aides du gouvernement à tel point qu'aucune fédération n'existait pour les représenter avant la crise du coronavirus.
 À l'initiative de leur nouvelle structure, la Fédération des intermittents du tourisme, de l'événementiel et de la culture (FMITEC) décidait hier de taper fort avec le lancement simultané de 12 rassemblements à travers la France, notamment à Avignon, Cannes et Nice. Réunis sous la banderole "Nos métiers en danger", ils demandaient : l'abrogation de la réforme de l'assurance chômage, applicable au 1er septembre, la prolongation jusqu'en avril 2021 des droits Pôle Emploi au même titre que leurs confrères intermittents du spectacle et l'extension du fonds de solidarité à tous ces métiers jusqu'au printemps prochain. " _Le coup d'arrêt a été brutal. Si rien n'est fait pour nous aider, de nombreuses personnes seront contraintes de changer de métier,_ craint Florence Bernard, chargée d'événement en free-lance depuis 30 ans. _Le choix du Mucem était symbolique, c'est devenu un lieu touristique incontournable à Marseille, situé à côté des paquebots de croisière qui participent aussi au dynamisme de la ville. Ces dix dernières années, les choses ont changé, Marseille est devenue une destination de loisirs et d'affaire. Nous travaillons beaucoup avec les hôtels de luxe mais la plupart n'ont pas rouvert._ "
 Coincé dans le flou, chacun croise les doigts pour que le tourisme tricolore l'emporte cet été mais imagine aussi un plan B si les choses venaient à mal tourner à la rentrée. " _Je touche strictement 0_ € _depuis le 17  mars ! Qu'est ce que je vais devenir ?_, se demande David Rebelo, coordinateur logistique qui a lancé sa boîte un mois avant l'annonce du confinement. _Le secteur est trop incertain, je ne suis pas sûr de continuer à travailler comme avant. Quitter l'événementiel serait un déchirement, c'est toujours ce que j'ai voulu faire mais je ne vais pas continuer à ne manger que des pâtes ! Je me laisse jusqu'en septembre et si l'activité ne repart pas, j'envisagerai un autre projet..._ "

Why did some books make the cut and not others? Combs cites three criteria used by early church leaders. The first was authorship, whether it was believed to have been written by an apostle, by Paul or by someone close to them. Mark, for example, wasn't an apostle, but was an interpreter for Peter. The second criterium was antiquity, with older texts taking priority over newer ones. And the third was orthodoxy, or how well the text conformed with current Christian teaching.
