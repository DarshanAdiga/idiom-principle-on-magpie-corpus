Major airlines still have a long way to go to justify pre-COVID valuations. Even if we suppose that lower fuel prices and the current cost-cutting initiatives lead to a sharp increase in margins, systemwide monthly volume would have to climb to 60 million passengers, at a minimum. That assumes steady pricing despite likely lower demand, and higher margins despite lost economies of scale. The additional debt assumed by carriers will also lead to higher cash outflows. It is hard to envision a turnaround of this magnitude occurring in 2020.

A raging police force being in a rush to score high in the numbers game--or out on a thinly disguised vendetta spree--will be a familiar thought to today's reader. A trigger-happy approach has marked pol­icing under the Yogi Adityanath government too, with over a hundred encounter deaths in the past three years. The same charges of petty offenders and innocents being killed in cold blood are being levelled today. And Dubey is seen as classic vendetta, just off the files. But the moral greyness that pervades the whole sphere of the criminal justice system today was just taking shape. Just like dacoits could have a heart of gold, cops too could often operate within the old frame of duty and soc­ial conscience. How did everything change? Well, black and white slowly came together to give us grey.

They left it 'til late but Port Adelaide are still top of the AFL heap, while Hawthorn, North Melbourne and Sydney fell further behind the pack in round seven.


  Robbie Gray's superb set-shot goal after the siren at the Gabba on Sunday broke Carlton hearts and secured a 9.10 (64) to 9.7 (61) win that kept them a game clear on top of the ladder.


  The premiership planets seem to be aligning for the Power, who have a 6-1 record after doing their time in Queensland's hub.


  It isn't always pretty, but Ken Hinkley's men are finding a way.


  "We were two (men) down on back-to-back travel games," Hinkley said.


  "Without making a big deal about it, we were up at 5am to get on the plane and coming up to play in beautiful weather, but it was 25 degrees.


  "There were a few things going against us and then, umm, Robbie Gray."


  While Port got out of jail and can look forward to a run of home games, things look more grim for the Hawks (3-4).


  Alastair Clarkson joked this week that he'd donned a hard hat to deal with the barrage of criticism after two disappointing losses.


  The four-time premiership coach said that his Hawks had become easy targets for the critics and Sunday's 14.7 (91) to 7.6 (48) loss to Melbourne will only increase that pressure.


  The optimism around the 2-0 start to Rhyce Shaw's tenure feels like a long time ago after the Kangaroos slipped to their fifth loss in a row.


  The injury-hit Roos were goalless in three quarters in an 11.11 (77) to 2.11 (23) loss to Richmond at Metricon Stadium that moved the Tigers into fourth spot.


  Gold Coast continued their rise with a 13.14 (92) to 9.6 (60) win over the Swans that made it four defeats on the trot for John Longmire's men.


  Brisbane bounced back from last week's loss to Geelong with a 13.10 (88) to 10.8 (68) win over GWS that moved them into second spot on the ladder.


  Last year's beaten grand finalists goes into next week's grand final rematch with Richmond with a 3-4 record.

He soon caught the eye of the then chief minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, and was fielded as a ruling party candidate in the 1995 assembly polls. From 1996 to 2004, he won four parliamentary elections on the trot, lording it over Siwan like his personal fiefdom. In spite of being named, at regular intervals, in several high-profile cases of extortion, kidnapping and killings, he ran a vast crime syndicate virtually at will like nobody else before him, with its network spread across several states and beyond. With a powerful don like him in the saddle, enjoying unrestricted access to the corridors of power it was hardly surprising for Bihar to earn the dubious distinction of the veritable capital of gang lords.

  “There’s no question that under his (Biden) leadership, he would help shape international institutions like the UN to give India a (permanent) seat on the Security Council, he would fulfil its (India) status as a major defence partner,” former U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma said on Saturday.


  “He (Biden) would work together with India to keep our citizens collectively safe. That means standing up against cross-border terrorism and standing with India when its neighbours attempt to change the status quo,” he added.


  Mr. Verma, an Indian-American who was U.S. ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017, joined three other prominent Indian-Americans to make a pitch for the small but highly influential community to support and vote for Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential elections.


  The 77-year-old former U.S. vice president is set to be formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August. He will challenge 74-year-old incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican in the November 3 presidential elections.


  Mr. Verma, Biden Unity Task Force Economic Policy advisor Sonal Shah, former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy and Centre for American Progress Action Fund CEO Neera Tanden in their address to a virtual event argued that over the past several decades, Mr. Biden has a proven track record of being the best friend of Indians and Indian-Americans, be it as a Senator from Delaware or as a vice president under the Obama administration.


  “There’s no question president Biden would build a more inclusive, tolerant just and fair administration that would take US-India relations to new heights,” Mr. Verma said at the event — ‘An Electorate Coming of Age: Indian Americans for Biden Community Town Hall’


  He urged the Indian-American community to make Joe Biden’s dream of making India and the U.S. the two closet nations in the world a reality.


  “I can confidently say, there would have been no US India Civil Nuclear Deal but for Joe Biden,” Mr. Verma said.


  “In 2006, I remember the remarks he made where he said, ‘My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States. If that occurs, the world will be safer.’ Think about that for a second. He made those remarks in 2006. And here we are, it’s 2020. Let’s make Joe Biden’s dream a reality. That only becomes a reality if he becomes president,” he said.


  In her address, Neera Tanden urged Indian-Americans to take steps every day over the next three-and-a-half months to ensure that Biden becomes the president.


  Sonal Shah said she will vote for Biden as she wants a country that is open to people like her, to her friends, to her colleagues and to everyone else.


  “We are not just immigrants, we are not just people sitting on the side, we are part of that American fabric and welcome us to help create that fabric because we’ve been lucky enough to be able to do that. But it took people like Joe Biden to allow us and help us participate and give us those chances. We’ve benefited from that. So now I vote because I believe he is the right person, and we can build that country together with him,” she said.


  According to Dr Murthy, Joe Biden’s recognition and appreciation for immigrants and for communities like Indian-Americans is forming an incredibly important part of the backbone of the United States of America.


  “This is a moment for our country when leadership matters, when values matter. When we go to the voting booth, as we think about how to build support for the candidate that will best reflect our vision and our hopes and our dreams. Let’s lead with our values. Let’s vote for the person who understands us,” he said at the event organised jointly by the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for Biden, the AAPI Victory Fund and South Asians for Biden.


  Later in a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, who is on National Finance Committee for Biden, said, “Most Indian-Americans would say without hesitation that Biden would be a better president and world leader and better for India on all counts.”


  “The choice is clear for voting in November 2020. The choice is even clearer for Indo Americans and South Asians. Biden is the best answer for India and Indian-Americans. The Indian community sees him as one of ‘our’ leaders,” he said.

On July 14, another CLP was convened and the party again reached out to Pilot. However, Pilot skipped the meet again. Finally, the Congress decided to up the ante. Congress media cell chief Randeep Surjewala announced that Pilot was being sacked as deputy CM and the PCC chief. Two other rebel leaders-- Vishvendra Singh and Meena--were also dropped from the cabinet. The party imm­ediately appointed minister and three-term legislator Govind Singh Dotasra as PCC chief. Surjewala blamed the BJP for conspiring to topple the Rajasthan government and said that Pilot and his loyalists had been "trapped by the BJP" to become co-conspirators. Surjewala and other Congress leaders also asserted that Pilot's grouse over being sidelined is misplaced since in a political career of just 16 years, he had gone from being a Lok Sabha MP to Union minister and then PCC chief and deputy CM--a resume most seasoned and veteran politicians can't boast of.

The rhythm of farming continues almost undisturbed by outside crises in society. However, the management of vegetable production is in turmoil. How many acres of what product will be needed on a daily basis? Will restaurants, hotels and entertainment venues of all types be open? What will be happening with the schools at all levels? What about other large institutional users? While the pandemic hit during late season harvest this year in Yuma, how do farmers, harvesters, shippers, coolers and distributors plan for fall 2020 production?


  Despite all the challenges that Yuma County agricultural producers now face, I believe they will figure them out. We have excellent soil, enough water to meet irrigation demands, talented and creative growers and the best weather to keep fresh vegetables and leafy greens on the store shelves for consumers. In addition, the food safety practices developed by the leafy green growers of Yuma County are a national model for excellence. Grow on, Yuma, grow on!

South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks’ July 10 announcement of the zebra mussel infestation in Day County’s Pickerel Lake has sounded the alarm for many people in the Glacial Lakes region.
 “It’s one of those things you just hope is not going to arrive at your doorstep, but it did,” said Dave Pearson, president of the Pickerel Lake Conservancy. “My initial reaction was I was angry and concerned. Zebra mussels are a very troublesome species. There’s no known program for eradicating or managing them effectively in a freshwater lake, so once they get established, they’re very difficult to control.”
 Pickerel is the first lake in northeast South Dakota in which the invasive species has been found. GFP Fisheries Supervisor Mark Ermer said one of the mussels was already an inch and a half in size, which indicates it has been growing there for at least two years already.

  Our economy has taken a financial hit in multiple sectors, especially restaurants, thanks to COVID-19. Normally, the winter months are filled with promise and profit, and make up for those leaner summer months.


  But this year, many of the winter visitors went home early due to COVID-19, especially those from Canada, which alone was a big hit to the local economy. Then, the hits kept coming over the last few months.


  According to a 2019 Yuma Sun report, winter visitors have a $452.8 million economic impact on Yuma County every season.


  The story cited a study by Arizona State University, which estimated that Yuma County had 62,266 winter visitors between December 2017 and March 2018, who spent $179 million.


  From that $179 million in estimated spending, the research added up the visitors’ economic “output” in terms of 4,700 jobs created, $40.7 million in local and state taxes paid, $35 million in federal taxes paid, and a 2.5 multiplier for direct spending, which stays in the local economy.


  For our winter visitors to return, they need to feel safe here, to know that they will be healthy and that the community is all on board with actions to keep COVID-19 at bay.


  If the winter visitors don’t return, how will Yuma recoup that loss? It would be devastating.


  If that isn’t incentive to bring our COVID-19 case numbers under control here, I don’t know what is.

Finally, what is also shocking is the way the central authorities of higher education are playing with the mindset and future of the students. Students have jobs and admissions (to prestigious foreign universities) at stake; they cannot eternally wait as the UGC's recommendation for extending the exam deadlines suggests. Delhi University postponed the exams twice, each time merely days before the scheduled exams, and is planning to hold them a month later now. The mental trauma this generates in such repeated postponement can destabilise any student and it will be extremely unfair to make them go through this tense process once again. Students in many states who were told that their exams have been cancelled are out of any exam preparation mindset. To suddenly tell them now that they have to go back to an exam mode is cruel, to say the least.

In the fulsomeness of high summer, not much garden work is being done in Chaos except in early morning hours just after daybreak, when mourning doves are still cooing about their day’s plans and sunrise waves wands of pale gold through the trees, turning spiderwebs to gleaming, delicate silver wire for a brief moment before it moves on to set shards of gold dancing along the leaves on the forest floor. It’s still cool then, the moist dawn air pleasant on my bare arms before the sun rises above the treetops to turn the garden into a sauna. I make my ritual morning inspection round with pruners in hand to deal with tree sprouts, gone-to-seed lilies, not-there-yesterday tall weeds and the like as I walk.

I recently had a chance to take a close look at something I knew about, but hadn't paid much attention to until now. When I did, I realized Freeport and Stephenson County have something that truly is a hidden gem. It's the All Veterans Memorial Park of Stephenson County.


   


  The 1.6-acre park at 2850 South Walnut Road is just north of Walnut Acres Nursing Center. The memorial is exactly what it says -- a tribute to all veterans from Stephenson County who have ever served in the military. That includes serving in lesser conflicts and even peacetime. Gary Eisenhower, a Vietnam vet and president of the memorial's board of directors, reports Stephenson County is one of only five locations with a memorial park that size. Eisenhower has the surname of a famous general, and Ike himself would be proud of the job Gary Eisenhower and his fellow group of local veterans have done in creating and maintaining the park.


   


  The park is both large and impressive. The names of more than 14,000 veterans are inscribed on 19 6-by-6-foot black granite structures known as "walls." Each of the walls, weighing 4,500 pounds, is made of the same black granite that make up the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington and is mined in India.


   


  The walls cover the eras of the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, lesser conflicts and peacetime. Viewed from the parking lot they are lined up in an inverted V from the beginning of the county until today. There is room for more walls and more names on some of the existing walls. Eisenhower said he adds an average of 50 to 100 new names every six months. For example, he knows they don't have the names of all the World War II vets. Eisenhower said any veteran who has not placed his or her name on the walls should contact him. "Do it while you are still alive and can see it," he said.


   


  The walls are only part of the memorial, however. It also features flagpoles bearing the flags of the United States, state of Illinois, Stephenson County, POW-MIA, U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard. There is also a Gold Star Memorial, a Blue Star Service Garden, a donor wall, a Police Memorial Star, a Firemen's Memorial Maltese Cross, park signage walls on the east and west sides of the memorial, and a Memorial Brick Garden with red brick donor names. A total of 28 benches and 28 trees also grace the property. There is also a 20-by-20-foot maintenance building. All the maintenance is handled by Eisenhower and other volunteers.


   


  Work on planning the park began in 1999 following the death from Gulf War Syndrome of Sgt. Dan Steele. Steele had attended a dedication of a similar park in Iowa with members of his unit. When he returned, he said he wanted to do something here. "The idea came from Dan," Eisenhower said. Steele is remembered with a marble marker in the park.


   


  It took until 2005 to raise funds for the park and find a location for it before a groundbreaking was held. Stephenson County made the land adjacent to the nursing home available because it wasn't needed for anything. While the county still owns it, "We have a written agreement that is always going to be a memorial park for veterans," said Eisenhower. If veterans can no longer maintain it, the county will take that over.


   


  The park has been built in stages from the groundbreaking until a final dedication was held in 2013. Other dedications were in 2007 and 2009 for different stages of completion. However, despite efforts to publicize it, a lot of people don't seem to realize the memorial park exists, said Eisenhower.


   


  The park's value is estimated at $900,000. All its funding has come from donations. "The park was built by what I say is divine intervention," Eisenhower said. "I really believe that. We were on a shoestring budget and every time we had a concept or an idea we'd pray about it and a couple days or a week later someone would show up and ask if there was anything they could sponsor. Everything in that park is sponsored by an individual, a family, a veteran's organization, fraternal organization, that's how the whole park was built and paid for. All the walls were sponsored by organizations." Donations are still accepted and may be sent to AVMP, PO Box 804, Freeport, IL 61032.


   


  Eisenhower has been the veteran organization's president for the past 10 years but all he is, he says, is the guy driving the bus.


   


  "Everybody in the bus that I'm driving for a project has the same convictions and the same thought process. They want to make it come to fruition. All I'm doing is driving us there to get the job done."

Anil Kumar Verma, director, Centre for the Study of Society and Politics, Kanpur, writing for Outlook recently, pinpoints the late '70s-'80s as a time of churn in UP politics. "That was the time when Dalit and backward assertion…came to dominate the state. Its political avatars [in the form of BSP and SP] gave patronage to such criminal elements because they had to build their parties from scratch. At that juncture, criminality was amalgamated with caste identity so that marginalised caste groups would see their criminal- politicians as a symbol of 'caste pride'.

Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, if elected to power in the November elections, will help shape international bodies like the United Nations so that India get a permanent seat on the Security Council, a former top American diplomat has said.


  India has been pushing for reforms of the United Nations, including the Security Council, stating that its composition doesn’t reflect the current realities and is not representative enough.


  The UNSC has 15 members, including five permanent members — the U.S., the U.K., France, Russia and China. China is the only permanent member of the UNSC which is opposed to India’s inclusion into the powerful grouping. Half of the 10 non-permanent members are elected every year for a two-year term. India, along with Mexico and Ireland, has been recently elected a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021.


  “There’s no question that under his (Biden) leadership, he would help shape international institutions like the UN to give India a (permanent) seat on the Security Council, he would fulfil its (India) status as a major defence partner,” former U.S. Ambassador to India Richard Verma said on Saturday.


  “He (Biden) would work together with India to keep our citizens collectively safe. That means standing up against cross-border terrorism and standing with India when its neighbours attempt to change the status quo,” he added.


  Mr. Verma, an Indian-American who was U.S. ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017, joined three other prominent Indian-Americans to make a pitch for the small but highly influential community to support and vote for Joe Biden in the U.S. presidential elections.


  The 77-year-old former U.S. vice president is set to be formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August. He will challenge 74-year-old incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican in the November 3 presidential elections.


  Mr. Verma, Biden Unity Task Force Economic Policy advisor Sonal Shah, former U.S. surgeon general Vivek Murthy and Centre for American Progress Action Fund CEO Neera Tanden in their address to a virtual event argued that over the past several decades, Mr. Biden has a proven track record of being the best friend of Indians and Indian-Americans, be it as a Senator from Delaware or as a vice president under the Obama administration.


  “There’s no question president Biden would build a more inclusive, tolerant just and fair administration that would take US-India relations to new heights,” Mr. Verma said at the event — ‘An Electorate Coming of Age: Indian Americans for Biden Community Town Hall’


  He urged the Indian-American community to make Joe Biden’s dream of making India and the U.S. the two closet nations in the world a reality.


  “I can confidently say, there would have been no US India Civil Nuclear Deal but for Joe Biden,” Mr. Verma said.


  “In 2006, I remember the remarks he made where he said, ‘My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States. If that occurs, the world will be safer.’ Think about that for a second. He made those remarks in 2006. And here we are, it’s 2020. Let’s make Joe Biden’s dream a reality. That only becomes a reality if he becomes president,” he said.


  In her address, Neera Tanden urged Indian-Americans to take steps every day over the next three-and-a-half months to ensure that Biden becomes the president.


  Sonal Shah said she will vote for Biden as she wants a country that is open to people like her, to her friends, to her colleagues and to everyone else.


  “We are not just immigrants, we are not just people sitting on the side, we are part of that American fabric and welcome us to help create that fabric because we’ve been lucky enough to be able to do that. But it took people like Joe Biden to allow us and help us participate and give us those chances. We’ve benefited from that. So now I vote because I believe he is the right person, and we can build that country together with him,” she said.


  According to Dr Murthy, Joe Biden’s recognition and appreciation for immigrants and for communities like Indian-Americans is forming an incredibly important part of the backbone of the United States of America.


  “This is a moment for our country when leadership matters, when values matter. When we go to the voting booth, as we think about how to build support for the candidate that will best reflect our vision and our hopes and our dreams. Let’s lead with our values. Let’s vote for the person who understands us,” he said at the event organised jointly by the Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) for Biden, the AAPI Victory Fund and South Asians for Biden.


  Later in a statement, Ajay Jain Bhutoria, who is on National Finance Committee for Biden, said, “Most Indian-Americans would say without hesitation that Biden would be a better president and world leader and better for India on all counts.”


  “The choice is clear for voting in November 2020. The choice is even clearer for Indo Americans and South Asians. Biden is the best answer for India and Indian-Americans. The Indian community sees him as one of ‘our’ leaders,” he said.

HOT SPRINGS -- The newly appointed Miss Arkansas Alyse Eady, clad in a slimming sleeveless number and teetering on T-strap heels, pranced out of the Austin Hotel after her first news conference Sunday and ducked into her brand- new, bright-red Chevrolet Camaro, careful not to knock the sparkling crown off her head. "This red is perfect," Eady, 22, squealed as she grabbed the steering wheel and turned the ignition. After a full morning of photos and interviews, Eady was ready to speed off -- not only in her new carriage, but in her reign as Miss Arkansas 2010. Eady was crowned Miss Arkansas after Saturday night's three-hour pageant finale, which opened with 44 contestants and a full audience of supporters, all eager to hear who would represent the state at Miss America in Las Vegas on Jan. 15. By the end of the night, about $75,000 in scholarships and countless awards were doled out, but only one crown. In addition to $50,000 in gifts, Eady received $20,000 in scholarship money for graduate school.

In fact, this would provide the country with a desperately-sought four-year period of adult supervision to be then followed by open contests through which both parties can choose their direction and presumably elevate a newer generation.


  Biden would exit the stage at age 82 and allow a bevy of Democratic talent to come to the fore and a new agenda to emerge. Based on what we saw in the January and February contests, there will be no shortage of able contenders. On the GOP side, they will have four long years to sort through the Trump post-mortem and decide what it means to be a Republican in the aftermath.


  The process can be a necessary and healthy one on both sides.


  Vice President Condoleezza Rice will have performed noble service, but it is almost impossible to imagine her a 2024 contestant, not being a Democrat and being regarded as a deserter among Republicans.


  Despite some transitory howls from the left and the ultra-partisan, think of the optics of a break-the-mold Biden-Rice ticket. Imagine the advertising visuals of him having grown up amidst the Scranton mills and her in the shadow of the Birmingham church bombing.


  Such a ticket would constitute an earnest, open invitation to Republicans to join in not only defeating Donald Trump, but in administering the total, cleansing repudiation that is warranted and required.


  There is winning and then there is governing. Biden can well defeat Trump by painting within the lines. Depending on the complexion of the Senate, he may even succeed briefly in passing a few agenda items off the Democratic wish- list. But those well-worn lines will render him no more lasting success than other recent presidents have found in altering America’s poisoned, hyper- polarized, dysfunctional politics.


  Anyone think it might be time to look outside those lines?


  This virus may be only a half-year old, but the calamity in which America finds itself has been a long time coming. It did not start with Trump, though he has magnified it immeasurably. There is public policy to be made in a Biden administration. But the far bigger task is one of healing, restoration and righting a teetering republic in crisis.


  What little Biden would sacrifice in party politics or even in willingly announcing himself a lame duck, he would more than make up for in moral authority. That is an invaluable commodity, and one these days thought of as a quaint notion or foreign object.


  Back to those visuals, jump ahead to early next February and President Biden’s first State of the Union speech. In keeping with this time of historical reckoning and redress, picture Biden at the lectern of the House chambers with directly behind him the bipartisan but decidedly black tandem of Vice President Condi Rice and newly-installed Speaker Hakeem Jeffries.


  That would be indeed historic — on multiple levels. Does Joe Biden have it in him to rise to the occasion?

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday he was "absolutely confident" in allegations by the UK and its allies that Russia targeted labs conducting coronavirus research, branding the behaviour "outrageous and reprehensible".


  Britain, the United States and Canada on Thursday accused a hacking group called APT29 of spearheading the online attacks on various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development.


  They said the collective is "almost certainly" linked to Russian intelligence, and intended to steal information and intellectual property.


  Moscow quickly rejected the accusations as "groundless", and its ambassador to London said in a British television interview Sunday the claims made "no sense".


  However, Raab reiterated that the trio's conclusions were based on assessments by Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and its counterparts in the US and Canada.


  "We're absolutely confident that the Russian intelligence agencies were engaged in a cyber attack on research and development efforts in organisations in this country and internationally with a view either to sabotage or to profit," he told Sky News.


  "At the time that the world has come together to try and tackle COVID-19... I think it's outrageous and reprehensible that the Russian government is engaged in this activity."


  However Andrei Kelin, who was appointed Moscow's top envoy in Britain last November, ridiculed the claims in a BBC interview.


  "I don't believe in this story at all, there is no sense in it," he told the Andrew Marr Show, adding he had learned about the hacking collective's existence from British media reports.


  "In this world, to attribute any kind of computer hackers to any country, it is impossible."


  \- 'Spy story' -


  Kelin also rejected a separate claim by London that "Russian actors" sought to disrupt last year's UK general election.


  Raab said Thursday that perpetrators in Russia had circulated leaked trade documents between Britain and the United States, in a bid to sow greater division in the contest.


  "I do not see any point in using this subject as a matter of interference," Kelin said.


  "We do not interfere at all. We do not see any point in interference... we will try to settle relations and to establish better relations than now."


  Russia and Britain have been at loggerheads since Moscow was accused of trying to kill double agent Sergei Skripal with a powerful military-grade nerve agent in 2018.


  The attack in Salisbury, southwest England, came 12 years after the radiation poisoning of former spy Alexander Litvinenko in London.


  Again, Russia has denied involvement and Kelin said the country is ready to move on from the controversies.


  "We still don't understand why some spy story should disrupt this important business relationship," he added.


  "We are prepared to turn the page and we are prepared to do business with Britain."

Pilot left Jaipur for Delhi and several of his loyalists followed; checking in to a five star hotel in Gurgaon. Coming just four months after Jyotiraditya Scindia pulled a similar move that eventually brought down the Congress-led Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh, Pilot's sudden flight triggered rumours that he was preparing for a saffron waltz too. A day later, on July 12, as Gehlot huddled to contain the raging desert storm, Pilot told some mediapersons that he "will not join the BJP". If there were few takers for Pilot's assertion, it was because a close aide of the deputy CM had simultaneously circulated a message on a WhatsApp group claiming that the Tonk legislator had the support of 30 MLAs and the Gehlot government was in a minority. The mixed signalling led Congress leaders Avinash Pande, Randeep Surjewala and Ajay Maken--dispatched to Jaipur from Delhi to take stock of the crisis--to convene a media briefing at 2.30 AM and assert that 109 MLAs continued to support Gehlot and that the government had the required majority to last a full term.

ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 19th Jul, 2020 ) :Pakistan Parliament's Special Committee on Kashmir Chairman Shehryar Khan Afridi Sunday strongly denounced the Indian-occupation regime for enacting new laws to enable illegal military cantonments in the disputed area of Indian-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IoJK) and urged United Nations to take action to stop this illegal process.


  "Men, women and children are dying, being cut, injured, rotting in prisons for the sake of freedom, so that the United Nations and the international community can pay attention to their voices. Like Darfur (South Sudan) and East Timor, Kashmiris should be given the right to vote to decide their political future, as promised by the United Nations. But the United Nations and the international community continue to turn a blind eye to the Kashmir issue," Afridi rued.


  Addressing a seminar here at National Press Club to mark Kashmir Accession Day, Shehryar Afridi said the new laws were part of Indian plan to bring demographic changes in the IoJK in a bid to artificially turn Muslim dominated Kashmir into a Hindu majority territory.


  "This is a nefarious design cooked up to violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The world needs to act now," said Afridi.


  "Under this sinister design, thousands of Indian labourers have been brought for construction near the army Cantonment. Massive constructions are going around several Indian-occupying Army camps in Kashmir. Thousands of residential flats are being constructed at transit points in Srinagar for Indian Army troops. This is all in violation of the UN resolutions and its conventions," he added.


  He said India was violating International law by settling Indians in the UN- recognized disputed territory. The world must take note and warn India of its implications in the region, he demanded.

Demanding monthly or quarterly revision in diesel prices, which saw an increase for 23 days on the trot last month, a truckers body on Sunday warned that transporters may be forced to increase freight charges by 20 per cent as the daily hikes in fuel prices are making operations unviable. Fuel charges account for as much as 65 per cent of the operating cost of a truck. Toll charges are another major component, which is about 20 per cent of the operating cost. Already the demand is low and the idling of the vehicles trucks which are off-road is at about 55 per cent. It has become difficult to sustain operations. The road transport sector is devastated due to back-to- back lockdowns amid COVID-19, Bal Malkit Singh, chairman core committee and former president of All India Motors Transport Congress AIMTC said in a statement. Course correction in freight charges is definitely required sooner or later for the survival of the truck operators, he said, adding,we have no option but to pass on the increased hike to the consumers as to run the trucks in losses is not possible in the longer term. At present a 20 per cent hike in freight rates is a must for sustaining business, he said. He said that hike in fuel prices always has a cascading effect right from top to bottom and in the wake of a daily price hike, it is becoming increasingly difficult for operators to recover running costs. Losses are mounting as diesel prices have rose sharply, which has already impacted the operating costs by about 20-25 per cent, Singh said. The Last revision in diesel prices was carried out on July 17 when the prices were increased by 7 piase. Oil companies revised upward diesel prices for 23 consecutive days between June 7 and 29, pushing up the prices by Rs 11.79 per litre. Transporters demand roll back of fuel price hike reasonably and rationalisation of taxes on fuel. The Central Government should reduce excise duty while the state government should reduce VAT, he said

Another name reportedly on Biden’s list is that of Susan Rice, a substantial intellect and former Obama United Nations ambassador and national security advisor.


  But what if Biden were to think more expansively? What if he were to understand that he is firmly in the driver’s seat with a party already quite united behind him, no matter a flurry of noise here and a flare-up there, if not due to frenzied excitement for his candidacy then as a result of anathema for the other guy very much on the ropes?


  What if he were to think past the election and grasp that he is likely to be handed the solemn responsibility of fixing this mess come next January? As he ponders his selection, what if he were to conclude that it is not a rather congealed party that needs another glob of glue, but a deeply fractured nation that requires healing?


  If Biden has the capacity and inclination to think beyond November, and to worry more about the accolades of the history books than the Zoom cheers of a virtual nominating convention, there is a tailor-made vice presidential pick who meets the criteria of gender, skin tone and deep vetting.


  The moment, Mr. Biden, calls not for Susan Rice, but for Condoleezza Rice.


  Of course, you can already hear the squeals that would inevitably follow such an expectation-breaking, history-making move. “But she’s a Republican.” “But…Iraq.” “But she’s not sufficiently, adamantly pro-choice.” “But, but, but.”


  All of which Biden should answer with his own emphatically-offered “but.” As in, “But there are far bigger things at stake.”


  What a contrast that would be — a politician, in this case a would-be president, talking truth to his party’s vehement base and telling them that the national interest takes priority.


  As consolation to the Bernie Sanders and AOC wing of his party, Biden can add to this boldest of strokes by promising to serve a single term. This will assure the progressives of an open nominating contest in 2024 at which they will have a fair shot.

Jared Gibble had an array of scholarship offers to choose from, including four Ivy League schools.
   
 The Oak Grove rising senior tight end eventually gave a verbal commitment to Charlotte on April 10 and let everybody know on social media.
   
 But in a world where everyone is dealing with COVID-19, nothing is certain these days. Gibble, listed as a three-star recruit, is planning to graduate early from Oak Grove in December and enroll in college next January to get a jump start on his career at the next level.
   
 Before that, there is the matter of his senior season. The status of fall sports is uncertain since the NCHSAA pushed the start back until at least Sept. 1 due to COVID-19.
   
 "As of right now, I still plan on graduating in Dec. 2020," Gibble said. "With so many unknowns due to COVID, I am unsure how or if my college plans will be affected. We are anxiously waiting to find out if we will have a fall season."
   
 Gibble and his teammates were able to resume summer workouts on July 6 and at present those sessions will continue.
   
 After a junior season that saw him gain 2019 Dispatch All-Davidson County and All-Central Carolina Conference honors, the 6-foot-4, 225-pounder's recruiting profile rose rapidly. Princeton, Dartmouth, Yale and Penn made him offers. So did West Point and the Air Force Academy. Furman, Alabama A&M;, Coastal Carolina, Holy Cross, Campbell, Lehigh, Western Carolina, Bucknell, Richmond, Fordham and Akron also made offers.
   
 Ultimately, the choice was close to home.
   
 "I have a great relationship with the coaching staff and I feel like they have a plan for me," Gibble said. "After talking with my family and high school coaches, I felt like it was the right decision to commit to Charlotte."
   
 The 49ers were 7-6 in 2019 and played in the Bahamas Bowl.
   
 "He has really liked them since they first offered," said Oak Grove coach Mark Holcomb. "He has been down there a few times and feels comfortable with their staff. They are getting a good one."
   
 At the same time, Gibble is preparing for whatever may come his way and the possibility things could change.
   
 "Right now I still intend on following the early graduation path," Gibble said. "But due to to so many unknowns in our future, I will not rule out any options."

MILFORD - Back in April, Sarah Enquist was laid off from her job at KO Sushi & Grill in Hopkinton - a business that is closed today as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Shortly afterward, she relapsed.
 "I felt like, 'OK, the world is ending, why not?'" said Enquist, 32, who has struggled with addiction since she was 14 or 15.
 "Right now it's really hard for people in recovery because of the isolation," she said. "There's a lot of people who have had years of recovery, and they're falling off. It's really important for us all to be together, because in recovery, you can't do it alone."
 It was support from others that helped Enquist, who served in the Army for six years fixing weapons, stay sober since her relapse. People she previously lived with at a halfway house reached out to her when they heard about it, and she received support from Lisa Trusas, a 911 dispatcher and recovery coach at Community Impact Inc. in Milford who had been looking out for Enquist before she stayed at the halfway house.
 Virtual meetings held by Community Impact, an organization that provides mental health support and services for those struggling with addiction or losing someone to it, has also helped Enquist feel less alone. But moving out of Milford in late May to live at a sober home in Worcester with about 20 other women means, at the very least, that she won't be physically alone.
 "If we're all quarantined, at least I'm surrounded by like-minded people," she said. "The easiest thing for an addict to do is to talk to another addict because some people just don't understand. We've all been there before. Someone who hasn't might not get it."
 She's been there since May 31. As of Saturday, Enquist is 74 days sober.
 Sitting at a picnic table in the parking lot of Community Impact on Saturday morning painting rocks with colorful words reading, "hope" and "breathe," Enquist said she hopes people who see the rocks feel less alone in a time where physical isolation can mean life or death. It can be one of the worst things for an addict to experience, she said.
 "I remembered something that a girl in recovery had told me: 'Hope stands for hold on, pain ends.' That's what got me back. That's why I made this rock," she said, showing a rock depicting a sunny day with clouds, and that same phrase.
 The event to paint these "recovery rocks" was the first one hosted by Community Impact for Chris' Corner to spread the message of recovery and addiction awareness. Chris' Corner, a new resource recovery center planned for downtown Milford, is named for Milford High graduate Christopher Swindell, who died of an overdose at age 29 on July 13, 2018.
    New Milford recovery center to be named for Chris Swindell  
 About 40 others joined Enquist in rock-painting on Saturday, with more than four dozen rocks dispersed throughout Milford over the weekend, including some at the soon-to-be Garden of Hope at Fino Field. On the back of every rock is the hashtag #RSNP, which refers to the "Regional Substance Navigation Program," where people can reach out to for help.
 For those struggling with addiction during the pandemic, Enquist recommends they seek help, whether it's moving into a supportive environment with others or sharing your struggle through a computer screen.
 "I think addicts and alcoholics are just a bunch of big empaths that feel all the weight of the whole world, and they can't handle it," she said. "I just wanted to be able to spread hope, because hope's the only thing that brought me back."
 As a result of the pandemic forcing people to reduce physical contact with one another, Community Impact has turned to telehealth, video conferencing and phone check-ins to make up for its usual face-to-face meetings. The number of people seeking help through those programs has spiked during the pandemic, jumping from 71 in April to 101 in June, said owner Amy Leone.
 But she's glad to see more people seeking help.
 This past week, she said the center reopened to help a few younger children who were struggling with telehealth, but the full return of everyone will be a slow and steady process. Despite striving to keep everyone safe, the reduced physical contact with others has affected many who are struggling with their addiction or someone else's, said Leone.
 "All of us know that if this was happening to us in our families, we wouldn't know what to do and we would need somebody like (the staff at Community Impact Inc.)," said Leone. "If (my son) was struggling with that disease, I would need somebody to help. Because I wouldn't know what to do."
 It's what Shannon Keaney did when her son Patrick started struggling with addiction after getting hurt playing lacrosse in college. He had been in and out of rehab, and wanted to recover after struggling for more than five years, said the Milford mother.
 When Patrick was 23, his parents found him a rehabilitation center to stay at for 11 months. He came home with a prescription for Vivitrol, an opioid- blocker to reduce his cravings.
 But insurance wouldn't cover its cost, said Keaney. Without insurance, one injection of Vivitrol costs about $1,400.
 Patrick's parents fought with the insurance company for months about it, until Patrick relapsed. On Feb. 18, 2017, Patrick died of a fentanyl overdose. He was 24.
 "I was his friend," said Keaney, calling him a "mama's boy."
 It's been three years since his death, and he's remained on Keaney's mind every day since. The social isolation brought on by the pandemic has heightened her feelings of loneliness, but said virtual meetings with Community Impact have helped her, along with an online support group she helps run called "Rise Up" that meets a few times a month.
 "Find a group," Keaney tells those who are struggling after losing a loved one to addiction and feel physically and emotionally isolated from the world. "Don't stay home and in bed. Get a support system - and they are out there."

A few elements would seem to have endured since those days--the question of policing, for one--but in reality even that is not impervious to an internal evolution.  The anti-dacoit operations during V.P. Singh's tenure as CM led to the killing of at least 1,500 persons between 1981 and 1983. "Many small-time offenders, even innocents, were killed in the madness of it. V.P. Singh's brother, an Allahabad High Court judge, was killed in March 1982 and the fuming CM told the police to eradicate dacoity. But there was no monitoring happening whether actual dacoits were being killed," says Anand Lal Banerjee, former chief of UP pol­ice, who was then a young officer. Very often, it is said, police footsoldiers would risk their lives to kill a dacoit and the senior officer would later come and claim credit. Or they would tie the dacoit to a tree for the boss to come and do the honours. The idea of vendetta was already there. Take the rep­orted words of a UP cop, uttered when bandit queen Phoolan Devi was going to surrender in Madhya Pradesh: " _Phoolan hamara shikaar hai_ (Phoolan is our prey)."

The DIRTcar Summer Nationals Late Models and Summit Racing Equipment Modified Nationals events at LaSalle Speedway that had been previously rescheduled for Sunday, July 26, are now being moved to Wednesday, July 29. With the Late Model competitors and their teams already having to drive over 400 miles overnight to Clarksville, TN, from the Friday, July 24 date at Lake Ozark Speedway in Eldon, MO, the mileage to then go back to LaSalle on Sunday would prove far too demanding for each of the teams. After discussion with DIRTcar officials, Clarksville Speedway has agreed to host two nights of Summer Nationals Late Models and Summit Modified racing on Saturday and Sunday, July 25-26. $10,000 will be awarded to the Late Model winner on Saturday night, while $5,000 will be up for grabs on Sunday.

According to him, as a result of the overload on the 133 laboratories that perform COVID-19 tests nationwide in Romania, approximately 6,000-7,000 tests "remain pending" every day.      Tataru is of the opinion that the only solution for supplementing the testing capacity is the operation of accredited laboratories in three shifts.      "We currently have 133 test points with an average of 19,000-20,000 tests performed with two shifts per day. Given that these laboratories will also have the capacity of three shifts per day, we can reach for 27,000-28,000 tests a day and they can be offset by the arrival of test requests from those who go on vacation. Many of the tests have been put on hold, about 6,000-7,000 tests a day.Only by increasing the capacity of these points that we have now, 133 points, by an additional shift can reach zero unprocessed tests," said Tataru.      Tataru and Minister of the Environment Costel Alexe were in Iasi on Sunday to inspect the latest developments in the works on a new modular hospital built on the outskirts of the city of Iasi.

When Maryam Jernigan-Noesi and Mariano Noesi were expecting their first child, they recall playing a trivia game at their baby shower. They were asked what they feared most about becoming new parents.


  They answered without hesitation. "We were both on the same page and it was 'the world,'" says Mariano, a national accounts manager for an environmental firm. "It was the systems created outside of our homes that were not made for him, although he'd be forced to live in them for now."


  Along with the joy of having a child, says Maryam, a licensed psychologist specializing in children and adolescents, "there is an intergenerational fear about your ability to protect Black children and help keep them alive because of the pervasiveness and, frankly, the danger of racism."


  The family lives in a suburb of Atlanta. Today, when they talk with their son Carter, now 4, about racism, a major goal, Mariano says, is "reducing the amount of trauma that I pass on to him. Reducing it being key because some trauma is inevitable in the life of a Black person in this country."


  Their approach, says Maryam, is to start with an understanding of racial differences."We want him to first notice and appreciate human differences, not avoid or condemn what is different," she says.

You just can’t trust a politician.


  It is why we Coloradans go around politicians and pass citizen initiatives to rein in their ability to hide what they do. Politicians just hate these citizen reforms even though they have to say they like them.


  We’ve passed open-records laws, open-meetings laws, term limits, and the best we-don’t-quite-trust-you-politicians law in the state, our Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.


  The idea of TABOR is straightforward: You must ask us before you raise taxes or debt, that’s it.


  TABOR is described by one single word — consent.


  You’d think politicians would get the idea and stop going behind our backs. If you politicians want more of our money, please have the dignity to look us taxpayers in the eye and just ask like consenting adults.


  But they can’t seem to help themselves. This year it was House Bill 1420, slammed through in the closing moments of their artificially extended legislative session.


  It is an utterly confusing bill for any layman to read, written in perfect bureaucratese. Its purpose is simple enough — get more money into the state coffers without directly asking voters.


  HB-1420 will bring almost $100 million in increased tax revenue in the next year alone, of course without your blessing. It does so by changing what businesses can deduct from their taxes. It doesn’t allow businesses to deduct a lot of their net operating losses they incurred during this government- mandated COVID lockdown madness.


  In keeping with the progressive goal of punishing the most successful it also disallows some deductions for people who make more than $500,000. Class envy is all the rage these days among the political elite running our state.


  The state has an impressive record of raising taxes without a vote of those who will be paying for it. Their most favored ploy was made possible by our TABOR-hating state supreme court that ruled if politicians call a tax increase a “fee” then they don’t have to go to the voters.

Filmmaker Rajat Mukherjee, best known for directing Manoj Bajpayee-starrer “Road” and romantic thriller “Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya”, passed away due to kidney ailments in the early hours of Sunday. He was in his late 50s.


  Producer Anish Ranjan, a close friend of Mukherjee’s, said the director breathed his last in Jaipur, where he had gone to be with his family for Holi but got stuck when the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown was announced.


  Ranjan said the director had developed breathing issues over a month ago and had gone to get a COVID-19 test done, when the doctors realised that his “sodium potassium levels” were imbalanced.


  “He had kidney and heart issues as well. About 12-15 days ago, one kidney was removed. He was on dialysis and had come back to his house. On Saturday, he went for dialysis and returned around 8 p.m.


  “His wife, who was taking care of him, realised something was amiss. By the time the ambulance arrived and he was taken to a nearby hospital, he was declared dead,” Ranjan told _PTI_.


  Other friends of the director, including Bajpayee, filmmakers Anubhav Sinha, Hansal Mehta and actor Urmila Matondkar paid their tributes to the late director.


  Bajpayee recalled filming the 2002 thriller “Road” with Mukherjee and said his passing was shocking.


  “I will always remember the shoot days of ‘Road’ and how we created it while having so much fun all because of you! Will miss you dearly my friend Rajat... Still can’t believe that we will never meet or discuss our work ever again. Be happy, wherever you are,” Bajpayee wrote on Twitter.


  Matondkar, who worked with Mukherjee in “Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya” in 2001, said she was saddened to hear about his demise.


  “A talented and live wire personality who made this rare gem of a Film. Deepest condolences to his family. Rest in peace dear friend,” she wrote on the microblogging site.


  Mehta said Mukherjee was one of his oldest friends from his struggling days.


  “Rajat Mukherjee, director of ‘Pyaar Tune Kya Kiya’ and ‘Road’ was a friend from our early, early struggles in Bombay. Many meals, many bottles of Old Monk consumed. Many more to consume in another world. Will miss you dear friend,” the “Aligarh” director wrote.


  Sinha said that in Mukherjee’s death, he had lost a friend.


  “Another friend gone too soon. Director Rajat Mukherjee. He was dealing with multiple health situations past few months in Jaipur. Go well mate,” he added. Mukherjee is survived by wife, mother and brother.

Chris Windom held off Buddy Kofoid in a four-lap shootout at the finish, with Daison Pursley placing third in a Toyota one-two-three on the opening night of the USAC NOS Energy Drink National Midget Championship’s Midwest Midget Championship at Jefferson County Speedway, Friday night. The win is the third of the season for the current USAC point leader and the sixth win for his Tucker Boat Motorsports team in the last seven races. Toyota- powered drivers have now captured seven consecutive USAC victories and 22 overall national midget feature events this year. Starting from the pole, Ethan Mitchell led the first four laps with Cannon McIntosh having moved up to second, Tanner Thorson third and Windom in fourth when a yellow flag came out on lap five. On the restart, McIntosh would use a slider on Mitchell to take the lead, with Thorson and Windom moving up to second and third, with Mitchell in fourth and Kofoid having climbed up to fifth. Windom would claim second from Thorson on lap nine with Kofoid moving into third on lap 10. After another caution flag waved on lap 12, the field would once again be shaken up on a restart, this time with Windom throwing a slider at McIntosh to take the top spot. As they passed the midway point, Windom continued to lead with Thorson in second, followed by Kofoid and McIntosh, but Kofoid would overtake Thorson for second on lap 20 with 10 laps remaining. As the laps began to wind down, Kofoid began closing in on Windom and was on his tail on lap 27, only to see the final caution flag of the night wave, setting up a four-lap shootout between the two leaders with the 15-year-old Pursley joining the fight in third. At that point, fans would be on their feet as the top three began a wild shootout to the finish. Finally, as they came to the white flag, Windom and Kofoid appeared to make wheel-to-wheel contact as Windom went low. The two ran side-by-side heading into one. Kofoid would run the top side through one, then dive down coming out of turn two as Windom slid high. The two then went wheel-to-wheel into the backstretch, but Windom was able to shut the door on his pursuer. Kofoid went high through three and four to make one final run for the win, but came up just shy as Windom took the checkered flag, with Kofoid finishing just a car length ahead of Pursley for second. Two more Toyota drivers would round out the top five as Tyler Thomas placed fourth and McIntosh took fifth. Andrew Layser would finish seventh and Emerson Axsom placed eighth. The USAC National Midget Championship will return to Jefferson County Speedway on Saturday night. TRD PR
