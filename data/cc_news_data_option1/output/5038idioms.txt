Julian Tagg is president and director of external affairs at Exeter City Football Club. In this monthly column, he brings an exclusive look behind the scenes at St James Park. So, our unbeaten run came to an end and in true Exeter City fashion we brushed ourselves down and went again and boy, did we do that, with the boys securing a stunning 6-1 win over Colchester United, swiftly followed by beating League One Gillingham away 3-2 to win ourselves a place in the third round of the FA Cup. We'll be watching the draw with bated breath on Monday to see who we'll face in the next round. As ever, the football rollercoaster continues and the trajectory now, in the third round proper, is the objective to secure a date against one of the big sides for the game, which will take place at the beginning of January. Based on current government guidance, which we all know seems to turn on a sixpence, it currently looks as though we will be able to have fans back at the park for that match. We certainly welcomed the announcement that clubs in areas of lower restrictions will soon be able to have up to 4,000 fans at matches; but, because of the layout of our stadium, those numbers are likely to be significantly less for us, and it's something that Justin and his safety team are now working through. There are a lot of pieces to put together in the jigsaw, but the most important thing is that we do this in the safest way possible, and we will need everyone to be patient while we work out how we do this. At this stage we are hoping to run a test event with fans for the game against Northampton in the Papa John's Trophy on December 8 - keep an eye on our website and social media for the latest updates The Gillingham game saw another couple of goals and an assist for Joel Randall, yet another Academy product doing us proud every single time he plays. He was one of an incredible seven Academy players in the squad, with four in the starting line-up. Our younger players continue to have great success, with the Under 16s beating Crewe Alexandria 7-3 to become national champions. Next for the younger players are the Under 18s who will face Bournemouth at St James Park in the third round of the FA Youth Cup on Wednesday, December 2. It will definitely be one to watch and the club's planning to livestream it - so keep an eye on the social media. We have recently seen the number of subs change from three to five for the remainder of the season. Matt has made his feelings very clear on this, certainly around the timing of it. In any team there will inevitably be injuries as the season progresses and when this happens you call on your younger players. We believe this new rule favours those clubs with bigger budgets who can afford to buy and maintain larger squads. We will see how this new rule pans out in the coming weeks and months. It was somewhat ironic that on Tuesday night Colchester made three subs and then a further two subs in the second half as things got worse for them and then following an unfortunate injury, ended up with 10 men in the last minutes of the game. Perhaps a little more thought into the new rule is required! Over at CITY Community Trust, the running team has been busy signing up an incredible 1,500 people to take part in its annual Santa Run. They won't be taking over Exeter city centre as normal this year, though, as the event is going to be virtual. So, if you see people running in their most festive gear, make sure you give them a wave and cheer!

Did you lose faith we were going to win? I certainly did, or at least was 50/50. Man it's scary as shit to watch, but we stayed super disciplined and they just didn't make the plays with their WRs and QB. Wild to think. The QB isn't as good next week, but the WRs are much better. I know I'll get roasted for it, but these guys coming up don't drop the ball like the Seahawks do. Our defensive talent is legit though. God damn what a game. Was really impressed how much we ran the ball today and beat them up front offensively. Should be better this week even. Expect a little higher scoring game on both ends against Cards.

Parents should be putting pressure on teacher unions because they hold a powerful grip on local governments. Teachers get paid whether they are teaching in a classroom or online. There is little incentive for them to return to classroom instruction except that, simply put, it’s their job. Think of all the other workers who show up and do their jobs that are just as essential as educating the next generation. There have not been any superspreader results reported by any school system that is up and running with classroom instruction. By taking the same precautions that other school systems take, there is no reason to think that Chicago schools would produce different results in new cases.

Aus dem Weihnachtsgeschäft hat sich Dolly Parton (74) lange ziemlich herausgehalten, jetzt aber gibt es für ihre Fans gleich doppelt Grund zur Freude. Parallel zum Album ist auf Netflix das Weihnachtsmusical «Christmas On The Square» erschienen, für das die Country-Queen 14 Originalsongs geschrieben hat. Fünf Parton-Lieder gibt es auch auf «A Holly Dolly Christmas» zu hören - und natürlich eine ganze Reihe vertrauter Klassiker («All I Want For Christmas Is You») im luftigen Country-Gewand. Neben Gaststars wie Schönsänger Michael Bublé oder Country-Ikone Willie Nelson sind Bruder Randy Parton, Patentochter Miley Cyrus und deren Vater Billy Ray Cyrus an Bord. Die Stimmung ist feierlich, ein wenig kitschig - so soll Weihnachten ja auch sein.

The Bharat Bandh called by farmer unions, protesting the three Central agri laws, drew a mixed response in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday with shops and offices remaining largely open, while the Samajwadi Party held protests in a number of districts and even holding up a train in Allahabad.Samajwadi Party leaders sat on a silent protest near the statue of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh at the Vidhan Bhavan in Lucknow in support of the bandh. SP MLCs Rajpal Kashyap, Sunil Singh Sajan, Anand Bhadauria and Ashu Malik were part of it.However, life in state capital remained mostly unaffected with District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash saying that attendances in offices were absolutely normal."The impact (of the Bharat Bandh) was zero in Lucknow as all the markets were open. The mandis were also open," he said.Ashish Tripathi, a lawyer, said it was a normal day for him and his colleagues, and it took them almost the same time their office as on any other day."Banking activity in the state was also by and large normal and there was no impact of Bharat Bandh," Dilip Chauhan, the UP General Secretary of All India Bank Officers' Confederation told PTI on Tuesday.Regional Manager of UPSRTC PK Bose said, "Passenger flow was less on Tuesday as compared to other days. However, operation-wise it was a normal day for us." Samajwadi Party workers came out on the streets of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, raising slogans in support of the 'Bharat Bandh', leading to clashes with police at many places. They stopped the Bundelkhand Express at Prayagraj station, and raised slogans while sitting on the railway track.Allahabad Superintendent of Police (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh said, "Those who tried to hold up the Bundelkhand Express were taken into custody and the train later departed. Our teams are patrolling railway and bus stations and important places. So far, there has been no blockade of traffic and all markets are open." Abhilash Basak, who runs a tour and travel agency in Allahabad, said, "Almost all the shops in the Civil Lines area are open and it is a normal day for us. Heavy police force has been deployed in the area." Around 14 Samajwadi Party leaders in Banda were put under house arrest, while in Chitrakoot district, some SP workers who tried to stage a protest were arrested, police said. Some SP leaders in Mahoba were under house arrest from Monday itself. The call for bandh did not evoke any response in Amethi and Kaushambi as shops were open and business activities were normal. Shops remained open in Hamirpur, Jalaun and Lalitpur as well. In Bundelkhand the response to the call for bandh was partial and in Mau shops remained closed.In Mainpuri, lawyers abstained from work and the business at the wholesale grain market was affected, while for other establishments in the district it was a normal day.In Aligarh, hundreds of farmers squatted on a road leading to the Yamuna Expressway and blocked traffic for several hours. Samajwadi Party leader and former Lok Sabha MP from Aligarh Brijendra Singh and a group of party workers were arrested when they squatted a the crossing on the Exhibition Road in solidarity with the protesting farmers, police said.Despite some protests by SP and Congress workers in Gorakhpur, shops were open and traffic was as usual, while there was normal attendance in private and government offices. Police said that some political leaders and workers were detained for maintaining law and order.City Magistrate Abhinav Ranjan Srivastav said, "All markets were open and police and administrative officials were vigilant. Some people who violated section 144 of CrPC (which prevents assembly of five or more people at one spot), were detained to maintain law and order." SP leader and former minister Arvind Singh Gope told PTI that he has been put under house arrest in Barabanki. Senior Congress leader Pradeep Mathur also claimed that he has been arrested along with many party workers in Mathura.There were also reports of Congress leaders and workers being put under house arrest or getting arrested in Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Ghazipur, Chitrakoot, Saharanpur and Kanpur. A senior state government official, however, asserted that the situation was peaceful in the state.Rashtriya Kisan Manch president Shekhar Dixit alleged that instead of resolving problems faced by the farmers, attempts were being made to blame them."This will prove costly," he warned.Dixit alleged that the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government never reached the farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh."The government has to revamp its style of working, otherwise the issue of doubling the income of the farmers will only remain a day dream," he said.Agitating farmer unions have given a call for a nationwide strike on Tuesday to press for the repeal of the Centre's agri laws with almost all opposition parties and several trade unions backing the it and many announcing parallel protests in support of the farmers.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

Yılda 100 Hayırsever kampanyası ile Gaziantep'te hayırseverlerin destekleri ile okullar yapmaya çalıştıklarını aktaran Vali Gül, 'Bugün de Güneydoğu Anadolu Halı İhracatçıları Birliği ile protokol yapacağız. Öncelikle Ahmet Kaplan başkanımıza, GAİB başkanımıza ve yönetim kurulu üyelerine teşekkür ediyoruz. Çok önemli bir protokol imzalıyoruz. Bizim eğitimle ilgili sıkıntılarımız var ama mesleki eğitimle ilgili sıkıntılarımız daha fazla. Özellikle son yıllarda yapılan meslek liseleri ile beraber öğrenci sayımız arttı. Bundan sonraki aşamada artan öğrenci sayılarının daha iyi yetiştirilmesi, iyi eğitilmesi ile ilgili bir meselemiz var. Tam bu noktada sektörün işin içerisine koymak, bizzat alanda ihtiyaç olan okullarımıza aktarılmasını sağlamak bu tür protokollerle olacak. Birliğimiz, aynı zamanda okulumuzun finansmanını karşılayarak eğitim öğretime katkı sunmuş oldular. Teşekkür ediyor, birliğimizin bu örnek davranışının yayılmasını arzuluyorum. Burada yetişecek öğrencilerimizin de hem kendileri için hem şehrimiz hem de ülkemiz için hayırlı işlere vesile olmalarını diliyorum' dedi.'Türkiye'deki dört proje okulundan bir tanesi'İl Milli Eğitim Müdürü Yasin Tepe, okulun Türkiye'deki dört proje okulundan bir tanesi olması sebebiyle özel bir okul olduğunu dile getirerek, 'Bugün hayırseverimiz Güneydoğu Anadolu Halı İhracatçıları Birliği ile sanayinin yakınında bulunan Beykent Mesleki ve Teknik Anadolu Lisemizin protokolünü imzalayacağız. Bu okulumuz özel bir okul, bir proje okulu ve Türkiye'deki dört okuldan bir tanesi. Burada dış ticareti önceliğe alacağız. Halının altyapısı ile ilgili istihdam oluşturacağız' şeklinde konuştu.'Eğitim ve üretim yan yana olmalı'Toplumun ilerleyebilmesi için eğitim ve üretimin yan yana olması gerektiğini vurgulayan Güneydoğu Anadolu İhracatçı Birlikleri Koordinatör Başkanı Fikret Kileci, 'Halı bu şehrin olmazsa olmazlarından bir tanesi. Halı bizim dünyada söz sahibi olduğumuz sektörlerden bir tanesi, ne mutlu bize ki bu alanda da ülkemizin en önemli şehirlerinden bir tanesi Gaziantep. Bu konuda yapılan her türlü yatırım, destek mutlaka yerini bulacaktır. Halıcı arkadaşlarımızı bu girişimden dolayı tebrik ediyorum. Eğitim ve üretim yan yana olmadığı sürece, bu ikisi başarılı olmadığı sürece bir ülkenin, bir toplumun ileriye gitme şansı yoktur. İnşallah biz de bu ikisini bir araya getirerek sadece halıda değil diğer sektörlerde de aynı şeyi yaparak bu toplumu, ülkemizi belirli bir yere taşıyacağız. Hayırlı uğurlu olmasını diliyor, asıl bu konuya önderlik ettiği için Sayın Valime de teşekkür ediyorum. Hiçbir şekilde yılmadan bu 100 okul projesinde çok ciddi destek sarf ettik, şahsım ve birliğim adına ayrıca teşekkür ediyorum.' İfadelerini kullandı.'Daha kalifiye yetişmiş çalışanlara ihtiyacımız var'Güneydoğu Halı İhracatçıları Birliği Başkanı Ahmet Kaplan ise daha kalifiye çalışanlar için eğitimle sanayinin iç içe olması gerektiğinin altını çizerek, 'Gelişen ülkelere baktığımızda eğitim ile sanayinin iç içe girdiğini görüyoruz. Dolayısıyla bizim daha kalifiye yetişmiş çalışanlara, mavi yakada, beyaz yakada daha kaliteli çalışanlara ihtiyacımız var. Umarım bu çalışma önümüzdeki yıllarda meyvesini vererek sektöre hem katma değerde hem de verimli iş gücü noktasında çok fazla katkı sağlayacaktır. Bu noktada bize verilen bu imkan için teşekkür ederiz. İnşallah şehrimiz ve sektörümüz için hayırlı olur' İfadelerine yer verdi.Konuşmalar sonrasında, Şehitkamil İlçesi Beylerbeyi Mahallesinde yapımı devam eden 24 derslikli Mesleki ve Teknik Anadolu Lisesine nakdi bağış karşılığı hayırsever isminin verileceği ve Gaziantep'in örnek okullarında bir tanesi olarak mesleki eğitime önemli destek sağlayacak okulun protokolü imzalandı.

Several years ago, a young Egyptian man abandoned his degree in archaeology to hunt scorpions in the country's deserts and shores, extracting their venom for medicinal use.At just 25 years old, Mohamed Hamdy Boshta is now the owner of the Cairo Venom Company - a project housing 80,000 scorpions in various farms across Egypt as well as a range of snakes, also kept for their venom.Caught using a coloured UV light, the scorpions are exposed to a tiny electric current to stimulate the release of the venom, one gram of which can produce between 20,000 and 50,000 doses of antivenom.A gram of scorpion venom can fetch $10,000 and Boshta exports it to Europe and the U.S. where it is used to make antivenom and a range of other medicines, including for conditions such as hypertension.

Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. ReneSola has $319.94 million in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.31. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another.

According to LeadStories, which relies on funding from a mix of Silicon Valley tech giants Google and Facebook in addition to Chinese-operated ByteDance headquartered in Beijing, allegations of ballot-stuffing in Georgia based on footage released last week supporting Republicans’ timeline of events bear no merit. Hemingway pointed out in the censored article serving as a fact-check to the fact-check, that LeadStories merely regurgitated talking points from government officials that fly in the face of sworn affidavits from Republican observers and corroborate to the point Republican charges that poll-watchers were told to leave the room at one polling site while officials kept counting, which is illegal.

Julian Tagg is president and director of external affairs at Exeter City Football Club. In this monthly column, he brings an exclusive look behind the scenes at St James Park.
 So, our unbeaten run came to an end and in true Exeter City fashion we brushed ourselves down and went again… and boy, did we do that, with the boys securing a stunning 6-1 win over Colchester United, swiftly followed by beating League One Gillingham away 3-2 to win ourselves a place in the third round of the FA Cup.
 We’ll be watching the draw with bated breath on Monday to see who we’ll face in the next round.
 As ever, the football rollercoaster continues and the trajectory now, in the third round proper, is the objective to secure a date against one of the big sides for the game, which will take place at the beginning of January.
 Based on current government guidance, which we all know seems to turn on a sixpence, it currently looks as though we will be able to have fans back at the park for that match.
 We certainly welcomed the announcement that clubs in areas of lower restrictions will soon be able to have up to 4,000 fans at matches; but, because of the layout of our stadium, those numbers are likely to be significantly less for us, and it’s something that Justin and his safety team are now working through.
 There are a lot of pieces to put together in the jigsaw, but the most important thing is that we do this in the safest way possible, and we will need everyone to be patient while we work out how we do this.
 At this stage we are hoping to run a test event with fans for the game against Northampton in the Papa John’s Trophy on December 8 – keep an eye on our website and social media for the latest updates
 The Gillingham game saw another couple of goals and an assist for Joel Randall, yet another Academy product doing us proud every single time he plays.
 He was one of an incredible seven Academy players in the squad, with four in the starting line-up.
 Our younger players continue to have great success, with the Under 16s beating Crewe Alexandria 7-3 to become national champions.
 Next for the younger players are the Under 18s who will face Bournemouth at St James Park in the third round of the FA Youth Cup on Wednesday, December 2.
 It will definitely be one to watch and the club’s planning to livestream it – so keep an eye on the social media.
 We have recently seen the number of subs change from three to five for the remainder of the season. Matt has made his feelings very clear on this, certainly around the timing of it.
 In any team there will inevitably be injuries as the season progresses and when this happens you call on your younger players. We believe this new rule favours those clubs with bigger budgets who can afford to buy and maintain larger squads.
 We will see how this new rule pans out in the coming weeks and months.
 It was somewhat ironic that on Tuesday night Colchester made three subs and then a further two subs in the second half as things got worse for them and then following an unfortunate injury, ended up with 10 men in the last minutes of the game.
 Perhaps a little more thought into the new rule is required!
 Over at CITY Community Trust, the running team has been busy signing up an incredible 1,500 people to take part in its annual Santa Run.
 They won’t be taking over Exeter city centre as normal this year, though, as the event is going to be virtual.
 So, if you see people running in their most festive gear, make sure you give them a wave and cheer!
