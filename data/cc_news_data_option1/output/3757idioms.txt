Last week was “Smart Septic Week,” and the United States Environmental Protection Agency and Clark County Public Health remind homeowners of the importance of keeping onsite septic systems up to date on inspections and maintenance. Homeowners can protect their property’s value and avoid needing emergency septic system replacements by ensuring that systems are in good condition, getting tanks pumped when needed and not flushing items such as disposable wipes.
 “Addressing small problems and taking corrective actions will avoid bigger problems down the road,” Harman said. “By doing so, onsite septic owners protect their investment, maintain a sustainable wastewater treatment method, and protect groundwaters that serve as Clark County’s primary drinking water source.”

Mourinho was seen accusing him of being "lazy" in training during the All or Nothing documentary that captured life behind the scenes at Tottenham last season.
 Alli was linked with a move to Real Madrid as part of the deal that eventually saw Gareth Bale join Tottenham on loan on Saturday, while Manchester United are reported to be interested in the 24-year-old.
 Asked if Alli had been left out for fitness reasons, Mourinho's response suggested there was no guarantee he would get back in the team any time soon.
 "No. We have a huge squad, a squad with numbers that are very difficult to manage," Mourinho told BT Sport.

La Comunitat Valenciana se encuentra, junto a Navarra y Aragon, entre las tres primeras autonomias que cuentan con mejores medidas para garantizar los derechos de la infancia y juventud trans en las aulas, segun el informe presentado por la Federacion Estatal de Lesbianas, Gais, Trans y Bisexuales (FELGTB).
 Asi lo ha destacado la vicepresidenta y consellera de Igualdad y Politicas Inclusivas, Monica Oltra, que ha celebrado que la FELGTB "reconozca la labor que en este sentido se esta realizando desde el Consell del Botanic para implantar un modelo inclusivo" que haga efectivos los principios de "equidad e igualdad de oportunidades" en el acceso, participacion, permanencia y progreso de todo el alumnado en el sistema educativo valenciano.
 El informe presentado por la FELGTB compara y analiza las medidas recogidas por las distintas legislaciones autonomicas, identificando las diferencias y similitudes entre comunidades autonomas en relacion con las personas trans, y tratando de manera particular la normativa aplicable en materia de educacion en identidad de genero en la escuela publica española.
 En un comunicado, Oltra ha recordado que la Ley valenciana integral del Reconocimiento del Derecho a la Identidad y a la Expresion de Genero en la Comunitat recoge una serie de "medidas necesarias" para que en el ambito educativo se promueva el respeto y la proteccion del derecho a la identidad "y la expresion de genero de los niños, niñas y adolescentes trans en las aulas".
 Entre estas medidas, ha destacado el protocolo de atencion educativa a la identidad de genero para garantizar el respeto de la identidad sentida de las personas trans en los centros educativos, la adopcion de medidas para incorporar contenidos educativos sobre la identidad y expresion de genero, la diversidad sexual y familiar en los diferentes ciclos formativos y acciones de formacion y divulgacion.
 La ley Trans tambien contiene una serie de acciones para implantar en el ambito universitario, como el impulso de la investigacion sobre la identidad y la expresion de genero.
 Asimismo, la normativa autonomica establece la coordinacion de los recursos del sistema educativo y sanitario con el objetivo de prevenir situaciones de riesgo que pongan en peligro el desarrollo integral y garanticen una proteccion al alumnado transexual, estableciendo procedimientos para garantizar un adecuado acompañamiento escolar en su proceso de afirmacion, ademas de tutelar su paso por el sistema educativo.
 La vicepresidenta ha reiterado que esta ley la unica obligacion que establece es el respeto a todas las formas de entenderse, verse o expresarse, y ha recordado que responde a "una reivindicacion historica del sector, de los padres y madres de niños y niñas trans, y a una necesidad de que en esta sociedad no haya colectivos de primera o de segunda".
 Con estas medidas, ha asegurado, se lograra que los centros docentes se constituyan en "elementos dinamizadores" de la transformacion social hacia la "igualdad y la plena inclusion" de todas las personas, en especial de aquellas que se encuentran en situacion de mayor vulnerabilidad y en riesgo de exclusion.

During the Vietnam War Spec. Charles Chris Hagemeister, with the Army’s 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, raced to help two comrades wounded in an ambush. His unit surrounded on three sides by the enemy, Hagemeister raced through Viet Cong fire to help his wounded buddies. Upon seeing that his platoon leader and several other soldiers also had been wounded, Hagemeister crawled to them to render aid. While trying to evacuate his wounded comrades, Hagemeister and the injured soldiers came under fire from an enemy sniper. He then grabbed a rifle from a fallen soldier and killed the sniper and three other enemy combatants who were trying to surround him, as well as silencing an enemy machine gun that had the area under a field of fire. He then raced through enemy fire to secure help for his wounded comrades, and oversaw their evacuation.
 His sacrifices paid off.
 During the Korean War, Army Cpl. Mitchell Red Cloud Jr. was the first to sound the alarm when Chinese Communist forces approached his unit’s position. He stood up as the enemy approached and fired his automatic rifle into the charging Chinese forces. He managed to give his fellow soldiers time to prepare their defenses against the assault. Severely wounded by enemy fire, he regained his feet, wrapped his arm around a tree and kept firing until he was killed.
 His sacrifices paid off.
 For their selfless acts of heroism, these men all were presented with the Medal of Honor.

 Our backs are against the wall. We are pinned in a corner. We are facing seemly impossible odds.
 And what are we doing? We are acting like nothing has changed, like nearly 200,000 of our fellow citizens have not died just since March, like we can live our lives as we please with no regard for anybody else.
 We are better than this, people. Or, at least, we used to be.

In light of these challenges, the Fed indicates it won’t be raising interest rates through 2023. In March, the Fed slashed the fed funds rate from 1.75% to near 0%. The fed funds rate is a benchmark upon which short-term debt is often based. As America weathers the COVID-19 economic fallout, lower interest rates induce consumer and business spending as goods and services now become cheaper to buy on credit. The goal is that increased spending will help boost economic growth.

"It's much too early to begin thinking about tautog fishing."
 Tommy looked at the man who made that statement like he had two heads.
 He quickly retorted, "What is the kid holding on the stringer?"
 I was caught in the middle of a dispute between two dedicated old time fishermen who had been catching tautog for well over 50 years. It was the second full week of September and I had been back to school for over two weeks and could not fish until late in the afternoon, after my mother was satisfied I had finished my homework assignment. Upon completion of my school work and chores, I changed clothes and headed to the shore.
 I turned over rocks and caught fiddler crabs, ribbed mussels and the occasional clam that had escaped the army of diggers and headed for the second pier. With my handline, a few spare hooks and sinkers inside the Maxwell House coffee can, I shimmied the rope up to the thick utility pipes that carried power cables to the Somerset shore then crawled out to the second granite abutment that supported the old green bridge. My target species were white perch, the feisty and tasty first cousin of the striped bass that favored that location on an incoming tide.
 I caught a single perch before the pesty choggies found me and began making short work of my mussels. I began hooking the fiddler crabs, so small that I baited two to a hook, but could not escape the voracious choggies that were tearing the bait apart with their sharp little teeth.
 After about an hour all I had was the lone perch and was down to a half dozen fiddlers when I felt a solid bite and reared back on the line. The fish pulled the tarred line around my thumb and forefinger so hard it burned the flesh.
 I fought it for a few minutes before I saw the head of a big white chinner swimming in circles just beneath the surface of the water. I was incredibly nervous because I had never hooked a tog that big from the bridge. That fish was still too lively and heavy to lift up to the top of the pier, so I attempted to drag it back to the shore via the pipeline. I was halfway there when the hook tore free and the fish swam away. I was heartbroken.
 From the time I first saw it, all I could think of was walking along the shore toward the clubhouse dragging my prize, but that was not to be. I lost my desire, but I had a few crabs left and less than five minutes later I had another heavy bite and set the hook.
 That fish gave a good account of itself and I was able to drag it over to the shore, where I covered it with sand to hide it while I crawled back to the pier to retrieve my tackle.
 The second tautog was nowhere near the size of the one I lost but it was still a big fish for that area, and I estimated it at about 18 inches, heavy enough to provide two thick fillets and a chunky head and rack of flesh to furnish the caretaker with stock for one of his superb chowders.
 Tommy's nickname was Tommy Togger, a moniker he earned because of his skill at catching bragging-sized tautog.
 Most of the old timers were still engaged in fishing for perch, digging clams and quahogs or pulling eels traps. That year the weather was mild for September, on occasion much too warm, with tautog fishing usually conducted in the early spring and late fall when the weather was colder.
 The day I dragged that tautog into the club I was wearing a short sleeve shirt and two of the younger members were pulling up to the dock with a tub full of blueshell crabs. To them it was still summer but to Tommy it was the onset of tautog season.
 Tommy asked me what I was doing on Saturday morning and when I replied that I intended to go fishing off the bridge, he invited me to join him and his friend on a trip to Hog Island Light. I had fished with the caretaker for scup there but had never for tautog. I was ecstatic.
 I am also afflicted with the fisherman's curse. I can't sleep well the night before a fishing trip, especially when I have to meet someone at an appointed hour. Whenever I have an alarm set I am prone to jump up in bed long before it rings in fear I have overslept. That was the case that night.
 I arrived at the boat house an hour before our appointed time and sat on the wharf watching the eels chasing mummies in the shadow of the clubhouse porch.
 Tommy arrived first and unlocked the door, then handed me a paper bag with a coffee milk and a very overstuffed jelly donut.
 Our host kept his boat up the Taunton River in the cove beyond O'Connell's boat yard at a place called Bessie's Beach. I soon spotted the bow wake of a handsome white boat making its way to the club and ran down the float to take his dock lines. His name was Larry and his handsome boat was a 15-foot lapstrake Lyman runabout, powered by a 15-horsepower Evinrude engine. We loaded up and pushed off from the float towards our destination.
 There was a world of difference between riding in a heavy flat bottom work skiff and a semi-vee hull powered by a powerful motor (a 15 HP engine was a big deal at that time) that pushed us along at what I considered a breathtaking pace as we cleared the Brightman, Slades Ferry and Mt Hope Bridges in short order and were soon setting the anchors just southwest of the Hog Island Light.
 Tommy filled the chum pot with ground quahogs, a few crushed green crabs and a can of cat food and set it off the stern.
 I was still unwinding my handline when Larry set the hook on a small 10-inch tautog, which was released, because when you fished with Tommy Togger all the smaller specimens and females were released.
 I recall a great morning on that beautiful boat with bright white paint and shining mahogany brightwork. I brought a towel which I used to wipe up any blood or bait that fell from the hooks onto the spotless deck. Larry noticed this and told Tommy a mate as attentive as "this boy" was welcome aboard any time. I was thrilled to hear that because the caretaker had instilled that trait in me.
 "Don't just stand around and fish. Be observant and clean up, cut bait or lend a hand and you'll receive many more invitations."
 We didn't set any records that day, but we did prove Tommy's theory that the tog were moving in. Our catch consisted of over a dozen nice tog from three to five pounds and one much larger that spit the hook just before Larry got a net under him.
 There are quite a few tautog on the inshore grounds now and more on the way, so don't wait until Columbus Day to begin the hunt; the bucktoothed ones with the beautiful smiles are now in residence.

“This is what I call true richness - a liberated soul,” the prime minister said on twitter commenting on a media report of the former American billionaire’s achieving his mission of donating all his wealth during his life.
 The philanthropy is a subject very close to the prime minister’s heart who always proudly claimed to have collected the biggest donations for the expanding Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital founded by him.
 During 2019, the hospital had received around Rs7.58 billion in donations and zakat to cope with the hospital’s needs established to mainly treat poor cancer patients free of charge. “We learned a lot. We would do some things differently, but I am very satisfied. I feel very good about completing this on my watch,” Feeney tells Forbes Magazine who massively donated to charities, universities and foundations worldwide through his foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies.
 In his foundation’s report, “Zero is the Hero” Feeney once said, “I see little reason to delay giving when so much good can be achieved through supporting worthwhile causes. Besides, it’s a lot more fun to give while you live than give while you’re dead.”
 Feeney has lived a frugal lifestyle without owning a car or home, and having only one pair of shoes. He was known for flying only in economy class, even when members of his family and colleagues would travel in business class on the same plane.
