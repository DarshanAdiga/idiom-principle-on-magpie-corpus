RICHMOND, Va. (WHSV) — Advocates dressed in black stood Wednesday at the base of the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial to voice their support of marijuana legalization, repeating a variation of, “the time is now,” in each of their statements.Participants dressed in black “in order to stand in solidarity with the black and brown bodies that have been criminalized for decades here in the commonwealth,” said Chelsea Higgs Wise, co-founder of Marijuana Justice, a Virginia-based nonprofit organization that aims to educate people on the history of cannabis criminalization in the U.S. The American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, along with Marijuana Justice and RISE for Youth, a campaign committed to promoting alternatives to youth incarceration, held a press conference promoting House Bill 1507, patroned by Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William.“Lean on your legislators and make sure that they understand the effort to legalize marijuana is here and we’re bringing it to your front door because now is the time to fully have criminal justice reform in a meaningful way,” Carroll Foy said.The bill wants to exclude marijuana from a list of controlled substances that are illegal to possess. Under current law, less than half an ounce of marijuana is considered a class one misdemeanor.A “first offender’s rule” is offered on first convictions in lieu of class one misdemeanor penalties. The rule includes probation, drug testing and community service. Subsequent convictions are punishable by up to one year in jail and a maximum fine of $2,500.Possession of more than half an ounce of marijuana is by law considered an intent to distribute and is charged as a felony, punishable by one to 10 years in prison.Capital News Service reported that in 2018, the only offenses more common than marijuana possession were traffic-related, such as speeding or reckless driving. Marijuana arrests that year were at their highest level in at least 20 years, with nearly 29,000 arrests.“Arrests for marijuana possession are significantly higher for blacks and people of color, even though data has shown that there is no higher rate usage with people of color than there are with white people,” said Del. Joshua Cole, D-Stafford, chief co-patron of HB 1507. “But yet we are constantly the ones thatare taking the brunt of this.”Virginia State Police arrested more white people (25,306) for drug violations in 2018 than African Americans (20,712). While African Americans make up 19% of Virginia’s population, they consisted of nearly half of all marijuana convictions in 2018, according to a Capital News Service analysis of court records.Carroll Foy said that African Americans are three times more likely than any other race to be stopped, arrested and convicted for possession of marijuana.Nine other bills have been introduced this session relating to the possession of marijuana. Some propose legalization, while others propose decriminalization. Although the terms are used interchangeably at times, the two carry dramatically different meanings.Bills similar to HB 1507, like HB 87 and HB 269, propose the legalization of marijuana, which would lift existing laws that prohibit possession of the substance.Senate Bill 2, patroned by Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, HB 972, patroned by Del. Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, and several other bills propose the decriminalization of marijuana. These bills would impose a $50 fee for consuming or possessing marijuna. Ebbin’s bill would raise the threshold amount ofmarijuana subject to distribution or possession with intent to distribute from one-half ounce to one ounce. Herring’s bill would impose a $250 fee if the offender was consuming marijuana in public. However, the drug would remain illegal.The ACLU said last week at a press conference that decriminalization and civil offenses still hold and create a number of issues — someone who wants to contest the citation would have to do so without a lawyer, and those who cannot afford to pay upfront would have to go to court, which usually includes morecosts and fees. The group instead wants to see a full repeal of the prohibition on marijuana.Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring took part in a cannabis conference Sunday and voiced his support for marijuana reform.“It's clear time for cannabis reform has come,” Herring said. “Justice demands it, Virginians are demanding it, and I’m going to make sure we get it done.”Ashna Khanna, legislative director of the ACLU of Virginia, said they have confirmed Herring’s support of HB 1507. The organization, along with 11 others, sent a letter to Gov. Ralph Northam requesting support of legislation to legalize marijuana and hope that he will be open to meeting with them soon.Copyright 2020 WWBT. All rights reserved.Submit a news tip.

“These companies were happy to meet that demand with no questions asked,” Hunter said.
 As the state’s worst manmade public health crisis grew, so did the companies’ coffers, he said.
 “These companies make billions of dollars by supplying massive and unjustifiable quantities of opioids,” he said. “They need to pay for the destruction their greed has caused.”
 He said the three companies collectively supplied 34 billion opioid pills in the United States from 2006 to 2012.
 Hunter said the distributors are already facing similar lawsuits in other states, and there was a previous settlement that topped $200 million.
 “Our company plays an important but limited role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, and any suggestion that McKesson drove demand for opioids in this country reflects a fundamental misunderstanding and mischaracterization of our role as a distributor,” said Sunny Rodriguez, a spokesperson for the Texas- based company, in an email. “We will continue to fight that mischaracterization and defend ourselves in the litigation.”
 In a statement, AmerisourceBergen said it and other wholesale drug distributors are responsible for getting Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs from manufacturers to registered pharmacies — based on prescriptions written by licensed doctors and health care providers.
 “We are dedicated to doing our part as a distributor to mitigate the diversion of these drugs without interfering with clinical decisions made by doctors, who interact directly with patients and decide what treatments are most appropriate for their care,” the Pennsylvania-based company said. “Beyond our reporting and immediate halting of potentially suspicious orders, we refuse service to customers we deem as a diversion risk and provide daily reports to the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] that detail the quantity, type, and the receiving pharmacy of every single order of these products that we distribute.”
 Ohio-based Cardinal Health did not return an email seeking comment as of press time.
 The lawsuit comes as Hunter and Johnson & Johnson both continue to appeal a $465 million verdict handed down in Cleveland County last year.
 After an eight-week trial in Norman last year, Judge Thad Balkman found Johnson & Johnson created a public nuisance by launching a misleading marketing campaign that contributed to the opioid epidemic in the state. He initially ordered the New Jersey-based company to pay $572 million to help fix the problem. Acknowledging he miscalculated the initial verdict, Balkman later reduced it.

Hubbard’s announcement came on the same day OSU wide receivers coach Kasey Dunn was named as the new offensive coordinator. It also comes shortly after junior wide receiver Tylan Wallace announced his return to OSU for his senior season.
 Last month, Hubbard earned a spot on the 2019 Walter Camp All-America first team. It marked the third straight year and the fourth out of five that an OSU player has earned Walter Camp All-America accolades.
 Hubbard was the first OSU running back to earn the honor since Kendall Hunter in 2010 and is the sixth OSU running back to earn the honor, joining Bob Fenimore (1945), Terry Miller (1977), Ernest Anderson (1982), Barry Sanders (1988) and Hunter.
 Hubbard ended his season with 328 carries for 2,094 yards (an average of 6.4 yards per carry) and 21 touchdowns on the ground. He also caught 23 passes for 198 yards during the 2020 season.
 He became the second Cowboy ever to cross the 2,000-yard plateau, following Barry Sanders’ 1988 Heisman Trophy-winning season.

CAPE TOWN - Five people who may have been poisoned along Wetton Road this week are still recovering in a Cape Town hospital.
 Six people were hospitalised on Monday after ingesting what's believed to have been a toxic substance.
 Kasshief Bassadien had just arrived home when a man collapsed outside his house.
 The man was with two others who said they'd been given food nearby.
 “I thought the guy was maybe drunk or he had been robbed. The guy collapsed and tried to wake him up and as he came up, he started vomiting and started shaking and then I thought something is really wrong.”
 Bassadien stopped a passing police vehicle who then alerted the medics.
 Confused and alarmed by what he'd witnessed, he then contacted community members for help.
 “I then asked people to lend a hand and that’s when they came. I asked them not to take videos and put their phones away and jump in and assist.”
 Police and health authorities are investigating.

Criminal activity imposes huge costs on black residents in low-income neighborhoods of cities such as Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Philadelphia and many others. Thousands of black Americans were murdered in 2019. More than 90% of the time, the perpetrator was also black. Leftists and social justice warriors charge that what blacks have to fear most is being shot and killed by police, but the numbers don’t add up. For several years, The Washington Post has been documenting police shootings in America. Last year, 933 people were shot and killed by police. Twenty-three percent (212) of people shot and killed were black; 35% (331) were white; 16% (155) were Hispanic and 201 were of other or unknown races. The high homicide rate within the black community doesn’t begin to tell the full tragedy.
 Crime imposes a hefty tax on people who can least afford it. They are the law- abiding residents of black neighborhoods. Residents must bear the time cost and other costs of having to shop outside of their neighborhoods. Supermarkets that are abundant in low-crime neighborhoods are absent or scarce in high- crime, low-income neighborhoods. Because of the paucity of supermarkets and other big-box stores in these neighborhoods, some “experts” and academicians have labeled them as “food deserts.” That’s the ridiculous suggestion that white supermarket merchants and big-box store owners don’t like green dollars coming out of black hands. The true villains of the piece are the criminals who make some businesses unprofitable. By the way, these are equal opportunity criminals. They will victimize a black-owned business just as they would victimize a white-owned business. The high crime rates in many black neighborhoods have the effect of outlawing economic growth and opportunities.

 Latta 45, Dale 42
 The Lady Panthers again had to come from behind, trailing 20-16 at halftime and 32-28 heading into the third quarter.
 Latta finished the game on a 17-10 run.
 Chloe Brinlee led Latta’s second-half charge, scoring 13 of her game-high 15 points over the final two frames. Brinlee also had eight rebounds.
 Carson Dean had another strong outing for the Lady Panthers, finishing with 13 points — including a pair of 3-pointers — to go with nine boards.
 Dale nearly won the game from the free-throw line. The Lady Pirates were 15-of-19 from the stripe, while Latta hit just 50% of their tries, going 9-of-18.
 Hailey Baber added eight points and five assists for the LHS squad.
 Lindy Nowakowski scored 12 points for Dale, sinking 10-of-12 free throws before leaving the game in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. Elaine Witt also scored 12 points for the Lady Pirates. Jacie McClure and Danyn Lang both hit a pair of 3-pointers apiece and scored eight points each.

Rowley did note that regular DMV records access — such as driver’s licenses and registrations — was down for a time on Wednesday, but he was unaware if that had anything to do with the Green Light Law or was just a general outage.
 The law, signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo in June, allows state residents who entered the U.S. illegally to obtain a driver’s license without a Social Security number beginning Dec. 14. The law states that the information those residents hand over to the state for the driver’s license shall not be used by the federal government as a means to identify or deport them.
 Local police agencies have access to the DMV database, though local agencies cannot tell based on the DMV records alone whether a license-holder came to the United States illegally, officials said.
 The agreement with local police agencies is meant to ensure that they "do not disclose that information to ICE, Customs & Border Protection and Citizenship and Immigration Services as stipulated in law," Janine Kava, a spokeswoman for DCJS, told syracuse.com.

While nearly 60 police departments and sheriff’s offices in New York state were cut off from important state Department of Motor Vehicles records because of the Green Light Law, the Cattaraugus County Sheriff’s Office complied with a requirement at the last minute.
 Law enforcement agencies had to agree in writing that DMV records won’t be turned over to federal immigration, state officials said. The interruption in the flow of the records — including photos used for identification and photo arrays — came in response to the newly passed state Green Light Law, which allows people who came to the United States illegally to get driver’s licenses.
 As of earlier this week, according to syracuse.com, 59 agencies hadn't certified that they would honor the agreement, according to officials at the state Department of Criminal Justice Services and the DMV. Those agencies missed the Jan. 11 deadline to sign the agreement, though they can still have their access restored if they agree to not share the records, officials said.
