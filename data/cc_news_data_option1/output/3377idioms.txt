Sony Confirms Next-Gen VR Headset Is in the Works Presumably for PS5

VACAVILLE, Calif. (AP) — Firefighters hard-pressed by some of the largest wildfires in California history scrambled Wednesday to take advantage of cooler weather and an influx of aid as they carved and burned containment lines around the flames to prevent more land from burning.“Every percent of containment is hours and hours of sweat and blood up on those lines,” Jonathan Cox, a deputy chief with California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said Tuesday evening.Progress was made on three major blazes around the San Francisco Bay Area and authorities were making plans to allow people who evacuated fire-impacted communities to return to their homes.The fires, which started as clusters of lightning-sparked blazes last week, slowed down at lower altitudes as a morning marine layer — an air mass drawn from the ocean by intense heat on land — brought cooler temperatures and higher humidity. The cooler air, however, didn’t reach the higher forest and rural areas full of heavy timber and brush.“The return of the marine layer has been a welcomed one,” the National Weather Service said early Wednesday.Amid the good news there were sobering developments.A fire in San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties south of San Francisco was 19% contained but damage assessments raised the number of buildings destroyed to more than 530.Santa Cruz County officials reported that a woman who hadn’t been heard from since Monday was found dead at home, apparently due to natural causes. They also were looking for an evacuee missing since he told a friend he wanted to sneak back in.Residents were urged to be patient by Billy See, the incident commander of that fire.“When the smoke starts to clear, all the residents get very restless about trying to get back in and wanting to know when the evacuation orders and warnings will be lifted,” See said.Authorities were working on a strategic plan for repopulating areas after ensuring that conditions were safe and there that there would be water service and electrical power for residents, he said.The massive fires — coming much earlier in the season than expected — have pushed firefighters to the breaking point as they dealt with complications from the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of inmate crews who assist firefighters.Some firefighters were shuttled to Northern California after battling earlier fires in Southern California.Tim Edwards, president of the union representing state firefighters, said 96% of the state's resources are committed to fighting the blazes. He was with a three-man fire engine crew that had traveled more than 400 miles (643 kilometers) from southern Riverside County to help fight wildfires in wine country north of San Francisco.“Between the fires in Southern California and these, they’ve been going nonstop,” he said. “Fatigue is really starting to set in, but they’re doing it.”Since Aug. 15, hundreds of fires have burned nearly 2,000 square miles (more than 5,000 square kilometers), an area roughly the size of Delaware.The blazes have killed at least seven people, burned about 1,500 homes and other buildings, and prompted evacuation orders that still affect about 140,000 people.David Serna, 49, a firefighter with the Presidio of Monterey Fire Department, was battling a fire in that county when his rented home in Santa Cruz County burned to the ground.“I wanted to get up to the house and see what was left. Got up there and nothing. It was all gone,” Serna told&nbsp;KTVU-TV.He and his wife did find a metal heart-shaped decoration from their wedding day.“All the years that I fought fires and seeing this type of destruction in other places,” Serna said. “But when it hits that close to home, it becomes almost unbelievable.”In the city of Vacaville, between San Francisco and Sacramento, 76-year-old Art Thomas said he found only ashes and melted metal at the site of the home he built with his own hands in a rural area where he had lived for 32 years.“Possessions dating back to when I was a kid were all in the house, everything is gone,” Thomas said. “Between sad, crying, laughing — every emotion is there.”He said he had left with his wife, two dogs and a pair of shorts and tennis shoes.With limited crews to tackle fires on the ground, California has been relying more on bulldozers, aircraft and firefighters from other states and the federal government, said Daniel Berlant, chief of wildfire planning and engineering for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire.About 300 National Guard troops were finishing firefighter training and were expected to be on the lines Wednesday as another 300 begin four days of training, said spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Shiroma.California has scrambled in recent years to field enough prison fire crews as their numbers dwindled while the state released lower-level inmates. Thousands more were released early as the state responded to the coronavirus pandemic.A dozen inmate firefighting camps that had been forced to shut down in June for two-week quarantines because of the coronavirus are back in operation but the total of 43 camps are operating at about 40% of capacity, said corrections department spokesman Aaron Francis.The challenge remains, however, as California heads into the fall. That's when searing weather and dry gusts have historically sparked some of the largest and deadliest fires.___Thompson reported from Sacramento.

At the beginning of the pandemic, Tiffany Cordaway’s biggest struggle was finding a place to shower. She worked two jobs in northern California, disinfecting medical equipment during the day and caring for an elderly couple overnight. When she finally clocked out, she just wanted to clean off. But she had nowhere to do that. Cordaway, 47, was homeless, sleeping in a friend’s car between her two eight-hour shifts. Unlike her co- workers who talked about showering when they got home, she worried about finding hot water and a place to clean up where no one could see her. Some nights, she just washed from a two-liter bottle of water. “I was hearing them talk about how, ‘Oh, I’m going to go home and the first thing I do is walk in the house and, you know, go straight to the shower,’” she said. “And here in the back of my mind I’m thinking, ‘God, I wish I could do that.’” ___ This story was supported by the Pulitzer Center and produced by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. ___ It’s a common misconception that homeless people are unemployed, but experts say between 25% to 50% of this population works. In the era of COVID-19, that means many homeless employees are working low-wage essential jobs under conditions that put them at risk of catching or spreading the virus. “Many people wake up in their tent every day, wake up in their vehicle every day, or wake up in their shelter every day and go off to work,” said Dr. Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and the director of its Center for Vulnerable Populations. “The type of work that (homeless) people do is the type of work that we have seen to...

In subsequent cases, various benches of the Court rapped the then government for the allocation of air waves (2G spectrum case) and of coal and other mines drawing on the same principle. Between 2012 and 2014, the Supreme Court handed down judgments, as a result of which it became almost a given that natural resources have to apportioned only through a price discovery mechanism. The governments since then have moved to make auctions a standard operating procedure for any allocation of natural resource. The argument was since the companies will pay a fair price for the resource they can have it for keeps.

Carl E. Mosher Carl E. Mosher passed peacefully from this life on August 21, 2020. Husband, brother, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, uncle, cousin, farmer, avid square dancer and friend are a few of the terms that can only begin to describe Carl and his life. Carl started the adventure of this life on June 27, 1930 in Ithaca, NY on a farm which is now part of the Ithaca airport. In 1946 the family moved to a dairy farm in Danby, NY where they remain today. By example, Carl taught his children how to work hard, be independent and think outside the box, and most of all how to approach work and life with humor and love. From putting in hay and oats, to milking cows and cleaning barn, tough jobs were turned into games to help them go faster, and during summer, often ended up with water fights in the milk house. All were always welcome, and often became part of the extended family including Sue B (and Michael King. He taught the valuable lesson that love is demonstrated by actions, as well as words. Carl was predeceased by his parents, Charles and Bertha Mosher, sister Marilyn Cresswell, brother Roger Mosher and son-in-law Jim Linton. He is survived by his wife of 69 years, Barbara, daughters Linda (Jim) Sczepanski, Mary Linton, Cindy (Lynn) Westmiller, Susan Cobb, son Jonathon (Donna) Mosher; grandchildren Shannon (Tom) Sessler, Chad (Stephanie) Westmiller; Justin (Jessica) Sczepanski, Connie Sczepanski and Gene (Jessika) Sczepanski; Ryan and Brendan Cobb, and Elizabeth (Daniel) Saracino; and great-grandchildren Leah, Emma, Ethan, Grace, Becky, Owen, Sophia, Chloe, Evelyn, and Riley; sister Shirley Ayers, and niece Cindy (Wade) Whittaker, along with multiple additional nieces, nephews and great nieces and nephews. A celebration of Carl's life will be held beginning at 11 am on September 19, 2020 at the family home, 190 West Miller Road in Ithaca, NY. The family would like to extend special thanks to Connie Sczepanski for all her help with caring for Carl and to Hospicare of Ithaca for their invaluable help and support.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — A Trump administration crackdown on nonessential travel coming from Mexico amid the coronavirus pandemic has created massive bottlenecks at the border, with drivers reporting waits of up to 10 hours to get into the U.S. An employee at a company that provides support for businesses with Mexican operations saw the huge lines Sunday night from his home in Tijuana, Mexico. A U.S. citizen, he lined up at midnight for his 8 a.m. shift Monday in San Diego and still arrived 90 minutes late. “I hope that it’s just startup fits and starts and that it will be a little more streamlined down the road,” said Ross Baldwin, the man's boss and president of the TACNA Services Inc. U.S. citizens and legal residents cannot be denied entry under a partial ban that the Trump administration introduced in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Going to work, school and medical appointments are deemed essential travel but going to shop, dine or socialize is not. Andrea Casillas, who works at a Bed Bath & Beyond store in San Diego and lives in Tijuana because it's less expensive, waited for four hours Monday. “There is a price to pay (for commuting from Mexico), but it should be reasonable,” Casillas said. “This is going too far.” The crackdown comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it surveyed about 100,000 travelers coming from Mexico by car or on foot and found 63% of U.S. citizens and legal residents traveled for reasons that were not essential. The agency on Friday began redirecting staff at 14 larger crossings in California, Arizona and Texas to get people through quickly on weekday mornings, when essential travel is heaviest, leading to big backups on the weekends. On Tuesday, traffic was unusually light, with pedestrians...

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vin Scully sat outside watching two sets of his golf clubs being loaded into a truck. He thought of afternoons teeing off at Bel-Air Country Club or with President George H.W. Bush. Those left-handed clubs had produced a lot of shots over many rounds, some good, some bad. Traipsing the fairways was a way to relax and swap stories away from the ballpark through the years. Seeing them go stirred emotion that surprised the 92-year-old Hall of Fame announcer. “Wow, there is a chapter of my life that really hurts,” Scully told The Associated Press, “but at my age and after some physical problems, I knew I’d never be able to hold them again. I heard a door close in my life.” Scully took a bad fall in April at the end of his driveway while retrieving the mail, breaking his nose and ribs and suffering a concession. “It was a learning experience,” he said. “I hold on to my walker.” He’s decided to let go in another way, though.

BEATRICE, Neb. (AP) — A body found near a Beatrice camping ground along the banks of the Big Blue River has been identified as that of a missing Beatrice man, police said. The body, found Monday near Riverside Park, is that of Robert “Bobby” Barton, 32, of Beatrice, the Beatrice Daily Sun reported. Barton had not been seen since the night of Aug. 15 and was reported missing by a friend, according to police. Gage County Sheriff’s deputies were called to the park around 10 a.m. Monday after someone boating on the river spotted a body in a wooded area along the river’s north bank. Gage County Attorney Roger Harris, who is also the county coroner, said no foul play is suspected in Barton’s death. Officials have not said how Barton died. Police had earlier said Barton was last seen walking into a treeline at Riverside Park and may have gone into the water at some point.

The man accused of robbing three transgender women in Hollywood earlier this month in what police have called a hate crime was released from jail Tuesday after prosecutors asked detectives to dig deeper into the case before they filed charges, authorities said.
 Carlton Callway, 29, was arrested last week in Bakersfield on suspicion of the Aug. 17 robbery that was filmed in a video on Hollywood Boulevard, but he was released from jail Tuesday after the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office delayed filing charges in the case, pending further investigation by Los Angeles police. Jail records show he was released Tuesday afternoon.
 Video widely shared on social media showed a man threatening popular influencers Eden the Doll, Jaslene Whiterose and Joslyn Flawless about 2 a.m. Aug. 17 in the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard. In the video, someone threatens Flawless with a crowbar as he robs her and then strikes Whiterose in the head as bystanders taunt the women.
 Investigators have said the attacker also made demeaning remarks about the women’s gender identity, which led police to consider the incident a hate crime.

One federal stimulus program that relied heavily on the participation and expertise of community bankers is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Working through banks, the PPP program has delivered more than $500 billion to small businesses to help them weather the storm. Community bankers played a crucial role in getting these funds to businesses that needed it, showing once again how essential community banks are to the customers they serve. And in response to feedback we received from a number of community bankers, the Fed created the PPP lending facility to alleviate balance-sheet capacity issues for banks that otherwise would not have been able to provide PPP loans to their small-business customers.

The trial has begun for a central Pennsylvania man accused of having killed and burned the body of his wife, who disappeared more than eight years ago. Hap Seiders, 66, of Silver Spring Township was charged seven years after prosecutors allege he killed his 53-year-old wife, Rabihan, and incinerated her body in the fireplace of their Cumberland County home, PennLive.com reported. Chief Deputy District Attorney Courtney Hair LaRue said the couple's “volatile\" relationship was defined by “power and control.\" After he was charged with domestic violence in 2011, the prosecutor said, she got into a home safe, took valuable coins and hid them from her husband in a safe deposit box to try to regain some control over her life. Hap Seiders, a coin dealer, then “lured” Rabihan back into the relationship in hopes of finding the coins, she said. The woman then disappeared, last seen at a drug store near their home in March 2012. Prosecutors alleged she was killed and her body burned “to bones and ashes.” “Because he could not control her, he erased her,” LaRue said, citing closed blinds at the home for days after the disappearance and black smoke emanating from the chimney. She also cited a drop of blood on the carpet, her DNA on a knife and bone fragments found in the fireplace. But defense attorney George Matangos called the allegation of Rabihan''s death shaky, saying there was no DNA to show that the bone fragments belonged to the victim or are even those of a human female. “The government can’t prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Rabihan is dead,” Matangos said. He told the jury that the woman saw his client as a “mark” after the two met at a casino in Atlantic City where she worked as a masseuse. After a “whirlwind” romance, she moved in days...
