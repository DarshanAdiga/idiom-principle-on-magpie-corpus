The participant then watches the rubber hand being stroked while, simultaneously and out of sight, their real hand is stroked.

  Dangerous Dual Clutch Transmission


  Melissa Wilson,08/08/2016


  Limited 4dr SUV AWD (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 7AM)


  Update: I traded the 2016 Tucson for a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee. After multiple transmission software updates, multiple transmission resets, multiple trips to the dealership and overheated transmission warnings, I just couldn't stand it anymore. Every time I turned around, the transmission was overheating, it would get stuck in drive somewhere or it struggled to get up hills. I really liked the design of the Tucson but the Dual Clutch Transmission wasn't ready for primetime. I lost a lot of money trading to the 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee but I feel secure and have had ZERO problems since purchase.

Took it in to the dealership for service, and they took care of it right away, no problem.

 Even Better Second Time Around!
 Rob,12/12/2016
 SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A)
 I bought a new Kia Sportage in 2009 without knowing much about the line or manufacturer, however they had great rebate incentives and a solid warranty. At 96,000 miles, after only routine maintenance and new tires, I traded it in for this upgraded version. After two years of driving my 2014 Sportage SX, I still enjoy it every time behind the wheel. The quality and safety are reliable and the same as I expected, fuel economy could probably be a little better, however I bought this one because of the turbo and it does impact the performance. For those saying it has stiff suspension, you are correct, because it's the sportier design with the turbo the suspension is stiffer for the sport performance and handling. The fuel economy is better when I use the eco mode button, however that's not why I bought the SX. It's a small SUV which works well for hauling kids and groceries with average fuel efficiency, in my opinion, and does the job of something expected in this range of vehicles. I've not had any trouble getting around in the Minnesota winters with it driving on ice and snow, although it doesn't like the extremely cold weather and the fuel use does increase driving below freezing. Why I still enjoy driving it though is not the reliability and safety it provides; it's because of the turbo and the giddyup with which this car moves. It's just fun to drive. Perhaps it's just me because this is the first car I've had with a turbo that can get up and go while cutting in and out of traffic or around curves without feeling like it's getting too tippy. It looks sharp, the interior features are great for the vehicle, ventilated seats are nice in the hot summer with the leather, but not a deal breaker. If you purchase this thinking it's comparable to luxury SUV's out there because it's the top Sportage model, then you'll be disappointed. If you want something still affordable with some nice perks that is fun to drive, then this might be the vehicle for you.

I so hate writing about this subject, but until it goes away, someone needs to stand in the gap. Hopefully, it will one day disappear.
   
 Not only do I hate writing about it, you don't want to read or hear about it either. I'm talking, of course, about the most evil thing in existence, the barbaric act of abortion, or better described in my mind as infanticide!
   
 It came graphically forefront into living rooms of those watching the Republic National Convention Tuesday as former Planned Parenthood clinic director and current anti-abortion activist Abby Johnson spoke on behalf of President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.
   
 After detailing aspects of her clinical duties -- including being ordered to double the amount of abortions because, "That's how we make our money!" -- she recounted in graphic detail a time that ultimately changed her from pro-choice to anti-abortion.
   
 While assisting on an ultrasound-guided abortion, she watched on the screen "an unborn baby, fighting back, desperate to move away from the suction."
   
 Most people are convulsed by seeing such graphic details but that hardly ever happens. Why?
   
 Because it's much easier to just turn heads and walk away than face the reality of seeing what happens daily to thousands of the most indefensible living beings in existence.
   
 Sadly, despite the importance of this incredibly controversial issue, the word "abortion" was not mentioned once during the recent Democratic National Convention; it's much easier to sugar-coat it and move along.
   
 In past columns I've stated I will never again vote for a Democrat unless abortion is removed from the party's platform. That's a difficult decision as I have many Democrat friends who I know are best for the position, but in honor and memory of those indefensible ones, I will not waiver.
   
 Former pro-life Democrat Joe Biden -- now leading the party -- favors unlimited, taxpayer-funded abortion on demand and recently called for abortion for any reason. That, of course, includes partial-birth abortion, possibly the most evil act known to man!
   
 The pro-abortion argument is always, "My body; my choice," but the only true choice was made by having unprotected sex. Once the female egg is impregnated, the new body growing inside -- with its own DNA -- is no longer her body, and, accordingly, no longer her choice.
   
 I've never understood the logic behind how government will charge someone with two murders for killing a pregnant woman, yet it's perfectly legal for that same woman to kill her own baby via abortion.
   
 Non-believers could probably care less, but believers should heed God's word about harming children: "It would be better to hang a millstone around one's neck and jump into the sea than to harm one of these little ones;" you can't get much smaller than a fetus.
   
 It also warns, "It is appointed unto man once to die and then the judgement." As no one has ever escaped the first part of that caveat, I'm sure no one will escape the second half either.
   
 When that judgement comes, I don't expect the excuse, "I didn't believe in abortion -- or murder -- but didn't want to force my opinion on others" will hold up very well with God.
   
 But what do I know?

The man who outweighed his offensive line could outrun defensive backs in the third level as if he were crafted in a lab somewhere in Ouachita Parish. A double take is almost expected when Spencer reveals he played running back a couple of decades ago.
 But this reaction was different. This one hit close to home. This one involved his pre-teen son, Jameion “JK” Spencer, and like everybody else, he couldn’t believe his dad used to run over defensive backs on a regular basis.
 “So when we were moving up here in Mississippi, I kept a lot of stuff hidden away,” Spencer said. “When he was 5 or 6, he found some of my stuff in the storage and started asking questions then about who and what. The biggest thing I got was ‘Oh, you were bald headed?’”
 His curiosity peaked when the two took a trip to Monroe earlier this year. That’s when they met KNOE’s Aaron Dietrich for one of Dietrich’s “Gridiron Tales.” Dietrich dusted off some old tapes and played footage of Spencer barreling over and running away from defenders back in high school. Spencer took all of his son’s reactions in.
 “After that trip in Monroe, after he got a chance to see it, it’s like, ‘Now, I’m starting to understand,’” Spencer said. “You’ve been telling me about this stuff, but now I see it.’ His questions have only increased, and that was pretty cool that he wanted to see more. I got to bring out some old stuff from Notre Dame when I was in the Chicago Tribune for six or seven weeks in a series.”
 Ask any hardcore Northeast Louisiana football fan from the ‘90s and they’ll likely give you Spencer’s entire football history. Good enough to play as a freshman, but Ouachita’s coaching staff didn’t rush him onto the field as a 14-year-old. Quickly, he became one of the best players in the area as a sophomore and made highlights every Friday night with his unusual size and wily speed. It took Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz one glance to realize what kind of prospect Spencer was, and the rest was history for Spencer’s journey up north.
 And yes, there will be some that throw Spencer’s name in the mix for greatest high school running back this area has ever seen. There’s one man in particular that can make a compelling argument. His name is Mike Vallery, and he brought a state championship to Ouachita in 1989 as head coach before leading Spencer’s senior class back to the state title game in 1994.
 “As a coach, when you go up to the board and draw up things you want to do and you don’t have to worry about whether your people can do it, now that’s special,” Vallery said. “You’re not limited to what people can do by having people like Jamie Spencer. With Jamie, you could run inside trap game because he was so big, but you could also get him on the off-tackle plays on the perimeter. He could run. He had good speed. He had good hands, so you could run the screen game.”
 Imagine how difficult it was to sit a back like that in 1991 when you knew he was already “special” in middle school. Vallery understood Spencer could help his team win as a freshman, but he wasn’t going to rush anything with his future blue-chip prospect.
 “We really talked about that as a coaching staff,” Vallery said. “Sophomore year we moved him to varsity, and he started for three years.”
 It’s no mystery why the coaching staff chose to wait. District 2-5A was sort of like the SEC West back in the ‘90s. If you go back to 1988 (when Louisiana only had four classifications), a member of that Northeast Louisiana district played for the state championship in the biggest classification for 15 straight seasons. Ouachita, Ruston, Neville and West Monroe took turns playing in the last game of the season from ’88 to 2002.
 “I absolutely loved playing (in Northeast Louisiana in the ‘90s),” Spencer said. “It was better than the hype. During that time, the area was so saturated with good teams. Even the teams that weren’t winning were really good teams. And there wasn’t much difference in the district champs and the cats who finished in last place. It was a series or two that separated them. That’s what made it wonderful. We all knew each other and all took so much pride in the school we went to.”
 As Spencer’s stature towered over his teammates in the backfield, he was a looming presence from the beginning with his athleticism and frame. But every good team has more than one weapon to rely on. Ouachita had many, but Jermaine Brown was the lightning that complimented Spencer’s thunder.
 Vallery couldn’t help but sneak an evil laugh when he recalled opponents’ frustrations in defending his oversized power back and electrifying scat back.
 “People couldn’t just key in on Jamie,” Vallery said. “Jermaine, between those two right there, they stretched the defense. They had to cover the entire field. You couldn’t just focus on Jamie because you also had this fast back sitting there too.”
 How most former coaches and players talk about Spencer is how Spencer talks about Brown. Ouachita’s scat back was “truly a lightning bolt,” Spencer said.

My father was sick for a long time, and during his final days, he talked about how I would be set for life. That was a flat-out lie. My mother and I were left with nothing, unless you call thousands of dollars of debt an inheritance. I later found out that my uncle, who I thought of as another father figure, is richer than my father ever was. He lives in a giant mansion in the mountains. He uses it to support his 30-year-old children. I, a 19 year old with barely enough to survive, was left with nothing. I struggle to help my mom pay off my father's debt. My uncle barely helps me. I feel abandoned by the people I trust most. I am barely surviving, but I am managing. I am just hurt by my family ignoring me and running off with my father's money. As a person with a lot of pride, what should I do in a situation like this? -- Poor Little Rich Girl

What I really like about the Kia Sedona SX-L is the SUV-like styling (exterior, cockpit, center console), luxury accommodations (cooled seats, soft-touch surfaces, Napa leather -- something not even offered on a 3-series BMW, but available as an expensive upgrade on the 550i), safety/convenience/technology features (360 camera view with rearward turning radius, blind spot monitoring, collision warning and rear cross-traffic alerts, proximity keyless entry/start, smart lift gate), performance (strong engine with passing power, relatively nimble handling), and value (cheaper than competition with long warranty).

The 2016 Ford Fiesta is one of our favorites, with three engines to choose from, including an extremely satisfying performance-minded ST variant. The 2016 Volkswagen Golf is a bit more expensive, but the cabin has higher-quality materials and the sporty Golf GTI practically invented the "hot hatch" segment. The 2016 Mazda 3 is one of our favorite cars as well, with a 0-60-mph time that beats the Veloster Turbo by a hair; it gets better fuel economy to boot. While the Veloster has some high points, we think most of the competition is more desirable overall.

Despite the 2015 Sedona's dramatically different appearance, this isn't the sort of revolutionary product that we've come to expect from Kia in recent years. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Chances are, you're not looking for a revolution: just sliding doors, spaciousness, flexible seating options, plenty of safety and up-to-date equipment, all of which the new Sedona provides. The crossover design cues are where the Sedona goes a step further. Kia knows a lot of buyers skip over minivans because three-row crossovers simply look and feel cooler, so the 2015 Sedona is a novel attempt to meet them halfway. If you're sensitive to the stigma associated with diaper-toting minivan ownership, perhaps this Kia will make you think twice.

 EX 4dr Ext Minivan (3.8L 6cyl 5A)
 I bought my 2010 as a used rental car with 11,000k and now I am at almost 106k. The remaining warranty was for only 60k (only original owners get 110k), and only had to use it once to replace the fuel pump at 23k, since it was giving off a humming noise. Dealer replaced with no haggle. My trusted mechanic has been maintaining it and is impressed with it's quality. Yes, it isn't the top of the line in luxury, but we purchase our vehicles for the long haul and want reliability, comfort and safety over the high techie offerings. I know this minivan will go the distance with me for another several years and thousands of miles. My other 2 minivans (1988 Dodge Caravan & 2000 Chevy Venture) needed new transmissions at 100k, but this baby is still going strong! Mine came with Sirius radio which I just recently enrolled in, I have a single CD player and one USB port and I love the backup sensors which I've never had before. I'm sure it isn't the quietest ride around, but I truly enjoy the look and feel of this model and the cargo capacity works exceptionally well as an additional truck for my husband's upholstery business. All-in-all, I love my Sedona - it has gone the distance with literally no repairs so my investment has been well worth it. I would definitely consider buying another Kia!

On the plus side, the 2011 Kia Rio delivers respectable fuel economy and a warranty that spans 10 years or 100,000 miles. However, we recommend that you check out the competition before committing. The new 2011 Ford Fiesta ranks near the top of our list, delivering energetic performance along with a decent list of standard and optional features. The 2011 Honda Fit is another great choice due to its versatile cargo configurations. We'd also consider a 2011 Nissan Versa, which edges the Rio thanks to greater comfort. With a redesigned Rio lurking on the horizon, we'd think twice about the current model, especially when you consider the strides that Kia has been making with its latest versions of other models.

So the 2013 Hyundai Veloster is not a legitimate sport coupe or sport hatchback. However, if you're just looking for a subcompact or compact hatchback with a distinct and sportycharacter, then it definitely still has some appeal. It is easy to drive, responsive to inputs and both engines deliver strong fuel economy.


  ## Interior


  Clearly, the most prominent feature of the 2013 Hyundai Veloster is its three-door layout. While the single driver-side door creates a coupelike appearance, the two smaller passenger-side doors provide added convenience for loading people or parcels. Once you pass through the single rear door (be careful not to clip your head on the truncated opening) you'll find a backseat that's roomier than most coupes but less so than most hatchbacks. There's a decent amount of legroom, but the seat cushion is mounted quite low and headroom is limited by the sloping rear roof line that places the heads of its occupants under the sun-warmed glass of the hatch. The deep trunk holds 15.5 cubic feet under that hatch.

Over the past two years Fr Sean Mawn PP in Ballinamore investigated various ideas as to how he might enhance the ambience of the Parish Church to give it a more prayerful atmosphere.   This relatively modern Church was built 60 years ago and differed from the more traditional style of Church Architecture that is found throughout Ireland.   The Church is very tall and there was a huge simple wooden Cross above the Altar with a carved figure of The Crucified Christ secured to the wall.   This was fixed to a plain very high uninspiring cold marble recessed wall in the Sanctuary at the back of the original Altar constructed of reinforced steel poured concrete .   Various options were considered by the Church Committee and the preference was for a new stained glass window. However cutting openings in the mass reinforced concrete wall would be a very expensive job and could destabilise and weaken the building so this proposal had to be shelved and the Committee had to go back to the drawing board.   Fr Sean Mawn then contacted Ken Ryan at Abbey Stained Glass Studios in Dublin for advice and a meeting was arranged in Ballinamore to discuss possible alternatives.   Ken’s late father Frank Ryan was responsible for the design, manufacture and installation of all the stained glass windows in St Patrick's Church some sixty years earlier.   The design and manufacture of new stained glass windows for above the altar was a hugely expensive project as at least three tall windows would be required twenty feet high to compliment the architecture of the Church and naturally finances as is normal were in short supply.   Abbey Stained Glass Studios had recently taken out a very tall three light window depicting The Crucifixion for the Religious Sisters of Charity in St Vincent’s Convent, Cork City for use elsewhere.   These stained glass windows designed by Mayers of Munich circa 1880 were a perfect fit for Ballinamore and after due consideration by the Committee it was decided to follow up this possibility.   Ken approached the Sisters with the proposal of the windows being relocated to Ballinamore and the Religious Sisters of Charity generously agreed to gift them to the Parish naturally with some conditions of respect for these special religious works of art.   This gift to Fr Sean Mawn in Ballinamore made this project manageable financially, but of course the stained glass windows would have to be completely conserved and restored and in addition internal joinery, carpentry, decoration and electrical work would have to be undertaken in St Patrick's.   Farrell Gallagher was appointed to carry out the major internal timber partition to house the new stained glass windows with illuminated cabinets and Ken Ryan provided his drawings of similar illuminated cabinet projects as a guide for Farrell to follow. Farrell had about six weeks working on site and with the Covid 19 restrictions very little inconvenience was caused in St Patrick’s Church.   Recently, William Malone and the Team of stained glass craftsmen from Abbey Stained Glass Studios brought the huge restored three light Crucifixion window from Dublin and fitted it above the Altar into Farrell’s expertly and exactly constructed window openings.   The project was completed just in time for Confirmations in St Patrick’s much to the delight of the congregation and of course, Fr Sean Mawn PP.

Bloomberg) -- The nuclear industry has been stalled for years now, struggling to compete with cheaper forms of power and viewed as suspect ever since the accidents at Fukushima, Chernobyl and Three Mile Island. Only two reactors are being built in the U.S., in Georgia, and they are years behind schedule and weighed down by cost overruns and political opposition.
 But now there’s a race to take nuclear power in a radically different direction in a bid to revive the industry. Companies around the world, including NuScale Power LLC in the U.S., China National Nuclear Corp. and Russia’s Rosatom, are developing a new generation of reactors, with some designs that will be more than 90% smaller than the hulking facilities that have dominated the industry for decades. One model can even fit into a single- family house.
 These power plants are designed to be faster and easier to build, and may make nuclear energy an affordable—and cleaner—option in developing nations that don’t need huge reactors. Some climate activists, while welcoming the potential of carbon-free electricity, aren’t entirely sold on the argument. They still worry about their safety. And, with the cost of solar and wind plunging, some wonder if small reactors make economic sense even with their lower price tags.
 But as governments around the world set ambitious plans to wean themselves off fossil fuels, there’s a growing awareness that closing coal or natural gas plants could lead to electricity shortfalls, as seen in California’s rolling blackouts earlier this month. Nuclear power accounts for 20% of U.S. power, a number that could grow if small nuclear sites are put in place to ease that transition. Supporters anticipate a renaissance in fission that could draw $5.9 trillion in global investment through 2050.
 “At least for now, and for the foreseeable future it’s difficult to see a renewables-only energy system,” said Chris Colbert, chief strategy officer at Portland, Oregon-based NuScale.
 Advocates say small modular reactors, or SMRs as they’re generally called, can be built at factories, delivered by truck or train, and then assembled on- site, saving time and money. Utilities can install just one or bundle several together, expanding the potential market by including countries that don’t need a big conventional nuclear plant. Some designs will also provide industrial heat as well as electricity—one potential use is in remote villages in far northern latitudes that need both.
 China National Nuclear was the first to pass an International Atomic Energy Agency safety review for an SMR design. It began building a demonstration version of its 125-megawatt Nimble Dragon plant in 2019. And in Russia, Rosatom last year introduced the world’s first operational SMR, on a ship that can be sent all over the world. Companies in South Korea, Canada and the U.K. are also developing similar designs.
 In the U.S., NuScale is working on a 60-megawatt reactor design, enough to power 48,000 U.S. homes, and its design just won approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission this month. The cylindrical power generator would be about 65 feet tall and 9 feet in diameter. That’s tiny compared to big, conventional reactors that typically have about 1,000 megawatts of capacity. And it’s less expensive. A single power plant with 12 NuScale reactor-modules linked together would cost about $3 billion, compared to some major projects that have exceeded $20 billion for conventional nuclear plants. NuScale’s first commercial plant would go into service in Idaho in 2029 if all goes as planned.
 NuScale’s design is based on the the pressurized water reactors that are widely used now in conventional nuclear plants, so the technology is familiar to regulators and developers. Other developers are trying different technologies. Oklo Inc., based in Sunnyvale, California, is working on a so- called fast reactor that could use nuclear waste from existing power plants as fuel, and is cooled with a liquid alkaline metal instead of water. And billionaire Bill Gates is backing TerraPower LLC, which is working on another type of fast reactor that uses liquid sodium as coolant.
 “There’s a race, sort of like at the dawn of nuclear energy,” said Ted Jones, senior director for national security and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry’s trade association.
 The small plants are also safer, the developers say. The key risk from a nuclear plant is that radiation could leak, but since smaller reactors have less nuclear material at their cores, there’s less potential risk. NuScale says its designs could be installed in below-ground water pools, which would minimize the risk of failure because they wouldn’t need pumps to circulate water for cooling.
 But along with a smaller size, these new designs may also have smaller and weaker systems to control a potential radiation leak, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That’s worrisome because there’s also been a push to build SMRs closer to population centers, he said.
 “You could have a smaller reactor but weaker containment and less distance to population centers,” Lyman said. “Paradoxically, a small reactor could end up releasing more material than a large reactor.”
 Small reactors are seen as a key to reviving an industry that’s far from thriving now. Construction of conventional nuclear plants is at a 10-year low. There were 52 under construction globally in the first quarter, the lowest in a decade, according to BloombergNEF. And more than 20% of those projects are facing challenges that could derail them, including financing issues and political opposition.
 The only nuclear project in the U.S. are the two reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, an effort that’s now years behind schedule and has doubled in cost to more than $28 billion. The $21 billion V.C. Summer plant in South Carolina was abandoned in 2017 after the lead contractor went bankrupt.
 Small reactors could change the equation, and the catalyst will be efforts to rein in climate change, according to Brett Rampal, nuclear team manager for the research group Clean Air Task Force. More than a dozen U.S. states and territories have moved to require carbon-free electricity grids, led by California’s plan to eliminate carbon altogether by 2045.
 While solar and wind installations are surging, they can’t supply power around the clock. That was part of the reason California, which retired 9 gigawatts of gas plants in recent years, had power shortages and blackouts earlier this month as a heat wave drove up demand for power. Closing baseload power plants can create a gap, said Rampal. “These advanced reactors are looking to fill that.”
 Oklo’s reactor would have 1.5 megawatts of capacity, would be small enough to fit inside a house and will have enough output to run about 1,200 U.S. homes. The NRC accepted the company’s application for a license in March, the first to use a new evaluation process that the agency implemented to accelerate the review process. Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s chief executive officer and co-founder, said the design could win approval within two years and it may have the system in operation a year after that.
 “Nuclear is a really important part of what our climate solutions will be,” DeWitte said. “This is where things are going.”
 But there are questions about whether small nuclear plants will be cost- competitive in an age of renewables. NuScale, for instance, is aiming for a power plant that can sell power for $55 a megawatt-hour. TerraPower is developing a 345-megawatt reactor that would have a levelized cost of electricity of $50 a megawatt-hour. It can be linked to a system that stores heat in molten salt to produce additional power at times of high demand. CEO Chris Levesque said that would boost capacity to 500 megawatts and reduce the cost to $40. The TerraPower system is expected to cost $1 billion, and Levesque said a demonstration plant could be in operation by 2028. That type of flexibility would have been very helpful when California ran short of power earlier this month.
 “We believe there’s going to be a need for many plants like this,” Levesque said.
 Yet wind power in much of the world is now about $44 a megawatt-hour and solar is $50. In some regions, renewable energy will be below $20 a megawatt hour by the end of the decade, according to BloombergNEF.
 “The logic behind building small modular reactors doesn’t make sense economically,” said Lyman.
 The shift comes as the U.S. badly lags other countries in building big reactors. Most of that market now is dominated by Russia and China, while the U. S. is “entirely absent,” according to a March report from the Energy Department, which flagged the development as a significant blow to U.S. strategic interests.
 The U.S. is taking steps to address this, notably by lifting a ban on providing government funding for nuclear projects in other countries, especially emerging markets. Most of any future nuclear exports will be small nuclear designs, according to Chris Gadomski, nuclear analyst for BloombergNEF.
 “We’re not going to be exporting large reactors anymore,” he said. “Little countries don’t need big reactors.”

LAKEVILLE -- The restaurant industry has faced many hardships during the COVID-19 pandemic, with mass closures and millions of layoffs.
 Many eateries have been learning how to adapt to the new regulations. Amiee and Brent Clark, owners of Clark's Catering, are among the businesses trying to pivot in a new direction in order to stay afloat.
 While some restaurants have responded with makeshift outdoor seating and continued offering take out, Clark's Catering opened a food truck located outside of Muckey's Liquor Store in Lakeville.
 "We have owned the catering company for three years, and obviously with the pandemic we kind of had no choice but to go a different direction," Brent said. "It was either: Do we adapt? Do we change the direction that we're going? Or do we sit back and lose everything we gained from the first two years?"
 Despite events being canceled and large social gatherings banned during the beginning of the pandemic, the Clarks weren't about to let all their hard work go to waste.
 "We just took every last penny that we had and rolled it into this to make it work," Brent explained, and their investment has paid off.
 Customers have been lining up to try their home cooked meals with locally sourced ingredients.
 Clark says that food trucks build communities for the cooks, employees, customers, and everyone involved. And they're seeing that unfold at their easy-to-find spot on Route 44 in a far corner of the parking lot at the longtime local landmark, Muckey's.
 "We even have regulars now," Brent says.
 The Clarks and their team have worked hard to create a welcoming atmosphere that serves great food, and now that many local businesses are starting to reopen, so are the events, which means Brent and Amiee and their staff will be balancing their time between working in the food truck and catering parties. Monday through Thursday, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., the truck can be found outside the liquor store, while the weekends are reserved for catering.
 And in an unexpected twist, the food truck has given Clark's the freedom to travel to many different locations to cater events and serve the food that they love to cook.
 "I've always been in the restaurant business," Brent states. "I love food and I get excited when there are options for me to give them [customers]."
 Their Facebook page and website have menus with endless options to choose from, but that isn't all they offer.
 "For catering we do all custom menus. We do have menus online but it's a guideline. It's basically, 'what do you guys want to eat? What kind of party are you having? Is there a theme? Is there a budget?' We try to work with everybody…"
 Brent says, "As of now, yes," outside of Muckey's is a permanent location. "You know, we'd love to stay here as long as possible. Our end goal is to have an actual restaurant. But this is our start."

The compliments flew out of Spencer’s mouth with ease when he talked about his coaching staff and teammates, but whenever it came recalling his own statistics or previous accomplishments, sentences slowed to one-word answers.
 “The most uncomfortable subject in the world for me to talk about is me,” Spencer said. “I’ve never been that guy. I just didn’t really look at it in that same perspective. I always looked at it as if I wanted to achieve more, wanted to go farther, do more things, make an impact in a huge way. I wanted those championships.”
 For a man as modest as Spencer to run as angry and hard as he did at Ouachita, those unfamiliar with his running style might be surprised to see this gentle giant stacking bodies on the field beneath him. It wasn’t really anger that drove Spencer, though. It was his strong self-belief that fueled his workman- like mentality.
 “It was an insult to me if I let one person take me down,” Spencer said. “If one person took me down, that was worse than any missed assignment. I’m not going to tell you it wasn’t supposed to happen, but that’s just how we functioned. If I get past that first level, you’re going to need to bring your grandma, aunt, uncle, dog, anybody else you have to make sure I’m not getting across that goal line.”
 Still, as dangerous as that duo was in the backfield, Ouachita had many questions entering the 1994 season. Many starters on the ‘93 team left in a mass exodus, but Spencer realized the Lions were going to be just fine in the spring game that led into the 1994 year. Why? Well, let’s just say the defense gave the offense all it could handle and more.
 “So after we lost a lot of guys after our ’93 season, the idea was teams would just load the box and stop me. If we finished .500, that would be considered a good season,” Spencer said. “But I remember distinctly at that spring scrimmage, I saw the emergence of our true character and heart of our team. As much success Jermaine and I had at that point, the defense shut us down. It was sobering. We could not wait to go back up against our defense. I thought that was the defining moment of the season. The message was clear. We couldn’t rest on what we had already done.”
 The Lions made the run through the dangerous district gauntlet and met Hahnville in the Class 5A State Championship Game. Unfortunately, the Lions got off to a dreadful start. The combination of a lack of focus and senseless penalties continuously dug the offense in holes it could not dig out of in the first half. That led to Ouachita hitting the locker room down, 27-7. Things got worse on the opening kickoff for the second half, as Dominic Brown returned the kick 93 yards for the score, giving Hahnville a commanding 33-7 advantage.
 “I remember looking up at the scoreboard and just being like, ‘How did this happen?’” Spencer said. “They had us rattled. I was thinking we could call it a day. Jermaine walked by me, and he said, ‘We’re not going to win the game if you keep looking at the scoreboard.’ We just starting having fun playing, and that made a huge difference. Geez, I wish I could have come out of that twilight zone sooner.”
 The comeback was on. Ouachita’s offense put Hahnville’s defense on skates for the remainder of the first half. With just a few minutes remaining, Spencer took a pitch inside the 10-yard line, broke a tackle and spun off another before crossing the goal line. Suddenly Ouachita trailed just 33-28 late in the fourth quarter.
 “We had them guessing in the second half,” Spencer said. “I knew we had them when I looked across the line and saw their defense fighting with each other. They were frustrated.”
 The fairy tale ending didn’t come for Ouachita, though. Hahnville burned clock and added a field goal late before the contest ultimately concluded on a Ouachita interception deep in the Lions’ own territory. The Tigers escaped with the 36-28 victory.
 “That game always comes back to me when I think about Jamie Spencer,” Vallery said. “We made some mistakes in the first half and got behind. And in the second half, Jamie put on a show. If we would’ve gotten the ball back with more time, we would’ve won that game.”
 Spencer’s athletic career didn’t end there. He had already committed to play for Holtz, and he joined one of the most hyped up recruiting classes in the history of Notre Dame. It was the No. 1 recruiting class in the country for 1995, and of the 24 athletes that pledged to play for the Irish, at least 17 of them were All-Americans in high school.
 That class was so highly regarded, in fact, that Spencer had a writer from the Chicago Tribune follow him around for several weeks for a series in the newspaper.
 “It was humbling and crazy,” said Spencer, who was a two-time All-State player with the Lions. “When you’re the new dude coming in, and you have that kind of attention, it puts you in a strange spot in the locker room,” Spencer said.
 As a fullback with the Irish, Spencer rushed for 605 yards and eight touchdowns to go along with 129 receiving yards and an additional score through the air. He graduated in three and a half years, which is a promise Holtz made to Spencer and Vallery during Spencer’s recruitment.
 As many highlight reel runs as Spencer had for both Ouachita and Notre Dame, Vallery continues to say his star running back was an even better person overall. And Vallery has one story to tell in particular to illustrate that.
 “So Jamie was graduating and going to Notre Dame, his girlfriend for all those years at Ouachita was going to LSU. I thought that pretty much ended that,” Vallery said. “Well, after Jamie graduated (from Ouachita), a couple years later he called me and told me he was getting married. He asked me to come to the wedding, and I said, ‘Sure Jamie, who are you marrying?’ He said, ‘Coach, you remember my girlfriend from high school?’ I thought, ‘Y’all stayed together this whole time.’ Not only did Jamie graduate from Notre Dame, but he married a medical doctor. And Jamie has a big job with Nissan in Mississippi. They both got their degrees and came back together and got married. You tell me that’s not special.”
 Spencer and Telitha Grant Spencer live in Brandon with two sons (Jameion and Johnah “JoJo” Spencer). The two started dating in middle school and have experienced the highest of highs on and off the field right alongside one another. Now Spencer gets to revisit those highs with his sons all over again.

In all other trims, the second-row seats collapse upright behind the front row to facilitate cargo-carrying and third-row access, an interesting solution that eliminates the common minivan chore of removing those heavy chairs. On the other hand, maximum cargo capacity suffers as a result, leaving the Sedona marginally behind its main rivals.

The Black Eyed Peas' "Where is the Love?" blared over a loudspeaker as 20-to-30 people waved signs emblazoned with messages calling for peace and unity.
   
 In honor of the 57th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous "I Have a Dream" speech, the "I Have a Dream Peace March and Candlelight Vigil" was held Friday evening at St. Mary's Park in Downtown Monroe.
   
 "It's been 57 years, and we have made some progress but there's plenty more to do," said Monroe resident and event organizer Azia Hawthorne. "That's why we're here, to spread a message of love, unity, equality and hope, and to put the unity back in community."
   
 Due to restrictions on large gatherings amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Hawthorne said she promoted the march as more of a "pop-up demonstration." But despite the lack of promotion, a large crowd braved a brief rain shower and blustery conditions to promote their message of peace and unity.
   
 "Rain or shine," Hawthorne said, smiling. "There are a lot of people out of town, and a couple other community events going on (tonight) like at Oaks of Righteousness and (Monroe's) Second Missionary Baptist Church as well. We have a great turnout with so many pop-ups happening."
   
 One of those people in attendance Friday night was Luna Pier Mayor Jim Gardner.
   
 "I really admire Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., what he stood for and his courage," Gardner said. "It just means a lot to me and means a lot to support my community. I don't see this as a divisive thing. It's all about unity."
   
 The positive soundtrack Hawthorne played through her phone was at times drowned out by passing drivers honking in support of the demonstrators.
   
 "How do you disagree with unity and love and peace?" Hawthorne said. "Honk and support, I love it."
   
 At one point, the group marched down Monroe St. across the River Raisin, then took the Riverwalk back to the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Pedestrian Bridge.
   
 After walking across the bridge chanting "Black Lives Matter," the demonstrators stopped in St. Mary's Park so that Monroe Township resident Katybeth Davis could read an excerpt from Dr. King's famous speech.
   
 "We are all still here, we're still trying to have a dream (for) these kids, our kids, kids that never got a chance to see or even have a chance to dream anymore," Davis said after reading from the speech. "We're living in a nightmare right now, but all of us dreamers still have to keep on dreaming. The day the dreaming stops is the day we just lay down and give up. I'm not ready to give up, I don't think anybody is ready to give up.
   
 "That's why we are here."

Oottimo risultato per il lanciatore Arcobaleno, Denis Canepa, che nel week end ha partecipato a Padova ai Campionati Italiani Assoluti.


  L'allievo di Roberto Polo è sceso in pedana nel giavellotto.


  Una ottima prova in qualificazione dove, con la misura di 64.77, quinta in assoluto, si è aggiudicato la partecipazione alla finale.


  Sia la qualificazione che la finale sono state fortemente condizionate dalle situazioni atmosferiche, con temporali e folate di vento che indubbiamente hanno impedito a tutti gli atleti o quasi di conseguire le prestazioni auspicate.


  Per Denis in finale (a 12), al termine dei tre lanci di qualificazione, un miglior lancio di 65.04, assolutamente non male considerato il contesto.


  Purtroppo la misura è risultata non sufficiente per accedere al turno successivo (ridotto ad 8 partecipanti) ed il lanciatore savonese ha dovuto accontentarsi di un comunque positivo 10° posto.

We all know sunflowers (helianthus), as they are one of the most recognizable flowers. Their brilliant color and rustic charm endear them to young and old, gardener and painter. They grace gardens and fields, blooming in the latter part of the summer. Those tall stalks not only beg our attention, but they also attract birds, butterflies and bees. I will always remember driving on a back road near Baltimore and coming across a breath-taking sight of sunflowers. The countryside was glowing with these bright, canary-yellow flowers that embellished the road for a long way. I have read and seen pictures of the fields in Italy, where you see sunflowers for miles, and I felt I was experiencing that sight.


  Each August, I ask my son Will to let me know when his field of sunflowers is blooming. I like to go and just enjoy the site and to pick some for the house. I am always curious which way they will be facing when I visit his field. It is fun to watch the young flowers turn eastward at dawn to greet the sun. Then, as the sun starts to rise above the horizon, these charming flowers begin their romance with the sun as they follow it across the sky. By sunset time, they will be facing west to watch the sun disappear into the horizon. Then by morning, they are all facing east again and are ready to start again.


  Sunflowers come in many different colors and sizes. There are the tall ones that come to mind when someone mentions sunflowers. There are also medium- sized ones that grow to about 4 or 5 feet. Today, you can even get dwarf varieties that are quite charming, only growing to about 2 feet tall. Their colors have a wide range of hues too, going from brilliant yellow to rust, brown and amber and shades in-between.


  There are also sunflowers that are continuous bloomers. This spring, I was visiting nurseries as I usually do, mask on and keeping a distance of course; I was introduced to some new plants as I roamed the isles. I always want to see what the different garden centers bring in to sell and to see which plants are the most popular.


  On my ventures to nurseries, two new annual sunflowers caught my attention. The first one was named SunBelievable or Brown Eyed Girl Helianthus. It has the happy face of a sunflower with multi-branching and dwarf in size. SunBelievable has golden yellow petals that become reddish-brown towards the base and they blend well into a dark brown center. This plant does not produce seed, putting all of its energy into making a constant crop of flowers. They are cheerful looking in the container and I was told that they bloomed all summer long. I was keen to give this plant a try.


  When I purchased them, they had a few blooms and I assumed as the plant grew, I would see more. They have looked nice all summer, but now they are about to explode with even more blooms. I was content with the number I was getting, but in a week, I will have a bush with even more flowers covering the plant at a time when other flowers are starting to fade.


  Shortly after finding SunBelievable, I was visiting another nursery and I spotted another dwarf sunflower that was bright, clear yellow. It was named Sunfinity. This plant was about 18 inches tall with yellow, daisy-looking flowers that were quite cheerful looking. This plant was developed to give the home gardener colorful, long-lasting sunflower looking blooms that are smaller and bloom over several months. Sunfinity was created to have many stems with a multitude of blooms to flower all season long. This was a unique and different way to look at sunflowers.


  They do not have the large heads of what I think of as traditional sunflowers - the bloom is only about 3 inches wide. However, the number of blooms and the length of time they have flowers make up for the size.


  There are companies that specialize in all the new and exciting sunflowers and catalogs to tempt you. You can save your seeds, but remember that cross- pollination could have occurred and you might not get a flower that is exactly like the one you collected seed from. It is best to purchase new fresh seeds each year if you want a particular looking sunflower. Sunflowers are a joy to grow, and I hope I always have some to greet the morning and to brighten the countryside.

  Although the base SE trim has an enticingly low price, the 2.0-liter engine it's saddled with is reason enough to upgrade. This was also the base motor in the previous Tucson, and we didn't especially like it then, either, finding both its refinement and its performance to be lacking. The turbocharged engine, on the other hand, is peppy and smooth, and it gets better gas mileage to boot. The turbo's only downside is its exclusive automated manual transmission, which sometimes produces harsh upshifts and exhibits a slight delay when moving from a stop.

BLACKSBURG — Virginia Tech moved closer last week toward realizing construction projects that will revamp parts of campus.


  The university’s Board of Visitors on Tuesday gave the green light for Tech to demolish Femoyer Hall, a brick academic building at 280 Stanger St.


  Built in 1949 as a residence hall, Femoyer currently houses a tutoring and study center for undergraduates as well as the Naval ROTC unit. The university said Femoyer has had no major renovations since it was first constructed and that the building has a mounting maintenance backlog.


  Tech will replace Femoyer with a 56,500-square-foot residence hall with 313 beds. Construction of the residence hall, which will provide housing for members of the Corps of Cadets, is slated to begin sometime early next year.

At a relaxed pace, both the base and Turbo models are reasonably capable around turns. However, if you start pushing the car harder on twisty back roads, you'll notice that it's not as sharp or refined as most rivals. In addition, the steering is overly light and not especially communicative, and the suspension is easily upset by bumps and ruts. This translates to a harsh ride in normal driving situations. Hyundai says it has made improvements to the suspension and steering on the new Turbo R-Spec model. We haven't yet tested the 2014 Hyundai Veloster Turbo R-Spec, but we'll update this review once we have.


  ## Interior


  The most prominent feature of the 2014 Hyundai Veloster is its three-door layout. While the single driver-side door creates a coupelike appearance, the two smaller passenger-side doors provide added convenience for loading people or parcels. Once you pass through the single rear door (and be careful not to clip your head on the truncated opening), you'll find a backseat that's roomier than most coupes but less spacious than most hatchbacks. There's a decent amount of legroom, but the seat cushion is mounted quite low and headroom is limited by the sloping rear roof line that places the heads of its occupants under the sun-warmed glass of the hatch. The deep trunk holds 15.5 cubic feet under that hatch. With the seats folded down, maximum cargo capacity is 34.7 cubes. That's respectable if you're comparing the Veloster to two-door coupes, but most compact hatchbacks have at least 10 additional feet of space.

Even with its larger overall dimensions, the Tucson still falls a bit short in terms of cargo capacity. Its 31 cubic feet of space with the rear seats raised and 61.9 cubic feet with them lowered is considerably more than before, but on paper, the cargo area remains among the smallest in the segment. Numbers can be a bit deceiving, however. Compared to the likes of the Ford Escape or Jeep Cherokee, the Tucson's cargo area is wider and easier to load, with the added bonus of a floor that can be lowered an additional 2 inches for some extra space.

MARSHFIELD -- Horse racing, which became a major event at the Marshfield Fair shortly after World War II, is long gone, but for many, the memories of the thundering herd pounding around the half-mile bullring track linger. They always seem to surface at this time of year.
 "I had an uncle who came down from Boston on the weekends of the fair and he loved to play the ponies," said Bill Frugoli, 88, who went to the fair when he was a child.
 Frugoli, auditor for the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, the nonprofit that operates the fair, has many warm memories of days spent in the grandstand watching the races with his uncle.
 "He always bet on the gray horses," Frugoli said, laughing as he remembers how overwhelmed the man was when, during one race, every horse was gray.
 Be it horses, Model-A Fords, or Brockton-built Marsh and Metz motorcycles, racing was a fixture in Marshfield since the fair opened in 1867. In 1912, Thomas Lawson built a track and grandstand. In 1934, pari-mutuelgambling was legalized in the state and it was off to the races.
 Even though he was too young to gamble, Frugoli and his friends would always find a sympathetic adult to place a bet for them.
 "We never won big money," he said. "We might have won 20 cents in the end."
 The fair's 10-day mid-August meet was a loosely run operation, a sort of mom- and-pop affair. Frugoli said horses that lost were often given away at the end of the meet. One man even "claimed a few" for his daughter.
 "I was a little tyke, but I remember being able to go horseback riding on one of those horses," he said. "The story that went around was, don't ring a bell when you're riding or it'll take off."
 Carleton Chandler, longtime secretary of the fair, said horse racing in Marshfield was part of a circuit with the other fairs in Massachusetts, including Weymouth, Brockton, Great Barrington and Northampton.
 "It was a whole different crowd," Chandler said. "In Marshfield, it was great, you had people come down from Boston, the metro area, and rent houses for the week or two weeks of the fair and bring the whole family down. It was like a vacation for them."
 Kids would hit the midway while the grownups tried their luck at the betting window.
 The fair runs in the Chandler family's blood. Carleton's father, Russell, moved to Marshfield in 1938 and became the fairgrounds' announcer the next year, using equipment from his radio shop. He was perhaps best-known for calling the horse races from the infield, a duty he took on in 1961 and kept for 26 years. Carleton Chandler worked alongside his father and others to orchestrate the event.
 Lenny LaForest, a retired Marshfield police sergeant and president of the Marshfield Agricultural and Horticultural Society, first started working at the fair in the late 1950s. He swept floors that were littered with losing betting slips, and worked the beer stand alongside Chandler.
 "People still tell me, 'I remember going to see the horses,'" he said.
 One particular Sunday is etched in LaForest's memory. Trotters were coming around the first turn and one horse bumped into another as the jockey was holding the reins in the sulky, a two-wheeled cart.
 "All of the sudden, the horse and the jockey and the carriage are all over the inside rail," he said. "The horse was spooked."
 Cars were all parked on the infield oval surrounded by the track.
 "The horse and the carriage went down through all the cars, just bouncing through," LaForest said. "They must have gotten two-thirds of the way through when the horse went upside-down between a couple of cars. The best part about it was they got the horse out. The horse was fine, and the carriage was a little worse for wear. The jockey was fine too."
 To many who grew up on the South Shore, horse racing at the Marshfield Fair marked the end of the summer. It was the place to gather to have one last blast before fall set in and the kids went back to school.
 The Marshfield races had history and personality. Photo-finish prints, fastened to a wire, were sent past the heads of bettors from the top of the grandstand to the steward's stand on the opposite side of the track. The jockeys and the trainers at Marshfield were either youngsters on their way up or veterans on their way down. After a race, the jockeys had to walk through a crowd of race fans who critiqued their ride in colorful language.
 Racing ended at Marshfield in 1991 after a conflict with the newly opened track in Foxborough. The state racing commission awarded Marshfield's dates to Foxborough and moved Marshfield's meet back two weeks. Such a move would have been a potential killer for Marshfield because the fair would have found it hard to survive with the kids back in school. The result was a fatal blow to racing at Marshfield.
 Losing horse racing's seven hours of daily entertainment forced Marshfield Fair to reinvent itself. Instead of a 10-race card each day, it now features demolition derbies, stunt shows, brightly colored midway games, thrilling carnival rides, agricultural exhibits, 4-H shows, rodeo events and a blues music festival. The fair typically draws about 150,000 people over 10 days to its grounds off Route 3A. However, this year's Marshfield Fair has been canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We've been able to transform ourselves," Chandler said. "With our strong agriculture presence, it's worked out very good for us. That part has been very positive."
 Between the stables, track, grandstand and jockey area, the infrastructure required to pull off the sport of kings took up half of the space on the fairgrounds, Chandler said.
 Now that the fair has regained all that acreage, Chandler said he isn't sure what he would do without it.
 "Now looking back, I wonder how we put the fair on when we didn't have any of this room," Chandler said.

Six years ago Jim Garman gave his wife, Michelle, a beehive for Christmas to cure her fear of bees. As it turns out, his cheeky gift delivered. What's more, it sparked a passion for the spunky, Newport-based couple that continues to this day.
 "This year, we have nine hives," says Michelle, who runs an 8-acre sustainable farm with Jim in Middletown. "Every year, we get a few more. It's one of those things that you get addicted to and keep growing, growing, growing if you have the space."
 As Tiverton resident Susan Medyn can attest, you don't have to own a farm to keep bees. At current count, she manages 16 hives -- nine in her 1-acre backyard a stone's throw from the Sakonnet River, and seven more at another property nearby.
 She speaks thoughtfully about her seven summers as an amateur beekeeper. Like the Garmans, her passion grew out of a self-imposed challenge.
 "In 2011, I was diagnosed with a nasty form of breast cancer," Medyn explains. "It involved a lot of treatment in chemo and radiation. Afterward, I thought I would do something that would really challenge me. I didn't feel like skydiving was my thing -- I didn't want a one-time thrill. Beekeeping was something that felt possible and, for me, something that felt intimidating."
 Tending to her buzzing flock quickly monopolized Medyn's free time -- not that she has a lot of it. She works as both a clinical social worker and a successful artist.
 She started out with just two hives, but even that proved daunting. "My first week was fraught with unusual experiences. It was really difficult to know what to do," she says. "I installed the bees, and they swarmed two days later. Not having equipment, I put them back in the hive. Of course, swarming means they need another hive, so they swarmed again. Within two more days, there was another swarm from the other hive. All my neighbors were thinking, 'What is she doing?'"
 Medyn and the Garmans aren't the only ones in Newport County feeling the buzz. Whether it's to tune out technology or get back to nature, more and more people are experimenting with backyard beehives.
 Newport resident and bee expert Ed Karle, who owns and runs a training, mentoring and onsite hive support service called Beeviews, says, "There has definitely been an increase in interest and in getting honeybees, across the country, in all states and towns. On average, there are four or more beekeepers of various scales in every town in the U.S. When I started teaching beekeeping in 2008, my bee class had 12 people. Now, the numbers are always over 100."
 When it comes to apiculture, Karle's reach is extensive, stretching into greater Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He teaches classes in beekeeping at Bristol Community College, where he's an adjunct professor, as well as through the Bee School offered by the Rhode Island Beekeepers Association (RIBA) at Rhode Island College.
 "It's very important to go to a beekeeping school offered by a state or county organization," Karle says. "The instructors are local, experienced beekeepers and their knowledge is critical to starting the hobby on a good foundation. Besides taking a formal beekeeping class, new beekeepers should also get a local mentor who can [provide] support."
 Jim Garman agrees that beginners should start to build a knowledge base before jumping in. "RIBA offers a really excellent class that happens in January or February," he says. "I would definitely not recommend just taking this up without even a modicum of learning."
 Adds Michelle, "In addition to taking the class, find some kind of mentor who has been doing this forever and has seen every issue they could possibly see. They can come out and walk you through what's going on with your hive. That's been an invaluable tool."
 Medyn says that by her fifth year with hives she felt like she had just reached kindergarten. "I moved forward, learning more and taking classes, learning more and going to conferences, learning more, reading, asking for help." She currently belongs to three organizations and frequents beekeeping meetings. She also still touches base with her mentor, who happens to be Karle.
 Although the initial time investment in learning can be steep, Karle says that beekeepers only spend about 20 hours total tending to their hives over the course of a full year, and bees are really only active March through December. "Honeybees do not love to see their beekeeper visit and do inspections. Beekeeping is not like a human-dog relationship. What beekeepers need to do is visit their hives for specific reasons or tasks at the right times of the year with the right tools."
 But if you ask Medyn, she'll tell you the experience can be a bit more intensive. "It's time-consuming and involved -- a tremendous amount of work," she says. "It involves trying to anticipate and assess what you're seeing, and to do the proper actions. It can take hours on a beautiful Saturday. But I just love to see what's going on in there."
 If you've got the time and energy to devote and would like to become an apiarist, expect to invest about $600 during the first season. That covers personal gear, a bee kit with bees, hive parts, and annual consumables like sugar and honey bottling supplies.
 One thing you don't necessarily need is a lot of space. To avoid getting stung -- or having your neighbors get stung -- you'll just want to locate your hive in an easy-to-get-to spot that's not in the way of doors, pathways or outdoor activities. You also need sunlight. "It wakes them up," explains Karle. "Bees use the sun to navigate to and from forage sources. The earlier the direct sun, the better."
 Newport County offers a pretty nice environment for beekeeping. "There's a lot of undeveloped land, which allows bees to have a variety of forage," Medyn says. "We're so fortunate that it's not monoculture crop-based or something where there's more challenges. The biggest challenge would be if a farmer or lawn care company didn't abide by appropriate use of pesticides."
 Because of this, honeybees in Newport County are pretty happy -- and happy honeybees don't hang around looking to dive bomb humans. Honeybees typically forage over a three-mile radius from the hive (about 25 square miles) looking for pollen, nectar and water.
 "If the bees are well managed, then they're usually pretty calm," Jim Garman says. "It's generally during the requeening process that you run into trouble."
 Adds Michelle, "The only other time you'd maybe see an aggressive hive would be at night, if raccoons or something else is bothering them, and the bees are super-defensive and alert."
 Keeping bees has not only been a wonderful experience for Medyn and the Garmans, but it has enriched other areas of their lives. For Medyn, it has inspired and informed her artwork in a few ways. "A lot of the work since I've had bees [depicts] bits of honeycomb and bees flying around," she says.
 Medyn also paints her actual hives, using a technique from her Polish heritage. It's the traditional Eastern European process of painting intricate designs on Easter eggs. "This enables me to have hives that are appealing to me," she says. "Also, bees prefer to have a way to identify their own hive. Bees will drift into other hives if, say, they're all white and in a line. They recognize the different colors and patterns on the hive that they should go to."
 Most local beekeepers harvest honey to give as gifts or eat themselves. Others with large hives, like the Garmans and Medyn, sell it. To try out their brands of Newport County honey, look for Medyn's at Coastal Roasters in Tiverton, and the Garmans' through The Green Grocer in Portsmouth, A Market on Bellevue in Newport, and the Jamestown Farmers Market.

That’s easier said than done when teachers are still adjusting to the challenges of teaching online, especially when the students don't know them -- and vice versa. How do you rethink a profession that hinges on personal engagement and variety to work solely through video calls and computer screens? In the time of coronavirus, teachers like Hansel are making it work with creativity, a dizzying array of new apps and software, and a lot of patience. And they’re learning a lot along the way.

But the main reason for the fungus-shaped hole in our cultural life, Sheldrake speculates, is a failure of imagination. “Fungi live much of their lives out of sight. What we see most of the time are mushrooms, and mushrooms are ephemeral – imagine if all you knew about an apple tree were the apples that showed up once a year. It’s harder to feel curiosity about them, and to satisfy that curiosity.”

Although these updates should make the 2014 Hyundai Veloster a bit more fun to drive than earlier versions, Hyundai's three-door coupe has some catching up to do in this department. Although both of the available engines are fuel- efficient, they're not especially potent, and the Veloster is significantly slower than most similarly priced rivals. Another issue is ride quality, as this coupe tends to ride harshly around town, while its lack of composure over bumps detracts from its handling abilities. Although the more aggressively tuned Turbo R-Spec model could prove to be more enjoyable on twisty back roads, buyers who commute on potholed roads will want to a take a thorough test-drive before committing to this version. Finally, from the standpoint of practicality, bear in mind that while this Hyundai is more versatile than most two-door hatchbacks, almost every four-door hatch on the market has it beat for maximum cargo space.

The neglect of the Sedona is especially critical in light of the redesigned minivans from Chrysler, Dodge, Honda and Toyota. In comparison, Kia gave its van a slight power bump and some minor styling tweaks last year. For 2012, the Sedona gets only a few different exterior colors and an optional rear-seat entertainment system for both trim levels. It's still an exceptional value, but the Sedona suddenly looks a little tired within its class and even within its own brand family.

ADRIAN -- Despite a number of businesses jockeying to carve out a space in the Adrian marijuana landscape, each is finding early success in recreational sales.
   
 On April 24, the first recreational marijuana sales were made at North Coast Provisions and Amazing Budz. In the coming weeks and months, four other shops joined them. Today, cannabis users have plenty of options to choose from with six dispensaries offering recreational products.
   
 "We thought COVID would initially impact sales," said Michael Dowdell, director of retail for Lume Cannabis Co., but, he said, the Adrian location has seen sales increase month after month.
   
 Lume, 738 S. Main St., opened selling medicinal marijuana products in February and launched recreational sales in May.
   
 Down the street is Adrian's newest marijuana retailer -- Heads Cannabis, 913 S. Main St. -- which opened in June. Manager Abe Aoun said once they started using Weedmaps, an online platform where customers can see product selection and place orders, sales took off.
   
 "We also have started to build up a loyal customer base despite all the established competition in the area," he said in an email. "Depending on the day of the week we can have 100 to 500 customers per day."
   
 Aoun said there have been lines, but the wait hasn't kept people away.
   
 "They all say the competitive price and the exceptional quality is well worth the wait," he said. "We are steadily growing as we build up a reputation for a great product at the most reasonable prices with the community."
   
 Dowdell said they've had a similar amount of foot traffic in their stores. Lume has 10 locations across the state including Big Rapids, Kalamazoo, Mackinaw City and Petoskey.
   
 North Coast owner and CEO Sean McQuarrie told The Daily Telegram they've seen a fivefold increase in business since they started recreational sales, averaging 200 customers per day.
   
 "It's gone really, really well, I think," he said. "Even during a pandemic, it has exceeded our expectations. It's been much busier than I thought it would."
   
 Flower is the top seller at shops that spoke to the Telegram for this story.
   
 McQuarrie said flower, or bud, accounts for 40% to 45% of North Coast's sales.
   
 Edibles are becoming increasingly popular, especially gummies.
   
 Co-owner of Highwire Farms Eric Kennedy said edibles offer an alternative to those who cannot or don't want to smoke marijuana. They're also more discreet.
   
 Dispensary-purchased edibles are easy to dose, which is another appealing factor, according to Kennedy. A common experience for many cannabis users is taking too much of a street-bought edible and having an intense high.
   
 Prepackaged edibles come with easy-to-follow directions on how to dose by milligrams.
   
 Pinning down just one reason why marijuana sales remain strong for nearly every business during a pandemic and struggling economy likely oversimplifies customer trends.
   
 McQuarrie said there are likely a few reasons.
   
 There's the novelty of it, finally being able to buy a product, in a store, legally, for the very first time.
   
 Not needing a medical card is another. McQuarrie said there are customers buying recreational marijuana because they didn't want to go through the process of getting a medical card or not wanting the stigmatization that comes with it, especially with job applications.
   
 "I think it's opened the doors for a lot of people," he said.
   
 And then there's quarantine. Similar to how liquor stores have done well, McQuarrie said some success can be attributed to people stuck at home with nothing to do.
   
 "I think part of it is people are bored at home," he said.
   
 Worth noting, these early successes came during a time when many shops were restricted to curbside and delivery only. McQuarrie said about 40% of North Coast's business is still curbside.
   
 As the local market becomes more saturated, businesses will need to find a way to set themselves apart from one another.
   
 For Highwire, it's building a brand of customer service. Kennedy said budtenders are instructed to be good listeners, hear out customers and be a "professional seller."
   
 "We hire based on a lot of factors and how they translate on the sales floor," he said. "I think our group is as good as anyone in the city, or the state for that matter."
   
 Having one of the more unique layouts can't hurt either. Highwire has an aesthetic the owners call industrial farm. Walls have a faux brick look, and the glossy countertops are made of maple and walnut wood.
   
 Highwire has also put a unique spin on reward programs.
   
 Discounts, deals and specials are common at a dispensary, but at Highwire customers can join Canna Co-op.
   
 For a monthly fee, customers can join Canna Co-op, which gives them access to exclusive products and discounts. Members also have access to monthly educational meetings. Topics range from how to use concentrates, the basics of terpenes -- the organic compounds that give strains their effects -- and how to dose edibles.
   
 Kennedy said the co-op also provides networking opportunities where people who grow their own products can learn from other growers.
   
 Lume has found success through its own branded products.
   
 Anyone in the industry will tell you product supply has yet to catch up to demand. With its own cultivation site in Evart in northern Michigan, Lume has reduced supply concerns by always having its own stock on hand.
   
 Dowdell said Lume stores are always in stock and their own products have been some of their best sellers. Lume products are marketed based on their effects. Effects include "dream," "focus," "move" and "recover."
   
 Dowdell said these have been popular among customers as they can find what they are looking for.
   
 Prices are expected to drop once supply catches up to demand. At that point, it'll be a race to the bottom and then the industry will rebound, according to Kennedy.
   
 "There are going to be people who fall off," he said.
   
 Amazing Budz did not respond to questions by end of the day Friday. Gage Cannabis Co. did not respond to an initial inquiry.

Those rivals are well-established, starting with the 2015 Honda Odyssey, which wins in fuel economy and road handling, but carries a steeper price. The refreshed 2015 Toyota Sienna runs neck and neck with the Odyssey in most respects, but the Sedona is again likely to be the better value. Although the 2015 Chrysler Town & Country's Stow 'n Go seats are the slickest in the business, the van's overall interior quality pales in comparison to the Kia's. Dark-horse candidates include the Nissan Quest (if cargo space isn't a high priority) and the 2015 Mazda 5 (if a smaller minivan would serve you better).
