 Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!
 Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.
 Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.
 Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.
 You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.
 You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.
 If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

Adobe hopes that allowing for easier access to its apps will help keep K-12 and college students on track despite the lack of access to on-campus computer labs. IT admins have to fill out a form, which Adobe will evaluate. The admins can then grant access by uploading spreadsheets of approved users to their Creative Cloud management app.
 This is probably a good move on Adobe's part, especially in light of its strange decision to revoke licenses to old versions of its applications last year. Students can continue to practice their creative skills while cooped up at home, and messing around in Photoshop and Illustrator outside of academic pursuits could help kill some boredom, too.

 – Treats bars and restaurants are the same. Bars will be able to have carryout sales of alcohol and food, if allowed by local ordinances and state law. This will help ensure thousands of establishments can stay in business during this unprecedented health emergency.

Prior to the town meeting vote on the proposed school project, I wrote to this page under the above caption. At that time, the board had a guesstimate of $55,000,000 to do infrastructure upgrades. I had encouraged them to fine tune that number and put that option on the ballot for the voter’s consideration. We know how that turned out.
 The board presumably has a list of the deficiencies of the buildings provided by their professional planners. Here is a proposal which I believe would gain favor with the voters.
 The board should consider prioritizing those projects, keeping in mind, of course, safety and compliance issues, and complete them over a number, perhaps, three to five years?

The Patriots run game suffered last season when the team lost fullback James Develin and his backup, Jakob Johnson, to injury. It looks like the Patriots are being proactive this offseason to provide even more depth to the fullback position.
   
 According toa source, veteran fullback Dan Vitale has agreed to a contract with the Patriots. Vitale, 26, spent the past two seasons in Green Bay and the previous two in Cleveland. Last season, was Vitale's most productive in the NFL. He caught a career-high seven passes for 97 receiving yards.
   
 Last summer, Vitale made a good impression on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who said, "In a non-disrespectful way, he has surprised all of us with his athleticism. Kinda look at him sometimes, you think meathead, weight room guy, but you realize he can run, he can catch, he can read coverages. He's been very impressive."
   
 The Patriots had interest in Vitale prior to the 2016 NFL Draft. They met with the fullback at the NFL Combine and Nick Caserio also went to Vitale's Northwestern Pro Day. Vitale was eventually drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round. He started his career on the Bucs practice squad before signing with the Browns active roster. After being released in 2018, Vitale signed with the Packers practice squad. He ended up appearing five games with Green Bay that season.
   
 By signing Vitale, it could be a sign that the Patriots are worried about the health of Develin. Last season, the 31-year-old's year ended due to a neck injury. Develin, a 2017 Pro Bowler, played a big role in the Patriots run game. Perhaps, Vitale will next season.

Los turistas esperan ser atendidos por los programas de repatriación lanzados por sus propios Gobiernos, como el de Argentina, que autorizó 100 vuelos para repatriar ciudadanos que quedaron varados en el exterior.
 "Estamos aquí desde ayer. La noche la pasamos tirados en el piso. Teníamos vuelo para la próxima semana con Gol, pero Gol canceló todos los vuelos y no nos da respuesta y dice que el problema es de nuestro país que no los deja ingresar, pero el consulado dice que eso no es verdad y que el problema es que Gol no quiere llevarnos porque económicamente no les debe rendir", denunció a Efe la argentina Estefania Lanzilota.
 La turista aseguró que unos 400 argentinos fueron dejados en Río por Gol y que Aerolíneas Argentinas, que continúa operando, le está dando prioridad a los pasajeros que tienen pasaje con esa empresa.

There has been no decision made yet on what will happen with Little League All-Stars this season but the two expect that to be addressed in an upcoming meeting with the local Little League presidents.
 “Normally we have to stop in mid-June for All-Stars but there’s a possibility that they may extend the season longer into the summer so the kids will be able to play the whole season, it’ll just be pushed back some,” Allen said.
 “The later they push it, because we have the regular Little League season and then all our local leagues around here participate in All-Stars and normally the All-Stars starts around the third week of June, so obviously the further they push it back, the more it will effect that,” Floyd.
 Both leagues are still accepting registrations. Floyd and Allen are urging parents to register their children for the upcoming season as soon as possible to help the leagues to begin preparing for the season.
 “We’re still taking registrations and are encouraging kids to register because when the time comes, we want to be able to get started,” Floyd said. “The more that go ahead and get registered, the more ready we will be once we get the all clear. There’s a lot of behind the scenes things that takes place. It allows us to be better prepared for when the decision has been made that we can play.”

The largest oil supply surplus the world has ever seen in a single quarter is about to hit the global market from April, creating an imbalance of around 10 million barrels per day (bpd). An exclusive Rystad Energy analysis shows global storage infrastructure is in trouble and will be unable to take more crude and products in just a few months.
 Our current liquid balances show supply surpassing oil demand by an average of nearly 6 million bpd in 2020, resulting in an accumulated implied storage build of 2.0 billion barrels this year.
 Based on our rigorous analysis, we find that the world currently has around 7.2 billion barrels crude and products in storage, including 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion barrels currently onboard oil tankers at sea. We estimate that, on average, 76% of the world's oil storage capacity is already full.
 There is essentially no idle storage capacity available on tankers, as Saudi Arabia and other producers might have already wiped out the available population of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) for March and April 2020.

Britains finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would help to pay wages of companies in an unprecedented step as it unveiled a programme of support for working, self-employed and unemployed people, as well as businesses. Below are details of the policies Sunak announced.GOVERNMENT- PAID WAGES Sunak said the government would step in and help to pay peoples wages for the first time ever, as part of a new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, for which every employer in the country will be eligible.Employers will be able to contact HMRC revenue and customs for a grant to cover most of the wages of people who are not working that are furloughed and kept on payroll rather than being laid off, Sunak said. Government grants would cover 80 of the salary of retained workers to a total of 2,500 pounds a month.That means workers ... can retain their job, even if their employer cannot afford to pay them. The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to March 1 and will initially be open for three months, though Sunak said he may extend it if needed.I am placing no limit on the amount of funding available for the scheme, he said. BUSINESS LOAN SCHEMESunak said the previously announced coronavirus business interruption loan scheme would now be interest-free for 12 months, rather than the 6 months announced initially. The loans would be available from Monday. He said he would announce more steps next week so larger and medium sized firms could access credit they need.TAX HOLIDAY FOR BUSINESSES Sunak said he would defer the next quarter of VAT payments for businesses.That means no business will pay any VAT from now until the end of June and youll have until the end of the financial year to repay those bills, he said. That is a direct injection of over 30 billion pounds of cash to businesses, equivalent to 1.5 of GDP.BENEFITS AND SELF-EMPLOYED Acknowledging that it would not be possible to avoid job losses, Sunak said Britain would raise its main state-paid benefit.He said the universal credit standard allowance for the next 12 months would increase by 1,000 pounds a year, with the working tax credit basic element rising by the same amount as well. Together the measures will benefit over 4 million of our most vulnerable households, he said.Sunak added that Britain would also suspend the minimum income floor for self-employed people affected by the economic impact of coronavirus, meaning that they could access universal credit at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay for workers. Taken together, Im announcing nearly 7 billion pounds of extra support through the welfare system, he said.In addition, Sunak said that the next self-assessment payments for self- employed workers would be deferred until January 2021. RENTINGSunak said that he would support renters after previously announcing support for homeowners via a mortgage holiday. Im announcing today nearly 1 billion pounds of support for renters by increasing the generosity of housing benefit and universal credit so that the local housing allowance will cover at least 30 of market rents in your area, he said.

The President of the Italian Players’ Union (AIC) believes it would be nonsensical and dangerous for soccer teams to resume training next week as Italy battles with a devastating coronavirus outbreak. All sport has been suspended since March 9 and a nationwide lockdown enforced, as the country attempts to stem the spread of a virus that has now killed 4,032 people, more than any other nation.
 However, Serie A club Cagliari said on Wednesday that their first team would return to training in small groups on Monday, March 23, while media reports in Italy say that Lazio and Napoli intend to follow suit. “Anyone who is thinking about gaining an advantage by training their players, I don’t know what they have in their minds,” Damiano Tommasi wrote on the AIC website.
 “I say this without wanting to cause controversy, because this is not the moment to for it. “But training now, two months before the championship resumes, doesn’t make sense. It’s also dangerous.”

 While Amazon has taken a number of steps in recent days to protect workers -- including discontinuing stand-up meetings where workers gathered en masse and allowing workers to take unlimited unpaid days off -- several warehouse employees and industry experts told CNN Business they feel the company should be doing more to shield those at the core of its business who can't do their jobs from home.
 Warehouse workers are petitioning the company to provide paid sick leave regardless of whether someone tests positive for coronavirus, given how difficult it can be to get access to a test. They're asking for facilities to be shut down and for workers to be tested for coronavirus when a positive case is found. In interviews, some raised concerns about pressure to work longer hours, lack of worker screening for possible symptoms, and adequate social distancing measures.

ETC/USD 30-minute chart Ethereum Classic has had a very choppy session on Friday. at 8am London time the price hit a high of 5.53 but could not keep hold of the gains above 5.50. Then the sellers came in and dragged the price down to 4.42 at 8.30pm London time. Since then the buyers have brought the price back up above the black trendline but once again 5.00 was a step too far. The MACD histogram is below the zero line, along with the signal lines. The price is also under themoving average (55 SMA) which is another bearish sign. Interestingly, something about the chart still looks bullish.

Johnson might not have seen Ervin in action for Freedom — or for UNC Greensboro, where he signed after his FHS days were over — but he still saw him play up close and personal on more than one occasion in the driveway.
 “He tossed me around, he busted my lip one time. We were competitive,” Johnson said. “It was either win against him or run hills up and down. I loved it, I love getting down and dirty, that’s just how I am.
 “The first time I really did beat him, I was 13 and he got mad. He stood outside and shot the basketball until about 12 o’clock that night. I was happy I actually got a win. The next day, I came home from school and he beat me.”
 Johnson said one of his dad’s favorite basketball memories came from a dunk contest he won in high school.
 “He went to a dunk contest at Virginia Tech and was the shortest person there,” Johnson said. “Everybody doubted him, they didn’t think he was going to do a lot. They said he went baseline and caught a windmill dunk and everybody went wild. I wish I would have seen that. He had a tape of it, but it got lost.
 “He used to dunk on people taller than him. Everybody talks about how athletic he was and how he was the No. 2 player in the state and how good he was. I get compared to him because of how athletic I am. But I don’t think I compare to that. I don’t know.”
 Johnson, who like Ervin stands around 5-foot-11, enjoyed a special moment earlier this season when he threw down his first dunk in game action when Freedom won at rival McDowell.

The number of coronavirus cases recorded in Belgium surged past 2,000 on Friday and the number of deaths attributed to the disease COVID-19 jumped up by 16 to 37. According to the country's national crisis centre, 462 new confirmed cases of the virus have been reported, bringing the total to 2,257 in a country of 11.4 million people.
 Two-thirds of the new cases overnight were in Dutch-speaking Flanders, in northern Belgium. Emmanuel Andre, a spokesman for the crisis centre, said Belgium was better prepared than Italy had been when it became the focus of the European outbreak, but that hospitals would need more space for the most serious cases.
 In the past 24 hours another 203 people have been admitted to hospital in Belgium, and 164 of them will require intensive care, such as breathing assistance. "The average age of those hospitalised is around 60," he said. "In Belgium we have 1,900 beds equipped with ventilators, and places are being set up today to increase this number." "We are expecting demand to increase in the coming days," Andre warned.
 Europe is now the epicentre of the pandemic that emerged in China in December, with Italy now the hardest country. Belgium is now one of several European countries to order a national lockdown, although one less sternly enforced than in neighbouring France \-- and with more exceptions.
 Already, bars and restaurants are shut and many people have been asked to work from home and to avoid socialising and crowds, but officials expect the measures to tighten. "Everyone should respect these measures, and in my opinion, exceptions to the rules will come to an end in the coming days," another crisis centre spokesman Benoit Ramacker said.

Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak said the government would help to pay wages of companies in an unprecedented step as it unveiled a programme of support for working, self-employed and unemployed people, as well as businesses. Below are details of the policies Sunak announced.
 GOVERNMENT-PAID WAGES Sunak said the government would step in and help to pay people's wages for the first time ever, as part of a new Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, for which every employer in the country will be eligible.
 "Employers will be able to contact HMRC (revenue and customs) for a grant to cover most of the wages of people who are not working that are furloughed and kept on payroll rather than being laid off," Sunak said. Government grants would cover 80% of the salary of retained workers to a total of 2,500 pounds a month.
 "That means workers ... can retain their job, even if their employer cannot afford to pay them." The scheme will cover the cost of wages backdated to March 1 and will initially be open for three months, though Sunak said he may extend it if needed.
 "I am placing no limit on the amount of funding available for the scheme," he said. BUSINESS LOAN SCHEME
 Sunak said the previously announced coronavirus business interruption loan scheme would now be interest-free for 12 months, rather than the 6 months announced initially. The loans would be available from Monday. He said he would announce more steps next week so larger and medium sized firms could access credit they need.
 TAX HOLIDAY FOR BUSINESSES Sunak said he would defer the next quarter of VAT payments for businesses.
 "That means no business will pay any VAT from now until the end of June and you'll have until the end of the financial year to repay those bills," he said. "That is a direct injection of over 30 billion pounds of cash to businesses, equivalent to 1.5% of GDP."
 BENEFITS AND SELF-EMPLOYED Acknowledging that it would not be possible to avoid job losses, Sunak said Britain would raise its main state-paid benefit.
 He said the universal credit standard allowance for the next 12 months would increase by 1,000 pounds a year, with the working tax credit basic element rising by the same amount as well. "Together the measures will benefit over 4 million of our most vulnerable households," he said.
 Sunak added that Britain would also suspend the minimum income floor for self- employed people affected by the economic impact of coronavirus, meaning that they could access universal credit at a rate equivalent to statutory sick pay for workers. "Taken together, I'm announcing nearly 7 billion pounds of extra support through the welfare system," he said.
 In addition, Sunak said that the next self-assessment payments for self- employed workers would be deferred until January 2021. RENTING
 Sunak said that he would support renters after previously announcing support for homeowners via a mortgage holiday. "I'm announcing today nearly 1 billion pounds of support for renters by increasing the generosity of housing benefit and universal credit so that the local housing allowance will cover at least 30% of market rents in your area," he said.

Women protesters in Shaheen Bagh on Friday said they will continue their sit- in against the amended citizenship law on Sunday.
 Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to remain indoors on March 22 as part of a ‘people’s curfew’ to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The women have been blocking a side of a road connecting south-east Delhi to Noida since mid- December to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
 On Monday, the Delhi government had banned the gathering of over 50 people in light of the outbreak, the size of the gatherings has since been reduce to 20 people. “It also applies to Shaheen Bagh,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said.
 On Friday, the protesters said that not more than 50 women were sitting on the site at any given time.
 “On Sunday, we will sit under small tents. Only two women will sit under each tent and maintain a distance of one metre between them,” a protester said.
 Another protester, Rizvana, said the women had been taking every precaution and they were covered in burqa all the time. “Washing hands regularly is part of our lifestyle. We offer namaz five times a day and we wash our hands every time,” she added.
 Ritu Kushik, another protester, said women aged above 70 and children less than 10 years old were not being allowed at the protest site.
 “The women are not sitting on mattresses any more. Cots have been brought in and there is a minimum distance of three metres between every two cots. No more than two women can sit on one cot,” he said.

Of the major war or proxy war zones that we have been covering here, Libya remains in its usual state of stalemated civil war, but that's also because COVID-19 has not yet taken hold in the country.

 \- Canada's oil industry has been hit particularly hard by the virus, bringing WCS down to less than $6 per barrel on Thursday before regaining some lost ground to hover at around $13 - still hardly enough for anyone to profit. As one might expect, Canadian oil companies are cutting their capital spend for the year to the tune of billions of dollars. Canadian Natural Resources is cutting its CAPEX by more than C$1 billion, Crescent Point is cutting between C$700 million to $800 million, Enerplus is cutting 40% off its spend or C$325 million, and Husky Energy is cutting C$1 billion, to name a few.
 \- To assist its oil industry, Canada is thought to be preparing in secret a package to distribute aid to its oil industry. The package could be worth $10 billion and may roll out as early as next week.

The U.S. unemployment benefits program, a key part of the safety net for the labor market, is facing its biggest test in more than a decade. More than 2 million applications could be filed this week, economists said, as people who work for restaurants, bars, hotels, and other businesses suddenly find themselves out of work because of the coronavirus.States that cut unemployment staff and benefits during better economic times may be unprepared for the deluge in applications, analysts say. Some are moving rapidly to hire new workers or reallocate staff to keep up with the demand. States are just not in a position to respond to this, said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project in Washington, D.C. Theyre at historically low levels of funding and theyre moving into a state where there may be historically high levels of claims within a couple of weeks.The pandemic is dealing a blow to states already facing budget shortfalls. Twenty-three states were short on unemployment insurance trust funds as of last year, before the coronavirus shock, a Department of Labor calculation shows httpsoui.doleta.govunemploylargecarousel.aspslide4. Some workers who applied for the program this week were met with downed websites, long waits on phone lines and other delays.After being laid off from her job as a bartender in New York City, Caitlin Ma, 29, went online to apply for unemployment and food stamps on Thursday. But the systems are so bogged down, she said. To expedite her food stamp application, Ma will have to go physically to the offices, despite health officials recommendations. Logins for the New York State Department of Labor are up 400 from the typical traffic and claims are up by more than 1000 in some areas this week, said Deanna Cohen, a spokeswoman for the department. The state is dedicating more than 700 staff members to deal with the increase, Cohen said.Making things worse, qualifications and benefits available may also vary based on where workers live. The U.S. Department of Labor, which sets federal guidelines for the program, recently gave states the flexibility to provide benefits to people temporarily out of work. But states administer the benefits, and not all have made the change.California made unemployment benefits available to people who had their hours cut because of the virus. New York waived the one-week waiting period for benefits for people who are out of work because of closures or quarantines related to the coronavirus. And Massachusetts is providing more leeway for people who are currently receiving benefits but miss a deadline because of the virus. North Carolina, where filings have already jumped, this week said httpsfiles.nc.govgovernordocumentsfilesEO118.pdf that anyone separated from employment by the virus, including having their hours reduced though still retaining a job, is entitled to unemployment insurance.But lawmakers in Mississippi did not agree on a bill to extend access to jobless benefits and are now on recess until April 1, according to a report in Mississippi Today. httpsmississippitoday.org20200317coronavirus-in- mississippi-legislature-to-suspend-session-works-to-ensure-protections-for- local-government-workers Ten states, including Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia, have cut their maximum length of benefits over the last several years to be less than 26 weeks, which is the standard for most states.A bill passed by the Senate this week could increase funding for state labor departments and would make extended benefits available in the states where the unemployment rate rises by at least 10. That funding could provide needed support to states that are now hiring rapidly to rebuild their staffs, Evermore said. Some hospitality workers in Miami said they were told that after submitting applications for unemployment benefits online that it would take up to 72 hours to be notified that everything is in order. Others said they expected to be waiting a week or more.On Friday, a message on the website for the states labor department said the department is experiencing higher than average wait times. Theres nothing to do other than wait, said Bri Thomas, 25, who was an events manager for a handful of hotel restaurants in Miami.Florida is planning to hire more than 100 staffers to help process claims, and starting next week, its call center will be open seven days a week, said Tiffany Vause, a spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. Broader access to unemployment benefits can help stabilize the economy after a downturn - and speed up the recovery - by providing people who lose their jobs with cash they can use to buy groceries, gas, and other necessities. The changes some states are making may help lessen the blow to their local economies.Its unfortunate that it takes a crisis for us to realize how important it is for people to have good unemployment insurance programs, said Dave Cooper, a senior economic analyst for the Economic Policy Institute in Washington D.C. Still, the recent adjustments may not fully close the gaps in the system. Self-employed people and contract workers who experience a drop off in business because of the virus may not be able to qualify for help, said Stephen Wandner, a research fellow at the W.E. Upjohn Institute.There are all of these other people who are losing their jobs who are not covered by unemployment insurance in the first place, said Wandner.

Cyclists deprived of their weekend ride out with friends and fitness fanatics who cant get to the gym are turning to online cycling workouts to help them stay in shape during the coronavirus shutdown.With professional racing closed down in Europe and club cyclists being advised against riding in large groups, the Zwift indoor training platform has seen a manic few weeks, according to spokesman Chris Snook. Some of the best-known riders in professional road cycling have been making the most of the their unexpected spare time to lead out virtual rides on Zwifts fictionalised Watopia course as amateurs join in from their home-based exercise bikes.Its providing a unique opportunity for cycling fans to not only ride alongside their heroes, but to ask questions, Snook told Reuters. Guests have included 2018 Tour de France champion Geraint Thomas, German rider Andre Greipel, world champion Annemiek van Vleuten and many more.Others who might normally prefer to head to the gym have decided its time to buy a Peloton exercise bike rather than risk going to group classes. It seemed like a good opportunity for me to make an investment so I could exercise inside of my house, enjoy that exercise, and save money in the long term, said Amanda Clare from San Francisco.Clare, 41, normally works out at Barrys Bootcamp but decided to drop that as the spread of the coronavirus forced people to retreat to home. I spend about 500 a month on Barrys, so while the Peloton was an investment it was 2,450 that will be made up if I just move to working out on my Peloton, she added.Clare is crossing her fingers that the bike will be delivered as planned next week despite the disruption. Jenn McCarron, 40, from Los Angeles has also decided to trade up by getting a Peloton bike after subscribing to its online classes for eight months.What made me pull the trigger was quarantine and loss of control over my fitness routine, which 100 takes place outside of my apartment, said McCarron. When the quarantine started happening last Friday, I started getting this low-level burn of urgency, like wow, if we go in for two months I need that level of cardio, and not just that - the community and the connectivity around it, she added.Criminal defence lawyer Liza Rosado, 35, in San Juan, Puerto Rico is waiting for a Peloton bike that she ordered in the middle of last month. Now that Im gonna be stuck at home, I really wish I had it here, she told Reuters.Still, Rosado is keeping things in perspective in light of the pandemic, which has led to a curfew across Puerto Rico and shuttered all nonessential businesses. Im not going to be angry or mad about it people are losing their jobs, she says, adding, my clients are in jail. We dont know whats going to happen. We know they are one of the populations thats most at risk from Covid-19.Back in Britain, the British Cycling Race Series, starting this week, features eight 30-minute races in which amateurs and elite riders, often those self-isolating, can compete against each other from the safety of their own living room. Were in an entirely unique situation that means therell be no racing for a while, but its important that we try to find some sense of normality in all this, said British Cyclings womens endurance coach Emma Trott.

Manager Anthony Price closed the doors of the Bedford pub in Tunbridge Wells at 20:00 GMT. Staff took over £500 in their last hour and were forced to turn away dozens of people shortly before closing, he said.
 The owners had considered closing earlier in the week, but had waited to receive the government order to close "because we didn't know whether the insurance companies would cover us".
 "It was pay day for the staff today, so we wanted to make sure they got paid and made sure they were going to be alright for at least a month," he said.
 Mr Price expects the pub to be closed for 12 weeks, but said it was "all up in the air".
 Forcing pubs to close was the wrong decision, he said.
 "I think the public are very resilient, especially the British, we are known for our stiff upper lip. I think, let the public decide what they want to do.
 "If the older generation, the younger generation, they want to go to bars and restaurants, let them. At least give them the option.
 "By me working, that's down to me, that's my risk. If the older generation want to come in for a beer, that's at their risk.
 "I understand why they've done it and hopefully it brings a quicker resolution to the end of the virus, but I just think let people do what they want to do. It's locking people up for a minimum of 12 weeks, it is like prison.

But when former LSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda was named Baylor’s head coach in January, Munoz readily accepted his offer to become the Bears’ wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator.
 It’s a new challenge and more responsibility, and Munoz can’t wait to dive deeper into his job.
 “That was a good situation being over there (at LSU) as far as the talent you’re going to see on a day-to-day basis,” Munoz said. “But I’ve been really excited about the talent here. As far as the receiver room is concerned, it sounds like we have some guys that can go make some plays for us. So I don’t think we’re starting from scratch over here.”
 Though the Bears lost all-Big 12 receiver Denzel Mims and sixth-year senior Chris Platt, there’s still a lot of talent on board with Tyquan Thornton, R.J. Sneed, Josh Fleeks and Jared Atkinson returning. Thornton is poised to become Baylor’s top go-to threat after making 45 catches for 782 yards and five touchdowns in Baylor’s 11-3 season.
 Additionally, redshirt freshmen Yusuf Terry, Jaylen Ellis and Kolby White and sophomore Jackson Gleeson are promising young receivers that senior quarterback Charlie Brewer and Gerry Bohanon and Jacob Zeno have in their arsenal.
 “They’re talented, they’re good, they’re fast,” Munoz said. “But I think more importantly right now what I’ve been most impressed about is they’re just good kids. They’re all doing the right stuff. They’re locked in, they’re focused. It’s been kind of refreshing from that standpoint, really fun to be around.”
 Munoz has coached college football for two decades after becoming an NAIA All- America quarterback at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kan., in the late 1990s.
 He spent three seasons as wide receivers coach and offensive coordinator at Eastern Illinois from 2005-07 before spending the next 10 seasons at Louisiana (Lafayette) where he served in multiple roles.

While most of everything else continues to close down due to the coronavirus pandemic, golf courses are still maintaining -- though precautions continue to ramp up at both public and private courses.
 Playing golf in small groups stretched out over acres of land would seem to be the safest way to practice social distancing while still enjoying a sport, but within that activity there are still plenty of things to consider.
 "I keep reading stuff about how golf courses are the safest place to be," said Jimmy Harrison, club pro at Sleepy Hollow Golf Club in Hurricane, West Virginia. "I don't know how true that is when you think about employees, and there are a lot of things people don't think about. Touching steering wheels on golf carts, touching the flag stick on every hole, sticking your hand in the holes -- it may not be as safe as everyone thinks it is."
 To combat those concerns, courses have taken action.
 Sleepy Hollow, along with Berry Hills Country Club in Charleston, have started raising cups out of the ground in an effort to prevent golfers from having to reach in the hole to get their ball. Any putt that makes contact with the raised cup is counted as in.
 Edgewood Country Club in Sissonville, meanwhile, has devised its own system. Cut pool noodles are placed inside the cup, leaving about a half inch of space from the lip of the hole. That allows balls to settle in, but not drop to the bottom, meaning golfers can easily retrieve their balls without having to reach in the hole itself.
 While other courses have stayed open through the spread of the coronavirus, Edgewood closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Club pro Craig Berner said extensive efforts were done over that two-day period to make sure the facility was as clean as possible.
 "We kind of cleaned the facility out, took some extra precautions and locked some stuff up," Berner said. "We've put out more hand sanitizer. We went through the whole building and scrubbed everything down with Comet and Lysol."

What Im worried about in my head, Im only showing about 20 percent of it, he said. Psychologists and psychiatrists are beginning to report signs of distress among patients worried about the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic that has infected more than 14,500 nationwide, and over 255,000 globally, killing more than 10,000.Six clinicians interviewed by Reuters say the coronavirus has been the prime focus of virtually all recent therapy sessions. Stress caused by fear of the disease is compounded by isolation, mental health experts say, as governments close schools and restaurants, and recommend that people limit social interaction.Stress-reducing activities like exercise, watching sports and going to movies, are becoming nearly impossible after shutdowns of gyms, professional leagues and theaters. A BEAR WE CANT SEEThe virus invisibility makes it all the harder to reconcile the severity of the response. Were all a little disoriented, said Sharon Greenfield, a clinical psychologist in Concord, Massachusetts.When we see a bear, we go straight into fight-or-flight, but this is a bear we cant see or taste. Our brains arent quite sure whether were being exposed to a traumatic trigger or not. A ReutersIpsos poll this week showed 48 of Americans feel the pandemic is an imminent threat to the United States, up 20 percentage points from previous polling taken March 2-3.Psychiatrists interviewed by Reuters cited surges in requests for new anti-anxiety prescriptions and longer refills on existing ones. For mental health professionals, there is the challenge of providing much-needed care while following social distancing guidelines. That likely means seeing patients via video services.But remote therapy, known as telehealth, isnt covered by every insurance plan. Federal legislation enacted this month in response to the coronavirus eases restrictions on telehealth coverage under Medicare. Some states are also requiring private insurers to cover telehealth more broadly. Most therapists, though, have not historically provided it. A 2018 study published in the American Psychological Association APA Journal showed nearly 60 of providers do no online counseling, and just 6 do more than five hours per week.Since the outbreak took hold, people are scrambling to figure out how to do telehealth, said psychologist Lynn Bufka, director of practice research and policy at the APA. Greenfield said the mental health impact of the coronavirus should warrant a coordinated response, and that federal and local leader should have protocols for managing a mental health emergency as they do a physical one.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had no comment when asked if coordinated plans exist. The mental health of hospitals and other healthcare workers, who risk increased exposure to the virus, is a rising concern.The Facebook group Covid19 for Healthcare Workers, which had 124,000 members as of Friday, circulated online signup sheets for therapists willing to donate a free hour of care to such workers. Volunteers may be asked to provide some debriefing support, for the healthcare workers mental health needs during Covid-19, the form said. Administrators for the group did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.COPING TOOLS To manage anxiety, doctors recommend limiting news intake to once or twice a day, to stay abreast of health experts recommendations while avoiding over-exposure that can trigger panic.They suggest watching comforting movies, video-chatting with family, and going outside as long as it does not conflict with health experts guidance. Connect more deeply with nature, since that is a safe space many of us have become too busy to enjoy, said Charles Mobayed, a psychologist in Lunenburg, Massachusetts.They also recommend acknowledging anxious thoughts, rather than repressing them - but then moving on quickly. Notice yourself starting to go there, and say, I hear you, but Im not gonna think about that right now, said Laura Dalheim, a psychiatrist in New York City, which has seen a big spike in coronavirus cases with increased testing.Therapists who spend hours each day soothing the fears of others say they are not immune to the anxiety all around them. Dalheim says shes had to fight the urge to mirror her patients concerns during sessions. Greenfield, after an exhausting week, said she found herself on her couch last Friday night eating cheese puffs - and in bed by 930.Its common for health workers to exhaust themselves in a crisis, and crucial they heed the same stress-management advice they provide, said psychologist Jacqueline Sperling, an instructor at Harvard Medical School. If you wear down your resources, she said, you have only an empty hand to give..

There are various providers that give you the option to reduce or expend your Sim only contract. This can come in handy when you have too many or too little texts/minutes/data at the end of each month. Many Sim only deals are a part of a rolling contract, which means that the allowance you pay will over each month until you cancel it manually. Providers want you to stick to their company and retain business with you, so if you cancel your Sim only contract there is a big chance that they will reach out and try to convince you to stay. So it’s likely that they will give you extra benefits then.

I have a special affinity for underdogs. Maybe that’s because I have been one myself. So my interest was piqued when I heard that a political novice from Baxley (pop. 4,400) by the name of Dr. Kandiss Taylor is running for the United States Senate seat vacated by Johnny Isakson.
 Taylor, who has a Ph.D. in counselor education and supervision from Regent University in Virginia, is student services coordinator for the Appling County Board of Education and a former third grade teacher. She is married to an educator and is the mother of three children.
 Giving that she will be competing with Gov. Brian Kemp’s appointee, gazillionaire Kelly Loeffler, as well as Georgia Congressman Doug Collins, Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson, the Rev. Ralph Warnock, pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church; Ed Lieberman, son of former U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, and former federal prosecutor Ed Tarver, among others, I would say Dr. Kandiss Taylor definitely qualifies as an underdog.
 So, why is she doing it? “I have always had a great interest in government,” she said, “I thought about maybe running for a state office, but I could not afford to do that because I have to work full time.” Georgia legislators earn just a tad over $17,000 annually, not counting free meals from lizard-loafered lobbyists.
 Dr. Taylor said a seminal moment occurred when Dr. Ben Carson, a one-time presidential candidate and currently Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Trump Administration, spoke at Regent University. “He urged us to get involved, not to sit around and take for granted that someone else will do the job for us,” she remembers. “To me, it was like a calling.”
 This past summer, she found herself in Washington with her family. While at the Capitol, she turned to her husband, Ryan, and said, “I want to be a U.S. senator.” His advice? “Do it.” Thus, when word came that senior Sen. Johnny Isakson was retiring for health reasons, a campaign was born.
 “I looked at the major candidates,” she says. “Gov. Kemp’s appointee, Kelly Loeffler, is from Illinois, not Georgia, and owns the stock exchange. She is not one of us.” (Actually, it is her husband who owns it, but you get her point.)
 As for Doug Collins, Taylor says, “He is from Gainesville and a lot of powerful politicians come from there. I am a South Georgia girl. I represent the average Georgian. I am not wealthy. I live on a budget. I pay taxes and don’t look for loopholes. Most of all, there are not a lot of young working- class Republicans running for office. I want to change that.”
 Dr. Taylor is having difficulty finding out who the real enemy is. “I have voted Republican all my life,” she says, “and, yet, I am not a part of the ‘establishment.’ I am an outsider. I find it hard to get my calls returned and questions answered by the powers-that-be. “When I was in Atlanta qualifying for the race, Fox5 TV showed interest in talking to me about the idea of an outsider running for the Senate but then they suddenly backed out.” She wonders if someone got to the station and put the kibosh on the interview.
 As with everything on earth these days, the coronavirus has had an impact on campaigning. “I am using social media at this point,” she says, “and plan to be able to get around the state later and meet my fellow Georgians. They will see then who I am.” She hopes to gain the support of her fellow educators around the state. “I can’t think of anyone better than a middle-class educator raised in Georgia to represent our state,” she asserts.
 Her campaign platform is true-red Republican: Pro 2nd Amendment (“I have my pistol with me at all times, unless I am at school.”) Pro-Trump. Pro-life and a major emphasis on helping Georgia’s farmers. “Georgia’s farmers don’t want bailouts. They want to be paid a fair price for their commodity. Cotton prices are so low, the farmers can barely afford to grow it. Seed prices are significantly higher than in other states.” When I reminded her that Secretary of Agriculture George E. Perdue is a Georgian, she shot back, “And what has he done for our farmers?” Good question.
 I didn’t have the heart to tell her just how long her long-shot chances are. But Kandiss Taylor wouldn’t believe me, anyway. This is one underdog eager to race the political thoroughbreds.

Across the board, the cleaning of carts has become a top priority both before and after use. Also, restaurants/bars located in the facilities have either closed or been limited to takeout only.
 Efforts are also being made to keep crowds down inside clubhouses. Sleepy Hollow has shut down its practice facilities and its indoor simulator while Edgewood's driving range and chipping area weren't scheduled to open until March 31.
 The situation is obviously a fluid one and each course is looking to others in terms of future guidelines to follow. Harrison said the board at Sleepy Hollow is meeting this weekend to hash out plans.
 "We're taking it day by day," Harrison said. "We've started talking about going to just one person per cart and that's something I think you'll start to see happen. Our bag guys are constantly cleaning door handles, seats and steering wheels and we're talking about members not having bag service anymore at all."
 Despite the adjustments, business has seemed to be largely unaffected by the virus, although rainy weather during the week has limited play somewhat. The safe bet seems to point at golf continuing to be a viable option as long as it remains the only show in town.

"Quien corta el jamon en tu casa?" asked the butcher, his breath smelling of wine. "Who cuts the ham in your house?"   "Yo," I said, raising my hand. "Venga, entonces" he beckoned. "Come here, then."      I walked behind the counter of Santiago's meat store in Lanjaron, Spain, and Santiago handed me the knife. I began slicing thin sheets of jamon Iberico (Spanish prosciutto), as I'd watched him do, and placed the pieces on a sheet of wax paper. Then I bought some wine, sheep milk manchego, olive oil and a half pound of "Secreto Iberico" -- Iberian Secret.      I had first encountered Iberian Secret in a restaurant in the nearby town of Orgiva, where it was used to flavor sauteed artichokes. It's a secret I do not intend to keep.      "Food is either fatty, or sinful," Santiago said in Spanish.      "You two are like, the exact same person," observed my wife.      Down the street, I bought a sack of fresh raw almonds and a jar of local honey, two ingredients that seemed made for one another, from a man who ended the transaction with a sermon on the evils of plastic bags. We then walked up a steep hill to the Mercado Central for some avocados, onions, garlic, escarole and artichokes.      From the street food stand to the white tablecloth, I'm as omnivorous as they come, and my big mouth is an open door to all types of food, in all contexts. But while dining out is a fun treat, it can divert you from culinary experiences that are a lot more meaningful. I consider restaurants to be gateways to a new food scene, rather than the goal.      I'm writing today from Andalusia, in southern Spain. My family came here to wait out mud season back home, while spring is in full swing here. Today, here, the air smells like a mix of almond and citrus blossoms. The fruits and vegetables of the original Mediterranean climate burst from the ground and drip from the trees like a palate of perfectly mixed paints, and there is nothing I'd rather do than get my hands on those art supplies and make my own creations. But I don't need to reinvent the wheel. So I hit a few restaurants to see what chefs do with the local produce in order to orient myself to the possibilities of these ingredients, and to be inspired as I mess around with the fruits of the terroir. Then I got to work in the kitchen of my rental house.      Playing with local ingredients offers a ground-level view of a place that is only available to those who dare descend the pampered throne of being served by cooks and waiters. Whether I'm making my usual recipes with local versions of familiar ingredients, or learning new ways to use them altogether, cooking on the road is my favorite way to explore. When you ingest particles of a new place into your body, that landscape, and the culture of the people who coax food from it, become a part of you. It's hard to imagine a more meaningful communion. With your feet on the ground you are no longer a tourist, but a local in training.   Tortilla de huevo is a Spanish-style omelet. It traditionally resembles a flat pancake, but since my flipping skills aren't great, I make a Western-style folded omelet, or simply stir it up like scrambled eggs. Secreto Iberico is cut from the front of the pork belly, also known as bacon. So you could call this meal bacon and eggs and not be wrong. That said, this is not your mama's bacon and eggs.      Scrambled tortilla de huevo con Secreto Iberico   Makes 1 serving   • 2 slices of bacon, minced (if the bacon is too "sinful": 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil)   • 1 clove garlic, minced   • ¼ cup minced onion   • 1 small diced tomato   • 2 eggs   • 1-2 tablespoons crumbled sheep's milk manchego cheese   • ½ cup parsley      Fry the bacon in an omelet pan, and remove the crispy pieces from the pan. If there isn't enough bacon grease remaining in the pan, add some olive oil.      On medium heat, fry the garlic, onion and tomato.      While that's going on, beat the eggs in a bowl with the cheese.      When the garlic, onion and tomato are cooked down, about 10 minutes, add the parsley, mix it in, and cook for 1 minute.      Remove the contents of the pan, but leave the grease, and add more olive oil if the pan looks too sinful, as Santiago would say. Pour in the beaten eggs, and let cook for about a minute. Add the veggies and bacon, and fold or scramble the omelet.

El ministro de Economia, Martin Guzman, asevero hoy que la deuda argentina es "no financiable, inasequible e insustentable" en las actuales condiciones y que el pais "aun esta a tiempo para llevar un proceso de reestructuracion ordenado", aunque ese tiempo "no puede durar para siempre".
    Mediante una videoconferencia, el ministro hizo un analisis de la insostenibilidad de la deuda argentina, premisa a partir de la cual el Gobierno realizara una oferta de canje a los tenedores de bonos bajo legislacion extranjera cuyas acreencias suman US$ 68.843 millones, repartida en 35 tipos de bonos.
    Guzman, en su exposicion -que realizo en ingles- considero "inviable" un superavit fiscal de 4 puntos del PBI para pagar los compromisos de deuda que actualmente tiene el pais, tanto con privados como con organismo internacionales.
    Ademas, informo que el Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) caera este año entre el 1% y el 1,5%, segun las estimaciones hechas por esa cartera, pero crecera entre el 2,5 al 3 % el año proximo.

    Las palabras de Guzman se conocieron horas despues de que el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI) acreedor del pais en US$ 44.000 millones, afirmara Argentina debera reducir su deuda en U$S 85.000 hacia 2030 para superar definitivamente cualquier escenario de potencial default.

"That is quite a lot more than usual," Ebbert said. "We normally have 100 to 150 absentee ballots in a spring election."
 The large number of requests led to the office running out of supplies, the clerk said.
 "To mail an absentee ballot, we need an outer envelope, an inner envelope and label," Ebbert explained.
 Having run out of some envelopes and then labels, the clerk was unable to find any at numerous stores.

 "There are so many different avenues of things going on. This is just another hiccup we're experiencing," Ebbert said.
 While assembling absentee ballots to mail adds a lot of work, she emphasized that it is a good thing in light of the coronavirus outbreak. Electors need not venture out on Election Day and yet can do their civic duty.

He cited a number of problems with such an approach: The military health system is stretched thin, civilians are better at responding to pandemics, and the armed forces face legal restrictions on engaging in domestic law- enforcement duties. In an email, Dunlap added that the military must remain focused on its most important job — waging war.
 The Pentagon “needs to make it known that it is on high alert to ensure no adversary tries to take advantage of the situation to conduct hostile operations,” Dunlap wrote. “This is why it’s so important that [the Defense Department] avoid the appearance or fact of being distracted by the coronavirus emergency, or that the capabilities needed for war-fighting are being diffused and dissipated.”
 Military leaders agree and have emphasized the work of the National Guard, which can be called into action by governors, to help with law enforcement, provide security, transport supplies and more. Battling the virus is challenging, these leaders say, because the whole country is under fire, even if some areas are hit worse than others.

Munoz was the Ragin’ Cajuns' passing game coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2008-10, wide receivers coach from 2011-15 and 2017, and offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in 2016.
 During his two-year stint as an LSU offensive analyst, one of his primary roles was to devise pass protection for Burrow. Minimizing blitzes was his specialty.
 That knowledge could benefit Baylor’s pass protection after the Bears ranked ninth in the Big 12 by allowing 35 sacks last season.
 “I handled all the pass protections and all the blitz pressures, the pressure packages by the opponents,” Munoz said. “I was known as the Blitz Doctor. That’s what the offensive line coach (James Cregg) referred to me as, so that was my role, that was my big assignment.”
 Watching Munoz work at LSU and knowing his background at other college football programs, Aranda is glad to have him on board.
 "Jorge is well respected in football coaching circles," Aranda said. "He is a great friend of mine. He puts the players first and is extremely innovative in his offensive philosophy and schemes. He is a great teacher of details that believes in fundamentals. He will be a terrific fit at Baylor."
 Munoz believes his ideas will mesh well with Baylor offensive coordinator Larry Fedora’s schemes, and is looking forward to spending more time with him.
 “I think the way Coach Fedora sees the passing game is how I see the passing game,” Munoz said. “He’s got his thoughts and I’ve got mine, and we’re just trying to mesh those concepts. But I think we’re on the same page right now and I think it’s going to be smooth.”
 Munoz and Fedora are joined on Baylor’s offensive staff by running backs coach Justin Johnson, tight ends coach Shawn Bell and offensive line coach Joe Wickline.
 “I’m fired up about the staff,” Munoz said. “It’s got a good blend of experience, it’s got a good blend of being young as well. It’s got a good blend of in-state type of mindset. The staff is getting along great right now, everyone’s working together. All ideas are welcomed right now. No egos involved. So that part has been really fun and exciting.”

Several states have already extended tax filing and payment deadlines. For instance, California had earlier extended the filing and payment deadline for state taxes to July 15. And, shortly after Treasury announced the extension of the federal tax filing deadline this morning, New York announced that it will follow the federal government’s lead and extend its filing deadline as well. Several other states have indicated that they are monitoring, or will track, IRS guidance on tax filing and payment deadlines, so it is fair to expect that a number of states will follow suit in light of the IRS extensions announced this week.

 “Any company in the country, small or large, charitable or non-profit, will be eligible for the scheme. Employers will be able to contact HMRC for a grant to cover most of the wages of people who are not working, but are furloughed and kept on payroll, rather than be laid off.
 “Government grants will cover 80 per cent of the salary of retained workers, up to a total of £2,500 a month, that’s just above the median income.
 “Employers can top up the salaries further, if they choose to.”

Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!      Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.      Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.      Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.      You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.      You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.      If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

Californias 40 million residents should stay home indefinitely and venture outside only for essential jobs, errands and some exercise, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday, warning that the coronavirus threatens to overwhelm the states medical system. The move, the most sweeping by any state so far, was an exclamation point at the end of a week of increasingly aggressive moves meant to keep the virus in check by forcing people to stay away from each other as often as possible.I can assure you home isolation is not my preferred choice, I know its not yours, but its a necessary one, Newsom said at an evening news conference streamed on social media. He assured residents that they can still take your kids outside, practicing common sense and social distancing. You can still walk your dog. Restaurant meals can still be delivered to homes.The announcement came after the release of a letter to President Donald Trump where Newsom warned the virus was spreading quickly and eventually could infect more than half the states population. A spokesman later clarified that the figure did not take into account the aggressive mitigation efforts that have been made.The governor said he doesnt expect police will be needed to enforce his stay-at-home order, saying social pressure already has led to social distancing throughout the state. I dont believe the people of California need to be told through law enforcement that its appropriate just to home isolate, he said.The Democrat who is barely a year into his first term also called up 500 National Guard troops to help distribute food. The move comes after panic buying led to massive lines at some grocery stores. Newsom also outlined a series of steps aimed at providing more space for hospital patients.He said the state has taken over a 357-bed bankrupt hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area, soon will announce the purchase of a similarly sized hospital in Southern California and may use dormitories at the states public colleges and universities. He also asked Trump to dock the Navys 1,000-patient Mercy hospital ship in the Port of Los Angeles.The coronavirus is spread through sneezes and coughs. There are at least 1,030 confirmed cases in California and 18 people have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Newsoms statewide order came after counties and communities covering about half the states population already had issued similar edicts. He said the restriction is open-ended because it could raise false hopes if he included an end date.However, he did offer a glimmer by saying he didnt expect it would last many, many months. Just before Newsoms statewide declaration, Los Angeles announced what officials there called a Safer at Home order that carried the same restrictions. Were about to enter into a new way of living here in Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.What we do and how we do it and if we get this right will determine how long this crisis lasts. In the letter to Trump seeking the hospital ship, Newsom said Californias infection rates are doubling every four days in some areas and that 56 per cent of the states population could contract the virus in the next eight weeks, which would be more than 22 million people. He later said the overwhelming majority wont have symptoms and will be fine but that up to 20 per cent could be hospitalised.If we meet this moment we can truly bend the curve of escalating cases, Newsom said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. It can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and those with existing health problems.Most people recover those with mild illness in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks, according to the World Health Organization. Also Thursday, Newsom asked US House and Senate leaders for USD 1 billion to support state and local health systems.He said that money would be needed to do things like set up state-run and mobile hospitals, housing options to help people socially distance and testing and treatment for people without health insurance. He also asked for assistance so the state can extend unemployment benefits beyond the usual 26-week limit, expand food assistance programs, resources for the homeless and tribal communities and boost childcare programs.He further asked for assistance for schools, aid to local and state budgets and transportation relief. While California has prudently built a sizable Rainy Day Fund over the past ten years, the economic effects of this emergency are certain to mean that the state and its 58 counties will struggle to maintain essential programs and services, he wrote.Newsom earlier announced USD 150 million of a USD 1 billion emergency state appropriation would go toward getting homeless people off the streets. He has estimated up to 60,000 of the states homeless could get infected..

The coronavirus pandemic is forcing senior doctors in Britains National Health Service to contemplate the unthinkable how to ration access to critical care beds and ventilators should resources fall short. The countrys public health system, the NHS, is ill-equipped to cope with an outbreak that is unprecedented in modern times. Hospitals are now striving to at least quadruple the number of intensive care beds to meet an expected surge in serious virus cases, senior physicians told Reuters, but expressed dismay that preparations had not begun weeks earlier.With serious shortages of ventilators, protective equipment and trained workers, the physicians said senior staff at hospitals were beginning to confront an excruciating debate on intensive care rationing, though Britain may be a long way from potentially having to make such decisions. Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in the English county of Kent, said local NHS trusts across the country were reviewing decision-making procedures drawn up, but never needed, during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic. They cover how to choose who, in the event of a shortage, would be put on a ventilator and for how long.Decisions would always be based on an individual basis if it got to that point, taking into account the chance of survival, he said. But nevertheless, there would be difficult choices. It will be tough, and thats why its important that you know, that two or more consultants will make the decisions.Sarkar said the choices extended not only to who was given access to a ventilator but how long to continue if there was no sign of recovery. In normal days, that patient would be given some more days to see which way it goes, he added. But if the worst predictions about the spread of the virus proved correct, he suspected it will happen quicker than before.Britain is by no means the only country that faces having its health system overwhelmed by COVID-19, but the data on critical care beds - a crucial bulwark against the disease - is concerning for UK authorities. Italy, where the coronavirus has driven hospitals to the point of collapse in some areas and thousands have died, had about 12.5 critical care beds per 100,000 of its population before the outbreak.That is above the European average of 11.5, while the figure in Germany is 29.2, according to a widely-quoted academic study httpslink.springer.comarticle10.1007s00134-012-2627-8 dating back to 2012 which doctors said was still valid. Britain has 6.6. MANY TIMES MORE VENTILATORSEstimates of the potential death toll in Britain range from a government estimate of around 20,000 to an upper end of over 250,000 predicted by researchers at Imperial College. As of March 19, 64,621 people had been tested, with 3,269 positive. The NHS is preparing for the biggest challenge it has faced since it was founded after the ravages of World War Two, promising cradle-to-grave healthcare for all.It was stretched long before COVID-19, struggling to adapt to the vast increase in healthcare demand in recent years. Some doctors complain that it is underfunded and poorly managed. About a tenth of more than one million staff roles in the health service are vacant while almost nine out of 10 beds are occupied. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked at a media conference on Friday, after Reuters reported the concerns of physicians, whether Britain could get to a stage where NHS workers had to choose who to save because there werent enough ventilators. He urged people to follow public safety measures.The objective of this whole campaign is to ensure we flatten the curve, as we have been saying repeatedly over the last couple of weeks, but also that we lift up the line of NHS resilience and capabilities, he said. That means there is a massive effort going on right now to make sure we do have enough ventilators and ICUs to cope.So how many life- saving ventilators are needed Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Sunday that hospitals had around 5,000 but that they needed many times more than that.The physicians interviewed by Reuters said, if ventilators were secured, the aim was to increase intensive care beds from around 4200 to over 16,000, partly by using beds in other parts of hospitals. Rob Harwood, a consultant anaesthetist in Norfolk who has worked in the health service for almost four decades, said access to critical care could ultimately have to be determined by patient scoring systems for survivability. Systems developed for SARS, another coronavirus that broke out in 2003, could for example be refined, he added.Once you have exhausted your capacity and exhausted your ability to expand your capacity you probably have to make other decisions about admission into intensive care. But he emphasised that, for now, admission criteria would stay unaltered We are a country mile from that at the moment.BECOME CANNON FODDER While shortages of critical care equipment may be most alarming, the coronavirus has exposed how generally ill-equipped the health system is for a pandemic.The British Medical Association said doctors have been asked to go to hardware stores and building sites to source protective masks. Some doctors are worried about Public Health Englands PHE new advice last week which reduces the level of the protective equipment they need to wear.Previously, staff on ward visits were told to wear full protective equipment, comprising high quality FFP3 face masks, visors, surgical gowns and two pairs of gloves. But the new advice recommends only a lower-quality standard paper surgical face mask, short gloves and a plastic apron. PHE referred queries about doctors worries to the health department, which did not respond to requests for comment on the matter.A senior NHS epidemiologist, who was not permitted to be named, told Reuters this advice was based on a sensible assessment of the biohazard risk of the virus. Its not Ebola, the doctor said, pointing out the risk to medical staff without underlying medical conditions was low. Matt Mayer, head of the local medical committee covering an area in south of England, said GPs had been sent face masks in boxes that said best before 2016 and that have been relabelled with new stickers reading 2021.If you are going to lead people into a hazardous situation then you need to give them the confidence that they have the kit to do a decent job and they are not just going to become cannon fodder, said Harwood the anaesthetist. The department of health said that they had tested certain products to see if it is possible to extend their use.The products that pass these stringent tests are subject to relabelling with a new shelf-life as appropriate and can continue to be used, a spokesman said. RAPID GUIDELINESDr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Medicine and a consultant in Leeds, northern England, said there had been chronic underinvestment in critical care in Britain. But she said the country was not yet at the stage where it had to make calls about rationing patient resources. She said, if rationing became necessary, medical ethics should still prevail and guidelines needed to be issued on a national level so that no patient was worse off based on where they lived. The NHS might also need the advice of military leaders, she said, on how to effectively triage.If we got to a difficult position where we had to exhaust every bit of resource in the country then, yes, we may have to change the way we approach the decision-making. Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, said there were plans to issue new guidance to give doctors advice on how to make difficult decisions if there was a surge in coronavirus cases, like in Italy.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence NICE said on Friday it would shortly announce a series of rapid guidelines on the management of people with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, including in critical care. The guidelines are not, however, expected to be prescriptive but to suggest leaving key decisions to individual doctors.Pittard said patients with pre-existing conditions who already had life-threatening health difficulties should be having conversations with their family about how they wished to spend their last days, in the event of them being infected. If I get coronavirus now Ive got a very high chance of dying of it, she said, putting herself into the shoes of such a patient. So do I want to die in hospital and when my relatives cant come in to visit me because its too risky, or would I like to die at homeAnd if I do want to go into hospital, do I then want to go to intensive care where my chances of surviving are minimal Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Pravin Char

Students who are stuck at home due to coronavirus concerns don't have as many resources as a school could provide. For example, schools that teach graphics and video skills often have educational licenses for Adobe's Creative Cloud, which are assigned to individual computers, rather than students. In other words, students can't simply open up Photoshop from their own devices. To help educators and learners during school closures, Adobe is allowing IT admins to grant temporary at-home access to its suite of Creative Cloud apps, from now until May 31st. Adobe hopes that allowing for easier access to its apps will help keep K-12 and college students on track despite the lack of access to on-campus computer labs. IT admins have to fill out a form, which Adobe will evaluate. The admins can then grant access by uploading spreadsheets of approved users to their Creative Cloud management app.\n\nThis is probably a good move on Adobe's part, especially in light of its strange decision to revoke licenses to old versions of its applications last year. Students can continue to practice their creative skills while cooped up at home, and messing around in Photoshop and Illustrator outside of academic pursuits could help kill some boredom, too.

Elgin this month collected $301,448 in sales tax revenue, an 84.58% hike in revenue compared to March 2018, according to state comptroller data.
   
 In March 2018, Elgin received $163,308 in revenue, data shows, meaning the city took in an additional $138,140 in revenue this month.
   
 "I'm aware of it but have no explanation for it," Elgin City Manager Tom Mattis said.
   
 Mattis said the increase in revenue is just an example of the volatility in monthly sales tax reports and the many variables that can influence a city's collection.
   
 "You may recall that last year we had a month where sales tax revenues dropped significantly over the prior year, which naturally raised a concern," Mattis said. "In spite of the staff's efforts to wade through the comptroller's system, we were not able to gain a clear understanding as to exactly why that happened. Today, we received the most current sales tax information, and as you've noticed, the city is way up from where it was the same month last year - also with no known rhyme or reason."
   
 Overall for the year, which Mattis said is the most effective measure, Elgin's revenue is on target with the budget projection for this fiscal year, which anticipated a 2% increase over the previous year, he said
   
 State comptroller data shows Elgin has collected a total $739,224 in revenue this calendar year, up 40.46% compared to the $526,272 the city had collected during the same three months last year.
   
 Bastrop, which collected the highest actual dollar amount in sales tax revenue this month, is receiving $1,341 in less revenue compared to March 2018 after posting a .24% drop in collections, data shows.
   
 This month, the city collected $542,227 in revenue. In March 2018, the city received $543,568, data shows.
   
 Despite the negligible decrease in revenue this month, Bastrop has collected $2 million in total revenue so far this year, up 12.17% compared to the $1.8 million the city had collected during the same period.
   
 Smithville saw a 34.33% increase in its sales tax revenue this month compared to March 2018, data shows.
   
 Smithville collected $48,809 in revenue this month, up from the $36,333 it collected during the same month last year.

Later at the briefing, Trump said he actually invoked the measure Thursday night. He declined to reveal any companies he had ordered to step up production.
 The president and the Cabinet officials who briefed reporters focused on the border as they moved to restrict the entry of people without documentation to the U.S. This follows a stepped-up State Department travel advisory telling Americans they should not leave the country.
 On another front, Trump said the Education Department will not enforce standardized testing requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current year. Under federal education law, states are required to administer standardized tests every school year.
 “Americans from every walk of life are coming together,” Trump said. “We are winning and we are going to win this war.”
 The administration is trying to overcome its inability to provide the needed masks and ventilators to hospitals on the verge of being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Numbers of local officials, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have warned that their medical facilities were about to run out of vital supplies, endangering both patients and health care workers.
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been working toward an aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would put money directly into American's pockets. The president has embraced the stimulus, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy and stock markets, which have been pummeled by the crisis.
 Mere weeks ago, Trump expected to be campaigning for re-election on the strength of a robust economy and now the nation is staring at a recession, if not worse — a difficult hand for any incumbent to play.
 According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

ST. LOUIS — Missouri students will get a break from school assessments, as the Commissioner of Education announced all state tests for the 2019-20 academic year are canceled.
 The news comes as social distancing kicked students out of classrooms and turned kitchens into classrooms.      "I usually work in the living room or the kitchen," said sixth-grader Javier Estrada. "I guess I like that you can pretty much work from wherever in your own house and you're just in the comfort of your own home."      Friday the Rockwood school district announced it would start an online alternative learning plan on March 26.      "I don't think this will replicate the daily education of our students within the classroom but it certainly will allow our students to continue to explore learn and grow," said Rockwood Superintendent Dr. Miles.      The program will allow students to work remotely while their schools remain closed.      "Were really trying to keep families with activities that they can do together, we know that this is going to be a hardship on many families," said Assistant Superintendent Dr. Shelley Willott.      Something Kairos Academies in Dutchtown has been doing pre-pandemic.      "You're still learning you're still basically at school," said sixth-grader Gabriel Estrada.      Gabriel and Javier Estrada are 6th graders at Kairos. They complete all of their assignments on Chromebook.      "Usually you go to this yearly tab where you can see your yearly schedule and things that are due," said Javier.      While state-wide school closures are only temporary, Javier thinks this style of learning may stick around.      "I think that possibly some schools would and the reason I think that is because this is a really good learning style and a lot of people are liking it and it also is very helpful for this modern technology age that we're living in right now," said Javier.

LANSING -- Michigan High School Athletic Association executive director Mark Uyl has a seven-year calendar in his office.
 In a matter of seconds, he can tell you the exact dates for the 2025 football state championship games, or the 2026 girls and boys basketball finals.
 If only he could come up with a calendar that covers the next four months.
 This should be the weekend for the girls basketball state semifinals and finals at Michigan State's Breslin Center, with the boys having completed their regionals earlier in the week.
 With the temperate weather we've enjoyed the past couple of weeks, spring sports would be off and running this week.
 But not this spring.
 Uyl is trying to grasp all that happened last week because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced the cancellation of college athletic competitions and spring seasons, put on hold play in the NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, and turned the lives of Americans into a free-for-all.
 "This last week, every time you turned around something was changing," he said. "What we were getting from the governor's office to the health department, from this league to the NCAA. I've never lived through three days where things changed as quickly as they did last week."
 That is why schools are now empty and the remaining state finals were suspended by the MHSAA, and the spring sports were put on hold.
 Suspending, not canceling, the winter sports playoffs was an interesting tactic, giving those athletes and coaches a hint of hope that they are not finished.
 Then on Tuesday MHSAA posted this tweet:
 "Hey, this is hard.
 Be Safe. Stay healthy.
 When the time is right,
 We WILL all play again."
 Some coaches and athletes read that and took it as a sign the MHSAA is definitely committed to finishing the winter sports season.
 That is not exactly the message the MHSAA wanted to send.
 "I think they're reading into something there," Uyl said. "If the time is right, when the governor reopens schools, I don't know when that is."
 The problem is no one has any idea when the time will be right, and that adds to the frustration felt by the athletes who never knew anything like this could be possible.
 "We're just trying to show some empathy to kids who are kind of in this limbo state that this is incredibly hard for all of us," Uyl said. "We just need to take our time and when things are safe ... "
 When that will be is not for him to decide. That decision rests with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Until then, Uyl's job is to be prepared for whatever action she takes.
 "Schools are closed until April 6," he said. "We're having lots of internal conversations, ideas, concepts and sometime after early April we'll need to get some more information out. Right now that's our internal plan."
 So for the next couple of weeks, Uyl and his staff will spend their time playing "what if."
 What if the governor re-opens the schools on April 6?
 What if, on April 6, she says the schools will remain closed for another six weeks?
 What if the governor says the school year is over and we'll see you in the fall?
 Uyl needs to prepare for every one of those "what ifs" and each requires a different response.
 Can the remaining finals for winter sports be saved? Can we find a way to finish those tournaments while spring sports are under way?
 "It's all on the table," Uyl said. "We just don't have enough definite information. I don't have enough information, much less definite information, right now, to be able to speculate on the spring or winter (sports)."
 The fact that the MHSAA hasn't canceled the remaining tournaments is a good sign. But the last thing Uyl wanted was for people to interpret Tuesday's MHSAA tweet as a sign that those finals will be completed anytime soon.
 "I'm not into creating false hope right now," he said.
 "What adds to the anxiousness is all of us just don't know what the next day is going to bring, what the next news is going to be. We're taking this slow, we're not closing any doors to anything, but making plans for a number of different directions."
 That the MHSAA is not sitting idly, waiting for an announcement from the governor, is encouraging. It gives hope to the athletes who want some closure to their winter seasons, especially in swimming, which was one day from finishing, and hockey, which would have completed its season last weekend.
 If nothing else, they know that the MHSAA is willing to be creative and go above and beyond the call of duty to complete those playoffs.
 "I don't think we can make definite decisions on what is canceled and we're done," Uyl said, "because I can't tell you what next week is going to look like yet."
 No, but he can tell you exactly when the hockey finals will be in 2024.

HAMLIN — After juggling a house full of ravenous teenage boys for multiple years, April Browning knows how to feed a bunch of hungry people.
 She is well versed in going with the flow. Knows how to find a Plan B, or a Plan C or D if she needs it.
 She's an eternal optimist.
 But.
 In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, all of those personal traits have become vital survival skills for Carnivore BBQ, the brand-new restaurant she opened to rave reviews in this rural community.
 “If this continues, our business probably won't even survive it and we'll probably end up closing down,” she said.
 Even for her, it is hard to be optimistic.
 “We were just two weeks into it; we were doing great," she said. "But I've got creditors that are gonna be asking for money next week, and if we're not bringing anything in this week, it's gonna be hard to pay those bills.”
 Things were already tighter than tight.
 “I only had $50 when I opened these doors,” Browning said. “We were strapped with everything. My husband had been laid off for three months ... our personal bills and everything, we were trying to maintain those plus open the doors, so we were pretty strapped.”
 Until the government-ordered shutdown, business was booming.
 “It's very frustrating, because we have so much invested," she said. "We've put our house up against this, so we can't just bounce back from it. If we don't make it through, then we have more at stake than just the business, we have our home to lose. I know a lot of small businesses are like that.”
 She never really expected to be opening a new business in her 40s. But she enjoyed cooking, her husband did too, and so it began as something fun, a good family project.
 “In 2017, we started out with two tents and a smoker, doing barbecue competitions; that's all we had,” Browning laughed.

Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!
 Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.
 Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.
 Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.
 You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.
 You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.
 If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

Kanawha County Commissioner Ben Salango is on the ballot as a Democratic candidate for governor, and I urge everyone to consider casting your vote for him.
 Salango is a longtime attorney in Charleston and a commissioner who has brought an energetic vision to Kanawha County and has dedicated his career of over 20 years to seeking justice for West Virginians who have been abused, neglected or mistreated. He’ll be a governor on our side.
 He is a lifelong Democrat who has spent his adult life fighting for the little guy. He knows how to get things done, and that’s what we need in the Governor’s Office.
 As West Virginians, we pride ourselves on pulling up our bootstraps and getting the hard jobs done. We have always believed that, with hard work and determination, we can do anything that we set our minds to.
 Salango embodies those West Virginia values and would bring them to the Governor’s Office if elected. Salango grew up in a two-bedroom trailer in Raleigh County with his parents, got his first union job at age 15 bagging groceries, worked to put himself through college and then law school and has not stopped working since.
 West Virginia needs a governor who will bring hard work, determination, vision and commitment to its people. I watched Ben Salango bring the community together to build the Shawnee Sports Complex. It was a project that people said couldn’t be done, and Salango made it happen. Thanks to Salango, it was built with union labor, and there is new economic activity in the Kanawha Valley.
 As a military man, I also know that Salango will fight hard for West Virginia veterans.
 Salango will bring all of that and more to the Capitol. I urge you to vote for him on May 12.

The prevailing theme of the recently concluded boys’ basketball season, other than the launch of a new rivalry between Scott County and Great Crossing, was waiting one’s turn.
 Each of the five selections to our inaugural News-Graphic all-county team proved that patience was a virtue, none with more resounding authority than SC senior forward Terrin Hamilton.
 Hamilton, who averaged 21 points and 8.9 rebounds per game on the season and was MVP of the Cardinals’ unforgettable 11th Region championship run, is our player of the year.
 Even with only season as full-time starter, Hamilton finished his career with more than 1,000 points.
 “He led us in almost every category, not just scoring and rebounding, but if you look at every statistic across the board,” SC coach Tim Glenn said of Hamilton. “When you look at someone like him, a 6-foot-6 wing who can score in so many different ways, I think the best is yet to come for Terrin. Whatever college gets him is going to end up with a really good player.”
 Junior teammates Aaron Leake and Elias Richardson join Hamilton on the all- county roster.
 Great Crossing representatives are seniors K.J. Tucker and Jaylen Barber.

The number of coronavirus cases recorded in Belgium surged past 2,000 on Friday and the number of deaths attributed to the disease COVID-19 jumped up by 16 to 37. According to the countrys national crisis centre, 462 new confirmed cases of the virus have been reported, bringing the total to 2,257 in a country of 11.4 million people.Two-thirds of the new cases overnight were in Dutch-speaking Flanders, in northern Belgium. Emmanuel Andre, a spokesman for the crisis centre, said Belgium was better prepared than Italy had been when it became the focus of the European outbreak, but that hospitals would need more space for the most serious cases.In the past 24 hours another 203 people have been admitted to hospital in Belgium, and 164 of them will require intensive care, such as breathing assistance. The average age of those hospitalised is around 60, he said. In Belgium we have 1,900 beds equipped with ventilators, and places are being set up today to increase this number. We are expecting demand to increase in the coming days, Andre warned.Europe is now the epicentre of the pandemic that emerged in China in December, with Italy now the hardest country. Belgium is now one of several European countries to order a national lockdown, although one less sternly enforced than in neighbouring France -- and with more exceptions.Already, bars and restaurants are shut and many people have been asked to work from home and to avoid socialising and crowds, but officials expect the measures to tighten. Everyone should respect these measures, and in my opinion, exceptions to the rules will come to an end in the coming days, another crisis centre spokesman Benoit Ramacker said.

Local golf courses all seem to agree that staying open and providing an escape for their customers is important during this time of social distancing.
   
 Still, they recognize the coronavirus is a real threat, and all local courses are taking precautionary measures to try and limit the virus' spread.
   
 Wilmington Municipal Golf Course announced Sunday on its county website that no carts may be used, no more than 10 people are allowed in the clubhouse at any given time, staff would be wiping down common areas every 30 minutes and tee times require 16-minute intervals.
   
 Wilmington Municipal is the only course the StarNews reached out to Thursday eliminating the use of carts. Magnolia Greens, Beau Rivage, Oak Island Golf Club and Castle Bay Country Club are all allowing customers to ride carts, but taking extra care in their sanitation.
   
 At Magnolia Greens, customers are allowed to ride in a cart by themselves if they desire and there are enough carts, according to General Manager Rick Ferrell.
   
 Magnolia Greens is, however, eliminating its bag drop service, asking people to leave the flag in when putting and has closed all drink stations on the course. Ferrell also said they have eliminated shotgun starts, and play is by tee time only.
   
 Over at Oak Island, General Manager Steve Isley said all staff members working the counter and regularly interacting with customers are wearing gloves. His staff has also developed a new cleaning schedule to try and wash down touch areas as often as possible. On the course, Oak Island hasn't made any restrictions but is encouraging its members to leave the flag sticks in and bring their own gloves. Isley said his course is booked through the weekend.
   
 Castle Bay General Manager Mike Watson said his staff is constantly disinfecting its golf carts with bleach water and other sanitation products. Watson says their bunkers are playing as "ground under repair," and all rakes have been removed from the golf course. He's encouraging customers to avoid paying with cash, keep the flag sticks in and maintain social distancing at the tee boxes.
   
 "Play with someone you know, and if you're sick, stay home," Watson said Thursday. "This is a very serious issue and we're all trying to get through it together, but we don't want people coming here and feeling uncomfortable on the course."
   
 Colby Ueiner at Beau Rivage said their staff will meet over the next couple days and discuss raising the holes so it's easier for golfers to retrieve their ball with the flag stick in. In the meantime, Beau Rivage is making sure everyone uses different pencils and taking extra care cleaning its pro shop, carts and any other touch areas on the course.
   
 And all of the courses with restaurants have closed their doors to indoor seating, but are still providing take-out food and drinks.

The British government will pay a massive share of private- sector wage bills to discourage bosses from firing staff in an unprecedented move to prop up the economy through the coronavirus shutdown.Today I can announce that for the first time in our history the government is going to step in and help to pay peoples wages, finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Friday. He said there would be no cap on the size of the plan which the government would fund by selling more debt.Sunak also allowed businesses to hold on to 30 billion pounds 35 billion of value-added tax VAT, which they would normally pass on to tax authorities over the next three months. That is a direct injection of over 30 billion pounds of cash to businesses, equivalent to 1.5 of GDP, he said at a news conference to announce measures to support the economy.Moments earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms, nightclubs and other businesses from Friday to slow the spread of the virus. Sterling weakened by around a cent against the U.S. dollar and the euro as Johnson announced the shutdown and Sunak set out measures to mitigate its impact.Sunak, who has announced tens of billions of pounds worth of other measures to help companies this month, said the government would give grants to cover 80 of workers salaries - up to 2,500 pounds 2,930 a month each - if firms kept them on. The truth is we are already seeing job losses and there may be more to come, Sunak said. I cannot promise you that no one will face hardship in the weeks ahead.NEED FOR SPEED The 39-year-old former Goldman Sachs analyst, in the job for just over a month, said the grant system for helping meet the wages of workers would be up and running by the end of April, run for at least three months and be backdated to March 1.Other measures included an extra 7 billion pounds for the welfare system. The plan was welcomed by Britains biggest trade union, underscoring how the crisis has forced the ruling Conservative Party to abandon its traditional market-led instincts and rush to ramp up the role of the state in the economy.People concerned about their jobs and livelihoods will feel hugely reassured today that the chancellor has acted swiftly, said Dave Prentis, general secretary of UNISON. Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, urged the government to move quickly.The government now needs to go foot-to-floor to ensure that details of the job retention scheme and loan guarantees reach firms on the ground as soon as possible, he said. Sunak said a new loan program he announced earlier this week, offering up to 5 million pounds in emergency credit to small and medium-sized firms, would be running by Monday when further measures for the sector would be announced.Deutsche Bank said Britain faced a 4 contraction in its economy in 2020 and the unemployment rate could more than double to over 8. If the crisis proved deeper than thought, Britains economy could shrink by around 6, making it the countrys worst recession for a century, the bank said.On Thursday, the Bank of England cut interest rates to a new all-time low of 0.1 and announced a huge increase in its bond-buying program. Supermarket chain Tesco said shortly after Sunaks announcement that it planned to hire 20,000 staff for at least 12 weeks.Other countries around the world are also scrambling to come up with ways to temper the impact of stringent measures to slow the spread of coronavirus. In the United States, the Trump administration and Congress are negotiating a 1 trillion-plus package including sending checks of up to 1,200 to individuals, help for small firms and their staff and support for the health system.1 0.8574 pounds

UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who had pledged to do whatever it takes to save peoples jobs and livelihoods through the coronavirus pandemic, is preparing to unveil a further wage boost to his Covid-19 rescue package on Friday. The UKs Indian-origin finance minister had already tabled an estimated 350-million pounds loan and grants package to assist struggling businesses through the crisis. On Thursday, he held further roundtables to work out an employment and wage subsidy package to try to protect millions of jobs. Business groups and union leaders held late night discussions with the Chancellor to push for help to pay wages and prevent businesses from collapsing and wiping out thousands of jobs.We are working round the clock to deliver further support to individuals and families whose jobs and incomes will be affected by Covid-19 and to do so urgently, said Sunak, in reference to his latest set of meetings. We are in this together, and will all have to play our part, he said.During his weekly briefing from Downing Street on Thursday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had indicated that Sunak was working on further help to be announced on Friday as he urged struggling businesses to stick by their employees, because were all going to need them. Carolyn Fairbairn, Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry, said Firms will do all they can to help employees through these unprecedented times. But the exponential growth of the economic impact requires an urgent, bold new approach to protect pay and livelihoods.The Chancellors commitment to go further, at speed is right together we must deliver it within days, not weeks. The UK government said it has already announced expansions in eligibility for welfare support and a hardship fund to support the most vulnerable, as well as support to businesses to help with cash flow and paying wage bills. As well as providing emergency support to business, it is essential that money goes into workers pockets now. We must do whatever it takes to stop businesses going to the wall and workers being plunged into poverty, said Frances OGrady, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress.Mike Cherry, National Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, added Its vital that money is available on the front-line now. We have seen an escalation in the health response now it is right for there to be an escalation in the economic response. One proposal said to be under discussion is for the UK to follow the lead of countries such as Denmark, where the government has promised to cover 75 per cent of salaries at private companies for three months, if they promise not to let staff go. The Bank of England has cut interest rates twice in a little over a week to try to provide support to the UK economy, while lenders are preparing to offer a three-month mortgage holiday to homeowners in financial difficulty due to the virus.

Italy imposed further draconian restrictions on public life on Friday in an increasingly desperate effort to halt coronavirus infections after the death toll leaped by 627 in a single day, by far the biggest 24-hour rise recorded anywhere.The mayor of the most badly affected city, Bergamo in the affluent northern region of Lombardy, said the true number of fatalities from the pandemic in his area was four times higher than was officially reported so far. Many of the elderly are dying in their houses or in old peoples homes, without anyone testing them either before or after they die, Giorgio Gori told the Huffington Post.He added that a dozen mayors of other cities had confirmed the same thing to him. Responding to requests by the governors of the worst-hit regions, the national government in Rome said that from Saturday all parks would be closed and people could only take exercise around their homes.We have to do even more to contain the infections. Correct behavior from everyone is essential to win this battle, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said after signing the latest directive. Authorities have become frustrated in recent days to see people still out and about despite their appeals to stay indoors for all but absolutely essential needs.The latest crackdown effectively bans jogging and bicycle rides, the only types of outdoor exercise that were allowed. We already have many hundreds of dead. What more is needed before people understand the tragedy we are facing said Sergio Venturi, head of the coronavirus response team in Emilia-Romagna, another wealthy northern region hard-hit by the virus.The national death toll surged by 627 over the past 24 hours to 4,032 - by far the worlds largest daily rise in absolute terms since the contagion emerged a month ago. WORSE THAN CHINAItaly overtook China on Thursday as the country to register the most deaths from the respiratory disease. Before Friday, it had never recorded more than 475 fatalities in a single day. The total number of cases climbed to 47,021 from a previous 41,035, the Civil Protection Agency said.Maybe the peak wont come next week, but the week after, the agencys chief, Angelo Borrelli, told Rai radio. Lombardy, at the epicenter of the epidemic, said that about 100 soldiers would soon be deployed to help local police enforce the lockdown, and called on the national government to impose new measures to make sure Italians stay at home.Officials are especially worried about the situation in Milan, Lombardys capital and Italys second city. The countrys largest cities had so far been relatively lightly hit by the outbreak, but there are now 3,804 people infected in Milan, its financial hub, and the surrounding hinterland.The number of new cases in and around Milan rose by 526, or 16, the largest daily increase for any region within Lombardy. The front line is now in Milan, Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases unit at the citys Sacco hospital, told La Repubblica newspaper. I am extremely worried about what is happening...There are still too many people out and about.The Rome government last week ordered restaurants, bars and most shops to shut down nationwide until March 25. In addition, it shut schools and universities and told everyone to stay at home for all but crucial reasons until April 3. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday the measures would have to be extended in scope and duration but gave no further details.Looking to boost morale, all Italian radio stations, for the first time, simultaneously broadcast the national anthem at 11 a.m. 1000 GMT, followed by three iconic songs, Azzurro, La canzone del sole and Nel blu dipinto di blu. However, the national mood has grown gloomier this week as the death toll has risen inexorably.It feels like we are in another world. I dont know, it is a really bad feeling. I hope it will finish soon because really, this is not good, said Rome resident Anna Marcotullio, 53.

 The Patriots run game suffered last season when the team lost fullback James Develin and his backup, Jakob Johnson, to injury. It looks like the Patriots are being proactive this offseason to provide even more depth to the fullback position.
 According toa source, veteran fullback Dan Vitale has agreed to a contract with the Patriots. Vitale, 26, spent the past two seasons in Green Bay and the previous two in Cleveland. Last season, was Vitale's most productive in the NFL. He caught a career-high seven passes for 97 receiving yards.
 Last summer, Vitale made a good impression on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who said, \"In a non-disrespectful way, he has surprised all of us with his athleticism. Kinda look at him sometimes, you think meathead, weight room guy, but you realize he can run, he can catch, he can read coverages. He's been very impressive.\"
 The Patriots had interest in Vitale prior to the 2016 NFL Draft. They met with the fullback at the NFL Combine and Nick Caserio also went to Vitale's Northwestern Pro Day. Vitale was eventually drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round. He started his career on the Bucs practice squad before signing with the Browns active roster. After being released in 2018, Vitale signed with the Packers practice squad. He ended up appearing five games with Green Bay that season.
 By signing Vitale, it could be a sign that the Patriots are worried about the health of Develin. Last season, the 31-year-old's year ended due to a neck injury. Develin, a 2017 Pro Bowler, played a big role in the Patriots run game. Perhaps, Vitale will next season.

In China, the shutdowns to contain COVID-19 have stalled so many industries and kept so many vehicles off the road that the virus has indirectly saved lives by cutting down on the country's deadly air pollution. And no paltry number of lives either. Conservative estimates project that 4,000 small children under the age of 5 and 73,000 elderly Chinese adults over the age of 70 would have died in a business-as-usual scenario. Meanwhile, in Italy, which has now surpassed China's death toll with what is now the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in the world, electric power demand has slumped an impressive 7 percent, oil demand has dropped 7 percent globally along with a massive oil price crash, and in the United States, where the worst of the virus hasn't even hit yet, the gross domestic product is projected to contract at a rate of 5 percent in the coming quarter. While some sectors are crashing, however, others are picking up the slack--and then some. Millions of people around the world are learning to use Zoom and Slack and a myriad of other home office services as they begin to work from home. "In South Korea, Italy, and Seattle telework and residential internet usage have soared 40% in just weeks," tallies a Forbes report. "In France 80% of internet traffic is now Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix, and providers are pledging to ensure 'digital discipline.'" Internet usage, by the way, is still largely powered by fossil fuels. Yes, telecommuting is not a new invention. Lots of people have been doing it for years, and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics documented that 24 percent of the U.S. workforce worked from home in the last year, continuing a nearly decade-long trend of workers setting up their home offices.  Related How Chevron Could Win Big On "The Worst Oil Deal Ever" While these trends are not novel, "coronavirus isolation has already boosted that, and could be a watershed event for digital connecting," says Forbes. These new legions of telecommuters, their tablet-happy toddlers, and kids adjusting to attending school online are eating up huge amounts of bandwidth. This translates to a lot of families around the world ponying up a lot of money for their internet package and electricity bills as we head into what is certain to be a particularly brutal recession.  And that's just one side of the equation. For their part, business owners may be thrilled to be offsetting a lot of the costs associated with running an office in these months of lockdown. "After the virus clears and we're left with a recession, landlords may have a hard time convincing corporate tenants to keep paying pricey overhead for employees who still got the work done, remotely," says Forbes. "It can cost $20,000, according to JLL, to kit out the average 150 square feet of office space per worker. And, depending on your city, $300 or more per employee per month for rent, plus $50 per employee per month in supplies and snacks, and $20 per month to keep the lights on, air-conditioned and computers charged." But that silver lining that you can finally see as the smog clears That still stands. As telecommuters, well, telecommute, they will be driving their cars a whole lot less. This translates to much fewer carbon dioxide emissions, to be sure, but it also translates to a lot less gas. The dip in gas demand by your average citizen, not to mention all the oil-based industry that's currently shut down around the world, also means that oil prices, which have already taken quite a tumble, will remain low. Good ol' supply and demand. This will mean a lot of savings for a lot of workers in the U.S. and around the world--hopefully enough to lighten the blow of all the other costs workers will be taking over for their bosses.

Of the major war or proxy war zones that we have been covering here, Libya remains in its usual state of stalemated civil war, but that's also because COVID-19 has not yet taken hold in the country. Market Movers - Canada's oil industry has been hit particularly hard by the virus, bringing WCS down to less than $6 per barrel on Thursday before regaining some lost ground to hover at around $13 - still hardly enough for anyone to profit. As one might expect, Canadian oil companies are cutting their capital spend for the year to the tune of billions of dollars. Canadian Natural Resources is cutting its CAPEX by more than C$1 billion, Crescent Point is cutting between C$700 million to $800 million, Enerplus is cutting 40% off its spend or C$325 million, and Husky Energy is cutting C$1 billion, to name a few. - To assist its oil industry, Canada is thought to be preparing in secret a package to distribute aid to its oil industry. The package could be worth $10 billion and may roll out as early as next week. - Iraq was forced to stop production earlier this week on its 95,000 bpd-capacity Gharraf oilfield after Malaysia's Petronas pulled all 80 of its staff without warning in response to the coronavirus. Last month's production for the oilfield was just 60,000 bpd. Iraq has claimed that this will not necessarily affect Iraq's overall output. - Oman wants to join the ranks of the overproducers club, promising to ramp up production to its full capacity of 1 million bpd, up from its December level of 970,500 bpd and OPEC quota of 961,000 bpd. - Over 200 or some 20% of UK and Norwegian oilfield service companies may go bankrupt due to the coronavirus outbreak, according to Rystad Energy, which says the pandemic will hit the continent's OFS market hard and cut purchases by about $5 billion year-on-year. Stock Watch - S&P Global has cut ExxonMobil's credit rating from AA to AA and has warned that additional rating cuts to the oil giant are in store if it doesn't take care of its financial issues over the next year or two. And the lower oil prices of today will likely make it extremely difficult for Exxon to do this. Exxon has doubled down on its spending plans, even in the face of Saudi Arabia's threatened overproduction and demand destruction stemming from COVID-19. - But keep in mind that on Thursday, oil companies were thrown a bit of a potential lifeline when Treasury Secretary Mnuchin backed a plan to spend as much as $20 billion to buy crude to prop up oil companies. This could result in a slight boost to oil prices. Deals, Discovery & Development - Total and its partners Neptune Energy, Ithaca Energy, and Euroil Exploration have made a new gas and condensates discovery in the Central North Sea--the 'Isabella' find. This is the latest in a string of finds in the North Sea by Total, including the large Glendronach field. - In the coming days, China's state-run CNOOC Ltd is scheduled to load its first cargo of crude from Guyana's offshore Liza oil project. Production from the first phase of the Liza field is expected to reach full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in the coming months. The current discovered recoverable resources of Stabroek Block are estimated to be more than 6 billion boe. ExxonMobil affiliate Esso Exploration is the operator with 45%, while Hess holds 30% and CNOOC Petroleum Guyana Limited holds 25%. - French Total SA has reached an agreement with renewables energy developer Simply Blue Energy to acquire an 80% stake in the floating wind project Erebus in the Celtic Sea, offshore Wales. The facility will have a 96-MW capacity. The acquisition is part of Total's plan to invest up to $2 billion annually to expand its footprint in low carbon businesses. Total has also agreed to buy Global Wind Power France for an undisclosed sum. Global Wind Power France had a 1,000 megawatt MW portfolio of onshore wind projects, including 250 MW scheduled to come on stream by 2025. - South Sudan has delayed its first licensing round due to launch this month due to the oil price crash and the global spread of the deadly coronavirus. South Sudan depends on oil for almost all its revenues with crude exported north to Sudan's Red Sea coast. - Liberian authorities will move the country's planned April offshore licensing round online, despite calls to postpone it altogether. Nine blocks will be on offer in the Harper basin, one of the last unexplored and undrilled regions offshore West Africa. - Algerian state-run Sonatrach and Chevron have signed an MOU to initiate discussions for development and exploitation of oil and gas in Algeria. The move follows the signing of the new Hydrocarbon Law, which maintains Sonatrach's equity position in contracts at 51%, allowing foreign companies to hold 49%. Sonatrach also recently signed an agreement with Italian ENI on gas sales.

While some of my franchising brethren may think this heresy, I feel compelled to say that franchising is not right for every successful business. In fact, franchising can be a very wrong strategy for certain businesses and certain business owners.
 Those of you who've read my columns in the past know that I am a strong advocate of franchising. That being said, when someone decides to franchise a business, perhaps the most important precept to understand is they're starting an entirely new business--the business of selling franchises and servicing franchisees. And, as with any new business venture, there are risks involved.
 So how do you assess those risks? And how can you best judge whether franchising is the right strategy to pursue?
 The Downside of Franchising   Surprisingly to many, the biggest risk for companies that decide to franchise is _not_ found in the investment that's made in becoming a franchisor. A new franchisor can easily invest $100,000 or more in the development of business plans, legal documents, operations manuals and marketing materials--before the first nickel is spent on franchise advertising. But that risk is largely quantifiable and readily recovered for the franchisor who can sell any franchises at all.
 In fact, many people considering franchising for the first time will ask me, "How many franchises do I have to sell to make it worth my investment?" The answer can be as low as "one." What many individuals don't understand is that franchises are, in effect, virtual annuities--providing a stream of royalty revenue that may stretch 20 years or longer. If a franchisor can generate $20,000 to $30,000 a year or more in royalty revenues from a single franchise, even one franchise sale will pay the price of entry--assuming, of course, that no incremental staff is needed to service a single franchisee.
 Franchisors looking for early-stage hyper-growth see much more substantial risks. This is because franchisors attempting to grow more quickly need to hire staff to sell and service franchisees. They need to spend money on franchise marketing. And they need focus on the business of franchising-- sometimes to the detriment of the core business they've established. When a franchisor gears up for faster growth, suddenly it becomes a balancing act between the resources devoted to franchising and the revenues it generates.
 All of these balancing acts are manageable, of course, if you have a good plan, a sound concept and a qualified management team. But the one guarantee that franchising carries is that without a strong and replicable concept, you will certainly fail.
 More often than not, franchisor failures are a direct result of failed franchisees. Failed franchisees require more in the way of support. They pay less--or nothing--in the way of royalties. They stall (or stop) franchise sales efforts when they talk to prospective franchisees. They can destroy the franchisor's brand by failing to live up to brand standards. And they can be the source of litigation and bad publicity. In short, not only do failed franchisees threaten the franchise business system, but they can also threaten the core business itself.
 Thus, the first decision to franchise must start with an honest assessment of the business itself.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Jordan Cove LNG project in Oregon but set one condition Pembina, the company behind the project, must obtain all necessary permits for the construction from the state authorities, the AP reports. "Currently, this project does not have a green light from state agencies," Oregon Governor Kate Brown said as quoted by the AP. "I have asked the state's lawyers to consider all appropriate legal action to assure that Oregon permitting processes will be followed." Pembina has already applied for one state permit--a water quality certification document--and has been denied it. What's more, the Oregon Department of State Lands refused to grant Pembina an extension to submit documents requesting a permit for sediment dredging at Coos Bay in preparation for the construction of the Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline. The pipeline will transport natural gas from another pipeline that brings it into Oregon from Alberta and then Pembina will liquefy this at the Jordan Cove facility before exporting it to Asia. Its daily capacity would be up to 1.04 billion cu ft of natural gas. The annual capacity of each of the five proposed liquefaction trains will be 1.5 million tons of LNG each. Many would argue now is not the best time to add more LNG capacity, but most companies are betting on a recovery in natural gas markets over the next few years--and Asia remains a key market. However, it seems that the state of Oregon is not too fond of the idea, unlike federal regulators. "After taking the necessary hard look at the project's impacts on environmental and socioeconomic resources, the order finds that the project's environmental impacts are acceptable considering the public benefits that will be provided by the project," one of the commissioners that voted in favour of the project said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com

In China, the shutdowns to contain COVID-19 have stalled so many industries and kept so many vehicles off the road that the virus has indirectly _saved_ lives by cutting down on the country's deadly air pollution. And no paltry number of lives either. Conservative estimates project that 4,000 small children under the age of 5 and 73,000 elderly Chinese adults over the age of 70 would have died in a business-as-usual scenario. Meanwhile, in Italy, which has now surpassed China's death toll with what is now the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in the world, electric power demand has slumped an impressive 7 percent, oil demand has dropped 7 percent globally along with a massive oil price crash, and in the United States, where the worst of the virus hasn't even hit yet, the gross domestic product is projected to contract at a rate of 5 percent in the coming quarter.      While some sectors are crashing, however, others are picking up the slack--and then some. Millions of people around the world are learning to use Zoom and Slack and a myriad of other home office services as they begin to work from home. "In South Korea, Italy, and Seattle telework and residential internet usage have soared 40% in just weeks," tallies a Forbes report. "In France 80% of internet traffic is now Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix, and providers are pledging to ensure 'digital discipline.'" Internet usage, by the way, is still largely powered by fossil fuels.
 Yes, telecommuting is not a new invention. Lots of people have been doing it for years, and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics documented that 24 percent of the U.S. workforce worked from home in the last year, continuing a nearly decade-long trend of workers setting up their home offices.

Biden said Trump is "behind the curve" and "promising results he has not delivered and announcing actions that he has not even ordered," pointing to Trump's comments that don't match reality on the availability of coronavirus tests and a vaccine.
 He also criticized Trump for claiming to have invoked the Defense Production Act, allowing for a government-mandated increase in production of supplies like masks and ventilators -- which Biden had urged him to do -- while not using its authority to order American companies to scale up production.
 "When these things don't come through, you exacerbate their concern," Biden said. "Stop saying false things that will make you sound like a hero."
 Biden has faulted Trump for failing to put experts on the ground in China as coronavirus spread.

THE FACTS: Medical professionals said taking such action would be dangerous and would not kill the new coronavirus. Social media users are sharing clips from a 6-minute video that suggests that heat kills the coronavirus and applying heat to your nose will help eliminate it. The false claim is one of many around the new virus which doctors are actively trying to debunk. "False! Please don't. Our nose carries bacteria, as part of normal flora. Those bacteria may get confused," tweeted Faheem Younus, who specializes in infectious diseases at the University of Maryland. The World Health Organization has said that hand dryers cannot kill the new coronavirus and noted that the virus can still be transmitted in hot and humid climates. Dr. Jen Caudle, a family physician and associate professor at Rowan University in New Jersey, also confirmed that blowing hot air into a nose will not prevent or cure the new coronavirus. "Depending on how hot the blow dryer gets, I would be concerned with some adverse effects," she said. Doctors like Younus and Caudle are using their social media platforms to debunk myths around the virus that has infected more than 200,000 worldwide.

The mayor got into a squabble with a couple of members of the Riley County Commission this week, and — once again — The Mercury got caught in the middle. That’s because Commissioner Ron Wells went on another rant.
 It was a rather embarrassing episode for the county commissioners, but it’s illuminating about our local elected public officials, so I feel compelled to recount it all and put it in some perspective.
 The issue, of course, is the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Usha Reddi early this week was pushing for a local emergency declaration so that the government could order bars and restaurants to close, among other things. Her concern — legitimate, I might add — is the possibility that there are still Fake Patty’s Day revelers headed this way, since Saturday is the scheduled day for that annual drunk fest.
 To their credit, Aggieville bar owners have canceled their promotion of the event. At least two bar owners have announced that they’re closing for the week anyway. So it’s certainly fizzling on its own. But there’s plenty of evidence that people are not entirely on board with public health officials’ requests or requirements that people stay away from each other.
 Anyway, the mayor of Manhattan doesn’t have the power to declare a local state of emergency. That authority rests with the county commission. County commissioners reminded her of that, and also argued that there was no need for such a declaration, since there had been no local cases of coronavirus confirmed at that moment.
 Later on Wednesday, they changed course and made the declaration. But not before Commissioner Marvin Rodriguez made some cringe-worthy comments about how our area doesn’t really have a problem because it doesn’t have many Chinese people.
 Even trying to put the best possible face on those comments, they’re unproductive. The virus is being passed around by everybody. It doesn’t discriminate. And, I might add, the more we get on top of this sort of thing now, the better chance we have to stay ahead of it. Getting behind it ultimately will mean deaths. Minimizing it — and in the process ostracizing people of Chinese descent — is not in any way productive.
 Meanwhile, Commissioner Wells yammered on about our reporter, who has been doing the difficult job of keeping track of the local government’s response to the pandemic. She reported on the disagreement between the mayor and the county — since in fact the county did disagree — about the emergency declaration. Mr. Wells got upset about that reporting, saying we were “just trying to cause friction.”
 Uhhh, sorry. The friction exists. Mayor Usha Reddi said one of the commissioners called her Stalin-like. So, yeah. We didn’t create anything.
 We’re not interested in creating friction. We’re interested in conveying information to the public, and if there’s friction, we’re going to convey that, too. The fact that Commissioner Wells was quoted in the story that he didn’t know who had the power to issue an emergency declaration is not any sort of attempt to embarrass him. It’s just a fact, and is sort of telling about the times we’re living through. Should he have known that? Well, that’s up to you to decide. I am certainly willing to give him a pass on that for the moment.
 But, hey, just so we don’t cause any more friction, how about this? County Commissioner John Ford sure has had a good couple of days! Yay, team!
