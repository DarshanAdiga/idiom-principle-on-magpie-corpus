“Now more than ever is the time where we’re actually having a conversation about what these figures mean,” he said. As with many black Americans, Montgomery said that this side to the founders’ legacies did not exactly come as a revelation. It’s something he’s known all along. His opinion of the first president “hasn’t changed — because it wasn’t that high of him in the first place. He’s kind of been this hypocritical figure in terms of standing for things, but not actually doing those things in his personal life. But now nobody can claim ‘I didn't know the history,’ now it’s what can you do moving forward once you do realize the history.”

Northern Nigeria, like any other region thrives and progresses alongside contemporary innovation and global growth, while being in complete cognizance of the societal ills and where we fall short. The diversity of the Northern entity is barely communicated in terms of sub ethnicities from Hausa, Fulani, Kanuri, Nupe, Gbagyi and a whole lot more that varies in cultural values, language and norms.

Lidocaine, a widely used anesthetic in racing, is considered a Class 2 drug by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, and use of it carries a penalty of a 15- to 60-day suspension and a fine of $500 to $1,000 for a first offense. Without mitigating circumstances, a horse would be disqualified and forfeit its purse. Lidocaine's use is regulated because it can act as a masking agent.

I’m sad that I don’t have a tail. This absence deprives me of the opportunity to throw my tail up in the air and leave the room in style after sharing a witty or cutting remark. As wonderfully satisfying as that would be, many animals use their tails in even more interesting ways, extending beyond the well-known wagging of dogs and alarm signaling by beavers.
 Tails can serve as parasols, and that is how Cape ground squirrels use them. In the southern Kalahari, these squirrels use their bushy tails to create shade in the intense heat. Remaining under their own umbrella allows them to lower the temperature enough that they can forage over twice as long before their own heat load forces them to head back to their burrow.

While some social media users shared photographs of Maxwell and Trump together to imply that the president was involved in the British socialite’s alleged illegal activities (Maxwell has been photographed with numerous celebrities and politicians, including Bill Clinton and Michael Bloomberg), this account took the smear tactic one step further and pushed the unfounded claim that Trump and Maxwell had a love child.

Nobody on the verified list earns up to N1m per month. We also reported after the verification exercise that the pension payroll we met was dubious, that there were double loaded accounts and that we saved over N200m per month after the exercise. It beats me why the State Government will keep going back to mention problems we identified when we came on board and took care of, as if it happened during the Ihedioha’s time.

Cooper, a Democrat, had until midnight to sign the broader bill already sent to his desk or veto it. If he did neither, the bill turns into law. North Carolina governors can't issue line-item vetoes. Cooper's public comment last week about the bill and a letter to a top lawmaker suggested the bill would become law, but that the executive and legislative branches would work to repeal the records provision quickly.

Jane (Curtis) Quint-Collier died in her home after a brief illness. Jane was the middle child of Theo and Finley Curtis and older sister to Finley Curtis, Jr. She married E.L. Quint and had two children Nancy (Robinson) and Michael. She was fortunate to get remarried to Edward (Buddy) Collier adding eight additional children to the fun. In no particular order Eddie, David, Stephen, Jeanne, Judy, Kathy, Ellen and Laurie made for quite the fun clan. Gran, as she was affectionately known, was the quintessential Southern Lady. Her hair was never seen by mere mortals looking anything less than the best. Make-up meticulously applied and dressed to the nines, just to go to the grocery store. She was a grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother to so many no one knows the actual head count. She would baby sit at a moments notice and change a diaper with one hand while simultaneously cleaning the baseboards with another. At the young age of eighty-something she decided to see as much of the US as possible. She and her companion Dale Sanford packed up the pick up truck and drove through every state in America except Alaska, Hawaii and Oregon. Jane/Gran was especially close to her daughter Nancy who made her so proud. Despite the usual mother-daughter drama, the two were best friends and each others closest person. Her son, Michael who died suddenly six years ago was also a particularly special apple of her eye and we know the two are rejoicing in their reunion in the Big Upstairs. She was looking forward to meeting the big brother, Walter that she never met and seeing her beloved little brother Finley again. Eddie and David are waiting for her as are Buddy and E.L and so many other angels who left us too soon. Oh to be a fly on the wall of the Pearly Gates! That's gonna be a good party, y'all. Even with all the words written here, there aren't enough words to capture the love, joy and laughter, pomp and circumstance that Gran/Jane brought to us. She loved her people fiercely and fully and was treasured by us for 91 glorious years.

"COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive," Bottoms&nbsp;tweeted.She told MSNBC that she decided her family members should get tested again because her husband “literally has been sleeping since Thursday.” She said the only other symptoms she and her husband have been experienced are those similar to allergies they have.“It leaves me for a loss for words because I think it really speaks to how contagious this virus is,” Bottoms told MSNBC. “We’ve taken all of the precautions that you can possibly take. We wear masks, we’re very thoughtful about washing our hands, I have no idea when and where we were exposed.”Bottoms’ national profile has risen in recent months both as a mayor handling the coronavirus pandemic and amid the national reckoning on race that has followed a white Minneapolis police officer’s killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, on May 25.A first-term mayor, Bottoms issued a firm plea for peaceful protest as demonstrators gathered on downtown streets after Floyd’s killing — and for the protesters to get tested for COVID-19. She invoked Atlanta’s civil rights history and her personal experience as the mother of Black sons. She won plaudits from progressives after firing Atlanta officers for using excessive force during the protests.She has also been noted for earlier criticizing Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on his slowness to order Georgians to shelter in place and his quickness to lift that order.Bottoms was an early and vocal supporter of Biden, who has been considering Bottoms as his possible vice presidential running mate in his own presidential bid.Violence in the city has grown worse since protesters burned down a fast food restaurant where police shot Rayshard Brooks after he seized a stun gun and ran from officers. Armed people have been manning roadblocks at the site and an 8-year-old girl was shot dead near the site on Saturday. At the same time, some police officers have been refusing to answer calls, angry that the district attorney has charged officers in the Brooks shooting.Atlanta police again broke up the roadblocks at the site Monday, but that wasn’t enough for Kemp, who said he was&nbsp;mobilizing up to 1,000 National Guard troops&nbsp;after a spike in shootings in Atlanta.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Everyone these days seems to have an opinion or action on how to interpret the past. Some claim systemic racism characterizes U. S. history and the residual evidence, like statues, monuments, names of buildings, bridges and other artifacts of life, need to be removed to achieve some semblance of "social justice," a tricky phrase with many meanings.
   
 Blacks chant "Black Lives Matters" and white liberals feel guilty for subordinating and exploiting Blacks over the centuries. The Associated Press recently decided to require the capitalization of Black. That's OK. In my day, the Conquest of America by the Spanish was capitalized, but it's not fashionable today, and the conquest isn't even called the conquest anymore, but the Encounter. Fashions change. Christopher Columbus' historic First Voyage (of 1492 for today's generation of students) is now the first voyage. But let me suggest that history does not change.
   
 Capitalization moves up and down, Confederate generals are toppled, and even Thomas Jefferson, that old rascal who held a few slaves and managed to author the Declaration of Independence while running his plantation, is going down. That he fathered children with his black slave mistress, Sally Heming, and freed all his children by her, gives some reason to pause as we drag him down into the gutter of history.
   
 That he also wrote the most ringing phrase in the making our country -- "all men are created equal" -- is also true and it is worth more than a passing thought in a history class. It needs to be examined, like Jefferson, for what it truly means not only in the context of its time but also as it stood up as an ideal for our country to strive for over the centuries.
   
 As we drove old Dixie down, a song made famous by Joan Baez in 1971, "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," we are attempting to destroy our true history and replace it with some grotesque version that lifts systemic racism and victimization as the ruling principles in American life, from the Puritans to today. That's trash history pandering to identity politics.
   
 Other former slaveholders, like George Washington, are also feeling the lash of political correctness. But have we smoked them all out?
   
 The founders of that great northern liberal bastion of scholarship and learning in Rhode Island, Brown University, were slave traders. From 1700 to the end of the slave trade in the nineteenth century, more than 60 percent of North American ships involved in the African slave trade were based in Rhode Island. Liberal activists waging war against history might head north to Rhode Island and Connecticut and smoke out many a Yankee fortune begun on the gruesome slave trade after they finish pulling down the last Confederate statue in the South.
   
 This is an example of two very disturbing trends at work in America today. One, it is historical ignorance and self-serving arrogance gone to seed, and, two, rewriting any history to suit your politics is one of the critical steps leading to the creation of totalitarian states, usually but not always socialist or communist, in today's world.
   
 To do so, one has to purge the past, indict the defenders of the old orders, and create a "new" reality. That is happening among those determined to create a new state based largely on the destruction of the old state. Their mantra is that America emerged largely as an evil enterprise built not only on slavery, but also driven by pure greed and selfishness.
   
 Concepts such as liberty and freedom only served to cover the interests of the rich and mighty whites who straddled over minorities to craft their engines of power and wealth. Only by destroying these can a truly egalitarian world emerge, guided, and led of course by the enlightened minority now rioting. See the Soviet Union for one example of this vision; try Cuba for another. The list goes on and on of failed authoritarian states devoted to making the world over courtesy of the new leaders in power.
   
 To any student of history, the above analysis is so crystal clear that one wonders how it can be so easily ignored among the brokers of power and politics across the nation.
   
 History is like your memory. It is part of your being. You may try to erase or rewrite your personal history to suit your purposes, but you cannot change it. What you CAN change is the present and future. If it is pointing to a social and cultural debacle promoted by revolutionaries, anarchists, fire bombers, and statue topplers, then step in and change it. Liberty and freedoms will always trump tyranny and repression.
   
 So many are afraid to speak the truth for fear of being criticized as being racially insensitive, not caring but insulting or offensive. Lose the battle of speaking the truth and you move one step further away from it. Rather, embrace the truth of the past and it will be your guide for the future. My bias is that the truth is always to be found in scripture that blesses us and lifts us out of ourselves. That's a lesson for another day.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Two storied magazines that focus on news and culture in the Black community, Essence and Ebony, are in the midst of turmoil at their top levels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Finally, after five years of legal wrangling, things are getting back to normal, back to where they should have been all along.
 I am referring to wildlife management in Alaska and the changes there affirming wildlife management in all the other states. Wildlife management has almost always been and should always be local and scientifically driven.
 You want to see the tyranny of the majority, look at the Wild Horse and Burro Act. It's a federal law passed by Congress that ties the hands of state wildlife managers in California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Oregon, costs billions of dollars annually, does not result in any coherent, practical management of feral and exotic horses and burros on public lands, and has resulted in severe degradation of wildlife habitat across those states.

Cooper, a Democrat, had until midnight to sign the broader bill already sent to his desk or veto it. If he did neither, the bill turns into law. North Carolina governors can't issue line-item vetoes. Cooper's public comment last week about the bill and a letter to a top lawmaker suggested the bill would become law, but that the executive and legislative branches would work to repeal the records provision quickly.

Some will be sad about Evans’ departure. Certainly, after Terry Wogan had the job on and off for nearly 30 years, the Radio 2 breakfast show was seen as a job for life. There will be those who’ll mourn the opportunity to witness Evans warping the show off into weird little avenues as he gets older, as his predecessor did. But tough luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

 The Revolutionary War was over. Our nation was governed by the Constitution.The United States had more than doubled its size under the Thomas Jefferson administration's Louisiana Purchase. Explorers, trappers, fur traders, pioneers and settlers were crossing the Mississippi River in great numbers seeking adventure, riches and a better life.
 Who were some of these brave men who ventured forth to tame the unknown and ended up defending our nation against a second war with Great Britain in the War of 1812?
 Thomas Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1790, the son of a Revolutionary War officer. Two of his brothers had served in the US military with distinction. During the War of 1812, Captain Biddle became a war hero when he captured the only artillery piece at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. He also fought during the siege of Fort Eric. After the war, he was promoted to major and assigned to St. Louis as paymaster of the army.
 Daniel Bissell was born in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1769. His father and brothers were solders and military leaders. Bissell was only twelve when he served during the Revolutionary War as a fifer with Connecticut's troops. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1788 and moved to Missouri in 1804. He was appointed Commander of Fort Bellefontaine in 1808 when his brother Major Russell Bissell died. Bissell served with distinction during the War of 1812 and was promoted to brigadier general in 1814.
 Another prominent family that eventually settled in the Boonslick area was Benjamin Abbott Cooper, Sr. Born in Virginia in 1756, he was a big man, a natural leader and he served as a ranger in a Virginia militia company during the Revolutionary War.
 He fought Native Americans in Kentucky where he met Daniel Boone. Cooper and his family moved to St. Charles County in 1806. They tried to establish a settlement near Boone's Salt Lick, but as Native American claims still were pending, the territorial governor ordered them back.
 They returned in 1810. During the War of 1812, there were forts on both sides of the Missouri River, but most of the settlers joined forces on the north side of the river after the war. As in Virginia, Cooper served in the ranger militia during the war. On March 22, 1821, the same year Missouri became a state, Cooper's daughter Nancy married into the Sappington family, which was yet another prominent family in central Missouri's history.
  _Elizabeth Davis was born and raised in Cooper County, Missouri, and has written HISTORICALLY YOURS for the Boonville Daily News since April 2008, She has covered the War Between the States, US history, and Cooper County history.

WASHINGTON  -- After a weekend spent stoking division, President Donald Trump on Monday blasted NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag and wrongly accused the sport's only Black driver, Bubba Wallace, of perpetrating "a hoax" involving a rope shaped like a noose in his garage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Exploiting racial tensions, Trump suggested Wallace should apologize after one of his crew members discovered the rope in a garage stall they had been assigned to. Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose and has said he was saddened by "the despicable act of racism and hatred," and other Cup Series drivers rallied around him.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?" Trump tweeted. "That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The tweet came after Trump used a pair of Independence Day speeches to dig deeper into America's divisions by accusing protesters who have pushed for racial justice of engaging in a "merciless campaign to wipe out our history." The remarks served as a direct appeal to the Republican president's political base, including many disaffected white voters, with less than four months to go before Election Day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying in an interview on Fox News Channel that, "The president's merely pointing out that we've got to let facts come out before we jump to judgment."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying "I Can't Breathe," raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCAR's Confederate flag ban.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order.

The system swiftly punished Rosenthal for racially insensitive conduct that offended a staffer. The system shielded Hughes from having to address the harm caused to people of color, poor people and disabled people due to his mismanagement. Complaints and concerns from residents and nurse aids fell on deaf ears until some travelling nurses, white women from out of state, went public with details about mismanagement and appalling conditions at Coler.

Lidocaine, a widely used anesthetic in racing, is considered a Class 2 drug by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, and use of it carries a penalty of a 15- to 60-day suspension and a fine of $500 to $1,000 for a first offense. Without mitigating circumstances, a horse would be disqualified and forfeit its purse. Lidocaine's use is regulated because it can act as a masking agent.                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Now, this is all theoretical, and we have no idea of Kanye is being this strategic or not. However, it is an interesting theory. When Kanye came out as a Trump supporter in previous years, the conservative movement welcomed him with open arms. They welcomed him because, finally, we had a prominent A-list celebrity joining the MAGA crowd. With that said, if Kanye runs for president, he's not going to draw any votes from the MAGA crowd, since their support for Kanye West was because of his support from President Trump.                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The great leader took a deep insight into the requirement of the times that all countries and nations cannot achieve economic self-reliance and complete political independence unless the old international economic order, the product of colonialist system and the means for exploitation and plunder of the imperialists is demolished. He then wisely led developing countries and progressive people to carve out their path by dint of South-South cooperation under the banner of collective self-reliance and to build self-reliant national economies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The Revolutionary War was over. Our nation was governed by the Constitution.The United States had more than doubled its size under the Thomas Jefferson administration's Louisiana Purchase. Explorers, trappers, fur traders, pioneers and settlers were crossing the Mississippi River in great numbers seeking adventure, riches and a better life.
   
 Who were some of these brave men who ventured forth to tame the unknown and ended up defending our nation against a second war with Great Britain in the War of 1812?
   
 Thomas Biddle was born in Philadelphia in 1790, the son of a Revolutionary War officer. Two of his brothers had served in the US military with distinction. During the War of 1812, Captain Biddle became a war hero when he captured the only artillery piece at the Battle of Lundy's Lane. He also fought during the siege of Fort Eric. After the war, he was promoted to major and assigned to St. Louis as paymaster of the army.
   
 Daniel Bissell was born in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1769. His father and brothers were solders and military leaders. Bissell was only twelve when he served during the Revolutionary War as a fifer with Connecticut's troops. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1788 and moved to Missouri in 1804. He was appointed Commander of Fort Bellefontaine in 1808 when his brother Major Russell Bissell died. Bissell served with distinction during the War of 1812 and was promoted to brigadier general in 1814.
   
 Another prominent family that eventually settled in the Boonslick area was Benjamin Abbott Cooper, Sr. Born in Virginia in 1756, he was a big man, a natural leader and he served as a ranger in a Virginia militia company during the Revolutionary War.
   
 He fought Native Americans in Kentucky where he met Daniel Boone. Cooper and his family moved to St. Charles County in 1806. They tried to establish a settlement near Boone's Salt Lick, but as Native American claims still were pending, the territorial governor ordered them back.
   
 They returned in 1810. During the War of 1812, there were forts on both sides of the Missouri River, but most of the settlers joined forces on the north side of the river after the war. As in Virginia, Cooper served in the ranger militia during the war. On March 22, 1821, the same year Missouri became a state, Cooper's daughter Nancy married into the Sappington family, which was yet another prominent family in central Missouri's history.
   
 Elizabeth Davis was born and raised in Cooper County, Missouri, and has written HISTORICALLY YOURS for the Boonville Daily News since April 2008, She has covered the War Between the States, US history, and Cooper County history. In celebration of Missouri's upcoming Bicentennial, she syndicated her column statewide in September 2018 and encourages readers all over the Show Me State to submit topic suggestions for future columns to HistoricallyYours.davis@gmail.com

Daniels sang-spoke his way through his biggest song, "The Devil Went Down to Georgia" in 1979, but first embraced that style six years earlier with "Uneasy Rider." At its core it's a novelty song, with Daniels in the role of a long-haired hippie (not the long-haired country boy that was to come a year later) who suffers a flat tire and finds himself in an unwelcoming redneck bar. To get out of a fight, Daniels starts spinning yarns about a patron who is really an FBI spy sent to keep tabs on you yokels. "I laid it on thicker and heavier I went," he recounts. Alas, Daniels laid it on too thick in a 1988 remake, a homophobic song that is more unfortunate than uneasy. _J.H._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Tom Hanks’s script and performance are as solid as they are un-flashy in this movie. He's a steady presence, rarely calling attention to himself. That goes for Hanks the actor and Hanks the writer here, as the movie is designed this way, from his Captain Krause character on down. Director Aaron Schneider manages to find some decent tension in naval warfare, even if there's never a ton of style on display. It's just about military maneuvers and the confidence in an experienced leader to do his job. Go figure, in this day and age, the latter concept is proving to be in short supply, so seeing it here, filtered through Hanks' reliable nature, proves to be somewhat stirring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Angry and scornful at every turn, Trump used the totems of Mount Rushmore as his backdrop to play on the country's racial divisions, denouncing the “bad, evil people” behind protests for racial justice. He then made a steamy Fourth of July salute to America on the White House South Lawn his platform to assail “the radical left, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters," and, for good measure, people with “absolutely no clue.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Similar to the Wind PTC Guidance, Revenue Procedure 2020-12 generally provides a safe harbor for a standard situation where a project developer ( “Developer”) enters into a tax partnership with an investor (“Investor”), with Developer never taking less than 1% of all partnership items and Investor never taking less than 5% of all partnership items. Investor, who typically has greater tax capacity than Developer, takes 99% of gross income and loss (and thus, under Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii), 99% of all section 45Q credits) until a date determined by reference to either partner’s after-tax return, or a fixed date, known in common parlance as the “flip date.” Investor may also take significant pre-flip cash allocations during one or more pre-flip periods. Post-flip, Developer takes 95% of the gross income and loss allocations, as well as 95% of the cash, leaving Investor with a 5% residual interest.[3] Under these circumstances, subject to the various rules described below, the IRS generally will treat Investor as a partner in the project company (i.e. respect that Investor’s investment is equity, not debt for tax purposes) and respect the partnership allocations for section 704(b) purposes.[4]                                                                                                                                          *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Per questo motivo i rossoneri hanno deciso di dare una importante accelerata nei dialoghi con l'Eintracht Francoforte per trasformare subito in acquisto a titolo definitivo l'attuale prestito biennale del croato. Le prossime settimane saranno decisive per arrivare a un'intesa anticipata che permetta al club milanista di festeggiare la permanenza di un attaccante che sta maturando partita dopo partita.

Can they move fast enough to stop the pandemic?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   As a public-health director in Savannah, Georgia, Cristina Pasa Gibson spent her time in an office filled with calorie counters and yoga mats and the scent of jasmine tea. Then she started working on contact tracing, a no-holds-barred effort to stop the pandemic, and her office and her life were turned upside down. "I felt like I was in a Vegas casino," she says. "I didn't know what time it was, what day it was, who I was."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  She and her colleagues in Savannah and her counterparts in other cities across the country have been working frantically to trace the path of the infection and to find those who may have been exposed to the virus. They talk to patients, asking for names of individuals they have spent time with, and chase down those individuals and to tell them to remain isolated so they do not infect others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The pressure on investigators and contact tracers has been intense. "I basically lived in my office," says Gibson, describing the early days. "It was Groundhog Day over and over."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Today their role is even more important. The US now has the highest number of cases and deaths in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

She saw a "silver swan" class of older people dancing, and got a group of her friends together to try it.

"At the end of the day, Black Lives Matter and Black athletes' lives matter as well," Brown said. "I respect any guy's decision. My decision was to play just because I felt like it's bigger than me and it's bigger than my family and it's bigger than all of us.

"COVID-19 has literally hit home. I have had NO symptoms and have tested positive," Bottoms&nbsp;tweeted.She told MSNBC that she decided her family members should get tested again because her husband “literally has been sleeping since Thursday.” She said the only other symptoms she and her husband have been experienced are those similar to allergies they have.“It leaves me for a loss for words because I think it really speaks to how contagious this virus is,” Bottoms told MSNBC. “We’ve taken all of the precautions that you can possibly take. We wear masks, we’re very thoughtful about washing our hands, I have no idea when and where we were exposed.”Bottoms’ national profile has risen in recent months both as a mayor handling the coronavirus pandemic and amid the national reckoning on race that has followed a white Minneapolis police officer’s killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, on May 25.A first-term mayor, Bottoms issued a firm plea for peaceful protest as demonstrators gathered on downtown streets after Floyd’s killing — and for the protesters to get tested for COVID-19. She invoked Atlanta’s civil rights history and her personal experience as the mother of Black sons. She won plaudits from progressives after firing Atlanta officers for using excessive force during the protests.She has also been noted for earlier criticizing Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on his slowness to order Georgians to shelter in place and his quickness to lift that order.Bottoms was an early and vocal supporter of Biden, who has been considering Bottoms as his possible vice presidential running mate in his own presidential bid.Violence in the city has grown worse since protesters burned down a fast food restaurant where police shot Rayshard Brooks after he seized a stun gun and ran from officers. Armed people have been manning roadblocks at the site and an 8-year-old girl was shot dead near the site on Saturday. At the same time, some police officers have been refusing to answer calls, angry that the district attorney has charged officers in the Brooks shooting.Atlanta police again broke up the roadblocks at the site Monday, but that wasn’t enough for Kemp, who said he was&nbsp;mobilizing up to 1,000 National Guard troops&nbsp;after a spike in shootings in Atlanta.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

The Senate also would have to approve any repeal measure before it goes to Cooper. Senators aren't expected to return to work until Wednesday. The Republican-controlled legislature could consider several veto override votes before they adjourn, likely until September. Cooper vetoed eight bills last week, several of which were related to Republican attempts to essentially overturn Cooper's executive orders that have kept certain businesses shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The physical training will begin once the quarantine ends, with the screaming coming from a little farther away than in past years. It will conclude with what, in past years, has been a three-day sail aboard the Coast Guard’s tall ship, Eagle. But for members of this class, that will be divided into several single-day trips to allow for more social distancing on board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

But, for the most part, the crowds in D.C. were sparse. Many Americans were cooped up at home, where the same conversation that was happening in the streets was playing out on TV screens. Hundreds of thousands of people downloaded the Disney+ app this weekend to watch "Hamilton," the film version of the popular Broadway musical. That production forces viewers to wrestle with our founders' legacies, too. Hamilton's creator, Lin Manuel Miranda, is Puerto Rican, and the play features a diverse cast. But it valorizes some of the founding fathers who were being denounced this year. Miranda, introducing the film, says that "So much of what 'Hamilton' is about is how history remembers and how that changes time." A few days prior, over on HBO Max, "Gone with the Wind" was restored, this time with a new introduction from film scholar Jacqueline Stewart, contextualizing the classic that heaps glory upon the Confederacy.
