“When I was pregnant with my second child, my 70-year-old mother-in-law called to ask if I was still swimming at the public pool,” she wrote. “She had read in a print newsletter that swimming in a public pool could cause birth defects. It didn’t matter that no scientific evidence backed up this article; she wanted me out of that pool.”
 Now, she says, millions of older Americans are getting their news through social media, and they’re falling victim not just to political hoaxes but to the same sorts of health scares that tripped up her mother-in-law.
 “As a member of the over-60 crowd myself,” she wrote, “I believe we must teach older people to be smarter online, and soon.” She cited a recent YouGov poll in which 44 percent of participants over the age of 65 admitted they had fallen for fake news.
 Part of the problem is what the researchers call confirmation bias. The fake news stories tend to confirm what we already believe to be true.
 How can society address the problem?
 Nash suggests offering media literacy classes at public libraries, senior centers and other places where older Americans gather. These classes won’t necessarily teach older Americans how to search the internet as quickly as their grandchildren, but they can offer useful tips such as how to spot questionable websites and where to go to find information you can trust.
 Nash also suggests public awareness campaigns urging older Americans to think twice before spreading false information.
 “We all know an informed democracy is the only way democracy works,” she told NPR. “And if we don’t teach them how to evaluate what they’re seeing, then we are poisoning our electorate.”

Along with the long-time residents, Borla said the town has seen success bringing in new residents, and he hopes to get the population back up over 400 and even thinks they can get to 500 one day. New residents, including younger people with children have come from Wyoming, Kansas and Colorado and from as far away as Arizona and Oregon.
 “The couple from Oregon, they found us on Facebook,” Borla said. “They thought we were the most attractive little village that they’d seen, so here they came.”
 Kirk said the promotion of tourism has helped the economy diversify, but like most of the region, ag drives the economy, saying that when the farmers are doing well, the hometown does well.
 “Most of these guys have been pretty conservative, and they’ve been able to weather the storm,” Kirk said. “We haven’t really lost a lot of farmers out of our area, and I thank my dad and grandpa for a lot of that. Before me at the bank, they taught them to work along conservative lines, not being so heavily in debt, so most of them have been able to weather the storm. But it’s not good out there. We definitely need this thing to get turned around.”

 “They are the nicest restrooms on Interstate 80, and I think we’re willing to back that up,” Borla said. “We’ve had many good comments from tourists.”

Tomah's normally balanced offense was out of whack in the first half Friday.
 The balance returned after halftime, but it was too late against a very good River Falls squad.
 The Timberwolves got only six points in the first half from players not named Dylan Derousseau, and it haunted them during the final 18 minutes of a 66-54 setback in a WIAA Division 2 Regional semifinal contest at Tomah High School.
 "I love how we competed and answered and executed in the second half," Tomah coach Brad Plueger said. "We dug ourselves too big a hole in the first half."
 Derousseau accounted for 11 of Tomah's 17 first-half points as the Timberwolves faced a 12-point deficit at halftime. Plueger said his team had difficulty getting players open on the perimeter and didn't take the ball to the basket with authority in the first half.

When George Gallup died in 1986, Time magazine could look back and say that “he may not have always been right, but his attempt to measure what Americans wanted permanently changed the nation’s political systems.” Though a notable miss had come in 1976, and 2004 would bring another, by and large Truman and Trump have been outliers. Pollsters have come a long way from their straw-man huckster roots. Therein lies the problem: the dragon eats its tail. In a vicious cycle, polls can be right at the time but then we listen to the results and change our vote. Dems are desperate for the likeliest Trump- thumper. Those afraid a leftie batter like Sanders would strike out against the Donald turned on "Stupor Tuesday" to Sleepy Joe. Polls are a self- fulfilling prophesy.
 In our current poll-itical process, pollsters have become stars in their own right. Frank Luntz appears with Oprah on 60 Minutes to talk to on-camera focus groups. Luntz also assisted Newt Gingrich and Ross Perot with messaging, based on his polling prowess. Similarly, John Zogby has had a high success rate in race-calling, as has Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight. Of course, in 2016 they all met their Waterloo.
 Looking ahead to this autumn, we might bear in mind Lindsay Rogers’ warning of an Orwellian world in which we paint our elections by the numbers, and candidates gain traction thanks to an overreaction to numbers that distorts funding, reporting and voting.
 Do we cast our ballots for candidates whose positions we do not even support, if they have hard positions at all, because polls have identified them as likeliest to succeed? It’s pragmatic, for sure, but wanting something in the worst way is the surest way to guarantee that’s how one gets it. Maybe Warren is the Sanders we never knew, because her weak polling doomed her candidacy.
 On Nov. 3, we will reap for four years what pollsters have sown in their season. We will Gallup before we learn to walk.

Old-fashioned word of mouth is still a factor in sharing local news and information, especially at the neighborhood level for information about local businesses, restaurants and schools. In all 55% of all adults get local news and information via word of mouth at least once a week. Word of mouth is particularly likely to be cited by younger residents as one of their top platforms for community events. Adults age 40 and older are more likely to prefer word of mouth as a source for local politics, local government activity, housing and real estate, zoning, and social services.

Nearly half of adults (47%) use mobile devices to get local news and information. Not surprisingly, mobile is particularly popular for "out and about" categories of information, such as restaurants. And 41% of all adults can be considered "local news participators" because they contribute their own information via social media and other sources, add to online conversations, and directly contribute articles about the community. Both these groups are substantially more likely than others to use the internet to get local news and information on almost all topics.

But she said more unpredictable weather patterns and hotter, drier days will be accompanied by less “chill hours,” the overnight drop in temperatures that some crops need for their fruit to set, and that is likely to lead to a decrease in production and quality for those crops.
 Weather changes will also cause shifts in agricultural pests, plant diseases and invasive plants, a reduction in livestock health and increased safety issues for workers, Olsen said.
 Some of the solutions are sequestering carbon, increasing soil health, which will increase its capacity to hold water, and increasing irrigation efficiency.
