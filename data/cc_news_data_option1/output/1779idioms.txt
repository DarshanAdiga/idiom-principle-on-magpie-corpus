"Yellowstone" Season 3 will center on the Dutton family's conflict with the well-connected hedge fund manager Roarke Carter ("Lost" alum Josh Holloway), who seeks to build an airport and city in the middle of Yellowstone. Most of the trailer centers on the show's various characters threatening one another -- Beth Dutton (Kelly Reilly) warns Roarke that he is "the trailer park, I am the tornado" at one point -- or emoting with guns or alcohol. "Yellowstone" is a notoriously violent and tragedy-prone show, and the Season 3 trailer's myriad of threatening scenes indicates that the show is only going to up the ante in when the next slate of episodes premiere.

Taylor Penning walks by Summit’s softball field about once a week, thinking about how she should be out there playing with her teammates.
 But the Summit senior, more than most players in Williamson County, knows just how dangerous the coronavirus pandemic is in the U.S.
 Her great uncle, Gary Lindsey of Nashville, died of COVID-19 on March 29. He was 69.
 “We love softball, but there are way bigger things than softball going on right now and life is more important than playing a softball game,” Penning said.
 The TSSAA canceled all spring sports, including softball, in mid-April due to the pandemic.
 There were nearly 72,000 American deaths from COVID-19, including 226 in Tennessee, through Tuesday.
 Lindsey had a heart condition, making him more at risk. He was a retired truck driver who loved auto racing.
 “I’ve personally been affected and we weren’t allowed to go visit, so it’s like there’s no closure really,” Penning said. “He was a great person. He was really close to our family, so it was kind of hard.”
 Summit made it to the Class AAA Sectional the past two seasons, raising expectations that the Lady Spartans might earn their first state tournament appearance in school history this season.
 “Yeah, for sure, since freshman year we’ve always dreamed of going to state and I truly believe that this year was the year we were going to go and hopefully win it all,” Penning said.
 Penning, a two-time District 11-AAA Pitcher of the Year, posted a 3.20 earned run average in 2019. The Chattanooga State signee also played right field and hit .443 with 27 RBIs.
 “Taylor is an awesome fielder, so she only pitched in 17 of our 35 games because we needed her on defense,” Summit coach Jenny Stevenson said. “She’s one of the most athletic players I’ve ever coached. I’m going to miss her.”
 After finishing one win short of the state tournament the past two seasons, the Lady Spartans hoped to break through this spring with seven returning starters.
 “In our minds, this was our year,” Stevenson said. “They were seniors, we kind of started this thing together at Summit and so we definitely were planning on being at state this year. So, yeah, it was very devastating.”
 Stevenson, who became the first softball scholarship recipient at Tennessee in 1995, has turned a struggling program into a contender during her four seasons at Summit.
 “Before I got there, they hadn’t actually even won a game in the district tournament so we definitely were trying to make that happen this year and believing we were going to,” said Stevenson, a former All-American at Soddy- Daisy.
 Sports at all levels have shut down in unprecedented fashion and softball was no exception.
 “It’s really even hard to describe it,” Stevenson said. “As everything was kind of unfolding, I was, like, I cannot believe this is how this is going to end. Seasons don’t get canceled, school doesn’t get canceled, the world doesn’t shut down.”
 Cleanup hitter Carly Scott, a four-year starter, made a big impact for Summit. The first baseman hit .471 with 46 RBIs last year.
 Leadoff hitter Mia Apple, who hit .380 with only three strikeouts in 117 plate appearances last season, was another key player. She stole 26 bases, scored 39 runs and never made an error in center field.
 Scott and Apple also signed with Chattanooga State.
 Seniors Cheyenne Scott (pitcher-third base, Dyersburg State signee) and Caitlin Bennett (Page transfer during her sophomore year) have also contributed to the turnaround.
 Independence transfers Abby O’Rielly (outfielder) and Elena Escobar (pitcher- outfield, would have been eligible by postseason) gave Summit an upgrade.
 Summit got off to a 0-3 start with Apple sidelined by a leg injury and the offense struggling, but Stevenson believes the defending district champions would have turned things around.
 Social distancing made it difficult for Stevenson to tell her players about the cancellation of the season.
 “One of the other things that makes this so hard is you can’t see them and tell them,” Stevenson said. “It wasn’t like we could have a big team meeting and cry it out, so I just had to text the seniors actually because I wanted them to hear it from me and not through social media.”
 One player grieved at the field and another went on a four-mile run.
 As painful as it was to have the season canceled, Stevenson keeps things in perspective because several of her acquaintances got COVID-19.
 “A teacher I had in high school, somebody I went to church with here in Franklin got it, a couple people I went to college with, no one super close and they’ve all recovered and they’re fine,” Stevenson said.
 There have been over 3.6 million confirmed cases worldwide, including 257,207 deaths.
 “It’s kind of hard to even get your head around it,” Stevenson said. “It’s devastating.”
 Apple and Penning play for Tennessee Elite in summer travel ball, but it’s uncertain when the team will be allowed to compete.
 “As of right now, they’re hopeful but it’s all up in the air pretty much like everything,” Apple said.
 She wonders if her first semester of college classes at Chattanooga State will be online.
 “There’s no guarantee for anything at the moment.” said Apple, who will room with Penning.

The sporting world is loaded with stories of lessons on never giving up. The Detroit Tigers pulled out the “Rally Caps”’ in the1945 World Series and came back from a large deficit to defeat the Chicago Cubs.
 Coach Fullmer and the THS baseball team did not give up when they were outmatched, on paper, versus South Fremont in the district tournament in 2018.
 “They were number one in the state and everybody told us we were going to lose. My older brother Kolby pitched that game and I caught. We were able to beat them 19-2 for back to back district championships,” vividly recalls senior catcher, Dusty Hess. He said it is one of his favorite memories and giving up was not an option.
 When asked what he could take away from this lost season, senior 3rd baseman and pitcher, Carson Reiley, added, “Through all the wins and the losses, through the highs and all the lows, baseball has taught me resilience, grit and teamwork, along with how to deal with pressure, with defeat, with success, and has taught me appreciation.”
 “I’ve played since I was a little kid and it means everything to me. It’s super tough for me and the other seniors going through this but at the end of the day it’s just a game and we can all get through this,” senior shortstop Seth Christiansen said.
 Wins and losses come and go with time. The bonds made at Teton High School are a strong foundation for the next phases in life for these young men.
 Outfielder Dylan Hatch remarked, “It has been really important to me, being a really big building block for me, who I am today, meeting all my best friends and learning how to connect with people.”
 Boys who gained confidence to take on challenges, boys who stood behind their team and picked each other up when they were down, became boys who learned. The hardest lesson to learn was,“Not to take anything for granted, especially when it comes to baseball. I now know how fast sports and things can be taken away from you,” said second baseman, Parker Bleggi.
 As they experience a wide range of emotions — from sadness, to anger, to disappointment over not wearing the jersey or putting on the rally caps together one last time — it is the lessons of sports and the support of their teammates that give them the strength to move forward. They are determined not to let this one event define them.
 In the end, they remain as one, together through the highs and lows, forever “Teton Strong.”

Due to the city's ban on public gatherings of more than 10 people because of the COVID-19 crisis, only the graduate and their immediate family will be able to attend the sessions at the Thinker, Burns said. The sessions will take place within the next two to three weeks. Students will receive a phone call from the school to confirm their participation.
 Additional details will be provided at the end of this week on the Haverhill High School website at haverhill-ps.org, via email and on social media, Burns said.
 Graduation isn't the only way Hillie seniors will be celebrated.
 The school's annual Night of Stars event, at which students are awarded scholarships, will be carried out in virtual form, similar to the way this year's NFL draft was done, with players appearing by video at home as they received the news they were drafted, Burns said. This year, school officials are asking students receiving scholarships and their families to participate in the ceremony via GoogleMeets — and everyone in the school community is invited to watch.
 "We want to celebrate all of our students receiving scholarships and we'll be asking our families to participate," Burns said. "We'll ask each student receiving a scholarship to say a few words, then we'll put that link out to the community so that they can be part of the celebration."
 Prom remains on hold. While Burns said school officials had hoped to have the event over the summer, it will likely be pushed until the fall. He said a breakfast the morning of the Thanksgiving Day football game is also in the works, as is the rescheduling of the annual bonfire and other events lost due to EEE. The threat of that mosquito-carrying disease forced a variety of nighttime events to be canceled last fall in the early part of the school year.

The state of Missouri lifted its stay-at-home order Monday. Of the 11 states with the 14 member SEC institutions, only Kentucky and Louisiana are currently under stay-at-home orders. The University of Kentucky and Louisiana State are the only member schools in those states, giving them a possible extra hurdle to return to action. Kentucky and LSU aren’t alone, however; many states around the country still have stay-at-home orders in place with stronger restrictions than the ones in Missouri, Arkansas and other midwestern and southern states starting to ease restrictions. SEC schools might be ready to return to competition before other power conference schools due to their location in states that lift restrictions earlier than other parts of the country.
 If the SEC can play in September before other schools are ready, it’s possible it could start a season on its own.
 “There is room for different conferences to make different decisions,” SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said during an appearance on Jacksonville radio station 1010 XL on April 30. “If there’s a couple of programs that aren’t able, does that stop everyone? I’m not sure it does. But the ability for us to stay connected will remain important.”
 The next hurdle after local resocialization plans would be following the NCAA principle of getting a plan in place for students and faculty to return to campus. Without in-person classes or students being allowed on campus, it would be difficult for the SEC to rationalize having any athletic events. Missouri will be operating remotely through the summer, but its status for the fall is still up in the air.
 MU System President Mun Choi sent out an email April 22 that said the university expects to return to in-person classes in the fall. But on April 23, Choi said he was less optimistic about returning in the fall and mentioned the possibility of hybrid classes with remote and in-person instruction.
 Other member schools have announced plans for in-person fall classes. The University of South Carolina announced its decision Wednesday that in-person classes will return in mid-August and the University of Alabama announced plans April 29 to resume in-person classes in the fall.
 Acceptable resocialization plans don’t have to mean everyone is back on campus, which could be a good sign for Missouri if classes aren’t in person at the start of the fall semester.
 “The key is — some students are able to be back on campus ... We’re likely to see a phased approach,” Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott told The Athletic.

The root cause of Covid-19 is never mentioned in the media: eating meat. Eating pangolins or bats from wet markets in China caused this one. There have been very close calls recently with extremely lethal viruses from factory- farmed chickens and pigs. And there is always Ebola. The total value of the U.S. meat industry (about $1 trillion per year) is less than the bailout package. The economics alone say we must take a hard look at meat-caused deaths. It’s simply not worth propping up the meat industry at all costs. Current meat-eating practices make Covid-19 the first of a series of diseases likely to jump to people; look for another within a few years.

Nobody ever said the healthcare industry was an easy profession. Long hours, little sleep and now battling a worldwide pandemic.But the community is rising up to support these war-weary professionals.“We’re also seeing the best side of our community, that giving spirit." said Sharon Harrington, senior director of Novant Health Foundation. “Some folks give words of thanks, some give meals, some give flowers. So we love that we’re seeing the best side of our community."Hundreds of meals have been delivered to hospitals in just the Charlotte area alone. Folks in their cars with horns blaring to let front-line medical workers know they’re appreciated in Fort Mill, and now a new way to send good vibes to those who have been wearing hospital scrubs for days on end.“We thought let’s make technology our friend.” exclaimed Harrington.Novant Healthcare who runs Presbyterian Hospital in the Elizabeth neighborhood, set up a page on their website where you can go on and upload a short video, text or an e-card to your favorite hospital staffer. The thought is you can let them know how much you appreciate what they’re doing, and understand the risk they’re taking. You can also send a message to the general mailbox so all the staff gets to feel the warmth of a friendly smile.According to Harrington, it’s a heartwarming way to give back. “They can use this e-card, and they can send a thank you, and how are you doing, and I love you, to a patient, to a team member that’s on the front line.”For a medical professional who’s working so many hours their days seem to be blending together. This, to coin an old phrase, is just what the doctor ordered.“They need us each and every day to lift them up and say thank you.”In just 48hours, they’ve already have over a thousand messages come in through the e-card system.

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.      The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.      It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.      She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.      Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.      Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.      But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.      This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).      Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.      She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.      For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.      "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.

 It was just another example of getting back up when you are down for these girls. They learned how to dig deep and be competitive as well as not be too discouraged by a tough loss.
 Without a doubt, the Teton High School softball team shared some amazing memories. Senior Kylie Driggs’s top highlight was, “Winning against Kimberely in our Buhl tournament.”
 Kylie played right field and is one of those kids who puts in the work and is always the last one to leave wanting to field just “a few more” fly balls.

While grocery stores remain busy, many small retail businesses open in the Falher and McLennan area continue to struggle during the COVID-19 pandemic.      Falher IDA Pharmacy and McLennan IDA Pharmacy owner Barb Gardecki says COVID has hurt business at both stores.      “Business is definitely down, it’s a lot slower,” Gardecki says.      “People are watching their pennies and shopping online.”      Products for hygiene and cleaning are hot items.      “We’re selling lots of toilet paper, sanitizers and cleaners,” Gardecki says.      The pharmacy department continues to fill prescriptions, she adds.      “Dispensaries are still busy,” Gardecki says.      Red Apple in Falher has seen business drop from one year ago, store manager Michelle Dovell says.      “We’re down by about one-third to one-half the number of customers we had last April,” Dovell says.      “We have fewer people in the store, they’re spending more to stockpile.”      However, she doesn’t know how that relates to dollars and cents.      She notes that some items have been in high demand.      “We’ve noticed a lot more sales in toys, board games, electronic games and movies, to keep kids buys,” Dovell says.      “As the weather warms up, we’re also seeing more people come in to buy items for gardening.”      Sammy’s Steak and Pizza in Falher was back in business April 20 after being closed since March 28, manager Majid Riaz says.      “We were crazy busy the first week we re-opened,” Riaz says.      “We’ve been busy since,” Riaz says.

 ## 3\. Australia Targets COVID-19 Safe Economy By July But We 'Should't Get Hopes Up' For An Early Mark On Restrictions
 Australia will have a COVID-19 safe economy up and running by July, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday, as his government seeks to get one million unemployed people working again.
 It is not clear how many businesses this would see returning to full operations, though it's been reported there are plans for a three-stage reopening.
 Cafes, restaurants and retail are expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen, with strict social distancing rules. Pubs, where social distancing is harder, would probably be amongst the last to fully reopen.
 Australia has had less than 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Fewer than 1,000 people are still sick with COVID-19.
 Australia is on Friday expected to announce a loosening of social distancing restrictions with curbs on most businesses removed by July.
 "We need people back at work. We need the businesses open again," Morrison told Sydney's 2GB Radio.
 "We can open up in what I'm calling a COVID Safe Australia."
 Australian Medical Association president Dr Tony Bartone has warned state and territory leaders against opening up Australia too early.
 "People should not get their hopes up too high at this stage, because rushing to get things back to normal, without caution and safeguards, risks a huge setback for everyone," Bartone said.

Teton High School had been holding out hopes of saving a season that held great promise. The team would be led by six seniors and a strong supporting cast, said Coach Blake Fullmer. Fullmer has coached these seniors for their entire high school career. Seasons that included back to back district championships in their freshman and sophomore campaigns, and earning bids to compete at the state tournament in 2017 and 2018.
 Character is built on and off the field through overcoming obstacles.
 The fact that this team was coming off a season with a 5-8-1 record does not define THS baseball. This team was ready to show their determination and heart, and to bounce back and play with pride this year. Teton had a strong senior pitching unit composed of Seth Christiansen, Carson Reiley and Parker Bleggi, speed in the outfield to track down anything with Dylan Hatch and Dexton Maw, a great catcher behind the plate in Dusty Hess.
 Their bats were lively and confident to go along with their experience. The group had become not only teammates, but a family.
 “Teton High School baseball to me defines what it means to have a brotherhood. I may not have reached my goals this season, but I had the friends, teammates, and coaches to help me do it. I was ready”, said senior outfielder Dexton Maw.
 The words “Play Ball!” will not echo around the diamond this spring. The bleachers remain empty, absent of parents, friends and family. Parents that have sacrificed countless hours in support of their sons’ endeavors suddenly coming to an abrupt end, with little comfort or closure.
 Playing baseball was a rite of passage to these young men, as many of the seniors were following in the footsteps of their older brothers. Each school day they were reminded of this as they walked past the trophy case that honors the memory and accomplishments of relatives in this close knit valley.

Hanlin clarified in an interview Wednesday that he was not suggesting the governor's orders were unconstitutional.
 Gautney's two-page letter said that many businesses have been "terribly harmed" by the state closing businesses. He said that's not needed in Crook County, which has had just one COVID-19 case.
 Douglas County has had just 24 people test positive for the virus, 21 of whom have recovered.
 And Hanlin said the flu kills more than 500 people a year in Oregon. In contrast, COVID-19 has killed 115 Oregonians.
 Hanlin said he's waiting to see what the governor decides about allowing Southwestern Oregon counties to begin reopening. A group of county commissioners in the region have asked the governor to allow businesses in the region to begin reopening.
 Hanlin said it's frustrating that despite the fact that "we've had one death in five counties down here in Southern Oregon and we've done a lot of work to control this outbreak and we're not getting recognized for it at all."
 While we can't be careless, he said, since the virus is easily spread, "we're just fortunate that we live in a rural area and don't have the population density to cause that spread to occur so fast."
 Gautney, the Crook County sheriff, said in his letter that many people were worried law enforcement officers would arrest people violating the stay at home order. But that's not true, he said.
 "If a business decides to open, that is a decision the business owner makes. If customers choose to shop with that business that is that person's choice. We are a free society and able to make decisions based on common sense," Gautney wrote.
 Gautney summed up his philosophy like this:
 "I believe in supporting the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state of Oregon and the laws there of. I also try to apply common sense in the application of those laws," he wrote.
 While the sheriffs in Crook and Douglas counties won't act as the enforcement arm for the governor's order regarding business closures, that doesn't mean businesses are guaranteed they'll face no enforcement at all.
 Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration, better known as OSHA, is actively investigating businesses who violate the governor's orders. On its website, it cites Oregon statutes including the Oregon Safe Employment Act as its authority for doing so.

With shops opening up across the city as the lockdown restrictions were eased on Wednesday, citizens stepped out in large numbers to purchase non- essentials.
 Most of the standalone shops were open in the city. Although stablishments in commercial complexes remained closed, electrical appliance repair shops, hardware and electrical shops, tailors and mobile phone shops opened for business. “My mixer needed to be repaired and nobody was willing to do it during the lockdown. I am so happy it can be repaired now,” a customer at a repair shop in Woraiyur said.
 There was an increase in the vehicular movement since Monday, a traffic policeman at Salai Road said. “Many two-wheelers came out today, consisting of people who needed to purchase non-essential items and were unable to do it for the last 40 days,” he said. “The number of vehicles on the street was at 50 to 60 per cent lesser than a normal day but easily thrice as much as the last few weeks,” he said. However, there were no traffic congestions on arterial roads as larger vehicles- buses and autorickshaws had not hit the roads yet.
 Some auto drivers who ferried passengers on Wednesday morning were fined by traffic policemen. The auto drivers demanded an explanation as to why they were not allowed to ply when cars could. “We have been asked to remain off the roads while cars are allowed. What is this unfair treatment? We will promise to take only one or two passengers.” M. Kalyanasundaram, an auto driver said.
 With the number of cases increasing after people who returned from Chennai testing positive, the relaxation of the lockdown may prove to be costly, some residents said. S. Sekaran, Chairman, Citizens Forum said that a petition was submitted to the District Collector seeking his intervention on the matter as personal distancing would go for a toss. “I went to purchase some eatables in Thennur and had to return as a large crowd flouting all norms was waiting outside the shop. Not too many were wearing masks either,” he said.
 Mr. Sekaran suggested that a shop owner must take the onus of maintaining personal distance at his shop. “One of the employees at the shop can stand outside and ensure all those entering the shop are wearing masks and are standing at least one metre away from each other. When a fellow customer asks to keep distance, some people are angered and shout at us. Instead, the shop owner can do it and if it is not maintained, he must be penalised,” he said.

 Sturgis High School plans to hold a graduation ceremony for the class of 2020.
 Nicholas Herblet, principal at the high school, said a survey was given to the senior class, which voted to have graduation on July 19, in the hopes of having a traditional ceremony. The ceremony would take place at 2 p.m. at the football stadium, with no cap on attendance. If weather dictates, it would be moved to the gymnasium, with a cap of 10 tickets per graudate.
 Herblet said if large gatherings are not permitted on July 19, SHS will proceed with a graduation using an alternative plan that would allow for graduate names to be read as they walk across the stage wearing a cap and gown. Up to four family members would be allowed to attend. The plan would include student and staff speeches and graduation music.      Herblet thanked members of the senior class their feedback. He and his administrative staff believe this plan best balances the desire for a traditional graduation ceremony with the need to provide closure for graduates.

Glen Oaks Community College will hold commencement Dec. 18. It will include all students who were scheduled to cross the stage this week and those who will complete their degrees by the end of fall semester.
 The spring commencement ceremony, which had been planned for Friday, was postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
 David Devier, president at Glen Oaks, made the announcement today through a video on the Glen Oaks Facebook page.
 "We really appreciate all of your efforts to continue your studies," Devier said. "Many of you didn't start the semester thinking you would be an online student by the end."
 He thanked the college's faculty for changing their methods from in-seat to online teaching to help students finish their coursework.
 Devier said graduating students probably will receive their diplomas by June, and could request transcripts online even if the school is not open.
 "We know that this is not what you planned on, but we're very thankful that you hung in with us and we're pleased that we've been able to serve you," he said.
 He congratulated students for completing their studies and wished them well.

Carrigan Carpenter, graduating Sturgis senior, will be playing softball in college.
 She's excited for the opportunity and looking forward to that next chapter in life, where she will play for Kalamazoo Valley Community College.
 "I really am looking forward to the new challenges of playing in college," Carpenter said on her signing day back in February. "I'm looking to just continue to have fun and make memories. I'd like to thank my parents and everyone that has helped me get here."
 Carpenter was going to be the main pitcher for the Sturgis softball program this year before the COVID-19 virus shut everything down. KVCC head softball coach Morgan VanderBor said even though Carpenter is strong inside the circle, the Cougars love her versatility in being able to play at several positions on the diamond.
 "She can play in the outfield, she can catch as well," VanderBor said. "We like the versatility she can bring to the field. We are looking for her to play multiple positions for us."
 Sturgis softball coach Greg Brooks said he was extremely proud for Carpenter continuing her career at the college level.
 "She's a great hitter, can pitch, catch and basically play any position in the field," Brooks said. "I think she'll be a great player for KVCC. They are going to be happy to have her be a part of the team."
 Carpenter said she is planning to study elementary education once she gets to college.
 "I want to be a teacher. I like having an impact on young kids and seeing those bright smiles," Carpenter said.
 VanderBor first saw Carpenter play on the travel ball circuit. Even when she wasn't on the field, Carpenter was still having an impact on the game and that was an important part of why KVCC recruited her.
 "The way she was leading in the dugout, talking to her teammates and being encouraging to them was a positive for me," VanderBor said. "She was picking her teammates up and I like those types of girls. Leadership is a big thing for us and I saw that even when she wasn't always on the field, she was hype and energetic."
 Carpenter said she had a decision to make regarding what sport she would play in college as well.
 "I chose to play softball, but it was a tough decision," she said. "I had some opportunities to play volleyball as well, but in the end I think playing softball is the right decision for me."

You can send a card, you can make a phone call - don't you DARE text her - you can, if everyone is masked up to the max and keeping their distances, pay a visit. Or you can observe the day with moms other than your own. Some of the best - and worst - of them have been in movies.      So, in honor of moms everywhere, and of every sort, here's a top 10 list of movies that have featured mothers in pivotal parts.      "Carrie" (1976) - Piper Laurie made it to the Oscars with a Supporting Actress nomination as Margaret White, the intimidating religious fanatic mom of Sissy Spacek's title character who was regularly the victim of her crazy mother's penchant for punishment, and her irrational fear of not inflicting it.      "Flirting with Disaster" (1996) - There are many mothers in this comedy about Mel Coplin's (Ben Stiller) search for his birth mom. Accolades go to two of them: his take-no-prisoners adoptive mother, Pearl (Mary Tyler Moore), who won't let anyone get in the way of her own words, and his laidback hippie of a real mom, Mary Schlichting (Lily Tomlin), who knows the right way to talk people down from bad acid trips.      "Forrest Gump" (1994) - Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) is Forrest's (Tom Hanks) loving mom, a sweet woman who has oddball thoughts spinning in her head (about vacations, about the Ku Klux Klan), and is credited with the idea of life being like a box of chocolates. She also makes sacrifices for her son, like sleeping with his public school principal so Forrest won't have to go to a "special" school.      "Hairspray" (2007) - John Travolta was nominated for his acting in "Saturday Night Fever" and "Pulp Fiction," and probably should have been for his willingness to go so over the top - in both sight and sound - as Edna Turnblad, the lovable and ever-loving - and ironing and dancing - mom of Tracy (Nikki Blonsky).      "The Incredibles" (2004) - When Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter) is fighting the bad guys, alongside her husband, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), she's as fierce as they come. When she's back home, playing mom to her three kids, and answering to the name Helen Parr, she's loving and protective ... and still pretty darn fierce about trying to keep a semblance of normalcy.      "Lady Bird" (2017) - Laurie Metcalf's Marion McPherson is all over the place in moods and attitudes, and she's quick to dole out advice to her daughter, Lady Bird (Saoirse Ronan), such as explaining that being successful doesn't mean that you're happy. The two characters do a bit of verbal sparring, but there's nobody that Marion cares more about than Lady Bird.      "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) - Patty Duke won the Supporting Actress Oscar for "The Miracle Worker," but it should have gone to Angela Lansbury, for her performance as Eleanor Shaw Iselin, the conniving and downright evil mother of Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who values political power over the life of her son.      "Mommie Dearest" (1981) - There's evil and then there's its anagram, vile. Faye Dunaway got to sharpen the acting tools that would bring out the despicable side of Joan Crawford who was, to put it mildly, totally in charge of the abusive, passive-aggressive relationship with her adopted daughter Christina (Diana Scarwid). Definitely a disturbed, out-of-control mom.      "Mother" (1996) - Debbie Reynolds made it appear that her character, Beatrice Henderson, the doting mother of John (Albert Brooks) was a bit clueless. Oh, please! Sure, she wasn't technically savvy, and she didn't really know her way around fresh food, but she's a great mom who only wants the best for both of her sons. She's sweet and funny.      "Room" (2015) - Brie Larson is known only as Ma in this emotional storm of a movie in which she's kidnapped, made pregnant, and made captive in a 10x10 windowless room, in which, over the years, she raises her son (Jacob Tremblay). Larson manages to imbue the challenging performance and desperate situation with a great deal of light. And love saves the day.      All films are available through Amazon Prime Video.

Cold temperatures, strong winds, heavy rains and snow all seem to be characteristics of this year's spring season. Amidst it all, the cranberry vine is doing its thing and moving out of dormancy.
 The tender buds on the tips of the cranberry vines are vulnerable to frost so they must be watched closely. When temperatures drop to very cold levels, it is vitally important the growing cranberry buds are, just like your own plants. This risk of frost damage can last much longer into the season, sometimes as late as July, for cranberry plants than for your own yard plants.
 Cranberry bogs quite often have the coldest temperatures in the landscape. The reason is because the bogs are wide open and are the lowest lying areas of land, allowing the cold air to settle in. On clear, calm nights with no cloud cover, heat is lost from the soil and cranberry plants and radiates back to the sky. This creates a rapid temperature inversion, with the cold air settling near the surface, resulting in what is called a radiant frost or freeze event. On a cloudy night, the evaporating heat would be trapped by the clouds, keeping the surface temperature warmer. A thick cloud cover or a steady breeze are a cranberry grower's best friend on spring nights.
 Why is a frost such a big deal? Simply put, in under an hour an entire crop can be lost! Once this happens there is no way to bring the crop back and the grower suffers a significant, possibly devastating, loss. But how does a grower monitor for frost, you may ask?
 This is a done a few ways, but the majority of growers in Massachusetts subscribe to the Frost Service provided by the Frost Committee of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association, in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station in East Wareham. Each week during the frost season, the Frost Committee determines the average tolerance (the degree at which a bud can handle a certain temperature without damage) by variety of cranberry. The individual growers then adjust for their own locations, varieties and bud development. Additional tools used by growers include cell phone apps, and infrared and traditional orchard thermometers.
 Protection for the cranberry plants is provided by water. Modern bogs have irrigation systems that can provide the needed water. Have you ever been driving early in the morning and come upon a bog with sprinklers going? It is quite an iconic sight here in Southeastern Massachusetts, isn't it?
 Have you ever wondered why they are going when the sun is coming out instead of overnight? The earliest hours of dawn typically provide the coldest temperatures on the low-lying bog landscape requiring frost protection. Turning on the sprinklers can be done manually or through system automation. Many growers make use of technology, like cellphones and computers, and automation for gauging temperatures and turning pumps on and off. These systems can turn the pumps on automatically at a specific temperature and cycle off again when the temperature rises to reduce the amount of water used. As we all know, technology is not always reliable, so the many growers still opt to sit bog side in their trucks during the peak frost times to ensure their frost protection is functioning properly.
 While many people these days are experiencing sleepless nights due to the world situation, this tends to be a common occurrence during frost season for cranberry growers. Due to the temperatures the frost service started early and, despite the rainy weather, the nights have been cool. Already this spring, frost warnings have been issued more than the entire 2019 spring frost season. A night of forecasted rain usually means no frost warning will be issued, which gives the growers a night off from their diligent frost watch.
 While most of Massachusetts is longing for sustained warm, sunny spring days to finally arrive, so too are the hard working cranberry growers.

"Who would have thought last year when I started doing this, that I would be opening a restaurant in the current conditions?” he said. "It's scary times, but I'm sure I can make the best of it."
 Arguello had already started building out a space in the Hill Center for the new restaurant before the coronavirus pandemic arrived in Tennessee. That buildout was a costly investment, and rent payments will start soon whether he opens or not. Arguello said he needed to get the businesses operating to start generating some income.
 “If you don't open, you're still stuck with all the fixed costs,” he said. “From an economic standpoint, opening the doors and trying to meet that break even point (makes sense).”
 Despite the unfavorable conditions, Arguello is feeling confident. Restaurants that rely mostly on dine-in service have suffered the most during the coronavirus pandemic, but Arguello said he’s been talking to other restauranteurs with a strong delivery model who are making it work economically.

Dear Dave,   Should my wife and I tithe on our stimulus checks? She thinks we should, but I'm not sure. In my mind, we already gave our money to Caesar - so to speak - and now he's just giving it back. What do you think?   Luke
 Dear Luke,   Well, it's your money you're getting back. The government doesn't really create anything, it only takes money from us. And in this case, it gave you back some of what it took. I don't really see that as a tithing circumstance.
 The other side of the coin is that you really can't go wrong being generous. The tithe is your baseline for generosity. You shouldn't tithe or not tithe because of a set of rules, but if you're having a theological or philosophical discussion about the tithe and how it works, I think your reasoning is sound.
 It's certainly not a salvation issue, but generosity is a good rhythm to have in your life. And honestly, these stimulus checks are kind of like tax refunds. You gave it to the government, and now they're giving it back.
 So, in my mind, it's okay either way. I've just always had an attitude of when in doubt, it's better to give.   Dave
 Go ahead, knock it out
 Dear Dave,   We make about $70,000 a year, and we're debt-free except for our house. We're following your plan, and just started saving for retirement, but we only have $15,000 left on our mortgage. We can have that paid off in six or seven months, so would it be okay to go ahead and pay off our home as soon as possible before continuing to save for retirement?   Nate
 Dear Nate,   I'm generally pretty hardcore about sticking with the proper order while doing the Baby Steps. But in your case, with such a small amount left to pay on your home, I think I'd go ahead and knock that out.
 Most of the people I talk to still have six figures left on their mortgages. There's a big difference between that and the situation you two are in right now. Think about it, you guys could be completely debt-free by Christmas, and you've already started to make a move on retirement planning. I say go for it!   Dave

“Expanding our testing capacity in this way is going to be a very important tool as we go forward,” Republican Gov. Chris Sununu said.
 More than 1,000 of the state’s 6,400 nursing home residents have been tested, along with more than 5,000 workers, said Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette, who estimated the long-term care workforce at about 20,000. An effort to test every worker in Rockingham and Hillsborough counties has been successful in preventing outbreaks, she said, because it led to the discovery of asymptomatic staff before any residents were infected.
 Those efforts will be expanded now that the state can employ a different type of nasal swap that will allow nursing home staff to easily collect samples and send them to the state for analysis, she said.
 In the next two weeks, those swabs will be used to test all nursing home residents statewide, and the state will follow up with a sentinel surveillance system in which 10% of the facilities will test 10% of their residents each week. Plans are also in the works to set up mobile teams to test all long-term care staff every seven to 10 days.

The move last week angered the Bernie Sanders campaign, his supporters and, yes, Yang.

SRINAGAR: One of Kashmir's most-wanted terrorists, Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo, was on Wednesday killed along with an aide in a five-hour gun battle with security forces at his native Baighpora in Pulwama district, bringing the curtain down on an eight-year run that saw him go from a mathematics teacher to a terror mastermind with a Rs 12-lakh bounty on his head.   As news of Naikoo's death spread, the Union Territory administration again suspended mobile internet across the Valley and voice communication over all networks barring that of BSNL. Incidents of stone-pelting at security forces was reported in parts of south Kashmir and downtown Srinagar.   Naikoo and his aide, identified as Adil, were eliminated within hours of security forces killing two Lashkar-e-Taiba men in a separate operation at a nearby village, capping a relentless offensive against terror outfits since the May 3 Handwara encounter in which eight security personnel, including two Army officers – Colonel Ashutosh Sharma and Major Anuj Sood – were killed in action.

A bill that aims to promote sexual assault survivors’ rights and improve evidence collection and processing unanimously passed a Missouri House committee Wednesday.
 The House Children and Families Committee voted 13-0 in favor of SB 569, sponsored by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-Manchester. The bill has already made it through the Senate, where Koenig’s original text was combined with two other bills.
 It would give survivors access to a tracking system for sexual assault evidence, require all hospitals to offer forensic examinations and create a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights.
 The Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Missouri Hospital Association and the Joyful Heart Foundation, an organization that works against sexual assault and domestic violence, provided written testimony in support of the bill, with some caveats.
 Under the bill, all licensed hospitals would have to offer forensic exams for sexual assault survivors by Jan. 1, 2023, whether through employing a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner or qualified physician, or by using telehealth to allow a SANE to remotely direct exams.
 The Missouri Hospital Association objected to the telehealth provision. Committee Chair Rep. Sheila Solon, R-St. Joseph, said the group argued “getting patients to the right facility is more important than the closest facility.”
 She strongly disagrees with that reasoning.
 “A rape kit is not open heart surgery,” she said, and being sent to another hospital hours away can be retraumatizing for survivors. “They’re already in shock and traumatized and at the lowest point in their life, probably. And what we need to show them is compassion and help when they arrive.”
 Rep. Keri Ingle, D-Lee’s Summit, said she knew of a law enforcement officer who drove a survivor three hours after a closer hospital refused to perform an exam.
 Another section of the bill gives sexual assault survivors access to a tracking system for sexual assault evidence and requires that the Department of Public Safety work with the attorney general and with Health and Human Services to develop a temperature-controlled repository for evidence.
 “Nothing would be more traumatic than being a victim and then not knowing if your kit had even been tested,” Koenig said. “These (survivors) deserve justice.”
 When survivors decide not to participate in the criminal justice system, their evidence would be kept for five years, or five years after the survivor turns 18.
 Koenig said the bill might need adjustment in response to concerns. The Joyful Heart Foundation testimony said mandated evidence tracking was not in the best interest of survivors, Koenig told the committee, and the Missouri attorney general said it would be difficult to track all evidence instead of just rape kits.
 Solon argued that it is important to track all kinds of evidence and that the difficulties the attorney general brought up applied to the whole tracking system.
 “A lot of victims of a sexual assault take a shower because they feel dirty. And sometimes the only evidence that we have is their underwear or the jeans for the physical evidence. That evidence is just as important as a rape kit,” she said.
 “While we’re setting up a system, which is logistically going to be difficult for the attorney general to do, why don’t we do it the right way?” she added a few minutes later.
 SB 569 would also create a Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights.
 Some of those rights would include being able to consult with a rape crisis center employee or volunteer during forensic exams, having a support person present during interviews with law enforcement or attorneys, showering at no cost after a forensic exam and choosing the gender of the law enforcement officer who interviews them.
 The bill of rights also says medical providers and law enforcement must inform survivors of their rights, give them information about available resources and share the results of examinations.
 DPS would pay for forensic exams and make evidence-collection kits available.
 The bill isn’t automatically funded but rather depends on the budget committee to set aside money, Solon said, as well as allowing donations.
 While that makes her more comfortable supporting it in the current economic situation, it also means passing the bill is only the first step, Solon said.
 “I hope that when our economy recovers, that this is something that we do. When I’m out of the building, I hope the members of this committee will help push in the budget committee to appropriate for this,” she said.

_Editor’s note: The Teton Valley News will be honoring spring sports seniors. This week we start with baseball and softball (see page A13) and will follow with track, golf and rodeo in the coming weeks._
 Over the past 150 years, baseball has evolved into America’s “national pastime”, having been played as far back as the Civil War. Baseball gave us larger than life heroes in Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. It survived two world wars, producing superstar-turned-war-heroes like Bob Feller and Ted Williams, and was a leader in breaking down racial barriers with Jackie Robinson.
 The sport has never been devoid of controversy, but baseball has endured its many ups and downs. On the 17th of April, 2020, the IHSAA board announced that all spring sports in the state of Idaho were cancelled for the remainder of the school year. This directive came as a result of the safety parameters set by Idaho Gov. Brad Little. A season lost before it had even begun for athletes at Teton High School.

For the last two months, Missouri football has been put on hold. Spring practice was cut short a fifth of the way through due to COVID-19 and all athletics were stopped.
 But Tigers fans might be able to see a light at the end of the tunnel. The Missouri athletic department resumed operations Monday at the South End Zone Building in Memorial Stadium.Coach Eliah Drinkwitz and the football staff returned to their offices as part of a soft reopening for the campus.
 Other Southeastern Conference schools have started to make plans for the summer. Mississippi hopes to bring athletes to campus by July 1, while other universities are eyeing athletes returning in the summer as well.
 The only thing that is concrete is that the SEC has suspended all athletic activities until May 31. The conference’s other schools are making tentative plans for when athletic departments will be allowed to open back up again; many schools are setting June 1 as a target date.
 Missouri is planning for athletes to return June 1 if the conference lets schools open up then. If facilities are open, Missouri would require all football and men’s and women’s basketball players to be in Columbia, while attendance would be optional for athletes in other sports, per an athletic department spokesperson. The university is also paying student-athlete scholarships through the semester.
 Arkansas plans to open its workout facility for optional strength and conditioning training June 1, with football practices starting July 15 to give the team enough time to start the season Sept. 5. Most programs and athletic directors believe a mid-July start for practices would be needed for teams to start the season on time in early September.
 Razorbacks athletic director Hunter Yurachek stressed the timeline was just a plan and not a final decision in a tweet Monday. Missouri also said it didn’t have any information on what happens other than athletes returning if facilities are open after May 31, citing the lack of a firm decision by the conference.
 The NCAA controls dates for seasons and will be the main decider for who plays when, but member schools have a lot of power within the NCAA. University and conference administrators making up the board of governors that hire the NCAA president and university officials have spots on NCAA committees. If enough teams can play, then they could feasibly convince the NCAA not to delay its season even if not every school is ready to begin at the same time.
 The NCAA released a document Friday that gave its nine core principles for member schools to follow when bringing back athletics. Those principles state that state and local authorities must have a resocialization plan in place and that universities must have a resocialization plan for students and student- athletes to return to campus.

The team is applying for a provisional patent for their innovation.

A restricted number of customers has been implemented in businesses in the Smoky River region during the COVID-19 pandemic.      Restrictions were put in place by Marcel Maure, director of emergency management, for the Smoky River region.      “To be proactive, I went to businesses to discuss how to limit close interaction with people to stop the spread of COVID-19,” Maure says.      “If you can’t have gatherings of more than 15 people, why should we have more than 15 in a business?”      It will remain in effect until further notice.      Steps were taken to respond to the start of an outbreak at the Manoir du Lac in McLennan, which occurred in early April.      “Without more detailed data from Alberta Health Services, of where cases are located, we took measures to flatten the curve,” Maure says.      He says the aim of the business restriction is to comply with social distancing orders as people are required to be at least six feet apart.      At the top of the list, a maximum of 15 shoppers are permitted at one time in two grocery stores in Falher and one in McLennan, Maure says.      Smaller businesses are restricted to a number as low as two to three.      Business owners strongly supported the steps.      “They believe it a good thing, to help flatten the curve,” Maure says.      The order also permits only one person from a household inside a business at one time.      He says the measures were taken after he consulted the CAOs for the M.D. of Smoky River, the Town of Falher, the Town of McLennan, the Village of Donnelly and the Village of Giroux- ville.      All businesses are complying with the order, Maure says.      Smoky Region Emergency Services released an update April 15 on municipal websites.      “The Smoky River region, including the towns and villages within it, currently has a high number of active COVID-19 cases given the small population,” Maure says.      “This means community transmission is definitely possible.      “All persons need to continue to stay at home as much as possible, limit interaction with others and stay at least six feet away from other people.”

Some downtown businesses in Sturgis are going to be showcasing some senior student-athletes.
 Cari Cosby, who runs the Sturgis Gridiron Club, was out Tuesday afternoon hanging up vinyl profile signs for 36 seniors. The banners, which each showcase a student-athlete's name and sport they would have played this spring, are hanging up in local business windows downtown.
 "We are putting these in business windows downtown so the kids can see their faces somewhere," Cosby said from inside Five Lakes Coffee, one of the locations for the banners, on Tuesday afternoon.
 Cosby started the banners back during football season and thought it would be a good idea for this year's seniors, who had their athletic careers cut short because of COVID-19. Some of the senior moms got to talking, Cosby said, and Stephanie Smith, varsity competitive cheerleading coach, started contacting some businesses downtown to gauge their interest.
 "I think it's something nice so the kids can get some recognition, especially since their seasons were ended this way," Cosby said.
 The banners were done by Action Quick Print Plus in Sturgis, she said. The banners were paid for by a Facebook fundraiser Cosby started. This way, the athletes do not have to pay anything for the banners and they will get to keep them once they're taken down.
 Some of the businesses which will have Sturgis senior banners include Five Lakes, Designs by Vogt's, Jaclyn Nicole's Salon, Open Door Dallery, Corner Cafe, Sportsarama, Willer's Shoes, Edward Jones, T.C. Appliance and Mike's Pizza.
