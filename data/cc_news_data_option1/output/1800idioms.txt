"Just staying patient. Nobody really knows when we will return to racing, but there really is no off-season. When we aren't racing, we are working in the garage or building chassis or doing something with the cars to get them ready for the next race or the next season," he said. "It's been weird so far this year. Normally, we are passing out marketing material and asking anybody who wants to come on board as sponsors. We have a lot of sponsors that support us.

PLYMOUTH - For Plymouth South Baseball Head Coach Walter Fust, the coronavirus pandemic is a staunch reminder that participating in sports is, ultimately, a privilege. And, as the virus continues to wreak devastating havoc across the state, country and rest of the world, high school athletes in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are just a fraction of those affected.
 On April 21, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker announced the closure of all schools in the state. With this news, came the brutal reality for most spring sports athletes - their season was over.
 "This all resonates with the notion that you don't have to play baseball, you don't have to play sports," said Fust. "You get to do these things. Having the opportunity to do these things, as coaches and athletes, is something we're very lucky to be able to do."
 This year, Fust was looking forward to fielding a team that boasted 13 seniors: Robert Abruzzi, Maxwell Crockford, Connor Cyr, Robert Duseau, Joseph Frechette, Andrew Gecse, Anthony Luongo, Keven Paul, Niko Rigas, Chase Sacco, Evan Sherman, Nicholas Siegelman and Colby Stasiowski.
 The past two seasons, the Panthers saw multiple underclassmen start for the varsity squad which gave the Class of 2020 plenty of experience coming into the year. With all the shared playing time, this year's South seniors were fully jelled and ready to make a substantial run in the Patriot League.
 Senior co-captains Nick Siegelman and Joe Frechette, leaders at the helm, were more than ready to steer the ship.
 "Going into the fall and winter, we knew which kids had to put in work and what we had to do to get to where we wanted to be," said Siegelman. "I feel like we took those steps that we needed to take. It just stinks that we couldn't show it. We really wanted to compete for a league title and I feel like we had the pieces to do it."
 "It just stinks because we've been working so hard and building the team chemistry as best we can," added Frechette. "Just seeing it go down the drain like that is horrible. But, that's life and it was the right decision to make by the state to shut down all the schools."
 After the Baker administration announced the closure of all schools in the commonwealth for the remainder of the academic year, Fust knew an athletics cancellation would follow. Three days later, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) announced that all spring sports were canceled for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.
 Fust waited 24 hours to let everything sink in before he made an official statement to his team. At that time, he coordinated a video conference with players to discuss the latest news. As themes of disappointment and anger festered within the ballclub, Fust admits, he was persistent in keeping the mood positive.
 "They're going to use this as a tremendous learning experience going forward," said Fust. "As much as it's hard for them to accept right now, this is something they're going to draw on and learn from when they become teachers, coaches and parents themselves."
 Before the full cancellation of the spring sports season, the plan for the Plymouth South baseball regular season was to complete a "once-around" schedule against the other 11 Patriot League teams. At that time, with a sliver of hope remaining, Fust said that his team was still committed to certain home-workout regiments, with players practicing in their backyards and driveways.
 "They're handling it as best as they can," said Fust. "I think the thing with these kids is that, within the last six weeks or so, athletes across the entire state and the rest of the country have had to grow up a lot faster than should have to, dealing with this pandemic."
 While the Plymouth South baseball Class of 2020 was forced to miss out on their senior year, that didn't stop them from giving out positive advice to their younger teammates.
 "For all the younger guys, I'm just trying to tell them, 'Take advantage of everything. Take advantage of your next two or three seasons because you never know. You could get injured or you could get a world pandemic. You just never know,'" said Frechette. "And, they all took that message pretty well and I hope they take it with them through the next couple years of their career."
 "My main message to them, especially the younger kids, was for them to keep the brotherhood and culture alive," said Siegelman. "Not to let this one year keep them down. I want the senior leadership that we had to continue for them. I hope we put them on the right path to do that."
 For the time being, Massachusetts' residents are stagnant as the state's stay- at-home advisory remains in place. Now, with no baseball season taking place, Coach Fust sees this situation as a time for growth and self-betterment.
 "We're all going to be better people because of what's happening," said Fust. "What's happened to these kids is going to make them better people."

CARVER - After weeks of strategizing potential plans and setting target dates for getting the 2020 spring season underway, it was finally set in stone: the season, and the remainder of the academic year, would fall victim to the wide- spread impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "I was looking forward to a condensed season, and when we got the news, my first gut reaction was sadness for all the kids, especially the seniors," girls track and field coach Sean Carey said.
 When news about delaying the start of the season hit around early to mid- March, a condensed season was the best case scenario, but with so much about the virus unknown, the best course of action was to scrap it all together.
 "At first, like everyone, you had hope that this wasn't going to go on forever and we'd have a shortened season, but after two or three weeks, the way things were headed, and we hadn't even come close to coming back at the beginning of April, to be honest, the writing was on the wall," boys tennis coach Roger King said.
 The senior class has gone through a lot in recent weeks, like not having the opportunity to close out their high school lives at the physical school, but they will all have to live with the "what if" of thinking about their final season.
 The news hit hard for the softball team in particular because they felt like their stars would align ahead of highly anticipated team success. The team didn't have a senior a season ago and was slated to have six this year.
 "It should've been the best season yet. I was really looking forward to seeing how much noise we were going to make with everyone coming back. It was kind of a bummer. We were hoping to make some noise and make it further in the tournament," softball coach Tony Rota said, wishing he could have one more season with this current group of seniors. Olivia Camelo, Shay Martin, Jacey Ruzzano, Morgan Campbell, Beth Stagnitta, and Ari Hunter were set to do some damage this spring.
 Girls track was also looking forward to capping off its seniors' high school careers on the right note.
 "The kids knew we were going to have a great season. I know they were frustrated that they couldn't show what they could do. My heart burns for these kids. They put a lot of time and hard work into it and for this to happen to them, it's a tough pill to swallow," Carey said.
 Jordan Turner, Bella Asam, Charlotte McElroy, and Emma Simmons were ready to represent Carver on the track one last time, but now they won't have that chance. Carey was looking forward to what their senior seasons had in store.
 He continued, "Jordan is hands-down the best all-around track athlete Carver has ever had, and that's saying a lot because there have been a lot of strong girls. She was absolutely going to kill it this spring, no doubt. Bella Asam, she was really coming on strong at the end of the winter in the jumps, I could put Bella in any race and she would do very well. Charlotte, same thing, she was ready to break out for another great spring herself in the sprints, she really helps us out with the throws and the javelin. Emma is coming off a great basketball season and she always is the top javelin thrower in the league. I feel for Emma too. I was glad she was able to finish her basketball season. I know that's her love. They're going to be irreplaceable in the future."
 For boys tennis, King wanted to see how his team was going to shape up. He had a mix of new sign-ups and perennial players that he was expecting to see a lot of growth from.
 "It would've been Luke Gregory, Chase Carey was going to be in strong contention for the top player this year, the Diogenes twins - Alex and Ben would've had great years. Jacob Wilkins would've had, I think, a really good season. Just talking to the kids this week, hopefully if things start to lighten up, hopefully we'll be able to get together as a team and have a little bit of an outing. I would love to do something as a team within a month or two before they all go their separate ways for college and everything, if we can," King said.
 The virus has left every spring athlete feeling like they have some unfinished business. The 2020 season is abandoned for good reason. It's a somber time, the virus has affected everyone in some capacity. It's important that everyone stays healthy at this time, and leaving the 2020 spring season at bay is the best way to do that.

According to Anastopoulos, delivery apps are good for business because they help market the restaurant by making it a top choice on the app for those who may not have ordered from them before. There are disadvantages of working with third party apps such as the commissions that restaurants pay for services, which can hurt their revenue in the long run.
