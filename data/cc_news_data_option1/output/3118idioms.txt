Stephen said: “I’m normally so careful with midges, I have my long sleeves and a net but I got so drunk it all went out the window.
 “I don't normally drink as a rule but we decided to take a bottle of Jack Daniels with us.
 “My pals went to bed. They weren’t bothered about having a drink because they were so tired so I thought, right I will crack it open myself.
 "I finished off the bottle and at some point climbed into my tent in just my pants with the door open.
 But the next day the explorer woke up covered in red itchy bites after midges had feasted on him during the night.

As a business owner that displays at PRI and has for a decade, any increase in the cost to display makes my stomach turn, but if participation falls off, I don’t know that they’ll be able to reduce rates. I’d say they’ll be cranking them up. However, with those increased rates will be equally increased pressure on the trade shows to provide massive value to both exhibitors and attendees…and that’s something I can get on board with.

Anyway, I look for Pro Mod to steal the show, honestly. There’s just so much momentum there…it’s hard to overlook. I am a passionate Pro Stock fan; I love the nuances of Pro Stock racing, the unique challenges it presents, the hyper- competition, the manually-shifted transmissions and the many other things, but with it’s 250-plus mph trap speeds, five-second elapsed times and guardwall- to-guardwall unpredictability, Pro Mod has sizzle that few other classes do.

Right now, with all this stuff up in the air, it’s hard to do anything effectively. Plans are changing, schedules are changing, you spend a tremendous amount of time just contending with logistics - there’s hardly an opportunity to try to improve in any way. Especially considering that I don’t feel there’s any upside right now; there’s no real way to “win” in 2020 other than to survive and that’s what we need to be focused on right now.

Image Credit: Merrick MortonDavid Fincher's _The Social Network_ , destined to be in the thick of Oscar talk this year, dominated the box office this first weekend in October, taking in $23 million from 2,771 locations. The PG-13 rated movie depicting the controversial founding of Facebook was met with an almost completely positive response from critics, and now adds a B+ from audiences, according to exit pollster CinemaScore. While expectations had placed the film starring Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield in a zone similar to _The Departed_ , or around $27 million for its opening frame, the film's positive word of mouth should bolster its performance in coming weeks, when it can be expected to draw in more male and younger audiences and approach _The_ _Departed 's_ total domestic gross of $132 million.

But Newsom also faces pressure from the other direction — not only from conservative activists who mounted a “Let us work” billboard near his home — but also, indirectly, from people like Lorraine Salazar. The owner of three Mexican restaurants in the Fresno area, Salazar said she employed 170 people before the pandemic began. She furloughed 120 of them in March when stay-at- home orders forced her to switch to a take-out only format.

The other two new wide releases, horror films _Let Me In_ and _Case 39_ , did not connect nearly as well with moviegoers. _Let Me In_ , a new take on the Swedish film _Let the Right One In_ , scored brilliantly with critics, but opened to just $5.3 million, landing it in seventh place for the weekend. Audiences were less enthusiastic, giving the film directed by J.J. Abrams protege Matt Reeves ( _Cloverfield_ ), who recently met with Christopher Nolan about _Superman_ , a C+, according to CinemaScore. _Case 39_ , which stars real-life couple Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper and had sat on the shelf at Paramount for some time, was just a hair behind in eighth place, also with an estimated $5.3 million, and actually a better B- score from audiences, according to CinemaScore.

Massachusetts is among seven states that are entering formal talks with manufacturers with the goal of facilitating rapid point-of-care antigen tests that could more quickly detect COVID-19 outbreaks in workplaces, schools and congregate care settings.
 Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who announced the interstate testing compact Tuesday, negotiated the agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation in his final days as chairman of the National Governors Association. Plans call for each state to purchase 500,000 tests.
 "Increasing both testing capacity and access to testing is a critical part of stopping the spread of COVID-19," Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. "We are pleased to join this interstate compact and look forward to working with this bipartisan group of governors to collectively build on these shared goals."
 Earlier Tuesday, Baker told reporters that "one of the things we are working on developing is an ability to do some rapid mobile testing for schools once schools open." The governor did not elaborate on his intentions.
 The governors of Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia are also in the compact, and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced his intent to join Tuesday after the compact was initially announced with the release of a formal but nonbinding letter of intent.
 The states are in talks with Becton Dickinson and Quidel, the U.S. manufacturers of the antigen tests, to purchase more than 3 million total tests, which Hogan's office says can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes.
 In May, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 antigen test to Quidel Corporation. The FDA said the new category of diagnostic test could "quickly detect fragments of proteins found on or within the virus by testing samples collected from the nasal cavity using swabs."
 At the time, the agency said positive results from antigen tests were highly accurate, but cautioned that "there is a higher chance of false negatives, so negative results do not rule out infection." The agency also said it expected to authorize more antigen tests.
 According to Hogan's office, the purchasing agreement shows manufacturers there is demand to scale up production of the tests and the cooperative will help states to buy tests and supplies in a "sustainable and cost-effective manner."
 "With severe shortages and delays in testing and the federal administration attempting to cut funding for testing, the states are banding together to acquire millions of faster tests to help save lives and slow the spread of COVID-19," Hogan said. "I want to thank my fellow governors for signing on to this groundbreaking bipartisan agreement, which we have just finalized after weeks of discussions with the Rockefeller Foundation. We will be working to bring additional states, cities, and local governments on board as this initiative moves forward."
