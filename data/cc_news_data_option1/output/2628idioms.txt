And what we saw was before the stay at home order is we saw an increasing slope of $35 new cases per day. Right after we implanted the stay at home order, we started seeing that decline almost immediately. We got ahead of the curve and we're seeing a declining slope of 14 cases a day.

Yes, the PDP is an opposition party. You know in a Presidential democracy, you don’t have opposition parties. What you have is minority parties. And so, the minority can have their say, but the majority will have their way. So, we are overwhelmed in terms of numbers. When we look at issues that will impact positively on the country, of course, we support. Take the issue of the loan, for instance. Given the global economic contraction, there’s no country that is not borrowing. America which has the healthiest economy in the world has borrowed the most. So, yes borrowing down the road becomes a problem because generations yet unborn are going to confront it. But then, if we die now, there will be no generation for tomorrow. So, borrowing, provided it is applied judiciously can pay back itself. It is when it is misapplied or misappropriated that it becomes a problem. So, we approved the loan not because we are rubber stamp, but because if you look at our economy, if we don’t borrow what will happen. And so I think that it doesn’t make us rubber stamp; we are just facing the reality of our current situation.

Blurb: Plans to spend ₹1.5 crore on connecting three water reservoirs of the plant with the city's main waterworks station
 BATHINDA Notwithstanding a strong political opposition against the state government's announcement of closing down Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDTP), the Bathinda municipal corporation has prepared a blueprint to use assets of the defunct power project.
 According to the plan chalked out by the local body, a sum of ₹1.5 crore will be spent to connect three large water reservoirs of GNDTP with the main waterworks station near Joggers Park here.
 The three man-made water bodies, spread over 164 acres, previously part of the power generation process, are now tipped to be used for additional storage of canal water for supply to the city households.
   
   
 Bathinda depends upon water supply from Bathinda branch of Sirhind canal. Municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill on Sunday said the proposal to use lakes will be beneficial for the city.
 "As per the plan, water from the defunct power facility lakes will be flown to the waterworks site through a pipe. If needed, water treatment will be installed at these lakes for better supply management," said the official.
 Ever since the government announced to put a curtain on the power plant that was established in 1974, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), employees of state power department and various factions of Bhartiya Kisan Unions have been protesting against the decision. They demand the revival of the facility.
 Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who also represents Bathinda (urban) assembly segment, has invited political wrath for backtracking on his pre-poll stand of reviving the plant.
 For a population estimated 3.5 lakh, Bathinda has 53,510 registered water subscribers. Sources say GNDTP's lakes have a water holding capacity of 500MGD and it will be beneficial in the long term.
 Officials say when the canal is closed for maintenance for 20-days each before sowing of kharif and rabi crops, water supply time gets half to two hours in a day.
 Former SAD legislator from Bathinda Sarup Chand Singla said the city had never witnessed a crisis-like situation and the existing public water system has enough capacity to meet the demand.
 "Manpreet is trying to deviate public attention from the closure of power plant and plan to dismantle chimneys which are a landmark of development of the neglected part of south Malwa," he said.

And yet even after signing up for several apps, 39-year-old Saori Okawa still wasn't making as much money delivering meals and groceries as she did driving for ride-hailing giant Uber before the pandemic struck. “I started to juggle three apps to make ends meet,” said Okawa, who recently reduced her work hours after receiving unemployment benefits. “It was really hard, because at that time, I could not afford to stay home because I had to pay rent.” Okawa is one of an estimated 1.5 million so-called gig workers who make a living driving people to airports, picking out produce at grocery stores or providing childcare for working parents. Theirs had already been a precarious situation, largely without safeguards such as minimum wage, unemployment insurance, workers compensation and health and safety protections. But with the pandemic pummeling the global economy and U.S. unemployment reaching heights not seen since the Great Depression, gig workers are clamoring for jobs that often pay less while facing stiff competition from a crush of newly unemployed workers also attempting to patch together a livelihood - all while trying to avoid contracting the coronavirus themselves.

It has been said that the world will end not with a bang but a whimper. That is sort of the way Alabama's recreational red snapper season ends.
   
 Originally set to run May 22-July 19, the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources announced that it would come to an end July 3, meaning it won't be open for anglers with private boats on the busiest tourism weekend of the year. Charter boats will continue to be allowed to sortie into the Gulf for red snapper and commercial fishermen operate on a different set of rules.
   
 The state is doing what it promised to do. It asked for more control over managing the snapper stocks off its coast. In return, it had to promise to monitor the recreational catch and when the state reached the quota allotted it for recreational fishing, the state would close the season.
   
 The early closing is actually the result of some good fortune. The weather was very good this year, allowing anglers to get out and fish the four-day weekends the season was open. According to DCNR officials, only the weekend that a tropical storm hit was too rough to fish.
   
 Also, the fish have continued to get bigger. Because the quota is measured in pounds, bigger fish mean the state reaches its quota sooner. Since one of the aims was to improve the overall size of the snapper stock, it indicates conservation efforts are working.
   
 Yet it doesn't seem quite fair to the people who have invested in boats and equipment, particularly those who planned a late season trip. People who couldn't fish in May and June won't have the opportunity at all.
   
 I've seen red snapper fishing change a great deal in my lifetime. My father told me about going out on a commercial snapper boat in the 1920s or '30s. The fish were caught on hand lines and there was no refrigeration on board. The boat's hold was like a giant live well. Many fish died and were discarded as waste.
   
 My father described those fish as large. But by the time I was a teenager and first went out on a snapper "head boat" out of Panama City, Fla., the fish we caught were only 7-9 inches long, about the size of "keeper" crappie. There was no limit and the fishery was obviously getting overfished.
   
 By the time I started spending more time at the coast pursuing saltwater fish in the early part of this century, there was a limit and a season. I thought it was pretty restrictive at the time, six months and four fish per day. Now it would be viewed as outrageously liberal.
   
 Fifteen years ago, catching a limit of snapper often mean culling a lot of undersized fish. At certain times in heavily fished areas, it seemed if the entire ocean was filled with 15 ½ inch fish. That was a half inch below the length limit.
   
 We had to resort to all kinds of sneaky tricks, like "butterflying" whole cigar minnows and hiding a trailer hook in the bait, to catch keepers. In recent years, I've caught large snapper on rigs with wire leaders that I'd put out king mackerel. That is something you'd never see 15 years ago.
   
 Today, according to the reports I get, the biggest complaint is that the day is over too quickly. Every angler gets his two-fish limit quickly and there is no problem with length.
   
 It wouldn't hurt saltwater fishermen to adapt to the current environment. There are other fish in the Gulf that provide plenty of sport. Some people suggest catch and release fishing for snapper but I generally advise against it. Pulling snapper up from the depths can stress the fish at best and kill them at worst.
   
 Every indicator seems to point to the fact that conservation efforts have been successful. Recreational anglers have been at the forefront of those efforts, providing artificial fish habitat and money for research. The state recognizes that and has always been an advocate for recreational anglers. The federal government is a tough sell.
   
 But at some point, recreational anglers deserve to be rewarded for their sacrifices and conservation efforts with a season that won't be snatched out from under them without warning.

In the United States, “there are a lot of voices clamoring to open up or it will cost us the economy, since there are millions of Americans that need to work to put food on the table,” he said. “So Americans were willing to take chances that Europeans did not have to.”
 A lot will depend now on the course of the pandemic.
 No doubt, Europeans continue to argue fiercely over the size and shape of their coronavirus recovery fund and how it will be distributed, but by now there is no doubt that the money will be in the pipeline.
 If Europe is lucky and can engineer a broad, comprehensive lockdown but a short one, then whenever that money arrives next year will help the economy grow, especially if recovery is slow, weak and prolonged.
 Last week, Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, which stepped in with a massive program to guarantee new government debt, said: “We probably have passed the lowest point,” but given all the unknowns, “I say that with some trepidation.”
 In the United States, on the other hand, the uncertainty of the government response is itself a factor. “Despite being one country,” Reichlin said, “the U.S. is coming out much more fragmented than Europe.”
 If American consumers remain apprehensive, or their unemployment benefits run out, or if there is a continued rise in illnesses or a second coronavirus wave, the U.S. recovery could be short-circuited.
 “We live with the idea that the U.S. has an ability to rebound that is almost unlimited,” Michel Duclos, a former French ambassador, told The Atlantic. “For the first time, I’m starting to have some doubts.”

BROCKTON -- When she was assigned to a New York City hospital as a travel nurse late last year, Alycia Daley never imagined she'd find herself in the epicenter of a global pandemic ravaging hospitals around the world.
 But as health care centers in the city became overwhelmed with coronavirus patients, Daley said it got so bad the staff were worried for their own safety as they watched colleagues get sick. She even assigned one of her coworkers as her health care proxy in the event she tested positive and took a turn for the worse.
 "I never thought I'd be doing that at 30," she said.
 Now back in Brockton after cases in New York City have declined and taking time off before she volunteers to go help other hospitals seeing an uptick in cases, Daley described what she witnessed as "horrific" and expressed fear that a second wave of the coronavirus could cause a spiral in Massachusetts and elsewhere in the country.
 "Some people feel like the news is hyping it up, but I say, being in New York, it was way worse than what they were releasing," she said. "When it hits, and it hits bad, people around you get sick who have taken precautions -- they know what to do."
 Daley first landed in New York in October through her company, Aya Healthcare, that sends nurses on temporary placements around the world where short-term staff is needed. As an oncology RN, she was assigned to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center helping long-term cancer patients.
 She was only supposed to stay for about three months, she said, but once the hospital caught wind of the news about the emergence of the coronavirus in China, they extended her contract. During the first few months she was there, Daley said she would travel back to Brockton once a month when she had a few days off in a row to work per diem at Good Samaritan Medical Center.
 Upon returning to New York the week of March 20, she saw coronavirus cases explode in the city, not knowing then that her previous trip to Brockton would be the last time she would return home for months.
 "When I went back (to New York), that's when it really hit," she said. "That's when they declared it was a pandemic and the state of emergency for everyone to shelter in place. It was like every day, it was changing."
 It was then that she entered "survival mode," she said, where every day seemed to see another floor of COVID-19 patients as New York City turned into a "ghost town."
 "At one point, we had almost 16 floors and four ICUs, just COVID-19," she said. "... All of the hospitals kind of came together at one point. We were sharing supplies and sharing patients just because patients were dying in the emergency room before they even got seen. It was just too many people that were sick."
 Given the novelty of the virus and uncertainty about how it worked, Daley said they were learning more about the symptoms of the virus and how it spread through staff that got sick, who reported a loss of a sense of smell, months before it was identified as a symptom.
 "A lot of patients and people that got it didn't have a sore throat," she said. "They had chest pain, chest tightness. That's when we found out people were asymptomatic. We were testing patients every 72 hours and they were testing negative, and then all of a sudden testing positive."
 And while she said she saw a lot of older patients respond well to treatment in the beginning, she also saw younger patients under the age of 50 with no preexisting conditions get extremely sick.
 "People were coming in normal and walking fine, and then ending up on ventilators in a matter of hours," she said. "It was scary, because you didn't know why it was happening, especially back then."
 The unknowns of the virus sparked fear in the hospital staff, with Daley saying she was afraid to leave her apartment except to go to work and do essential errands like grocery shopping.
 "You're scared and nervous of yourself catching it," she said. "...We were just scared but trying to do the best we could and remain safe."
 Shortly after celebrating her 31st birthday in New York on May 20, where she worked a 13 1/2 hour shift, the number of cases declined enough -- down to one floor for COVID-19 patients and one ICU -- for her to return to Brockton.
 She tested negative for both the virus and antibodies upon her return, but her experience has led her to take a break before she plans to use her experience with coronavirus cases to help other hospitals with a surge of cases starting in August.
 "That's why I'm taking the two months off and I am talking to a counselor, just about the PTSD because I was having nightmares when I first came back," she said. "It's scary. It's really scary. It's nothing you could imagine. Being in New York during that time, it's really something I feel like you had to be there."
 After her experience, Daley stressed the importance of wearing masks, washing hands and sanitizing frequently, maintaining social distancing and limiting contact with other people to make contact tracing easier in the event of a positive test result -- mainly acting as if you were infectious around your loved ones, she said.
 "We showed in New York that you can make the numbers go down if you do this stuff," she said. "It works. I saw the floors get less full, I saw that it was true -- we were having less people who were sick, less people with symptoms, less people on ventilators."
 And even if people don't believe that wearing masks or other suggested methods to prevent transmission of the virus work, she asked: What could it hurt if it makes someone feel better, especially with the potential to save even one life?
 "The more time passes, the more we can learn," she said. "... I feel like we will eventually find a treatment for it, but the longer we have, the better. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but just remain diligent and that's what I would tell my neighbors and loved ones and I would tell other people. Because it works -- it's been proven."

The main point was to get money into the system so it did not shut down entirely, so consumer demand would continue. But the Treasury ended up giving a lot to those who did not need it — including to many dead people — and on a first-come, first-serve basis to employers, some of whom did not need the help.
 But even that huge spending, largely targeted at individuals rather than employers, did not prevent massive layoffs. Washington is relying on unemployment insurance and increased those payments by $600 a week, but that runs out at the end of July. Without any certainty about what comes next, consumers will hesitate to spend, slowing any recovery.
 The rise in unemployment in America has been roughly five times that in France, Pisani-Ferry wrote in a paper with Jérémie Cohen-Setton. “As an immediate crisis response, the French (and European) approach undoubtedly offered a bigger bang for the buck.”

TRAVERSE CITY — Mask-wearing can stop COVID-19's spread, but not everyone in Traverse City is wearing them in public.
 That's prompted calls for the city to adopt an ordinance requiring face masks in public places, something city commissioners will discuss Monday. While some leaders are willing to consider it, they're not sure how much good it'll do.
 Commissioner Roger Putman said he sympathizes with business owners who have to deal with rude customers who refuse to wear masks. But an ordinance, or even just an official recommendation, is likely to fall on deaf ears for some.
 Mayor Pro Tem Amy Shamroe said she does believe an ordinance could lead more people to wear masks if violators are fined.
 "There's always going to be some people who are going to be defiant over it, because they've made this political for some reason instead of the public health crisis that it is," she said.
 She believes the Fourth of July weekend will be a major test for how people behave in Traverse City businesses after Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer closed downstate bars to in-person service Thursday.
 Shamroe pointed out that if commissioners agree to an ordinance, it won't be coming Monday; city staff would have to draft one later, and city Attorney Lauren Trible-Laucht would have to review it.
 Commissioner Brian McGillivary said he's interested in discussing the idea but wants to know who would enforce it, and if the city has the authority to require masks.
 Adopting an ordinance sends the message that the city is serious about mask- wearing, McGillivary said. But he has no idea if it'll make a difference.

E’ accaduto ieri notte poco prima delle 23,30 quando una pattuglia della stazione di Castellarano, nel corso di un posto di controllo eseguito in località Roteglia, intimava l’alt di Polizia a un motociclo che scendeva in direzione Sassuolo. Il conducente alla vista della paletta aumentava la velocità, e forzando il posto di blocco si dava alla fuga. Nasceva un concitato inseguimento a folle velocità che si protraeva sino all’abitato di Sassuolo dove il centauro imboccava i vicoli del centro storico con l’intento di seminare i carabinieri che li stavano alle calcagna. Visto che i militari non mollavano la prese il malvivente ha deciso di abbandonare la moto a terra proseguendo a piedi la fuga e riuscendo a dileguarsi, agevolato dal buio della notte. Sul posto confluivano altre pattuglie dei carabinieri che scatenavano una vera e propria caccia al malvivente. La moto, come detto una Kawasaki 650, è risultata rubata a Cento durante un furto in abitazione lo scorso 30 giugno. Presto verrà restituita al derubato.

At a time when many of Corsicana’s businesses face financial devastation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Lynda Housley reports that her State Farm office is here to stay. On June 1, she celebrated 40 years in business.
 State Farm has offices nationwide and in Canada. It offers insurance coverage for everything from homes and automobiles, to businesses, health and life, pets and possessions, and also financial planning. Housley credits her success to strong name recognition and a lot of hard work.
 “The Texas market is volatile at times due to the large size of the state with lots of weather issues,” she said. “We keep learning to adapt and move through.”
 Housley and her husband, Dr. Harold Housley, VP of Institutional Advancement & Operations at Navarro College, moved from Florida to Corsicana in 1978. Her husband initially worked for Wolf Brand Products.
 Housley sought employment as a social worker, but with no viable options, she was offered a position as secretary for a local State Farm Agency. After two years, she was invited to attend the two-year State Farm Agent training program.
 With a three and a half-year-old daughter, Melissa, and 16-month-old son, Hal, she started the rigorous program. Currently, her daughter Melissa, also an agent, is the Office Manager as a part of the three employee team.
 “I started the business with no clients and built from the ground up,” she said. The way we do business now is a lot different. We used to inspect every home, but now it’s done virtually with venders. We did a lot more outside the office. I still try to do that. I like to know the people we insure. That’s how you meet people and build a business."
 When COVID-19 hit, her office was prepared to mobilize for the safety of her staff and the community. Five years ago, the State Farm headquarters launched a huge modernization effort to better utilize technology to streamline services.
 “We have the long-term interests of our customers at heart,” Housley said. “During COVID-19, we are doing a lot more by phone and with electronics without the face to face contact. We have not missed a day. Our clients know we are here. We are essential, and business is booming. We proved that the business can do well even with working in a different way.”
 Housley reports a shift in the products most requested by customers.
 “Auto and homeowners insurance is our bread and butter,” she said. But Housley said she thinks the pandemic has shifted people’s thinking about the future.

There's clearly a huge difference between an English Premier League match and one played between friends on a local field. But when you take away 54,000 fans who would otherwise be singing and cheering at Liverpool's Anfield, both sound the same. That doesn't seem appropriate to Pierre Moossa, NBC's coordinating producer for Premier League coverage. He is one of those who have embraced adding crowd noise to telecasts with games being played in empty stadiums due to the coronavirus pandemic. “All the different sports are trying to find ways to cover the game behind closed doors, but as you get down to it, certain sports are more tied or associated with certain experiences than others,” Moossa said. “It did surprise me how much something that is not natural to the game itself, meaning that it’s being enhanced, would make such a difference to the viewing experience.” With leagues that already have returned using crowd audio, it is likely it also will be used in some form when Major League Baseball, the NBA, the NHL and the NFL resume. Those leagues have said they are evaluating options, but nothing has been finalized. Los Angeles Angels manager Joe Maddon said he would be for some sort of noise in ballparks during games. “I would not be opposed to it because it would be weird to listen to broadcast from behind home plate. You don’t want everyone to hear everything you are saying all the time,” he said. “You have to be mindful of that and have some kind of white noise to prevent writing down the conversations.” Before the Premier League returned last month, Moossa was all for authenticity. That is until he watched a game with natural sound and compared it to watching guys playing in a park. Others have said matches felt flat because the only sounds were the ball being kicked, the referee's whistle...

Blurb: Plans to spend ₹1.5 crore on connecting three water reservoirs of the plant with the city's main waterworks station
 BATHINDA Notwithstanding a strong political opposition against the state government's announcement of closing down Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDTP), the Bathinda municipal corporation has prepared a blueprint to use assets of the defunct power project.
 According to the plan chalked out by the local body, a sum of ₹1.5 crore will be spent to connect three large water reservoirs of GNDTP with the main waterworks station near Joggers Park here.
 The three man-made water bodies, spread over 164 acres, previously part of the power generation process, are now tipped to be used for additional storage of canal water for supply to the city households.
 Bathinda depends upon water supply from Bathinda branch of Sirhind canal. Municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill on Sunday said the proposal to use lakes will be beneficial for the city.
 "As per the plan, water from the defunct power facility lakes will be flown to the waterworks site through a pipe. If needed, water treatment will be installed at these lakes for better supply management," said the official.
 Ever since the government announced to put a curtain on the power plant that was established in 1974, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), employees of state power department and various factions of Bhartiya Kisan Unions have been protesting against the decision. They demand the revival of the facility.
 Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who also represents Bathinda (urban) assembly segment, has invited political wrath for backtracking on his pre-poll stand of reviving the plant.
 For a population estimated 3.5 lakh, Bathinda has 53,510 registered water subscribers. Sources say GNDTP's lakes have a water holding capacity of 500MGD and it will be beneficial in the long term.
 Officials say when the canal is closed for maintenance for 20-days each before sowing of kharif and rabi crops, water supply time gets half to two hours in a day.
 Former SAD legislator from Bathinda Sarup Chand Singla said the city had never witnessed a crisis-like situation and the existing public water system has enough capacity to meet the demand.
 "Manpreet is trying to deviate public attention from the closure of power plant and plan to dismantle chimneys which are a landmark of development of the neglected part of south Malwa," he said.

NEW YORK (AP) — There were the two-hour, unpaid waits outside supermarkets when San Francisco first started to lock down, on top of the heavy shopping bags that had to be lugged up countless flights of stairs.
 And yet even after signing up for several apps, 39-year-old Saori Okawa still wasn't making as much money delivering meals and groceries as she did driving for ride-hailing giant Uber before the pandemic struck.
 “I started to juggle three apps to make ends meet,” said Okawa, who recently reduced her work hours after receiving unemployment benefits. “It was really hard, because at that time, I could not afford to stay home because I had to pay rent.”
 Okawa is one of an estimated 1.5 million so-called gig workers who make a living driving people to airports, picking out produce at grocery stores or providing childcare for working parents. Theirs had already been a precarious situation, largely without safeguards such as minimum wage, unemployment insurance, workers compensation and health and safety protections.
 But with the pandemic pummeling the global economy and U.S. unemployment reaching heights not seen since the Great Depression, gig workers are clamoring for jobs that often pay less while facing stiff competition from a crush of newly unemployed workers also attempting to patch together a livelihood - all while trying to avoid contracting the coronavirus themselves.
 U.S. unemployment fell to 11.1% in June, a Depression-era level that, while lower than last month, could worsen after a surge in coronavirus cases has led states to close restaurants and bars.

Julien Bernard (Trek Segafredo) came away with a win on stage 2 of the Virtual Tour de France. The Frenchman left it late, coming around Freddy Ovett (Israel Start-Up Nation) and Michael Woods (EF). It looked as though Ovett had the win in the bag but he was caught just before the line by Bernard after the Frenchman used a late power-up.
 Patrick Bevan (CCC Team) had attacked in the final 600m but he was brought back just before the sprint opened up. NTT kept their lead in the race and will wear the maillot jaune next weekend for stage 3. NTT also maintained their lead in the points competition, with Mitchelton-Scott in second place.

“People don’t seem fearful. I think they have had more time to assess their financial and life needs. We’ve had a lot of people changing beneficiaries. They bought policies and put it in a drawer, and now they’ve had time to think about it."
 She reports more people are buying life insurance and policies for homes and cars have also increased
 “Loan and mortgage rates are low, and people are buying, and we are insuring,” Housley said.
 The one area she wishes people would consider more is disability insurance.
 “It is usually the last thing people think about. They think they are more likely to die before they become disabled, but it’s the opposite.”
 Housley notes that both her business and Corsicana have changed significantly over the last forty years.
 “It’s taken a while. When I started, there was only one other female who worked in insurance, and she was in her 70’s,” said Housley. “It was a man’s world back then. All that has changed.
 We came in 1978, and the town was calm and not as progressive. But now, our little town with the big streets is so quaint and becoming more modern. There are tremendous opportunities in a small town where people know each other and go to the same church. Corsicana is a good place to raise a family.”
 When asked about any regrets in the way she’s run her business, Housley said, “I don’t think so. One of the things that got us off to a solid start is we had a two-year training program. At the end of that time, we bought a lot and built a building of our own. That helped people know that we were here to stay and committed to make a go of it."
 Housley’s roots as a Corsicana small business appear firmly planted, “I have no retirement plans. I love what I do, and it’s more fun than work.”
 Her office is located at 1000 W. Second Ave., in Corsicana. She can be reached at 903-872-8444.
