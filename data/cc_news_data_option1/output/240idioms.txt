TAUNTON - It's not for nothing that Eileen Mann is promoting an American Red Cross blood drive at Taunton's Lafayette Club later this month.
 The Taunton mother of two learned the hard way just how vital an ample supply of blood can be to surgeons in a burn unit.
 Mann suffered third-degree burns to both hands, second-degree burns to her face and third-degree burns to her right leg on Saturday, Nov. 2.
 She required skin-graft surgery on her badly burned and swollen hands and spent 15 days recuperating in the Sumner R. Redstone Burn Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, the first three of which were in its surgical intensive care unit.
 The injuries were the result of an early evening accident in New Hampshire involving a backyard bonfire and a nearly empty five-gallon gas can.
 She and her husband, Jim, who own and operate a demolition derby business called Woodbooger Demolition Derby, were hanging out after a demolition event with a dozen or so friends behind the couple's second home in the small town of Washington.
 Mann says her husband had just finished doing something that she now realizes far too many people do when they want to kick start a campfire, bonfire or barbecue grill.
 "He foolishly put gasoline on the fire," she said, during an interview at the couple's Madison Street home.
 Mann, 52, says when Jim poured the gasoline on the fire, it achieved the desired effect with no adverse results. It was only after she took the can from his hand that events snowballed.
 Eileen says she intended to return the can, which by then contained just a small amount of gas, to the garage and even made a joke.
 "I shook the can and said, 'Don't do this at home.'"
 At that instant, Eileen said, the flame from the fire near her feet leapt into the air, entered the can's nozzle and ignited the fumes and liquid still in the metal container.
 "The can flashed," she said.
 Nearly instantaneously, it exploded.
 "It sounded like two sticks of dynamite. The fact that we're not deaf is amazing," Eileen said.
 She said it's ironic that if the can had been full or near full of gasoline it probably wouldn't have exploded.
 "But the pressure of the fumes had built up," Mann said, which created a perfect scenario for ignition.
 The night was cool and she had been wearing gloves, cotton pants and a hooded sweatshirt.
 Her next realization was that her hands, arms, leg and head were on fire.
 Eileen remembers reflexively shouting "Stop, drop and roll!" and dropping to the ground.
 Her husband then grabbed her and tried smothering the flames with his jacket.
 "We both rolled," she said.
 Eileen says she felt heat mainly on her face -- which was burned, although not nearly as badly as her hands -- but otherwise had a sensation of coldness as result of the shock.
 When she got to her feet, Jim ripped off her shirt. She says both her pants and hair had "melted."
 "It was so fast. It was over in an instance," Eileen said.
 During his effort to save his wife, Jim, 63, sustained serious burns to his left wrist and leg. He later underwent skin-graft surgery at Mass. General and was discharged the same day as his wife. He's due for another skin graft in March.
 Eileen says she heard people shouting "Call 911!"
 "But I said, 'No, get the car.'"
 She said the nearest hospital, Cheshire Medical Center in Keene, was a 17-mile drive. In addition, she said, the dirt road from her house to the main Route 10 is four miles long.
 Eileen got into the front passenger seat of the family's SUV with Jim in the backseat and eldest daughter Emily, who is 16, behind the wheel.
 "If we had waited for an ambulance, I probably would have died," she said.
 When they reached the end of the dirt road, she said, Jim switched places with his daughter and drove the rest of the way to the hospital. The entire trip took 20 minutes.
 At one point, Eileen said, they spotted a police officer parked on the side of the road. Jim pulled over to explain why he was driving so fast, and the officer then followed them with his lights flashing.
 The emergency staff at the Keene hospital had been alerted and were awaiting the arrival of the Manns.
 "I got out of the car. They told me not to walk and put me on the gurney. I could hear them say to call MedFlight," she said, referring to the Boston MedFlight emergency medical helicopter service.
 While still at the Keene emergency department, Eileen said that a staff member cut off her wedding ring from her badly swollen finger.
 "I had just gotten it resized at Pacheco's," she said with a smile, referring to Pacheco's Jewelry and Gifts in Taunton.
 She faded into unconsciousness as the pain medicine took effect, and she has no memory of the helicopter ride to Boston.
 In the meantime, her husband drove himself and his daughter to Mass. General, where he was admitted for treatment.
 Eileen says she awoke a day and a half later with her hands heavily bandaged as result of the skin grafts. Shortly thereafter, she said, she began a regimen of occupational therapy to ensure that she can walk on her own.
 One of the nurses told her that her own husband has also poured gasoline on outdoor fires. Another nurse, Eileen said, let her know there was the possibility of never regaining the use of her hands.
 The Manns were both big supporters of Mayor Shaunna O'Connell in her run to become Taunton's first female mayor.
 Mann said on Nov. 5, when she woke up in the hospital on Election Day, she exclaimed to her husband that "Shaunna better win that [expletive] election!"
 She'd been planning a run to fill the 3rd Bristol House seat vacated by O'Connell but that the accident scuttled any such endeavor.
 The Manns said after they returned home, the support from friends and well- wishers was overwhelming.
 "It looked like a funeral home," Eileen joked, describing the abundance of flowers dropped off at the house.
 Eileen said she's undergone laser treatment to help loosen the skin that was grafted from her stomach to her hands and will have more of those treatments. And she has an appointment this coming week to have the stitches removed.
 Her right pinky finger is badly curled, and she said only time will tell if she's able to straighten it out. But she is more than able to type on her laptop's keyboard.
 The Manns give high marks to the Mass. General doctors and nurses who took care of them.
 "It's like a well-oiled machine," Jim said. "Anywhere else in the world, and one or both of us would be dead."
 They also urge others not to use gasoline as an accelerant for outdoor fires and cookouts.
 The Jan. 31 blood drive at the Lafayette Club, located at 18 Lakeview Ave. will be from 2 to 7 p.m. To schedule an appointment, either call 1-800-REDCROSS or visit RedCrossBlood.org and enter MannFamily.

Four species of tree squirrels reside in Ohio, and all have their charms.
   
 The smallest and least known is the southern flying squirrel. It is common but seldom seen because of its strictly nocturnal habits.
   
 Slightly bigger is the red squirrel, which occurs statewide but is more localized than other squirrels. It has a distinct preference for coniferous trees.
   
 Most common is the well-known eastern gray squirrel, the typical squirrel of parks and suburbia in this area. Those who feed backyard birds wage war with this mammal. The squirrels often win.
   
 Then there is the largest squirrel of all, the gorgeous eastern fox squirrel. A whopper can weigh 3 pounds and stretch 3 feet or more from nose to outstretched tail tip. If there were a beauty pageant for squirrels, this one might wear the tiara.
   
 They are foxy indeed, with underparts tinted in showy burnt-orange. The upper pelage is a lovely grayish-black.
   
 From my experience, gray squirrels far outnumber foxes in Columbus and its neighborhoods. The latter becomes more common in rural areas.
   
 I recently moved to Worthington, an area I have long been acquainted with. Gray squirrels are abundant, but I have never seen a fox squirrel in my neighborhood -- until Jan. 9.
   
 That morning, I glanced out a back window to see a huge black squirrel sitting prominently on an open snag. It was as if it was posing for me. I usually keep a camera with a big telephoto lens at the ready, in case something bizarre appears at the feeders. Photographic prep paid dividends in this case.
   
 Not only did I document the yard's first fox squirrel, but it also was a rare melanistic morph, or form. My first thought was that it was a melanistic gray squirrel, but the massive size and tinges of orange bleeding through on the animal's underside gave it away.
   
 Black forms are far more common in gray squirrels, and in some parts of Columbus such animals are local celebrities. Melanin-enhanced fox squirrels seem to be virtually unknown, at least in Ohio. I have many biologically literate friends, and not one has said they have seen a black fox squirrel.
   
 Melanistic fox squirrels are known to occur, just in far fewer numbers than grays. Most black fox squirrels appear in the southern reaches of the range, which spans the eastern half of the U.S. Conversely, melanism in gray squirrels is more prolific in the northern parts of its distribution.
   
 Although the genetic mechanisms that produce melanism in squirrels is well- understood, the role of environmental factors that favor melanism, and possible gene flow between fox and gray squirrels, is lesser known.
   
 I have not seen the dusky fox squirrel since the day I discovered it. Maybe it's the vanguard of a wave to come, or it was a flash in the pan. Such animals would certainly enrich our squirrel diversity, that's for sure.

She delivered a committed, delightful performance in the schlocky “The Boy Next Door” (2015), which targeted Latinx audiences by hiring “Step Up” breakout Ryan Guzman, a process she was deeply involved with, according to casting director Nancy Nayor.

Later this year, the state’s new Maternal Mortality Review Committee will hold its first official meeting to analyze maternal deaths and try to figure out how to prevent more such deaths in the future.
 “It may change what we think about maternal mortality,” said Colleen Winter, division director for family and community health at the South Dakota Department of Health.
 No single cause has been pegged as the reason for America’s rising rates of maternal death and severe pregnancy complications. But the trend has coincided with rising health care costs as well as rising rates of chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes. The average age of women giving birth has risen, too. And, until this year, there really wasn’t a standard for how hospitals were expected to identify, treat and train for responding to severe pregnancy complications.

Arriving 15 minutes in, she whips around to introduce her glammed face in close-up — the kind of entrance only a dazzling dignitary can make. Lopez has the swagger to play a gangster type, but “Gigli” channels it through scenes as overcooked as the sensual vagina monologue that she spouts while doing yoga. Still, she runs circles around Affleck, always sure how long to pause before nailing a punchy line or when to arch her back to elicit a laugh.

WORCESTER -- Jon Grafton, 74, of Lancaster has a long history of anxiety and stress. He said that those conditions were negatively impacting his physical health -- to the point a few months ago when he was feeling "desperate" and "almost ready to give up."
 His wife, Andrea, added that their primary care physician gave them a list of behavioral health therapists and facilities to contact, but they discovered that there was a three-month wait for an appointment.
 That's why the couple thought it was "fabulous," when they learned that Reliant Medical Group would offer behavioral health services at the same place in Leominster where they have received physical care for more than 20 years.
 "We were excited about the convenience of it," Mrs. Grafton said.
 Reliant Medical Group is committed to integrating these two parts of health care and treating the whole person, according to Dr. Thad Schilling, a primary care physician and chief medical officer.
 Research suggests that 50% of primary care visits have a behavioral, psychiatric or psychological component. By bringing those resources directly to the point of care, physicians are serving patients much more effectively, he said.
 "When I can say to a patient, who is in distress and anxious, let me walk down the hall to another room and introduce you to my colleague, a psychologist, that's just a `wow' experience, a `wow moment,' " Schilling said.
 The movement toward an integrated model began two years ago. It was rolled out successfully at a few pilot sites and as of two weeks ago, is now established at all 10 facilities across Central Massachusetts.
 Samuel Nordberg, chief of behavioral health, noted the Reliant facilities are in different stages of integration. Some locations have been operating with the model for a year while others have had it only a few weeks.
 "We still have a lot to learn in terms of tweaks," he noted. "Our providers are integrated with primary care, and that's a cultural change. It happens patient by patient, interaction by interaction."
 Nordberg said that Reliant has hired 30 clinicians or 95% of the staff it needs, and the rest of the staff will all be on board by the end of the year.
 He said the way behavioral health care is traditionally structured leaves patients feeling desperate to get a provider and then to hold onto him/her.
 While patients can have "episodes of care," with a primary doctor for 20 years, coming in for something like strep throat, being treated, and then sent back to their lives, the situation is different for patients in mental health distress.
 "It's difficult to connect people with behavioral health resources. It takes time, phone calls and people having to wait," Schilling said. Patients in severe crisis go to the emergency room, but if the condition doesn't warrant hospitalization, they are sent home and told a provider will contact them sometime down the road.
 Primary care, in those instances, often becomes the "default" place for patients needing behavioral help to return when they can't get care in the community.
 "To try your best but not be able to provide those services is really frustrating," Schilling said. That's why, having integrated resources in the primary practice is so important.
 "To have help with assessment, crisis intervention and medication prescribing is a huge benefit for primary care providers," Schilling said.
 He added that some primary doctors have to "bump up their own skills," to become more aware and capable. "It's a rounding out of skills that has been enriching and empowering for providers. I feel more capable of handling some of these problems now that I have (behavioral health) experts with me."
 For services Reliant cannot provide directly, it will work in partnership with community agencies. Reliant will not operate a methadone clinic, for example.
 As they build stronger relationships with community resources, they will also look for gaps, according to Nordberg. Now that the model is fully staffed, he said they'll get a good sense of need and volume and consider building certain treatment hubs for specific disorders.
 He explained that there are limited resources in the community to meet the high number of people with trauma-related disorders. Similarly, there is limited access to evidence-based treatments for borderline personality disorders.
 With the new model, Reliant Medical Group is treating patients with these issues as well as substance abuse disorders, bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and a host of other behavioral health conditions.
 Emergency rooms are diverting patients into their care at a rate double of what was anticipated, according to Nordberg. Whether patients are referred because of a questionnaire administered, a question from their primary care doctor or because the patient asked for help, the Reliant team is "ready to adapt," he said.
 "We have a flexible approach however the patient's challenges emerge," Nordberg said.
 "To be able to get our patients' needs met in real time has been a real win," Schilling added.
 As for Mr. Grafton, he is feeling "very much better," after three months in Nordberg's care.
 "I can't praise him enough. He's awesome. He has the nicest personality and has helped me a lot."

Altman instead courted Naomi Watts (opposite Paul Newman as a brusque Wyoming rancher who lends his battered daughter-in-law refuge). When Weinstein later replaced Altman with Swedish director Lasse Hallström (“What’s Eating Gilbert Grape”), in turn losing the initial actors, he again advocated for Lopez. By then, “Gigli” was in the can but wouldn’t hit theaters for another year. Hallström was “open to the idea” right away, but Newman’s replacement, Robert Redford, wasn’t quite as keen, Ladd said. Ever the dark horse, Lopez was willing to convince anyone who needed convincing.

Several thousand came out for the protest in Washington, far fewer than last year when about 100,000 people held a rally east of the White House. But as in previous years, many of the protesters made the trip to the nation’s capital from cities across the country to express their opposition to Trump and his policies. From their gathering spot on Freedom Plaza, they had a clear view down Pennsylvania Avenue to the U.S. Capitol, where the impeachment trial gets underway in the Senate next week.

Almost a week after Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop grabbed headlines with its vagina- scented candles, American businesswoman Martha Stewart revealed that she is not interested in the USD 75 priced product, reported People magazine. The businesswoman revealed it on a talk show where she said that she wasn't aware of the 'vagina' scented candle but she was also not surprised after hearing about its personality.
 "I'm sure it's sold out. She does that kind of irritating... she's trying to zhuzh up the public to listen to her, and that's great. Let her do her thing," People magazine quoted Stewart saying. "I wouldn't buy that candle," Stewart added.
 The price of the candle named 'This Smells Like My Vagina' has been pegged at USD 75 and it is packed with the fragrance of geranium, cedar, and citrusy bergamot, according to the online shopping website Goop. "With a funny, gorgeous, sexy, and beautifully unexpected scent, this candle is made with geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed to put us in mind of fantasy, seduction, and a sophisticated warmth," reads the product description on the website.
 While Paltrow's beauty brand quickly made headlines after she announced the latest product, Stewart made it clear that she is not on board with the idea. This isn't the first time that Paltrow has introduced something as quirky and worth the eyebrow raises.
 According to Fox News, the actor's company grabbed headlines last year too with a holiday gift guide that consisted of a BDSM kit and earrings worth USD 43,000. (ANI)

“It’s a nice springboard for me in the new season to get such a good result in one of the first events of the new year," added Jamieson, who reckons he is feeling the benefit of having moved to America with his wife, Natalie, and their three young kids, just over two years ago.
 “I would like to think I am improving as a golfer as that was the big part of the decision moving to America," he said. "Even on the days when I only go and practice for two hours, I can take the kids with me whereas, if I was back home, practice time is limited and you want to be home with the family.
 “Two hours practice in Florida in the middle of December is a much higher quality than if I just went to the range back home in Scotland. I could have gone a month without hitting a putt on a ‘real’ green in Scotland whereas, in the States, I can go off to the golf course and put in two hours practice and it is high-quality practice."

Matt Scott has not featured in the Six Nations since 2017
 There's a story in the person he used to be as well. Scott was capped at most levels on the way to the top, but never had any confidence in his own ability. He says he hated his time with the Scotland U-20s because he was only playing fleetingly and also because he didn't really want to be a professional rugby player.
 He was studying law and playing for Currie and was happy to be a recreational player. "When I stepped up to Scotland U-20s I felt I was out of my depth," he recalled. "I didn't like the environment. I turned down a Glasgow academy contract in my second year at university because I wouldn't have been able to carry on law full-time and having studied so hard I wasn't giving it up for 10 grand a year.
 "In the back of my head, though, I was scared. I didn't have the confidence or the desire to commit to rugby. I didn't think I was good enough. The following year Edinburgh offered me an academy contract and said that I could carry on the law degree no problem. So I took it. I was on 12 grand a year and living at home. I played in a European Cup semi-final and then won my first cap against Ireland in 2012. It was all very quick. I loved it."
 Scott stayed with Edinburgh until 2016, when the dull, forwards-driven rugby under Alan Solomons became too much for him and he left for Gloucester, a move that hammered home "how sheltered my rugby brain had been." Gloucester played ambitious stuff and he revelled in it.
 In his first game he scored two tries against Leicester, in his second he scored again against Worcester. He got eight tries in his first 13 league games and scored four in six in the group stages of the Challenge Cup, where they went all the way to the final, back at Murrayfield, only to lose to Stade Francais.
 He was flying, then he got injured. Seven weeks out and everything changed. The management at Gloucester had to make big calls on new contracts while he was out of action and he was a victim of it. "It's a brilliant club, an old school rugby place that's full of history," he said. "Pictures of former players on the walls, beer-stained carpets in the clubhouse. There was a great feeling there.
 "I scored tries and made breaks that first season, but got injured in the third game of my second season and that was the beginning of the end. I wasn't ready to leave, but Gloucester didn't want to keep me. As it turned out, the move back to Edinburgh was a great thing."
 He's 29 now and is acutely aware of the competition around him for a place in Scotland's midfield. Getting into the wider squad was the easy bit. Now the real test comes. After months of torment last year he's back in the hunt, though. A contender. His old self again."

Joe Biden has secured a weighty Deep South endorsement for his presidential campaign, with Alabama's lone Democratic House member on Friday announcing her support for the former vice president.
   
 Terri Sewell marks Biden's 11th endorsement from the Congressional Black Caucus, far outpacing any other Democratic White House hopeful. Sewell also expands Biden's footprint across the March 3 Super Tuesday primary slate that will play an outsize role in determining the Democratic nominee.
   
 A Selma, Alabama, native whose congressional district includes seminal sites of the civil rights movement, Sewell told The Associated Press ahead of her announcement it was no coincidence she chose the weekend of Martin Luther King's birthday observance to make public her 2020 choice.
   
 "The No. 1 threat to my district is Donald Trump. The No. 1 threat to Martin Luther King's legacy is Donald Trump," Sewell said of the Republican president. "The best way I can counter that threat is to support someone who can beat him."
   
 Biden, she continued, "has a proven track record of furthering what Dr. King fought for" and can "protect that legacy" because he can appeal across the racial and ideological spectrum.
   
 "Joe has a special combination of vast experience, respectability and authenticity that is well-received by Republicans and Democrats and globally by our allies and foes," the fifth-term congresswoman said. Quoting her mother, she added, "Joe can talk to anyone."
   
 Sewell will campaign this weekend with Biden in South Carolina, which hosts the South's first presidential primary on Feb. 29.
   
 Biden now has virtually swept the most coveted endorsements among Alabama Democrats. Sen. Doug Jones is among his earliest supporters, and he recently picked up the endorsement of Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, a coup for Biden given the 38-year-old mayor's relationship with 2020 candidate Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator helped Woodfin in his upset mayoral bid, helping him defeat a two-term incumbent backed by establishment Democrats, including Sewell.
   
 The 55-year-old congresswoman's mother, Nancy Sewell, added her endorsement Monday, as well. She was the first black woman on the Selma City Council, elected in the decades following the Selma-to-Montgomery marches for voting rights.
   
 Alabama, where African Americans are expected to cast a majority of primary ballots, has 52 Democratic pledged delegates at stake, part of the 1,357 up for grabs on Super Tuesday. That's about a third of the party's pledged delegates nationally. Biden is in a cluster atop polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the two overwhelmingly white states that begin 2020 voting in early February. But polls consistently show him with a wide lead among black voters who make up significant portions of the states that follow, starting with Nevada and South Carolina and continuing through the Super Tuesday slate.
   
 Terri Sewell's announcement comes after Democrats' most high-profile black presidential candidates -- California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker -- ended their campaigns. Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick remains.
   
 Sewell praised the diversity of Democrats' historically large field and said it "saddens" her to see black candidates drop out. But Sewell said the hand- wringing over Democrats' all-white slate of remaining top contenders misses Biden's appeal and deep connections in the black community, especially among older African Americans and black women.
   
 That's even more important, Sewell continued, given increasingly overt racism in American society. "Trump has given people a license to be racist, sexist, misogynistic -- out loud," Sewell said. "My district longs for a normality and stability again, and they know Joe Biden. He is a well-worn shoe we are comfortable with and who we know will fight for our values."
   
 Sewell pointed specifically to Biden's work reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the 1970s as a young Delaware senator and his efforts as vice president to protect federal money for historically black colleges and universities. Sewell acknowledged the criticisms some younger black activists level at Biden over a legislative record that includes him criticizing busing as a school desegregation tool in the 1970s and his lead role in passage of the 1994 crime law now considered an aggravating factor in mass incarceration.
   
 "No long-serving elected official has a perfect legislative record. None of us do," Sewell said, arguing Biden's legislative experience is a net plus and means he can deliver more meaningful progress on issues including health care and income inequality, even if some of his proposals aren't as far-reaching as those from Sanders or Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
   
 "I like and respect all our candidates; any of them would be better than Donald Trump," Sewell said. "But Joe can win these battles."

 Deputies were called to 111 Roman Road at 10:25 p.m. for a shots fired report made to the Walton County Sheriff's Office dispatch center. The caller said they heard gunshots and then the sound of an injured dog.
   
 Deputies arrived and spoke to Billy Spires, 42, who said his dog killed a cat and he called his neighbor, Richard Wilson, 64, and asked him to bring a gun to the residence. Billy then took the handgun and shot the dog.

 The animal was still in the back yard, alive, and suffering from multiple gunshot wounds.
   
 Both men were identified by deputies as convicted felons.
   
 Spires was arrested and charged with animal cruelty and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Wilson was charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. They were both transported and booked into the Walton County Jail. Both men received a $5,000 bond.

 Four species of tree squirrels reside in Ohio, and all have their charms.
 The smallest and least known is the southern flying squirrel. It is common but seldom seen because of its strictly nocturnal habits.
 Slightly bigger is the red squirrel, which occurs statewide but is more localized than other squirrels. It has a distinct preference for coniferous trees.
 Most common is the well-known eastern gray squirrel, the typical squirrel of parks and suburbia in this area. Those who feed backyard birds wage war with this mammal. The squirrels often win.
 Then there is the largest squirrel of all, the gorgeous eastern fox squirrel. A whopper can weigh 3 pounds and stretch 3 feet or more from nose to outstretched tail tip. If there were a beauty pageant for squirrels, this one might wear the tiara.
 They are foxy indeed, with underparts tinted in showy burnt-orange. The upper pelage is a lovely grayish-black.
 From my experience, gray squirrels far outnumber foxes in Columbus and its neighborhoods. The latter becomes more common in rural areas.
 I recently moved to Worthington, an area I have long been acquainted with. Gray squirrels are abundant, but I have never seen a fox squirrel in my neighborhood -- until Jan. 9.
 That morning, I glanced out a back window to see a huge black squirrel sitting prominently on an open snag. It was as if it was posing for me. I usually keep a camera with a big telephoto lens at the ready, in case something bizarre appears at the feeders. Photographic prep paid dividends in this case.
 Not only did I document the yard's first fox squirrel, but it also was a rare melanistic morph, or form. My first thought was that it was a melanistic gray squirrel, but the massive size and tinges of orange bleeding through on the animal's underside gave it away.
 Black forms are far more common in gray squirrels, and in some parts of Columbus such animals are local celebrities. Melanin-enhanced fox squirrels seem to be virtually unknown, at least in Ohio. I have many biologically literate friends, and not one has said they have seen a black fox squirrel.
 Melanistic fox squirrels are known to occur, just in far fewer numbers than grays. Most black fox squirrels appear in the southern reaches of the range, which spans the eastern half of the U.S. Conversely, melanism in gray squirrels is more prolific in the northern parts of its distribution.
 Although the genetic mechanisms that produce melanism in squirrels is well- understood, the role of environmental factors that favor melanism, and possible gene flow between fox and gray squirrels, is lesser known.
 I have not seen the dusky fox squirrel since the day I discovered it. Maybe it's the vanguard of a wave to come, or it was a flash in the pan. Such animals would certainly enrich our squirrel diversity, that's for sure.

 “To people who are not sure I want to say check the register,” he said.
 Regarding the electoral commission, Mr Howlin said “we’re all sick and tired of after every election having loads of anomalies”. He called for “one central register” in order to take registration out of the hands of local authorities, “put together by an independent commission”, and said that people should have the ability to pre-register so that they are automatically qualified to vote when they turn 18.
 “But it must be much more powerful than that,” he said, adding that any commission must have the ability to regulate elections, fix debates and participants, and to “control who is spending money on the election”.

It's not looking good for "Mindhunter" fans eager for a third season of Netflix's locally filmed psychological-crime drama.
   
 According to multiple reports, Netflix released the show's cast from its contracts, including stars Holt McCallany and Jonathan Groff.
   
 "Mindhunter" producer David Fincher is busy directing his first Netflix film, "Mank," and producing the season of another Netflix show, "Love, Death and Robots."
   
 A Netflix spokesman told Deadline.com, "He may revisit 'Mindhunter' again in the future but in the meantime felt it wasn't fair to the actors to hold them from seeking other work while he was exploring new work of his own."
   
 Fans would be greatly disappointed if this is the demise of the critically acclaimed TV show about the FBI's first criminal profiling unit. Cameron Britton earned a well-deserved Emmy Award nomination for his performance as Edmund Kemper, a cerebral, physically imposing serial killer interviewed by the FBI unit.
   
 Seasons 1 and 2 of "Mindhunter" were filmed throughout the Pittsburgh area, including a couple of notable scenes shot in Ambridge. Many local extras earned screen time.
   
 In the five months since Season 2's debut, there has been no indication from Netflix that a Season 3 would return to western Pennsylvania for filming.
   
 "No, we have not been discussing a third season," Pittsburgh Film Office director Dawn Keezer said. "We hope it will come one day, everyone loves the show.
   
 "The Pittsburgh Film Office is currently focused on the current Netflix project 'Sweet Girl' and Sony's ' Happiest Season,' as well other potential projects for southwestern Pennsylvania," Keezer said. "Netflix is an important partner for the southwestern Pennsylvania film industry, and we welcome the opportunities to work with this amazing company."
   
 Chance to score AJR tickets
   
 This Tuesday is the makeup date for the AJR concert postponed from Nov. 22 at UPMC Events Center in Moon Township.
   
 That show originally had been a sellout, but through ticket refunds some seats (fewer than 100) are available Tuesday.
   
 AJR is a pop band featuring brothers Adam, Jack and Ryan Met. Jack came down with strep throat in November, prompting the band to postpone several shows, including the Robert Morris University one.
   
 Maybe you haven't heard of AJR -- I'm going into Tuesday's show cold -- but there must be a reason the lads sold more than 130,000 concert tickets in 2019, filling such prestigious venues as New York's Radio City Music Hall and Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheater.
   
 Local artists in the news
   
 Stephen Rubinosky's episode of "Judge Jerry" aired last week on WPXI-TV. The New Brighton pop singer squared off in a tenant-landlord dispute presided over by Jerry Springer himself in his new reality TV gig.
   
 The outcome doesn't really matter; point is, Rubinosky found another way to get some national TV exposure while staying buds with Springer, who originally had him on his more famous talk show in a done-for-laughs segment in which Rubinosky and another singer competed in a vocal duel to impress a girl.
   
 Rubinosky edited a recap video of the "Judge Jerry" episode you can see on his YouTube page.
   
 While there, check out the music video for Rubinosky's new song, "The Flame," also available on Spotify and iTunes.
   
 "I feel it's the definition of my sound, the slow, dancing love song with detailed lyrics," Rubinosky said. "It talks about falling in love; having that person be your 'flame,' the spark that keeps the two of you together. It's the first song I wrote as a solo artist, and I finally felt like it was time to release it."

A powerful storm system is toward the Atlantic Ocean and we are feeling the effects. As the low moves further toward the Atlantic, a cold front will drag through and change the wind direction to a more westerly wind that will initiate lake-effect snow. Temperatures are back below freezing. There will be many slick spots with the freeze Sunday morning. Watch for ice as you head out and about, especially on bridges and overpasses that may not be treated.This is where some areas see significant snowfall totals while others see just a few flurries. Wyoming County is under a Lake-Effect Snow Warning through Sunday night with snowfall totals (including what fell today) of over a foot. That will be similar for Oswego and points north through the Tug Hill Plateau. Locally there will only be an inch or two on top of what has fallen, unless we get caught under a snow belt that could bring a few more inches on top of that. Regardless, this could reduce visibility within snow bands and make travel difficult at times. There may be a few squalls that pass through as well, making blowing snow a concern.

Parents and educators can also assess the material being taught to students. It's important to think about the kinds of books young people are reading. Do they reflect a diversity of families, and a diversity of gender identities? If not, you can suggest new books for the curriculum, either to a teacher, the principal, or the school board, depending on how widely you want the new books to be read. If you're not able to change the curriculum, which could be a difficult process, you can always donate books to your school's library.

If you're a parent or guardian who hasn't talked about these things with your children yet, Kaufmann suggests introducing key elements about gender equality through a conversation about gender more broadly. In doing so, you'll be able to present new ideas and counter gender stereotypes they might learn elsewhere. For those just introducing conversations about gender, Kaufmann recommends focusing on common words or phrases, like "boys will be boys," that can normalize harmful behaviors.

Surrounding the character is a mixed bag of eccentric characters, with Borstein stealing every scene as Midge's manager Susie Myerson. The relationship between Midge and Susie is a cornerstone of the series. They're never out to get one another. Sure, they have disagreements, but there's never one over a man or an insult.
 "I always say it's like [ _The Mary Tyler Moore Show_ 's] Mary and Rhoda. They're very, very different. You can't imagine they'd be friends, and yet they need each other. It's similar to _Getting On_ ," Borstein told E! News. "It's really cool, these women that absolutely have to lean on each other are better people because of their relationship together."
 That's what makes _Mrs. Maisel_ such a special show. It's endlessly entertaining, with top-notch performances and a developed world to get lost in.

With the one-two punch of “Selena” and “Anaconda,” and the Golden Globe nod that accompanied the former, Lopez went from hopeful to headliner. But it was “Out of Sight” (1998) that certified her movie-star bona fides. Steven Soderbergh first tested Sandra Bullock for the role, but when Bullock and George Clooney’s chemistry didn’t click, Soderbergh told the studio he wouldn’t direct the movie if he couldn’t hire Lopez. The character needed to seem intrepid and sultry but not impervious; she had to fall in love with Clooney _and_ precipitate his downfall.

Her finest acting comes when she’s exuding control, and when she can use that control to mask a character’s vulnerability. Think of the “Out of Sight” scene when Lopez’s slick federal marshal has to shoot the criminal (George Clooney) she loves. Or the moment in “Selena” when she mocks the media’s scrutiny by bragging that her diet consists of pepperoni pizza and Doritos. Like “Hustlers,” those movies understand that Lopez’s charisma stems from her ability to win anyone over.

My wife and I are agonizing over a potential move due to imagined effects on our kids, ages 9 and 11. We (wife and I) dislike the house and town in which we live, and the schools are pretty poor and about to get much worse with a 25 percent budget cut. We are contemplating a move to a town 30–45 minutes away that is a nicer community where we’d be able to afford a nicer house, and where the schools are better, and we’d have a shorter commute. Our kids, however, are very comfortable and happy here—where they have lived all of their short lives, and where they have friends and activities and favorite hangouts. Neither of them are quick at adjusting to change, especially the younger one, who has gone through a great deal of anxiety about feeling like she doesn’t have friends and can’t make friends. And now, when she finally has some friends, we’re contemplating taking her away and making her start over! (I should add that although she now has friends, she doesn’t seem to have lost any of her anxiety about _not_ having friends or gained any confidence in her ability to make new ones.) How do we figure out if this move is worth making in spite of a possibly traumatic transition?

 People love to look inside other people's homes.
 That's no surprise to anyone who has gone to a real estate open house and found half the neighborhood there to get a peek inside their neighbor's house -- not with any intent to buy, but just because they're curious.
 And yet, it still can be surprising to see that curiosity represented in the statistics of visits to the Dispatch.com website when we post stories and photo galleries of homes for sale -- especially high-dollar houses.
 A story and photo gallery last week about a $1 million house built recently in the long-neglected South of Main neighborhood on the Near East Side had more than 86,000 page views in one day.
 But that pales in comparison to the stories and photos about the house known as the Huntington Mansion in Bexley, which was purchased by former Columbus City Schools Superintendent Dan Good and his partner, Doug Sadler, for $1.35 million in January 2019 and sold for $1.8 million on Aug. 20.
 All told, those two stories and photos attracted more than 1.3 million page views.
 As reporter Jim Weiker wrote last year, Good and Sadlerhad made improvements to the 11,000-square-foot home, such as replacing the four tankless water heaters, adding a new entrance gate, pruning the property's extensive trees, rewiring the home for Wi-Fi and security, repairing the fountain and irrigation system, and installing LED bulbs in the home's light fixtures -- all 300 of them.
 The eight-bedroom, eight-bathroom mansion on Drexel Avenue was built between 1923 and 1926 by banker Francis Ropes Huntington. Designed by New York City architect Alfred Hopkins, the home had been on and off the market for several years after undergoing a renovation when Good and Sadler purchased it.
 And while many central Ohioans no doubt have driven by the house and wondered what it is like inside, relatively few had the opportunity to see it -- until Weiker and the Dispatch photo staff allowed for a virtual tour of it.
 The home photo galleries we now post weekly are consistently popular. They feature high-end homes in Columbus and its suburbs, and most of the galleries draw a half-million or more page views.
 This past week's gallery of a Westerville house had more than 146,000 page views.
 The galleries are an extension of our efforts to quench the seemingly insatiable thirst readers have to see how other people live and the ideas they employ to build, remodel or decorate their homes.
 The At Home section in the Sunday Dispatch provides all sorts of glimpses into other people's homes and of trends and issues in home building, remodeling and decorating -- as well as landscaping and gardening.
 And the Dispatch Home & Garden Show, which is coming Feb. 22 through March 1 to the State Fairgrounds, is the place to not only see the latest trends, issues and products but also to talk with the vendors and other experts who make, build or install them.
 It's clear by the traffic to these sites and shows that homes are a hot topic, and we do our best to satisfy your interest in seeing how other people live and how their ideas for homes, decor and gardening might help you improve your home.
