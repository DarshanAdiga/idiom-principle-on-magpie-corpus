The Pompas have now been banned from all city centre pubs for two years.
 Both brothers, described as working family men, admit they were so drunk they could not recall the incident – but were quickly reminded by crystal clear CCTV footage.
 Judge Paul Darlow told Ladiaslavi, aged 34, and 31-year-old Emil: “We are not talking about 17-year-olds who cannot hold their liquor.
 “This was sustained high-level violence used indiscriminately. You did not care whom you hit, whatever the age or gender.
 “You are still here as guest in this country, please acknowledge that and behave as guests should.”

Judge James Townsend jailed Giles for four years.
 He said: “You quite deliberately drove in an appalling manner. I have no doubt you wish you could turn the clock back.
 “Not only did you end the life of an active and much-loved man, you also deeply affected the much-extended family around him.
 “You were riding a motorcycle you were unlicensed to ride, it was too powerful, and you were doing so at a grossly excessive speed.”
 Judge Townsend banned him from the road for six years, taking into account the time he is likely to spend behind bars. Giles will also have to take an extended test before he is allowed back on the road.
