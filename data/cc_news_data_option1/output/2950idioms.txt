So we are now hearing the word _betrayal_ from cultural conservatives who have long felt ill served by Republican Supreme Court appointments over the years. President Trump quickly responded to the brouhaha by announcing he would soon release a new and improved list of SCOTUS prospects. What that means seems to be up in the air, though it probably means fewer jurists whose views on hot- button constitutional issues are in doubt, as Politico’s Gabby Orr reports:

Jerónimo López Ramírez is a world-renowned Mexican tattoo artist who used to carry the tools of his trade around in an old-fashioned physician’s bag. As his alter-ego, “Dr. Lakra,” Ramírez also creates works on paper in which he “tattoos” found images as diverse as Japanese prints, political posters, and anatomical drawings, with ink, paint or chalk. He pulls his imagery from comic books and graffiti, gang tattoos and Maori body-modification, engaging, as Frida Kalho did, with Day of the Dead iconography and the work of the famous nineteenth century Mexican artist José Guadalupe Posada. _Lakra_ , we’re told, is a Spanish slang word connoting delinquency; it’s also a pun on _lacra_ , which means a flaw or scar. If you’re at all interested in post-modern kinds of analysis, the clash of high and low art, or in thinking about cultural imperialism, the show I’ve just described will probably pique your curiosity.

So I was just kind of curious obviously this is all about sort of expanding or accelerating Qualtrics growth and expanding the category. Can you just give us a couple of examples of your conversations why you think this is the right way to go?

Estimates from Zillow, the real-estate-data website, show that home values have risen one percent in the region as a whole from December to June, lagging behind a national increase of 2.3 percent. But there are major differences based on where a home is located within Greater New York. Manhattan had the softest home prices of any county in the New York area, down 1.4 percent. Values were close to flat in Brooklyn and Queens and in New Jersey’s densest county, Hudson, which includes Jersey City and Hoboken. But prices were up more than 2 percent in Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley and in the four close-in New Jersey suburban counties just beyond Hudson County: Bergen, Passaic, Essex, and Union. (While _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ reported on the coronavirus driving a surge in interest in suburban moves to Connecticut, these Zillow data suggest New Jersey is the bigger gainer; the site has values in Fairfield County, Connecticut, up only a bit more than one percent.)

Each tube can hold one-half ounce (15 grams) of core samples, and the goal is to gather about a pound (0.5 kilogram) altogether for return to Earth. NASA hopes to launch the pickup mission in 2026 and get the samples back on Earth by 2031 -- at the soonest.

Ultimately, the works in this show seem like drafts—rough gestures, preparations toward new images, new art. As they are, they don’t stand up to the gaze. And they are, to a certain extent, hurt by the intensely intellectual language that accompanies them. Dr. Lakra himself is quoted as saying that “tattoos have a purpose. They have to fit the body, and abide by certain rules…The skin is alive and it will change and you have to think about this in order to do a proper tattoo. But when I draw, I don’t have to think about these factors.” This assessment seems spot-on; in these works on paper there’s a disconnect between the original image and what is added. In the end, this show seemed like a rehearsal. It made me want to see the real thing—the tattoo art made by the man who sometimes calls himself Dr. Lakra.

And if you look at Q2, our operating margin is up almost two percentage points. Despite the heavy toll on top line the crisis have sustain. But let me make one thing clear. We will continue to manage this company for value, not short-term margin maximization. If we believe a strategic move is wide, if we think it makes sense to accelerate the cloud migration of our customer base, if we see an opportunity to grow where we have a why to win, we will investigate, and not pass by default, just because revenue mix shift might have an adverse impact on operating margin and in the short run.

Now, we still have to see what does this means with regard to the revenue mix in our P&L.

From a strategic standpoint on two fronts, we see massive opportunity. Number one is, look there are a bunch of other strategic providers that I think that we could go partner with. It's not that they weren't willing to partner, but we want to do big things with them and I think this will help. And I think we'll try to pattern a little bit after what we're doing with SAP where experience management is a core part of all products and platform. And you start thinking about hey every single app on the Internet should have a Qualtrics component built in to be able to have a conversation with the end user, right? You think about every product either back office or front office could have that same integration you start to see how important the Qualtrics platform is. But probably most importantly there's a lot of technology that we like out there. So I think this gives us an opportunity to go make our own acquisitions and be able to truly expand our vision for what experience management can be and really continue to paint what we saw years ago. I mean, I've been doing this for 20 years solving the same problem and we have this vision of where this can go and to have SAP behind us and then be able to go run and go get the best talent in the world to go do this and get people on board. As Christian said, we just can't see any downsides to this. And I think that as we've slept on this for quite a few weeks now we're saying "Hey, we still feel more excited than we did when we first came up with it." So that's a pretty good sign.

So we should be a little bit better. That's the plan. There's still adjustments to be made, but that's hard to do.

A Ridgetown-area summer camp is projecting a $60,000 deficit this year, so its executive director is calling on upper levels of government and the community for support.
 With no campers this summer due to restrictions related to COVID-19, Dan Richards of Kenesserie Camp said its revenues have taken a large hit, but some expenses, such as insurance, property tax and hydro, still need to be paid.
 "This year, for sure, it's a struggle to try and make ends meet," he said. "The future of Kenesserie - it kind of does depend on some kind of outpouring of support for the rest of this year because we have very few opportunities for creating revenue."
 The camp, which began in 1903, is using the federal government's 75 per cent wage subsidy program to help pay for its one year-round employee, Richards said. It also received a small business loan from the federal government, but that has to be paid back, he said.
 Kenesserie is also offering a virtual camp this year, which includes an activity box sent to families, but Richards said the revenue from this initiative is not nearly enough to cover the $60,000 shortfall.
 The organization's largest fundraiser is usually a walkathon held in June, but that was also cancelled this year. Richards said the camp is looking at holding a virtual walkathon in the fall.
 "Last year, we made over $20,000 for the first time in a number of years," he said. "We're pretty excited about running it this year and increasing that even more."
 Richards said some of the parents who signed up their children ahead of time decided to change their deposits or payments into donations, which he appreciated.
 About 600 campers attend each summer, according to Richards. Of those, about 100 are part of what is called a "campership" program, where Kenesserie covers 40 kids through an internal fund and the other 60 are supported by other organizations, he said.
 Kenesserie also usually brings in about 1,000 children for year-end field trips and hosts church groups, family reunions and other non-profits for different retreats. Richards said none of this is happening this year.
 Richards said the Canadian Camping Association and Ontario Camps Association are both trying to convince the provincial and federal governments to provide more support for camps.
 He said usually half of the time someone he meets finds out he works for Kenesserie, that person either attended the camp or has children who attended.
 "There is this huge population in Chatham-Kent that have experienced what Kenesserie has to offer and we need their help," Richards said.
 "We are exploring other avenues of revenue, but they're not going to generate what we need to come out of the year even so that we don't go into next year with that debt hanging over us."
