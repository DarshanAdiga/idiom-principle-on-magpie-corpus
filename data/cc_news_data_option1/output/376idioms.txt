The Lady Streaks battled through another close game on Saturday evening, falling 46-40 to the hosting Logan Elm Lady Braves.
 Piketon gained the initial lead in the contest, going up 11-9 after the opening quarter. Hayleigh Risner led the Lady Redstreaks inside with a pair of baskets and a free throw, while Ava Little and Bailey Vulgamore each connected on a trifecta.
 The two teams flipped scoring in the second, as the Lady Braves produced 11 points and Piketon added nine. That translated into a 20-20 tie at the break. Kennedy Jenkins led the Lady Redstreaks in that quarter with a bucket and two free throws. Vulgamore and Risner each added a basket, while Jazz Lamerson split a pair of free throws.
 Coming out of halftime, the game remained close. Jenkins started where she left off, adding six points to lead PHS during that stretch. Vulgamore was fouled on a three-point try, responding to hit all three of her free throws. Jazz Lamerson added a point from the line as well. Heading to the final quarter, Piketon was in front 30-29.
 The final quarter saw Logan Elm score 10 points from the field, matching Piketon's total output. The Lady Braves also went 7-of-8 from the line to put the contest away. Leading for Logan Elm in that quarter was Abby Hatter, who scored 11 of the 21 points, including a 6-for-6 performance from the line. Hatter finished with 21 points for the game. Riley Shultz added 15 points.
 For Piketon, Jenkins and Vulgamore each produced 12 points, followed by Risner with nine points.
 The Lady Redstreaks (6-13, 2-9 SVC) were scheduled to play an SVC road game at Zane Trace on Tuesday. They will be back home Thursday evening to face Paint Valley.

This is the moment of truth for Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu.
 Senators will Wednesday vote to, either uphold his impeachment, or dismiss the charges filed before it.
 The House started hearing the charges against the governor Tuesday following his impeachment by Members of Kiambu County Assembly on December 19, 2019.
 The MCAs accuse the governor of abuse of office, gross misconduct and gross violation of the Constitution, the County Government Act and the Public Finance Management Act.
 If the senators uphold any of the impeachment charges, Mr Waititu shall cease to hold office in line with section 33 (7) the County Government Act. By operation of Article 182 (2) of the Constitution, Mr Waititu’s deputy, Dr James Nyoro, will take over as Kiambu’s new governor for the remainder of the term.
 Subsection 3 (a) of this Article provides that one shall be deemed to have served a full term as governor if at the date on which the person assumed office, more than two and a half years remain before the date of the next election.

PLYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts high school principal had a blood-alcohol level nearly three times the legal limit when he was arrested for alleged drunk driving, court records show. Plymouth South High School Principal James Hanna, 49, was arraigned Monday. He was fired from the school shortly after. Hanna pleaded not guilty to charges of operating under the influence of liquor, negligent operation and injury from mobile phone use, according to court records. He was arrested Saturday night after allegedly rear-ending another driver in Plymouth. The police report stated the victim in the vehicle wasn't hurt but his female passenger was taken to a nearby hospital after complaining of neck and back pain. Hanna's attorney, Stephen Jones, when reached by phone by The Associated Press on Tuesday, said he had no comment.

Memmel's visit to Morse Street School was special because he was able to spend the day with a young boy he has known for years.
 Five-year-old Harvey Burgess of Freeport was also born with an arm difference.
 The Burgess family met Memmel at a Helping Hands Foundation event in Massachusetts five years ago.
 "I've known Harvey since he was very very young. I've known his family for a long time. So this day has been a long time in the works," says Memmel. "This opportunity to be here and share this message with his school feels like we're coming full circle."
 Harvey's mother Barbara Burgess says she hopes having Memmel at the school will help show kids her son is no different from them.
 "They can see Tony and say oh yeah, Harvey _can_ do whatever, because look at Tony who is here playing guitar, traveling the world playing the guitar," Barbara Burgess said.
 Memmel says everyone has a metaphorical "lucky fin," something that makes them different, and can learn from his message of resilience.
 "Lucky fin doesn't necessarily mean a hand of limb difference. While we're not all going through the same thing, we're all going through something," says Memmel.
 Shriners Children's Hospital, Angel City Sports and the Lucky Fin Project are just a few of the wonderful organizations Tony works with while he travels the world inspiring others.

 The report did a good job of breaking down the projects/programs allocated money -- such as the $23.5-million spent on prevention initiatives (the community healing program for one) and the $15.1-million allocated to the Toronto Youth Job Corp.
 But under the "impact" section, it only talked about, by my count, 484 youth in total actually getting jobs over five years.

However, Sandgren was not ready to surrender, breaking twice in the second set as Federer’s touch abandoned him, sending down 15 unforced errors.
 Playing in the mid-afternoon sun, he continued to struggle in the third, broken in his opening service game with the crowd stunned into silence.
 Federer was rattled. He worked three break points when 2-0 down and when Sandgren saved two of them, the Swiss was warned for an audible obscenity, reported by the line judge.
 The normally unflappable star confronted the umpire and then lost three more points, again having words with the official before taking a near nine-minute medical timeout.
 “I found it a bit tough,” he said of the penalty. “It’s not like I’m known to throw around words and whatever. It’s not like the whole stadium heard it either.”
 Federer returned to hold serve, but his movement was hampered — and he never threatened, losing the set with another 15 unforced errors.
 He grimly hung on in the fourth set, saving three match points at 5-4. It went to a tiebreaker, where more drama was in store as a ball kid collided with Sandgren at the changeover.
 Federer incredibly saved another four match points before winning the tiebreak 10-8, sending the crowd into a frenzy.

Koch said she and fellow astronaut Jessica Meir appreciated that the Oct. 18 spacewalk "could serve as an inspiration for future space explorers.”
 “We both drew a lot of inspiration from seeing people that were reflections of ourselves as we were growing up and developing our dreams to become astronauts,” Koch told The Associated Press from the space station. "So to recognize that maybe we could pay that forward and serve the same for those that are up and coming was just such a highlight."
 Koch's astronaut class of 2013 was split equally between women and men, but NASA's astronaut corps as a whole is male dominated. Right now, four men and two women are living at the space station.
 “Diversity is important, and I think it is something worth fighting for,” said Koch, an electrical engineer who also has a physics degree.
 Koch's 328-day mission will be the second-longest by an American, trailing Scott Kelly's flight by 12 days. She's already set a record for the longest single spaceflight by a woman.
 She took time out for a pair of news interviews Tuesday, the 34th anniversary of the space shuttle Challenger accident that claimed all seven lives on board.
 She said she loves her work — she conducted five spacewalks and tended to science experiments — but she also misses her friends and family.
 "If they could visit here, I would continue staying for a very long time,” Koch, a first-time space flier, told the AP. “For their sake, I think that it's probably time to head home.”
 Her biggest surprise is how easily and quickly she adapted both mentally and physically to weightlessness.
 “I don't even really realize that I'm floating any more,” she said.
 Why do chips and salsa top her most-missed food list? Crunchy food like chips are banned on the space station because the crumbs could float away and clog equipment. “I haven't had chips in about 10 1/2 months,” she explained, “but I have had a fresh apple” thanks to regular cargo deliveries.
 Another thing she misses: the ability to put things down and not have them float away.
 She's gotten used to using Velcro and tape to make things stay put, “so I hope that when I go back to Earth, I don't accidentally drop things, especially when I'm handing them to people.”
 Kelly, whose mission spanned 2015 and 2016, has given her advance notice of what to expect.

A death penalty repeal bill has failed five times since 2007. Last year, a repeal bill failed after Senator Rhonda Fields, a Democrat from Aurora, chastised fellow lawmakers for rolling out the bill too quickly. Fields lost her son, Javad Marshall Fields, when he and his fiancee, Vivian Wolfe, were killed in 2005 by two of the three individuals who are currently on death row in Colorado. Another well-known Democrat, Representative Tom Sullivan of Aurora, also spoke in a committee hearing last year in favor of keeping the death penalty. Sullivan's son, Alex, was killed in the 2012 Aurora theater shooting. The two lawmakers still both oppose repeal.
 Recognizing the criticism, proponents tabled the bill, saying they'd be back in 2020.
 Although Fields didn't testify during yesterday's hearing, her daughter, Maisha Fields, delivered about twenty minutes of testimony in opposition to the bill. "This death penalty bill puts victims against victims. It puts people who are suffering day to day against one another," Maisha Fields said.
 Multiple prosecutors also spoke in favor of keeping the death penalty and urged lawmakers to let the issue be solved by voters. "This is a decision that the people should make. The people can petition to abolish the death penalty if they choose to do so," said Dave Young, district attorney for the 17th Judicial District, which includes Adams and Broomfield counties.
 Denver District Attorney Beth McCann disagreed with Young.
 "We have seen these really significant, important issues get lost in the political advertising, in the amount of money that is spent. And depending on who has the resources, that side gets so much more attention. I think this particular decision is so critically important that subjecting it to that political process would not be appropriate," said McCann, who favors repeal.
 While Fields and Young were part of a group of seven who testified against repealing the death penalty, McCann and over forty others spoke in favor of repeal.
 "My spirit tells me to tell you that we're all being damaged in our spirits by having the death penalty," Tim Ricard, the husband of Mary Ricard, a Colorado corrections officer killed by an inmate in 2012, testified at the hearing.
 Ricard told lawmakers that he and his family kept telling prosecutors that they didn't want Miguel Alonso Contreras-Perez, the inmate who killed Mary, to be sentenced to death. But their pleas were ignored.
 "Every time we went to a court hearing or met with them, we were re-victimized and frustrated because they weren't listening to us, obviously," Ricard said. Contreras-Perez and prosecutors in Crowley County eventually came to a plea agreement that keeps him in prison for life without the possibility of parole.

WASHINGTON (AP) — For much of the last 20 years, John Bolton was a conservative poster child, a Republican hawk whose worldview helped shape the GOP establishment’s approach to dicey foreign policy questions. Now, as the former national security adviser prepares to dish on his days in the White House, some of his old friends and colleagues are turning on him — and others are nervously wondering what he may be poised to reveal. Leaked passages from the manuscript of Bolton's soon-to-be published book are roiling Washington, including the revelation that he says Trump told him he was conditioning the release of military aid to Ukraine on whether its government would help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Bolton's roughly 17-month tenure in as national security adviser brought him rare access to the inner workings of the West Wing and the Cabinet, particularly on matters of global affairs. He was known to take copious notes on yellow legal pads. After this week's early leaks about the book, White House aides and allies are privately expressing concern about what more Bolton might reveal that the president and others in his orbit would find embarrassing. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., gave voice to GOP pique about Bolton’s revelations in an interview with Fox News. He said Bolton had long argued for expansive executive powers to protect a president’s conversations with his advisers but “now he’s going to argue that no, no, no, now that I have a book deal for a couple of million bucks, that it’s OK for me to say and spill the beans on everything the president’s said to me privately.” Less than two years ago, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and Trump impeachment team manager, praised the president for bringing Bolton into the White House, saying the president “could not...

Between now and the end of March there will be approximately three million lambs born in Ireland. A significant number of those will take their first, tentative steps on Wexford soil courtesy of the some 96,000 ewes in the county. And a smaller, but no less significant, amount may not be born at all, dying in the womb because someone forget to lock up their dog at night. Pat Murray, is the Wexford representative on the IFA's (Irish Farmer's Association) Sheep Committee, and he estimates that 20 dog attacks occur throughout the county each year. That might not seem like a lot, but some of the more severe attacks can have devastating consequences for the farmers involved. One such Enniscorthy farmer, who preferred not to be named, lost 68 sheep during an attack last year, an incident which cost him, in financial terms, €8,000, but an intangible amount in terms of stress and worry. 'The two dogs entered the shed shortly after 9 a.m. on the day. I discovered them that evening, sometime after 5 p.m. As a result of the attack 68 sheep were slaughtered or had to be humanely put down,' he says. 'When I came into the shed and saw what had happened my initial reaction was one of disbelief, I just couldn't believe what I was looking at.' Although he tries to downplay the emotional impact of the attack, the farmer admits it left him 'distressed', the shock of seeing his animals massacred having a longterm impact. 'I'm paranoid about it happening again, I've been putting more cameras in the shed but I don't have WiFi there so have to top them up with credit to make sure they're always on.' Then there's the financial cost. Although insured against dog attacks the scale of the attack meant the Enniscorthy man was left out of pocket to the tune of €8,000. And this was just one of several attacks he has endured in recent years, each with a common denominator. 'People don't realise that once a dog gets a taste for blood it doesn't matter if they're a doberman or a terrier. I've had several dog attacks over the years but this was the worst one and in each case there was always a husky involved.' 'This attack involved a husky and a doberman but the doberman didn't do a tenth of the damage the husky did. Those dogs are bred to kill and they're not even on the dangerous dog list.' For Pat, the emphasis is on ensuring dog-owners act responsibly, regardless of the breed. 'It's about responsible dog ownership, making sure to have them on a lead at all times. There's plenty of dangerous dogs out there, and for any dog their immediate instinct is to run after a sheep. 'People don't realise the damage that can be done, and the implications, some of it which isn't always seen. At this time of the year the ewes can end up aborting after the attack, through the stress, the physical toll, of having to run away.' Working in tandem with the Dog Warden, Pat is striving to educate the public on the danger their dogs present to farmers. 'We're trying to be proacive, urging people to keep their dogs locked up a night. Even if you leave them out for half and hour they can go and do damage, and there's more attacks in the darker evenings,' Pat says. Currently dog owners can be fined up to €200 for not controlling their animals, a figure which Pat would like to see increased. 'The law needs to be tightened up, and stronger fines should be introduced. The databases for dogs need to be linked too, there's currently four of them and we need to have just one' With a current flock of between 500-600 sheep and lambing season in full swing, then Enniscorthy farmer believes harsher penalties need to be introduced to help protect not just his animals but also his livelihood. 'The guards need to have more severe fines for people who don't have licenses for their dogs, and they need to police rural areas more. There's still dogs loose around here, although they haven't done anything yet,' he says. And with last year's attack still fresh in his memory the farmer says he wouldn't hesitate to act if faced with a similar situation. 'I have the right to shoot a dog. Would I? If I seen him attacking one of my sheep I would.'

Mi Quang is another noodle bowl that's not quite a soup, a central Vietnamese dish that comes with sesame rice crackers. "We serve it with very little broth, but people from the middle of Vietnam ask for even less," he says. "When you taste the broth, it's like art -- you don't need much." Now Pho's mi Quang sports broad egg noodles and comes with pork ribs and shrimp or bone-in chicken.
 Everything at the restaurant is made from scratch, even the crab cheese wontons, something often added to Vietnamese menus simply to appeal to Western tastes. Tran's wontons are stuffed with an herby mix of cheese and real crab, so much that it explodes out the top when the wonton is fried. The sweet-and- sour dipping sauce, too, is housemade, and isn't the typical neon red.
 Tran and Le recently opened a second Now Pho, at 1500 West Littleton Boulevard in Littleton; the hours there are less expansive and the menu is smaller and more tailored toward American tastes, since the Vietnamese population is much smaller in that area than in the neighborhoods along South Federal. At the original Now Pho, Le says, "our customers are 50 percent Vietnamese and 50 percent everyone else."
 For those customers, Now Pho is almost a community gathering place. The South Federal spot stays open well past the usual 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, when night owls keep dropping in and the kitchen keeps serving until 3 a.m. But it doesn't close for long: On any day of the week, you can start slurping noodles at 9 a.m., making Now Pho a refreshing breakfast stop, too, if you're looking to live in the moment beyond lunch and dinner.

Jack Hughes on Monday helped bail out the New Jersey Devils after they gave up a lead in the third period. Kyle Palmieri tied it late in the third period, while Nikita Gusev and Hughes scored in the shootout to lift the Devils to a 4-3 win over the Ottawa Senators.
 Hughes, who sealed the win in the second round of the shootout, also scored the overtime winner when the teams met in Ottawa on Dec. 29.
 “It was exciting to help the team win,” Hughes said. “That’s a good comeback win for us — and not just take one point, but take two... It was important for us to come back and get that win.”
 Damon Severson and Kevin Rooney also scored in regulation for the Devils, who snapped a three-game losing streak. Goalie Mackenzie Blackwood, making his first start since Jan. 9, stopped 35 shots.
 “I thought in general that it was a really good effort,” Devils interim coach Alain Nasreddine said. “Obviously not exactly how we drew it up at the end, but we’ve talked about resiliency now for a while. At 3-2, it wasn’t a good way to go down, but the guys found a way and tied it up, and found a way to get two points in the end. It was a great effort.”
 The Senators’ Tyler Ennis, Vladislav Namestnikov and Chris Tierney scored for Ottawa. Goalie Marcus Hogberg had 50 saves through overtime, but gave up two goals on two shots in the tiebreaker.
 The Senators trailed 2-1 heading into the third period before scoring two short-handed goals in a span of 35 seconds to take the lead: Namestnikov tied it 2-2 with a quick wrist shot at 9 minutes, 6 seconds before Tierney made it 3-2.
 “When we took the lead, we had a lot of momentum, especially with two short- handed goals,” Tierney said. “It’s tough to give up one late there, but you’ve got to find a way to get the extra point sometimes.”

WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump unveiled his long-awaited Middle East plan Tuesday, winning immediate praise from a beaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but a swift rejection from the Palestinians, who called it "nonsense."
 Trump's plan calls for the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, but it falls far short of minimal Palestinian demands and would leave sizable chunks of the occupied West Bank in Israeli hands.
 Netanyahu said he would move forward on Sunday and ask his Cabinet to approve plans to annex West Bank territory -- an explosive move that is likely to be met with harsh international reaction.
 Trump called his plan a "win-win" for both Israel and the Palestinians, and Netanyahu called it a "great plan for Israel."
 At a speech in the West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the plan as "nonsense."
 "We say 1,000 no's to the Deal of the Century," Abbas said, using a nickname for Trump's proposal.
 "We will not kneel and we will not surrender," he said, adding that the Palestinians would resist the plan through "peaceful, popular means."
 With Netanyahu standing beside him, Trump presented the plan at a White House ceremony filled with other Israeli officials and allies, including evangelical Christian leaders and wealthy Republican donors but no Palestinian representatives.
 The ceremony came amid Trump's impeachment trial and a U.S. election year, and after Netanyahu was indicted on counts of fraud, breach of trust and bribery in three separate cases. The longtime Israeli leader, who denies any wrongdoing, also faces a March 2 parliamentary election, Israel's third in less than a year.
 The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank and east Jerusalem -- areas captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war -- for an independent state and the removal of more than 700,000 Israeli settlers from these areas.
 But as details emerged, it became clear that the plan sides heavily with Netanyahu's hard-line nationalist vision for the region and shunts aside many of the Palestinians' core demands.
 Under the terms of the "peace vision" that Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has been working on for nearly three years, all settlers would remain in place, and Israel would retain sovereignty over all of its settlements as well as the strategic Jordan Valley.
 The proposed Palestinian state would also include more than a dozen Israeli "enclaves" with the entity's borders monitored by Israel. In addition, the areas of east Jerusalem offered to the Palestinians consist of poor, crowded neighborhoods located behind a hulking concrete separation barrier.
 Trump acknowledged that he has done a lot for Israel, but he said he wanted the deal to be a "great deal for the Palestinians."
 He said his vision gives the Palestinians the time needed for them to meet the challenges of statehood.
 The only concession the plan appears to demand of Israel is a four-year freeze on the establishment of new Israeli settlements in certain areas of the West Bank. But Netanyahu clarified later that this only applied to areas where there are no settlements and Israel has no immediate plans to annex, and that he considered the plan to impose no limitations on construction.
 Thousands of Palestinians protested in Gaza City ahead of the announcement, burning pictures of Trump and Netanyahu and raising a banner reading "Palestine is not for sale."
 Trump said he sent a letter to Abbas to tell him that the territory that the plan has set aside for a new Palestinian state will remain open and undeveloped for four years.
 "It's going to work," Trump said. "If they do this, it will work. Your response to this historic opportunity will show the world to what extent you are ready to lead the Palestinian people to statehood."
 "President Abbas, I want you to know, that if you chose the path to peace, America and many other countries ... we will be there to help you in so many different ways. And we will be there every step of the way," Trump said.
 The 50-page plan builds on a 30-page economic plan for the West Bank and Gaza that was unveiled last June and which the Palestinians have also rejected.
 The plan envisions a future Palestinian state consisting of the West Bank and Gaza, connected by a combination of roads and tunnels. It also would give small areas of southern Israel to the Palestinians as compensation for lost West Bank land.
 But the many caveats, and ultimate overall Israeli control, made the deal a nonstarter for the Palestinians.
 Netanyahu and his main political challenger in March elections, Benny Gantz, had signed off on the plan.
 "Mr. President, because of this historic recognition and because I believe your peace plan strikes the right balance where other plans have failed," Netanyahu said. "I've agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan. It's a great plan for Israel. It's a great plan for peace."
 Tuesday's developments set the contours for his election campaign.
 Netanyahu will highlight his close relationship with Trump and the "historic opportunity" provided by the peace plan, while Gantz will focus on Netanyahu's legal woes. Netanyahu will soon go on trial for a series of corruption charges.
 The Jordan Valley annexation plan is a big part of Netanyahu's strategy. Annexing West Bank land is a key promise meant to appeal to his hard-line nationalist base.
 U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the plan's release, said they expected negative responses from the Palestinians, as well as Turkey and Iran, but were hopeful that Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab nations to have peace treaties with Israel, would not reject it outright.
 Jordan gave the plan a cool reaction, saying it remained committed to a two- state solution based on Israel's pre-1967 lines. It also said it rejected any unilateral move by Israel, referring to the annexation plan.
 Egypt, the first Arab country to reach a peace deal with Israel, urged Israelis and Palestinians to carefully study the plan. The European Union also said it needed to study it more closely.
 Officials said they expected Gulf Arab states like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others to cautiously welcome the plan.
 Arab League chief, Ahmed Abuel-Gheit said the Palestinian reaction would define the Arab response. He spoke after meeting with Palestinian official Jibril Rajoub at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo.
 The reaction of Jordan, which would retain its responsibilities over Jerusalem's al-Aqsa Mosque under the plan, is particularly significant, according to the officials, who said Kushner and others were reaching out to Arab leaders ahead of the rollout.
 The Palestinians see the West Bank as the heartland of a future independent state and east Jerusalem as their capital. Most of the international community supports their position, but Trump has reversed decades of U.S. foreign policy by siding more blatantly with Israel. The centerpiece of his strategy was recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the American Embassy there. He's also closed Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington and cut funding to Palestinian aid programs.
 Those policies have proven popular among Trump's evangelical and pro-Israel supporters.
 But the Palestinians refuse to even speak to Trump and they called on support from Arab leaders. The Palestinian leadership also has encouraged protests in the West Bank, raising fears of a new round of violence. Ahead of the announcement, the Israeli military said it was reinforcing infantry troops along the Jordan Valley.

Three weeks after their last home game, the Los Angeles Kings will get reacquainted with their home ice when they play host to the Tampa Bay Lightning on Wednesday.
 At least it can't get any worse since the last time the Kings were around these parts. They lost three consecutive home games, Jan. 4-8, before heading out on a long trip that led into the All-Star break.
 The Kings also lost their last four games before the break, and have dropped seven of their past eight contests and 11 of 14.
 Their first game after the break will offer a chance to hit the reset button, but at 18-27-5 (41 points), and last in the Western Conference, a playoff push is unlikely. A vow to simply get better every day would be the best way to handle the final two months of the schedule.
 "We're out of the playoffs by a little bit and certainly not the position we want to be in, but at the same time we're trying to turn this thing around, so you want to go and steer this ship in the right direction," the Kings' lone All-Star representative, Anze Kopitar, told the Los Angeles Times.
 Yet uncertainty surrounds the team that won Stanley Cup titles as recently as 2013-14 and 2011-12. Moves are possible before the Feb. 24 trade deadline. Tyler Toffoli could be a desired commodity, while Alec Martinez and Jeff Carter have also been mentioned as trade candidates.
 "There's going to be some stuff that's going to get moved around, but at the same time you've just got to keep your head down and work towards our common goal, which is turn this thing around and get it going in the right direction," Kopitar said.
 The Lightning are in playoff contention, sitting in second place in the Atlantic Division at the start of play Tuesday. Although they did earn a point Monday, their hopes of getting off to a hot post-break start were foiled when they fell, 3-2, in overtime at Dallas.
 Tampa Bay was just 2-2 in their final four games before the break following their 10-game winning streak that started just before Christmas. Monday's defeat can fall into the category of post-break rust.
 "We gave up more chances tonight on odd-man rushes than we've given up the last 20 games combined," Tampa Bay head coach Jon Cooper said.
 Lightning goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy made 32 saves, but his 10-game winning streak came to an end. Steven Stamkos scored two goals against the Stars. His third-period goal tied it with less than two minutes remaining after Vasilevskiy was pulled for an extra attacker.
 Nikita Kucherov had two assists for the Lightning right out of the break and leads the team in goals (22), assists (34) and points (56). Tampa Bay was 0-for-4 on the power play.
 "The power play wasn't great (Monday), and we didn't generate many high- quality chances," the Lightning's Brayden Point told NHL.com. "They did a good job and give them credit, but it's on us to work out plays that can generate scoring chances."

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Parents who no longer qualify for government health care but fail to sign up their children separately are partly to blame for the drop in children's Medicaid coverage, a top legislative budget said Tuesday, much to the chagrin of some lawmakers who blame the agency itself. State lawmakers and social services officials held a hearing to address continued concerns about the recent dip in children receiving government health insurance. Between January 2018 and December 2019, roughly 100,000 children lost coverage through the program. Rep. David Wood, who leads the budget committee on social services, said during the hearing that between 2014 and 2018 the state didn't adequately check whether Medicaid recipients met eligibility requirements. After heightened efforts beginning in 2018 to purge Medicaid rolls of people who are not eligible, Wood said families began dropping out of the program. He said some didn't reapply for their children to be covered separately, even if their kids likely would have qualified. “When those individuals were notified that they were no longer eligible for Medicaid, we can assume that most of them did not go ahead and apply directly for their children to be under Medicaid,” the Versailles Republican said. Wood said the state needs to do a better job streamlining the application processes, notifying Missourians about changes in the health care coverage and answering participants' questions. But he also said it's ultimately up to parents to fill out the paperwork to ensure their children still have health insurance. “There is a certain amount of parent responsibility and individual responsibility to know what is available and fill out those applications,” he said. “It’s not the government’s...

 Okay, first things first. I don't like debt of any kind. I don't really like borrowing for a house, but I'm not unreasonable. I tolerate mortgage loans, as long as people use a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage, with payments that are no more than a fourth of their monthly take-home pay. A house is often the largest purchase in a person's life, and one most people can't achieve based solely on saving. I still recommend, however, setting aside as much as possible for a down payment before taking out a mortgage.
 Here's the thing. Cars go down in value, while traditional homes generally increase in value substantially over the years. Plus, you can get a great, pre-owned car for $10,000 to $15,000. This is an amount which, in my mind, is doable over the course of several months through determined saving and living on a budget. Depending on where you live, a good home can cost 10 to 20 times that much.
 The best way to build wealth and have a secure financial life is to stay away from debt. This means getting out of mortgage debt as quickly as possible, too. You're never going to win with money if you can't learn to delay pleasure.
 Everyone has that little kid inside them, and that little kid wants everything he or she wants right now. Your husband is asking a normal question, but he's dangerously close to letting that immature little kid out. It happens to all of us once in a while, but we have to grow to a point as adults where we tell that little kid no!

The home of Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward was attacked with flares and graffiti on Tuesday night by a mob of disgruntled supporters.
 Woodward has been a target of offensive chanting by United fans in recent matches due to his role in the club's declining fortunes on the field over the past seven years.
 In a statement, United said: "We know that the football world will unite behind us as we work with Greater Manchester Police to identify the perpetrators of this unwarranted attack.
 "Anybody found guilty of a criminal offence or found to be trespassing on this property will be banned for life by the club and may face prosecution.
 "Fans expressing opinion is one thing, criminal damage and intent to endanger life is another. There is imply no excuse for this."
 A video released on social media showed a flare being thrown over the gate to Woodward's Cheshire home.
 According to the Daily Mirror the attack was carried out by a group of 20-30 balaclava-clad United fans.
