A concept site plan for the Millstone Landing 7-Eleven store in Lexington Park was approved with a split vote by the St. Mary’s County Planning Commission at a meeting on Monday, despite concerns of increased traffic.
 The hearing regarding the proposed connivence store was continued from Sept. 14, when representatives of the applicant were asked to provide additional traffic information to the commission before the floor was opened for public comment.
 Mike Riemann, a representative for the Becker Morgan Group, reminded the board the store would be located at the corner of Millstone Landing Road and Three Notch Road, where a Golden Corral restaurant, which recently closed, is located.
 “There were questions about road improvements. We conducted a traffic study and submitted that for review,” Riemann said. The State Highway Administration expressed concern with the double left turn lane queuing from Route 235 onto Millstone Landing Road, “so we’re lengthening those left turn lanes by at least 50 feet as part of this project,” which will allow enough room for the stacking of cars turning onto the road, he said.
 Howard Thompson, chair of the planning commission, pointed out the traffic study was conducted in June of 2019 while kids were not attending school and noted buses could impact traffic patterns, but Betty Tustin, a traffic engineer from The Traffic Group, said COVID-19 is preventing them from conducting another study.
 Another member of the planning commission, Joesph Van Kirk, said according to the traffic study the proposed convenience store would create “four times the traffic using those failing intersections,” but Tustin replied while the study shows about 4,000 daily trips on the road, 75% of them are already driving through, regardless of the placement of the 7-Eleven.
 During public comment, St. Mary’s County Commissioner Todd Morgan (R), who is also a resident of Millstone Landing Road, called in to air his worries about the proposed store. The commissioner’s wife, Maria Morgan, died 16 months after sustaining injuries in a July 2011 car crash at the Millstone Landing Road intersection.
 “Traffic along that road is terrible,” he said, adding, traffic studies are paid for by the client so they “generally meet client’s objectives at the end of the day.”
 After discussing a few more concerns, the planning commission voted to approve the store on the condition the applicant complete all road improvements required by the state, with Thompson, Van Kirk, and member Patricia Robrecht voting against.

Earlier this year, Ryan warned the county could face a multimillion budget shortfall due to the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, the county instituted a hiring and spending freeze, and offered retirement incentives to employees. The also is a proposal to draw $1.3 million from the county's special tax stabilization fund.
 Legislature Minority Leader Ken Ronk said he was "wholly and totally opposed" to the 2% pay cut.
 "I don't think you handle tough times by taking away from these employees," said Ronk, R-Wallkill.
 Ronk said he would consider amendments that would eliminate some proposed pay raises, job title changes and increases in hours.
 "There are several raises listed that I don't agree with, but there are several that I do," Ronk said, noting there are many employees working "harder and longer" as a result of the retirement incentive that culled 125 employees from the county workforce.
 Legislature Chairman David Donaldson, D-Kingston, said increasing employee hours is a "slippery slope" that has been used to give employees pay raises.
 Reached after the committee meeting, Ryan said the "very small increases" proposed in his plan are the result of employees being asked to take on additional duties."
 Ryan said even with the proposed increases, the county still is realizing overall savings as a result of defunding more than 120 positions. In the Finance Department alone, he said, the 2021 budget eliminates funding for five positions for a savings of more than $400,000 in salaries and benefits. To compensate for some of that lost productivity, Ryan said, his budget calls for a five-hour increase in another employee's workweek, with a corresponding increase in pay.
 "While one individual is working more hours and is therefore being paid more, it's still a savings overall of hundreds of thousands of dollars," he said.
 The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to meet at 1 p.m. Thursday to discuss additional budget amendments and is expected to vote on the proposed changes at a meeting scheduled for 4 p.m. Tuesday.

After rags and tools were found in many of the grounded aircraft, the FAA is also ordering inspections to look for such debris left behind during manufacturing. Partially as a result of lapses such as this, the FAA is using its own inspectors to sign off on the safety of newly built planes. It had been routine for Boeing employees to conduct such approvals.
 Originally one of the chief selling points for the plane was that pilots trained to fly on the previous family of 737s, known as Next Generation, wouldn’t have to complete costly simulator training before transitioning to the Max.
 Now, every pilot will have to undergo simulator training on the Max, including how to handle issues that arose during the crashes.
 For Boeing, which faces at least $20 billion in Max-related costs, the crisis became one of the worst in the company’s century-long history.
 Several senior executives were forced out, including then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg.
 Now, with the collapse in air travel, airlines that had been clamoring for the more-efficient Boeing jets suddenly are fighting for survival and looking to postpone deliveries. Executives warned last month that the company will burn more cash than it generates until 2022 and that it will take at least a year beyond that to clear the mothballed Max aircraft out of its inventory.
 "No one needs any jets for growth and the market is going to stay very soft for a number of years,” industry analyst Aboulafia said.
 How consumers respond to the airplane is also uncertain. John Mowry, managing director with Alton Aviation Consultancy, said the company has begun to refer to the jet by its model number, such as the 737-8, more frequently in press releases — perhaps a sign that over time the Max brand will eventually go away.
 "I don’t know if it will be some big, splashy rebranding or if the Max name will just slip into oblivion,” Mowry said in an interview prior to the FAA’s announcement.

He installed windows and about halfway through, it would go to a black screen. We cleared CMOS and re-seated the GPU and ram. Then I noticed he was using a 550W psu from Corsair, I looked up the manufacturer GPU specs and they reccomended a 650W, so I ordered him a new one so he could send back his with minimal downtime (not that it was running anyway). Got new PSU and it seemed to be stable, he got online and updated the drivers, we updated the bios for the motherboard and it seemed fine then randomly black screens. He was watching a video and it did it, but the sound kept playing, so I don't think the system is crashing. He also noted that the fans on the GPU go to max after black screen, and then stop.

The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a measure that would tighten FAA’s authority over employees at Boeing and other manufacturers who are deputized by the agency to sign off on designs, among other reforms. A Senate committee is considering a similar bill on Wednesday.
 The 737 Max, an update of previous 737 models with more fuel-efficient engines, was grounded in the U.S. on March 13, 2019, three days after the Ethiopian plane went down.
 Just as in an Oct. 29, 2018, crash on a Lion Air flight in the Java Sea near Jakarta, an automated flight-control feature known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System activated during a malfunction. MCAS, which was designed to nudge the nose down in rare flight conditions, repeatedly dove the planes until pilots lost control.
 The two crashes killed 346 people. A diver working on the undersea wreckage near Indonesia also died.
 Boeing and the FAA have settled on several changes to MCAS to ensure it can’t cause another crash. The system will only activate once. If it is triggered, its ability to dive is limited so that pilots can still control the plane manually. And, instead of being activated by a single sensor, it will only function if two sensors agree it’s needed.
 Pilots weren’t initially told that the system existed because Boeing concluded that they could easily disable it using an emergency procedure that had been in place for decades and was required to be memorized at some airlines.
 However, the underlying sensor failure that triggered MCAS in both cases also prompted confusing additional warnings and loud alerts in the cockpit. The FAA and Boeing had issued instructions for how to handle such a failure after the first accident, yet the Ethiopian crew wasn’t able to do so.
 Indonesian crash investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded Boeing and the FAA shouldn’t have assumed that pilots would quickly recognize how to respond.
 In addition to MCAS, the FAA is also requiring numerous other changes to the plane after a torturous review process that at times prompted tension between the planemaker and its overseer, as well as foreign regulators.
 Regulators required Boeing to complete a complex update to the Max’s flight- control computers so that they are more redundant. Changes were also mandated for the plane’s autopilot and wiring has to be rerouted to limit the risks it could cause a failure similar to what was seen in the crashes.

Soros earned a lot of it, but it's what he chose to do with his wealth that has led to his vilification by the likes of Bill O'Reilly, Alex Jones and Steve Bannon, all shown citing Soros as a shadowy puppet master. Specifically, Soros has used his billions to support causes in which he believes -- initially working against Communism behind the scenes -- calling himself "a political philanthropist" and adding, "I'm happy that I irritate some people."
 As allies note, Soros stands apart from much of the conservative billionaire donor class not just because of his political bent, but the fact that while he acknowledges using money to magnify his voice, he doesn't do so to benefit his interests directly.
 If there's a down side to the film, it's that "Soros" probably doesn't devote enough time to the way its subject has become a favorite bogeyman to conservatives that paint him as the guiding hand behind grassroots campaigns by those intent on discrediting them.

 “Within 20-30 minutes of the announcement we were like, let’s get creative,” Ramler said. “Do we do more carryout food?”
 To help ease the strain on small businesses, the state is offering the opportunity to apply for a $10,000 grant that was provided by the CARES Act.
 “It sure as heck won’t be a typical holiday season as a bar or restaurant,” Ramler said. “But it’ll help stop the bleeding. Help us make the payments. Help keep staff on.”
 Restaurants owned by publicly traded companies or businesses with at least 50% of sales via drive-thru traffic won't be eligible for the CARES Act grant, but local chains with more than one location will be eligible to receive up to $20,000 in aid. Applications are set to open Nov. 30, and they will be processed in the order they are received.

As CNN noted in a 2018 profile, Soros' Jewish heritage, wealth and politics have fueled conspiracy theories, with his enemies frequently labeling him a "globalist," plotting to undermine US sovereignty. In one clip in the documentary, a C-SPAN caller parrots lies about Soros' collaboration with the Nazis back to him, underscoring how such disinformation can take hold.
 "Soros" addresses and debunks those assertions, but in a way that feels a bit too much like simply waving them off. Then again, the prevailing sense is if Soros didn't exist, Fox News and talk radio would have had to invent him.
 Great wealth "gives you a degree of power," Soros admits, and he has clearly leveraged that to pursue the change that he seeks, not just in the US but around the world.
 If nothing else, "Soros" helps demystify the man and what motivates him, separating the myth from reality. In an age where money talks louder than ever in politics, it's worth clearly understanding what Soros has tried to say with his.
  _"Soros" is offering a live streaming premiere on Nov. 18 and will be available on demand beginning Nov. 20._

But the situation will almost certainly get worse this winter, when the city’s pension board decides how much San Diego’s annual pension payment must increase in the new fiscal year.
 The payment will spike at least $24 million because of a new longevity study showing city retirees are living longer, which increases the number of years they will receive pension payments.

A few tables over, Steve Spirkoff sipped a beer six feet from his neighbors, but still close enough to chat.
 While sitting out in the parking lot was less than ideal, Spirkoff said he still wanted to show up and support a place he has been visiting, off and on, for many years.
 “I just like it out here, and I don’t want to see these places go away,” Spirkoff said. “You know, if you go to a bar in La Jolla or somewhere down by the beach, you meet a lot of plastic people pretending to be something that they’re not. But here, you meet the real people of East County being just who they are.”
 Technically, bars are only able to remain open during the pandemic if they also serve food. While Don’s did have a menu posted, and has a relationship with a pizza restaurant, few were doing anything more than drinking Wednesday afternoon.

“I completely lost my cool with the officer,” she said. “I am lucky he didn’t arrest me for what I said. I asked him how he slept at night or how he could look at himself in the mirror, knowing he put this disabled young man out in the cold with literally no regard for his well-being.”
 Her son stowed his tent in the bushes.
 “When he got back to where he put them, someone had taken his house.”
 Some people try camping on Bureau of Land Management property up Gooseneck Road.
 “That was the worst experience of my life,” Stlouis said. “It was like World War III with automatic weapons and explosions and gunfire around the clock. With the bullets ricocheting around us, I was in constant fear of my dog or me being shot. I tried walking out of there and didn’t get far before having to turn back because it was too far to make it to Dallas.”
 She said she wants people to understand that “the homeless” are human beings with names, faces and stories. However, she added, it’s hard for anyone to understand what homelessness is like unless they’re experiencing it.
 “I don’t know if there are words that could ever describe being homeless,” Stlouis said. “I never thought I would be one of those people, yet here I am. Misery and suffering have become commonplace.”
 Jill at Wallace Marine Park said people keep looking for a solution to homelessness, but there’s isn’t one single solution.
