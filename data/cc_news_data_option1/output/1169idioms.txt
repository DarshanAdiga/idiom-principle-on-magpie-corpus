Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will hold telephone talks with International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach later Tuesday, the government said, as doubts swirl over the fate of the Tokyo 2020 Games.                                                                            The call, which was also expected to feature Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, organising committee chief Yoshiro Mori and Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto, was scheduled for around 8pm local time (1100 GMT).                                                                            The contact comes after the IOC gave itself four weeks to weigh a possible postponement to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics due to the new coronavirus pandemic surging across the world.                                                                            Canada and Australia have already withdrawn their teams and the influential US Olympic committee has also said postponement was the best way forward.                                                                            Despite coming under increasing pressure, IOC officials believe a decision would be "premature" four months from the scheduled opening ceremony on July 24.                                                                            Abe has said he is committed to hosting a "complete" Olympics but admitted for the first time on Monday: "If that becomes difficult, in light of considering athletes first, it may become inevitable that we make a decision to postpone."

China will lift restrictions on movement in most areas of Hubei province on Wednesday, ending a lockdown of the area brought on by the coronavirus.                                                            People who are cleared will be able to leave the province after midnight on Tuesday.                                                            Restrictions on the hardest-hit city of Wuhan will remain until April 8.                                                            China barred people from leaving or entering Wuhan and the wider province on January 23 as Covid-19 began spreading to the rest of China and overseas during the Lunar New Year holiday, when many Chinese travel.                                                            Hubei has had almost no new infections for more than a week.                                                            The move to end the lockdown shows the authorities’ apparent faith in the success of the drastic measures in much of China.                                                            After barring people from leaving or entering Wuhan, authorities swiftly expanded what were, at the time, unprecedented measures to most of Hubei and its tens of millions of residents, as well as many other parts of a country with a population of 1.4 billion.                                                            It remains unclear, however, whether other cities and provinces, such as the capital Beijing, will allow people leaving Hubei to enter their jurisdictions. Quarantine rules are expected to remain in place for those travelling outside their local areas.                                                            Officials have now largely turned their attention to the threat of the virus returning from abroad, with almost all new cases being recorded among passengers travelling in from overseas.                                                            Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities have ordered mandatory 14-day quarantines for all returnees, mainly in hotels and other government-designated locations where those staying must pay their own way.                                                            Exceptions are allowed in some cases, including for those living alone, who must quarantine themselves at home.                                                            In a move to slam the door on the crisis, starting on Wednesday, Beijing will also require everyone arriving from overseas to be tested for the coronavirus in addition to being quarantined.                                                            In a notice published online on Tuesday, Beijing city authorities said those who have entered the capital within the last 14 days will also undergo mandatory testing.                                                            “Currently, the imported risk from the epidemic’s rapid spread overseas continues to rise,” said the notice.                                                            China’s National Health Commission reported 78 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, among which 74 were imported.                                                            At the same time, the government is pushing efforts to kick-start the world’s second-largest economy and put money in the pockets of workers who have gone weeks without salaries.                                                            While most of Beijing’s world-famous tourist sites remain closed, parts of the Great Wall have reopened and some restaurants are reopening for business on the condition that customers do not sit facing each other.                                                            The government says work has restarted on about 90% of major public construction projects across the country, excluding Hubei.                                                            While many migrant workers remain trapped by travel bans, industrial production has also restarted, including in the crucial car manufacturing industry, which is largely based in Wuhan, and in businesses that provide critical links in global supply chains.

Le restrizioni adottate poche ore fa dalla Regione e poi dal Governo – prosegue Tassone - per contenere i flussi straordinari non saranno risolutive. Certo potranno impedire l’ulteriore crescita della curva del contagio, ma non è abbastanza. Il mese scorso abbiamo assistito a tre grandi ondate di rientro, che avrebbero meritato allora un controllo maggiore rispetto alla semplice autodenuncia. Il momento delle dichiarazioni sulla stampa sta terminando, insieme ai tempi utili per rendere operativa una struttura tale da gestire l’eventuale aggravarsi del quadro. Adesso la priorità è mettere medici e infermieri nelle condizioni di poter lavorare in sicurezza. Questo è il messaggio che proviene da più parti del territorio, da ordini professionali, amministratori e personale sanitario».

Writing a book about this monumental insanity, I continued investigating. And In a process I got attacked, as almost anyone who visits Borneo does, by various and vicious parasites. My guts got infected by something terrible, and then my eyes. I flew between Balikpapan and Pontianak on Lion Air’s Boeing 737 (yes, that Lion Air, which keeps cramming and periodically crashing planes, ever since the beginning of its operation). I have no idea whether my eyes got attacked there, on board, or in some filthy ditch near the palm oil plantations, where they are cutting down what is left of the tropical forest.

HARRIS: Indeed, there does. The president seems to be getting impatient with the huge impact of this public - these public health measures, and he's now promising that things will be over sooner than we think. He's very unspecific about when exactly that might be, but he also says the decision will be based on science. And that's where the conflict comes along because the emerging idea in public health science is that it's going to take quite a while to bring this under control. It's going to get harder before it gets easier. The emerging idea - and maybe this is - in the long run, this could happen is if they can identify places where the disease is absent or under control, health officials will be able to relax the restrictions. That's kind of what happened in South Korea. But there, they had massive testing programs...

For the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects its total revenues to be between RMB490 million (US$70 million) and RMB540 million (US$78 million). This amount has reflected the fact that LiveMe's revenues will no longer be included in the Company's revenues. The above outlook is based on the current market conditions and reflects the Company's preliminary estimates, which are all subject to change, particularly in light of the uncertainties related to how COVID-19 develops.

The first season of _Westworld_ was notorious for unfolding in two different timelines without giving the audience an explicit heads up. The second season upped the ante (and potentially, the confusion) by adding a third, tormented perspective. One might expect _Westworld_ season 3 to go for broke in the timeline department, but after the premiere episode — and overt clarification that what we’re watching takes place only months after the Delos Parks incident — it would seem creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan have dialed down the galaxy brain storytelling.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (WJLA/CNN) - A doctor at George Washington University Hospital wants everyone to know exactly how COVID-19 can damage your lungs.He created a virtual rendering of lungs from an actual patient being treated at the hospital, and he thinks it has a powerful message for the public.“So we can see it front to back, side to side...” said Dr. Keith Mortman,chief of thoracic surgery. “This patient is a gentleman in his late 50s, who initially had a fever and a non-productive cough like many other people. Respiratory symptoms progressed quite rapidly, to the point where he did need to be intubated and put on the ventilator."A virtual reality, 360-degree rendering, shows exactly what the virus does to the human body.“So what you’re seeing in the video, essentially the blue part is the more normal lung, but anything you’re seeing yellow is lung that’s being destroyed by the virus,” Mortman said.In partnership with a company called Surgical Theater, he used a coronavirus patient’s CAT scan to create an interactive model.“It’s quite alarming to see, in all honesty, because unlike your garden-variety pneumonia that might affect only one small part of the lung or unlike the common flu, what you’re seeing in this video is really the widespread, diffuse damage to the lung.”Mortman’s hope is that the technology can help medical professionals on the front lines, but he also wants members of the public to see these images for themselves.This perspective should open everyone’s eyes to the dangers of COVID-19, he said.“I really want them to be able to see this and to really understand the damage that’s being done to the lungs, the severity of the disease that this is causing, so perhaps, maybe they think twice before having a house party or going outside to large groups,” Mortman said.He said COVID-19 is a community problem, and it’s going to take a community effort to solve it.Copyright 2020 WJLA via CNN.

Ten of the 14 Italian tourists who were undergoing treatment, after testing positive to Covid-19, at Medanta Hospital in Gurugram were discharged on Monday after testing negative in the second confirmatory test. One patient was discharged on Saturday, while one tested positive in the second confirmatory test. Two are still undergoing treatment. The patients were shifted to Medanta Hospital from the quarantine facility of the Indo- Tibetan Border Police on March 4.Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman and managing director, Medanta Hospital tells Archana Mishra about the treatment and the processes involved.What was the line of treatment adopted by the hospital to cure the Covid-19 patients?They were in isolation and treated symptomatically. The whole credit goes to our staff, who took excellent care of them, looking after their medical, food and housekeeping needs, although, we were worried as they were equally getting exposed to it. The outcome shows we could treat them as well as anybody in the world. The results are excellent. The remaining three patients are also recovering and they might leave in the next few days. What worked for these patients?They are all older people, who are most vulnerable to the disease. As the treatment went along and we saw a deteriorating health condition, we gave them a combination of antiviral drugs, like HIV drugs, and used chloroquine selectively. It was tailored for them daily, after studying their symptomology and diagnostic findings. If anybody was showing congestion in the lungs, we would add more antiviral medicines to prevent further deterioration of health. A lot of data has come out in this process. Now, we are collating the data as this is the first proof of the patients being treated in one place. This would help us with future treatments. Considering the increasing number of confirmed cases, how important is the public-private partnership (PPP) in the health sector?If there is ever a time that PPP is needed the most, this is it. Today, we are facing a massive burden, with difficulty in even gauging the gravity of it. If it hits India with the intensity with which it has hit other countries, we could face an unprecedented problem. It is for this reason that the public and private sectors have to work in tandem. We have to pool the resources as there are not enough in India. We don't have enough beds, critical care beds, ventilators, paramedical equipment and we don't have enough trained manpower to take care of patients. Our experience and ability to treat these patients puts us in a stronger position. The cost of treatment, however, is huge. So, we hope to limit the cases by imposing lockdown, breaking the chain by identifying infected people, isolating and treating them. We don't have a radar right now. All we know is that the curve is going higher. In the current situation, we are noticing a shift from patient-centred treatment to community-centred treatment. Where do you see it going from here? This has been a learning process for us. These 14 people have helped us to sensitise our people. Certain fears have been mitigated because we can say we can take care of them without the hospital staff getting infected. This has been proved. The private sector has been allowed to conduct the test for coronavirus. Will it be possible for the private sector to do free testing? Everybody should do their bit and conduct free tests for those who can't afford it.

Okaloosa Schools Superindent Marcus Chambers shared the following update with parents:                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The week of March 23rd will be a busy week for our schools in Okaloosa County. As parents, you will receive several important notifications through email, social media, and call outs.  The goal for this week is to provide our students and parents with the necessary information as we all transition into this new normal of online instruction. I will also be sending out a document and a video later this week that will provide some guidance for parents on online education.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Additionally, we will be providing approximately 17,000 devices to students and families beginning this Tuesday, March 24th.  While we do not currently have enough devices to hand one out for each of the 32,000 students in our district, we have enough to ensure that all students who are in need will receive one. It is important to note that elementary students will be issued an IPad and secondary students will be issued a laptop. What does this mean for you and your child(ren)? If you currently have an IPad or a laptop, we ask that you use your device to allow our students without an IPad or laptop the ability to receive one. At this time, we are only disbursing one device per family; however, we have purchased more devices and have a plan in place to deploy second devices once we have ensured each family that needs a laptop or an IPad has received one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "You have likely seen information posted on social media from your child's school on the protocols and procedures for picking up a device. It is vital for everyone's health that you follow the guidelines each school has in place for deploying devices. Each school's procedure follows CDC guidelines for crowds and social distancing. Knowing that, please understand that picking up devices will take time, so please be prepared to wait in your car until it is your turn to receive a device. Your patience and understanding during this process is appreciated!                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Since this is a new normal for everyone, I want to be transparent in this transition to online education. While we are prepared for this new model of instruction, I want all parents to know that, as with anything new, there will be bumps in this process. However, just like education in a traditional school setting, it is imperative that you work with your child's teacher and principal as they quickly work to remedy any issues you may face. Communication will be key to making this work in the best way for you and your child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "My message to our teachers and principals during this time has been to handle situations with compassion and grace. While I want our teachers and principals to work with compassion and grace in their hearts, I also ask that each of you handle your new normal with compassion and grace. Helping your children navigate the waters of this new normal might be, at times, uncomfortable. I ask that you treat yourselves, your children, and their teachers with grace and compassion. Allow mistakes. Learn from them knowing that our entire community will come out much stronger than we have ever been. I am confident that this new model will serve your children well until we can reunite back in our physical schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "In addition to preparing for the online education model, we have been working on expanding our Feeding Program.  Last week we provided over 1,200 meals a day, and we expect that number will rise in the weeks to come.  To prepare for that, we will be adding feeding sites across the district beginning March 25th. Moreover, we will be expanding the use of busses to deliver food to bus stops for families who cannot get to feeding sites. More information will come out on Monday regarding the additional school sites and bus stop locations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "For parents who have high school aged children, we know that you have many questions.  Please be sure to reach out to your child's teachers, guidance counselor, and administrators, as they will be able to help. Unfortunately, some questions still do not have answers as only time can tell. I can assure you that as we are provided guidance and timelines, I will share them. While I recognize that many of you are still left questioning the viability of prom, athletic events, field trips, honors programs and more, I can only say that these events are currently cancelled until further notice. While AP and IB have announced their solutions to the 2019-2020 testing situation, we still await word from AICE about their solution to testing.  Simply put, we are all doing our best to give high school students the "experience" they expect from high school while in the midst of a pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "As it pertains to graduation for the Senior Class of 2020, only time will tell whether we will be able to celebrate this monumental occasion at the end of May. What I can assure you is that we will have a graduation for our seniors. They have worked too hard for this moment and we will not deprive them- or you- of this. While I might not be able to tell you what graduation will look like, I can tell you it will happen.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "I fully understand that these are uncertain times. As your Superintendent, I simply cannot express how proud I am of our teachers, staff, and administrators who have worked throughout Spring Break to ensure the best educational environment for your child. Similarly, there have been those behind the scenes, the district staff, who have worked tirelessly to support our schools with the goal of resuming instruction on March 30th. This has been no small feat, and yet all parties came together to guarantee that your children's educational goals were not stopped in the face of a global pandemic. Finally, I am beyond proud of the students who are dealing with this historic change that has upended the routine of their lives. While some students have mentioned their hesitation to begin this new normal, some have been excited to continue their education at home while staying healthy. Regardless of the emotion, I am so proud of each of our students and I say to each of you… we will get through this together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Parents, please stay tuned for the information you will receive this week and thank you from the bottom of my heart for your encouraging messages, prayers and support.  Okaloosa is the best because of the community we live in and I am thankful!

Some have attributed Japan’s relatively low case rate to its culture of cleanliness, wherein children are taught from a young age to consistently wash their hands, and wearing masks is a fact of life even outside of flu season.

A falta de confirmación oficial, ya se conoce el primer caso de coronavirus en Utrera, se trata de un militar profesional que presta sus servicios en el acuartelamiento la Borbolla de Sevilla, perteneciente al Ejército de Tierra.Este militar residente en Utrera desde hace varios años, comenzó el pasado martes, según el mismo ha confirmado, a sentirse mal, por lo que fue remitido a su casa para que permaneciese en aislamiento , ya que su estado con dolor muscular y articular, fiebre de entre 37,5 y 38,5 y malestar general junto a tos seca, coincidía plenamente con los síntomas del COVID-19, y más después de saber que en dicho acuartelamiento se hablaba de algún caso con el que había tenido contacto indirecto, aunque ninguno confirmado hasta el suyo propio de la mañana de hoy.Ha sido casi una semana de incertidumbre y de apenas contacto físico con su familia, ya que al no estar grave ni ser grupo de riesgo, no podía ir al hospital ni hacerse las pruebas pertinentes, hasta esta misma semana, concretamente hasta ayer domingo que aunque la fiebre le había bajado sí seguía con el malestar general e incluso notó problemas respiratorios por lo que decidió, al ver también a su familia algo afectada, ir a la clínica Quirón de Sevilla donde le hicieron unas placas, un análisis de sangre y le diagnosticaron una pequeña neumonía en los pulmones por lo que decidieron, según los síntomas, dejarlo ingresado y realizarle la prueba del COVID-19.Los resultados se han recibido en la mañana de hoy y siendo declarado positivo, aunque debido a que su estado no es grave, está a la espera del alta médica para pasar la cuarentena en casa, con un protocolo a cumplir para evitar contagios, aunque tanto a su mujer como a los hijos, que ya están en contacto con el SAS, imaginamos que se les va a realizar las pruebas pertinentes.El alcalde de Utrera, José María Villalobos, ha hablado sobre este caso en sus redes sociales “este momento tenía que llegar. Ahora más que nunca os pido que conservemos la serenidad y la calma y confiemos en el nuestro sistema sanitario y sus profesionales. El mejor servicio a los demás es quedarse en casa”, ha comentado.

As a rule, it's advised that you activate your TV's Game Mode while you're playing games. You may not notice a difference straight away, but by eliminating some of your TV's processes, Game Mode generally ensures you're getting as little input lag as possible. It's particularly important for online or competitive games such as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Fortnite, or Mortal Kombat 11, where milliseconds can make a surprising difference.

The amount of Bells each tree gives varies, depending on how much you bury back into the glowing hole. If you bury 2,000 Bells, each bag on the tree will have 2,000 Bells, totaling 6,000 Bells. Based on our testing, the value of the three Bell bags on the trees caps out at 10,000 Bells each. This means you can only get 30,000 Bells total from each tree. The most you should put in the hole is 10,000 Bells to maximize profit.

The marvelous details go a long way toward making up for the plot’s winding sins. Captain Nemo’s ship The Nautilus is the coolest submarine in (fictional) existence. As a long, white ship covered with silver detailing, it lives up to Nemo’s name for it: “the sword of the ocean.” (The inside of the ship is designed in much the same way.) The way the film pulls off the transformation between Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is also thrilling; parts of Jekyll grow at different rates, so muscles bulge unevenly all over his body. It’s horrifying to watch, and pulled off between cuts and flashes of smoke that obscure each new addition of prosthetics. It’s clearly a painful process, exacerbated by the taxing nature of having two minds in one head, which itself is neatly illustrated by the conversations Jekyll and Hyde have via mirrors.

A mere 15 days could make or break America’s response to the Coronavirus. This administration’s early restrictions on travel from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and the rest of Mainland China delayed the onset of self-sustaining Coronavirus outbreaks in the United States for weeks after they became a reality in other Western nations, and the subsequent ban on travel from Europe bought us additional time. As things stand, America’s is doing everything in its power to keep numbers as low as possible.
 In order to keep it that way, we need to follow the White House guidelines by staying at home to the greatest extent possible and practicing social distancing and rigorous hygiene when we are forced to go out in public.

I am going to once again go over one of the most difficult challenges in today's investment climate: maintaining a reality check on your fears.                                                                                                                                                                                                Given the performance of the markets recently, it is no surprise that many investors have suddenly had to come to terms with the potential perils of investing and the unpredictability of market returns.                                                                                                                                                                                                It has been more than a month since the S&P; 500 has managed to rally on consecutive days. Still, there remains some evidence that markets continue to function, and if you can just hold in there then today's brutal dislocation will be tomorrow's opportunity.                                                                                                                                                                                                Say this for the Fed, they have not been afraid to act quickly. It seems that a new program or two is unveiled almost every day. They may be fighting the last war, but you cannot accuse them of not deploying heavy artillery.                                                                                                                                                                                                In truth, some of what we are seeing play out in recent days represents the hangover for a decade-plus of easy money. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. It seems clear is that there are already some interesting opportunities for those prepared to take on a degree of liquidity risk. In addition, you need to be mentally prepared for some grim data to emerge in the coming weeks and months.                                                                                                                                                                                                Next week's jobless-claims number will likely chalk up a record high. Some of the quarterly GDP forecasts out there for Q2 are less than what we would hope for. In a sense it is war and the coronavirus as humanity's common enemy.                                                                                                                                                                                                It is likely that the financial markets will plateau before the economic data indicates a light at the end of the tunnel. Therefore, you need to be mentally and financially prepared for a lot of "sticker shock" data points over an indefinite period.                                                                                                                                                                                                Hopefully policymakers are making the right moves and thereby building a foundation for an eventual recovery. It's too soon to trade that view now, but by the same token it's probably too late to panic.                                                                                                                                                                                                Meanwhile, businesses are shuttering, and borders are locking up. The virus has the world on a virtual standstill. And a rapid decline in forecasts for the global economy and corporate earnings has broken the bull market for stocks and ushered in a bout of volatility not seen since the Great Depression.                                                                                                                                                                                                The S&P; 500 has moved an average 7.7% in the past seven sessions, and on Monday, the index saw its worst day in three decades. So, is any corporation doing well in this maelstrom?                                                                                                                                                                                                Walmart (WMT) appears better positioned than most to be able to cope with the coronavirus pandemic                                                                                                                                                                                                Anxious shoppers are hoarding everyday goods and non-essential stores are shuttered. The coronavirus pandemic presents a never-before-seen crisis for retailers. Yet, Walmart appears better prepared to deal with it than its peers.                                                                                                                                                                                                Hefty investment in e-commerce, health care and its 1.5-million strong workforce have the world's largest retailer poised to supply large swaths of the nation as governments and other businesses grapple to respond to the unprecedented threat.                                                                                                                                                                                                Rival Amazon.com stands to benefit as well, but Walmart can leverage its store network and clout with suppliers to gain a leg up.                                                                                                                                                                                                Even so, the challenge of stocking the nation amid a run on essential goods will be a stern test, even for an operation on Walmart's scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                Walmart prides itself on crisis management. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, Walmart's truckers shuttled bottled water, diapers and socks to displaced residents -- often before the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed up.                                                                                                                                                                                                When the Great Recession crimped consumer spending, Walmart's low prices and wide assortment made it ideal for those trading down and cocooning at home.                                                                                                                                                                                                Note that Walmart can act only because of embracing radical change to its business model. These changes span across the company but are most evident in its market-leading online grocery business.                                                                                                                                                                                                Walmart has spent the past five years aggressively expanding that service, in part to provide a bulwark against Amazon's dominance of most other areas of online shopping. Now, that investment could pay off as coronavirus-conscious consumers, stuck at home, eschew brick-and-mortar stores for the web.                                                                                                                                                                                                -- Lauren Rudd is a financial writer and columnist.

WASHINGTON, D.C. (WJLA/CNN) - A doctor at George Washington University Hospital wants everyone to know exactly how COVID-19 can damage your lungs.He created a virtual rendering of lungs from an actual patient being treated at the hospital, and he thinks it has a powerful message for the public.“So we can see it front to back, side to side...” said Dr. Keith Mortman,chief of thoracic surgery. “This patient is a gentleman in his late 50s, who initially had a fever and a non-productive cough like many other people. Respiratory symptoms progressed quite rapidly, to the point where he did need to be intubated and put on the ventilator."A virtual reality, 360-degree rendering, shows exactly what the virus does to the human body.“So what you’re seeing in the video, essentially the blue part is the more normal lung, but anything you’re seeing yellow is lung that’s being destroyed by the virus,” Mortman said.In partnership with a company called Surgical Theater, he used a coronavirus patient’s CAT scan to create an interactive model.“It’s quite alarming to see, in all honesty, because unlike your garden-variety pneumonia that might affect only one small part of the lung or unlike the common flu, what you’re seeing in this video is really the widespread, diffuse damage to the lung.”Mortman’s hope is that the technology can help medical professionals on the front lines, but he also wants members of the public to see these images for themselves.This perspective should open everyone’s eyes to the dangers of COVID-19, he said.“I really want them to be able to see this and to really understand the damage that’s being done to the lungs, the severity of the disease that this is causing, so perhaps, maybe they think twice before having a house party or going outside to large groups,” Mortman said.He said COVID-19 is a community problem, and it’s going to take a community effort to solve it.Copyright 2020 WJLA via CNN.

Caledonia County Superior Court Judge Michael J. Harris has denied a request to have three detainees released from jail due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak behind bars.                                                            “The current situation does not fall within the lack of adequate medical care cases,” wrote the judge in his entry order issued Monday morning. “These defendants at present have no imminent need for medical care. None of them require any medical attention for present symptoms or illness. None of them have any indication that they may develop COVID-19 symptoms in the near future from any exposure to contagious individuals.”

Now when you are looking at the specs, the phone is loaded with all the good things that you can hope from a flagship. You are getting the latest Snapdragon 865 SoC which does come with 5G, 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. However, Redmi also sells this phone with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.

un momento in cui tutti noi ci sentiamo confusi per la sospensione che la nostra quotidianita con le sue abitudini sta subendo. Le testimonianze che sentiamo, le notizie che arrivano, in aggiunta al non sapere quando termineranno questi giorni bui rende anche l'individuo piu granitico, un essere indifeso e irrequieto. Chi piu e chi meno e nella stessa barca per vincere sul virus. Ma, un periodo cosi complesso, come lo stanno vivendo le persone che soffrono di depressione? E come stanno reagendo, invece, coloro che hanno superato una malattia? Lo abbiamo chiesto alla dottoressa Tiziana Salvati, Psicoanalista, docente di Tecniche di Osservazione del Comportamento Infantile presso l'Universita Suor Orsola Benincasa di Napoli e Dottore di Ricerca presso il Dipartimento di Psichiatria e Neuropsichiatria Infantile delle Seconda Universita degli Studi di Napoli. La dottoressa Salvati ci ha chiarito cosa accade, parlando anche di chi e costretto a trascorrere la quarantena in una convivenza forzata e anche di chi sta ignorando la regola dello stare a casa, spiegandone le cause. Con lei abbiamo cercato di dare dei consigli, sperando che possano essere di aiuto per affrontare anche psicologicamente l'emergenza Coronavirus anche quando finira e si tornera, lentamente, a una normalita che, come si sa, non sara come quella di prima.

First up is a new fitness app codenamed “Seymour” and possibly to be called Fit or Fitness in its shipping form. It’s said to be a standalone app targeting iOS 14, watchOS 7, and tvOS 14, rather than a replacement for the current Activity app. The new app reportedly lets you download fitness videos with different workouts and activities that you can perform as the Apple Watch tracks your session, potentially expanding the types of exercise that the Watch is able to be used for.

The French government will not _" allow the flagships of our industry... to go up in smoke just because there is an economic crisis of a magnitude unprecedented since the 1929 Great Depression in the West,"_ Bruno Le Maire said in an interview with France Info on Tuesday.                                                            The minister was discussing ways French businesses can be assisted to traverse the economic slowdown aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic and what Paris is expecting from them. For example, he warned private companies to be careful with their dividend payments and called on the banks to show national solidarity and voluntarily allow struggling individuals to postpone their credit payments.                                                             _" We will need economic patriotism now more than ever,"_ he said.

Maeve wakes up with one of the same technicians she once tricked into giving her powers putting her body back together in the Westworld labs. Seems like the park is still up and running. The tech guy gives her the leeway to escape again, but she's overtaken by security. She's about to kill herself when Lee comes in and tells them she's just still in character from her most recent narrative, saving her once again. Plus, he has another way for her to find her daughter. And so it happens that Maeve, replaced in War World, says goodbye to Hector and heads off into the park with Lee to find the Forge and her daughter.

By last Thursday, the team behind the digital museum, Sarmaya, was already feeling a little boxed in. The eight-member team had been working from home since Monday and daily video-conference calls were becoming monotonous. "One colleague suggested we dress up as a historical character of our choice for the next call," says archive director Avehi Menon.With an hour's notice, the group cobbled together costumes, ending up as Frida Kahlo (unibrow and all), Salvador Dali (sporting a cut-out mustache), Amelia Earhart, Rosa Parks and other figures from history. "It was a lot of fun," says Menon. They spent the first 10 minutes of that 90-minute call enjoying everyone's looks.Artists, historians, and culture practitioners are finding creative ways to make the most of the stay-home measures deployed to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Alisha Sadikot, founder of the Inheritage Project, who leads heritage walks around Mumbai, knew that physical excursions -- the mainstay of her job -- would be impossible. Along with her neighbour and cousin, Sheena Khalid, a theatre professional and director, she put up an informal three-part video about the Bombay Plague of 1896 on Instagram last week. They discussed how another pandemic changed the city more than a century ago. "For us, it was a new way to share information," says Sadikot. "Not just the doom and gloom of a disease, but how the city responded to it by redesigning roads and neighbourhoods that form the best parts of Mumbai today."On Instagram, the handle @tussenkunstenquarantaine (between art and quarantine) has been posting images of people who've recreated classic paintings in their living room. Homebound folks have recreated The Great Wave off Kanagawa from toilet paper, The Night Watch from spice bottles and amber lighting, and The Scream by lying on a swirl of multicoloured laundry.Twitter handle @BigKitchenDisco claims to "take the edge off social distancing with some social disco dancing". It invites users to post videos of themselves dancing to the song of the day in their kitchens anywhere in the world, at 7pm. Artists are using hashtags like #IsolationCreation and #QuarantineArtClub to connect with others creating new art during enforced home time.British artist Gareth Fuller goes a step further. Staying home means he can't create the dense, detailed maps that characterise his work. So he took to mapping his home in quotidian but interesting detail. The series 14 Quarantine Maps shows a home transformed by constant occupation, the unravelling of order, and how spaces take on personalities of their own.Museums are using existing collections and exhibits to tell new stories too. On the social media handles of the Bhau Daji Lad Museum, century-old clay models (depicting local communities, occupations and team games) were assigned new duties. Photos depicted them practising social distancing, avoiding handshakes, public gatherings and touching their faces to reinforce the WHO's guidelines to avoid infection."Art is a great medium to engage with people at a time like this," says Menon. Sarmaya has released a series of digital folk-art stencils to engage their core audience of children and young adults. Sadikot believes that the arts allow for a break from the overwhelming buildup of news stories. "They allow you to address issues creatively." Menon stresses the need for artistic outlets like museums and archives to be accessible to the public, "Cultural organisations must ask audiences what they want, to stay relevant."Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter

The project received the New Zealand Institute of Architects Auckland Architecture Award (Heritage category) in 2009. In their citation, the judges noted: "For many years the value and significance of this wonderful building as the heart and soul of the Devonport community remained undervalued. The skill of the Salmond Reed team and Omega Trust has been to balance the heritage and art deco values of the building with the need to perform an ongoing commercial role within Devonport’s main street. They have achieved this with masterful success."

I grew up in Southern California neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly white — white schools, white teachers, white curriculum. I remember visiting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where a cast of _Auguste Rodin’s monumental sculpture of Balzac_ towered over me. My friends and I immersed ourselves in the works of white authors, and I can still recite vast sections of T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men,” William Butler Yeats’s “The Second Coming,” and, if I squeeze my eyes real tight, the final luxurious paragraphs of “The Dead,” James Joyce’s masterful short story.

The show’s second season will pick up from the events of the season one finale which saw Robyn’s work and home lives collide catastrophically when she could no longer resist the temptations of her myriad of addictions. She did manage to save Melody from the clutches of a group of dangerously ‘friendly’ footballers before firing her as the PR intern (for her own good) but closer relationships proved to be damaged beyond repair, and having been rejected by her sister and normal ‘last port in a storm’ Ruth, Robyn finally realised that she’d run out of road. Will Eve ever forgive Robyn, and on a broader scale, with Melody frozen out, will Mills Paulson PR ever be the same again? Caroline has bigger fish to fry in a shakeup that could change her business forever. Throughout all this the team continue to try their best to keep the outrageous indiscretions of their celebrity clients firmly behind closed doors.

The Gujarat government has decided to keep all schools closed and promote students of Classes 1 to 9 and 11 of the state board, as the annual exams this year could not be conducted due to the coronavirus crisis, officials said on Tuesday. The board exams for Classes 10 and 12 were already conducted by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board earlier this month.                                                                            However, the exams for other standards could not be conducted as schools were already closed by the government from March 15 to check the spread of coronavirus. The decision to promote the students to higher standards was taken by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, said Ashwani Kumar, secretary in the Chief Minister's Office.                                                                            "Since schools were asked to remain shut, the chief minister has decided to give mass promotion to students of Classes 1 to 9 and 11. This was necessary to keep the children safe," Kumar told reporters in Gandhinagar. The Gujarat government on Monday declared a statewide lockdown till the end of this month.

After episode 1, we still only know a few scant details about Caleb, but he’s returned to Los Angeles and seemingly clicked into a track based on the algorithmic life optimization of Incite Incorporated. Participants who sign up with Incite — which sounds like everyone on the planet, at this point — are judged by the all-seeing AI “Rehoboam” and given a set of marching orders that will, in theory, improve their life. Caleb is clearly unhappy with where he ended up, even if his construction-bot coworker never gives him guff, but he’s also optimistic he can change his fate through hard work. He tells Francis that he intends to “keep my scores up” and “see if something better comes along.” Francis tells him to “keep climbing.”

How are voters supposed to trust any future “ _progressive_ ” candidates after such turncoat maneuvers from not only Gabbard but Sanders, who in 2016 turned on a dime to stump for establishment pick Hillary Clinton after a coterie of unelected superdelegates declared her the winner following a primary process which leaked emails revealed beyond a shadow of a doubt to be rigged? Gabbard's political seppuku should force progressive Democrats to come to terms with the fact that there is no room for reform within their party.

Greta and Riccardo wanted to make one, too, but they can’t buy paper because shops are closed. To join in the movement, they managed to glue four precious sheets together. But as the days drag on, the kids’ nerves are on edge. “I feel really bad, I get bored too much, and nothing’s getting better,” Greta repeats to her mother.

The two biggest hurdles for the athletics department were housing and returfing the whole stadium. “The host families had to house the student- athletes for several weeks longer than expected and we are very grateful for their support,” Pitalo said. “Many host families attend all the games now, so that has been fun to see come full circle.” The returfing of the stadium was sponsored by various businesses in the community.

Nueva Zelanda ha vivido escenas de pánico este martes -víspera de un confinamiento general para combatir el coronavirus- con el asalto a terminales de ferris, compras compulsivas en los supermercados y expatriados atrapados en el extranjero.
 La policía ha intervenido en las terminales de los barcos que cubren los trayectos entre Wellington, en la isla Norte, y Picton, en la isla Sur.
 Cientos de personas intentaban desesperadamente conseguir una plaza en los transbordadores que cruzaban el estrecho de Cook.
 "Ha habido una gran afluencia de personas que no tenían billete", precisó la policía.
 La primera ministra, Jacinda Ardern, ordenó el lunes un confinamiento general de la población durante cuatro semanas a partir del miércoles a las 23H59 (10H59 GMT) para detener la propagación de la epidemia de COVID-19.
 El archipiélago se ha visto mucho menos afectado que otros países, con 142 casos. Pero el gobierno está convencido de que esta cifra puede dispararse si no se toman medidas drásticas.
 Air New Zealand, cuya actividad internacional es casi nula, ha aumentado el número de vuelos nacionales para permitir a los habitantes volver a casa antes del inicio del confinamiento.
 El caos en las terminales de ferris y en los aeropuertos ha llevado al gobierno a dar 48 horas más de plazo a la población para regresar a casa.
 "Nunca antes habíamos decidido cerrar nuestro país en 48 horas (...) Sé que es estresante, sobre todo para las personas que están en las terminales de ferris, pero lo lograremos", declaró Ardern a los periodistas. "Permitiremos a la gente volver a casa".
 La policía vigila la situación en los supermercados, donde se han registrado episodios de pánico, a pesar de que el gobierno afirmó que hay reservas.
 Según Countdown, una de las principales cadenas de supermercados, hubo una avalancha de clientes en cuanto de anunció el confinamiento. En las últimas tres semanas la demanda ya había sido muy alta.
 "Hay que calmarse", dijo la portavoz del grupo Kiri Hannifin a Radio Nueva Zelanda. "No es culpa nuestra si las estanterías están vacíos, se debe a la forma en que las personas hacen la compra".

That shouldn’t come as much of a shocker given that Edge is now based on Chromium. On Twitter today, Microsoft said that it will “pause updating the stable channel to Edge 81, consistent with Chromium Project.” That mirrors Google’s decision to keep Chrome 81 in beta for the time being, rather than promoting it to stable.

Nel giro di qualche giorno, la Furiozzi si «pentirà» e verrà inserita nel circuito carcerario dei collaboratori, che si trovano tutti nel carcere ciociaro di Paliano; qui avrà un flirt con Angelo Izzo e una storia con Cristiano Fioravanti. Finendo per farsi coinvolgere, soprattutto dal primo, in una serie di rivelazioni de relato - «Macciò mi ha raccontato che Cavallini gli ha confessato...» - che accuseranno Nanni De Angelis e Luigi Ciavardini come esecutori materiali della strage di Bologna. Per fortuna della memoria del primo, quel giorno era impegnato in una partita di football americano. Ciavardini, sfortunatamente, era latitante e quindi non aveva alibi «certificati» da fornire a sua discolpa. Per di più, come spesso accade in questi casi, per una sorta di domino, verrà accusato anche da altri «pentiti» e sarà condannato a trent'anni di carcere per la strage, evitando l'ergastolo solo perché minorenne all'epoca dei fatti.

At night, as I lay awake in my hotel room, I suddenly recalled how on board the Garuda Indonesia, between Pontianak and Jakarta, at least four people were coughing, loudly and desperately. Nobody was checking them. The Indonesian government had suggested that people pray, to avoid the outbreak of the coronavirus.

                                                                            I am going to once again go over one of the most difficult challenges in today's investment climate: maintaining a reality check on your fears.                                                                            Given the performance of the markets recently, it is no surprise that many investors have suddenly had to come to terms with the potential perils of investing and the unpredictability of market returns.                                                                            It has been more than a month since the S&P; 500 has managed to rally on consecutive days. Still, there remains some evidence that markets continue to function, and if you can just hold in there then today's brutal dislocation will be tomorrow's opportunity.                                                                            Say this for the Fed, they have not been afraid to act quickly. It seems that a new program or two is unveiled almost every day. They may be fighting the last war, but you cannot accuse them of not deploying heavy artillery.                                                                            In truth, some of what we are seeing play out in recent days represents the hangover for a decade-plus of easy money. Nonetheless, there are reasons for optimism. It seems clear is that there are already some interesting opportunities for those prepared to take on a degree of liquidity risk. In addition, you need to be mentally prepared for some grim data to emerge in the coming weeks and months.                                                                            Next week's jobless-claims number will likely chalk up a record high. Some of the quarterly GDP forecasts out there for Q2 are less than what we would hope for. In a sense it is war and the coronavirus as humanity's common enemy.                                                                            It is likely that the financial markets will plateau before the economic data indicates a light at the end of the tunnel. Therefore, you need to be mentally and financially prepared for a lot of \"sticker shock\" data points over an indefinite period.                                                                            Hopefully policymakers are making the right moves and thereby building a foundation for an eventual recovery. It's too soon to trade that view now, but by the same token it's probably too late to panic.                                                                            Meanwhile, businesses are shuttering, and borders are locking up. The virus has the world on a virtual standstill. And a rapid decline in forecasts for the global economy and corporate earnings has broken the bull market for stocks and ushered in a bout of volatility not seen since the Great Depression.                                                                            The S&P; 500 has moved an average 7.7% in the past seven sessions, and on Monday, the index saw its worst day in three decades. So, is any corporation doing well in this maelstrom?                                                                            Walmart (WMT) appears better positioned than most to be able to cope with the coronavirus pandemic                                                                            Anxious shoppers are hoarding everyday goods and non-essential stores are shuttered. The coronavirus pandemic presents a never-before-seen crisis for retailers. Yet, Walmart appears better prepared to deal with it than its peers.                                                                            Hefty investment in e-commerce, health care and its 1.5-million strong workforce have the world's largest retailer poised to supply large swaths of the nation as governments and other businesses grapple to respond to the unprecedented threat.                                                                            Rival Amazon.com stands to benefit as well, but Walmart can leverage its store network and clout with suppliers to gain a leg up.                                                                            Even so, the challenge of stocking the nation amid a run on essential goods will be a stern test, even for an operation on Walmart's scale.                                                                            Walmart prides itself on crisis management. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans, Walmart's truckers shuttled bottled water, diapers and socks to displaced residents -- often before the Federal Emergency Management Agency showed up.                                                                            When the Great Recession crimped consumer spending, Walmart's low prices and wide assortment made it ideal for those trading down and cocooning at home.                                                                            Note that Walmart can act only because of embracing radical change to its business model. These changes span across the company but are most evident in its market-leading online grocery business.                                                                            Walmart has spent the past five years aggressively expanding that service, in part to provide a bulwark against Amazon's dominance of most other areas of online shopping. Now, that investment could pay off as coronavirus-conscious consumers, stuck at home, eschew brick-and-mortar stores for the web.                                                                             _-- Lauren Rudd is a financial writer and columnist.

Foldable phones like the Motorola Razr and Galaxy Z Flip attempt to be more pocketable by letting a phone the size of the Galaxy S20 Ultra fold into a size that's actually smaller than the iPhone SE. But when I use a Motorola Razr or Galaxy Z Flip in their open position one-handed, I'm still unable to tap buttons or swipe through menus that are at the top of the phone.                                                                            At this point Apple hasn't officially dipped its toe into the foldable phone waters. And even if it did take this approach there was one more thing the iPhone SE was naturally great at: one-handed use. You didn't need any software tricks or fancy foldable screens to reach things.                                                                            ## iPhone SE 2 needs more than just Reachability mode                                                                                                                    The iPhone SE has the same body as the iPhone 5 and 5S and those phones were built to be used one-handed. With their 4-inch displays, your thumb could reach pretty much every part of the screen easily, and that's what I want in the iPhone 9.                                                                            When it launched the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, Apple employed a new feature called Reachability as a workaround for reaching the top of the new larger screens. To use Reachability, you double-tapped the home button which lowered the top part of what was on the screen to the middle. It made it easy to reach things one-handed. But the downside was you had to toggle the mode on and off, which added extra steps to anything you want to do on your phone one-handed.                                                                            Initially using Reachability on an iPhone X was an exercise in frustration.

New Delhi [India], Mar 24 (ANI): The Bar Council of India (BCI) on Tuesday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Ministers of all states seeking financial assistance for young and financially stressed lawyers across the country in the wake of coronavirus.                                        "The BCI would like to make a fervent and urgent request to your good selves to kindly make a provision for providing a minimum subsistence allowance of Rs 20,000 per month for young and not financially well off advocates, who are staying and practicing in the country," BCI said in a letter addressed to the senior leaders.                                        The council said that the entire country is passing through difficult times owing to the menace of coronavirus and all the professions except those providing essential services have gone into lockdown.                                        "However, advocates and courts are still almost functioning albeit in a limited and restrictive mode where important matters are being heard with only advocates of both sides, besides the Judge, being present to argue," the BCI said.                                        "It is only a handful of 10 per cent advocates in the country who can be comfortably stated to be in a position to survive and subsist without any earning during this time of crisis," it added.                                        The BCI said that work and earning opportunities have ceased for lawyers, who it said earn and live by the day or earnings of the week.                                        "Many young, and not financially well off or needy advocates are finding it exceedingly difficult to make ends meet. It is a question of keeping themselves and their families alive, by providing them with basic food and taking care of there medicinal and health needs," the council said adding that the families of many advocates have come to the stage of starvation.                                        This comes as courts in several states have limited or restricted its functioning while lockdown and curfew have been imposed in several places across the country to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

The U.S. Senate could pass a $2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package as soon as Tuesday, negotiators said, insisting they had made significant progress despite failing so far to reach a bipartisan deal on the sweeping legislation.                                                                                    Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trump's treasury secretary, said he would return to the Capitol for more talks on Tuesday, after a day of negotiations ended at midnight without an agreement. Neither Mnuchin nor Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would provide details, but both were optimistic. "That's the expectation, that we will finish it tomorrow and hopefully vote on it tomorrow," Schumer told reporters.                                                                                    Republicans, Democrats and top Trump aides had negotiated for days over the package, which would be the third and largest passed to address the crisis if it is backed by both the Republican-majority Senate and Democratic-majority House of Representatives. To become law, the measure must be signed by Trump. Mnuchin said he spoke to the president at least 10 times during the marathon negotiating session on Monday.                                                                                    Democrats twice blocked attempts to advance a Republican version of the bill as negotiations on a bipartisan measure continued. Democrats said the Republican plan did not provide enough money for states and hospitals, lacked sufficient aid for unemployed Americans and did not include adequate supervision of a massive fund to aid big businesses.                                                                                    The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, shuttered thousands of businesses, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order about 100 million people - nearly a third of the nation's population - to stay at home. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was consulted in the talks, introduced her own $2.5 trillion counterproposal to the Republican plan as the negotiations continued.                                                                                    It was not clear early on Tuesday whether Pelosi supported the bipartisan plan in the works in the Senate. Trump's administration has launched a major push for action to blunt the economic impact - and steep stock market decline - from the pandemic, after Trump spent weeks dismissing the risks.                                                                                    While details of the emerging bipartisan bill were not available, it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work because of the virus and help for struggling industries such as airlines. Republicans normally hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning they need Democratic support to garner the 60 votes required to advance most legislation.                                                                                    But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats even more leverage. Republican Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus and four other Republicans are also unable to vote because they were exposed to Paul or others with the virus.

It will take nothing less to save the day.

BOSTON -- Massachusetts' youngest residents, their parents, and the workforce that cares for them began facing a new landscape Monday, when early education providers across the state were officially shuttered under an emergency order.
 The order Gov. Charlie Baker issued last Wednesday -- one of several aimed at stemming the spread of the new coronavirus and promoting social distancing practices -- temporarily closes all early education providers across the state, effective from 11:59 p.m. Sunday until at least April 6.
 Baker's order allowed for the operation of emergency child care programs with priority access to such programs for "vulnerable children and children of families who work to maintain the health, safety and welfare of all Commonwealth residents."
 For early education providers and workers, the last few days have been a period of transition, ironing out what an emergency model looks like, what steps can be taken to protect the health of staff and families, and how to ensure the system is ready to return to full operations after a closure that could potentially last beyond two weeks.
 "We're in an unknown world," Bill Eddy, executive director of the Massachusetts Association for Early Education and Care, said in an interview.
 The trade association for private, community-based early education programs and before- and after-school providers in Massachuestts, Eddy's group represents more than 600 early education centers, school age providers and 43 family child care systems.
 Eddy said there are "two real questions" facing the system as it shifts into "shutdown mode."
 "How many children are there really that parents will choose, this is what they want to do?" he said. "The second question is, can we find enough early educators that will work to really staff these centers? We hope so."
 On Saturday, the state published a list of more than 300 center-based and home-based providers that will operate on an emergency, drop-in basis for instances "when all other non-group-care settings have been exhausted and families have no other options."
 "We expect more to come online eventually, but this needs to be implemented safely and the sites should only really be used as a last resort," Baker said in a Saturday press conference.
 The list includes contact information and hours of operation, along with a note advising that priority will be given to groups including "health care workers, essential state and human service workers, COVID-19 health workers, grocery store employees, emergency response personnel, law enforcement, transportation and infrastructure workers, sanitation workers, DCF-involved families, and families living in shelters."
 Eddy said the groups of children he's most concerned about are the children of first responders, the children of essential health care employees and the "8,000 children in this commonwealth who are in our care because they are in the custody of the Department of Children and Families" due to abuse and neglect.
 "The most stable aspects of their lives are the 10 and a half hours they spend in our programs," Eddy said, referring to DCF-involved children. "Those are the ones we really, really want to keep an eye on."
 He said his group is suggesting that providers reach out to those children and their families to see if there's any way possible they remain in their early education program.
 "We feel some sort of special mission that we need to be the stability, we need to be the safety net for those children, and we want to make sure they're not lost in this tough climate," he said.
 U.S. Reps. Katherine Clark, Joseph Kennedy III and Ayanna Pressley were among a group of Congress members who wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Friday, asking for an investment of at least $21 billion in child care funding to states as part of a third stimulus package.
 Citing a National Association for the Education of Young Children survey of more than 6,000 providers that showed 30 percent would not survive a closure of more than two weeks, the lawmakers said that more providers will be forced to permanently close their doors the longer the crisis lasts.
 "Moreover, providers who stay open to support essential workers in health care, grocery, transportation, and other critical industries often lack the resources necessary for additional cleaning supplies, staff hazard pay, substitute teachers, paid sick leave, and health-related training," they wrote.
 Eddy said there is a key difference between the Massachusetts early education system and the other two components of the state's education secretariat. While the workers in public K-12 schools and public higher education are public employees, early education is typically provided through private, community based programs.
 "At the end of the day, if we have to lay off all our early educators if the rates aren't paid, we're looking at a tough system to rebuild," he said.

1. To facilitate a love of reading, you need to make it easy for kids to find their favorite books.                                                                                    If your child reads in bed, then a bedside basket or nightstand that can hold their favorite books would be perfect. It you read together on the couch, then have a few books nearby. It makes it easy to snuggle up with a favorite.                                                                                    2. Keep the number of books in these spaces manageable.                                                                                    Little ones who can’t read words identify books by color. If you’re organizing books on a shelf, keep in mind that having them in color order, like a rainbow, will help a young toddler identify their desired book in the collection.

I grew up in Southern California neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly white — white schools, white teachers, white curriculum. I remember visiting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where a cast of _Auguste Rodin’s monumental sculpture of Balzac_ towered over me. My friends and I immersed ourselves in the works of white authors, and I can still recite vast sections of T.S. Eliot’s “The Hollow Men,” William Butler Yeats’s “The Second Coming,” and, if I squeeze my eyes real tight, the final luxurious paragraphs of “The Dead,” James Joyce’s masterful short story.

Hoffheinz managed to bring in 25 Romanians before the borders jammed up – far fewer than the 45 to 50 he will need when the season is in full swing in three weeks. Because of various border closures, “no laborers are coming from the whole eastern bloc, no matter where you look,” he says. He says he'll try to find Germans to do some of the logistical jobs usually done by Romanians – driving the asparagus from the field to a building where it is sorted, and grading the harvest.

The governor can issue recommendations, health officials and local government officials can repeat the calls to wash your hands, stay indoors and help “flatten the curve.” But it’s the hard numbers, reported daily, that give residents confidence this crisis is being addressed, even if the pandemic continues to grow.                                                                                    The Business Journal said hundreds of tests remain in the pipeline. For example, UMass Memorial in Worcester had sent 450 tests to labs as of Thursday, with only 150 of those back with results.                                                                                    Baker and state health officials who take their turns at the microphone each day have tried to put the rising toll in context by emphasizing that the number of positive test results is partly a result of more people being tested. And a rise in deaths from COVID-19 is the unfortunate result of the virus going through an incubation period and approaching a critical point where people are getting sick and dying.                                                                                    MITRE, a nonprofit cited by the Business Journal, said in a report this week the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. “significantly underrepresent the actual number of active domestic COVID-19 infections,” in large part because of limited testing and the “multi-day period of asymptomatic infectivity associated with” the virus. In other words, there aren’t enough tests being done and there is a lag time between when a person might get the virus and actually show symptoms and be tested.                                                                                    If DPH officials have a reason for pressuring hospitals to not release information, that needs to be explained, in public. The public should have access to as much information – even if its numbers about COVID-19 swabs taken, sent off to a lab and not yet returned – to be kept fully aware of where we all stand as this pandemic progresses and moves on.

These interactions are deeply difficult now and often relegated to brief visits in full personal protective equipment or phone interactions. Instead of sitting face to face with patients, I now call their cellphones from outside of their room, making a personal connection that much harder. Face-to-face family meetings have been moved to telephone or telemedicine as well. Being in the ICU is lonely enough for patients; but that feeling of being alone has to be that much more profound with visitor limitations and health care workers having to take extra precautions to keep themselves safe.

To note, Bhula Dunga is Sidharth and Shehnaaz’s first collaboration after Bigg Boss 13. Interestingly, the renowned Punjabi singer, who has been quite vocal about her feelings for Sidharth, is often seen going gaga over the Balika Vadhu star. In fact, during her show Mujhse Shaadi Karoge, wherein Shehnaaz was apparently searching for a groom for herself, the diva was frequently spotted talking about Sidharth. While love is definitely in the air for Shehnaaz, we wonder if Sidharth will make a move anytime soon.

The pandemic has forced postponement or cancellation of almost every sports event in the country.                         The Calcutta High Court formed a three-member panel to examine the situation in all correctional homes of West Bengal and prepare a report on the number of inmates who could be granted bail or parole to avoid crowding in jails, in view of the deadly outbreak.                         A division bench comprising Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee formed the committee with Justice Dipankar Datta, the chairman of State Legal Services Authority, as its head, and sought a report on the correctional homes by March 31.                         The Director-General (prisons) and principal secretary, home department, are the two other members of the high court-constituted panel. The committee has been asked to propose criteria for granting bail to undertrial inmates and suggest whether prisoners in jail for over 10 years be granted parole under the present circumstances.                                                                The high court took up the issue suo moto in light of a Supreme Court direction on Monday, asking all state governments and Union territories to set up high-level committees to determine the class of prisoners who could be released on parole for four to six weeks.                         The apex court said prisoners convicted of or charged with offences having prison terms up to seven years can be given parole to decongest the jails. It had also said that several prison staff enter the prisons regularly, and so do visitors and lawyers and therefore, there is a high risk of transmission of COVID-19 to the prison inmates.                         Most lawyers in the state have stopped appearing for hearings following a resolution passed by the West Bengal Bar Council for non-participation in judicial proceedings at the Calcutta High Court and other courts in the state till March 31 in view of the prevailing situation.

However, post Super Tuesday, the race still remains up for grabs. In order for a candidate to technically win the Democratic nomination, they must have a majority of the 3,979 delegates that will be sent to the convention. In this case, 1,991 are needed to guarantee them the spot on the ticket. Biden with 664 currently leads to Sanders’s 573 (with some still to be awarded). Some 62% of the delegates are still up for grabs. With primaries scheduled until June, the senator still has a little time left to overcome the former vice president’s currently small lead. The next few weeks alone are going to be crucial for both campaigns. Thirteen more states (most which look good for Biden) have yet to vote this month and the two are set to face each other in a debate on March 15.

Insta360 released at least two firmware updates while we were testing, so those issues will hopefully be short-lived. But, the modular design, video quality, and extra features — not to mention the competitive $480 price for both camera mods — is worth putting up with a few minor quirks.

_To Steal or Not to Steal_ puts Carmen back into the hands of the evil organization VILE to complete various capers at their bidding, since the bad guys kidnapped her friends. Unlike the original PC games, where the gameplay was strictly of the edutainment variety, the choices here involve the viewer picking the best way for Carmen to pull off a heist. Does she enter the building from the top, or go in from the ground up? The options are pretty straightforward, but with few exceptions, the choices are cosmetic. There’s almost always a “wrong” option, and picking it will lead to failure. Then the game selects the “right” answer that it wanted all along.

The comments were further evidence that Trump has grown impatient with the pandemic, even before it has reached its expected peak. In recent days, tensions have been rising between those who argue the country needs to get back up and running to prevent a deep economic depression and medical experts who warn that, unless more extreme action is taken, the human cost will be catastrophic.

An increase in the number of electrical, electronic, and electro-mechanical functions in vehicles has given birth to several innovations in the operation and design of automotive power system, with fuse boxes prevailing as the only choice of circuit protection. Despite dominance of traditional automotive fuse boxes in light of their low unit cost, significant opportunity lies in the incorporation of more intelligent, electronic fuse, which might offer the potential for cutting down costs and reduce weight of vehicles substantially.

New Delhi [India], Mar 24 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday interacted with print media heads through video conferencing over COVID-19 and lauded media for its "praiseworthy role in disseminating information".                                            According to a press release, Prime Minister Modi interacted with over twenty journalists and stakeholders from print media from all over the country.                                            The journalists joined the interaction from fourteen locations and consisted of both national and regional media, representing eleven different languages.                                            Prime Minister said, "Media has played a praiseworthy role in disseminating information to every nook and cranny of this nation. The network of media is pan-India and spread across cities and villages. This makes the media all the more significant in fighting this challenge and spreading correct information about it at micro level."                                            He added that the newspapers carry tremendous credibility and the local page of a region is widely read by people. It is therefore imperative that awareness about coronavirus is spread through articles published on this page.                                            It is essential to inform people about where the testing centres are, who should get tested, whom to contact to get tested and follow home isolation protocols. This information should be shared in newspapers and web portals of the paper, the Prime Minister said.                                            He also suggested that information like the location of availability of essential items during lockdown can also be shared in the regional pages.                                            Prime Minister asked the media to act as a link between government and people and provide continuous feedback, at both national and regional level.                                            He underlined the importance of social distancing, asking media to generate awareness about its importance, inform people about the lockdown decision by states, and also highlight the impact of the spread of the virus, through the inclusion of international data and case studies about other countries in the papers.                                            The journalists and stakeholders from print media said that they will work on the suggestions of the Prime Minister to publish inspiring and positive stories.                                             Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation at 8 pm tonight on issues relating to the COVID-19 threat.

Having managed to get much of its domestic outbreak under control, Beijing is now unambiguously positioning itself to build new friends and influence. That's included the shipment of medical supplies and small numbers of experts to affected European states, including Italy, France and Spain.                                                    Russia, meanwhile, is also clearly watching closely, its media outlets vigorously broadcasting details of what it claims is a flawed and sometimes chaotic Western response.                                                    Some international cooperation is clearly taking place -- for example, to keep limited goods flowing across the EU despite the lockdown. Even the battle for a vaccine, however, is increasingly portrayed in terms of national competition rather than cooperation.                                                    If headlines from major English-language outlets in both countries are any guide, the crisis has further damaged already difficult relations between China and the United States.                                                    U.S. President Donald Trump has clearly infuriated Beijing with his repeated references to the disease as a "Chinese virus," comments he says were a response to earlier suggestions from a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman that the disease had in fact originated in America. Beijing has largely avoided repeating that comment since, but if anything Trump has continued to double down on his rhetoric.                                                    These multiple geopolitical battlefronts have many strands, few receiving much attention against the backdrop to the wider crisis. Iran, amongst the most affected countries, finds itself in a particularly complex position. It is lobbying furiously -- albeit unsuccessfully -- for the United States to soften its sanctions to help it tackle the outbreak, even as its proxy forces gain influence against America's allies in Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere.                                                    Relations with China and Russia remain extremely hard to predict. Last week, China's Global Times reported Chinese fighter jets had made a show of force near Taiwan, while threatening potential electronic warfare or other unconventional attacks against U.S. ships if they continued to probe waters the Chinese have claimed in the South China Sea. Such rhetoric seems to have been scaled back, for now at least -- but aggressive nationalism in multiple locations is at least one potential outcome of the crisis.                                                    What is clear across the board is that almost every nation has looked to seal its borders against population moves from the outside world -- and that in many cases, the virus has also exacerbated pre-existing racism and xenophobia. Simultaneously, and paradoxically, nations such as Serbia have also become more aware of their dependence on the outside world, for economic and basic human needs.                                                    That points to a much larger paradox from this crisis. In some respects, the global system has proved much more vulnerable than many anticipated. In other ways, however, it is demonstrating impressive levels of resilience. For all the economic shock of hundreds of millions of people ceasing travel and working from home, food supplies and particularly communications are broadly holding up. Huge swaths of the planet are locked down, but people are still talking to each other with relative ease.                                                    What is currently happening is a challenge for globalization on a scale not previously seen -- as well as an experience being simultaneously shared across the planet in ways that are at least equally unusual. Who wins and loses from that is a very open question, but what is clear is that those contests are already underway.                                                     _Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalization, conflict and other issues._

Size. This is the first stop when choosing any new television. Measure the space available in the area it will reside, then write down the figure (we don’t want to make a mistake here). Next, make a note that screen size is not equal to the length of the television itself. You will need to consult the dimensions for this measurement, which takes us on to the next step: Gather a handful of QLED TVs that could do the trick, then check their dimensions.

Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi's call for a first-of-its- kind "janata curfew" on March 22 was by the people, for the people. It was symbolic of India's resolve to fight the deadly coronavirus disease (Covid-19) which has thrown global social life and the economy out of kilter. With a rising number of cases in India, we must be prepared to tackle a burgeoning social and economic crisis.While the public health care system, both at the central and the state level, is dealing with the challenge, the private sector is also fully geared up to assist and support the State in testing, making beds and quarantine facilities for treatment available, training health care workers as well as providing 24x7 helplines and spreading awareness through social media and other such tools.With the government allowing testing and issuing guidelines for testing in private laboratories, it is necessary to step up capabilities in testing and treatment. The private sector has been in close touch with the government on private-public partnerships (PPP) relating to Covid-19. A powerful ecosystem will soon evolve through PPP to address the medical concerns of this crisis.There is no room for complacency. The public's adherence to self-isolate is extremely critical. Also, a combination of health responses, larger public discipline and timely identification of vulnerability, both relating to health care and the economy, is vital in dealing with the challenges thrown up by the spread of the disease.On the economic front, while companies have been requested not to retrench employees, we must also focus on the unorganised sector, where daily wage earners will be severely affected. A methodology to directly transfer money into their accounts is critical. Industry has been an active participant in supporting the government in collecting and submitting data and analysing the impact of Covid-19 across sectors and the country at large. In particular, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has developed a guide for organisations based on best practices globally. A survey conducted by FICCI shows that there has been a major impact on companies even in the early stages of the crisis. Hence, going forward, with containment measures, it is important to work on a national reconstruction plan to address the damage to the economy.Over the past few quarters, the Indian economy has experienced a significant slowdown, and is in serious danger of recording growth of below 4% in the coming quarters. To make matters worse, the pandemic has severely impacted efforts that were being made towards economic recovery and has derailed several significant sectors -- tourism, hospitality, aviation, financial markets, manufacturing and information technology. There is an urgent need to address the pain points of the industry that could help minimise the impact on economy in general, and Indian businesses in particular. Indisputably, this calls for a combination of monetary, fiscal and financial market measures.The role of the task force constituted by the PM and led by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be pivotal in framing a national reconstruction plan.The foremost requirement in the rebuilding exercise is to relax the mandatory filing norms and defer/waive the interest payment and tax liabilities of the companies impacted heavily by the outbreak. Additionally, maintaining liquidity at surplus levels and special liquidity support for companies, non-banking financial companies and banks that come under strain due to the intensifying risk aversion in the financial markets or due to large demand shock will also be crucial.All payments towards the service of principal, interest and taxes should be deferred by two quarters at this point. These two quarters should not be considered for the calculation of non-performing assets.As the industry body, several recommendations are being submitted by FICCI to the government to consider including as part of this exercise. In crisis resolution, it is important to look for a silver lining. We must look for potential opportunities even now. Businesses including pharmaceuticals, chemicals, solar power, electric vehicles are facing disruption in supply chains due to the impact of the virus in China. A concerted strategy must be developed for them along with special considerations for manufacturing critical items in the health care sector.At one end, social distancing, work-from-home and public curfews are keeping people apart. Yet, in innumerable ways, they are bringing the world's largest democracy together as a collective force. In response to the PM's address, several people and organisations have come forward to help the vulnerable; some by reducing their salaries, others by paying wages to their staff and supporting workers during self-quarantine. There is a long list of sacrifices being made. We need to get into mission-mode to defeat the spread of Covid-19 and build a new, stronger and healthier India. Together, let's make this happen.Sangita Reddy is joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals Group and president, FICCIThe views expressed are personal

Prezident republiky Miloš Zeman si bez mediálního humbuku kolem pozval jak současného, tak bývalého ministra zdravotnictví a ptal se jich, jaký je největší problém v boji s koronavirem. Dostal odpověď, že klíčovým problémem je výrazný nedostatek zdravotnických prostředků. Prodavačky v obchodech by o tom dokázaly vyprávět přímo horrorové příběhy a je dobře, že se jejich mzda zvedla na sto čtyřicet šest korun hrubého. Ze dvou ověřených pramenů jsem slyšel otřesný případ jedné bezpečnostní agentury, která využila brigádníků s hrubou mzdou sto korun na hodinu, bez možnosti proplacení jediného dne dovolené a příplatku za práci o nedělích a státních svátcích, a nechala je pouze s jednoduchou rouškou na ústech měřit teplotu více než třem stovkám lidí a jednat »face to face« s řidiči kamionů, kteří přijížděli z rizikových zemí. Pokud by někdo z nich onemocněl, neměl by nárok na jedinou korunu nemocenské, protože za brigádníky už nemusí chlebodárce platit ani sociální ani zdravotní pojištění. A ještě se na jeho mizernou mzdu mohou skládat hned tři firmy najednou.

The S20 Plus and the S20 Ultra both run Android 10 with Samsung’s One UI 2.0 over the top, which is simpler and cleaner than previous versions, and, importantly for phones this size, easier to use one-handed. The software update schedule for these phones will likely be much the same, so there’s no obvious advantage for either here.

As members of the Vermont Business Roundtable, we recognize the opportunity and obligation we have, to do our share to alleviate the severity of disruption to our economic and social fabric.                                                            We believe that limiting the impact of the COVID-19 health crisis is the most important step we should take at this time. Doing so will reduce the public health threat that must be addressed before our economy will be restored – at the state and national levels – to a new normal. Our extremely talented health care professionals and institutions are working in a coordinated fashion to serve the public. Their request of us is straightforward: 1) prepare for the long term, this won’t disappear in two weeks; 2) stay home; and, 3) for those who can’t stay home, to maximize healthy and sterile protocols. We urge all Vermonters to honor their requests. We can flatten the severity and duration of this outbreak to the benefit for everyone, if we respect the social distancing guidance of health care professionals.                                                            We believe that our economic crisis will have a disproportionate impact on lower income wage earners. This will result in significant and disproportionate impacts on their health and vitality, in turn. A struggling economy also means that other systems are weakened as a result, including education, health care, and workforce pipelines. We respond by asking employers who are laying off workers to engage with the Roundtable’s Vermont Talent Pipeline. Through this project, we can help match that talent with employers seeking to increase their seasonal workforces or respond to spikes in demand for products and services. In addition, Roundtable members are acting quickly and decisively to protect vulnerable Vermonters through efforts such as suspension of debt collection for consumers, ceasing utility disconnections, and deferring payments on agricultural loans. And, we will be holding member-wide calls on a regular basis to find more ways, within and outside our membership, to help those most impacted.                                                            We believe that sharing our corporate and community successes will benefit the entire state. We will communicate through a variety of platforms the successful adjustments being made by our member companies, so that others might benefit as well. During our last state emergency – Tropical Storm Irene – Vermonters learned that we are stronger when we act together, Vermont Strong, in fact. We now find ourselves in a much more urgent situation, and our survival demands that we dig deep within ourselves again.

Early voting the way to go
                           News

SPRINGFIELD - The Illinois General Assembly on Monday began its second week of shutdown due to the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, and officials said it is still uncertain when, or under what circumstances, the session will resume.


  Officials in the offices of Senate President Don Harmon and House Speaker Michael Madigan said Monday that conversations have been taking place among legislative leaders and their respective caucuses, but as of yet no decision has been made.


  "For now, we continue to weigh legislative and procedural priorities so that when we return to session we can be effective and efficient while also protecting public health and safety," Harmon's spokesman, John Patterson, said in an email.


  The last day lawmakers met was Thursday, March 5. They were scheduled to be off the following week, March 9-13, as many members campaigned in their home districts during the lead-up to the March 17 primary. They were scheduled to return Wednesday, March 18, but several days before that Gov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration and began urging Illinoisans to practice "social distancing."


  "The plan is to monitor and talk with the offices, and come back when it's safe to come back, not only for members of the General Assembly but whatever arrangement we've made relative to the public meeting part," Madigan's spokesman, Steve Brown, said in a phone conversation.


  The most important piece of legislation awaiting action is the state budget. Pritzker has proposed a $42 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins July 1, some of which depends on voters approving a constitutional amendment in November that would allow the state to levy a graduated income tax that levies higher rates on higher levels of income.


  That budget, however, was built around assumptions that the state's economy would continue growing at roughly the same rate it had been growing before the COVID-19 outbreak. The outbreak, however, has forced many businesses to either close temporarily or scale back their operations while many of their employees have been furloughed.


  That is certain to have a negative impact on sales and income tax collections for the remainder of the current fiscal year, and the revenue slump could continue into the next fiscal year.


  Brown said the impact of such a slump could be eased depending on whether Congress approves an economic recovery package that provides aid to state and local governments. As of Monday, however, that recovery package was stalled in the U.S. Senate.


  Meanwhile, there are a number of other bills pending that are considered "must-pass" legislation, meaning the state could face dire consequences if they fail to pass.


  One of those is a renewal of the state's hospital assessment program, which generates about $3.5 billion each year to help fund hospitals that treat large numbers of Medicaid patients. Under that program, hospitals are assessed a tax based on the number of inpatient and outpatient procedures they perform.


  That money is then used to draw down federal matching funds and it is distributed back to hospitals based on the number of Medicaid patients they serve because Medicaid typically pays lower reimbursement rates than Medicare or private insurance.


  Illinois launched that program in 1992 but it must be renewed periodically and each renewal must be approved by the federal government. The current program is set to expire on June 30.


  Danny Chun, a spokesman for the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, said in an interview that conversations have been taking place behind the scenes about what the new program should look like, but he said time is a critical factor.


  That's because once a bill is passed and signed by the governor, the federal review process could still take two or three months.


  Without the hospital assessment program, Illinois hospitals would lose $3.5 billion in revenue at a time when they could be under significant stress treating COVID-19 patients.


  Chun said one of the options he has heard discussed would be to call the General Assembly back into session for a single day - possibly even half a day - just to pass a budget and a few other essential bills.


  Patterson did not confirm or deny such a plan, saying in an email, "lots of options are being explored and discussed."

LANGFITT: No, and I'm glad you saw those, Ari. What happened this weekend, it was a glorious weekend here, certainly, in southeastern England. And people were out and about. People were walking in the parks. They were walking close together. In my town - outside of London, where I live, people were out and about on the streets. And people were shopping in malls. I mean, it did not look like a place that was in the midst of an epidemic.

On these matters, competence and ideology overlap. Governments willing to intervene have been more effective at stemming the virus than laissez-faire capitalists. The further right the government, the more inclined it is to delay action and offload blame elsewhere. International comparisons suggest this could be making infection and death rates steeper.

“I really want them to be able to see this and to really understand the damage that’s being done to the lungs, the severity of the disease that this is causing, so perhaps, maybe they think twice before having a house party or going outside to large groups,” Mortman said.

In the real world, though, there’s little between them. Unless you had an OLED TV and a QLED TV in the same room, you wouldn’t even know what you’re missing out on. The fact of the matter is, if your run-of-the-mill LED TV isn’t cutting it anymore and you’re looking to breathe fresh life into your entertainment setup, a QLED TV is a fantastic way to go: The richer color and more accurate detail, even without HDR, is a monumental step up.

Dear Dave,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Should you still pay debts that are in collections, even if they have been dropped from your credit report? The one in question is from 2011, and I assume it isn't showing on the credit report anymore because it's 9 years old.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Sam                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dear Sam,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There are two good reasons to go back and deal with this debt. One, even if it's off your credit report, you may still legally owe the money. Even if the statute of limitations has run its course, things like this have a habit of popping up and causing problems at the worst possible times. About the time you decide to buy a home, this is liable to raise its head again and mess things up. So, the fact that something doesn't appear on a credit report doesn't mean you're not legally liable, or that they won't bother you about it later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The second thing to think about is a simple matter of fact -- you owe the money. Regardless of what the legal system or credit report says, you morally owe the money. I'd contact the creditor, and begin negotiations to settle the debt. You might be able to reach an agreement where they'd accept less than the original amount owed. Regardless, get any type of settlement offer in writing. That way, you're truly cleaning up your life and getting rid of any financial skeletons in your closet!                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dave                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The simple thing is the right thing                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dear Dave,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I recently found out my former employer never stopped contributing to my health savings account (HSA). Apparently, this has been going on for about nine months, and they just sent me a form to sign so they can get the overpayment back. The amount totals a little over $1,000, so should I sign the papers or is there another way to handle this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Ellie                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Dear Ellie,                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You know, if I were as incompetent as your former employer, I'd be too embarrassed to ask for the money back. But hey, the point is it's not your money. Sign the forms, and let them take the money out. Keep an eye on your HSA balance, though, and make sure they take out only the amount they overpaid - not one penny more or less.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Keep it simple, Ellie. You didn't earn this money, and it wasn't expected or agreed upon. It was a mistake, so just do the right thing. Control the scenario, and stay on top of this situation until everything is resolved correctly.

Third, talk to strangers. Don’t waste the opportunity to smile at the checker when you’re making your purchase of a reasonable amount of toilet paper.                                                                                    Have that conversation that tacitly acknowledges that we’re all in this together and that we’ll get through.                                                                                    Those tiny moments of connection can have a lasting impact on how we feel.                                                                                    Loneliness is not the immediate crisis that coronavirus is. But loneliness is an epidemic that slowly but effectively chokes off the quality of life for too many Americans.                                                                                    It’s also a health concern.                                                                                    Murthy points to research that says lonely people have a greater risk of heart disease, stroke and dementia. So, in this moment of self-quarantining, not remembering others may only lead us to trade one public health problem for more down the road.

“If [consumers] are looking for better dairy products that are processed as little as possible that replicate the form of dairy in its natural state, they should consider organic foods,” Rissi said. “We have a lot of consumers that aren’t organic foodies that just really resonate with our brand because it’s the way that they remember butter or buttermilk or cottage cheese tasting when their grandparents used to make them stuff in their kitchen.

At the time of his death, Baker was taking part in the Air Force Combat Dive Course run by Air Education and Training Command's Special Warfare Training Wing headquartered at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "This is devastating loss to the entire Special Tactics community," U.S. Air Force Col. Matthew Allen, commander of the 24th SOW, said in a news release. "We are very grateful for Keigan's willingness to serve our nation and vow to honor his memory."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Baker enlisted in the United States Air Force in June 2018, and entered the two-year combat control training program after basic military training. At the time of his death, he was a student in the Air Force Combat Dive Course at Naval Support Activity Panama City.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As a Special Tactics combat controller apprentice, Baker was training to deploy into combat zones to conduct reconnaissance, global access, precision strike and personnel recovery operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    U.S. Air Force Col. Parks Hughes, commander of the service's Special Warfare Training Wing, said in a statement that "Keigan's loss is felt across the entire training wing ... . Our thoughts and prayers are with Keigan's family, friends and teammates."                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Baker, a graduate of Longview's Mark Morris High School, also held a bachelor's degree in business administration from Eastern Washington University.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    A number of agencies were involved in search and recovery efforts in the incident, including the Naval Diving and Salvage Training Center, U.S. Coast Guard Station Panama City, other military dive units, the Bay County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Rep. Matt Gaetz issued a statement in response to Baker's death, saying the airman's "patriotism and his devotion to serving his country will not soon be forgotten. Our Northwest Florida community and the entire nation mourns the loss of Airman First Class Keigan Baker and joins together in prayer for his family during this difficult time."

When I was a tween, I was fucking obsessed with _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ — the critically panned 2003 movie, not the Alan Moore comic-book series that inspired it. I watched it often — I still have the DVD — for the colorful characters, elaborate set design, constant action, and the ridiculousness of the kind of crossover that would only otherwise happen in fan fiction. In the years since, I’ve maintained my stance of, “ _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ movie is good, actually,” even though I haven’t really revisited it since I graduated from high school. But with each passing year, I’ve grown more and more worried that my fervently stated opinion might not actually hold up. In light of _The Invisible Man_ hitting theaters and the cherished memory of _The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ ’s own invisible man, I finally took the plunge back in, and I’m happy to report that I was right all along. The movie is still a masterpiece.

The U.S. Senate could pass a 2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus package as soon as Tuesday, negotiators said, insisting they had made significant progress despite failing so far to reach a bipartisan deal on the sweeping legislation.Steven Mnuchin, President Donald Trumps treasury secretary, said he would return to the Capitol for more talks on Tuesday, after a day of negotiations ended at midnight without an agreement. Neither Mnuchin nor Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer would provide details, but both were optimistic. Thats the expectation, that we will finish it tomorrow and hopefully vote on it tomorrow, Schumer told reporters.Republicans, Democrats and top Trump aides had negotiated for days over the package, which would be the third and largest passed to address the crisis if it is backed by both the Republican-majority Senate and Democratic-majority House of Representatives. To become law, the measure must be signed by Trump. Mnuchin said he spoke to the president at least 10 times during the marathon negotiating session on Monday.Democrats twice blocked attempts to advance a Republican version of the bill as negotiations on a bipartisan measure continued. Democrats said the Republican plan did not provide enough money for states and hospitals, lacked sufficient aid for unemployed Americans and did not include adequate supervision of a massive fund to aid big businesses.The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 550 people in the United States and sickened more than 43,800, shuttered thousands of businesses, thrown millions out of work and led state governors to order about 100 million people - nearly a third of the nations population - to stay at home. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was consulted in the talks, introduced her own 2.5 trillion counterproposal to the Republican plan as the negotiations continued.It was not clear early on Tuesday whether Pelosi supported the bipartisan plan in the works in the Senate. Trumps administration has launched a major push for action to blunt the economic impact - and steep stock market decline - from the pandemic, after Trump spent weeks dismissing the risks.While details of the emerging bipartisan bill were not available, it is expected to provide financial aid for Americans out of work because of the virus and help for struggling industries such as airlines. Republicans normally hold a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning they need Democratic support to garner the 60 votes required to advance most legislation.But the coronavirus has trimmed their ranks, giving Democrats even more leverage. Republican Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for coronavirus and four other Republicans are also unable to vote because they were exposed to Paul or others with the virus.

McGrory began to work with Erlandson, then a 15- or 16-year-old student at Brookfield High School, and gained her trust. Two months later, according to Erlandson, he took her to his rectory bedroom and sexually assaulted her for the first time. The abuse only stopped, she says, when she told McGrory she was pregnant.


  Years later, in April 1994, Erlandson went to the Ottawa police and filed a criminal complaint against McGrory.


  The priest had, by then, been moved from the Archdiocese of Ottawa.


  In a 2016 interview with the Citizen, McGrory said he went to Archbishop Joseph Aurele-Plourde in the mid-1980s to beg for help with what he considered to be a mental illness: his powerful attraction to adolescents, both male and female.


  Instead of offering help or launching an investigation, Plourde in 1987 approved McGrory's transfer to a Toronto-based organization that served remote Catholic missions. (Erlandson says her father was thrown out of the archbishop's office when he tried to complain about McGrory.)

Negli anni seguenti gli inquirenti hanno tentato di collegare Diego addirittura alla strage di Bologna. Per me è una follia. Basandosi su una vecchia agenda (quelle sue Smemorande...) e sulle dichiarazioni estorte in carcere a Raffaella Furiozzi (una povera ragazza, stritolata da una storia assurda) si è tentato di collegare Macciò a Cavallini. Nulla conta che, durante la latitanza del capo dei Nar, Diego fosse un ragazzino che già si era trasferito a Torino e che mai i due si sarebbero potuti incontrare. I giudici ritennero invece possibile il legame, basandosi sulle armi ritrovate ad Alessandria, che a loro avviso - non so in base a quale esame - arrivavano dal gruppo Cavallini. Dunque, è stato il loro ragionamento, i due si conoscevano.

Il gruppetto guidato da Cosso e Macciò, insomma, voleva ripetere in tutto e per tutto le gesta dei Nar. Aiutati da altri camerati torinesi, i due si erano procurati una pistola e un fucile a canne mozze, rapinandoli a un vigilante e a un collezionista.

At the end of December — after four months of delay — the city provided the records. They revealed a lot, and they also raised many new questions.


  This summary begins in the shallow end, so to speak, and gets deeper as other topics are addressed in op-eds to follow. The focus of this installment is the Aquatic Center.


  The city has claimed the Aquatic Center has been operating in the black. The records show that there are some significant omissions in the city’s accounting for the center.


  The city’s records suggest that the Aquatic Center was close to break-even in 2018 and 2019. For example, in 2018, expenses were $502,417 while revenue was $510,767 — a positive margin of about $8,000. But there’s a discrepancy. The administration reported to the city council during last summer’s budget hearing that 2018 revenue was $502,997. Based on that figure, the Aquatic Center was within $600 of losing money. The figures for 2019 were generally similar, showing the complex about $23,000 to the good.


  Importantly, these figures reflect only current revenue and expenses. They don’t account for big-ticket repair and replacement of facilities and equipment, nor do they account for the cost of paying off the bond issued to finance the facility that originally cost $11 million.


  In 2018, the center was open for 89 days. It was closed because of weather on five days and closed early due to weather on 27 days. Attendance [at the] center: 45,430 visits. In 2019, there were 48,008 visits, and the facility was completely closed for three days and closed early 26 times as a result of weather.


  The purpose of this inquiry is not to suggest that the city should close or sell the Aquatic Center. The simple objective is there to be transparency regarding its true cost.


  Many of the records received raised as many questions as they answered. In addition to concerns about the actual costs of financing and keeping the Aquatic Center going, one might wonder as to whether there have been any transfers from other city operations, like the sewer department, to assist in covering expenses.


  In the meantime, look for upcoming op-eds on our other records requests.

But it’s a mystery why DPH should ask hospitals to keep a lid on it without some kind of explanation. The Business Journal said it could not get a response from the DPH spokesperson about why the request was made to hospitals. But some hospital officials said they were ignoring it anyway.                                                                                    Dr. Eric Dickson, CEO of UMass Medical Health Care, told the Business Journal, “I don’t think there’s any benefit to keeping any of this a secret. There are still not enough people saying look, this is real.”                                                                                    The problem, as reported by our newspapers and media outlets across the state, has been that there are too few test kits available in too few places for too many who need to be tested. Whether the blame for this shortage falls on state health officials or elsewhere, the lack of preparedness still has to be acknowledged and dealt with. If the public is kept up to date about the increase — or decrease — in the number of positive cases and deaths from COVID-19, and has knowledge about where cases of the virus have hit hardest, they can better understand the seriousness of this pandemic.

The suggestion seemed to be that Trump wants to soon roll back the administration’s recommendations that Americans across the country strictly limit their in-person interactions with others outside of their homes. These recommendations have been superseded in many jurisdictions by stay-at-home orders, school closures, business closures, and limitations on the size of social gatherings. But if the Trump administration decides to advocate an end to social distancing, some localities may be inclined to follow suit — even though public health experts have warned that a premature cessation of the policy would be extremely dangerous.

European shares attempted another rebound on Tuesday as a fresh wave of monetary and fiscal stimulus halted a global selloff in equity markets, but growing evidence of the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic kept investors on edge. In a co-ordinated global effort to stabilise financial markets in one of the biggest routs on record, Germany launched a stimulus package of up to 750 billion euros, while the U.S. Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to shore up credit across the economy.All the major country indexes rose in early trading, with Germanys DAX, Spains IBEX and Londons FTSE 100 adding between 3.5 and 5.2. The pan-European STOXX 600 index jumped 4.2 and was set for its best day since August 2015. It is probably just a natural reaction to the extent of the losses in the last few sessions rather than any one thing, said Connor Campbell, analyst at spread better Spreadex in London.Theres always a caveat attached to the morning part of the European session because the U.S. session can change things so much that often the afternoon can be unrecognisable from the morning. After see-sawing about 3 to 4 in both directions last week, the benchmark European index is still down more than 30 since its record high last month in one of the fastest-ever turns to a bear market.With entire nations under lockdown foreshadowing more pain for factory activity and business confidence in the second quarter, investors have largely ignored macroeconomic data from the first quarter. On Tuesday, traders hardly reacted to figures showing euro zone business activity crumbling in March as shops, restaurants and offices pulled down the shutters.If the global economy is a tin bucket filled with water, the coronavirus outbreak has drilled multiple holes into it and monetary policy bazookas are unable to stop the water from leaking away, said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. The solution may have to be a new bucket, which in this instance is a cure to the coronavirus.Italian stocks surged 5.7, as latest numbers showing a slowdown in new cases of COVID-19 raised hopes that the most aggressive phase of the outbreak may be passing. Travel and leisure stocks, which have posted some of the heaviest losses this month, rose 3.4, while miners, insurers and oil and gas stocks jumped between 7 and 10.Frances Biomrieux was up 8.6 after the healthcare company won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its product aimed at testing for coronavirus. Europes fear gauge fell to 55.57, its lowest in nearly two weeks.

It might seem, at least on paper, that larger megapixel counts on phones would lead to better photos — or at least greater flexibility when shooting. The problem is these smaller sensors on phone cameras are squeezing pixels more tightly together, which can have consequences. First, there is a higher likelihood of noise creeping into the shot at higher ISO, and second, it adversely affects low-light shooting because smaller pixels mean less light hits the sensor in the first place.

"It's going to be a very tough situation, because you would hope you're able to race them and recoup some of the money that it's costing you to train them. And for some people, that is their livelihood," said Monmouth Park trainer James Frangella, who owns Eatontown TV & Appliance.                    "It's a tough time for everybody. I have a retail business, I have a skeleton crew and we have people coming in in dribs and drabs. Most are staying in lockdown."                    Then there's the fear of contracting the coronavirus. A backstretch worker at Belmont Park tested positive last week, which resulted in the cancellation of racing last Friday at Aqueduct, where horses that stable and train at Belmont Park run races throughout the winter and early spring.                    "We have a neighbor's horse - a standardbred - and we gave him one of our paddocks because he didn't want to continue going to Gaitway (Farm in Manalapan) because of the possibility of becoming infected," said Geri Kromann, a thoroughbred owner with a farm in Millstone. "So you do something for your neighbor, people-to-people, but he's just one person. And that horse is ready, because trotters used to run every week and now he is out of commission. So multiply that by the people anxiously waiting for Monmouth Park to open."                    It seems everyone has stories about the new reality the country is trying to deal with, understanding that the extreme measures are a necessity if there's any hope of racetracks reopening in the coming weeks.                    <video

The purpose of these drills is to help create a safer environment as well as teaching faculty and students how to be better prepared.  To help remember what to do during a lockdown, at the beginning of the drill the following message will be announced over the loud speakers: “Locks, lights, and out of sight.”  This is to remind students and staff to secure the location and also help protect those inside. “There will be no yelling, banging, SWAT, Fire trucks, ect… It will be similar to a fire drill,” says Sanders. Also, during the drills signs will be placed on each end of the building to let those outside know that there is a drill going on. It is important to remember that these drills are being done to help make campus safer.  As this is a learning process for everyone, Sanders explained that he will be taking suggestions on how to do it better for in the future.

  MACOMB -- McDonough County Public Transportation's point to point van service, known as \"demand response,\" carried 1,675 riders over 22 days in February. Vans carried 74 riders per day. There were 40 senior citizens riding every day as well as 29 disabled persons.


  Though the MCPT committee did not meet this month, the figures for February were supplied by interim transit director Suzan Nash.


  The vans made 32 out of town trips to take people to medical appointments. There were seven trips apiece to Quincy and Springfield, six trips to Peoria, four trips to Stronghurst, three trips to Galesburg, and one trip apiece to Monmouth, Carthage, Warsaw, Rushville, and Lewistown.


  Nash reported that Macomb's Go West bus system carried a cumulative total of 61,285 riders in February.

For instance, Papyvorus -- the animal you'll see the most through the game -- loves to eat scrunched up balls of paper. You can use them to lure the creatures, and they'll fight over the treats when they catch one. However, the multicoloured Predator will hunt Papyvorus, and you might need them to unlock the next part of the story, so you'll need to be careful about getting them through Predator territory. The game's puzzles aren't just about the wildlife -- they're often about the environment itself as well. Perhaps you need to move some water from one part of the map to another, or create a sandy bridge. These two elements will often go hand in hand, too, and you'll slowly be taught how each species fits into the ecosystem and how they can affect the landscape.

Apart from the aforementioned stimulators of the global pplication delivery network (ADN) market, factors such as the need to promote business agility and adapt to cost-control measures are looked upon as key drivers. The adoption of ADN solutions by SMBs is on the higher side as they are capable of lowering delivery time and producing well-planned networks. These solutions are also required by organizations from various industries to avoid the intrusion of virus into critical data and loss of information. The demand for control and security is another factor that will drive the global market on the back of the need for efficient delivery of applications. Today, there are a number of companies that are challenged by threats from web-based applications to their crucial business data.

Kapoor is 76 and COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, is particularly devastating to the elderly, as well as to those who have an underlying medical condition. The news site _Law360_ noted that there are concerns over whether or not the U.S. prison system is prepared for a pandemic like the current coronavirus. And it’s that concern that Kapoor and his legal team are hoping will keep the convicted pharmaceutical chief executive officer out of prison for the time being.

European shares attempted another rebound on Tuesday as a fresh wave of monetary and fiscal stimulus halted a global selloff in equity markets, but growing evidence of the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic kept investors on edge. In a co-ordinated global effort to stabilise financial markets in one of the biggest routs on record, Germany launched a stimulus package of up to 750 billion euros, while the U.S. Federal Reserve took unprecedented steps to shore up credit across the economy.                                                                    All the major country indexes rose in early trading, with Germany's DAX, Spain's IBEX and London's FTSE 100 adding between 3.5% and 5.2%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index jumped 4.2% and was set for its best day since August 2015. "It is probably just a natural reaction to the extent of the losses in the last few sessions rather than any one thing," said Connor Campbell, analyst at spread better Spreadex in London.                                                                    "There's always a caveat attached to the morning part of the European session because the U.S. session can change things so much that often the afternoon can be unrecognisable from the morning." After see-sawing about 3% to 4% in both directions last week, the benchmark European index is still down more than 30% since its record high last month in one of the fastest-ever turns to a bear market.                                                                    With entire nations under lockdown foreshadowing more pain for factory activity and business confidence in the second quarter, investors have largely ignored macroeconomic data from the first quarter. On Tuesday, traders hardly reacted to figures showing euro zone business activity crumbling in March as shops, restaurants and offices pulled down the shutters.                                                                    "If the global economy is a tin bucket filled with water, the coronavirus outbreak has drilled multiple holes into it and monetary policy bazookas are unable to stop the water from leaking away," said Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM. "The solution may have to be a new bucket, which in this instance is a cure to the coronavirus."                                                                    Italian stocks surged 5.7%, as latest numbers showing a slowdown in new cases of COVID-19 raised hopes that the most aggressive phase of the outbreak may be passing. Travel and leisure stocks, which have posted some of the heaviest losses this month, rose 3.4%, while miners, insurers and oil and gas stocks jumped between 7% and 10%.                                                                    France's Biomérieux was up 8.6% after the healthcare company won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its product aimed at testing for coronavirus. Europe's fear gauge fell to 55.57, its lowest in nearly two weeks.

At the time he was a cinematic artist at Blizzard, working on blockbusters like _StarCraft_ and _Diablo_ , and he was struck by the Xbox One game’s art style in particular. Its lush, 2D world looked like “a painting that had come to life,” he says. Eventually, he was given the chance to contribute to that world when he joined _Ori_ developer Moon Studios as art director on the game’s sequel. It was exciting but also daunting: how do you create a follow- up to one of the best-looking games ever made?

As things are changing in our state and country at a dizzying pace, I wanted to update you on what the Vermont Legislature is doing during this crisis. On March 13th, we adjourned the legislature for one week to allow for our IT department to come up with ways for us to meet remotely. If we did not do so, the legislature could have become a catalyst for the spread COVID-19 infections across the entire state. This Wednesday, March 25th, a small group of legislators will meet at the State House in Montpelier to vote to change our rules, allowing for both our committees as well as the House and Senate to vote remotely during the State of Emergency. This will allow the legislature to remain in session, to keep working on the budget, and change laws as necessary for the continued functioning of our State.                                                            Before adjourning, the House passed legislation that would hold harmless any employer that was forced to lay off employees as a result of COVID-19, and also remove the work search requirement for anyone who has been laid off. The reason for that is we need certain businesses to close their doors to aid in social distancing in the effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. This is a disease that no one has an immunity to and for which we have no treatment. Therefore we absolutely must keep infection below the capacity of the hospitals to treat severe cases, in order to “flatten the curve” and prevent even more people from dying.                                                            The actions Governor Scott has taken to prevent the COVID-19 spread is unprecedented and I support his actions. It is in times of crisis such as these that political differences must be put aside in order put our neighbor’s health and survival as our first priority. We uniquely have it within us to make it through this crisis and to emerge a stronger and more resilient community than we were before.                                                             _Rep.

Metallica have announced that they have been forced to push back their upcoming stadium tour of South America to December instead of this spring due to the current coronavirus pandemic.
                    In the U.S. the band also shared the bad news that several music festivals that they were set to headline have been canceled including Epicenter, Welcome to Rockville and Sonic Temple, but the Louder Than Life will go on with an additional date added.                    Greta Van Fleet will still be supporting Metallica on the rescheduled South American dates. The metal legends had this to say, "Greetings . . . not from our usual HQ haunts, but this time from our living rooms, bedrooms and basements. As many of you know, in our nearly forty years of touring, we've had a few mishaps along the way; broken bones, trashed appendixes, a pyro mishap, backs thrown out, crazy weather, food poisoning (beware of the oysters!) and even one way next-level anxiety attack! None of it has ever stopped us, but this is obviously a very different time and leaving the house now literally means taking your life in your hands. Unfortunately, in these surreal times that means we have to stay away from each other for the foreseeable future before we can start thinking about 'Tallica family reunions around the world.                    "We're all putting safety first, self-isolating and socially distancing, but not forever! With that said, the South American shows originally planned for April are in the process of moving to December, Greta Van Fleet is going to stay on board to take this ride with us, and we'll be hitting each and every city, but a few venues may have changed. We'll be back later this week with the new dates and details about tickets, venues and everything you need to know to help you make plans.                         "For those of you in the States, you know that we have some festival dates planned in May and unfortunately the news is not quite as good. With heavy hearts, we're here to let you know that Epicenter in Charlotte, Welcome to Rockville in Daytona and Sonic Temple in Columbus have all been cancelled. There is one bright note; Louder Than Life in Louisville (September 17 - 20) has ADDED a date and we're excited that we'll once again be able to partake in the festivities as we'll be hitting the stage on Thursday, September 17th to kick off what will be four days of live music and good vibes. Additional headliners for the remainder of Louder Than Life will be announced at a later date, please head over to https://dannywimmerpresents.com for all the information. Details regarding refunds and exchanges for the May shows will also be available there this Thursday, March 26th.

BOSTON -- Massachusetts' youngest residents, their parents, and the workforce that cares for them began facing a new landscape Monday, when early education providers across the state were officially shuttered under an emergency order.                    The order Gov. Charlie Baker issued last Wednesday -- one of several aimed at stemming the spread of the new coronavirus and promoting social distancing practices -- temporarily closes all early education providers across the state, effective from 11:59 p.m. Sunday until at least April 6.                    Baker's order allowed for the operation of emergency child care programs with priority access to such programs for "vulnerable children and children of families who work to maintain the health, safety and welfare of all Commonwealth residents."                    For early education providers and workers, the last few days have been a period of transition, ironing out what an emergency model looks like, what steps can be taken to protect the health of staff and families, and how to ensure the system is ready to return to full operations after a closure that could potentially last beyond two weeks.                    "We're in an unknown world," Bill Eddy, executive director of the Massachusetts Association for Early Education and Care, said in an interview.                    The trade association for private, community-based early education programs and before- and after-school providers in Massachuestts, Eddy's group represents more than 600 early education centers, school age providers and 43 family child care systems.                    Eddy said there are "two real questions" facing the system as it shifts into "shutdown mode."                    "How many children are there really that parents will choose, this is what they want to do?" he said. "The second question is, can we find enough early educators that will work to really staff these centers? We hope so."                    On Saturday, the state published a list of more than 300 center-based and home-based providers that will operate on an emergency, drop-in basis for instances "when all other non-group-care settings have been exhausted and families have no other options."                    "We expect more to come online eventually, but this needs to be implemented safely and the sites should only really be used as a last resort," Baker said in a Saturday press conference.                    The list includes contact information and hours of operation, along with a note advising that priority will be given to groups including "health care workers, essential state and human service workers, COVID-19 health workers, grocery store employees, emergency response personnel, law enforcement, transportation and infrastructure workers, sanitation workers, DCF-involved families, and families living in shelters."                    Eddy said the groups of children he's most concerned about are the children of first responders, the children of essential health care employees and the "8,000 children in this commonwealth who are in our care because they are in the custody of the Department of Children and Families" due to abuse and neglect.                    "The most stable aspects of their lives are the 10 and a half hours they spend in our programs," Eddy said, referring to DCF-involved children. "Those are the ones we really, really want to keep an eye on."                    He said his group is suggesting that providers reach out to those children and their families to see if there's any way possible they remain in their early education program.                    "We feel some sort of special mission that we need to be the stability, we need to be the safety net for those children, and we want to make sure they're not lost in this tough climate," he said.                    U.S. Reps. Katherine Clark, Joseph Kennedy III and Ayanna Pressley were among a group of Congress members who wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Friday, asking for an investment of at least $21 billion in child care funding to states as part of a third stimulus package.                    Citing a National Association for the Education of Young Children survey of more than 6,000 providers that showed 30 percent would not survive a closure of more than two weeks, the lawmakers said that more providers will be forced to permanently close their doors the longer the crisis lasts.                    "Moreover, providers who stay open to support essential workers in health care, grocery, transportation, and other critical industries often lack the resources necessary for additional cleaning supplies, staff hazard pay, substitute teachers, paid sick leave, and health-related training," they wrote.                    Eddy said there is a key difference between the Massachusetts early education system and the other two components of the state's education secretariat. While the workers in public K-12 schools and public higher education are public employees, early education is typically provided through private, community based programs.                    "At the end of the day, if we have to lay off all our early educators if the rates aren't paid, we're looking at a tough system to rebuild," he said.

In what was the single biggest day in the 2020 campaign so far, March 3’s “Super Tuesday,” made it clear the directions in which Democrats hope to take the country and their party: one toward a “political revolution” and the other toward a “return to decency.” Biden swept 10 of the 14 contests that day, carrying plenty of states that helped win Clinton the nomination four years ago (Alabama, Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas). He even pulled off surprise victories in places that Sanders won last time around (Minnesota, Oklahoma and Maine). The night was not a total disaster for Senator Sanders, however. He won his home state of Vermont as well as Colorado, Utah, and the biggest prize of the night, California.

The Gujarat government has decided to keep all schools closed and promote students of Classes 1 to 9 and 11 of the state board, as the annual exams this year could not be conducted due to the coronavirus crisis, officials said on Tuesday. The board exams for Classes 10 and 12 were already conducted by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board earlier this month.However, the exams for other standards could not be conducted as schools were already closed by the government from March 15 to check the spread of coronavirus. The decision to promote the students to higher standards was taken by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, said Ashwani Kumar, secretary in the Chief Ministers Office.Since schools were asked to remain shut, the chief minister has decided to give mass promotion to students of Classes 1 to 9 and 11. This was necessary to keep the children safe, Kumar told reporters in Gandhinagar. The Gujarat government on Monday declared a statewide lockdown till the end of this month.

Admittedly, it isn’t a _perfect_ masterpiece. As an adaptation, it’s almost a complete failure. The only thing it really shares with Moore’s comics is the basic premise, in which characters from various works of literature — Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo, Mina Harker, Dorian Gray, Jekyll and Hyde, Tom Sawyer, and an invisible man — band together to prevent the outbreak of a world war. (Moore and artist Kevin O’Neill have disavowed the film.) But that doesn’t mean it’s a complete failure. It’s the last vestige of the silly, unaffected action movies of the late ’90s and early 2000 — it has “Brendan Fraser’s version of _The Mummy_ ” DNA. It’s big, silly, and entertaining, and even its most naked franchise ambitions feel fun rather than frustrating, because they’re so blatant. (The film’s final image, where lightning strikes the trembling grave of a dead main character, is hardly subtle.)

Note that those numbers include the sales of both streaming boxes _and_ TVs running Roku’s, Amazon’s, or Google’s software. But they still show that even though Google may be keeping Amazon from powering more smart TVs, both of the tech giants still have a long way to go to overtake Roku.

My family contacted a Syrian lady doctor, an expert in infectious diseases, and a sister of my friend in Damascus. I sent photo-images of my eyes. She saw, asked for symptoms and prescribed some powerful oral antibiotics and drops. I managed to convince a Hong Kong pharmacist to sell the medicine over the counter: I said it was a matter of life and death. She understood.

Though Dolores, Bernard, and whoever is actually inside the head of the Charlotte Hale clone host appear to be running in parallel, it’s plausible that one, if not all three, are operating at different points in the aftermath of the park. But the most intriguing thread of the story, and a plot line primed for a big reveal moment, has to do with Caleb, the just-getting-by worker bee played by _Breaking Bad_ ’s Aaron Paul. Nolan, who co-wrote and directed the premiere, introduces the show’s new protagonist in a similar fashion to the hosts in season 1. From a God’s eye view, Caleb “wakes up” and steps into his manmade loop, clocking in and clocking out of his construction job while juggling personal drama on the side. To make ends meet, Caleb resorts to an app called Rico, which provides him with for-hire crimes for cash.

Fans of _The Office_ know that Carell left the series after Season 7, but the details surrounding his departure were never crystal clear. The oral history changes that, and very little is left to interpretation. Those who worked closely with Carell explained that he was fully prepared to continue his role as Michael Scott, but after poor communication on the network's end (no one offered him a new season contract) he decided not to renew. Carell didn't _want_ to leave the show, and his fellow cast members were so upset that they could barely get through filming the farewell episode.

Italy believes the euro zones bailout fund should be deployed without restrictions within the bloc to manage economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, its Deputy Economy Minister said on Tuesday. Italy has borne the brunt of the outbreak in Europe, and Antonio Misiani told Reuters that no conditions should be attached to using the ESM fund to combat it - potentially putting Rome at loggerheads with richer northern euro zone nations and some legislators in Rome.Euro zone finance ministers are on Tuesday due to discuss proposals by the European Commission to deploy the fund, which has 410 billion euros 444 billion of unused lending power, as a coronavirus cushion. The only acceptable conditionality is that of using the ESM resources to manage the health and economic emergency, said Misiani, a member of the co-governing centre-left Democratic Party.That confirmed earlier comments from an Italian government source. In a bid to stop a pandemic-induced financial rout from shredding the euro zones economy, the European Central Bank last week launched a 750-billion-euro emergency bond purchase programme and said it was ready to do more if necessary.The ESM could unlock unlimited ECB sovereign bond purchases through the Outright Monetary Transactions programme OMT. To provide the credit, the ESM would have to borrow on the market via what officials say would be called coronabonds, to make clear money from the operation would go only towards fighting the effects of the epidemic.Currently, the ESM can help euro zone countries only on condition they adjust their economic policies to overcome the problems that lead them to seek financial assistance. Both Germany and the Netherlands have said they do not favour ESM loans without such conditions.Several Italian lawmakers from the co-ruling 5-Star Movement and right-wing opposition parties also expressed opposition, raising concerns that any kind of ESM support would place tougher fiscal obligations on Rome and impinge on national sovereignty. ESM doesnt work. Using this instrument to take on a debt for decades is absolutely not in our interests, Raphael Raduzzi, a 5-Star member of the parliamentary finance committee, told Reuters.More people have died of COVID-19 in Italy than in any other country. The toll rose by 602 on Monday to 6,077. Italys Treasury has estimated its economy will contract at least 3 this year due to the lockdown imposed to fight the outbreak, sources said last week, while stressing that the situation was highly uncertain and subject to downside risks.1  0.9236 euros
