“When backed up against a wall, dig deep, demand excellence, stand tall, and be strong.”
 “Whenever faced with a challenge, I dig deep within myself and summon my spiritual and physical forces. This gives me the focus, determination, perseverance, and support I need to succeed.”
 During times of extreme difficulty, it is paramount for each of us to dig deeper within the inner recesses of our souls to keep going. Those times when we are stretched to the limits emotionally, physically and spiritually. Those times when we are tempted to surrender and give into the weaknesses that we yielded to in past moments of failure. We must not quit. We need a better option….
 Today can be the beginning of a brand new way forward. To develop an indomitable spirit. The spirit that fights; tries harder; bristles its backbone and juts its jaw in determination. The spirit that stares down the opposition and digs deep for the forces that will defeat the foe. Let us not be discouraged. Rather let us stand tall and strong and focus on the goal. You are stronger than you think. But it begins within your heart.
 Determine this week to do things you have never done before. You will learn that by digging deep and resolving in your heart, you can climb the mountain, slay the dragon and cross the finish line in victory. Our faith in the risen, glorified Christ will ascertain our victory. We can do ALL things through Christ who strengthens His children!
 The crossroad! Let us choose the road that the Lord leads us, as we fight the good fight of faith and overcome all obstacles for His glory!
 Have a great week and remember, God loves YOU!

Republican leaders began to increase their pushback to Gov. Jay Inslee’s “stay-home” order on Wednesday, even as public health officials continue to say that social-distancing measures are crucial to keeping the spread of the novel coronavirus under control.
 On Wednesday, the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives, who’s been supportive of Inslee throughout the crisis, announced his frustration and said he would begin objecting, in some instances, to Inslee’s executive orders. Meantime, the GOP-backed sheriff of Snohomish County announced he would not enforce Inslee’s stay-home directive. A Republican candidate for governor sued Inslee in federal court, arguing the order violates First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom, assembly and free speech.
 And a Republican representative who had talked about “starting a rebellion” against parts of Inslee’s order drew objections from law enforcement
 House Minority Leader J.T. Wilcox, R-Yelm, said he was disappointed that Inslee, in his speech Tuesday night, didn’t announce a schedule for when restrictions would begin to be lifted, nor did he say what specific metrics he would be consulting.
 “It didn’t seem like a plan,” Wilcox said in an interview. “A plan includes facts, includes targets. He didn’t share any of that.”
 Republicans in the Legislature have pushed for Inslee to allow residential construction, elective medical procedures and outdoor activities like hunting and fishing to resume.
 Inslee said Wednesday that, depending on data he expects to receive Thursday, he hopes to start easing those restrictions in the next few days. He said that federal standards say that 14 straight days of falling infection numbers is necessary before restrictions are eased, a metric Washington has not yet met.
 “I’m afraid the situation is that some folks have decided to follow the siren demands of Donald Trump rather than the health of Washingtonians,” Inslee said. “We don’t want Washingtonians to get sick, that’s what this is all about.”
 Wilcox, who has almost uniformly backed the unprecedented actions Inslee has taken to slow the spread of the virus, said he would no longer be so supportive. While he said Inslee has the legal authority to extend his order, Wilcox said he would no longer grant blanket approval — without first conferring with his caucus — to some other minor suspensions of state law that the governor has put in place. Those suspensions, like waiving the one-week waiting period for unemployment insurance, require legislative approval, which, so far, has been granted simply with the approval of both parties’ legislative leaders.
 Wilcox said that Inslee’s lack of specificity threatens “the mandate of the public that he needs for truly effective orders now and in the future.
 “I am deeply concerned about the fact that he depends on the motivation of everyday citizens to comply and you motivate people by giving them goals and letting them be part of the decision,” Wilcox said. “And we all risk a worse result because he’s not willing to communicate with any precision.”
 In Snohomish County, Sheriff Adam Fortney late Tuesday announced that he would not enforce Inslee’s stay-home order because he thinks it violates constitutional rights, a move that was quickly denounced by the county’s executive, prosecutor and public health district.
 “The impacts of COVID-19 no longer warrant the suspension of our constitutional rights,” the first-term sheriff, who took office in January, wrote on his campaign’s Facebook page. Sheriff is a nonpartisan position, but Fortney’s campaign was supported by the local Republican Party. Fortney, an avowed defender of gun rights, also complained in his lengthy social-media post that marijuana retailers are considered “essential” businesses and can remain open, while gun shops are not.
 Fortney used a news conference Wednesday to pile additional criticism on Inslee, while acknowledging he had never attempted to talk to the governor, the county executive, the county’s elected prosecutor or Snohomish County health officials before offering his critique. All of them responded to his post by urging residents to stay at home.
 Functionally speaking, little will change as a result of Fortney’s proclamation. Around the state, enforcement of Inslee’s order has taken the form of guidance and nudges, rather than any official action, even though it is legally enforceable. The Washington State Patrol hasn’t issued a single citation for violations of the order. Neither has the Seattle Police Department. Inslee said there had been only one enforcement action statewide, and that was against a landlord who was threatening tenants with eviction.
 “Our best enforcement strategy is engagement and education,” said Chris Loftis, a spokesman for the State Patrol. “This is like most of the laws; it only works if people agree with them.”
 Fortney on Wednesday said that Snohomish County deputies have not arrested or cited anyone for violating the stay-at-home or social-distancing orders or for opening a business prematurely, and said they won’t while he remains sheriff.
 “We are the Snohomish County sheriff’s office,” he said. “We don’t go around and enforce whether your business is open. We don’t want people out, but we are not going to make a physical arrest.”
 Snohomish County Prosecuting Attorney Adam Cornell said he feared Fortney’s comments would be interpreted as license “to willfully and blatantly violate the law.”
 “Any attempt to undermine that authority is both irresponsible, unhelpful in these difficult times,” Cornell said. “A violation of the law carries consequences and as county prosecutor I will continue to uphold my oath and exercise my prosecutorial discretion.”
 Fortney, at his news briefing, dismissed any suggestion that his comments might lead to civil unrest. “I don’t think we’re anywhere near that,” he said.
 Meanwhile, the State Patrol on Wednesday announced the arrest and criminal charges against a Mill Creek man, Shawn Roland, who is accused of leaving a message threatening to kill Inslee, his staff and “their accomplices” for “violating the constitutional rights of citizens,” said Loftis.
 Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, without mentioning Fortney by name, said prematurely easing restrictions would “be playing Russian roulette with the lives of those we are charged to protect.”
 And the Snohomish Health District issued a statement urging residents to “stay the course.”
 “We all want to open businesses back up as soon as possible, but now is not yet that time,” health officials wrote. In Snohomish County, 2,188 people have been confirmed to have COVID-19, including 100 who have died, according to figures released Wednesday by the state Department of Health. The new numbers bring Washington’s total number of coronavirus infections to 12,494, including 692 deaths.
 Republican Party Chairman Caleb Heimlich declined to take a position on Fortney’s announcement, but said Inslee “is choosing not to lead in a way to bring people together.”
 “People want to see direction, they want to see a path out of this,” Heimlich said.
 Joshua Freed, a former mayor of Bothell and one of a half-dozen Republican gubernatorial candidates battling to challenge Inslee in the fall, sued the governor in federal court on Wednesday, saying his order banning gatherings has disrupted the weekly Bible study group that Freed holds.
 “If a Washington citizen can visit a marijuana shop or grocery store to buy goods in a responsible and socially distanced manner, how are they not allowed to practice faith-based activities and have spiritual fellowship using the same precautions?” Freed said in a news release announcing the lawsuit.
 Inslee, in response, said that it’s still too risky for people to gather in groups, even for religious services and that houses of worship across the state have been successful in moving their services online.
 He said he is “very confident” that his orders are compliant with the Constitution.
 Both Freed and Fortney cited a Sunday protest in Olympia that drew more than 2,000 people, and at which the State Patrol issued no tickets for the mass gathering. Freed attended the rally, as did other Republican candidates and officials. It was part of a spurt of protest nationally, nurtured along by some of the same national conservative groups that helped fuel the Tea Party movement.
 The actions of one Republican representative at the rally raise the hackles of law enforcement.
 Rep. Robert Sutherland, R-Granite Falls, urged those gathered to start a revolt if state officials tried to enforce the temporary ban on recreational fishing.
 “You send your goons with guns, we will defend ourselves,” he said.
 Thurston County Sheriff John Snaza, president of the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, wrote to Sutherland asking him to clarify if he was advocating violence against law enforcement.
 “We’re out there to save lives and protect and serve, and here he is calling us goons,” Snaza said.
 “These ‘goons’ were present during your ‘speech’ protecting your right to assemble and speak,” Lewis County Prosecutor Jonathan Meyer wrote in a letter to Sutherland. “Rhetoric is one thing, inflammatory mindless rhetoric is another and puts people in danger.”
 Seattle Times staff reporters Joseph O’Sullivan, Jim Brunner, Christine Clarridge and news researcher Miyoko Wolf contributed to this story.

Wife Anna, if she decides to start another career after the danger passes, could be a “hairly-decent” tonsorial artist. She went to work on my naturally wiry locks with the aid of a thinning scissors and voila! This is one time I welcomed a trimming from meine frau. Danke schon, dear!
 In the midst of watching the gloom and doom news reports, our spirits were buoyed by a rather unexpected surprise. Anna happened to check our Credit Union account and apparently our stimulus checks buoyed our sinking checking account to the tune of $2,400. We thought us old folk living on love and Social Security would be among the last to receive this government gift, if at all.
 This “mini-windfall” was especially welcomed one day after receiving a report on my retirement IRA that took a major financial beating for the last quarter, a grim reminder of what happened to our pension funds in 2008 and onward as we both were anticipating retirement back then. The high financial anxiety was no fun, then or now.
 Another unforeseen event: If our bathroom scales are right, it appears that I’ve already lost 6-7 pounds since this pestilence reared its ugly invisible head. I attribute it to some changes in my eating habits, ingesting more healthy comestibles, drinking more water and fewer soft drinks, not eating out, daily rounds on the treadmill and keeping Reese’s peanut butter cups at bay.
 With each passing day, I’m analyzing myself, my routines, my aspirations and realizing how too much of what I do is done without thinking how my actions affect those close to me and beyond. And that’s a good thing, I believe, if I take some corrective steps that include being more thankful for God’s beneficence that in turn translates into greater service to my fellow human beings.
 This coincides with sentiments expressed in the late Glen Campbell’s song, “Less of Me,” that asserts, “Let me be a little kinder, let me be a little blinder, to the faults of those about me, let me praise a little more. Let me be when I am weary, just a little bit more cheery, let me think more of my neighbor, and a little less of me.”
 Yea, verily ... So let it be written (and sung), so let it be done ...

Dear Lacey,
 It’s been my experience that when it comes to family, words don’t always do the trick. There’s an old saying that goes, “Those convinced against their will are of the same opinion still.” Some people have been brainwashed into believing credit cards and debt are an unavoidable part of life. They’re stuck in their ways, and nothing anyone can say or do is going to change that.
 I’ve been fortunate enough to help millions of people change their lives, get out of debt and take control of their finances. But there are millions more who will never listen. They’ll just keep going deeper and deeper into debt, and never realize the real problem is the person they see in the mirror every morning.

The UK has now been in lockdown for an entire month, seeing strict rules put into place in order to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. If you were wondering how long these rules and social distancing guidelines might be in place for, unfortunately it looks as though they might be sticking around for quite some time.      During last night's daily press conference, Professor Chris Whitty, the government's chief medical advisor, said it was "wholly unrealistic" for anyone to expect life will return to normal any time son. Gulp. He also warned that the likelihood of having a "highly effective vaccine" within the next calendar year was "incredibly small". Err, yeah, not the news we were all hoping for really.  
 "This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear," he continued. "So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally... for the foreseeable future."
 Professor Whitty also explained that "in the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally... a vaccine... or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people."

 These are subcompact sedans, so don't expect a ton of space in any of these three. And while we don't have final specs for the new Audi A3 just yet, we do know what its competitors bring to the table.
 When it comes to headroom, the Mercedes outdoes the BMW, but not by a ton. The Merc offers front passengers 40.3 inches of noggin room, and the folks in the back get 37.2 inches. The BMW, comparatively, offers 39.8 inches in the front and 35.7 inches out back. Based on design alone, our guess is that the Audi would likely split the difference between the two.
 Legroom is another critical component, and up front, the Mercedes wins again with 41.8 inches to the Bimmer's 41.4. In the rear, things are reversed, with BMW giving passengers slightly more room to stretch their stems. The 2 Series provides 34.4 inches of rear legroom, while the Mercedes only offers 33.9 inches.

The most decisive thing that can be said about Better Call Saul season 6 is that no one really knows when we're going to get to see it. Season 5 managed to come out on time and was aired without interruptions as Alec Bojalad from Den of Geek stated largely because it was taken care of in 2019. But unfortunately season 6 production fell within the COVID-19 era and as a lot of shows have already found out it's kind of tough to keep filming when there's a shutdown happening across the board when it comes to the entertainment industry. Plus, the idea that as of now the writers don't see the end coming in the way they might have predicted is twisting things up even further since despite the idea that one day the series would have to coincide with Breaking Bad, there's still been a lot of ground to cover and a lot of story to tell. What's amusing about this is that those that believed they had everything clocked and all angles predicted and planned out might have failed to realize that a story can and often does go where it wants regardless of whatever plans were made to insure that it goes ahead as scheduled. That's the nature of a story, much like a child it tries to buck control at times and goes off on its own in a way that some folks don't understand and can't fully comprehend. Those of us that have seen it happen more than once however tend to think that it's a good thing so long as we can guide it and coax it back to where it needs to be. Trying to force a story back into form is almost never a good idea since that's how it ends up feeling, forced and unnatural. Sometimes you've got to let the story flow in a way that will bring it back to center eventually, but on different terms.

 Since that first mask, Dehmey has made more than 150 of them, the majority donated or given away to those in need. She has sold some for $5 along the way in order to help cover expenses for ribbon, thread and bobbins — she has plenty of fabric thanks to donations from family members.
 Dehmey has taken mask orders from others through posting on her personal Facebook page and by word of mouth. When an order is completed, she leaves the masks in a basket on the front porch outside her family’s home.
 “One guy was saying he needed a mask to wear while he took his partner to dialysis,” Dehmey said. “I made him one and told him to come by my house and pick it up.”
 Dehmey isn’t quite sure where the giving side of her comes from. But she’s been helping others for years.

This show almost makes a person wonder if there's going to be another spinoff in the works at some point since a lot of people don't want to see the Breaking Bad arc end and would prefer to see the points of view of many other characters, but hopefully it ends with Better Call Saul. It's been a wild ride since a poor chemistry teacher started cooking up meth with one of his failed students, and its been enjoyable to watch Jimmy tread down the path that would eventually bring him into contact with Walter and Jesse. But it kind of needs to stop after this show, even though others might feel otherwise. There are a lot of characters to explore, that's for certain, but stretching it out any further, dissecting each and every narrative that can be pulled from the main story, feels as though it could be a bad idea. Time will tell obviously what those in charge want to do with it, but with the end of Breaking Bad and the eventual end of Better Call Saul it does feel as though it's time to lay it all to rest.

(AP) - The latest Nation’s Report Card gives eighth-grade students unsatisfactory marks in U.S. history, geography and civics.The assessments, given for the first time digitally on tablets instead of paper, were administered from January to March 2018. History and geography scores on the assessments were lower than in the last round of tests in 2014 and civics scores didn't move, according to results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress released Thursday.Also troubling, administrators said, was that lower-performing students lost more ground than middle- and higher- performing students, mirroring a pattern seen in recent reading and math scores. The problem is likely to be made worse by the loss of class time caused by the coronavirus, which is expected to have a greater impact on lower-performing students.The pattern "should motivate us all to address the factors behind these declines for struggling students," said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for NAEP.Across all three subjects, a quarter or less of students scored at or above proficient, meaning they showed a solid understanding of challenging concepts. Another quarter or more failed to demonstrate a level of basic understanding, the results showed. The score gaps between white students and their black and Hispanic peers didn't significantly change."Our nation is experiencing a teachable moment with the current health crisis in terms of how important it is to understand historical forces, the role of our civic institutions, and the impact of geographical conditions of our interconnected world," said Peggy Carr, associate commissioner at the National Center for Education Statistics. "The results provided here indicate that many students are struggling to understand and explain the importance of civic participation, how American government functions, the historical significance of events, and the need to grasp and apply core geographic concepts."The tests were administered to a total of 42,700 eighth-grade students in 780 public and private schools across the nation.The average U.S. history score was 263 out of 500 in 2018, four points lower than in 2014. The results categorized 15% of eighth-graders as proficient when asked, for example, to explain the significance of certain documents and ideas in American history. History scores declined across the board for white, black and Hispanic students, the results showed.The average geography score was 258 on a 500-point scale, three points lower than in 2014, with scores for white and black students showing declines. In 2018, 25% of students scored at or above the proficient level. The 2018 civics score measuring students' knowledge of government was unchanged between 2014 and 2018. About 24% of students scored at or above proficient, and there was no significant change across ethnic groups.There has been improvement over time since the assessments were first administered in the 1990s. Civics and history scores have gone up overall and the score gap between white and Hispanic students in civics has narrowed by 10 points. Score differences also have narrowed between white students and black and Hispanic students in geography, but the gaps in history scores have remained about the same.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

That's the great part with Better Call Saul since it's highlighted a tale that was happening before and during the rise of Walter White, and while it eventually gets hemmed in by Breaking Bad's story line due to already being a part of the whole, BCS is still its own entity at this point and remains one of the more appreciated shows of its time. As far as what can be expected content-wise from the upcoming season one thing is certain, Jimmy's involvement with the cartel have definitely begun and whether or not he and Kim are going to come to a head or an agreement over the current scheme he's trying to run will be a big point of interest as well. Things are definitely setting up in a way that fans didn't fully expect but are willing to follow to the end since season 6 will be the last season of BCS before it links up with Breaking Bad, thereby closing that arc. As Chris Agar of Screenrant states the rising tensions between Nacho, Lalo, and Gus Fring are going to have to come to a head at some point, even though every fan of the original show knows the Gus does survive for quite some time after the incident that should be coming. There are plenty of things that we already know from watching Breaking Bad, but there are a few gaps to close up before the final season is over and done with and people are going to be grinding away at the rumor mill once again until the next season of BCS comes out. Unfortunately that might not be until around 2021 given that things are still shut down and there's no definitive word that they'll be coming up anytime soon.

Our first responders and health care workers are on the front lines, risking their own lives while saving others. We owe them a debt of gratitude that we’ll never be able to repay. I tip my mantle to other silent stars — the custodians, housekeepers and others working relentlessly to keep facilities disinfected. And, let’s “honk if you love truckers,” postal workers and carriers, school teachers, social workers (our daughter among them) still in the trenches, and small businesses reaching out to others even as their own enterprises are in jeopardy. Will these kinds of second-mile, good Samaritan efforts continue for the long haul? I pray so.
 Many have commented on the irony of plunging gas prices — $1.69 a gallon as of this writing — at the same time that “we ain’t goin’ nowhere.” One Facebook comment pretty much nailed it: “I feel like I’m 16 again. Gas is cheap, and I’m grounded!”
 I have made a few “trips” locally, mainly for certain food and health care items, and am heartened by how many people are wearing masks and observing social distancing protocols. Toilet paper, tissues and wipes are back on shelves and “panic shopping” for the most part seems to have subsided.
 One of the strange (of many) behaviors I’m experiencing is waking up mornings with a different song ricocheting down my cobwebbed cranium. It might be Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” (we line dance to this tune) or B.J. Thomas’ “Rock and Roll Lullaby,” followed by a sacred melody from the “Life Songs No. 2” hymnal from my youth at Doylestown (Pa.) Mennonite Church. And so, I sing them over again in the shower as “Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head.”
 I continue to be grateful for this continued scrumptious spring weather that permits my spending considerable time outdoors — planting garden, pruning bushes, mowing and mulching our three-quarter acre property — therapeutic activities all. Adequate food, a roof over our heads, a loving family that lives close by and a caring church community and small group provide hope in the midst of the havoc wrought by this cruel coronavirus.

They might not be sales superstars, but small luxury sedans are great. The German trio of the new Audi A3, BMW 228i Gran Coupe and Mercedes-Benz A220 are all solid choices.
 All three of these contenders go for around $40,000, but which one is right for you? Here's a look at how these subcompact offerings compare on paper.
 ## Drivetrains
 The Audi A3 uses Quattro all-wheel drive, and though we're still waiting on confirmation of which engines we'll be getting here in the US, we know that it'll be some sort of turbocharged I4 mated to an automatic transmission, producing between 200 and 300 horsepower. There is a strong likelihood that we'll get the A3 with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, too.
 The babiest Benz' base model is the front-wheel drive A220. For some extra greenbacks, you can get Mercedes' 4Matic all-wheel drive system. The standard engine is a 2.0-liter I4 that puts out 188 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch transmission is the only available gearbox. If you want more power, you need to step up to the A35.
 The BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe's base trim is the 228i xDrive model, which uses all-wheel drive (but is based on front-wheel-drive architecture). There is also no manual transmission available. The output from the 2.0-liter turbo I4 is a respectable 228 hp and 258 lb-ft, though, so that's a bright spot. Like the A-Class, the 2 Series Gran Coupe is available with more power, in the form of the M235i.

Some say the Saudi-Russia price warriors miscalculated America’s response. President Trump used threats like hefty oil tariffs to secure a new Opec Plus deal to cut production by 10% on April 12. This was bolstered by production cuts from other G20 countries. Yet prices kept falling: arguably the deal was more about allowing Americans to save face rather than seriously committing to production cuts, and therefore higher prices and stability.

Kim Sandum, who serves on the capital improvement plan advisory subcommittee and represents Alliance for the Shenandoah Valley, submitted a concern that the plan prioritizes a $1 million amphitheater and $7 million recreation center at Rockingham Park at the Crossroads but excluded plans to improve pedestrian and bicycle access.
 “Pedestrian access across Spotswood Trail should be addressed before the amphitheater and recreation center projects, both of which will add to the current parking problems,” she wrote in an email. She also suggested funding a preliminary engineering study of building an overpass or underpass to allow bicycle and pedestrian access from homes on the other side of U.S. 33, and voiced concern that an amphitheater would attract noise, crowds and trash that would negatively impact neighboring farms.
 The $180 million plan was proposed at the previous meeting on April 8, which Chairman Bill Kyger said offers a placeholder for project expenditures, rather than approval of funding.
 John and Cindy Reeves also submitted a comment on Monday asking the budget reflect Gov. Ralph Northam’s budget “timeout” and wrote in the email concerns related to setbacks spanning years or generations.

LONDON -- Life is unlikely to return to normal even when the tighest coronavirus restrictions are lifted and social distancing measures could be in place for the rest of this year and beyond, Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Thursday.
 "A return to normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future… What we will be seeking to do is find a new normal - a way of living alongside this virus but in a form that keeps it under control," Sturgeon said at a news conference.
 "Social distancing and limiting our contacts with others will be a fact of life for a long time to come, certainly until treatments and ultimately a vaccine offer different solutions. So that means possibly for the rest of this year, and maybe even beyond." (Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Guy Faulconbridge)
