Kysre Gondrezick scored 20 points, and Madisen Smith passed out eight assists.
 “I thought Esmery rebounded the heck out of the ball. She’s a sophomore. She’s only going to continue to get better,” Carey said after Thursday win. “I thought Kysre was really efficient. She had 20 points, assists, steals, all that. I thought she was very efficient on that. Madisen had eight assists. We just didn’t have it all night. It was just slow all night.”
 Carey called the performance “sloppy.”
 “I hate these kinds of games. We came in here, and we weren’t executing. (We were) sloppy,” the veteran coach stated. “They were sagging, but part of it is my fault. It’s partially my fault because I told them I don’t want any quick threes. We were open all night at the three, but I just didn’t want a bunch to sit there and shoot a bunch of threes, so we forced some things. Defensively, I let them switch one through four. That’s over. I’ll never let that happen again,” Carey said.
 The Mountaineers had to be much better to defeat the Lady Vols, and they were.
 Gondrezick poured in 27 points, a career high, and Smith added a season-best 16 points. Kirsten Dean (11), Kari Niblack (10) and Martinez (10) also were in double figures.
 WVU opened the game on a 10-4 run as Gondrezick scored six points and Martinez four, but Tennessee scored the next five points to close the gap.

The military official said that the Pentagon will look at other ways to make up for the loss of the Nimitz when the carrier does leave the region.
 Trump's troop withdrawal decision got a cool reception from Republican lawmakers and allies, who warned of the dangers of reducing forces before security conditions are right. And it came despite arguments from senior military officials who favor a slower pullout to preserve hard-fought gains.
 Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, top U.S. commander for the Middle East, has long argued for a consistent aircraft carrier presence in the Gulf region to deter Iran.
 Visiting the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman in the North Arabian Sea in February, McKenzie told the sailors: "You're here because we don't want a war with Iran and nothing makes a potential adversary think twice about war than the presence of an aircraft carrier and the strike group that comes with it."
 Despite widespread demands for U.S. Navy ships in other parts of the world, McKenzie requested and received a much larger than usual naval presence in the Middle East region throughout the early part of this year. But over time, the numbers have declined, in recognition of the Pentagon's effort to put more emphasis on China and the Indo-Pacific.

But is one possible without the other? It is questionable whether this rigid approach will allow the federal government, regions, or even the revamped development institutions to address problems like health care capacity – the pandemic exposed chronic underinvestment, including in Moscow – a growing debt burden on private citizens or regional animosity towards Moscow. The crisis of Russia’s multi-level governance has been lurking behind the scenes in the past decade. The national projects, the pandemic and the return of regional politics allowed it to take centre stage. The central question of the next years is going to be whether the Kremlin is willing to give up some control in exchange for a less risky model of governance and development, or it chooses to go the other way.

The deadlines of the national projects may have been pushed back to 2030 due to the pandemic, but the so-called key performance indicators (KPIs), a set of highly quantitative measurements that the federal centre uses to evaluate the performance of regional governors, were not abolished or suspended; governors are still incentivized to prioritize spending on the projects. Regional budgets, however, suffered. Their total loss of revenue in the first eight months of the year was more than RUB500bn ($6.7bn) and unlike the federal budget most of them cannot rely on budgetary reserves, either. Regions across the board benefited from increasing revenues in 2018 but the reserves accumulated from these have been exhausted, while their financial obligations only grew.

Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat involved in the talks, said negotiators "have a lot of work to do and just a few days to do it."
 "This is our last chance before Christmas and the end of the year to bring relief to families across America in the midst of a public health crisis," Durbin said on ABC News. "We've got a few remaining issues. I think we can work them out."
 House and Senate negotiators said there is a sense of urgency to get something passed. "There is absolutely no option for failure on this," Democratic Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, part of the Problem Solvers Caucus in the House, said on "Fox on the Hill."
 "We don't have a choice now, it's one of those things that has to be done," Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
 A final version of the proposed legislation could come early this week, Cassidy said.
 A key sticking point is whether to provide liability protection to businesses whose workers fall ill to the coronavirus. Critics have said some companies, like meatpacking plants, shouldn't be protected if there are indications they didn't take adequate precautions. Cassidy said small companies could be driven out of business just from the cost of the gathering and exchanging evidence.
 "There has to be some liability protection," Cassidy said, citing what he described as ambiguity about the need for mask-wearing from health experts early in the pandemic.
 He said the bill extends unemployment benefits and lengthens a moratorium on evictions with aid given to landlords, but there's no plan to include another $1,200 stimulus check to help the economy.
 "This is not a stimulus bill but a relief bill," Cassidy said. "There may be a stimulus check, but that would be part of a different piece of legislation."
 Durbin said the last round of $1,200 checks cost $300 billion, so it couldn't be included when the mandate was to limit the total proposal to $900 billion.
 "The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn't get anything through the Republicans except this $900 billion level," Durbin said.
 Warner said neither side will "get the full amount or all the component parts that they wanted," but with the high number of virus cases and the end of aid from the earlier stimulus, it would be "stupidity on steroids if Congress doesn't act."
 While President-elect Joe Biden has said another round of stimulus will be needed in the New Year, Cassidy said that will depend on the vaccine and whether it's changing the trajectory of the pandemic. Durbin said once vaccines are being administered, Congress will have a "much better view of where we're going with this national pandemic."
 "If the vaccine is being deployed and infection rates are falling, stores are reopening, small businesses are flourishing, we don't" need another spending bill, Cassidy said. "But if the infection rate continues to climb, we may."

WVU took the opening kickoff and moved into Iowa State territory, faced a fourth down and decided to go for it, only to have Leddie Brown move before the snap, forcing a punt.
 Bad habits do return, and penalties were a bad habit the Mountaineers had early in the year, as were dropped passes, and both came back to render the offense impotent.
 “Dropped passes hurt us,” Brown admitted. “It took away some scoring opportunities, but it didn’t cost us the game.”
 Iowa State showed WVU how to do things, deciding themselves to go for it on fourth down in Mountaineer territory, with Purdy completing a pass to tight end Chase Allen, one of many big receivers who tormented the smaller WVU defensive backs all day.
 One play later, Hall broke loose on a 23-yard sprint to the end zone and it was 7-0.
 “Until we make routine plays, we will never be as good as we want to be,” Neal Brown said. “Look at Iowa State. How many extraordinary plays did they make? A couple. But what they do is make the routine plays.”
 WVU had a block in the back penalty on the ensuing kickoff, was forced to punt and Iowa State took over at the Mountaineer 44.
 A thousand-yard field wouldn’t have been long enough to keep Iowa State out of the end zone.
 The Cyclones ate up the ground on that possession, and Purdy took care of the last 10 yards with a nifty run to the end zone.
 Purdy just kept pouring it on before halftime. He completed a great back shoulder pass on third and eight for a first down and then ran for a touchdown that was waved off by a holding call.
 No sweat. They just gave the ball to Hall, who ran for another apparent touchdown, only that was called back by a face mask call on the tight end, with the ball going back to the 25.
 Not even the officials waving off two touchdowns in two plays could stop Iowa State as Purdy connected on a 20-yard pass and then, with the ball at the two, rolled and threw a 2-yard TD pass to a wide-open Landen Akers for a 21-0 halftime lead.
 “The first half was by far the worst we’ve played this far,” Neal Brown admitted.
 Nothing changed in the second half, with Purdy and Hall dominating, and the defense was all over Doege, with the game getting more lopsided with each ISU score.
 Finally, it was over.
 As West Virginia’s players gathered in the locker room, aware that they had been pushed around, the message was a simple one with Oklahoma looking them in the face.
 “The message was we have to finish the season,” said defensive end Jeffery Pooler. “We can’t give up. We’re not quitters.
 “We have to finish the season. Can’t go backwards, can’t give up. We’re not quitters.”

Bridgeport Director of Athletics Mark Jones spoke incredibly highly of Cole for his ability to develop young men on and off of the gridiron.
 “Coach Cole has been with the program for a number of years,” explained Jones. “He’s very knowledgeable, he’s a man of the community, he’s a man within the school and he symbolizes what a head coach and a mentor should be. He does teach the game but he also teaches the kids to be young men as well.”
 Cole credited the hard work of his players for the program’s sustained success during his tenure.
 “Bridgeport is a good place to coach,” he said. “We have good kids and they played hard. That was the main thing, we don’t win anything without their work ethic. They practiced hard and ultimately played hard and that’s one of the most gratifying things as a coach: watching them get better, work hard and make that hard work pay off.”
 While Cole is stepping down as the head coach, he did leave the door cracked on a possible return in some capacity to the Indian football program down the line.
 “We’ll see,” said Cole. “It depends on who the administration picks for the new head coach. I still love the program, I might be able to help out for another couple of years as a volunteer or something like that but who knows? We’ll see whenever the new head coach is picked.”

Saturday’s performance against Iowa State was another of those poor run game performances, as WVU managed to rush for just 54 yards.
 And not surprising, struggles on the ground led to problems on the scoreboard, as the Cyclones thrashed the Mountaineers, 42-6.
 “We were soundly beat in every phase. The first half was by far the worst football we’ve played to this point,” said WVU head coach Neal Brown, whose club trailed 21-0 at halftime and had only 13 rushing yards and 88 passing yards at that point. “Saying I’m extremely disappointed would put it mildly.
 “(The Cyclones) are really good, so I don’t want to say anything that will discredit them. They are playing their best football of the year. They played very well last week (in a 23-20 victory at Texas) and carried that over today.
 “I thought they were the more physical team, the more disciplined team,” continued Brown, whose WVU squad is now 5-4. “I thought they dominated on both lines of scrimmage, and it wasn’t even close.”
 West Virginia junior Leddie Brown came to Jake Trice Stadium averaging 112.1 rushing yards per game, which was the second-best mark in the Big 12, trailing only Iowa State’s Breece Hall (140.0 ypg).
 After gaining over 100 yards in five of WVU’s first eight games this season, Brown managed just 48 rushing yards against the Cyclones. Only in a 47-yard performance at Texas has he had fewer this season.
 “I have the most confidence in the world in our offensive line and our backfield,” said West Virginia senior center Chase Behrndt. “It’s just one of those things. Some days we have it, and some days we don’t.
 “Honestly, we may have just been outplayed,” added Behrndt. “They’re not ranked No. 9 for no reason. They game-planned us well. We just couldn’t find a way.”
 A lot of Leddie’s inefficiency came because his offensive line struggled with the ISU defensive front.
 “We couldn’t sustain at all,” sighed Neal Brown. “The line of scrimmage moved back most every single time. We had one drive were Leddie hit some good runs, but I think that was against (ISU’s second-team defense).
 “They dominated the line of scrimmage,” said West Virginia’s second-year head coach of Iowa State. “Early on, they shot the gaps, which they haven’t done all year. We were trying to double-team the down guys, because we knew it was going to be difficult for us to maintain one-on-one blocks.
 “They got heavy in the B gaps (between the guards and tackle), and we struggled at tackle, to put it mildly.”
 Both Behrndt and his coach certainly were disappointed in the blowout loss to Iowa State (8-2), which clinched its first-ever Big 12 regular season title with its win on Saturday.
 “We have to move on and learn from it,” stated Behrdnt. “We don’t want to feel this feeling again: it’s not a good one.”

The last hurrah of outdoor dining in Pasadena arrived on Friday evening.
 Diners seeking what would likely be their last on-site meal of 2020 filled restaurant and bar patios along Colorado Boulevard, with lines forming outside many businesses. Some, such as the modern French bistro Perle, became so busy that staff members began asking customers to give up their tables after 90 minutes in order to seat waiting guests.
 But by Sunday evening, however, those crowds had mostly vanished.
 Though it had been the last remaining holdout of outdoor dining in L.A. County, Pasadena implemented a ban on on-site dining in compliance with a state health order that took effect late Sunday night.

“Going into FBS play it was just to come out and compete,” he said of his thoughts on moving to WVU. “I put the onus on myself to be confident in my play. That’s where my mind was. There’s a difference in the game speed and the margin of error is a lot different. You could make up for a mistake (in FCS) with athleticism, where at this level, everybody is as athletic as you, if not more so. But it’s still just football.”
 That may be the case, but it’s still a big leap. More often than not, those making that move wind up as special teamers or role players – valuable cogs, for sure, but not anchors. Addae is one of the few who has actually exceeded his performance at the lower level. He had 25 tackles and six pass breakups in his final season at New Hampshire but has surpassed that showing by a significant margin at WVU.
 Originally slotted as a potential cornerback, Addae moved to a swing role and then the starting safety spot this year. Solidly built, but not huge at 5-foot-11 and 190 pounds, he relies on technique to meet the demands of the back end defender in the Mountaineer defense.
 “You have to attack the ball when it’s in the air,” the fifth-year senior said of playing against bigger foes, such as Iowa State’s massive tight ends, who he competed against this past week. “With bigger guys, if they are able to locate the ball and go up without challenging them for it, it’s difficult. You have to be aggressive. You have to be technically sound, and use your tools to your advantage.”
 With a pair of redshirt seasons – one at West Virginia, one at New Hampshire – on his resumé, it appeared as if Addae would only see three seasons of game competition on the field.
 However, the NCAA decision to not count the 2020 season as a year of eligibility has given him, along with everyone else, the chance to return in 2021 should he choose to do so. Like most every other WVU athlete, he’s not sharing any thoughts on his decision just yet.
 “In the bye week, Coach (Neal) Brown spoke to the seniors about it,” said Addae, who is tied with fellow safety Sean Mahone in special teams tackles with seven. “He also told us to focus on the ‘now.’ We still have games left in the season.”
 Addae has had no problem in doing just that, becoming one of the many hidden bedrock pieces of a defense that has provided the basis for a much-improved 2020 season.
 “We pride ourselves on getting 11 hats on the ball,” he said – a mantra that isn’t just a goal, but has been quite illustrative of the Mountaineers’ play this year.

“If you look at the bigger teams in our league, in those losses, Texas and Iowa State and Oklahoma State were able to rush the football,” Brown pointed out. “All of them had in common that we had difficulty getting off blocks. I don’t think we played with the same aggression or the same pad level or the same technique.”
 Again, the difference was glaring. In its five wins, WVU held opposing rushers to an average of only 67.8 yards per outing, and only TCU (134 yards) got into triple digits. In the losses, the number ballooned to 199.5.
 Some of that may be due to the size and ability of those opposing offensive lines, and the overall talent of the opposition. But there were some instances in the Iowa State game where effort was involved. After missing on two excellent scoring chances in the third quarter against the Cyclones, Mountaineer heads dropped, with the result that Iowa State gained 151 yards on its next nine snaps and scored twice to increase the lead to an insurmountable 35-0.
 “We were physically overpowered on Saturday,” Brown stated bluntly. “We didn’t establish an edge to our defense. That has been one of the major reasons behind our success. We didn’t box everything in on the outside and force it back to the middle. They hit a lot of runs on the edge. The d-line didn’t play to the standard they had established, and we didn’t do a good job setting edges at spear or will linebacker or cornerback and turning plays back into the inside. It was a cumulative effect, and we didn’t play well enough to beat a quality team on any level of our defense.”
 Oklahoma will challenge West Virginia’s home record this year with an excellent offense, even though the attack was somewhat blunted by Baylor. The Bears held the Sooners to 269 yards of total offense and a 5-13 mark on third down conversions, though OU did prevail, 27-14.
 “I think Oklahoma not playing in a couple of weeks probably had something to do with that, and Baylor did some really good things schematically,” Brown analyzed. “Those guys running [the Bears’ defense] there have had their hands on some elite defenses. Their nickel (Jalen) Pitre, I think he’s special.”
 West Virginia, with its own nickel-base defensive system, could try to take a few items from Baylor’s play, employing standout spear Tykee Smith in a similar manner. However, it will take more than schemes to topple the Sooners.
 “They scored 27 points and still won the game handily,” Brown said. “On offense, they still look pretty sporty.”

The retreat in some places and the push forward in others are happening as the virus comes back with a vengeance across much of the U.S., with deaths per day averaging over 2,200 — about the same level seen during the very deadliest stretch of the outbreak, last spring in the New York City area.
 Newly cases are averaging close to 200,000 a day, the highest level on record, and the number of Americans now in the hospital has reached all-time highs at over 100,000.
 The virus is blamed for more than 280,000 deaths and over 14.8 million confirmed infections in the U.S, with the crisis widely expected to worsen in the coming weeks because of Americans' disregard of warnings to stay home and avoid others over Thanksgiving.
 Health officials say the virus does not appear to be spreading rapidly in classrooms themselves, perhaps because children may be less likely to spread or contract the virus. Instead, many cases among youngsters and educators have been traced to activities outside school.
 Still, the infections have alarmed parents and educators, and the illnesses and quarantines among teachers and other employees have left some schools short of adult supervision.
 At the same time, parents and others have complained that children are not getting a good education at home in front of a computer. And the switch to remote learning has caused hardship for many families by forcing parents to watch over their children instead of going to work.
 In South Carolina, where COVID-19 cases have spiked to levels higher than those seen when the state was one of the nation's hot spots over the summer, school districts are considering cutting back on how much time students spend in the classroom. More than 2,450 new COVID-19 cases have been reported in South Carolina in each of the past three days.
 A teacher group there is asking districts to go back to all-virtual teaching until the spike can be flattened, citing not just health concerns but a shortage of adults to keep students safe.

You know, this was a somber day for Virginia, but it was a necessary day. And what a tragic loss of Breonna Taylor. And her family was with us today in Virginia, and just had a -- I had the opportunity to sit and really hear their story.
 As you mentioned, we're the third state had to have a no-knock warrant law. We're actually the first state to sign into law in response to her death. So, this is important. It's time that we as a society do more than just talk about these tragedies. And it's time to take action.
 And that's what we chose to do. I called the General Assembly back into special session in September. And they took up a lot of measures with police reform, such as decertification, co-responding when there's mental illness, better training for police officers.
 And, as I made the point today, this is not about being anti-police. It's about being pro-people. We need to make sure that we treat people civilly across our commonwealth. And so, today, to be able to sign Breonna's Law into law was a -- it's just a -- was a good step for the Commonwealth of Virginia.
 And I would hope that other states follow suit.
