For one more season, the student section at West Henderson High School will get to do one of its favorite chants at volleyball matches: "USA ... USA ... USA ... America," which is for senior America Anderson.


   


  Maybe at her next stop of her volleyball journey, those fans will do the same.


   


  Anderson announced Sunday that she has officially committed to UNC Greensboro.


   


  "I'm so excited about playing Division-I volleyball at UNCg in the fall of 2021," she said on Sunday. "I couldn't be more fortunate to continue my career at such an amazing university with an outstanding volleyball program."


   


  The 5-11 middle blocker was a key member of a team loaded with talent last year. The Falcons finished 30-7 and made it all the way to the 3-A state finals, where they fell in four sets to Chapel Hill.


   


  For Anderson, she said it's a dream come true to get to continue to play the sports she loves after high school.


   


  "Volleyball is such a big part of my life, and I couldn't imagine not playing. I want to thank all my coaches, teammates, friends and family for helping me make my dreams come true," she said. "I can't wait to get back on the court at WHHS for my senior season. The best is yet to come."


   


  With Anderson's announcement, veteran West coach Tiffany Lowrance will have two Division-I commitments on her squad this year, the other being Malia Moore, who is heading to Alabama. Lowrance said Sunday that UNC Greensboro is getting a gem in Anderson.


   


  "America's wingspan is huge, and she is going to be a great asset at the net for UNCG," Lowrance said.


   


  Anderson's defense was key to the Falcons' long run in the playoffs last season. She finished second on the team in blocks with 77 and also finished with 21 digs.


   


  She was also on a force at the net offensively, finishing fourth on the team in kills with 185, while also adding 86 serving points.


   


  Lowrance said there's a lot more to Anderson than just her play on the court.


   


  "What's even better is that (UNC Greensboro) is getting a great teammate and very coachable kid. She has a bright future ahead of her," Lowrance said.


   


  West is hoping for another long run in the playoffs this season. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the North Carolina High School Athletic Association has changed the fall sports calendar, with just volleyball and cross country starting this year. For both sports, the first practice is set for Nov. 4 with the first official events set for Nov. 16.


   


  The regular season is also cut to just 10 matches, which is a drastic reduction from last year when West ended up playing 37.

First, a note about the title. Why all the extra words? Why isn't it just called "David Copperfield?" You should be grateful. The Charles Dickens novel, published serially beginning in 1849, was known as "The Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger of Blunderstone Rookery (Which He Never Meant to be Published on Any Account)."      Second, an explanation of my relationship with "David Copperfield." I've never read it (isn't it something like 900-pages long?) and, until now, I'd never seen any feature film or made-for-TV movie based on it. So, there'll be no comparisons of the work by Mr. Dickens to the screenplay by Simon Blackwell or the direction by Armando Iannucci.      It's quite obvious that cuts have been made, that scenes and (I've been told) even characters have been eliminated, in that the film comes in at a comparatively compact two-hour running time. But to the questions: Is it a good story and is it well told?, the answers to both are a resounding yes.      I did check out the Project Gutenberg Ebook of "David Copperfield" and can attest to the fact that the first line of both the novel and the film is "Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show."      I'll only know of other similarities if I one day sit down to read the book. For now, here's what you've got in store in this wonderfully entertaining film.      It's jam-packed with characters, and I use that word in an imaginative, expressive manner. Our titular protagonist, played with compassion and energetic zest by Dev Patel, is one of the film's few "normal" people, and is joined in that category by possible love interest Agnes (a glowing Rosalind Eleazar). Pretty much everyone else around David goes over the top in displaying some sort of odd personality, whether it be pushy Betsey Trotwood (Tilda Swinton), evil Murdstone (Darren Boyd), rascally Mr. Micawber (Peter Capaldi - "Dr. Who" fans rejoice!), slimy Uriah Heep (Ben Wishaw), addled Mr. Dick (Hugh Laurie), or bubbleheaded Dora Spenlow (Morfydd Clark).      The story - the autobiography, really - is told from the point of view of David, looking back on the freewheeling, troubled, rewarding, ultimately happy life he's been living. He's introduced as a storyteller in the opening frames, and that's no surprise, as he's seen, throughout the film, jotting down notes on scraps of paper - whether they be his own thoughts or words that others have said.      So, we learn of his widowed mother marrying the awful man Murdstone, and Murdstone's dastardly plan to send young David off to the city to work in a dreadful bottling factory. And we find out early on that no matter what misfortunes the young lad - and later the young man - faces, he is a kind and generous soul who just wants to help others.      No matter how bad things get for David, and a few other individuals, one of the reasons that Dickens' book has been and this film should be so popular is that it also boasts a terrific sense of humor, which is put across here with dialogue, line delivery, body movements, and even a bit of slapstick.      Changes in David's life come flying at him with regularity. After too much emotional abuse at the bottle factory, he runs off to live with demanding Aunt Betsey, who appears to be the guardian of poor, mixed up Mr. Dick, both of whom turn out to be kindly. Then David heads off to school, where he meets up with enigmatic fellow student Steerforth (Aneurin Barnard), one of many people from whom David feels a need to hide what he considers his lowly family background. Then there's the accountant Wickfield (Benedict Wong) and his lovely daughter Agnes and, best of all, hiding from every debt-collector in town, the colorful Mr. Micawber.      So many people, so much storytelling, such a winning performance by Patel of a character I'd like to know even better. Perhaps it's time for me to read the book.      "The Personal History of David Copperfield" opens theatrically on Aug. 28. Please check the Website of your local cinema for safety guidelines during the pandemic.

 Late last week, The Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee confirmed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the official Democratic presidential ticket and, in doing so, ratified the official party issue platform.  The first official 80 page public draft of the Party's platform was released last month, which predictably included a short but informative two paragraphs about the Party and Biden's unprecedented gun control platform.
 Some of the measures detailed in their plan include criminalizing private firearm transfers, instituting endless "delay" windows for background checks, banning the manufacture and sale of modern sporting rifles, enacting licensing schemes to restrict Second Amendment rights, mandating home storage requirements under penalty of law, and repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act to expose the industry to a deluge of baseless lawsuits intended to bankrupt gun companies.
 This anti-Second Amendment platform, however, comes as no surprise to anyone who has been paying attention to the disdain with which Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both treat American gun owners. Last March, Detroit Union autoworker Jerry Wayne elicited shock from both Democrats and Republicans when he questioned Joe Biden on his Second Amendment views and was met with a flurry of insults from the former Vice President, who told Wayne "not to be such a horse's ass," and that he is "full of sh*t."
 Biden's personal ignorance of the American firearm landscape runs deeper still. Biden has been a longtime advocate for the universally failed science behind "DNA-enabled smart guns." Moreover, Biden has been an unabashed proponent of gun confiscation. When asked about "forced buybacks" by Anderson Cooper, Biden said "Bingo… You're right, if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is they should be illegal, period." He has even said that he would appoint failed Presidential and Senate candidate Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke as a gun control czar after the former Congressman said "Hell yes" when asked if he wants to confiscate legally owned modern sporting rifles such as the AR-15.
 Biden's new running mate, Kamala Harris, isn't any better on gun rights. Not only does she also enthusiastically support all of the DNC's gun control measures, she is also perfectly content to violate the Constitution to ensure they are put into effect. During the Democratic Primary debates, Harris laughed at the idea that a U.S. President cannot subvert Congress and take executive action on firearms. When asked if she would support such unilateral action, she continued to laugh and say "yes, we can."
 The convention this week, however, was the inflection point at which Biden's radical gun control agenda became the official position of the Democratic Party. The DNC's preference to rhetoric over fact is put on display, for example, by the anti-gunners desire to close the "Charleston Loophole" by eliminating the timeframe in which the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) must complete a check for a gun sale.  The reality, however, is that 91 percent of all background checks are completed instantly and of the 9 percent that are delayed, 94 percent of those are completed within 10 days. The anti-Second Amendment activists inside the DNC know this but are using their hollow political rhetoric to push legislation that would create an avenue through which the government could arbitrarily deny firearm purchases at will by indefinitely delaying background checks. We know this because instead of following the current law, U.S. Senators tried to shut it down during the busiest firearm-buying period on record earlier this year.
 Biden, Harris, and the DNC are still doubling down on modern sporting rifle bans even though evidence shows such a ban would have no meaningful impact on crime reduction, per evidence from the Center for Disease Control. Voters in 18 U.S. swing states also do not support such a ban as overwhelmingly as the Democratic Party would have you believe.  Of those polled in those states, more than half responded they wouldn't support a ban on modern sporting rifles and want politicians to respect individual rights and enforce laws presently on the books.
 As the RNC convention starts this week, last week's Democratic convention only confirmed what so many of us already knew; that the DNC is listening more to their radical base than to everyday Americans. Simply put, this is an agenda that is so far out of step with normal Americans that it is tripping over itself.

The nonprofit community-based group MCC L.I.T., which stands for Mary C. Canty Lifelong Impacted Teens, built Kimberly’s mother a wheelchair ramp two weeks ago.
 Hickman said she and her daughter are paying out of pocket to try to make her mother’s home more wheelchair-accessible inside, too.
 MCC L.I.T. came about a little over three years ago, when Ja’Net Wade heard about the death of three teenagers within a six-month timeframe in Myrtle Beach.
 “The three teen deaths spoke volumes to me,” Wade said. “It stated there was a definite cry for help.”
 Wade, the recreation youth coordinator for the City of Myrtle Beach, went on to create MCC L.I.T., based out of the Mary C. Canty Recreation Center on Canal Street in Myrtle Beach.
 “I wanted to create [the program] to provide a platform for teens led by teens to be able to address these needs and issues that teens are experiencing in our communities, while also providing leadership opportunities and a community outreach of resources for the teens, their families and peers,” Wade said.
 The group is made up of teens, 13 to 17-years-old.
 Mia Angelo, a college student mentor to the group, said the students also serve as a teen advisory board for the Myrtle Beach City Council.
 Angelo said Wade is like an “Auntie” to the students. Their parents call on her for help, and she also makes house visits.
 Angelo hopes to be trainedsoon to do similar things for the group.
 “These kids are just awesome,” Angelo said. “I feel like they have taught me more than I’ve ever been able to teach them. They always have a great attitude…can easily put a smile on your face. Every one of them is different and unique and brings something different to the table.”
 Before COVID-19 restrictions, the group was able to meet three or four times a week. After school, Angelo and Wade at times had meals for them at the center, and set up discussions to talk about different issues.
 “Last time we met we were talking about police brutality. We want to talk to them about some of the serious stuff, but we also talk about things like important skills you need going into an interview, and also just about what might be going on in their home,” Angelo said.
 Before the virus, Angelo said they also took incentive trips to nearby towns if someone made a milestone grade on schoolwork, got a new job or had another accomplishment to celebrate.
 Angelo said a large part of the group is made up of Black students, and in the past sometimes those incentive trips included travel to historically Black colleges and universities to teach them about the college application process and expose them to college settings.

Perhaps it’s been a culmination of things: a coronavirus crisis that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans in the past few months, and a president—whose racist and inflammatory language, and inability to acknowledge science—has put every last American in danger. Or perhaps, it’s the time being isolated and bored, coupled with the incessant ability to be on social media that allows you to absorb and internalize every last ounce of news and injustice. But Floyd’s death has unleashed Black people’s collective rage that has been pent up for centuries. For the first time, white America, whether it’s performative allyship or a genuine reawakening, can no longer ignore the blaze around them—not on our watch, not today.
