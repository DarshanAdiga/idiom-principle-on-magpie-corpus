Jordan Henderson insists Liverpool will attack Manchester United in the second leg of their Europa League tie, highlighting his team's momentum as crucial. A Daniel Sturridge penalty and Roberto Firmino goal saw Jurgen Klopp's men to a 2-0 victory over United in the first leg of the last-16 clash at Anfield on Thursday. The win was Liverpool's fourth in their past five games and Henderson said he finally felt his team were on a roll. \"You can see the confidence in the team,\" the…

Are analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.

West Brom checked Leicester City's Premier League title bid as Craig Gardner's superb second-half free-kick earned a 2-2 draw at the King Power Stadium.
 Claudio Ranieri's men edge three points ahead of Tottenham, who will move to the summit on goal difference if they win at West Ham on Wednesday.
 Leicester were dominant for much of the first half, but fell behind in the 11th minute when Salomon Rondon breached them for the first time in a Premier League home match since Loic Remy's consolation goal for Chelsea on December 14.
 Danny Drinkwater's deflected effort meant City became the first top-flight side to bring up 50 league goals this season and the superb Riyad Mahrez set up Andy King – in for the injured and influential N'Golo Kante in midfield – with an exquisite touch to score on the stroke of the interval.
 Mahrez erred with a handball that Gardner emphatically punished and Leicester could not replicate the last-gasp weekend winner Leonardo Ulloa netted against Norwich City despite a flurry of late pressure.
 King fired over when West Brom failed to clear a 10th-minute set-piece, but the visitors broke the deadlock less than 60 seconds later.
 Rondon scampered beyond Robert Huth to latch on to Darren Fletcher's pass and slid a shot through Kasper Schmeichel's legs in composed fashion.
 The two attacking stars of Leicester's title bid both strived to find an equaliser - Mahrez dancing through a succession of challenges until West Brom's massed ranks scrambled back to block, before he centred for Jamie Vardy to head into Ben Foster's arms.
 Leicester's response arrived from a more unlikely source in the 30th minute when Drinkwater speculatively took aim from 30 yards and his strike spun off Jonas Olsson and into the top corner.
 Following his second goal of the campaign, Drinkwater turned provider and Vardy headed his chipped left-wing cross against the crossbar.
 The second goal Leicester's first-half dominance deserved came in stoppage time when Mahrez had the presence of mind to direct a stunning backheel flick from Marc Albrighton's cross-field ball into King's path for a clinical first- time finish.
 Five minutes into the second period, West Brom were level through a goal of comparable quality – Gardner launching a curling and dipping 25-yard free-kick over the Leicester wall that left Schmeichel with no chance.
 In the 56th minute, Albrighton tormented Albion right-back Craig Dawson to clip in wonderful cross that Shinji Okazaki crashed on to the crossbar.
 The irrepressible Vardy harried Gareth McAuley out of possession on the left touchline and drove in field to force Foster to save with his boot at his near post.
 The visitors retreated to their own area as time ticked down - Wes Morgan thudded a shot into Foster from close range and, on the last attack, Ulloa missed his kick and the chance to be Leicester's saviour all over again,
 West Brom are 13th, 12 points better off than third-bottom Norwich, and remaining trips to Arsenal, Manchester City and Tottenham might allow Tony Pulis to have a further say in the title race.

"articleBody" : "Isabel Jiménez conectaba este lunes en directo con el hospital temporal de IFEMA para conocer el funcionamiento de un termómetro instalado en la entrada capaz de medir la temperatura de tres personas por segundo a una distancia de tres metros. Un reportero de 'Informativos Telecinco' era el encargado de explicar al espectador el sistema de análisis sin esperar el sorprendente diagnóstico que obtendría y que, en realidad, tiene una sencilla explicación.Lorenzo Díaz se situaba frente al detector y, en pleno directo, mostraba la silueta del reportero en rojo e indicaba que sufría una fiebre de 38 grados. "Están saltando porque llevamos ya varias pruebas y nos hemos puesto un poco nerviosos", trataba de salir al paso. Restaba así importancia a lo que parecía un problema de salud o un fallo en el termómetro, sobre el cual aseguraba que varias empresas se están interesando para asegurar el bienestar de sus trabajadores.El reportero Lorenzo Díaz marca 38º de fiebre en directoEl informativo continuaba con normalidad. Si bien el termómetro, instalado por la empresa china Dahua Iberia, tiene un margen de error de tres décimas, Díaz había manifestado en todo momento una temperatura de 36,5 grados durante las pruebas realizadas antes de la conexión con Isabel Jiménez.¿Qué pasó entonces?El propio reportero ha sido el encargado de explicar los motivos de este inesperado diagnóstico en directo a través de un vídeo en Nius, medio digital de Mediaset España.

India should convert the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity, accelerate infrastructure projects and win the war against the coronavirus to achieve economic growth, Union minister for road transport and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari said on Tuesday. "Indian industry should look at the current situation as a blessing in disguise and aim towards improving its export potential," Gadkari said in a discussion with members of FICCI via video conference.The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) minister also told industry officials to clear pending dues owed by them to units to ease distress in the sector and inject liquidity into the market.Ensuring liquidity in the market is key during the crisis and to ensure this, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has started settling all pending claims and arbitration, he said.The ministry has a definitive plan to clear all legitimate claims within three months, he said. "Time taken in reaching decisions should be kept at the minimum possible to avoid delays. For this purpose, I have requested all chairmen of such bodies to work till 7 pm everyday instead of 5 pm at present," he added. Referring to the importance of liquidity in markets, he said his ministry is striving to increase credit guarantee for MSMEs to Rs 5 lakh crore from Rs 1 lakh crore at present, wherein 75% of advances granted by financial institutions are under the government's credit guarantee scheme. MSMEs contribute 29% of the country's GDP, Gadkari noted. "The government's endeavour was to protect MSMEs from the coronavirus-induced crisis. We have decided to raise (turnover) limits for MSMEs. I would like to request you, major industries also have huge outstanding dues of MSMEs," he said."We were earlier considering framing a law entailing stringent rules regarding such payments. However, now is not the right time for this. We do not wish to go down that road. An order to this effect should hopefully be out in eight to 10 days, which will naturally enhance their coverage," he added. Gadkari informed the industry that RBI has allowed rescheduling of term loans and working capital facilities. He called on the industry sector to work in tandem with the government and banking sector. Construction of highways, which witnessed record growth during 2019-20, should increase pace by two to three times in the coming years to meet growing needs for infrastructure, Gadkari said. The ministry plans to go ahead with critical projects during the lockdown."We have spoken to the Uttarakhand government for starting work on the Char Dham Expressway National Highway project. Necessary precautions of social distancing etc will be taken for the construction," he said. To kick-start recovery for the road sector, the ministry is open to re-starting projects at different locations on the condition that adequate measures are put in place to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, he added.

"It's so sad, we lost him in a few days," Malcolm told BBC Radio 5 Live.
 "It's so difficult when a loved one is admitted to hospital and you are told you can't visit, you can't be there for them.
 "Later on when I got the call to say he had passed, it was a very, very weird feeling."
 Malcolm said he last saw his father about a month before his death when he was in "good fettle" and had not visited since because he was adhering to social distancing measures designed to shield the most vulnerable from the virus.
 "Until you get the death certificate and the reality sinks in, it feels like you're having a dream and you'll be out of it in a minute," added the 57-year- old.
 "I'm trying to come to terms with it but it's going to be really difficult."
 Malcolm said his father had been responding well to antibiotics to treat the bladder infection but was tested for coronavirus after starting to develop some breathing problems.
 "It's surreal - you're told he's responding well so you think everything is all right, then next you hear you're told to prepare for the worst and then 20 minutes later, he's gone," he said.
 "We have a date for the funeral but the process is so different now to going through a bereavement in the past," added Malcolm, whose mother died when he was five.
 "There are only five people plus the vicar allowed at the graveside.
 "We're hoping in the future when we get back to some normality, we can possibly do a proper service, celebrating his life with all his grandkids and his friends."

But the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a "wisdom of crowds" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes — much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close. And so with CTL trading so far below that average target price of $11.71/share, the 15.93% upside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bearish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and downward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bullish and upgrade? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good "signal" to investors in CTL to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for CenturyLink Inc.

As the COVID-19 pandemic started to spread, Tim Hortons reviewed its advertising plans and decided they no longer made sense as store closures, wide-scale layoffs and physical distancing upended life in Canada.
 Instead, the coffee chain went back to the drawing board for two new ads. One informs customers how to buy doughnuts, double doubles and other products without going inside a restaurant, while the other follows Tim Hortons trucks delivering free coffee and doughnuts to essential workers.
 "When we looked at what media we had committed to, we said: 'There's a better way,'" said Hope Bagozzi, chief marketing officer at Restaurant Brands International, the parent company for Tim Hortons.
 Corporate spots acknowledging the pandemic have proliferated on TV breaks in recent weeks as companies grapple with how to fill previously purchased ad slots and what, if anything, they want to to say. How they proceed varies from brand to brand, but no one wants to risk appearing tone deaf during a national crisis.
 "A lot of advertising — whether we want to admit it or not — is built on what has worked in the past," said James Ansley, executive creative director at Grey Canada.
 "It feels like right now, the rule book has been completely thrown out and we're all trying to find our way through this."
 In the early days of the pandemic, Ansley saw companies do things that "felt a little bit ... lacking in meaning," such as spacing out their logos in a nod to physical distancing. McDonald's Brazil, for example, separated its golden arches mid-March, but later reversed the decision after facing criticism.
 Companies are now trying to do something meaningful, said Ansley, by trying to help people feel safe and secure.
 Utilitarian ads are one such attempt.
 Tim Hortons released one in late March with an employee explaining drive-thrus are open and that app and delivery partners are accepting orders.
 That ad was designed as "an accessibility spot" to answer questions the company was receiving from customers, said Bagozzi.
 It's notable that such ads aren't geared toward selling products.
 Ford Canada, for instance, created an ad thanking workers, and closing with information on how customers leasing or financing vehicles through its credit program could receive help.
 BMO ran an ad thanking "all the front-liners for keeping our lives moving" without mentioning any banking services. A&W created an ad with a similar message of gratitude to its restaurant staff, essential workers and everyday Canadians "staying home to help stop the spread" that doesn't show anything more than the fast-food chain's spokesman, presumably in his own home, with a partial logo visible on the wall behind him.
 The company wanted the gratitude to be authentic, genuine and dominant, said CEO Susan Senecal.
 "That's how we felt at that moment in time and we just wanted to express that completely," she said. "We didn't think anything more was necessary."
 A&W scrapped its original plans in this "very unusual set of circumstances," Senecal said, and decided a message of thanks worked better.
 The brands Ansley works with have "taken the foot off the pedal as far as pushing product," which he thinks is the right move as staggering numbers of people apply for emergency government assistance.

Jordan Henderson insists Liverpool will attack Manchester United in the second leg of their Europa League tie, highlighting his team's momentum as crucial.
 A Daniel Sturridge penalty and Roberto Firmino goal saw Jurgen Klopp's men to a 2-0 victory over United in the first leg of the last-16 clash at Anfield on Thursday.
 The win was Liverpool's fourth in their past five games and Henderson said he finally felt his team were on a roll.
 "You can see the confidence in the team," the captain said.
 "We're performing well and we've had some good results of late. That's given everyone a boost.
 "We started the game really well and kept it going. We finished very strongly. We’ll take a lot of confidence from that.
 "Momentum is a big thing in football and it feels like we've finally got that now."
 Despite holding a two-goal lead heading into the return leg at Old Trafford, Henderson insisted Liverpool would attack their rivals.
 The 25-year-old called for a repeat performance from his team, who if not for David de Gea could hold an even bigger lead.
 "It will be difficult at Old Trafford. I'm sure United will be looking to respond," Henderson said.
 "They will be right up for it and they will have nothing to lose. That makes them dangerous so we need to ensure we do things properly and get a good result there.
 "We have to go there looking to win the game on the night. We have to approach it like it's 0-0. We just have to focus on reaching the levels we did in the first leg."
