A brief visit inside the attraction showed off the two-sided ride vehicles that will transport riders through the attraction. Riders will use hand gestures tracked by hidden motion-tracking technology to sling webs like Spider-Man at rambunctious spider-bots that have run amok throughout Avengers Campus. Technicians were testing the ride vehicles during the visit.

The new attraction will be housed inside a former Stark Industries automobile assembly plant that has been transformed into the Web Slingers dark ride. The media tour included a visit to the attraction’s pre-show room where Spider-Man will invite riders to test drive the new Web Slinger vehicles. The pre-show includes a tech demonstration by Spider-Man that goes awry when the spider- bots get stuck in a replication loop. As you might expect, mayhem ensues as the spider-bots continue to multiply throughout the duration of the ride.

James then motioned his arms to indicate a small circle around him.
 “Like right here in my bubble,” James said. “Very challenging to do an interview like this.”
 What was clear during his news conference was that James isn’t concerned about his own health. But in the four days since he said he would not play in a game that didn’t include fans, James has revised his stance, saying he will do so if it’s in the best interest of the franchise and the league.
 “It’s funny, because when I was asked the question of would you play without … fans, I had no idea that there was actually a conversation going on behind closed doors about the particular virus,” James said. “Obviously, I would be very disappointed not having the fans, because that is what I play for, I play for my family, I play for my fans. They say no one could actually come to the game if they decide to go to that point, so I would be disappointed in that. But at the same time, you’ve got to listen to the people that’s keeping a track on what’s going on.
 “If they feel like it’s best for the safety of the players, the safety of the franchise, the safety of the league to mandate that, then we all listen to it.”
 James said he hasn’t changed any of his personal habits because of the coronavirus.
 The team doctor spoke with players over the weekend about coronavirus safety. They were mostly told not to worry too much because their age group has not been severely affected by the virus.

KARACHI/LONDON/TEHRAN: Twelve new cases of the novel coronavirus were discovered in Pakistan between Monday and Tuesday, taking the country’s tally to 19, as the global death toll from Covid-19 reached 4,067, with more than 115,124 cases recorded from 105 countries.
 Three fresh cases were confirmed on Tuesday – two in Sindh and one in Balochistan. The development came after nine virus cases were detected in the province overnight.
 In Karachi, a major corporation shut down its seafront offices on Tuesday after an employee was diagnosed with the virus. The company said as a precautionary measure, it shut down its office for three days.
 The second individual diagnosed with coronavirus was found in Hyderabad, the Sindh health department said. “#Sindh Health Department has 2 new cases of #CoronaVirusPakistan The first case is from Hyderabad & the patient arrived from Syria via Doha. The second case is from Karachi & the patient arrived from Iran via Dubai. This brings the total number of cases to 15 in Sindh,” tweeted Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health department.
 The third case of the day surfaced in Quetta where a 12-year-old boy contracted the virus who crossed into Pakistan from Iran-Pakistan border at Taftan, media reported.
 On Monday night, Sindh’s health authorities announced that as many as nine more people, who had reached Karachi from Syria and Britain, had tested positive for Covid-19 and were being treated at three different hospitals in the city.
 Meanwhile, the interior ministry on Tuesday extended the closure of Pakistan- Afghan border at Chaman for the next seven days to adopt further preventive measures in a bid to overcome the spread of coronavirus.
 The increasing number of coronavirus cases in the country led to rumours Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches in Karachi would be cancelled. Refuting such talk, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail stated that the matches would be held in Karachi and across the country “as per schedule and the people should have no need to fear about the disturbance in its schedule”.
 However, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Peechuho said the decision on PSL matches would be made “in the next few days” and “any such decision, if required, could only be made by [Sindh] Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah — that too on recommendation of the task force constituted by him to monitor the emerging situation”.
 Since the novel coronavirus first emerged in late December 2019, more than 115,124 cases have been recorded in 105 countries and territories, killing 4,067 people, according to an AFP tally compiled on Tuesday based on official sources. More than 15,000 cases have been counted in Europe. The worst affected countries are mainland China, (80,754 cases, of which 3,136 deaths), Italy (9,172 cases, 463 deaths), South Korea (7,513 cases, 54 deaths), Iran (8,042 cases, 291 deaths) and France (1,412 cases, 25 deaths). Mongolia and northern Cyprus announced their first cases on Tuesday. Iran reported 54 new deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day toll since the start of the outbreak in the country, bringing the number of those killed by the virus to 291.
 In Britain, a total of 373 people tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, up from 319 at the same point on Monday, the Department of Health said.
 England’s deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the start of the UK peak of the coronavirus epidemic is expected within the next fortnight. She defended the government’s decision to delay closing schools and the introduction of other stringent tactics, saying experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a “balanced response”.
 But new measures — including those aimed at protecting the elderly and vulnerable — are expected shortly as cases rise more rapidly across the UK. The FCO said US authorities are planning a flight on Tuesday to repatriate British nationals on the Grand Princess cruise ship at the Port of Oakland, California.
 Health minister Jo Churchill said some patients can expect to wait longer for NHS treatment as doctors prioritise those with more serious illness and multiple underlying health conditions first. The Foreign Office confirmed it was in contact with Britons in Vietnam after reports of nine new cases confirmed among travellers on board the same flight from London to Hanoi on March 2, including seven British citizens.
 Hundreds of flights between the UK and Italy were cancelled due to the virus, leaving some passengers stranded.
 In France, where five parliamentarians have been infected, Culture Minister Franck Riester contracted the coronavirus and is staying at home.
 In Ireland, St Patrick’s Day parades scheduled on March 17 across the country have been cancelled, as is the parade in the US city of Boston. All matches in the world judo championships are cancelled until April 30.
 In Italy, 60 million of its people were ordered to “stay at home” from Tuesday in a government decree which allows travel only for the most urgent work or health reasons. The football league was suspended until April 3 and Austria banned entry for people from Italy, unless they have a doctor’s certificate. Romania and Slovenia respectively banned gatherings of more than 1,000 and 100 people. Barcelona’s Champions League round of 16 return match against Napoli on March 18 will be played behind closed doors.
 Israel imposed a two-week quarantine on all arrivals. The measure, already in force for several European countries, has so far spared countries such as the United States.
 In China, more than 70 per cent of those who have been infected have been cured since the epidemic broke out. The central Chinese province of Hubei, the epicentre of the coronavirus, eased travel restrictions on its inhabitants. China’s President Xi Jinping, on a visit to the provincial capital Wuhan, said the epidemic had been “basically curbed” there.
 In the United States, five members of Congress, including at least two Republicans who have mixed with President Donald Trump, are in voluntary confinement after being exposed to the coronavirus. Trump himself has not been tested.

The remarks came a day after the two sides agreed to review a four-year-old deal aimed at stemming refugee flows to Europe. Mevlut Cavusoglu said the EU has to take “sincere” steps to help Turkey manage the flow of migrants, including finding ways to ensure Syrian refugees can return home.
 The minister spoke a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a meeting with top EU officials in Brussels during which the sides agreed to review their 2016 deal on migrants. The meeting was called after thousands of migrants massed on Turkey’s border with Greece, following the Turkish government’s decision to open its borders to migrants wanting to cross into Europe. Greece has deployed riot police and border guards to prevent the crossings, sparking clashes between migrants and Greek security forces.
 Following the talks in Brussels late on Monday, European Council President Charles Michel said teams headed by Cavusoglu and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borell, would work “in the next days to clarify the implementation of the deal between Turkey and the EU to be certain that we are on the same page”. “We are ready for a constructive study ... We expect sincerity from the EU. The era of stringing Turkey along is over,” Cavusoglu told state-run Anadolu Agency. Cavusoglu said the sides would work toward “updating” the Turkey-EU deal in line with recent developments, including the situation in Syria’s northwestern Idlib province, where a Syrian government offensive has driven thousands of Syrians toward the border with Turkey.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden has delivered decisive wins in Missouri and Mississippi, dealing an early blow to Bernie Sanders on a night when six states were up for grabs.
 Both men were focused intensely on Michigan, Tuesday's biggest prize. That's where the Vermont senator scored an upset that lent much-needed credibility to his 2016 primary challenge of Hillary Clinton. It's also where President Donald Trump's victory four years was so narrow that Democrats are desperate to show they have the strength to flip it back.
 Beyond Michigan, Sanders could get a boost in Idaho, North Dakota or Washington state. Polls there haven't yet closed.

ISLAMABAD: Senior bureaucrat Dr Safdar Sohail Tuesday termed the long term plan of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) "stunting", as it did not result into a 'mutually constitutive' development alliance between the two sides.
 Dr Safdar Sohail, Special Secretary Cabinet Division, was first convener of the Joint Working Group on Industrial Cooperation when the CPEC was conceived and materialized into billions of dollar projects.
 He also disclosed that both sides decided to establish Industry Cooperation Fund but that was never materialized. Dr Safdar remained affiliated with the CPEC at different positions in the past. He was the lead negotiator on CPEC Long Term Plan and then served as the founding Executive Director of CPEC Center of Excellence.
 He made these bold and blunt remarks during a one-day dialogue on industrial cooperation under the CPEC and SEZs framework arranged by the Board of Investment here.
 Dr Safdar said he was using the harsh word of "stunting" for the CPEC Long Term Plan because it failed to achieve the strategic institutional thickening.
 He said corporations on both sides joined hands with the help of some political elites and a handful of bureaucrats, channelizing their investments into such ventures where the short- term benefits were personalized and long- term risks were socialized.
 Dr Safdar further said the titled CPEC LTP agreed in November 2017 did not lend itself to any kind of 'mutually constitutive' development alliance.
 "This 'aspirational plan' actually is an amalgamation of old China-Pakistan Cooperation Agreement, LTP Outline MoU and Draft Production Capacity MoU 2015, leaving Chinese and Pakistani LTP aside" he added.
 "It was a bad luck for the LTP process that the mid-level officials of NDRC coordinating the Early Harvest Program (EHP) had also taken in their hands to conclude the LTP. They were somehow averse to accepting any long-term commitments with Pakistan, he added.
 Now, he said both sides had the new terms of second phase, without clearly speaking what the first phase was and without evaluating the performance of the first phase under the CPEC.
 For way forward, he suggested that there was a need to create conditions for a reset of CPEC starting with the vision and goals, setting new priorities and new framework of a Long Term Strategic Economic Partnership between Pakistan and China.
 Without a major upgradation of governance capacity, he said the chances of optimally benefitting from the CPEC would continue to be slim. But, CPEC could not wait for an overhaul of the whole governance apparatus. Therefore, there is a need to go for a selective institutional thickening both at the federal and local level which has a demonstrated capacity of being effective, he added.
 For industrial development, he suggested enhancing governance capacity of trade and investment officers, aligning Development Policies and internal policy reform agenda with CPEC by building industrial infrastructure and upgrading Regulatory and Policy Support System e.g. early establishment of already approved Exim Bank and Land Port Authority of Pakistan, adopting a strategic Industrial Policy; choosing champions but also defending legitimate interests of the local industry, upgrading the Business Environment, reducing litigations, frauds, managing land issues, security, enhance ease of doing business, preparing for bigger inflows of Chinese aid, re-socializing Pakistani firms and policy community towards China and overcoming synergy deficit among government ministries through greater collaborative efforts.

Yes, Matthew. Thanks for the question. And indeed, we saw in Germany a decline of the interest rate, which does impact obviously the accrual but not at all the cash flow, which we have to spend on pension. And we still have a rather high sensitivity to the pension accrual. So give and take 100 basis points changes, does mean a change in the accrual of €250 million to €300 million. We are now today at 1.3%, which is like a very low in historic terms. With regards to, how do we see pensions, with regards to our debt, basically the answer is we see it like the rating agencies because at the end of the day we – and you know that, strive for being an investment-grade rated company and the pension are regarded as debt, but what do the rating agencies do. They not only take the pension accrual as a whole, they have a look as well at the cash flow impact, which means you also have to and should put into your model the deferred tax assets, which we display with around €300 million which lowers, let's say, the net impact of the pensions.

Presidential general election debates are not inevitable. Our nation got along fine without them until 1960, when John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon contended on national television for the first time.
   
 There were no debates in 1964, 1968 or 1972, largely because sitting presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon declined to take on challengers.
   
 Indeed, in December, President Donald Trump, expressing his dissatisfaction with the Commission on Presidential Debates, hinted that he might sit out the presidential debates this year.
   
 He might be on to a sensible idea. Maybe 2020 would be a good year to skip the presidential debates altogether.
   
 I'd miss them. One reason I favored Pete Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination was the prospect of a debate between the mayor and the president. Buttigieg's calm, deliberate demeanor and his expository style -- he talks in sentences and paragraphs -- would contrast sharply with Trump's bluster and swagger and his patterns of language, which often shade into semi-incoherence.
   
 Such a debate would have been interesting, but would it have been informative? Speech-making is a presidential skill, but debating is not. And even speech- making isn't as vital to a president as other skills and qualities -- thoughtfulness, leadership, patience and cooperation, for example -- which are not necessarily demonstrated in a debate.
   
 Besides, the modern debate format, designed for television and the modern mind, is not conducive to a thoughtful exchange of ideas or an appreciation for their comparative value.
   
 The great prototype for political debate in our nation is the contest between Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln during the race for U.S. senator from Illinois in 1858. Throughout a series of seven debates, the first speaker was allotted an hour to make his case. His opponent responded for 90 minutes, followed by a half-hour rebuttal from the first speaker. No moderators, no commercials, no silly questions, interruptions or cross-talk.
   
 We would never tolerate this sort of extended discourse today. The modern format -- 90 seconds for answers, 45 seconds for rebuttal, and so on -- serves our national sensibility and attention span, but unfortunately not much else.
   
 Given the questionable value of presidential debates, do we really need them anyway in this particularly polarized year? Haven't the people largely made up their minds already?
   
 Whether Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden is ultimately nominated by the Democrats, the difference between the two of them is small compared with the difference between both of them and their presidential opponent. Citizens will not be choosing between a conservative and a liberal approach to governance. Particularly if the nominee is Biden, Americans will be choosing between our traditional understanding of American values and norms on one hand and an administration characterized by contempt for the traditional political infrastructure of our republic on the other.
   
 Of course, taking a pass on a presidential debate involves political cost. But Trump has already suggested the possibility. And the most likely Democratic candidate at present, Biden, isn't a strong debater, which probably indicates very little about what kind of a president he would be. Trump isn't a good debater, either, at least in any useful, traditional sense of the term, and we're already fully aware of what kind of president he is.
   
 At best, a Sanders/Trump or Biden/Trump matchup is likely to accomplish little more than put on display and exacerbate the deep political chasm that already exists in our nation.
   
 The choice itself is fairly uncomplicated: It is between normalcy and healing or more chaos and disruption, between decency and integrity or more bluster, dishonesty and incompetence. Whatever his faults and weaknesses, Joe Biden -- and even Bernie Sanders -- is an opportunity to reset our path toward our role as the world's essential rule-of-law republic. If that sounds like boilerplate liberal claptrap to you, then perhaps it illustrates how little use a presidential debate would be anyway.
   
 For the most part, Americans have already made up their minds. Come November, let's just vote. And then we'll know what sort of nation we actually are.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Wednesday postponed the upcoming World XI versus Asia XI matches, which would have marked the birth centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, owing to the coronavirus outbreak.
 The matches were scheduled to be played on March 21 and 22 in Dhaka and were set to include international stars such as Virat Kohli, Lasith Malinga and Chris Gayle.
 “There’s no guarantee that those who are supposed to play will be able to arrive, or can leave after the matches,” _ESPNCricinfo_ quoted BCB president Nazmul Hasan as saying. “There are a lot of restrictions, so we have deferred both programmes. We will organise after a month taking stock of the situation. It is postponed for the time being,” he added.
 He said that the matches have been “deferred” until further notice. The board also decided to postpone the AR Rahman concert at the Shere Bangla National Stadium, which was to be a part of the celebrations.

The future of laundry
 It's an exciting time for the laundry industry. Companies like Samsung and LG are taking more of an interest in the US market and we're seeing a lot of new features and technology as a result -- things like mega-capacity washing machines, app integration, models that come with sinks and even some that have secondary washers hiding in a traditional-looking front-load pedestal or a shallow top-load compartment.
 That's forcing other manufacturers to reimagine products that have been around for generations, leading to innovations like GE's voice control via Amazon Alexa. It also means that you have more options than ever before.
 So before you start dreaming about adding a supersize washer (and companion dryer) to your house, measure your laundry room space (and your doorways), weigh your cubic-foot-capacity needs against front- and top-load performance and efficiency trends. Think about your budget, too. And if you have more than $1,000 to spend on a washer, you might just be able to enjoy some of the new and innovative things we're seeing in the laundry market today.

LONDON: High Commissioner Mohammad Nafees Zakaria has said doctors and physicians of Pakistani heritage have achieved great successes in their respective fields and made Pakistan proud, while 1.5 million vibrant Pakistani diaspora serves as a strong bridge between the two countries.
 According to a press release, he was addressing the Association of Pakistani Physicians of Northern Europe (APPNE) as chief guest and patron of the organisation in Manchester on Saturday.
 The High Commissioner felicitated Dr Amir Burney, President APPNE and office- bearers and members on organising the first APPNE annual event. He commended the significant contribution of doctors and physicians of Pakistani heritage to the British society, particularly to the National Health Service (NHS) of the UK. He acknowledged the outstanding work of the community in promoting the true image of Pakistan in the UK and worldwide.
 On this occasion, Zakaria announced that the Pakistan High Commission would sponsor a bursary for Urdu Studies at the University of Manchester. "Urdu is the fourth most spoken language in the United Kingdom, of which a significant number resides in Manchester. With a view to enhancing community relations and assisting the work of public services in Manchester, this bursary would enable a selected public service employee to study Urdu at the University of Manchester," he elaborated.
 He commended the work and efforts of Shiraz Ali from the University of Manchester, Dr John Morley, Director of University-wide Language Programme and Dr Justyna Drobnik Rogers, for promotion of Urdu in the UK.
 He stressed that the Pakistan High Commission would continue to engage with the university for promotion of Urdu language in the UK. The High Commissioner also appreciated the positive contribution of Pakistan's renowned poet Amjad Islam Amjad, who attended the gathering, for promoting Urdu and Pakistani culture abroad.
 Dr Burney, President APPNE, briefed the gathering that the association was launched last year with the objective to bring doctors and physicians at one platform to work in a coordinated and coherent manner.

of matches being played in empty stadiums.
 No restrictions have yet been placed on games played in Britain and Liverpool will host Atletico Madrid on Wednesday (today) in front of a capacity crowd of more than 50,000.
 Nearly 3,000 Atletico fans are expected to travel for the game even though La Liga has announced that all matches in Spain will be played behind closed doors for the next two weeks.
 “Some things are more important than football, we realise that in this moment,” Liverpool boss Klopp said ahead of his side’s Champions League last-16, second-leg match.
 “I don’t know enough about how much it would help with the football games. The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together. I’m not sure what is better in this case.”
 Liverpool are expected to wrap up a first English league title in 30 years in the coming weeks but could do so in an empty stadium if authorities tighten the rules.
 The Champions League has been severely disrupted by the fast-spreading virus.
 Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona will play their second-leg matches behind closed doors, while it remains to be seen if Juventus can host Lyon next week with Italy in lockdown.
 Manchester City boss Guardiola believes it is only a matter of time before English clubs face further restrictions.
 City play Arsenal at home on Wednesday in a re-arranged Premier League game—when Guardiola will go head to head with his former assistant, Mikel Arteta.
 Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, does not want a prolonged period of games without fans. “We are here for the people. If it’s just one or two games, OK, but not longer,” he said. “We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn’t love it. But if (European governing body) UEFA or the government say we have to play without spectators, we will do it. The health is the most important thing and we have to take care of the situation.”
 Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, whose side are due to face Olympiakos in the Europa League on Thursday in an empty stadium in Greece, said football should stop instead of being played behind closed doors.
 “If we have to go we will. But we don’t agree—we’re not happy to go,” he told Sky Sports. “Behind closed doors doesn’t make sense,” he added. We’re pretending to live a normal life when things aren’t normal.”

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s powerful lower house of Parliament on Wednesday debated the worst Hindu-Muslim violence in decades in the Indian capital, with an angry opposition demanding a judicial probe and the resignation of the home minister for the police's failure to prevent the deaths of more than 50 people. Opposition Congress party lawmakers walked out after Home Minister Amit Shah praised the police for ending the rioting in northeastern areas of the capital within 36 hours and preventing it from spreading across New Delhi. The violence coincided with a state visit by U.S. President Donald Trump on Feb. 24-25. Armed mobs of Muslims and Hindus threw rocks, exchanged gunfire and burned hundreds of vehicles, homes and businesses. Shah blamed inflammatory speeches by the Congress party and some Muslim leaders for triggering the rioting. He said 52 people were killed on Feb. 24 and 25 and 526 were injured. He declined to say how many were Hindus or Muslims. Shah said 300 people came from neighboring Uttar Pradesh state to join the rioting. More than 2,600 people have been arrested or detained and an investigation is underway, he said. He didn't say who allegedly brought the 300 people to New Delhi. Asauddin Owaisi, chief of the opposition All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen party, accused Hindu nationalists of spreading hatred of minority Muslims. The clashes followed an opposition protest against a new citizenship law that fast-tracks naturalization for foreign-born religious minorities of all major faiths in South Asia except Islam. Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, a Congress party leader, accused the police of ignoring hundreds of distress calls from people who were under attack and failing to protect them. “In light of the scale of violence and consequent loss of...

The release, that was expected to be announced on Tuesday, is part of a deal signed by the United States and the Taliban last month that would allow US forces and Nato troops to withdraw from Afghanistan to end more than 18 years of war, reports the international media.
 The Taliban have demanded the release of prisoners as a confidence-building measure to pave way for opening direct their talks with the government after talks with the both sides and the United States individually. Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said on Twitter that the presidential palace would issue a decree with details of the process, and the release was contingent on security and peace developments.
 "The Afghan government has reached a framework based on which the release of prisoners will be in exchange for a significant reduction in the level of violence," he said. Mr. Ghani promised Monday to announce a decree to free the prisoners, after the US and a number of foreign dignitaries appeared to back his claim to the presidency by sending their representatives to his inauguration.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement Monday saying, "We also welcome President Ghani's announcement that he will issue a decree March 10 on Taliban prisoner release."
 Taliban officials said late Monday that a flurry of biometric identifications were being conducted on Taliban prisoners, hinting at a mass release, according to prisoners currently in lockup. The Taliban officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media.
 A senior Taliban leader in Doha, the group's political headquarters, said vehicles had been sent to an area near Bagram Prison, north of the capital Kabul, to fetch the freed fighters.
 "After our conversation with Zalmay Khalilzad (the US special envoy for Afghanistan) on Monday, in which he conveyed to us the release of our 5,000 prisoners, we sent vehicles to pick them up," he said.
 A government source said any release was unlikely in the coming days and could be weeks away.
 The issue has become one of the biggest sticking points in any progress toward peace, complicated further by differing wording of documents between the United States and the Taliban and the United States and the Afghan government.
 "The Taliban need this to show to their rank and file. For the foot soldiers on the ground, a reduction-in-violence agreement, a troop withdrawal agreement signed in Doha means nothing, fighters returning is something they can feel," said an Asian diplomat in Kabul.
 Khalilzad attended Ghani's swearing-in ceremony in Kabul on Monday. The president had previously rejected the Taliban demand for its fighters to be released.
 It was unclear whether prisoners would be released from other prisons aside from Bagram, a detention facility located next to a US military base.
 It was also not known how many prisoners would be released initially, but there were reports that it could be between 1,000 and 1,800.
 A senior government official, who declined to be named, said on Tuesday: "In principle we have agreed to release prisoners in order to show our commitment toward bringing peace in Afghanistan but in what conditions the government is going to release them and how many, will be in the decree later this afternoon."
 He said the release would not be on Tuesday or Wednesday but could be "within weeks or months".
 Suhail Shaheen, Taliban’ political spokesman in Qatar, said in a Tweet that his group had handed a detailed list of all 5,000 prisoners to the United States and was waiting for all to be released.
 "It will be acceptable only when they are handed over to us in a desert or in detention centers under the observation of our prison officials,' he said.
 The US embassy declined to comment. A spokesman for Nato's mission referred questions to the Afghan government.
 Abdul Shukoor Qudoosi, governor of Bagram district, said his office had reports of an unusual arrival of multiple buses in the area, but they could not confirm what the buses were for or whether they were connected to the release.
 The Taliban leader in Doha also confirmed they had finalised arrangements for the release of 1,000 prisoners held by them, adding that they had shifted all prisoners to safe locations in Afghanistan.
 "We are planning to release the 1,000 prisoners of the Afghan government to the Red Crescent and they could then shift them to their hometowns or pay them cash for traveling home," he said.
 Meanwhile, the United States began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, the US military said Tuesday, taking a step forward on its peace deal with the Taliban while also praising Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's promise to start releasing Taliban prisoners after he had delayed for over a week.
 US military spokesman in Afghanistan Sonny Leggett said in a statement Tuesday that the military had begun its "conditions-based reduction of forces to 8,600 over 135 days."
 Currently, the US has about 13,000 soldiers in Afghanistan – 8,000 of whom are involved in training and advising Afghanistan's National Security Forces, while about 5,000 are involved in anti-terror operations and militarily supporting the Afghan army when they are requested.

ANKARA: The European Union should stop "stringing Turkey along" over helping out with the millions of migrants on its territory, the country's foreign minister has said.
 The remarks came a day after the two sides agreed to review a four-year-old deal aimed at stemming refugee flows to Europe. Mevlut Cavusoglu said the EU has to take "sincere" steps to help Turkey manage the flow of migrants, including finding ways to ensure Syrian refugees can return home.
 The minister spoke a day after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held a meeting with top EU officials in Brussels during which the sides agreed to review their 2016 deal on migrants. The meeting was called after thousands of migrants massed on Turkey's border with Greece, following the Turkish government's decision to open its borders to migrants wanting to cross into Europe. Greece has deployed riot police and border guards to prevent the crossings, sparking clashes between migrants and Greek security forces.
 Following the talks in Brussels late on Monday, European Council President Charles Michel said teams headed by Cavusoglu and EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borell, would work "in the next days to clarify the implementation of the deal between Turkey and the EU to be certain that we are on the same page". "We are ready for a constructive study ... We expect sincerity from the EU. The era of stringing Turkey along is over," Cavusoglu told state-run Anadolu Agency. Cavusoglu said the sides would work toward "updating" the Turkey-EU deal in line with recent developments, including the situation in Syria's northwestern Idlib province, where a Syrian government offensive has driven thousands of Syrians toward the border with Turkey.

 KARACHI/LONDON/TEHRAN: Twelve new cases of the novel coronavirus were discovered in Pakistan between Monday and Tuesday, taking the country's tally to 19, as the global death toll from Covid-19 reached 4,067, with more than 115,124 cases recorded from 105 countries.
 Three fresh cases were confirmed on Tuesday - two in Sindh and one in Balochistan. The development came after nine virus cases were detected in the province overnight.
 In Karachi, a major corporation shut down its seafront offices on Tuesday after an employee was diagnosed with the virus. The company said as a precautionary measure, it shut down its office for three days.
 The second individual diagnosed with coronavirus was found in Hyderabad, the Sindh health department said. "#Sindh Health Department has 2 new cases of #CoronaVirusPakistan The first case is from Hyderabad & the patient arrived from Syria via Doha. The second case is from Karachi & the patient arrived from Iran via Dubai. This brings the total number of cases to 15 in Sindh," tweeted Meeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health department.
 The third case of the day surfaced in Quetta where a 12-year-old boy contracted the virus who crossed into Pakistan from Iran-Pakistan border at Taftan, media reported.
 On Monday night, Sindh's health authorities announced that as many as nine more people, who had reached Karachi from Syria and Britain, had tested positive for Covid-19 and were being treated at three different hospitals in the city.
 Meanwhile, the interior ministry on Tuesday extended the closure of Pakistan- Afghan border at Chaman for the next seven days to adopt further preventive measures in a bid to overcome the spread of coronavirus.
 The increasing number of coronavirus cases in the country led to rumours Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches in Karachi would be cancelled. Refuting such talk, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail stated that the matches would be held in Karachi and across the country "as per schedule and the people should have no need to fear about the disturbance in its schedule".
 However, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Peechuho said the decision on PSL matches would be made "in the next few days" and "any such decision, if required, could only be made by [Sindh] Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah -- that too on recommendation of the task force constituted by him to monitor the emerging situation".
 Since the novel coronavirus first emerged in late December 2019, more than 115,124 cases have been recorded in 105 countries and territories, killing 4,067 people, according to an AFP tally compiled on Tuesday based on official sources. More than 15,000 cases have been counted in Europe. The worst affected countries are mainland China, (80,754 cases, of which 3,136 deaths), Italy (9,172 cases, 463 deaths), South Korea (7,513 cases, 54 deaths), Iran (8,042 cases, 291 deaths) and France (1,412 cases, 25 deaths). Mongolia and northern Cyprus announced their first cases on Tuesday. Iran reported 54 new deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day toll since the start of the outbreak in the country, bringing the number of those killed by the virus to 291.
 In Britain, a total of 373 people tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, up from 319 at the same point on Monday, the Department of Health said.
 England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said the start of the UK peak of the coronavirus epidemic is expected within the next fortnight. She defended the government's decision to delay closing schools and the introduction of other stringent tactics, saying experts are assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a "balanced response".
 But new measures -- including those aimed at protecting the elderly and vulnerable -- are expected shortly as cases rise more rapidly across the UK. The FCO said US authorities are planning a flight on Tuesday to repatriate British nationals on the Grand Princess cruise ship at the Port of Oakland, California.
 Health minister Jo Churchill said some patients can expect to wait longer for NHS treatment as doctors prioritise those with more serious illness and multiple underlying health conditions first. The Foreign Office confirmed it was in contact with Britons in Vietnam after reports of nine new cases confirmed among travellers on board the same flight from London to Hanoi on March 2, including seven British citizens.
 Hundreds of flights between the UK and Italy were cancelled due to the virus, leaving some passengers stranded.
 In France, where five parliamentarians have been infected, Culture Minister Franck Riester contracted the coronavirus and is staying at home.
 In Ireland, St Patrick's Day parades scheduled on March 17 across the country have been cancelled, as is the parade in the US city of Boston. All matches in the world judo championships are cancelled until April 30.
 In Italy, 60 million of its people were ordered to "stay at home" from Tuesday in a government decree which allows travel only for the most urgent work or health reasons. The football league was suspended until April 3 and Austria banned entry for people from Italy, unless they have a doctor's certificate. Romania and Slovenia respectively banned gatherings of more than 1,000 and 100 people. Barcelona's Champions League round of 16 return match against Napoli on March 18 will be played behind closed doors.
 Israel imposed a two-week quarantine on all arrivals. The measure, already in force for several European countries, has so far spared countries such as the United States.
 In China, more than 70 per cent of those who have been infected have been cured since the epidemic broke out. The central Chinese province of Hubei, the epicentre of the coronavirus, eased travel restrictions on its inhabitants. China's President Xi Jinping, on a visit to the provincial capital Wuhan, said the epidemic had been "basically curbed" there.
 In the United States, five members of Congress, including at least two Republicans who have mixed with President Donald Trump, are in voluntary confinement after being exposed to the coronavirus. Trump himself has not been tested.

PARIS: A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said on Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment.
 The so-called "London Patient", a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months.
 Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were "even more remarkable" and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. "We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus," Gupta told AFP.
 The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer.
 In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold.
 He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the "Berlin Patient", recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment.
 Viral tests of Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV "fossils"-- fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. "We'd expect that," he said. "It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body."
 Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo's treatment was a "last resort" as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta.
 The Cambridge doctor said that there were "several other" patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. "There will probably be more but they will take time," he said.
 Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration.
 "You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-per cent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing," he said.
 Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. "Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?" she said. "Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell."

Dr Safdar Sohail, Special Secretary Cabinet Division, was first convener of the Joint Working Group on Industrial Cooperation when the CPEC was conceived and materialized into billions of dollar projects.
 He also disclosed that both sides decided to establish Industry Cooperation Fund but that was never materialized. Dr Safdar remained affiliated with the CPEC at different positions in the past. He was the lead negotiator on CPEC Long Term Plan and then served as the founding Executive Director of CPEC Center of Excellence.
 He made these bold and blunt remarks during a one-day dialogue on industrial cooperation under the CPEC and SEZs framework arranged by the Board of Investment here.
 Dr Safdar said he was using the harsh word of “stunting” for the CPEC Long Term Plan because it failed to achieve the strategic institutional thickening.
 He said corporations on both sides joined hands with the help of some political elites and a handful of bureaucrats, channelizing their investments into such ventures where the short- term benefits were personalized and long- term risks were socialized.
 Dr Safdar further said the titled CPEC LTP agreed in November 2017 did not lend itself to any kind of 'mutually constitutive' development alliance.
 “This 'aspirational plan’ actually is an amalgamation of old China-Pakistan Cooperation Agreement, LTP Outline MoU and Draft Production Capacity MoU 2015, leaving Chinese and Pakistani LTP aside” he added.
 “It was a bad luck for the LTP process that the mid-level officials of NDRC coordinating the Early Harvest Program (EHP) had also taken in their hands to conclude the LTP. They were somehow averse to accepting any long-term commitments with Pakistan, he added.
 Now, he said both sides had the new terms of second phase, without clearly speaking what the first phase was and without evaluating the performance of the first phase under the CPEC.
 For way forward, he suggested that there was a need to create conditions for a reset of CPEC starting with the vision and goals, setting new priorities and new framework of a Long Term Strategic Economic Partnership between Pakistan and China.
 Without a major upgradation of governance capacity, he said the chances of optimally benefitting from the CPEC would continue to be slim. But, CPEC could not wait for an overhaul of the whole governance apparatus. Therefore, there is a need to go for a selective institutional thickening both at the federal and local level which has a demonstrated capacity of being effective, he added.
 For industrial development, he suggested enhancing governance capacity of trade and investment officers, aligning Development Policies and internal policy reform agenda with CPEC by building industrial infrastructure and upgrading Regulatory and Policy Support System e.g. early establishment of already approved Exim Bank and Land Port Authority of Pakistan, adopting a strategic Industrial Policy; choosing champions but also defending legitimate interests of the local industry, upgrading the Business Environment, reducing litigations, frauds, managing land issues, security, enhance ease of doing business, preparing for bigger inflows of Chinese aid, re-socializing Pakistani firms and policy community towards China and overcoming synergy deficit among government ministries through greater collaborative efforts.

MOSCOW (AP) — The Russian parliament approved a sweeping constitutional reform in the third and final reading Wednesday, a move that will allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power for another 12 years after his current term ends in 2024.
 The Kremlin-controlled lower house, the State Duma, endorsed a set of amendments to the constitution and a provision resetting the term count for Putin after the revised constitution goes into force. It passed by a 383-0 vote with 43 abstentions.
 A nationwide vote on the proposed amendments is set for April 22.
 Kremlin critics condemned the move as a cynical manipulation and called for protests.
 Putin, a 67-year-old former KGB officer, has ruled Russia for more than 20 years. After serving for two consecutive four-year terms — a limit outlined in the current version of the constitution — Putin shifted to prime minister’s seat in 2008, with his close ally Dmitry Medvedev becoming a placeholder president.
 The length of the presidency was extended to six years under Medvedev, and in 2012 Putin returned to the Kremlin as president. In 2018, he was re-elected for another six years.
 Putin has weathered several international storms during his 20 years in power. The 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, which prompted a drawn-out, years-long conflict with Ukraine, significantly boosted his approval ratings back at home.
 As Moscow’s relations with the West soured over the 2014 annexation and more scandals followed, the Kremlin kept Putin’s popularity high by painting Russia as a besieged fortress in need of a strong leader to withstand the outside pressure.
 The constitutional reform passed by the Duma on Wednesday would allow Putin to run for presidency two more times after 2024. Before the national vote, it will be reviewed by Russia’s Constitutional Court.
 The changes redistribute the executive powers of the Russian government in Moscow and further strengthen the power of the presidency, while also banning same-sex marriage and listing “a belief in God” as one of Russia’s traditional values.
 The proposal to restart the term clock for the current president was put forward by 83-year-old former Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, now a Duma deputy, during the second reading of the amendments on Tuesday. Following Tereshkova’s speech, Putin quickly arrived at parliament to address the lawmakers and supported the idea.
 The move prompted immediate calls for protests from various opposition groups. On Tuesday night, about 200 people gathered near the Kremlin and lined up to hold solo pickets — the only form of protest in Russia that it legal without prior authorization from the government — against the reform.
 “It was clear from the start that it is being done to keep Putin in power forever,” opposition activist Alexei Miniaylo, who called for the pickets on his Facebook page on Tuesday, told The Associated Press. “But the brazen manner in which it was done elicited outrage.”
 Two opposition groups called for a bigger rally in Moscow on March 21 or March 22 and applied for authorization with the city authorities. Soon after, Moscow City Hall announced banning outdoor events with attendance of more than 5,000 until April 10, saying it was part of precautionary steps to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
 Activists remained unfazed, however, and on Wednesday morning refiled their requests, amending the maximum number of participants from 50,000 to 4,500. “Our position is that if the coronarivus is such a dangerous threat, then they should cancel the vote (on the constitutional reform), as it can expose millions of people to infection,” Mikhail Svetov, leader of the Civil Society movement, told the AP. “And if it is not that dangerous, then rallies should be allowed.”
 Pickets and protests were being organized in other Russian cities as well, said Tatyana Usmanova, an activist with the “No” group formed two months ago to coordinate the opposition effort against the reform.
 “It gets to people, because it is totally out of line,” Usmanova said.

The release, that was expected to be announced on Tuesday, is part of a deal signed by the United States and the Taliban last month that would allow US forces and Nato troops to withdraw from Afghanistan to end more than 18 years of war, reports the international media.
 The Taliban have demanded the release of prisoners as a confidence-building measure to pave way for opening direct their talks with the government after talks with the both sides and the United States individually.
 Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani, said on Twitter that the presidential palace would issue a decree with details of the process, and the release was contingent on security and peace developments.
 "The Afghan government has reached a framework based on which the release of prisoners will be in exchange for a significant reduction in the level of violence," he said.
 Mr. Ghani promised Monday to announce a decree to free the prisoners, after the US and a number of foreign dignitaries appeared to back his claim to the presidency by sending their representatives to his inauguration.
 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo released a statement Monday saying, "We also welcome President Ghani's announcement that he will issue a decree March 10 on Taliban prisoner release."
 Taliban officials said late Monday that a flurry of biometric identifications were being conducted on Taliban prisoners, hinting at a mass release, according to prisoners currently in lockup. The Taliban officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to talk to the media.
 A senior Taliban leader in Doha, the group's political headquarters, said vehicles had been sent to an area near Bagram Prison, north of the capital Kabul, to fetch the freed fighters.
 "After our conversation with Zalmay Khalilzad (the US special envoy for Afghanistan) on Monday, in which he conveyed to us the release of our 5,000 prisoners, we sent vehicles to pick them up," he said.
 A government source said any release was unlikely in the coming days and could be weeks away.
 The issue has become one of the biggest sticking points in any progress toward peace, complicated further by differing wording of documents between the United States and the Taliban and the United States and the Afghan government.
 “The Taliban need this to show to their rank and file. For the foot soldiers on the ground, a reduction-in-violence agreement, a troop withdrawal agreement signed in Doha means nothing, fighters returning is something they can feel,” said an Asian diplomat in Kabul.
 Khalilzad attended Ghani’s swearing-in ceremony in Kabul on Monday. The president had previously rejected the Taliban demand for its fighters to be released.
 It was unclear whether prisoners would be released from other prisons aside from Bagram, a detention facility located next to a US military base.
 It was also not known how many prisoners would be released initially, but there were reports that it could be between 1,000 and 1,800.
 A senior government official, who declined to be named, said on Tuesday: “In principle we have agreed to release prisoners in order to show our commitment toward bringing peace in Afghanistan but in what conditions the government is going to release them and how many, will be in the decree later this afternoon.”
 He said the release would not be on Tuesday or Wednesday but could be “within weeks or months”.
 Suhail Shaheen, Taliban’ political spokesman in Qatar, said in a Tweet that his group had handed a detailed list of all 5,000 prisoners to the United States and was waiting for all to be released.
 “It will be acceptable only when they are handed over to us in a desert or in detention centers under the observation of our prison officials,’ he said. The US embassy declined to comment. A spokesman for Nato’s mission referred questions to the Afghan government.
 Abdul Shukoor Qudoosi, governor of Bagram district, said his office had reports of an unusual arrival of multiple buses in the area, but they could not confirm what the buses were for or whether they were connected to the release.
 The Taliban leader in Doha also confirmed they had finalised arrangements for the release of 1,000 prisoners held by them, adding that they had shifted all prisoners to safe locations in Afghanistan.
 “We are planning to release the 1,000 prisoners of the Afghan government to the Red Crescent and they could then shift them to their hometowns or pay them cash for traveling home,” he said.
 Meanwhile, the United States began withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, the US military said Tuesday, taking a step forward on its peace deal with the Taliban while also praising Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s promise to start releasing Taliban prisoners after he had delayed for over a week.
 US military spokesman in Afghanistan Sonny Leggett said in a statement Tuesday that the military had begun its “conditions-based reduction of forces to 8,600 over 135 days.”
 Currently, the US has about 13,000 soldiers in Afghanistan – 8,000 of whom are involved in training and advising Afghanistan’s National Security Forces, while about 5,000 are involved in anti-terror operations and militarily supporting the Afghan army when they are requested.

The so-called “London Patient”, a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months.
 Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were “even more remarkable” and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. “We’ve tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,” Gupta told AFP.
 The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, a deadly cancer.
 In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold.
 He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the “Berlin Patient”, recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment.
 Viral tests of Castillejo’s cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV “fossils”— fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. “We’d expect that,” he said. “It’s quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body.”
 Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo’s treatment was a “last resort” as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta.
 The Cambridge doctor said that there were “several other” patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. “There will probably be more but they will take time,” he said.
 Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration.
 “You’d have to weigh up the fact that there’s a 10-per cent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,” he said.
 Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. “Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?” she said. “Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell.”

_Saints Row: The Third_ was originally released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC platforms back in 2011 and was the third main game in the series. It was praised for its more laidback approach to open-world mayhem and the way it built on past Saints Row games, so it's not too surprising that Deep Silver would choose it as a candidate for a remaster if that's indeed what's happened.

LIVERPOOL: Jurgen Klopp said on Tuesday he was unsure whether closing stadiums would help tackle the coronavirus as Pep Guardiola admitted he did not like the idea
 of matches being played in empty stadiums.
 No restrictions have yet been placed on games played in Britain and Liverpool will host Atletico Madrid on Wednesday (today) in front of a capacity crowd of more than 50,000.
 Nearly 3,000 Atletico fans are expected to travel for the game even though La Liga has announced that all matches in Spain will be played behind closed doors for the next two weeks.
 "Some things are more important than football, we realise that in this moment," Liverpool boss Klopp said ahead of his side's Champions League last-16, second-leg match.
 "I don't know enough about how much it would help with the football games. The problem with football games is if you are not at the stadium you are in closed rooms watching, maybe together. I'm not sure what is better in this case."
 Liverpool are expected to wrap up a first English league title in 30 years in the coming weeks but could do so in an empty stadium if authorities tighten the rules.
 The Champions League has been severely disrupted by the fast-spreading virus.
 Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona will play their second-leg matches behind closed doors, while it remains to be seen if Juventus can host Lyon next week with Italy in lockdown.
 Manchester City boss Guardiola believes it is only a matter of time before English clubs face further restrictions.
 City play Arsenal at home on Wednesday in a re-arranged Premier League game-- when Guardiola will go head to head with his former assistant, Mikel Arteta.
 Guardiola, whose side are due to host Real Madrid in the Champions League next week, does not want a prolonged period of games without fans. "We are here for the people. If it's just one or two games, OK, but not longer," he said. "We play for them and if they cannot be there, then there is no sense. I wouldn't love it. But if (European governing body) UEFA or the government say we have to play without spectators, we will do it. The health is the most important thing and we have to take care of the situation."
 Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo, whose side are due to face Olympiakos in the Europa League on Thursday in an empty stadium in Greece, said football should stop instead of being played behind closed doors.
 "If we have to go we will. But we don't agree--we're not happy to go," he told Sky Sports. "Behind closed doors doesn't make sense," he added. We're pretending to live a normal life when things aren't normal."

ISLAMABAD: He was asked to submit his reply before March 10 whether he surrendered his US citizenship before or after the filing of his nomination papers. But he failed to comply with the Election Commission of Pakistan's directions. The commission has again directed Federal Minister for Water Resources Faisal Vawda to submit his reply till March 24.
 Vawda allegedly concealed his dual nationality and lied on oath before the ECP authorities that he was a Pakistani national only. However, contrary to his claim, documents revealed that he was an American citizen at the time of filing nomination papers in the General Elections 2018.
 The election commission received four petitions challenging the dual nationality of Faisal Vawda. The first hearing of the case was held on February 03 and the petitioners were asked to submit verified documents, including the renunciation letter attested by the US Embassy in Pakistan. The second hearing of the case was held on February 27 and Vawda was asked to submit his reply on the allegations of concealing his dual nationality and lying on oath about his American citizenship till March 10.
 However, the legal team of Faisal Vawda appeared before the commission on Tuesday (March 10) and informed it that they hadn't received the copies of petitions and other documents. The commission, while expressing its annoyance, directed them to submit the reply till March 24. During the hearing, Vawda's legal team was provided the copies of petitions and other documents. The commission was assured by the counsel for the federal minister that they would submit the reply by next hearing i.e. March 24.
 Talking to The News, Faisal Vawda's lawyer Mr Muhammad confirmed that they had received the copies of the petition and other relevant documents. "We will review the petitions and relevant documents and submit our reply before the next hearing," he commented.
 Earlier, Chairman Aman Taraqqi Party Muhammad Faiq Shah on the directions of ECP had applied for verification of Faisal Vawda's renunciation letter from the US Embassy. However, the American Embassy on February 16 refused to verify as the information regarding loss of one's nationality comes under the category of "Private Information".
 "Mr Shah, I am responding to your recent letter to Consul General Silberstein dated February 11, 2020 to inform you that we do not comment on individual renunciation cases," reads the Consulate General of the United States' letter to Chairman Aman Taraqqi Party.
 It is important to note here that the last date to file the nomination papers for the elections held in July 2018 was June 8 and later extended for another three days. Taking his document as evidence, Vawda submitted the election papers on the last date -- June 11, 2018 --along with an affidavit wherein he declared himself holding no citizenship other than Pakistani. The Returning Officer (RO) of NA-249, Karachi, his electoral constituency, approved his nomination papers on June 18, 2018. It was only after this approval that Vawda applied for renunciation of his US nationality in the US Consulate, Karachi, meaning thereby he was an American citizen at the time of filing.
 Vawda applied for revocation of his American citizenship in the US Consulate Karachi on June 22, 2018 (Friday). Normally, the process of renunciation of the US nationality takes a couple of weeks or even months because it requires clearance from all the concerned departments. However, the US consulate issued the 'Certificate of Loss of Nationality' to Vawda on the next working day i.e. June 25, 2018 (Monday), reveal the documents available with The News.
 The Supreme Court of Pakistan in its recent judgment categorically directed that candidates who previously held dual nationality shall have the renunciation certificate at the time of filing of nomination papers. Various legislators were disqualified by the top court on this count; included among them are two senators of PML-N. Both of them had applied for renunciation of foreign citizenship much earlier but were unable to obtain the renunciation certificate at the time of filing of nomination papers because of the long process.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that the financial institutions are not required to obtain a decree from banking court to sell mortgaged properties for recovering defaulted loans.
 Announcing a majority judgment on a set of petitions regarding recovery of loans under Finance Institutions (recovery of finances) Ordinance 2001, a five-member larger bench Tuesday sustained Section 15 of the Ordinance, which allows the banks and financial institutions to sell mortgaged property for recovery of a defaulted loan after fulfilling certain rules. Chief Justice Mamoon Rashid Sheikh headed the larger bench comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh, Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Asim Hafeez. Detailed judgment will be issued soon. Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh dissented from the majority view. A single bench in 2016 had suspended Section 15 of the Ordinance as it was argued on behalf of the petitioners (industries and individuals) that the section had been reintroduced through Financial Institutions (recovery of finances) Amendment Act 2016 and was not sustainable in light of Supreme Court's judgments.
 Prime Minister Imran Khan during July 2019 at a ceremony of "Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme" had referred to the matter and requested the then chief justice for early disposal of the petitions. Later, then chief justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan had fixed hearing of the matter before a larger bench. During a previous hearing, a federal government law officer had urged the bench to recall the stay order as the government had been facing huge loss in terms of no recovery of defaulted loans worth billions of rupees. He said it happened nowhere in the world that people refused to return loans.
 He argued that the financial institutions should be allowed to auction the mortgaged properties to recover the defaulted loans. The lawyers from the petitioners' side had argued that the mortgaged properties could not be put to auction without calculation of payable amount. They said the mortgaged properties of the petitioners had never been evaluated. They said the Section 15 of the Ordinance was contrary to various provisions of the Constitution.

“This is a very dynamic situation, and we are evaluating all available options at this time,” Whitley said in an email. “We will communicate any decisions we make as soon as possible.”
 The CDC says schools do make these kinds of decisions on their own and should be consulting with local health officials to determine when schools should close and for how long.
 However, it does call for schools to ensure there is education and meal program continuity including determining if a waiver is needed for state requirements of a minimum number of in-person school days as a condition for funding or graduation.
 Dr. Danny Avula, Director of Richmond and Henrico Health Departments, said each school district is so different there are no firm thresholds or guidelines for deciding when to dismiss school and attempt remote learning.
 “Each school system has so many variables: their size, their ability and infrastructure to go online, the number of older folks on the faculty,” Avula said. “There are no clear times or guidelines to how many cases it takes to shut schools or, should it happen, how long you close before you can reopen.”
 He said all districts are aware their decisions have an impact on the others around them, so school officials have been in close communication to make sure everyone is on the same page.
 Representatives from all regional districts and higher education have been meeting as part of the Central Region Incident Management Team to work out details and continue with group decision making.
 He said as cases across the country continue to rise, the CDC will continue updating their guidance as well giving local officials a clearer picture on how to proceed.
 Fairfax County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, will close March 16 so teachers can “prepare for the possibility of distance learning in the event of a school closure.” Pulaski County Public Schools will be closed Friday so school officials can do the same.
 St. Michael’s Episcopal School made a similar decision by extending its spring break through Monday, March 16, to give teachers a professional development day.

 The handshake as we know it might date back to the 14th century, when knights and soldiers would extend their unclenched right hands toward each other in greeting to show that they were carrying no weapons.
 These days, it would seem, the potential weapon isn't a knife, but the hand itself. Or rather, its propensity for picking up and holding onto microbes from contaminated surfaces, or from our own eyes or noses when we have certain illnesses. Those germs can then be transferred into the hands of the people we greet, while we can pick up their germs. We then will probably touch our own eyes or noses or mouths, potentially sickening ourselves and restarting the cycle.
 Now that a novel coronavirus is spreading faster than Russian election propaganda, our hands are being cast in a new, suspicious light. We're being drilled in handwashing techniques as if we were all second-graders. With liquid hand sanitizers out of stock everywhere, we're being counseled on how to make our own out of alcohol and aloe vera gel. (Sadly, we may soon need a recipe for rubbing alcohol, which is also disappearing from store shelves.) And lately, the internet has been brimming with suggestions for socially acceptable ways to greet each other that don't involve passing viruses along blithely from one person to the next.
 Could this be the end of the handshake? Come to think of it, if it weren't such a habit, would we really miss a ritual so often fraught with judgment and calculation? (Too firm? Too limp? How about a hug? Or a nod? )
 Last Monday, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer waved off Chancellor Angela Merkel as she held out her hand to him; she laughed and praised him for it, and no one seemed worse off. Also that day, U.S. Surgeon Gen. Jerome Adams demonstrated the elbow bump as a less viral way to pass along friendly greetings; Vice President Mike Pence employed that technique on his visit to Washington state on Thursday.
 The tradition of clasped hands isn't the only greeting to undergo new scrutiny. A Maori tribe in New Zealand put the brakes on hongi, the traditional nose-to-nose hello. The French have been advised that the familiar cheek-kissing greeting should be abandoned for now. Maybe people will stop making fun of the Hollywood air kiss, though it's not a huge improvement health-wise.
 One goodwill suggestion making the rounds is putting our hands together namaste-style. Another one: jazz hands, up and wiggling. Oh, we hope not. This is starting to make the 1960s peace sign look good.
 COVID-19 is a real threat, and we don't take lightly the admonitions from health authorities who are trying to control its spread. We may, indeed, need to keep our hands to ourselves for the time being. But we're not ready to send physical greeting rituals like the handshake into the dustbin of history. Humans crave making a physical connection with friends and often with relative strangers. For now, perhaps, a rueful smile and nod might work as a common acknowledgment of our friendly intentions not to infect or be infected by others.

MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — Two women were killed and a man was shot near the western Montana town of Stevensville and the suspect was arrested after a chase that ended in a crash in a yard in Missoula, Ravalli County officials said. Sheriff Steve Holton said his office is investigating Tuesday's shooting as a domestic violence incident and there is evidence the suspect was under the influence of drugs. The injured man gave officers a description of the shooter's vehicle and a Montana Highway Patrol trooper spotted the black Camaro on U.S. Highway 93 in Lolo at about 7 p.m., Holton said. Troopers put out spike strips but the driver avoided them. “The suspect took off and ended up in a pursuit with Missoula County Sheriff’s deputies, Ravalli County Sheriff’s deputies and Missoula Police officers before the suspect wrecked his vehicle in Missoula,\" Holton said. The suspect was arrested at about 8 p.m. and was booked into the Ravalli County jail on suspicion of deliberate homicide, assault with a weapon and criminal endangerment. Holton did not release the names of the victims, who are in their 20s, as is the suspect, Holton said. The injured man is hospitalized in Missoula.

That’s what is happening at the MAC tournament in Cleveland, at the behest of Ohio’s governor. They’ll determine a champion with the crowd limited to credentialed attendees — operations staff, media, school officials — and team traveling parties. The Big West will do the same in Long Beach, Calif.
 (The Ivy League, with its typical utter lack of common sense and innate self- sabotage when it comes to athletics, canceled its tournament entirely instead of playing it behind closed doors.)
 But with the First Four in Dayton and a first-weekend site in Cleveland, the NCAA Tournament is inexorably headed that direction as well. Turner Broadcasting executives Tuesday morning acknowledged they could broadcast the Final Four from somewhere other than Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and Georgia Tech’s newly renovated McCamish Pavilion makes all the sense in the world for a scaled-down crowd limited to families and bands and cheerleaders.
 The NBA and NHL have held off as long as they can, but the San Jose Sharks face the very real possibility of playing home games in an empty arena and they almost certainly will not be the last.
 No one wants this, the people who sold all the tickets even less than the people who bought them, but with the United States at what may be an inflection point with regard to the spread of the virus, large public gatherings like sporting events just aren’t worth it. Especially with the travel inherent in postseason basketball.
 All the dominoes are falling. Everything is leaning that way. And it’s the smart thing to do.
 “After consultation with local and state health authorities, including the Governor and his medical staff, the Atlantic Coast Conference will hold its men’s basketball tournament as scheduled this week at the Greensboro Coliseum,” the ACC said in a prepared statement. “As was outlined by the Governor during his press conference, high-risk individuals are discouraged from attending mass gatherings.”
 Keeping the media out of locker rooms — for some reason, the first instinct of every league, pro and college — is a symbolic but largely pointless gesture from an epidemiological perspective. The real danger of spreading the novel coronavirus isn’t interactions between dozens of players and dozens of reporters; it’s 20,000 people sitting inches from each other for four hours. By the end of the weekend, tens of thousands of people will have shared the air in the Greensboro Coliseum, sneezing on each other, touching the same surfaces, then dispersing across the east coast.

Announcing a majority judgment on a set of petitions regarding recovery of loans under Finance Institutions (recovery of finances) Ordinance 2001, a five-member larger bench Tuesday sustained Section 15 of the Ordinance, which allows the banks and financial institutions to sell mortgaged property for recovery of a defaulted loan after fulfilling certain rules. Chief Justice Mamoon Rashid Sheikh headed the larger bench comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh, Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Asim Hafeez. Detailed judgment will be issued soon. Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh dissented from the majority view. A single bench in 2016 had suspended Section 15 of the Ordinance as it was argued on behalf of the petitioners (industries and individuals) that the section had been reintroduced through Financial Institutions (recovery of finances) Amendment Act 2016 and was not sustainable in light of Supreme Court’s judgments.
 Prime Minister Imran Khan during July 2019 at a ceremony of “Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme” had referred to the matter and requested the then chief justice for early disposal of the petitions. Later, then chief justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan had fixed hearing of the matter before a larger bench. During a previous hearing, a federal government law officer had urged the bench to recall the stay order as the government had been facing huge loss in terms of no recovery of defaulted loans worth billions of rupees. He said it happened nowhere in the world that people refused to return loans.
 He argued that the financial institutions should be allowed to auction the mortgaged properties to recover the defaulted loans. The lawyers from the petitioners’ side had argued that the mortgaged properties could not be put to auction without calculation of payable amount. They said the mortgaged properties of the petitioners had never been evaluated. They said the Section 15 of the Ordinance was contrary to various provisions of the Constitution.

FORT MYERS, Fla. — For one part of the Cardinals’ plan for a rebuilt bench, the offer came later than he hoped.For the other, it arrived in the nick of time.Brad Miller, a former starter at shortstop, signed as a free agent on the eve of spring training, and was drawn by a major-league offer and the chance to find a fit as the lefthanded-hitting utility fielder the Cardinals have long coveted. Rangel Ravelo had a lucrative agreement to play in Korea this year and was awaiting the Cardinals’ approval, when they, having altered their roster, presented him a different idea: Be their one-hit wonder in a pinch.The left-right combination the Cardinals imagine for their bench contributed to the Cardinals’ lone rally Tuesday against Boston at JetBlue Park, coming from different sides of the plate and different avenues to the same opportunity. And same reality. He who hits, sticks.“They told me there would be a lot of opportunities for me, but they weren’t really sure where it was going to be,” Miller said. “They wanted me to join a really good group of guys. From my standpoint, all I wanted to do was get my foot in the door.”Miller returned from a sore back to the starting lineup Tuesday to handle third base and deliver the Cardinals’ two runs in a 3-2 loss. The 30-year-old newcomer had not appeared in a game since Feb. 27, and as he rested and recovered the look of the Cardinals’ roster around him shifted, dramatically. The incumbent utility infielder, Yairo Munoz, skipped at least one scheduled appointment with the team doctors and returned home to the Dominican Republic. In an abrupt move, the Cardinals released Munoz, and he became a free agent Monday. Clarity continued to come to the bench Tuesday.With Munoz gone, the Cardinals no longer have any of the hitters who took more than 20 pinch-hit at-bats for them. Ravelo is the returning leader with a .250 average (five-for-20) and five RBIs in pinch-hit spots. The Cardinals see him as the replacement for Jose Martinez, one of the leading pinch-hitters in the game, who was traded to Tampa Bay just in time to keep Ravelo from heading to Korea.“We were just waiting on the Cardinals to give consent,” he said.Including Ravelo, five of the six players who took at least 15 pinch-hit at-bats were righthanded, all as part of a team that leaned hard right as well. Miller brings that lefthanded sock that also had a .938 OPS and a .600 slugging percentage against righthanded pitchers last season.The Cardinals have five spots on their 26-man roster for the bench, and Miller would join backup catcher Matt Wieters and complement switch-hitter Tommy Edman, Ravelo and a fourth outfielder, like Lane Thomas.Manager Mike Shildt stressed that there are still a couple spots open for competition. But the answers are increasingly obvious. As part of the Cardinals’ two-run rally in the first inning Tuesday, Edman drew a walk, Ravelo loaded the bases with a two-out walk, and Miller lined a single off a lefty over the second baseman’s head for a quick two-out, 2-0 lead. Later in the game, Thomas entered and stole a base.“There are a lot of different ways we look to compete,” Shildt said. “We let them come in for defense. Thomas did take a bag when it was there. There are a lot of different variables you look for in your bench, and they’re all independent of each other. We don’t want a redundancy, necessarily.”As the Cardinals seek ways to improve the offense, they’re workshopping a new look to the top of the order and upgrading the work for pitchers but also eyeing the bench for a boost. The Cardinals’ pinch-hitters ranked in the National League’s lower-third for on- base percentage and ninth for OPS (.688), and until Edman roared into a starting role the complements were lacking.This spring, Ravelo has played first, left and right to see how many positions he might fit in the case of a double-switch. Edman and Miller will also see time in the outfield in the closing weeks of spring, and both have received reps at shortstop. Rookie Edmundo Sosa remains a contender for the bench because of his glove, but it’s the bats of Miller, Ravelo and Edman that the Cardinals see as movable pieces — and productive.Miller took several at-bats during live batting practice Monday in Jupiter, Florida, to ready for his return to the lineup. Tuesday was the year anniversary of his first spring game in 2019, so he feels there is plenty of time to gather momentum and timing for the season.He’s already better having learned a lesson about rushing.“In the past, I’ve ignored how my body has felt, and I ended up doing some real damage,” Miller said. “Some of my hip injuries I’ve had stemmed from something small that I played through them and pushed them and it was not very smart. I didn’t communicate properly. I wanted to use my experience, my bad experience before, and the goal is to be ready for opening day. All systems go.”Miller finished one-for-two in the game, and he had grounders that tested him at third base. In the fifth, he moved to his left, spun and threw to first in time to get Boston’s cleanup hitter Xander Bogaerts by a step.Ravelo singled later in the game to finish one-for-three. He and Edman lead the team in spring at-bats with 35 and 36, respectively. Only Paul DeJong (13) and Dylan Carlson (10) have more hits than the two bench bats. Ravelo talked about preparing “physically and mentally for what could happen in the fifth inning, the sixth inning, or whatever inning and coming off the bench.”When the Cardinals pivoted and had him stay, he knew why.“I’ve had some good years hitting-wise,” he said, leaving the ballpark Tuesday evening, “and I think that’s what is guiding their decision to keeping me here.”As long as he does, they will.

 The vacation rental industry is lucrative -- the website, ipropertymanagement.com, projected worldwide vacation rental revenue for 2019 at around $57.6 billion. Of the 97 properties that the county knows about, an estimated $134,000 is generated in transient tax revenue.
 Given that this county has so much going for it — water sports, hiking, biking, history and more — wouldn’t it be great to capitalize on that? Interested homeowners could partner with the county to market their properties based on location and nearby amenities. It could not only draw folks to visit the area, but once they see all that Franklin County has to offer, that visit could compel them to put down roots here, too.

Technical chart claims that MGM Resorts International (MGM) would settle between $22.17/share to $23.56/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $18.65 mark, then the market for MGM Resorts International becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $16.52 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -2.44. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

The Scottish Criminal Case Review Commission (SCCRC) has referred to the Lockerbie bombing case to the High Court allowing the man convicted for the incident to file a fresh appeal.The London to New York Pan Am flight 103 was blown up in mid-air over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 killing all 270 people on board, mostly American.The Scottish commission said its decision was based after it conducted a review of new material which allowed the family of the late Abdel Basset al-Megrahi to appeal the conviction.Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was the only person convicted of the crime. Abdel Basset died in 2012 after being released three years earlier by Scotlands government on compassionate grounds after being diagnosed with cancer.Megrahi was found guilty of the bombing in 2001 and was jailed for life. Megrahi, however, always claimed to be innocent. US and British investigators had indicted Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah on murder charge and accused them of being Libyan intelligence officers.The duo was formally charged in 1999 at The Hague after Libya handed them over to Dutch authorities. Fhimah was found not guilty and was sent home.

The handshake as we know it might date back to the 14th century, when knights and soldiers would extend their unclenched right hands toward each other in greeting to show that they were carrying no weapons.
   
 These days, it would seem, the potential weapon isn't a knife, but the hand itself. Or rather, its propensity for picking up and holding onto microbes from contaminated surfaces, or from our own eyes or noses when we have certain illnesses. Those germs can then be transferred into the hands of the people we greet, while we can pick up their germs. We then will probably touch our own eyes or noses or mouths, potentially sickening ourselves and restarting the cycle.
   
 Now that a novel coronavirus is spreading faster than Russian election propaganda, our hands are being cast in a new, suspicious light. We're being drilled in handwashing techniques as if we were all second-graders. With liquid hand sanitizers out of stock everywhere, we're being counseled on how to make our own out of alcohol and aloe vera gel. (Sadly, we may soon need a recipe for rubbing alcohol, which is also disappearing from store shelves.) And lately, the internet has been brimming with suggestions for socially acceptable ways to greet each other that don't involve passing viruses along blithely from one person to the next.
   
 Could this be the end of the handshake? Come to think of it, if it weren't such a habit, would we really miss a ritual so often fraught with judgment and calculation? (Too firm? Too limp? How about a hug? Or a nod? )
   
 Last Monday, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer waved off Chancellor Angela Merkel as she held out her hand to him; she laughed and praised him for it, and no one seemed worse off. Also that day, U.S. Surgeon Gen. Jerome Adams demonstrated the elbow bump as a less viral way to pass along friendly greetings; Vice President Mike Pence employed that technique on his visit to Washington state on Thursday.
   
 The tradition of clasped hands isn't the only greeting to undergo new scrutiny. A Maori tribe in New Zealand put the brakes on hongi, the traditional nose-to-nose hello. The French have been advised that the familiar cheek-kissing greeting should be abandoned for now. Maybe people will stop making fun of the Hollywood air kiss, though it's not a huge improvement health-wise.
   
 One goodwill suggestion making the rounds is putting our hands together namaste-style. Another one: jazz hands, up and wiggling. Oh, we hope not. This is starting to make the 1960s peace sign look good.
   
 COVID-19 is a real threat, and we don't take lightly the admonitions from health authorities who are trying to control its spread. We may, indeed, need to keep our hands to ourselves for the time being. But we're not ready to send physical greeting rituals like the handshake into the dustbin of history. Humans crave making a physical connection with friends and often with relative strangers. For now, perhaps, a rueful smile and nod might work as a common acknowledgment of our friendly intentions not to infect or be infected by others.
