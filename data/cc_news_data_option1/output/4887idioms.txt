Since January, when the first infections were reported in the U.S., the nation’s total number of cases has surpassed 13 million. More than 265,000 people have died.
 Fauci said the arrival of vaccines offers a “light at the end of the tunnel.” This coming week, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss a rollout of the vaccine, he said.
 He added that President-elect Joe Biden should focus on distributing vaccines in an “efficient and equitable way.” Fauci also said he planned to push the new administration for a rigorous testing program.
 “We’ve got to go beyond the symptomatic people and get a better understanding of the asymptomatic transmission,” he said.

"I never considered myself somebody who's in a high-risk category," said the 34-year-old Boston-area college administrator and adjunct history professor. "But I just know that for a couple of days, I was really, really anxious about this test. I didn't know if I should be behaving differently based on it."
 Within days, a confirmatory test showed Albanese did not actually have the potentially severe yet curable liver infection. Still, the memory of that false positive result gave him a new perspective on testing writ large. He had been skeptical of recommendations shifting breast cancer screening to older ages to reduce the psychological toll of false positives, but he said they made more sense after his own testing drama.
 "'Isn't it better to do the screening regardless?'" he said he used to think. "Now I realize it is a little more complicated."
 These false positives are especially common for screening tests like hepatitis C antibody tests and mammograms that look for medical problems in healthy people without symptoms. They are designed to cast a wide net that catches more people with the disease, known as the test's sensitivity, but also risks catching some without it, which lowers what is known as the test's specificity.
 Though some degree of uncertainty is inherent in all medical decisions, clinicians often fail to share this with patients because it's complicated to explain and unsettling and leaves doctors vulnerable to seeming uninformed, Korenstein said. What's more, doctors are trained to seek definitive answers and can themselves struggle to think in probabilities.
 "High-tech diagnostic testing has led to this mirage of certainty," Korenstein said. "Back in the day before there were MRIs and whatnot, I think doctors were more cognizant of how often they were uncertain."

The Bairns find themselves in League One these days but had plenty of top- flight experience with the likes of Blair Alston – who was part of the Hamilton side who became the last Scottish team to defeat Rangers in March – Paul Dixon, Sean Kelly, Morgaro Gomis and Connor Sammon in their line-up.
 Mark Durnan is another who has tasted life in the Premiership but it was schoolboy stuff from the former Dundee United centre-back as he allowed Goldson’s 40-yard pass to sail over his head and find Defoe six minutes in.
 The angle looked to be against the 38-year-old as he allowed the ball to run across his chest but he still managed to find a route past Falkirk keeper Peter Morrison, arrowing the ball in off the far post.
 It was a stunning finish but his next attempt sailed wide as the former England poacher volleyed wide from Cedric Itten’s knockdown.
 Gers lost Brandon Barker to injury midway through the first half but the introduction of Glen Kamara only made them stronger and they doubled their lead after 30 minutes.
 Tavernier had forced Morrison into conceding a corner as he took aim from the right-hand side of the box. The keeper got hands on the ball again as Itten met Barisic’s delivery but pushed it straight to Bassey, who rammed home from three yards out.
 To credit Falkirk co-managers David McCracken and Lee Miller, their team showed more intent than many of the sides Rangers have faced this term – and they almost pulled a goal back when Durnan climbed above Bassey to meet Alston’s corner but Jon McLaughlin was untroubled as he pushed the ball behind.
 And it was game over on 42 minutes. Gomis’ trip on Itten handed Barisic a set- piece opportunity which the Croatian executed to perfection as he whipped the ball over the wall and past Morrison’s fingertips for Rangers’ third goal.

As international concern over the crisis grew, a swift victory was what Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was hoping for. But the jubilation stemming from battlefield triumph –the capture of Mekelle -- is likely to be short-lived, according to regional analysts. They believe Saturday’s victory is unlikely to bring Mr Ahmed the results he sought, in part because of lingering ethnic divisions and fragile economic growth following the Covid-19 crisis.

This editorial was published by the Tri-City Herald of Kennewick.
 ———
 With COVID-19 cases hitting record high levels in the community, the last thing we need is for weary Tri-Citians to think they have local officials’ permission to break social distancing rules.
 Unfortunately, the reaction by some Tri-City leaders rallying against Gov. Jay Inslee’s latest set of restrictions risks sending just such a message.
 Richland City Councilor Bob Thompson said during a Nov. 17 council meeting that he doesn’t believe masks or social distancing curb the spread of the disease. He also said he feels happy COVID-19 case numbers are going up because the increase will lead to “herd immunity.”
 Franklin County Commissioner Clint Didier reiterated this week that he would like to see Franklin County open up in defiance of the governor’s orders, and this time he said he would like to get other eastern Washington counties to join the effort.
 Kennewick City Councilor Brad Beauchamp said, “The public is getting pretty tired of getting preached down to,” and he urged the council to “trust our citizens.”
 We know there are many Tri-Citians who agree with these sentiments, but if you want to see how relaxed COVID strategies really work out, look no further than to Idaho.
 The Gem State is a mess.
 Idaho has had one of the most lax COVID strategies in the country, with few restrictions and no mask mandate. For months the state simply trusted its citizens to be responsible.
 Now, Idaho health officials are projecting a crisis in December. Hospitals there are getting maxed to capacity.
 Idaho health care experts say if the spread of COVID-19 continues, then hospital staff may be forced to make decisions about who gets medical care and who doesn’t, according to the Idaho Statesman.
 No doctor should be put in a position of making such a devastating choice. Who gets a hospital bed? Who gets turned away?
 If hospitals take in too many COVID-19 patients, there won’t be beds, equipment and staff enough to handle other emergencies. At some point, instead of admitting all those in need of treatment, some people could be refused because they were deemed too old or too sick.
 This tragic situation is what Inslee has been trying to avoid.
 So far, hospitals in Washington state are managing, but if we don’t slow the spread of the virus, our state’s doctors eventually could find themselves in a similar situation as their colleagues in Idaho. And we already were close to it earlier this year.
 It would be wonderful if enough people voluntarily did their part to slow the spread of disease, but sadly, Idaho’s situation shows that strategy does not work.
 Idaho has the fifth highest rate of positive COVID-19 test results in the country, including Puerto Rico, according to John Hopkins University. Currently, Washington state ranks 35th.
 When it came to masks, Gov. Brad Little threw up his hands because he didn’t think a state order would make a difference, according to the Lewiston Tribune.
 Some local elected leaders in Idaho have tried to impose mask mandates and it hasn’t worked. COVID deniers in Twin Falls, for example, “browbeat” the city council into tabling its mask mandate, the Tribune reported.
 In the Tri-Cities, people didn’t start wearing masks until businesses required it last summer. After that, our COVID-19 case numbers finally started to drop.
 But now they are surging, and our local health leaders are pleading with the community to skip large gatherings for Thanksgiving and isolate as much as possible.
 Inslee’s latest restrictions forbidding inside dining at restaurants, closing gyms and movie theaters and limiting businesses to 25 percent capacity hurts. Small business owners and employees who have already sacrificed financially during the first lockdown are struggling.
 This is a horrible situation.
 But rhetoric that inflames the idea that social distancing and masks don’t work, or that counties should open up, or that people simply should be trusted to do the right thing does not help.
 Too many people in the state of Idaho with these same beliefs have helped to make the pandemic far worse in the Gem State than it needed to be. Tri-Citians should take note.
