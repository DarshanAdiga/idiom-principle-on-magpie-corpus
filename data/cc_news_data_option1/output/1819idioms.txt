Yes. I mean the way I would go through this. And again, we’re working very closely with our customers. Starting with our Biologics facility, I would just say we’re in Biologics drug substance facility in Madison, I would say that we are in good shape. We haven’t yet secured a commercial customer yet in that facility, so that leaves us with some spare capacity plus new capacity that’s going to be coming online with the fourth and fifth train that puts us, I would say, in very good position from an overall drug substance standpoint. On drug product, this is a facility that, quite frankly, we already faced with very heavy demand and in fact the new demand was going to be coming on dovetailing in line with, when we were going to be operating at a capacity level that was, I would say, uncomfortable. But in the current situation, I would just say that we have creatively and aggressively repositioned some of that CapEx to pull it in, including looking at additional CapEx for more capacity, given the significant demand that we have in drug products. But I again, feel that we’re in good position to take not only J&J, but other significant customers from a drug product standpoint. The real – another jewel here is Anagni. Anagni, we brought on board and fundamentally right now we have just BMS as the customer there with the plan over the next two years to build up that book of business with Catalent – other customers for Catalent beyond BMS and it turns out that the capabilities that they have from a drug product standpoint, again, can be, you know aimed toward and positioned for COVID drug product and we’re already in conversations with multiple customers there. So then, again, Catalent is becoming a go-to where we happen to have the right capability and capacity at the right – at the right time. And then, certainly if there is anything that ends up going into a pre-filled syringe format, we have – we have capability and capacity in our Brussels facility. But as you know, John, most of this stuff, given its highly accelerated state will likely be in multi-dose vials, including the J&J, the J&J product that will be in a vial that will probably have somewhere between three and five doses not yet determined. So again, I would just say that Catalent is in a very strong position to address a lot of our customers, but things are; the capacity I had last Friday has changed on Monday, just based on the conversations and things going on with customers. So it’s an exciting time, and again I’m just humbled and thankful that Catalent is going to be able to play a substantial role in being part of the solution for the COVID-19.

And as we're seeing now, a lot more of the trade shows and conferences, there's some great technology out to conduct those. And that also -- if that sticks, and I think it's a little too early to say if that will stick or not, that also could have a resultant reduction in overhead costs associated with those.

Such incidents have pushed blackface back into the spotlight, forcing us to reconsider the nature of the transgression. Is it always wrong or is it only wrong when worn by non-blacks? Should we, as Megyn Kelly suggested, make a distinction between blackface that’s imitative and blackface that’s deliberately insulting? And what of white politicians and performers who, in decades past, chose to darken their skin? In an interview in August, comedian Sarah Silverman revealed that she was fired from a recent movie when the producers happened upon a blackface sketch she did in 2007.2 In the sketch, Silverman applies black makeup to her face to determine whether Jews (Silverman is Jewish) or African Americans face more discrimination. Of course, her experiment goes awry. Rather than attacking her as an African American, passersby attack her as a bigot, taking her choice of makeup as a sign that she wants to mock black people. The message of the bit was hardly pro-blackface, but the producers apparently felt that whatever Silverman’s intentions, she’d crossed a line simply by tinting her skin. Did they make the right call, and if so should others in the industry follow suit? Why does such a seemingly trivial act – the use of a little black or brown face paint – cause so much anguish?

Yes, I think you're spot on. Opengear has really two primary markets, it's a data center and, if you will, cloud-based applications. But increasingly, and actually the faster-growing part of their business has been edge deployments. So those would go out into either retail or other distributed environments. But the data center initiatives have been holding up, and actually, we do expect that to continue, and have seen no signs of it yet. Now, I want to emphasize, it is a low visibility business. This is not the kind of business where you get multi-year purchase orders. So the visibility doesn't extend out for quarters, but all signs are pointing towards continued investments. Especially with so much of us now working from home and leveraging cloud-based infrastructure, those companies are continuing to build out their presence and take advantage. A lot of these customers are certainly not immune to the pandemic, but they're highly confident in their ability to get through this and continue these long-term investments that they want to take advantage of right now while everybody's on the cloud.

Yes. Originally, I think before the pandemic, most in the industry, including ourselves, did expect some capacity tightening as we went through this year. I think, I certain expect that still to be the case. I think the degree to which we will see it actually translate is, let's just say in Q3 and Q4, is going to be more than anything a reflection on how long and deep the downturn is. The deeper and longer that we see a downturn, whether it be a U, V, L, whatever it ends up, the more significant I think you'll see a capacity drop-off, particularly around those that do not have the liquidity to weather the storm. And I also would say, it's interesting in our competitive landscape, the more specialized, in particular, our segment, that more specialized area, many of our competitors are fairly small. And many times they are tied to 1 industry vertical predominantly or maybe just a couple of customers. Back to the strength of the diversity of our model, yes, we're specialized, but we have an ability to share capacity. And that's an exciting thing I've seen in the last, say 30 to 60 days, more than ever, our team of leaders have pulled together and have responded and shared information or sharing capacity to help weather this storm. That's something that our competitors don't have. They don't have a sister company they can lean to and look for help and share with each other as we do.

And yet, in so far as what was known at the time, he wasn’t wrong. From a certain perspective, scientists arguing that the earth had to be hundreds of millions of years old had no better explanation for the sun than Thomson had for people who furnished arguments in favor of the age of the earth. The disciplines of geology and biology were at loggerheads with physics. In this day and age, it’s easy to point fingers at Thomson and insist that he should have had the sense to yield, but in that time period, he was working with well-established theories of gravitation and heat energy that had held up to scrutiny and which were in use in many different disciplines. Geologists and biologists, on the other hand, were basing their arguments on speculative dating methods that could not, at that time, be verified experimentally.

Well look, I think Dave I’ll answer it briefly and turn it over to Wetteny. But I think you can see from our prepared remarks that there were multiple reasons with regards to Biologics’ EBITDA being down. First of all, we’re on boarding a significant amount of talent both within our Bloomington, as well as our Baltimore Gene Therapy business and then also our Cell Therapy business which when we did the acquisition, we told you that we wouldn’t have meaningful contributions from that business, including Anagni. Those both had impacts both with regards to the EBITDA margin. And then, specifically with regards to the EBITDA, I would say, again, it was the softness of the European drug product and what we mean by that is fundamentally the flu demand that we had there, again increased head count, and then there was also this limited duration non-cell line comparable that we have. And again, I’ll turn it over to Wetteny and see if he wants to get into any more precise details there.

Yes, I’ll actually answer the first – Ricky. I’ll answer the last question first and just say that I do think that there will be some longer-term structural shifts that are going to happen. I think that everybody is rethinking what it means to be a sovereign nation and have the ability to have a safe and secure supply chain. So I think that there will be some longer-term structural changes, but again those are going to take time. I do think that, on a go-forward basis, there is certainly going to be a preference for domestic assets and when I say domestic I mean U.S. and Western European. So this is certainly not something that’s going to be a switch that’s going to be flipped with regards to changing the structure. But I do think that the preference toward domestic assets and a consideration of what is high risk supply chain is going to change over time. Now backing up, with regards to Catalent, I think with regards to specific pressure. First of all, we’ve noted that 80% – I would say that 80% of what Catalent sources directly is non- China, non-India. And that if we are to see any potential disruptions, those would probably be the first couple of – couple of places. And for us that is in the area of some consumer health products, if you will, and that’s where a lot of those APIs are sourced from. But again, we have a very strong beat in signals on that and are proactively going out to increase our overall safety stocks. A lot of – also a lot of the, I would say the APIs that are again, sourced from those areas of the world are for generics, of which – that’s a very small portion of the overall Catalent business at about 7%. So again, I think we’re just kind of well-positioned overall from that – from that standpoint. That being said, you know we’re trying to be incredibly proactive across the board and we are increasing our safety stocks. Normally, we are in a mode of somewhere between three and six months and we’ve – are expanding those across our top products and that’s also why I had mentioned that you will likely see a rise in our overall inventory levels, which we believe is the right trade-off right now to make sure that we continue to have the overall continuity of supply. So, there may be some additional bumps in the road. But what we, what we’ve experienced so far and what we have current visibility to believe – we believe that any impacts will be modest and likely offset by a lot of the increasing demand that we’re seeing from a lot of these COVID related projects and hopefully that answered most of your questions Ricky. And if it didn’t, rewind and let me know what else you’d like me to answer.

I am proud to report that the tireless efforts of employees across our company and our strong financial position have together permitted us to continue to meet our commitments to our internal and external stakeholders.

We expect CMS actually to do better this fiscal year than last. We see some margin expansion. As you could tell, we booked the $50 million T2C2 contract towards the end of the quarter. And so that will get shipped out in the second half. There are a number of orders in DTECH that are "in the contracting officer's typewriter" that will get in their short shipment cycles. We're also -- you remember, we won that large tropo order with the Marine Corps in the first quarter, and that is ramping up as well. And then finally, you'll remember we bought Pixia, which is a commercial software company, and they have a few orders that are software licensing kinds of agreements that have very high margin. So net-net, I'm very confident that CMS will -- that this is timing and that CMS will actually have a better year than we did last.

Yes, Rick. That's a really good question. As Jamie mentioned, we do feel that we will continue to generate cash, to continue to be profitable through this pandemic. And so, as you saw in last quarter, we do anticipate our leverage position improving, our cash position improving. So we are still on the offense. We are looking at opportunities. It's a little bit harder to develop, Rick, new opportunities when you're doing it remotely. But we've got a database of opportunities that we've been mining for the last five years. So we're certainly in touch with those opportunities, and we want to take advantage of these things, should they present itself. And I think at this phase, we're early enough that we haven't seen quite as many white flags, if you will, go up in the air. But we want to make sure that we're there in case there's an opportunity to take advantage of.

The book illustrates the deliberate and keen planning that culminated in the Red Sox’s 2018 championship. But it also draws an interesting parallel between the money and hours Epstein and his scouting department spent on signing a plethora of high draft picks before the 2011 deadline and the similar resources Epstein used this winter to overhaul the player development department in order to at least catch up with data-driven major-league heavyweights.
 Recognizing that the collective bargaining agreement was to expire after the 2011 season, Epstein took advantage of rules that gave teams two compensatory draft picks for a premier free agent.

With Chandigarh administration extending quarantine facilities to hotels and schools to deal with mounting cases, residents living close to these facilities are protesting the move. They allege that by setting up isolation facilities in densely populated parts of the sectors, the administration is exposing them to danger.
 Residents of Sectors 10 and 46 have written to the UT administration to mark their protest.
 Recently, the UT administration opted for Hotel Mountview to quarantine patients, while milder and asymptomatic cases will be sent to the Sector-46 Dhanwantari Ayurvedic Hospital. The move has prompted residents of both sectors to point out to the administration that the places are uncomfortably close to residential areas, thus a source of threat to them.
 Hotel Mountview, in Sector 10, is situated in the midst of a residential area. Protesting this, president of the resident welfare association (RWA), Col Kulwinder Singh (retd), has written to UT administration asking them opt for some other hotel for quarantine. "Mountview is in the heart of the sector with houses of senior citizens all around it. The government only wants to make money for CITCO by charging exorbitant rates. What about the safety of residents?" he asked.
 Singh has asked UT adviser Manoj Parida to opt for another hotel or face retaliation from citizens. "We residents will form a chain around Mount View and stop their buses from entering if needed," he said.
 The local area councillor here, Maheshinder Singh Sidhu, said that rather than bring people to a centrally situated hotel, such as The Mountview, the administration could consider using hotels situated in Sector 17, or the Industrial area, or even the outskirts of the city for the safety of residents.
 Residents of Sector 46 also claim a similar problem with Dhanwantari Ayurvedic Hospital in the sector, being chosen as quarantine facility. Situated right next to the busy Sector 46 market and the residential area, the move has not gone down well with residents.
 President of Sector 46-D RWA, Kedarnath Sharma, said, "The hospital is situated adjacent to a temple and a school. A 24/7 supervision may not be possible. Patients may even roam around as they are mostly asymptomatic which is a cause of worry to residents." He also said that a quarantine facility had been set up at Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 46-D on Saturday which provoked a sense of panic. He said he had written to administration officials about the unsuitability of both places.
 The local area councillor here, Gurpreet Singh, said, "The city doesn't have many hospitals, and I agreed with the administration after being assured that all precautions would be taken. I had even recorded a video for residents to pacify them. However, making a Covid quarantine in Sector 46-D government school is a bad idea as it is a crowded area. I have reached out to the deputy commissioner (DC) and the local MP as well, asking them to reconsider and opt for a building on the outskirts of the sector or another sector for this."

Turning to Slide 15. As previously announced in March, we recently strengthened our financial flexibility by entering into a new $450 million unsecured term loan and by upsizing our existing revolver from $800 million to $850 million. Part of the proceeds from the new term loan were used for the early prepayment of our outstanding private placement. Our capacity increased by 30% to a total of $1.3 billion, improving our financial flexibility due to more flexible covenants, interest savings and a better debt maturity profile. This extends the average life of our debt by approximately 1.4 years and decreases principal amortization over the next 24 months by approximately $49 million. Additionally, in April, we swapped $550 million of 1-month LIBOR to a 74 basis points fixed rate, increasing the expected interest savings.

I am proud that Catalent’s committed employees have kept our facilities open and our quality intact. However, the situation remains fluid and I want to be clear that we will not continue to keep a site or production line up and running if we think it isn’t safe for our employees or will negatively impact quality. Managing our supply chain is another critical component of maintaining business continuity. We continue to stress tests and survey deep into our supply chain to mitigate risks. To-date, we have not identified any significant delay that may have a substantial effect on the delivery of any product or clinical trial supplies or that may impact our development services. We’ve adopted specific procedures to minimize and manage future disruption to our ongoing operations including expanding our safety stock of raw materials and securing personal protective equipment across our network as well as ongoing monitoring of our supplier stock levels to mitigate impact on future deliveries. Note that our inventory levels will likely rise as a result of our proactive actions to secure safety stock for longer than normal periods. We have successfully navigated supply chain in other COVID related complexities thus far, and our proactive and continuing efforts position us for continued success. However, the supply chain for our customer’s products is dynamic and fluid so we will continue to focus on proactively identifying and resolving any global logistical challenge and there may be unforeseen challenges ahead.

Sure. So, Dan, I’ll just first speak at a high level. So first of all, Catalent was extremely proactive in our COVID response, really having our teams up and running full starting in February. And so I would say, the company has already been operating over the net – over the last 2.5 months to 3 months in, I would say, this new way with about 25% of our employees working from home and about 75% of our employees going in. All of our sites are operational. Our number one priority is keeping our employees safe and that’s why we’ve been able to have the confidence in the resilience of our employees to be able to come in to work and continue to do the important work for Catalent. I would say that, in our prepared remarks, we discussed the fact that you know if we look at some of the headwinds that we face, it’s really around the area of slightly decreased productivity that comes from modestly higher absenteeism levels, some increased costs that we’re incurring due to COVID, including many things that we’re doing from a company benefit standpoint to help out our employees in this – in this unprecedented time. We’re also, as I mentioned in my remarks, will be seeing – like seeing higher inventory levels as we go out and increase our overall safety stocks.

Great. A couple of questions on operations. First off, in terms of the turnaround, you spent $13 million in 2019 on turnarounds. So we'll see that as a savings or as a positive for this year. What about productivity and any overhead absorption that's lost in those turnarounds? Is there additional savings on top of that $13 million that you would see on a comparison?

ICICI Bank’s March-quarter numbers offer us two quick takeaways. One, the COVID-19 uncertainty is developing as the next big risk factor for all banks. In the quarter ended March, ICICI Bank has made a Rs 2,725 crore provision to cover the likely risks from COVID-19 lockdown. Provision refers to the money set aside by banks to cover risky loans.
 During a conference call post the Q4 results release,the ICICI Bank management was cautious in giving guidance on growth. That’s understandable. The management, just like everyone else, is unsure on how the COVID-19 scenario will play out. An uncertain business environment certainly presents risks going ahead not just for banks but all industries.

 The magistrates also approved Friday a number of improvements to the Warren County Regional Jail that will be paid for through Securus capital improvement funds.
 Those funds are provided by a contract with Securus Technologies, which provides video and phone services for inmates, and will not come out of the county's general fund.
 Other items approved include $3,950 for Allen Mansfield to do custom metal work in the visitation booth at the jail; $4,500.17 for B&P Glass to replace windows in the jail's community room; and $14,640 to Cook's Direct for kitchen tray delivery carts.
 Also approved was a contract and memorandum of agreement with the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet for the Warren County Regional Jail to provide services through the Roadside Inmate Work Crew Program. The two-year contract, which begins July 1, calls for a total payment of $310,000 in officer salaries for inmate supervision and $50,000 for inmate labor.
 The magistrates approved two purchases related to the need for improved audio and video equipment brought about by the coronavirus pandemic and resulting need for meetings held via videoconference.
 One item, for $19,988, is for purchase from Red Ranger Media and installation of video and presentation equipment for the fiscal court meeting room.
 The second item, for $25,878, is for purchase from Broadband Business Systems and installation of broadcast and live stream equipment in the county courthouse.
 Also approved was an allocation of $50,000 to United Way's 2-1-1 service for the additional COVID-19 response and communication and added responsibility of pre-registration for COVID-19 testing.

Prior to the discovery of the conservation of energy, it could safely be assumed that the sun simply produced energy out of thin air, so to speak. There was no need to worry about the source of the sun’s energy, since it was not known that energy was conserved and that, therefore, the sun could not produce heat forever.

Another comeback ensued after the 1984 publication of Charles White’s authorized bio “The Life and Times of Little Richard, the Quasar of Rock.” This second renascence was highlighted by a thesping and musical appearance in “Down and Out in Beverly Hills,” director Paul Mazursky’s 1986 adaptation of Jean Renoir’s “Boudu Saved From Drowning.” “Great Gosh A’Mighty,” a rocker in the grand, gospelized Richard manner drawn from the soundtrack, became his last solo chart hit.
 He was born Richard Wayne Penniman in Macon, Ga. The third eldest of a dozen children, he was the son of a church deacon and sometime nightclub operator; his mother was a devout Baptist and sister in the Pentecostal church.
