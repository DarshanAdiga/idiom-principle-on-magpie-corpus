Manchester United are keen to sign Juventus forward Paulo Dybala, write Calciomercato . The Argentina international has fallen down the pecking order at the Allianz Stadium since the arrival of Cristiano Ronaldo last summer. Dybala has been restricted to just 21 starts in Serie A, while he completed 90 minutes in the Champions League on just two occasions. Juventus are therefore willing to cash in on the former Palermo attacker, and United have identified him as a leading transfer target.…

Hear Québec announced in an April 6 statement its partnership with TrashTalk in expanding their Grocery Delivery Program.

 In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the health emergency declared by the Government of Québec on March 13, Hear Québec and TrashTalk are redirecting their efforts to deliver groceries to those in need in the West Island.
 “After volunteering with TrashTalk, I realized that we would be able to reach even more people if we pooled the resources and expertise of both organizations together,” stated Heidy Wager, Executive Director of Hear Québec (formerly known as CHIP). “In times like this it is important to remember that we are all stronger when we work together. For us that means bringing together the efforts of two great not-for-profit organizations to work with community partners like Metro Beaconsfield to offer this service to those most at-risk in our community.”

The coronavirus has changed how Dr. John Okrent practices medicine.
 A family doctor at Sea Mar Community Health in Tacoma, Okrent had never done appointments by phone before. One day last week, with the clinic encouraging patients to stay home and call in, 19 of the 23 patients he tended to were on the phone.
 On site, patients suspected of having the virus are screened and sent to a different entrance, and then to one of two designated rooms. There, they're met by a medical assistant and then by Okrent or another doctor, wearing full gown, gloves, mask and face shield.
 "It's such a strange phenomenon. In my experience as a doctor, so much of what we do is laying hands on people and it's close contact with people and it's being right here for people," said Okrent, who also works at a homeless shelter one day a week. "But coronavirus is the undercurrent of everything right now."
 Okrent, 39, has a way of dealing with this strange phenomenon. He's writing poems about it -- sonnets. Poetry Northwest, the venerable local poetry journal, published the first five last week. Sonnets six through eight were published a few days later.
 One poem for each day, give or take, each one titled with the date. Each sonnet begins with the last line of the previous sonnet, one poem bleeding into the next. A crown of sonnets.
 "It kind of mirrors the experience of our days now," Okrent said. "Everybody is in a similar experience of the days kind of blending in with each other, there’s this repetition."

 Seriously.
 The mind-boggling success of virtual racing over the past month has put motorsports out front in the race to create competition while sports is shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly every series now has regular virtual racing for its competitors and a lot of its on national television — and it's online for fans who prefer to watch that way. Drivers are gaining newfound fame, even sponsorship.
 “I think we are honestly still in the early stages of figuring out how to make this work as good as we can,” said IndyCar driver Conor Daly. “You have four different areas where your brand can build — Twitch, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter … maybe I continue to develop a YouTube channel, who knows? There’s stuff that I think you’ll end up doing during this time that will no matter what help you in the long run, and that’s just what we’re trying to do is when we do go back to racing.
 “Maybe we’ve built a bigger fan base, we’ve built a bigger brand for our sponsors and the people that do support us.”
 All of which would be welcome news for motorsports, which has faded since its heyday amid attendance and sponsorship declines. For now, virtual racing will have to do.

Many who live in the south will never forget April 25, 2011. In my neck of the woods, we lost 80 lives in a 60 mile radius, in the span of a few hours. The property damage was also devastating. Ever since that day, we get nervous if there’s a strong breeze in the forecast. When the wind starts whistling and the trees begin to sway, we head for our safe space. Our survival instinct kicks in.
 We don’t know how long this pandemic will last, nor do we know how it will end. What will “normal” be like a year from now? Will you eagerly reach out and shake someone’s hand? If a good friend rushes in for a hug, will you move forward, or back away? If the man next to you in church sneezes, will you move to a different pew? At what point will you feel comfortable in a crowded theater? It’s much like our first steps. We’re unsteadily moving forward.
 This much I know. Just as firefighters, police officers and EMT’s became heroes to us after 9/11, we are now adding doctors, nurses, and their assistants to that category. We have long thanked our military personnel for their service, as we should. Now, the brave men and women who staff our hospitals and medical offices are on the front lines, working long hours. They’re fighting an unseen enemy, at great risk to themselves and their families. They are in the line of fire, trying to save our lives. In some cases, they are unable to do so, and they will carry that burden forever. We will always salute our heroes in fatigues. Let’s add those in scrubs to the list.
 We must now honor our doctors’ requests to isolate ourselves, to help them help us. Our strong nation must join hands, even when we cannot touch each other.

 On a day the capital recorded 183 new COVID-19 cases -- the highest single-day jump so far -- the Delhi government declared East Delhi's Dilshad Garden "coronavirus-free", saying no new cases have been reported in the area for the past 10 days. Dilshad Garden had been identified as one of 10 hotspots in the country last month. This was after a 38-year-old woman, who had returned to Delhi from Saudi Arabia, tested positive for COVID-19 and was eventually linked to several others, including a mohalla clinic doctor, testing positive.

Teachers are scrambling to find a balance between too much work and not enough. Some are adapting easily, while others are struggling.
 “The best class is English,” Gagnon says. “We’re still learning new things, and [Mrs. Combs-Long] is always on top of emailing us back.”
 Fricke agrees. “Some teachers are fine. It feels like they’re still talking to us.”
 Other classes have been more challenging, and it isn’t hard to see why.
 “Art is difficult,” says an anonymous student, “if only because I don’t have the same resources at home as I do at school. I had to buy my own colored pencils at work.”
 For Bailey, the most noticeable loss is in his math classes.
 “You can’t see how students are doing like you can in a classroom,” he says, observing that many students need to be guided through the material more directly than e-learning currently allows. He also points to culinary and physical education as classes that have obvious problems in translating to the home environment.
 One obstacle looms large over all others for high school seniors, though — their own biological clocks.
 “I typically wake up around 11 every day, and I’ve been staying up late,” says Bailey.
 “I have not woken up earlier than 12 at all,” reports Fricke. “Why can’t I finish my work at 9 o’clock at night?”
 Teachers have expressed dissatisfaction with students turning in assignments late in the night, maintaining that although this may not be the standard school setting, a similar schedule ought to be kept by students.
 North Newton’s students will just have to find a way to cope until May 20th, the last day of e-learning. Ultimately, the problems are manageable. And they’re better than the alternative.
 “I think it’s cool we can stay connected and finish this thing on time, no delays,” says Gonczy, adding that he prefers this to graduating late and possibly even having to postpone college. “I wouldn’t change anything. I was surprised by how easy the transition was.”
 “Three days a week is nice,” says Bailey. “No teacher has overloaded us yet.”
 The top concerns for many students, though, are still the hallmarks of senior year: Graduation. Prom.
 The official word is that graduation ceremonies will be postponed until July, although it’s still unknown what form these ceremonies will take. As for prom, the school has been mum.
 Some students are still holding out hope for prom, while others grow pessimistic.
 “I don’t think we’re doing prom,” says Bailey. “It’s a bummer.” He adds that he expects the senior girls to take the news worst of all. “I’m not heartbroken.”
 “I know girls who have spent more than five hundred dollars on prom dresses already,” says Fricke. She adds that most of those purchases are non- refundable.
 Gagnon is among the students suffering from buyer’s remorse. She mentions that, should prom be officially canceled, her dad will be throwing his own senior prom.
 Other parents have made similar efforts to pick up the pieces of the Class of 2020’s senior year, ranging from a drive-in movie night at the school to a parade through the towns of Morocco, Lake Village, and Roselawn.
 Graduation ceremonies, too, are up in the air, leaving students uneasy.
 “I don’t know what to believe about graduation,” says Fricke. She mentions rumors, ranging from an entirely virtual graduation to one held on North Newton’s football field.
 “It’s one of those things you build your whole life up to,” Bailey says. It’s difficult to imagine graduation ceremonies not taking place in some form or another. Some way, somehow, North Newton’s seniors will be ushered into adult life.
 No senior expected or wanted this, that much is clear. Finishing out the semester has been a struggle, but it’s a struggle that North Newton seniors intend to persevere through. The halls will remain empty, the classrooms will remain silent, but the Class of 2020 will press on, and the war against coronavirus will be won.
 No matter what, senior year will not be forgotten.

Major League Baseball is bracing for a multi-billion dollar hit to its industry this year.
   
 Yet if there's one group that can withstand a financial wallop wrought by the novel coronavirus, it is the game's 30 ownership groups.
   
 Forbes released its annual list of franchise values Thursday and projected that 28 of 30 clubs saw appreciation in 2019, with the New York Yankees once again leading the pack in total value ($5 billion) and appreciation (9%).
   
 Only the Pittsburgh Pirates and Miami Marlins experienced drops, of 1% and 2% respectively, with the Marlins, at $980 million, the only franchise outside the billionaire club. The Kansas City Royals, the only club to change hands last year, with John Sherman buying them for $1 billion, are valued at $1.025 billion.
   
 The overall values aren't surprising in an industry distributing an estimated $10.5 billion in revenues, and its proprietary television and online inventory maintaining high value despite the existential threat to the TV industry. Still, there's a few takeaways we can glean from the values, which are unconfirmed and often rebutted by MLB:
   
 •Why has tanking been such a trend? Consider the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, who share a geographical region and a sports network. The Nationals spent big again and won the World Series. The Orioles saw attendance bottom out at Camden Yards as they intentionally fielded one of the worst teams in their history. Yet both teams' value increased by 9%.
   
 •The Tampa Bay Rays won 96 games, made the American League Championship Series yet experienced virtually flat attendance (an increase of 23,000) as they floated the concept of partial relocation to Montreal. Still, they saw a 4% increase in franchise value, to $1.05 billion, as a new cable deal that doubles in value to $60 million annually kicks in.
   
 •Is on-field success tied to franchise riches? Largely -- six of the top 12 most valuable teams (Yankees, Dodgers, Cardinals, Nationals, Astros, Braves) comprised more than half the 10-team playoff field. Yet, the No. 18 Twins, No. 26 Athletics and No. 28 Rays also made the postseason, a possible testament to their front-office smarts, the value of revenue-sharing or, more likely, the cyclical nature of contention that mid-market teams experience.
   
 MLB's class structure may also determine who emerges from a 2020 campaign wreaked -- or wrecked -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Smaller-market teams are generally more reliant on ticket sales and gameday revenue, which will be slowest to return once the game does as concerns about large gatherings -- or even the ability to gather in public -- loom into 2021.

Everyone responds to change in routine differently, including kids. Most children have had to adapt to learning from home.
 “Monday, Wednesday, and Friday they do a Zoom meeting with the whole class,” Taylar Ridberg explained.
 Ridberg is the mother of two, 6-year-old Makena and 4-year-old Knox.
 “She misses seeing her teacher and her friends,” Ridberg said.
 Like many kids, they went on spring break in March, thinking they’d come back to school, but that’s not what happened.
 “They told us, 'Yup, we are going to be doing virtual school until further notice,'” Ridberg said.
 Learning and working from home was an abrupt shift in lifestyle for some people, including Ridberg’s family. In the eyes of 6-year-old Makena, it may be hard to understand.
 “They know that there’s a virus going on," Ridberg said. "We tell them it’s not something we need to be afraid of, it’s just part of life. Things happen in life."
 “You want to keep things age appropriate,” Dr. Chris Rogers, the Medical Director of Child and Adolescent Services at the Medical Center of Aurora, said. “Things like saying, ‘We're doing what we need to do to keep our family safe,’ is probably very appropriate, but saying things like, ‘Don't worry, no one in our community is gonna get sick,’ is probably not very much a good idea.”
 Dr. Rogers explains the emotions children may be feeling.
 “We’re seeing somewhat of the classic stages of grief manifesting with kids,” he said. “A lot of them were sort of excited, 'yay, no more school,' and then I think it started to settle in that home is not that much fun when it’s all you do all day every day.”
 He said this won’t last forever. The only reasons parents should be concerned and seek professional help is if children have trouble sleeping, or regress on previous milestones or skills they’ve already learned. There are things adults can do to help.
 “Your kids will form their opinion on what's happening by listening to your conversations,” Dr. Rogers said.
 “I think they’re picking up their family's stress. Lots of things like I really miss going outside, I want to see my friends,” Katie Strabala, an elementary school teacher of 15 years, said. Strabala teaches 5th-graders in the Denver, Colorado area.
 “More than ever before, kids are having totally different experiences,” she said.
 “The good news is that kids are resilient; in many ways more so than adults often,” Dr. Rogers said.
 The other good news: people have gotten creative in finding fun. Online, videos of drive through birthday parties and virtual video parties have gotten a lot of attention.
 “She has really gotten into FaceTiming her friends,” Ridberg said about her daughter.
 Many organizations are getting on board with posting virtual tours and experiences for kids, too.
 Another solution?
 “Coming up with creative ways to keep them being able to explore their world even within the same four walls, so to speak,” Dr. Rogers said.
 Dr. Rogers suggested having them help you cook and clean up. Keeping a routine can also help as kids, parents, and teachers readjust.
 “One of the things that has really been helpful for me is these video conferences, my office hours,” Strabala said.
 The response to the pandemic is fluid, and so is how schools are choosing to handle it.
 “It'll be interesting to see if we ever settle into a rhythm,” Strabala said. “At the beginning of all this, we thought what are the next two weeks going to look like. Then, it was what are the next four weeks going to look like, and what are the next eight weeks gonna look like. It just keeps changing, and we don't know.”
 “My hope and expectation is that the vast majority of kids will bounce back and this really won’t negatively impact their development or their social skills or their educational development," said Dr. Rogers. "I think it'll be, hopefully, more of a speed bump than a long term problem."

Amid the sudden change of scenery, faculty and staff at Northeast were well equipped as they transitioned to working remotely from their respective homes. NACC’s ETS department quickly implemented a “grab and go” program, putting computers and printers in the hands of every staff member and student in need. This program created a seamless transition to online instruction, and students continued in their courses without hiccups. Having over 600 computers readily available allowed this program to be successful.
 Educational Technology Support is also equipped with a remote access software, which has proved to be invaluable during this telecommuting period. This tool is used to offer IT support to faculty and staff, as ETS staff can remotely access, manage, and offer technical support to the entire NACC community.
 Using this software to request and receive help remotely has taken the normal technology frustrations that faculty and staff may have had away. ETS can access computers, chat with the individual, and provide immediate assistance to meet the needs of the faculty or staff member or student. This process was streamlined ever further for online instruction. ETS implemented the use of the “Help Me” button to initiate a help request. This notifies ETS staff that someone is waiting online for assistance and hurries the process along.
 The Educational Technology Department also created a new webpage for easy access to online resources. The new Continuity Tools webpage offers countless resources and videos for faculty, staff and students on how to stay connected and troubleshoot any problem imaginable. Students can access tutoring options, Canvas online learning, Respondus Lockdown Browser and more. Faculty and staff can learn how to transfer their office phones, check their voicemail from home, access Office365 apps, and contact the ETS Help Desk with one click.
 The key to NACC’s success in transitioning to online-only instruction and telecommuting is simply being prepared. There was no instruction time lost enrolling students in an online system. One simple training session had all instructors up to speed on how to deliver course content electronically.
 Falk is proud of the way faculty and staff at Northeast have come together to rise to the challenge of this situation.
 “In so many ways, we were ahead of the technology game,” Falk said. “Many schools have no tools to allow face to face meetings with their students. If not for a president like Dr. Campbell that supports the use of new technology, we would not be where we are today.”
 Campbell is especially proud of the Technology Department at Northeast.
 “We (NACC) have the best support system. Working from home may not be ideal, we are making it work as a team,” he said.

From the first trial that resulted in a hung jury, to a sweeping suppression order that set the national media and the courts on a collision course, the Pell case has polarised and transfixed the nation, and in light of the High Court ruling there is now opportunity for reflection.
 ABC editorial policies make very clear that it is the job of the public broadcaster's journalists to report "without fear or favour, even when that might be uncomfortable or unpopular".
 Cardinal George Pell himself told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse: "My own position is that you never disbelieve a complaint. But then it has to be assessed to see just whether it is valid and true and plausible. But the starting point must never be that they are disbelieved, that the allegations are taken very seriously and examined."
 That is what ABC journalists have been doing and will continue to do.

Throughout most of the show, Mae pretends that she has everything under control—that she’s fine—but she’s in denial. There’s a ringing in her ear when she’s faced with one of her addictive vices. It first appears when she kisses George, and then again when she sees her friend do coke. It happens several times throughout the series, and the viewer is always on edge about whether or not Mae will take drugs again.

Raheem Sterling cannot wait for Sunday’s Premier League title decider after the “massive honour” of picking up the Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year award.
 A stunning season with Manchester City and England has been complemented by impressive work off the pitch fighting racism in football and society.
 Sterling’s heroics saw him crowned PFA Young Player of the Year and then voted as the FWA Footballer of the Year, which the 24-year-old picked up at the Landmark Hotel in London on Thursday.
 “It’s a massive achievement, a massive honour,” he said. “To be recognised is always a lovely feeling, especially by the writers. It makes it even more special.
 “It is an award that I will cherish, especially with the people that have won it before me so I am really, really glad and proud.”
 Sterling collected 62 per cent of the poll by FWA members and beat Liverpool centre-back Virgil Van Dijk to the award by over 100 votes.
 He will be hoping to get the better of the Dutchman once again this Sunday, when the most fascinating title race in years goes down to the wire.
 City head to Brighton in the driving seat but Liverpool will be desperate to capitalise on any uncharacteristic slip-up by Pep Guardiola’s men as they welcome Wolves to Anfield.
 “We know how big an occasion it is,” Sterling said. “But I’d much rather be on our side, to know if we win the game, it’s ours.
 “It will be a tough day, that’s for sure. We know Brighton won’t just sit there and let us score goals.
 “They’re safe and it is going to be a really tough day, to be honest with you, but it is one I am really looking forward to.”
 Sterling is the first Manchester City player in 50 years to win the FWA Footballer of the Year award, following on from Tony Book sharing the accolade with Derby’s Dave Mackay.
 ‘Precept and example’ have long been considered when voting for the award – values that Sterling boasts in abundance.
 Put to him that he has had a bit of an up and down time with the media in the recent years, Sterling said: “Yeah, it’s one of those where I take full responsibility as well because it’s my first time being a professional and everyone makes mistakes, especially being young and not quite understanding what goes on in and around football with the media.
 “But as you get older, you mature and understand things much better and I think now people can see me for who I am.
 “Role model, not in terms of saying you set out to be a role model but just in terms of leading by example.
 “You have young kids who do follow you and do look up to you, and you need to try and set the right example for them and the next generation coming through for sure.
 “Certain subjects that I have spoken about this season has been touchy but at the same time I thought it was needed and I tried to do my best to address it in a positive (way) and not come across aggressive or ignorant.”
 Thursday night was a double celebration for City as England striker Nikita Parris collected the FWA Women’s Footballer of the Year.
 “It feels amazing to be voted for by the Football Writers’ Association,” she said.
 “I am really grateful for the award and I hope the night is special, with two Manchester City players getting the award. Many congratulations to Raheem, I think he has been fantastic this year.
 “It has been a fantastic season for us, winning two trophies and will really be fighting for that league trophy next year. It is a fantastic time for women’s football and the England team.”

 It says that the USDA will provide “emergency allotments to households participating in [SNAP]...to address temporary food needs not greater than the applicable maximum monthly allotment for the household size.”
 By instructing the USDA to provide emergency allotments to SNAP households, the act stipulates that the agency must increase benefits to all people in the program, Sanders and others inferred. The only caveat is that the emergency money shouldn’t exceed maximum allotment levels.
 Typically, SNAP benefits are capped according to household size and poverty level: A single person can receive up to $194 a month; for two people, it’s $355; for three, $509; for four, $646. It goes up to families of eight, whose caps are $1,018. Families bigger than that can add $146 per person. Under the new law, for instance, a family of three getting $200 a month in SNAP benefits will receive a bump to the maximum $509 for each of two months.

 Major League Baseball is bracing for a multi-billion dollar hit to its industry this year.
 Yet if there's one group that can withstand a financial wallop wrought by the novel coronavirus, it is the game's 30 ownership groups.
 Forbes released its annual list of franchise values Thursday and projected that 28 of 30 clubs saw appreciation in 2019, with the New York Yankees once again leading the pack in total value ($5 billion) and appreciation (9%).
 Only the Pittsburgh Pirates and Miami Marlins experienced drops, of 1% and 2% respectively, with the Marlins, at $980 million, the only franchise outside the billionaire club. The Kansas City Royals, the only club to change hands last year, with John Sherman buying them for $1 billion, are valued at $1.025 billion.
 The overall values aren't surprising in an industry distributing an estimated $10.5 billion in revenues, and its proprietary television and online inventory maintaining high value despite the existential threat to the TV industry. Still, there's a few takeaways we can glean from the values, which are unconfirmed and often rebutted by MLB:
 •Why has tanking been such a trend? Consider the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles, who share a geographical region and a sports network. The Nationals spent big again and won the World Series. The Orioles saw attendance bottom out at Camden Yards as they intentionally fielded one of the worst teams in their history. Yet both teams' value increased by 9%.
 •The Tampa Bay Rays won 96 games, made the American League Championship Series yet experienced virtually flat attendance (an increase of 23,000) as they floated the concept of partial relocation to Montreal. Still, they saw a 4% increase in franchise value, to $1.05 billion, as a new cable deal that doubles in value to $60 million annually kicks in.
 •Is on-field success tied to franchise riches? Largely -- six of the top 12 most valuable teams (Yankees, Dodgers, Cardinals, Nationals, Astros, Braves) comprised more than half the 10-team playoff field. Yet, the No. 18 Twins, No. 26 Athletics and No. 28 Rays also made the postseason, a possible testament to their front-office smarts, the value of revenue-sharing or, more likely, the cyclical nature of contention that mid-market teams experience.
 MLB's class structure may also determine who emerges from a 2020 campaign wreaked -- or wrecked -- by the COVID-19 pandemic. Smaller-market teams are generally more reliant on ticket sales and gameday revenue, which will be slowest to return once the game does as concerns about large gatherings -- or even the ability to gather in public -- loom into 2021.

“These are horrible, tragic times with the coronavirus pandemic occurring,” he stated. “Our faculty and staff are using our educational technology to provide a quality education for our students during these very trying times. Our educational technology support staff has really kept us going in this effort. I commend everyone’s leadership and dedication to helping our students.”
 Thanks to the leadership and foresight of Campbell, Northeast’s Educational Technology Support Department (ETS) has been equipped with the necessary tools for online-only instruction for quite some time.
 According to Director of Educational Technology Patricia Falk, “We are always using the best technology at NACC!”
 Technology resources at NACC are second to none. The Learning Management System (LMS) allows instructors to hold virtual classes much in the same manner as their face to face classes. Instructors can create video lectures with or without quizzes using a tool called Canvas Studio. Students can submit all work online as well. NACC also offers secure online exams using proctoring tools like Respondus, Lockdown Browser with Monitor, and Proctorio for students with Chromebooks.
 Northeast also licenses Microsoft Office 365, making it available for free to all NACC faculty, staff, and students. Within the Office365 package, there are numerous tools available including Teams, SharePoint, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and more. Although this feature was in place before the COVID-19 outbreak, faculty, staff and students are using it now more than ever.
 Technology Learning Center Director Judith Lea spoke to NACC’s readiness, saying, “I feel we were very prepared and have made very little modification to what we were doing. Students and faculty have always had access to Office365. During the transition we were able to integrate Microsoft Teams directly into Canvas allowing instructors to hold a team meeting (virtual class) by creating a link for students. We have used this transition to bring all instructors on board to the many great technologies we have at NACC.”
 Resources like Microsoft Teams have allowed faculty and staff to stay connected during this telecommuting time. Departments and administrators have been able to have staff meetings to share updates, collaborate on different issues, and have some social enjoyment seeing each other through the video chat portal.

This increase will help those workers laid off or unable to work due to the virus pay bills and make ends meet, replacing most, if not all, of their lost wages in the near term. The bill also lengthens the time an unemployed worker can receive regular benefits from the current maximum to 26 weeks to 39 weeks, but that extension doesn’t include the additional $600 per week.
