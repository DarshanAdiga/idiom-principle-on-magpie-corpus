The Florence-based outfit sealed top spot in Group K with one match to spare, after winning 2-1 away at Guingamp despite playing the second half with 10 men.
 Marko Marin and Khouma Babacar goals inside 13 minutes had Montella's side clear but Jose Basanta's dismissal and Claudio Beauvue's penalty changed the game on the stroke of half-time.
 However, Fiorentina's undermanned side made it four wins in five European matches this term, with Montella particularly pleased with their hot start in Guingamp - along with their composure in the second 45 minutes.
 "It was a great start, playing with great pace and intensity. I saw an almost perfect team, including in their approach to the game," Montella told a news conference.
 "We lowered the tempo, thinking the game was already finished at 2-0 but the penalty and red card changed the game.
 "In the second half we suffered under pressure but in reality allowed few clear-cut chances. The team has acquired an impressive mentality on the European stage and that can only be pleasing.
 "It is also important to have won the group early."

Quarantine has caused my family to be more deliberate in contact and communication. We are talking and face timing daily. I am loving the connection, and I’m determined to continue the deliberateness of talking and expressing our love daily, face to face.


  Quarantine has helped me be of service. I truly cannot keep up with the positive email I’m receiving from readers wishing to talk about a column and express their opinion. I think positive content in this, and all newspapers, has never been more important than now. To remain optimistic during a pandemic will help us all weather the storm, survive and once again thrive as it passes. And believe me, this too shall pass.


  My prayer for us all is that we remain positive and optimistic during the worst of times. In doing so, we’ll usher back into our world, and our lives, the best of times.


  I hope and pray that we all use this time to accomplish the things we previously wished we’d have had the time to accomplish and enjoy.


  Do not squander this precious opportunity with partisan bickering and complaining. Never in my lifetime of more than six decades, has it been more important to reach across the political aisle and work in unison to save lives and recover quickly from the impact of this terrible disease. Partisanship in this time of turmoil only guarantees prolonged misery and suffering.


  Optimism is a powerful choice in times when being optimistic is most difficult.


  Purposefully looking for positive ways to be encouraging during times of mass discouragement is not just helpful but is an honorable calling.


  Choose optimism. Act positively in thought, word and deed. Make the best of a bad situation and we may look back at this time in history and say we virtually held hands and together, we positively weathered the storm. And when the dark clouds break and the sun once again rushes in, our attitude in the worst of times will make us better people.

In addition to some preclinical evidence, Treon had come to believe that his work on the toll receptor pathway in Waldestrom’s might be relevant because this class of proteins, which is connected to BTK, can trigger the cytokine storm. The idea is to reduce the immune system response by blocking BTK.

Slave labor was a regular topic in business correspondence. “The private letters were not entirely concerned with the welfare of the black folks,” Tsapina said. “If they are mentioned, it’s because they misbehave or run away.”


  In one 1853 letter, Shrewsbury complains to Dickinson about a black woman named Mary, calling her “spoilt.” “If she cannot be made to know she is a Negroe & try to help herself,” Shrewsbury wrote, “she better die than to be the cause of 2 or more Negroes spoilt & run away.”


  Hundreds of other letters and documents around slavery, including plans for slave hunts and inventories of slaves owned or hired by Dickinson & Shrewsbury, are part of the collection. One of the few printed documents is a runaway broadside signed by Shrewsbury offering $100 for “a bright mulatto man named William.”


  Seeing just a couple of the documents was a surreal experience for Bruns, who with Payne first learned of the Huntington acquisition from The Times. During a recent interview, both were practically motionless as they studied the documents.


  “It’s not something you want to know about your ancestors, but I guess that was the reality of the time,” Bruns said. “They were slaveholders and they were treated like property, not like human beings. It was disturbing.”


  Inside the company’s shop, visitors can sample salt in flavors like wild onion and smoked bourbon barrel and purchase 1-pound bags for $28. There is no acknowledgment of the slavery that sustained the family business in the 1800s.


  Bruns said a poster recognizing slave labor is in the old office building, where tour groups stop to learn more about the company’s history. The website includes a line on its history page timeline — in the 1830s, “most of the workers are slaves,” it says. Bruns also wrote a blog post acknowledging slavery in 2014.


  In the company’s early days, she faced criticism for not acknowledging slavery in marketing materials.

Brighton chairman Tony Bloom fears English football will pay a heavy price as a result of the coronavirus-enforced shutdown unless the sport's key stakeholders unite.
 The Premier League and the three divisions below it are all suspended indefinitely as Britain remains on lockdown.
 With clubs losing revenue but still having to pay their players' wages, there is growing concern that some will go bust before football finally returns.
 Premier League club Brighton are bankrolled by the wealthy Bloom, but with 2018-19 figures showing £21 million in losses and 71 percent of their annual turnover spent on player salaries, they may not be immune to the crisis.
 Bloom admits there are questions over the sustainability of such a model.
 "After this situation is resolved -- and hopefully that doesn't take too long -- I do think football will come together because right now lots of clubs are at risk of going bust," Bloom said during a conference call on Thursday.
 "We were all devastated when Bury went (expelled from the Football League) because we know how key clubs are to their communities and it's a big concern going forward that more clubs in this country and in others will fold.
 "It does need to be looked at all levels. It really isn't sustainable and it needs something like this crisis to get across some significant change."
 Football has come under fire from politicians and fans over players' slow progress in agreeing to take pay cuts to ease the financial burden.
 Talks involving the Premier League, the Football League, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) and players have so far produced little but several clubs have opted to reverse their highly unpopular decisions to furlough non-playing staff.
 \- 'Wider picture' -
 The PFA's combative stance has infuriated some and Bloom says they should look beyond protecting player wages in the short term because clubs could go out of business, leaving fewer employers.
 "I think it's time for the PFA to step up and look at the wider picture," he said.
 "There are players with contracts running out soon but also younger players who don't have contracts right now, and players lower down the leagues. A lot of those clubs literally won't have money to pay wages in a month or two.
 "The last thing we need is for so many clubs to go into administration and maybe not get out of it. There is a wider picture here and the PFA has a wider responsibility."
 Premier League clubs are due to meet on Friday to discuss the next steps, with reports emerging that a growing number are calling for the season to be ended no later than June 30.
 Declaring the season over would suit Brighton, who are sitting two points above the Premier League relegation zone with nine games left.
 "We would like to finish the season," he said. "There does come a point when we can't keep waiting but I don't think June 30 is that point," Bloom said.
 "There's talk about player contracts and sponsorship and it's difficult to play beyond that but this situation is so unique and unprecedented every option should be looked at."
 Brighton's chief executive Paul Barber warned games may need to be played behind closed doors for an extended period when football is able to resume.
 "If we have to play behind closed doors we have to accept we won't have the same product but equally we have got to accept it might go on for some time," Barber said.

My wife and I attended a live performance of “The King and I” many years ago.


  As a rule, I am a beer and brats guy at the ball park instead of wine and cheese at the theater. I must admit, however, that it was a very special evening.


  The venue was good, the play was excellent, and Yul Brenner was, naturally, the King. It is a role he performed from 1951 to 1985 and will always be associated with. Ironically, the young lady that played Anna was not even born when he first starred in the musical.


  At some point he is being tutored by Anna on the world outside of Siam. He can’t comprehend some things he is being told and shows his frustration in song. He sings “A Puzzlement”. I instantly became fascinated with the word, and use it often. For some unknown reason the occasion pops up a lot.


  During this past winter I had occasion to have two puzzlements. Our HVAC went out and we went several days shivering while waiting for a part. I had to wonder why it always fails in the cold of winter or heat of summer. Why does it never go out in the spring or fall?


  It also troubled me as to why 62° is comfortable outdoors but not indoors. Shorts and short sleeves are the order of the day outside, but inside I am bundled up like little brother Randy on his way to school in “A Christmas Story”.


  I think the difference between puzzlement and a dilemma is their importance. A dilemma is “Do I make the repairs on my old car or do I buy a new one? A puzzlement would be “Why do they sell hot dogs in packs of ten and buns in packs of eight?”

Polish lawmakers voted on Thursday to kick a citizens' bill proposing a toughening of Poland's already tight rules on abortion down the road by sending it to a parliamentary commission for study.
 Abortion is highly divisive in staunchly Catholic Poland, but the bill came at a time when the political focus was on a presidential election due next month. "Those PiS lawmakers who think we can wait ... that we should debate for longer about whether we can kill children or not. Remember those names well," tweeted the Life and Family Foundation, which proposed the bill.
 Religious conservatives are key to the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party's (PiS) support and it is keen to retain their backing despite considerable public opposition to tightening the rules. The bill would ban abortion in one of the few instances in which it is allowed - where prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the foetus.
 Other preconditions are incest, rape and risks to maternal health, but rights campaigners say the bill would eliminate 98% of the small number of abortions carried out in Poland. EXTENDING PRESIDENT'S TERM
 Meanwhile, members of the governing coalition sought opposition support for a two-year extension of President Andrzej Duda's term because of the difficulty of holding an election as planned on May 10 under coronavirus restrictions. PiS had advocated a postal ballot, but late on Wednesday unexpectedly presented a bill to keep Duda in office for now.
 As a constitutional change, this would require opposition backing to secure the necessary two-thirds approval. Junior coalition partner Accord had lobbied for the change and Jaroslaw Gowin of Accord had quit as a deputy prime minister over the issue.
 "We are going to persuade all lawmakers that the historical moment and the huge scale of responsibility held by politicians ... requires us to rise above individual interests," Gowin told reporters. Jan Grabiec of the opposition centrist Civic Platform said Duda could be kept on without such a drastic measure.
 "We believe that in the constitution there are (already) means of postponing the elections," he said. "A state of emergency extends the president's term." Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki was also expected on Thursday to announce an easing of the coronavirus lockdown.
 In March, Poland closed its borders, schools and other public places and largely forbade people to leave their homes. It has so far recorded 7,771 coronavirus infections and 292 deaths. "Final decisions will be taken today. I think that first, starting from Monday, we can expect an opening of forests, green areas," Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin told the private radio station RMF.

Periods of adversity have been a hallmark of human existence. Wars, natural disasters, and past pandemics have shown that our lifetimes are rarely without challenge.


  Yet it is in those challenges that we define our humanity. Such is the case with the COVID-19 pandemic. With so many unpredictable variables, these uncharted waters are being navigated literally hour by hour. A true damned if you do and damned if you don’t scenario for our leaders.


  How do we respond to this threat? At present, we are trying to mitigate the effects of this contagion on billions of people while at the same time trying to prevent a self-induced global economic collapse. In the United States, we have partially shuttered the greatest economy in the world.


  In Congress, we have now passed three specific pieces of legislation purposed to fight the effects of COVID-19 on this nation, the last of which, the $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security, or CARES, Act, was meant to stabilize the economy while we ride out this crisis.


  The CARES Act is not a stimulus package but rather a stabilization measure designed to keep businesses financially viable so that, when we do get through this crisis, and we will, we have an intact structure to restart the economy.


  This leaves the most difficult questions. At what point do we take our foot off the brake and let the economy come back? What does the other side of the curve look like? Poverty, as a social determinant, is known to be a leading cause of death.


  Many are not seeking routine medical care they should be. As we push in one side of the balloon, the other side bulges, which may lead to an increase in deaths due to untreated mental health disorders, nascent cancers, and heart disease.


  We have now worked to flatten the curve not only to save lives but also to buy time for our hospitals to gather resources. So, what should the future look like?

Causeway Capital Management, in a report of its own, said it used big data to help forecast the outcome of the 2019 parliamentary elections in India by hiring local people to classify 10,000 Twitter messages. That effort trained a machine-learning model that then did the same with many more tweets. Causeway said the exercise allowed it to anticipate a better-than-expected showing for the ruling coalition. Indian stocks shot up after the election, far outperforming emerging markets generally.


  Causeway has also predicted stock price movements through so-called nowcasting: generating real-time statistics of one sort or another. By buying data from a vendor that tracked the use of apps on 1.3 billion Chinese phones, for instance, Causeway said it was able to gauge how popular the companies behind each app were and how their stocks were likely to perform.


  “The sheer diversity of data is much larger than before,” said Jeff Shen, co- head of systematic active equity at BlackRock, which uses big data to analyze earnings reports and analyst calls, and study online search patterns relevant to certain businesses.


  “Using new data sources allows us to predict macrotrends or future cash flows of companies better” than conventional research methods, Shen said. “It allows us to ask better questions we had not thought about asking.”

For human beings, "stink flirting" may not sound like a prudent dating strategy. For ring-tailed lemurs, it is the way to go.


  Scientists on Thursday described the results of a comprehensive study of this behavior - unique in the animal kingdom - that is exhibited by these primates native to Madagascar. Male ring-tailed lemurs increase their attractiveness to females by secreting from glands on their wrists a fruity and floral aroma smelling similar to a pear, the researchers said.


  The behavior dubbed "stink flirting" involves a male rubbing a fragrant clear liquid that oozes from those glands against his long fluffy tail and then waving the tail at females. The researchers pinpointed three compounds responsible for the scent. "It turns out that the key odorants were not really stinky," said University of Tokyo biochemistry professor Kazushige Touhara, who led the study published in the journal Current Biology.


  "We can say that the identified odors are strong candidates for sex pheromones," Touhara said, referring to chemical substances released by an animal that affects the behavior of other members of its species. Until now, no pheromones have been identified in any primates, a group that also includes monkeys, apes and people, Touhara said.


  "Although there are many circumstances in which humans utilize olfactory cues for communication, there is no authentic pheromone that has been chemically identified," Touhara said. "I believe there is no classic sex pheromone in humans that elicits attractive behavior to the opposite sex. But there are probably crucial odors that affect each other's emotions - for example, a baby's head smell that parents sniff and feel happy, and a woman's axillary (underarm) odors that affect the emotions of males."


  Olfactory communication is important for ring-tailed lemurs, which possess well-developed scent glands on their wrists and shoulders that they use to mark territory and designate social rank in addition to romance. Among primates, lemurs are part of a separate evolutionary lineage with a keener sense of smell than the group that spans monkeys, apes and humans.


  The researchers found a close relationship between the male hormone testosterone and the lemur odor compounds. They also found that the male scent worked its magic only during the breeding season when females were sexually receptive, as measured by the amount of time spent sniffing the scent during lab experiments. Outside of the breeding season, the researchers found, the male gland secretions smelled different - more bitter and leathery. The females, the researchers found, showed scant interest in that.

Continuing its dialogue with various stakeholders, the sports ministry on Thursday held a meeting with 11 more National Sports Federations (NSFs) and discussed their future plans, keeping in mind the Tokyo Olympics and beyond. The meeting, held throught video conference, was the most recent of a series of dialogues planned by the ministry with various NSFs amid the coronavirus- forced national lockdown.


  The ministry had already interacted through a video conference with officials of Hockey India, National Rifle Association of India and Wrestling Federation of India, among others. "These are routine meetings between the ministry and the NSFs which are now held via video conference because of the pandemic. We already had the first series of meeting with some federations last week and today's one is a continuation of this initiative," a ministry official told PTI.


  During Thursday's meeting, Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya held discussions with two officials each from the national federations of handball, tennis, squash, basketball, Special Olympics Bharat, volleyball, wushu, yachting, kayaking and canoeing, kabaddi and All India University (AIU). "We had already had a discussion with 15 NSFs earlier and today we carried on the process and interacted with 11 more NSFs," Julaniya told PTI.


  "We had normal discussions on their (NSFs) future plans and ACTC (Annual Calendar for Training and Competitions)." An NSF representative, who attended the meeting with Julaniya, said the ministry took stock of their future planning now that Olympics have been delayed. "Every NSF was also asked about their expectations from the next Asian Games. The preparations and target for 2024 and 2028 Olympics also came up for discussion," he said.


  The official also said that the ministry asked the NSFs to work towards developing a training programme for coaches and creating centres of excellence for their respective sports. Meanwhile, with an aim to upgrade the knowledge of coaches across the country in all leading disciplines, the Sports Authority of India (SAI) also started a massive programme online on Thursday, in association with NSFs. SAI coaches, coaches of SAI accredited sports academies, recommended by NSFs and state governments from all over the country will attend these sessions to be addressed by Dronacharya awardees, Arjuna awardees, Khel Ratna awardees, eminent Indian coaches and foreign experts.


  On the opening day, more than 4700 coaches, including former athletes-turned coaches attended the sessions in archery, swimming, football, taekwondo, cycling, fencing, weightlifting, wrestling, judo, volleyball, gymnastics, table tennis, athletics, boxing and sports science. Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister and Archery association of India president Arjun Munda addressed the coaches. "Skill upgradation is a very important aspect of coaching. This initiative will ensure that coaches learn from the best minds of their discipline and they can implement the learnings from these sessions for better results while training athletes," Rijijiu said. The extensive online coach development programme called MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) is an intensive 21-day programme designed for coaches at all levels. The programme is open to 100 coaches at a time for any given session, allowing High Performance Directors to assess each participants individual needs and interests to create a customised learning experience. On the first day eminent coaches including Sanjeeva Singh of archery, Kamlesh Mehta of table tennis and Partha Pratim Majumder of swimming conducted the sessions. Hockey sessions will start from April 20. Each session will have three components -- a 20-minute lecture, 20-minute demonstration with video link and a 20-minute interaction with a view to generate more interest and to promote participation. External evaluators will monitor the sessions regularly and will provide constant feedback, analysis and suggestions for improvement..

UEFA will hold an Executive Committee meeting by videoconference next Thursday, April 23, European football's governing body has confirmed, as it continues to look at ways of restarting the season in the midst of the coronavirus crisis. Before that, the heads of each of UEFA's 55 member associations will come together next Tuesday to look at developments across both domestic and continental competitions. UEFA is also set to meet with the powerful European Club Association (ECA) and the European Leagues grouping on Wednesday.


  The meetings could bring confirmation of the postponement of the next women's European Championship by a year to 2022 -- following the earlier decision to postpone the men's Euro to 2021 -- but any other firm decisions may be unlikely. All leading leagues across Europe, as well as the UEFA Champions League and Europa League, were halted in mid-March as countries went into lockdown due to the pandemic. The only country that has kept on playing is Belarus.


  UEFA has since remained optimistic about the prospect of finishing the European seasons and has been working on the possibility of playing in July and August if need be. The German Football League (DFL) is also set to meet on April 23 to discuss next steps, and is determined to finish the season, with matches behind closed doors, by June 30 to ensure its clubs do not lose out on crucial TV rights revenue. Most teams have resumed training in small groups.


  Belgium earlier stated its intention to bring an early end to the season, but UEFA responded to their announcement by warning that clubs risk being excluded from European competition next season if their leagues unilaterally decide to declare campaigns over. On Wednesday, Scotland announced an early end to the season in the three leagues below the Premiership, with current league leaders declared champions.


  The resolution also allows the ruling SPFL board to call the Premiership as it stands -- Celtic are top -- if it determines the remaining games cannot be played, but they will be waiting for further guidance from UEFA. AFP BS BS.

The sample and the probe were slowly moved, together, in small steps, beginning at 50 nanometers until they were touching.  The temperature of the tip was measured at regular distances (gaps) between 2 nm and 50 nm. The cause of the rapid heat transfer, the researchers discovered, was the result of an overlap of the two sides’ surfaces, and evanescent waves, both of which carry heat.

Most nurseries will tote your purchases to the parking lot or curb, but some of the smaller ones may ask you to do the final loading into your vehicle yourself, “just to save our aching backs,” joked Jo Anne Trigo of Two Dog. It’s safer for the the staff to leave the purchases on the curb, where you can pick them up after they retreat, but the bottom line for many is that they just don’t have time to provide curbside service because orders are coming in thick and fast.                                              *[16 Apr]: 16 April 2020

Secrets can be nearly impossible to contain, and such is the case with Hidden Pond Resort. After my visit to this secluded spot, tucked into a 60-acre pocket of Kennebunkport on the southern coast of Maine, wild horses couldn't keep me from dishing about my discovery.      Sure, I was already familiar with walkable downtown Kennebunkport. Its greenways and charming streets hold a special place in my heart. It feels like time travel to a town where people still stroll, couples walk hand in hand, and everyone greets each other.      I was shocked when my sister, Cheryl, who resides less than two hours south, confessed she'd never been there. In an instant, the idea to celebrate her upcoming birthday at Kennebunkport's much-acclaimed Hidden Pond was hatched.      Check-in at Hidden Pond takes place in a building nestled in the depths of a birch tree forest that was part of an old estate. Here, we were given a map of the property and pointed to the road where we'd find our accommodations, aptly named The Stargazer. We were impressed with this bi-level, two-bedroom, three bath cottage -- and even more impressed by its interior, with its screened porch, full kitchen and dining room, fireplaced living room and outdoor shower.      The bedrooms were equally luxurious, no quibbling necessary. We left our luggage in our respective rooms and headed back out to locate The Tree Spa, where pre-scheduled aromatherapy massages were calling our names. The surrounding beauty of nature distracted us from following our map, however, and we walked straight past Earth, Hidden Pond's critically raved-about restaurant. Once we backtracked our steps, we stopped inside the restaurant for direction. Inside, we admired its eclectic decor, and outside, the saltwater pool was inviting, and right behind the pool, voila ­-- the Tree Spa. Ensconced in treehouse-style massage rooms, we inhaled both the aroma of the pine trees outside and the lavender oil being expertly rubbed onto our skin.      Afterward, relaxed and rubbery, we called one of Hidden Pond's complimentary shuttles, with the goal of hitting happy hour at Hidden Pond's sister property, The Tides Beach Club.      The club's unobstructed view of Goose Rocks Beach and the crash of waves against the rocks mesmerized us as we sipped on a pair of watermelon Cosmos. Could it get any better? Why yes, it could, I realized as I tucked into a best-of-my-life Maine lobster roll, paired perfectly with a glass (or two) of chilled Chablis. The club's bar scene was lively, and we met a few patrons who said they'd returned to Hidden Pond twice, thrice or four times. This was not all that surprising.      Energized and not quite ready for the night to end, we stopped by the resort's communal firepit and indulged in s'mores, with all the luxury makin's ready for use, courtesy of Earth restaurant.      My sister is an early bird, and by the time I wandered downstairs from my blissful night's sleep, she had already dug into the coffee and pastries conveniently left on our doorstep. This was a "light" breakfast, but a heartier version is available at Earth.      We had a game plan for Cheryl's birthday and were soon on the road to Ricker Hill Orchards, a ninth-generation family farm about 60 minutes inland, to pick organic apples. Apple picking made us hungry, so we fueled up at Terry & Maxine's in the town of Turner. Their turkey and Swiss Rachel sandwich hit the proverbial spot.      Next stop, downtown Kennebunkport. As I'd hoped would happen, Cheryl was enchanted by the town and its unique shops, eateries and art galleries lining the charming streets.      Back at Hidden Pond, we headed to its garden shed, where we were encouraged to grab a vase and clip an arrangement of local wildflowers to grace the table at our cottage.      As the climax to this birthday weekend, I had arranged dinner for us at Earth. Our farm-to-fork meal featured an innovative menu created by Hidden Pond's Executive Chef Joe Schafer. It incorporated vegetables and herbs picked from Earth's on-site organic farm, freshly caught seafood and meats sourced from local purveyors.      No late-night s'mores for us this evening; we simply rolled back to The Stargazer cottage, flicked a switch, and chilled out by the gas fireplace for a while. We checked out the following morning, begrudgingly, as we longed to stay forever, hidden in the fold of Hidden Pond. Alas, it was time to return to real life.

Musk said the company's working "super hard" to roll out stop sign and traffic light recognition first, which some owners with early access to the Autopilot software have already shown off. Next on deck is the Reverse Summon that will be included in a "core" software upgrade later this year.


  When Smart Summon rolled out, we watched numerous instances of close calls as Teslas did their best to reach owners and pick them up from a parking lot or other areas. While novel, neat and a fun party trick, it's really not intended for public use with numerous other cars zipping around and pedestrians walking. We'll have to wait and see if the latest software update irons things out, especially if Musk foresees Teslas parking themselves without any guidance.

Time matters here. No small business can survive a forced layoff like this without pain, but some owners can just grit their teeth and wait it out. If you own your premises and don't have to pay rent, that's a huge advantage.

If there is enough of that pent-up business in the pipeline, the turnaround will be must easier for those firms.

This is reminiscent of the classic line in the VC/PE tech arena, namely, do you bet on the horse or on the rider (a topic extensively explored in my book on startups, see this link here). The horse is the underlying tech, while the rider being the entrepreneur. As seasoned investors know, you are likely better off to bet on the rider, an entrepreneur, one with the spunk and vision for the long haul, and do so since the odds are that they’ll find the right opportunities, even if it means pivoting to do so.

These days, things are different. Unlike earlier times when salt was churned out quickly, J.Q. Dickinson has a six-week process that involves solar evaporation. To augment the revenue of what is now a boutique operation, the company also hosts weddings, farm-to-table dinners and other events on the property.


  On a recent tour, Bruns explained how her ancestors made salt.


  It involved drilling deep into the earth to tap into the ancient and extinct Iapetus Ocean, which now produces salty water. The brine is boiled until the water evaporates and the crystallized salt residue is extracted, packed and shipped.


  In the early years of Dickinson & Shrewsbury, before modern drilling technology, hollowed out trees were used to dig down and tap into the brine. “They put a man down in there with a bucket and shovel and he would dig,” Bruns said.


  Calvin Grimm, a local filmmaker who spent two years researching slavery in West Virginia, added another detail. The men inside the hollowed out trees were often enslaved.


  “They start digging and about 5 feet down, ice old water starts rushing into the hole and after about two minutes of being in that water, shock will set in and you die,” Grimm said. “At times, there were a couple dead slaves down in the hole.”
