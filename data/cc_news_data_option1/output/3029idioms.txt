ATR has already announced plan to rightsize the organization in response to COVID. With production levels reduced by 50%, the reorganization will imply a reduction in headcount by 204 positions, including 186 in France. The process for information and consultation with fast and societal partners – and social partners has already begun with a view to reaching agreement this autumn.

The aircraft business is well placed, and its financial performance has been solid and resilient. EFA Kuwait remains a key program, and activities continued this quarter even if travel restrictions and the increase of COVID cases in Kuwait generate some obstacles, causing delays. But we expect a strong second half to support the cash flow profile on the contract, which is based on milestones and program achievements we are working on. And we expect the aircraft division to perform well in 2021, supported by a strong portfolio and key opportunities already in the pipeline. In particular in international programs such as Eurofighter, JSF and our trainer platform.

Thanks very much and good evening. Yes. I wanted to try and get a handle on the significant headwinds and tailwinds between the first half and the second half. We’ve already touched upon some of that. But a couple of things that strikes one, particularly is that ATR made a €34 million loss in the first half, and obviously, things are going to carry on being very difficult through the second half. But that look – sounds like an exceptional situation with only a single delivery. So question there is do you expect ATR to make a loss in the second half as well?

NEW YORK (AP) — Gio Urshela hit his first big league grand slam, Aaron Judge homered for a career-high fourth straight game and the New York Yankees extended their winning streak to five with a 5-2 victory over the Boston Red Sox on Saturday night. Nick Nelson (1-0) pitched three hitless innings to win his major league debut. At 6-1, the Yankees are off to their best start since 2003 -- the equivalent of 16-3 over a 162-game season. Boston dropped to 3-6. Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka made his season debut after recovering from a concussion sustained when he was hit in the head by Giancarlo Stanton's line drive during practice on July 4. Tanaka lasted just 2 2/3 innings and 51 pitches, tiring in his second time through the order. Xander Bogaerts chased Tanaka with an RBI double, and a second run scored on the play when shortstop Gleyber Torres dropped a throw from the outfield for an error. Left-hander Luis Avilán followed and got four straight outs, and Nelson entered to start the fifth. A 24-year-old right-hander who pitched at three minor league levels last year, Nelson started with a three-pitch strikeout of Tzu-Wei Lin. He threw at up to 97.8 mph with four strikeouts and two walks. David Hale finished the six-hitter for his third career save, his first this year. Judge homered in the first inning off Zack Godley (0-1), a 455-foot drive to left-center. Urshela hit his second homer of the season an inning later for a 5-0 lead, following three straight singles with a fly into the netting above Monument Park. The Yankees' first 10 runs of the series all scored on homers. Urshela also made a sparking defensive play at third base in the sixth, snagging Christian Vázquez’s grounder, steadying in foul territory and throwing on the fly to first to beat the...

We have continued to perform well, with good order intake again across all our main businesses. First half orders of €6.1 billion at a similar level to last year. Solid group revenue performance at €5.9 billion, again, in line with last year. And operationally, we have kept our organization up and running with facilities open. We saw signs of stabilization in Q2, but we have not been immune and as expected, we have seen some impact from travel restrictions and safe working rules affecting deliveries, program execution and productivity.

When word salads seemed to fall on deaf ears, the tech leaders tried to pivot and talk about the American values their firms spread and the competitive edge they would forfeit to China if their businesses were saddled with punitive regulations. The only mark missing from my hearing bingo card was an honest recognition of their motives and the effects of their business models on democratic discourse.
