More than 100 gender equity and civil rights advocacy organizations signed a letter to the incoming Biden administration's transition team recommending that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris stop enforcement of and move to rescind new regulations that reshaped how colleges respond to reports of sexual misconduct on campus. The new rules were put in place by the U.S. Department of Education in May and have since come under fire from higher education associations, advocates for survivors of sexual assault and women's rights organizations.

By its nature, such work must be done during the offseason because irrigators rely on water from the canals during the growing season. Bertrand said the nice weather recently has eased the work so far late this year.
 “We’ve been pretty lucky getting work done without too much frost in the ground,” he said.
 Harris said the work on the Government Highline Canal will include restoring its shape where needed. A fuzzy geotextile layer will be laid down to help protect the water-sealing PVC liner that’s put on top of it from the underlying earth and rocks. The PVC liner is covered with another fabric liner, and then three inches of concrete are added on top to help protect the canal from abrasion from sand and silt flowing through the canal.
 A drainage system also is being installed below the canal to help control the accumulation of underlying groundwater that can damage the canal lining when it is drained due to pressure exerted on it. The water in the canal when full otherwise counters that pressure.

 View Comments
 HANDY TWP. - A 32-year-old Byron man died Friday when the car he was driving left the roadway just north of Fowlerville.
 Police were dispatched to the crash at the intersection of West Allen and Fowlerville roads just after 11:30 p.m., according to a news release from the Livingston County Sheriff's Office.
 The man was driving a 2007 Pontiac G5 north on Fowlerville Road when he lost control, slid off the road and into a tree.
 He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the release. No one else was in the car at the time of the crash.
 The man was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash, the Sheriff's Office said in the release, and "speed and alcohol may be factors in this crash."

Part 1      Is there an Issue?      I dare to ask, Where are you going and where are you coming from with your political struggle? If one was to be presented with a brush to paint a picture of the political struggle in Zimbabwe, I am as sure as I am with night and day that you have various dimensions, the good, the bad and the ugly. There is no better symbol to project the polarity of political thought and persuasion about Zimbabwe than the fist and the open hand. These two symbols represent the two political protagonists in Zimbabwe, namely Zanu PF's revolutionary fist and MDC's openness in democratic engagement. The big concern is not about who is right, but what is best for the land of milk and honey or even more sinister is the standard by which we discern what is best for the country. In making the necessary evaluation to objectively address the Zimbabwean political quagmire is the need to put into perspective who it is right for or wrong for. Enough of the Zimbabwean political polarity and pluralism for now as we try and reflect on the big picture. Of late Zimbabwe has been infested by a dangerous political disease, probably more devastating than the Covid 19 pandemic. One cannot imagine a worse calamity than a combination of a marauding virus, a spate of demolitions by city fathers, a downpour of rain in an economy stagnated by sanctions sponsored by a one of the political parties. Before addressing this calamity bedevilling Zimbabwe it is important to put into perspective what politics should be about and what it needs for sanity to prevail.      Political Choice in Diversity Politics is universal and spans every human context of interaction of thought and life philosophies. Political thought, debate, reflection, choice and action start with an individual and stretches to the globe. What this suggests is that politics is complex because in one's mind the debate about what values to advance, align with or act on can be complex and gets complicated when a friends, family, groups, area, province, country, the globe, etc. The late president of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe divided opinion because of his unwavering stance on what he called total liberation, epitomised in land recovery from the beneficiary of colonial terrorism. Some of the readers need to be reminded that colonialism is an extension of slave trade, actually it is worse than the repression of the children of Israel in Egypt in the old testament. Colonialism had the oppressor taking control of everything about the poor masses in the colonies. In colonialism everything was decimated including various facets of humanity such as culture, democratic processes, possessions, human dignity, land and freedoms. The only thing the colonialist failed to do was to change the colour of the oppressed, but managed to instil a sense of self degradation. Broadly the slave in the colony was made to worship the master and aspire to reach the standard of the master. What is disturbing is that many who Mugabe fought for still mourn for the old slave master because of the sweet nothings of western glitters at the expense of the real substance in the natural resources that most of the west would sponsor instability and chaos so that they can steal wealth in the mayhem. In South Africa, the late former president would suffer for twenty-seven years in prison for the right of the black majority to have a democratic right. Throughout the world there are many struggles that nations and communities have faced in search of a voice for many and participation in self- determination. Maybe our understanding of politics needs a biblical context. The bible clearly presents the idea of being in the light or in darkness, signifying good and bad. However, as we would appreciate the children of Israel rebelled against Moses who was leading them out of repression and that is common even to this day. The idea of an alternative approach permeates nations the world over. What is of concern is the notion of a monopoly to perfection. Suddenly we are faced with the popular masterpiece by George Orwell in Animal Farm, where he presents the chilling reality that "All animals are equal, but others are more equal than others." In the United States there are two main political parties like in Zimbabwe and the same applies to the United Kingdom. It is a natural phenomenon that the different persuasions differ in approach. The differences in the political philosophies unfold into policies and implementation.

Moberg has never experienced the growth that Western Colorado is seeing. The difference with this migration and past ones is that people coming to Grand Junction are doing so because they want to, not because they need to for a job.
 That mindset brings opportunity for commercial developers, Moberg said. That explains why the gradual migration parallels businesses moving to the Grand Valley and commercial development projects popping up left and right.
 For example, on Oct. 22, Clifton welcomed a new Dickey’s Barbecue at 569 32 Rd. No. 11.
 Two other examples indicative of potential growth in Clifton are parcels of land at 3222 F Rd. and 3228 F Rd. Both are owned by Clifton F Road LLC, which is owned by a man named Richard Will. The office location is listed in Denver. The plan is to consolidate the two lots and then redivide it into four spaces, Moberg said.

IF Bishop Lazarus' great-grandfather were to rise from the dead today God forbid! The man was just an unbearably torturous disciplinarianhe would pretty much be able to figure his way around Harare.      Save for new names on old roads and the relatively new baby skyscraper Joina City nothing much has changed.      No, I lie!      He would probably froth at the mouth as he was always wont to do at the slightest provocation and irritation trying to find an explanation why the eternal fountain that used to spew sparklingly clean water at the heart of Africa Unity Square during his time is now eternally dry.      He would be mortified at how the formerly neat, lush and well-manicured lawn in the once-enviable park has now deteriorated into an unkempt and kinky outgrowth.      And he would probably collapse along First Street Mall precisely where George Silundika Avenue handshakes First Street where a lady, who is named Madhuve (Shona bastardisation of the word MaDube), has found a convenient abode.      There, at the heart of the city, next to an Econet shop, she is not ashamed to launder her knickers at a spot that has become her permanent "upmarket" tenement.      She even has a fireplace from where all her meals are prepared.      At night, she happily builds a reclaimable palace of lofty cupboard boxes that offers her all the nocturnal comforts she requires.      An often ignored but most important detail of her stay in the capital is where exactly this lady gets to relieve herself.      Well, you do not have to be Sherlock Holmes, or the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP)'s most intelligent or keen investigative officer, to know that you just need to pace up and down that route to be overwhelmed by the almost paralysing faecal odour from the nearby storm drains for tell-tale signs. Kikikiki.      Madhuve is a living, walking and breathing anecdote of how the city has decayed over the years. The First Street Mall is now essentially a decrepit and trashy alley compared to the classy and glittering walkway it was historically envisaged to be.      Multi-coloured light bulbs that used to dazzle the capital during this time of the year have since been stripped off, the formerly pristine concrete pavement blocks have disintegrated into rotten rubble, while the trees are now a sure accident that is waiting to happen on one fateful day.      Perhaps the Bishop's great-grandfather would marvel a bit at the new rustic stone cladding on the stilts that would support the embankment of the Mbuya Nehanda statue.      But he would definitely be confused by the legions of vendors that have taken over the cityscape and be outraged by how the bus termini Market Square, Charge Office, Copacabana and Fourth Street have been allowed to deteriorate into the egregious metallic wasteland they now are.      One needs not to mention the rarely functional traffic lights in the central business district (CBD), clogged storm drains and mounds of uncollected garbage that have become an almost tolerable part of the landscape.      By-laws are now non-existent.      Bishop Lazi never thought that he might one day remotely fear being swept away by a roaring river or snapped away by a daring crocodile in the middle of the city as he did last week when an unrelenting downpour turned most of the roads into raging rivulets.      This is what has become of our cities over the past two decades.      The capital city is to all intents and purposes caught up in a time warp.      It gets worse in the suburbs where refuse collection trucks are now a rarity as Halley's Comet, which is only visible from Earth every 75 years.      It is only recently that the Bishop warned that the fast-approaching rains would carve sinkholes and gorges out of our ubiquitous potholes.      Sadly, this has come to pass.      Tragedy      The tragedy is we now have a generation that does not know how a well-run municipality looks like or is supposed to be.      But our city fathers, who have been globetrotting to attend seminars in every part of the world, should know better.      One just needs to visit China, among some of the world's well-organised societies, to appreciate what real service delivery is all about.

A convoy of trucks loaded with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine are leaving the drugmaker's Michigan, manufacturing center on Sunday, carrying doses of the newly approved vaccine to hospitals and clinics around the US.
 "This is the moment of truth we've been waiting for at UPS. We have spent months strategizing with Operation Warp Speed officials and our healthcare customers on efficient vaccine logistics, and the time has arrived to put the plan into action," said Wes Wheeler, president of UPS Healthcare, in a statement.
 Pfizer's vaccine, developed with Germany's BioNTech, gained emergency approval from the US Food and Drug Administration on Friday. The company's expecting to supply 50 billion doses around the world by the end of the year, it said in a statement. It'll deliver a total of 1.3 billion by the end of 2021.
 The drugmaker on Friday detailed its US rollout of its vaccine, saying it was producing the drug at three US sites - Kalamazoo, Michigan; Saint Louis, Missouri; and Andover, Massachusetts.

We are convinced he can do a good job as he is a skilled driver. The plan for the test is simple, getting him to do as many laps as possible to give him a good feeling for an F1 car. This test will be very useful, both for us and for Marino and we will do our best to help him understand how an F1 team operates in all its different aspects. In addition, from a technical point of view he will certainly learn something from which he will benefit next year, when he will continue in the F2 Championship.

As a result, there are usually delays in clearing cargo and sometimes human traffic during peak periods because of limited space.      The Victoria Falls Border is a critical facility to the tourism sector as it is used by tourists especially in the Kavango-Zambezi Trans-frontier Conservation Area where a Uni-Visa model is being piloted. Before Covid-19, the border would attend to about 1500 travellers per day. Immigration department's North Western Region consists of Victoria      Falls, Kazungula, Pandamatenga and Binga Border posts as well as Victoria Falls International Airport. The Binga border is still under construction.      Upgrading the border will also be in tandem with the new city status, with the city already having the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) and the Victoria falls International Airport among other developments, which the President said were a symbol of hope and potential in the province.      President Mnangagwa also challenged the city leadership and all stakeholders to utilise the new status to boost national image towards growing the tourism sector and other national investment, trade and modernisation programmes.      He said the Second Republic is committed to implementation and completion of projects laid out in Matabeleland especially within the Victoria Falls-Hwange- Mlibizi-Binga-Sijalila Corridor.      "As the only city in the province and being at the epicentre of development matrix, Victoria Falls must provide leadership in all these endeavours. Furthermore, strong and enabling development control measures must be crafted and promoted to give impetus to the transformation of the city into world class smart city benchmarked against the world's best," said President Mnangagwa.      He said Government had allocated $19,5 billion for devolution in the 2021 National Budget, which should lead to development of the country with communities taking responsibility for their own development. The City Mayor, Councillor Somvelo Dhlamini, commended the Government for unveiling Devolution Funds, which he said had been instrumental in development projects in the city.

From just before the first race of the day, the men’s varsity, it was clear that the Piedmont visitors were having fun on their visit to the High Country, including team cheers and other motivational warmups to get the competitive juices going.
 “We love coming up here,” said Bobby Conrad, head cross country coach at Charlotte Catholic. “This was a beautiful day and wonderful weather. Watauga has the prettiest course that we run on. We enjoy coming up here and running against good competition. We were racing against Watauga and Mooresville’s athletes, but we were also racing against the course, too. So it was really good for our kids to have this experience. The competition lived up to my expectations, and then some.
 “We’ve always had a great friendly rivalry with Watauga,” Miller added. “They wore us out today, but it was good for our getting ready for upcoming events.”
 Watauga head coach Randy McDonough was all smiles after the varsity races, but appreciative for the increased level of competition.
 “I knew that both of these teams were pretty good coming into today,” McDonough said. “Our kids did pretty well, despite running a meet just two days before against South Caldwell. Most of our runners, both men and women, told me they had a hard time today because of running on Thursday, too. They said their legs just didn’t feel like they were there. But, as one of the parents pointed out to them, today’s performances showed that they were mentally tough and strong, physically, to be able to come back and compete well, two times in three days.
 “Yesterday,” added McDonough, “we gave them the choice of a run, nothing, or a hike. Over half the team took the hike instead of running. We just wanted to go as easy as possible, yesterday, and let them get the kinks out of their legs after competing on Thursday.”
 Asked about this non-conference event, McDonough said it was for a specific purpose in mind.
 “We set this up,” he said, “because these two teams are pretty good in their regions. We love the tough competition. That’s why we go to the Wendy’s and other meets, to give the kids a chance to see what it is like to race against the more competitive runners. But because of the COVID situation, those big events are not being held, so this is the next best thing. It has been tough in our area to get that kind of competition.”
