Michu enjoyed a prolific debut season in the Premier League with Swansea, scoring 18 goals during 2012-13, but an injury-plagued campaign last time out meant the 28-year-old scored just twice in 17 appearances.

 Michu enjoyed a prolific debut season in the Premier League with Swansea, scoring 18 goals during 2012-13, but an injury-plagued campaign last time out meant the 28-year-old scored just twice in 17 appearances.
 Benitez, who led the club to a third-place finish last season, believes the attacker will need time to adjust to his new role.
 "He played in midfield for Rayo [Vallecano] and has scored many goals in many positions," he said.
 "At Swansea he played as a second striker and as the front man.
 "He needs to get know his team-mates and our type of game, but I have no doubts about him because he is smart."
 Another new arrival at the club, Kalidou Koulibaly, has impressed Benitez, who believes the team will be stronger during the upcoming campaign.
 "He is very attentive, listens and has surprised me positively. He has learnt Italian and his acclimatisation will be faster.
 "The squad is strong and can be stronger if [Juan Camilo] Zuniga, [Giandomenico] Mesto, [Christian] Maggio and [Marek] Hamsik are at their level that was missing last year."

I met a man who I boldly called, my best friend and deepest love, on a website. Although he did have a few pictures posted, I barely looked at them, as the website would notify us every time someone looked at our pictures and I didn’t want to seem like a stalker. So, I generally knew what he looked like, but it wasn’t the main draw. In fact, a couple of the pictures made me feel the opposite of attracted to him. Most of our focus was on messaging and sending each other songs. We became so close through this, we shared emotions that we would not have if we had simply met and gone on a date.

The Chile international continues to be be linked with a move to Inter, while Galatasaray and an unnamed German club are also said to be interested in Cardiff's record signing.
 Medel, who is reported to have cost around £11 million when he moved from Sevilla less than a year ago, impressed during the World Cup and is expected to move on following Cardiff's relegation to the Championship.
 Dalman has insisted that the Welsh club will only sell if the price is right after Inter were reported to be keen for a loan move with a view to a permanent deal.
 He told _WalesOnline_ : "We are not going to take a loss on a player who was a World Cup star in Brazil.
 "We have made it clear what our price is and that won't change.
 "We will do the right thing for Cardiff City and the player. Our position has not changed.
 "There are clubs interested in him, but we have not reached agreement with anybody so far. We will not take a loss on a player who did so well for Chile in Brazil."

Thanks to the active role played by the police and also due to involvement of the public in policing activities, crime rate came down drastically in the newly formed Ramagundam Commissionerate of Police comprising Peddapalli and Mancherial districts.
 Property offences came down by 20.22 per cent with 523 cases being reported in the year 2017 compared to 659 cases in 2016. Chain-snatching cases were down to 73 per cent with only four cases being reported in the year, compared to 15 in 2016. Burglaries had come down by 10 per cent with 216 cases being reported compared to 239 cases in 2016.
 Cases of thefts also came down by 41 per cent with the reporting of 235 cases this year compared to 397 in 2016. Road accidents were down by 6 per cent in the commissionerate limits with 642 incidents compared to 842 last year. The murders had also come down by one per cent with 38 murder cases in this year against 40 cases in 2016.
 Above all, the Ramagundam police had been successful in checking crime against women in general and dowry-related cases in particular. The overall crime against women had come down by 6 per cent and the dowry deaths by 30 per cent and harassment cases against women by 19 per cent.
 The Ramagundam Commisionerate had involved people in the policing by constituting village defence squads (VDS). A total of 2,374 persons were appointed as VDS members for collecting information, that helped curb illegal activities and maintain peace and harmony in the villages.
 The police set a record by binding over 5,277 persons this year when compared to only 342 persons in the year 2016. They had also apprehended 464 property offenders. The use of 1,998 CCTV cameras, Hawk eye and other technologies were also instrumental in the reduction of crime rate. They also won accolades for their friendly policing and social service programmes through ‘Punarjanma’ and Police Mitra programmes.
 Commissioner of Police Vikram Jeet Duggal said that they are planning to open Cyber Crime lab in the Commissionerate very soon. There are also plans to open Facebook pages for every police station. Modernisation of police stations in Peddapalli and Mancherial districts is also on the anvil.

The 34-year-old headed to Canada in February as he searched for game time ahead of the FIFA World Cup in his homeland.
 Julio Cesar made seven appearances for Toronto and just as many for Brazil at the showpiece event, which they failed to win.
 In a statement on Friday, Toronto general manager Tim Bezbatchenko thanked the shot-stopper for what he had done for the club.
 "At Toronto FC we aspire to be internationally recognised as a leader in every aspect that involves our football club, and to be a consistent contender for championships in North America," he said.
 "With this ambitious vision comes the need for acquiring players of great character that leave an impact both on and off the pitch. Julio Cesar is certainly one of those players.
 "On behalf of everyone at Toronto FC, I'd like to send our sincere thanks to QPR for the opportunity to bring Julio to Toronto.
 "We'd also like to thank Julio for everything he brought to our club. He made an immediate impact and all of us are better for it."
 Julio Cesar is likely to be competing with Robert Green for the starting spot at QPR, who open their Premier League campaign with a clash against Hull City on August 16.

Carragher represented the Merseyside club 737 times from 1996 to 2013, including 508 league appearances.
 However, the one-club stalwart and local product was not asked to remain at the club in a coaching or advising role, and said he was "embarrassed" during his final season.
 "I was never offered a role by someone else or at Liverpool," Carragher told The Anfield Wrap podcast.
 "I told [manager] Brendan Rodgers 12 months before the end of that season that I was finishing. I knew I was finishing. I'd had enough of being a substitute.
 "I said to Brendan 'I understand [Daniel] Agger and [Martin] Skrtel are your first choice, I want to help you as much as possible as a manager. I want to play, if I play well obviously I'd love to play, of course' and I got back into the team which was a brilliant ending for me.
 "But he knew then that I was actually close to jacking it in halfway through the season just because I wasn't involved. I was embarrassed training every day."
 And Carragher, now a pundit with Sky Sports, said his chances of returning to Anfield on a permanent basis were small.
 "I don't think I'll ever move home, if I'm honest, so the chances of being a manager or a coach dwindle a bit there as I wouldn't be moving my family around this country, let alone Europe or whatever," he said.
 "Who knows in the future but I'm enjoying what I'm doing."

"The assumption underlying the motion – that one can infer from the juror’s opinions about the President that she could not fairly consider the evidence against the defendant – is not supported by any facts or data and it is contrary to controlling legal precedent," she wrote in denying the new trial. “The motion is a tower of indignation, but at the end of the day, there is little of substance holding it up.”
