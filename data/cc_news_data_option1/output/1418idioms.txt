Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson is remaining patient as the hunt for a new manager continues.


  Press Association Sport understands club officials have spoken to a series of candidates since Tony Pulis’ exit, but that no appointment is imminent.


  Boro coach Jonathan Woodgate is understood to have given a presentation on his blueprint for the way forward for a side which ultimately missed out on the Sky Bet Championship play-offs this season.


  Discussions have also taken place with former Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic, although sources on Teesside have played down speculation that he is a leading candidate.


  Former Boro full-back Michael Reiziger is out of the running after being appointed as assistant coach at Ajax, where he had been working with the club’s young players.


  Lincoln manager Danny Cowley, former Leicester boss Nigel Pearson, and ex- Preston and Sunderland counterpart Simon Grayson have all been touted as possible replacements for Pulis, although Aston Villa assistant John Terry, who has insisted he is happy where he is, is not believed to have been under consideration.


  Boro are understood to be looking in a different direction after twice missing out on promotion during Pulis’ reign – he took over from Garry Monk in December 2017 and saw his side go down to Villa in the play-off semi-finals five months later.


  Gibson has previous for appointing young, ambitious managers – he did so with Bryan Robson in 1994, Steve McClaren seven years later and also handed the reins to future England manager Gareth Southgate following McClaren’s departure in 2006 before giving Aitor Karanka his first managerial post.


  Southgate is not the only man to emerge from the ranks either – assistant Steve Agnew was given every chance to make the job his own after stepping in as interim boss following Karanka’s exit in March 2017, although it was to Monk that he eventually turned.

Liverpool midfielder Fabinho was something of a slow-burner following his summer arrival from Monaco but he believes arch-rivals Manchester United helped ignite his Anfield career.


  The Brazil international did not start a match until the Carabao Cup defeat to Chelsea in late September and by the start of November had played just six times, four of which were short substitute appearances.


  But from that point on he got a run in the team and December’s 3-1 victory over United, which ended Jose Mourinho’s reign at Old Trafford, was the game which proved to be the turning point.


  Since then he has performed a pivotal role as the holding midfielder in the team and put in his best display in the 4-0 Champions League semi-final, second-leg comeback against Barcelona, made even more impressive by his level of control after being booked early on.


  “I knew it would be difficult and there would be times when I would be out of the team,” he said as he prepares to face Tottenham in the Champions League final in Madrid.


  “But it was never in doubt that I’d made the right choice. Not every player transfers to a new club and gets straight into the team, as was my case.


  “Everybody told me that’s how the coach works. New players are not automatically thrown into the first team straight away.


  “In terms of adapting, there was a lot of preparation and a lot of hard work.


  “The two games in particular that stood out for me was the game against Arsenal – that’s when I really understood the speed of the Premier League and the attention to detail that is required – and in terms of building my confidence, the stand-out game was against Manchester United.


  “In terms of the game with Manchester United, it was probably one of the best of the season.


  “I managed to get an assist in that game (his clever, chipped pass set up Sadio Mane’s opener) and I really kept up with the rhythm and pace. I think we were much superior than Manchester United.”


  Coming from the more sedate Ligue 1, Fabinho accepts he struggled to get to grips with not only the ferocity of the Premier League but the sheer relentlessness of it.


  But having acclimatised to the relative lack of recovery time the 25-year-old has gone on to show Liverpool’s shrewd £43million purchase just a couple of days after last year’s Champions League final was more than justified.


  “I think it’s been excellent from a personal perspective,” he added.


  “Collectively, as a group, I think we’ve surpassed already high expectations given the success we’ve had in the Premier League and Champions League. Overall, excellent.”


  Although Fabinho had a vested interest in last year’s final against Real Madrid, knowing his move to Anfield was imminent, he did not spend any time analysing where he might be able to contribute for his new side.


  “I watched it and at the time I knew I was coming here to Liverpool,” he said.


  “I didn’t really think about where I’d fit into the team or my position.


  “I was watching it as a fan, so I wasn’t really focusing tactically. What really captured me was the passion of the fans and I wanted Liverpool to win.”

After the cold and dreary months of winter, I am always eager for spring and to decorate for the Easter season. For me, celebrating Easter and the joys of spring go hand in hand.      Once you make the decision to set a formal or informal table, then the fun can begin. We've become a disposable society where paper plates, cups and napkins are the norm for family gatherings. Consider using the opportunity to take out the fine china, crystal and flatware. If you don't own fine china, but would like to start your own collection, visit estate sales or antique malls. While you're searching for these goodies, keep your eyes open for ceramic bunnies, chicks and lambs. Vintage tablecloths, napkins and candle holders are often found for great prices.      For a semi-formal place setting, I have often used wicker chargers. Dollar stores offer so many unique items to "fill in the gaps" on the table. Consider small vine bird's nests, tiny Easter eggs to fill small baskets at each place setting and holiday-themed salt and pepper shakers. Fresh flowers are always appropriate to herald the arrival of spring!      For fun and informal meals, vibrant Fiestaware plates always bring compliments from my guests. If you don't want to purchase an entire set of dishes, neighborhood yard sales and estate sales are your friends. The best part of using Fiestaware (besides its bright colors) is the ease of mixing and matching. I've used pink, purple, robin's egg blue, green, orange and yellow all together for an Easter egg color-themed table.      If room allows, have a separate "kids' table." Children love the bright colors and, again, the dollar stores are a treasure trove of goodies for setting the perfect table for your youngest guests. Vinyl tablecloths that can be easily cleaned are perfect for the inevitable spills and drips. Melamine plates are suitable for the kids, along with plastic cups or glasses. Consider filling a large basket with plastic Easter eggs as your centerpiece. If time allows before the meal, let the kids decorate their own boiled and dyed egg to use as their place setting marker.      Don't forget about the serving pieces. Silver trays, vintage egg plates for stuffed eggs, cabbage shaped bowls for coleslaw and platters with a carrot motif all contribute to the beauty of your Easter table. Plan ahead and visit your local hobby or department stores the days after Easter. You'll find great bargains for next spring's family table.

_CMT GIANTSKenny Rogers: A Benefit For __MusiCares_ first aired on CMT on Wednesday night, featuring a number of artists paying tribute to Kenny Rogers with covers of his music. Randy Houser took on one of Rogers' most iconic songs, "The Gambler," for his performance, explaining that he first heard the song "riding in my daddy's Cutlass Supreme."


  "A lot of my memories associated with my father have to do with Kenny Rogers' music and his career as an actor," he shared. __Houser's cover featured the musician strumming an acoustic guitar to accompany himself for a simple and strong rendition that showed off his unique voice while hewing true to the original. "God bless you, Kenny Rogers," Houser said at the end of his performance. Rogers' version of "The Gambler" was released in 1978 as the title track from his album _The Gambler_ and went on to hit No. 1 on the _Billboard_ country chart and win the Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1980.


   _CMT GIANTS_ was hosted by Rita Wilson and also featured Dolly Parton, Gavin DeGraw, Jason Isbell & Amanda Shires, Jennifer Nettles, Lady Antebellum, Lionel Richie, Michael McDonald, Rascal Flatts, Vince Gill, songwriter Don Schlitz ("The Gambler") and singer-songwriter Kim Carnes ("Don't Fall in Love With A Dreamer"). Performances were interspersed with rare archival photos, interviews and performances as well as clips and commentary from Rogers.

  "Kenny Rogers was both larger than life and down to earth, a man who always went out of his way to help people - people who needed it," Wilson said during the show, which raised money for the MusiCares COVID-19 Relief Fund. "He was very commanding, no matter what setting you found him in but in a way that was always led by kindness and by grace," Vince Gill recalled of Rogers. "When he walked onto a stage, he owned it, and that's what the greats do."


  After Rogers' death on March 20, Houser visited his home recording studio to record a cover of Rogers' "Love Will Turn You Around." "Kenny Rogers was a huge influence on me as a singer and artist," Houser wrote on Instagram. "When I heard he passed, I was hurt like many others. Since I have been home I went downstairs into my studio and decided I would do something to hopefully honor him. So, here it is. I hope this helps bring some peace and positivity to the world in his honor."

Moscow, Apr 10 (AFP) The mayor of Russia's capital on Friday said the acceleration of coronavirus infections calls for tighter restrictions, as clinics in Moscow were approaching their limits.


  The capital has been under lockdown since March 30, but is struggling to cope with the influx of new patients, as some doctors began to question the reliability of testing methods.


  In a video address, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that "the work of most city organisations will be limited or stopped" at least for the next week, including building construction.


  He added that the city will phase in a "permit system" next week, primarily for people still going to work, but eventually for any movement even in the neighbourhood, if needed.


  The densely populated capital with more than 12 million residents has the largest outbreak in Russia, with 7,822 confirmed coronavirus cases out of a national total of almost 12,000.


  The number in Moscow's hospitals has doubled since last week and more than 85 per cent of these patients have pneumonia, deputy mayor Anastasia Rakova was quoted as saying on the city virus task force's Telegram account.


  Those who test positive but have mild symptoms are monitored through online video consultations.


  "Along with the growing numbers of people who are seriously ill, pressure has grown sharply on the capital's health service. Our inpatient facilities and ambulance service are now working at their limits," Rakova said.


  In what could complicate battling the spread, reports have emerged that up to 30 per cent of Russia's coronavirus tests are false negatives.


  Russia's top coronavirus doctor Denis Protsenko, himself infected and working from isolation in his office, said Thursday that medical experts had decided to treat all pneumonia cases as coronavirus.


  "False negative cases" dictate the need to rely instead on lung CT scans and symptoms, rather than COVID-19 diagnostic tests, he wrote on Facebook.


  Moscow's lockdown has allowed people to leave their homes for essential work, to buy food and medicine or to walk dogs within a radius of 100 metres.


  Driving private cars is permitted, however.


  Sobyanin warned that the epidemic was not even close to its peak.


  "I can tell you for sure: there hasn't been any peak yet. We are more in the foothills of this peak, not even in the middle," he told RIA-Novosti.


  He said Russia had gained time with its anti-virus measures and was rushing to prepare more clinics to deal with "the blow that is coming our way."


  Moscow is building a dedicated virus hospital with 500 beds from scratch in a few weeks. It is due to open this month. (AFP)

Student-athletes across St. Tammany Parish experienced a range of emotions — anger, sadness, denial — when the LHSAA announced it had canceled what remained of the high school sports seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The April 9 decision that the prep sports season was done wasn't unexpected, but that didn't make it easier for players to accept.
 “It hasn’t hit me for sure,” said Gentry Spinks, a senior on the Archbishop Hannan softball team. “When I read the text this morning, it felt like a slap in the face."
 Spinks will play softball in college at Louisiana Tech, and she's grateful for that chance. It's one hundreds of other student-athletes across the parish won't have, however.
 Baseball, softball, tennis, golf, track, bowling and gymnastics teams at high schools throughout Louisiana began practicing for their 2020 seasons earlier this year, and started playing several weeks before March 13. That's the date Gov. John Bel Edwards issued emergency orders that closed schools and many other institutions to promote social distancing and try to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 Private schools like Hannan, the defending Division II state champion, also were shuttered. The Hawks started the 2020 season with a 10-2 record and seemed likely to vie for another title, but COVID-19 denied them the chance.
 “It’s very disappointing, but we understand it,” Hannan softball coach Becky Lambert said. “We only had one senior last year, and we feel like we had a better team this year, so that makes it tough. They really wanted to win two state championships in a row. If they hadn’t won last year, it would be a much harder pill to swallow.”
 Every player on this season's team was a part of the championship squad a year ago, but not being able to play for a repeat is tough, Spinks said.
 “I thought we were going to come back, and then it got pushed back, and I just kept saying that it was just a pause. This morning was hard, but I’m grateful for my four years at Hannan. They just flew by. I’ll remember the relationships and friendships and how the coaches helped us grow. We’re like a family."
 St. Paul’s baseball coach Mick Nunez had just painted the numbers of his nine seniors on the field when news broke of the season being canceled for good.
 Nunez said he was glad each of the nine seniors was able to play in the Wolves’ last game — a 7-3 win over St. Stanislaus on March 12. St. Paul’s was scheduled to open district play against Slidell on March 17, but it didn't happen.
 The Wolves started the 2020 season with an 8-1 record after winning the 2019 Division I state championship a year earlier.
 “My heart goes out to the kids,” Nunez said. They sat patiently for two years to be that everyday guy, and now, they’ve had the experience cut short. I tell the kids all the time that it’s a game. You play wide open every time. I think what is going on is way bigger than a baseball game. They are learning a ton from this. I just wish they got to learn about facing and overcoming adversity on the field instead of missing the season. But it is what it is. I’m upset, but I would rather miss a season and save lives than play games and put people’s lives at risk.”
 Lakeshore baseball coach Steve Ceravolo’s team had a 9-3 record with 10 seniors, and figured to be a factor in the Class 4A postseason.
 “We were definitely a senior-laden team, especially on the mound,” Ceravolo said. “We felt like we had a good chance this year (to win state,) and that’s because of our senior leadership. This is tough in a lot of ways, but especially because of our senior class.”
 The disappointment spread beyond the diamond.
 Mandeville tennis coach Sean Esker emailed his players, including five seniors, with the message that their season was done. The girls team was undefeated so far in this season, Esker said.
 "We were just getting the season started, and then it was over," Esker said.

  Joe Kelly, pro golf Hall of Famer who works at the Las Vegas National Golf Club, spoke to News 3 about the move. He said: "We started the rakes out of the bunker, we sanitize flag sticks, we put inserts in the holes so the people don't have to touch the bottom of the hole that other people have touched. We stripped down all of the golf carts - taking the coolers off the carts, sand bottles, pencils, scorecards - we completely sanitize the carts after every round. We encourage one player per golf cart, we sanitize the range baskets and balls before they get them, and we changed our tee times from 10-minute intervals to 15-minute intervals so there are fewer people on the golf course at one time."

“Each complex has picnic shelters, food truck parking on the end of each parking lot as well as a concession and restroom building and a maintenance shed for park and rec equipment,” Ehnes said.


  Both designs featured four softball fields, which Ehnes said meets the state minimum for hosting statewide tournaments. The most notable difference between the two designs was the configuration of the second parking area located on the west end of the complex. In one design the secondary parking lot was located farther north, allowing for six soccer fields to the south and one next to the softball fields, the other design moved the parking lot farther to the south, only allowing for four soccer fields, and moving two next to the softball fields.


  Councilman Marty Clark asked whey there needed to be two parking lots in the complex.


  “We didn’t want just one choke point for people coming in and out of the complex … we wanted a couple different entrances on and off of Colorado and a couple different parking options as well.” Ehnes explained. “We had several people within the committee that have been to these other complexes where parking was done poorly and it ruined the entire complex.”


  The council voted to combine the two designs and went with the seven-field complex with the 160 lot residential design.

This Easter season, many of our neighbors and friends are having a hard time right now. And we’re all dealing with this new “normal.” Health care workers and first responders are continuing to put their lives at risk to fight an invisible virus. We’re so thankful to them for what they do. We’re also thankful for the folks who continue to go into work, day after day, to provide important services to our communities. For business owners who have had to make the difficult decision to close their doors temporarily, please know that we are working around the clock to help you access funding so you can keep employees on the payroll and be ready to open again as soon as the pandemic is over. Social distancing, while necessary, isn’t easy, especially for folks in rural areas, or who may be living alone. I encourage South Dakotans to call their neighbors, grandparents, parents or anyone they know who may be feeling isolated or lonely during this time. We’re all dealing with an unprecedented challenge, but we will get through it together.


  If any South Dakotan has questions or needs help, please don’t hesitate to contact my offices in Pierre, Rapid City, Sioux Falls or Aberdeen. All of our contact information can be found on my website,www.rounds.senate.gov.

Patna, Apr 10 (PTI) Vigil has been tightened along the India-Nepal border in Bihar following intelligence inputs about around 50 people infected with coronavirus planning to sneak into the country, amid the lockdown, officials said on Friday.


  Following imposition of the lockdown, the state's borders with Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal have been sealed with a view of preventing outsiders from entering Bihar.


  Director General of Police Gupteshwar Pandey said, "All police personnel deployed along the borders and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have been put on high alert. There have been no reports of any infiltration through the India- Nepal border ever since the restrictions came into force. We will ensure that nobody is allowed to cross the borders."


  Notably, screenshots of a letter purportedly written by a senior official of West Champaran and addressed to senior officers of the police and administration went viral on the social media during the day.


  Dated April 7, the letter stated that 40-50 people have crossed over to India and referred to a Nepalese national, involved in illegal arms trade and fake currency notes, planning a conspiracy to "spread coronavirus in India".


  The letter claimed that inputs to the effect were received from the SSB. Neither the district magistrate nor the superintendent of police agreed to comment further about the letter.


  Talking to PTI over phone, a senior SSB official did not confirm that the aforementioned input was provided to the district officials by the paramilitary force, but said, "We do keep receiving intelligence inputs in plenty since we guard the borders. A few of these turn out to be true, many others turn out to be hoax. It is, however, our duty to pass on whatever information we have to the civil administration concerned."


  Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Amir Subhani, however, asserted that the SSB inputs hinted at "a possibility" of infiltration through the borders.


  "But we are maintaining a strict vigil. Police are on alert and working in close cooperation with the SSB. The Union Home Ministry has also been kept in the loop," Subhani said.


  Bihar shares a long, porous border with Nepal that runs through more than half a dozen districts of the state.


  There have been apprehensions that many attendees of Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat congregation, blamed for a significant proportion of COVID-19 cases across the country, had visited Bihar and some might have travelled farther to Nepal.


  Many of the Tablighi Jamaat event participants, both Indians as well as foreign nationals, have been tracked down by the police within the state. All of them have been placed in quarantine though none of them has so far tested positive for the dreaded coronavirus.
