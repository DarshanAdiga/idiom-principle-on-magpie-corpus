But when the Navigators needed him, he stepped up. Williams accounted for 10 of his team’s 19 points in the overtime period to lead the Navigators to a 72-67 victory over Kearney High on Friday night at KHS.
 Williams finished with 33 points and 12 rebounds against the Bearcats, who dropped their fourth straight game.
 "What it comes down to is who can just take the game over and who’s the more elite players?" Williams said. "And I just took that to my advantage, and I know what I can do to close out the game."
 Williams’ basket about 15 seconds into the overtime period put the Navigators (14-6) ahead for good.
 After the Bearcats (10-10) tied the game at 53 on an Easton Bruce 3-pointer with 37 seconds left in regulation, they went cold on the offensive end the remainder of the game.
 They never led in overtime and even trailed by as many as nine points in the last minute of play.
 Seth Stroh paced the Bearcats with 19 points. Jack Johnson recorded 16 points and Bruce added 14 to round out the Bearcat players in double figures.
 "They did a nice job of making some buckets early," said KHS coach Drake Beranek. "Our kids continued to battle in overtime. It’s just one of those things where they have a couple of pretty good players, and they just made plays."
 Williams didn’t start the game since he missed practice. He checked into the game with 3 minutes, 26 seconds left in the first quarter.
 Williams’ offensive output was one point better than his season average. He made 11-of-30 shot attempts and was 8 of 14 on free throws against the Bearcats.
 Friday’s game marked Williams’ 10th contest of the season after missing the first half of the year recovering from a torn ACL injury that he suffered in an AAU basketball game in mid-April. He’s drawing plenty of Division I Power Five interest, including from Kansas State, Texas, Oklahoma State and Oregon, since decommitting from Nebraska in December.
 Williams’ play down the stretch against the Bearcats helped the Navigators improve their record to 3-2 in overtime games this year.
 "He’s a finisher," Lincoln North Star coach Tony Quattrocchi said.

Regardless of their political affiliation, our elected representatives in the U.S. House and Senate need to get on board the deficit-reduction bandwagon and turn things around. It’s apparent that our leaders want the 2017 tax cuts to stay in place, so to make progress against the debt, we’ll need to stimulate the economy and reduce federal spending.
 Trump promised in 2016 we would achieve a national economic growth rate of 4 percent. Soon after the 2017 tax cuts were enacted, national economic growth rose to 2.9 percent, but it has declined a bit and now stands at about 2 percent. Stimulating the economy might require another tax cut, but that strategy means even larger deficits, so federal spending must be restrained. Uncle Sam will need to cut a lot deeper to reduce debt and continue the vibrant national economy.
 We don’t anticipate seeing a lot of action on spending reduction before the general election in November, but results of the election could increase greatly the likelihood that the president and Congress are able to attack the national debt and significantly lower it. That opportunity would arise, we believe, if Trump wins re-election. In addition, it’s possible that Americans will retaliate against Democrats in the House of Representatives for impeaching the president. If Republicans win enough seats, the House could fall under GOP control, and Republicans would be in the White House and both houses of Congress.
 Republicans have branded themselves as the party of small government. If the GOP commands the House, Senate and presidency, the stage will be set for serious debt reductions.

John was drafted into the U.S. Army and served two years of active duty in Korea. He was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant first class in 1954.
 John was the fourth generation to farm the Little Family Farm. His lifelong goal was to purchase back the original tracts of land from his family heirs that his great-grandfather had originally purchased from the IC railroad in 1868. He was successful in this endeavor.
 John was active in many organizations. He was a member of the Tolono Lions Club for 68 years. He served on the Unit 7 school board. He was a charter member of the Parkland College Foundation Board. He was a district director of the FFA Alumni Association. He was a past trustee of Crittenden Township. He served as president of the Illinois Farmers Union from 1990-1993.

According to the Ciatti Company, the Lodi appellation experienced a decrease similar to the state in its total crushed tonnage, down by 9.4% from 2018.
 In 2019, the Lodi region crushed just 770,922 tons of grapes. The previous year, Lodi crushed a total of 850,687 tons.
 The Zinfandel grape crush declined by 16%, from 135,645 tons in 2018 to 113,887 tons in 2019. Last year’s Zinfandel crush was the lowest in Lodi since 2013.
 “(That) is a good thing,” Lodi Winegrape Commission executive director Stuart Spencer said of the state’s 2019 harvest size. “Considering we’re in a bit of oversupply in California, I think this will help things come closer to being back in balance.”
 Over the last few years, the Lodi region had seen a decline in popularity of some of its varietals, particularly Zinfandel.
 In September, Spencer said the increase of red blends have contributed to the decline in Zinfandel’s popularity, coupled with the fact that the cost of manual labor to pick grapes off the vine has gradually increased.
 On Thursday, Spencer said many vineyards have remained unpicked. However, it is not limited to the ZInfandel varietal, and it is not limited to the Lodi region.
 Lodi’s Cabernet Sauvignon grapes saw the largest decline in 2019, decreasing by 17.9 percent. In 2018, the region crushed 198,838 tons of the variety. Last year, 163,246 grapes were crushed.
 While the tonnage was 30,000 less than 2018’s crush, Spencer said Lodi’s Cabernet Sauvignon harvest was still a large component to state numbers.
 “Overall, the grape market will follow the wine market, which has been flat this year,” Spencer said. “Now we have to see if the market remains flat, or if are we going to get new customers this year. There are a lot of questions right now, that only time will tell.”

A highlight of the Crush Report came from the Sauvignon Blanc varietal, which saw a 15.3 percent increase in tonnage from 2018. However, the Ciatti Group did not have specific tonnage numbers prepared for the Lodi Sauvignon Blanc grape.
 While the Sauvignon Blanc grape is not as significant as the Zinfandel or Cabernet Sauvignon in Lodi, Spencer said, local wineries do make some of the best wines in the state with it.
 “We have seen some increase in acreage out here when it comes to the Sauvignon Blanc grape,” he said. “At the end of the day, the Sauvignon Blanc is growing in the wine market, and a lot of that has been from the wines coming from New Zealand. We’re now seeing a lot of growers planting more of that varietal.”
 Across the state, the total Zinfandel grape crush in California was 345,214 tons, down 11% from 2018.
 Chardonnay remained at the top of the crush list in 2019, with 638,029 tons crushed across California. However, that number was down 10.4% from 2018.
 California’s Cabernet Sauvignon crush saw a decline of 15.5% in 2019, producing 574,285 tons.
 According to the CDFA report, the average price of all grape varieties was $790.43 per ton, down 5% form 2018. Red wine grapes were down 2.9% form 2018, valued at $990.07 a ton, while white wine grapes were down 8.6%, valued at $580.66 a ton.
 Spencer said maybe these lower numbers will help the state’s wine industry turn around in the years to come.
 “It was nice to see a lighter crop, and my hope is it helps us get back to where we were last year,” he said. “But at the end of the day, we need more people drinking California wines, and we need to grow the market so we’ll all be successful.”
 Lodi is part of the state’s Crush District 11, which includes San Joaquin County north of Highway 4, south of Highway 50 in Sacramento County and east of Interstate 5.
 Crush District 13, which encompasses Madera, Fresno, Alpine, Mono and Inyo counties, as well as the northern regions of Kings and Tulare counties, had the largest share of the 2019 crush, producing about 1.3 million tons.
 The average price per ton in District 13 was $300.60, according to the report.
 The final Grape Crush Report 2019 will be released on March 10.
