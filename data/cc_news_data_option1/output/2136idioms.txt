Almost three years ago The CW favorite Greg Berlanti was tapped to direct a big screen reboot of _Little Shop of Horrors_ for Warner Bros. Pictures. Though filming on the project has been delayed in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the cast is still eager to get in front of the cameras, or in the case of Emmy and Tony Award-winning _Pose_ star Billy Porter, lend his voice to its villain. Porter previously signed on to voice the ever hungry Audrey II in the film, and in a new interview has opened up about his love for _Little Shop of Horrors_ as a whole and what he'll be bringing to the man-eating plant.
 "This was one of the musicals that is from my generation, from the 80s, so I've known it, the songs have been my audition songs for years," Porter told _Collider_. "And I was also in the out-of-town revival tryout before it went to Broadway back in 2002, and I got let go from that so I've already played the voice of the plant. And I just approached it from the standpoint of what it truly is; it's kind of like the Faustian story. It's kind of like the devil story. Like, 'Sell your soul to me and I'll give you everything you want.' He's a villain! And I don't get to play villains very often, so get ready because he's gonna be everything. All of the things! I'm gonna use all of the different ranges of the voice!"
 It was previously reported that _Kingsman_ and _Rocketman_ star Taron Egerton is in talks to appear in the film as Seymour Krelborn (previously played by Rick Moranis in the 1986 feature adaptation of the musical) with _Black Widow_ and _Jojo Rabbit_ star Scarlett Johansson up for the part of Audrey, Seymour's love interest and the namesake for the musical's carnivorous plant. This pair and porter will join Chris Evans, who will make a heel turn in the film and play the abusive Orin Scrivello, aka "The Dentist" (the character was originally played by Steve Martin in the 1986 feature film).
  _Little Shop of Horrors_ has a very unique history on the big screen and elsewhere. The film first began as a movie (sans musical numbers) in 1960 from legendary filmmaker Roger Corman. Up until the musical it was only notable for being one of Jack Nicholson's early movies. In 1982 the stage musical opened Off-Broadway to critical acclaim and was adapted in 1986 for the big screen with Frank Oz directing. Since then it has been revisited on the stage in many forms and even became the basis for short-lived animated series in the early 1990s.

El Salvador reports more than 2,500 infections and 46 deaths.
 In Guatemala, a 9-year-old boy was swept away by a river and drowned and another person was killed when a home collapsed, said David de León, spokesman for the national disaster agency.
 Amanda pounded El Salvador with rain for days before moving ashore as a tropical storm on Sunday and pushing across Guatemala.
 It quickly dissipated, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Monday afternoon its remnants had formed into a tropical depression in the Bay of Campeche off Mexico's gulf coast and was expected to move through the Gulf of Mexico in coming days.
 Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Campeche west to the port of Veracruz, expecting the depression to become a tropical storm Monday night or Tuesday.
 It had sustained winds of 30 mph (45 kph) and was expected to move slowly just off the Mexican coast for the next couple days. The storm is expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over the Mexican state of Tabasco and Veracruz with up to 20 inches in some isolated areas.

If you watched the historic SpaceX launch over the weekend and thought the suits astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken were wearing looked very cinematic, you're not alone - and for a very good reason, at that. The designer behind the suits, Jose Fernandez, is part of the collaborative effort that is Ironhead Studios, one of Hollywood's leading special effects firm for the movie industry. Within the past few years, Fernandez and Ironhead have been responsible for designing and outfitting heroes in movies like _Batman v Superman, Captain America: Civil War, TRON,_ and _The Amazing Spider-Man._
 The process first began in 2016 when the Elon Musk-founded SpaceX approached Fernandez and asked him to participate in a design competition for the custom- made suits. As it turns out, Fernandez's helmet design is the piece of the suit that sealed the deal for the relationship.
 "He (Musk) kept saying, 'Anyone looks better in a tux, no matter what size or shape they are,' and when people put this space suit on, he wants them to look better than they did without it, like a tux. You look heroic in it," Fernandez tells _Forbes._
 The designer is no stranger to making iconic helmet pieces either - Fernandez was the one who came up with the designs for both Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) helmets in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plus the cowl design Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne wore in _Batman v Superman._
 The studio's work doesn't stop there - other credits they have on tap include _Alice in Wonderland, Batman Returns, Battleship, Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Godzilla, Planet of the Apes, Transformers, Watchmen,_ and _X-Men._ Oh, and they designed the costumes Daft Punk wears in public on top of everything else.
 It's unclear just how long Hurley and Behnken will remain at the International Space Station as mission controllers at NASA have yet to determine the length of the mission. At the earliest, they'll return to Earth at the end of this month; conversely, they could be aboard the ISS for another four months.

"And then we'll be looking ahead to that next mission, the Crew-1 flight, and looking at the vehicle readiness and trying to determine what's the smart thing to do relative to the mission duration."
