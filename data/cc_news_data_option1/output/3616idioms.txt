Mary L. Fox, a long-time political and community activist, died Saturday, September 5 at the age of 91. Mary chaired the re-election campaign for former U.S. Rep. Sid Yates, organized major fundraisers for campaigns of former state Rep. Dawn Clark Netsch, mayoral candidate Bill Singer, alderman Marty Oberman and many others. She was a leader in the 1960s and 1970s of the Independent Voters of Illinois/Independent Political Organization. She was also an early fighter in efforts to curb handgun violence, as a Board member and major fundraiser for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. Until her death, she served on the Board of the John R. Houlsby Foundation, which supports initiatives providing opportunities for Chicago youth. She made many other contributions to civic organizations too numerous to mention, never missing an opportunity to improve her community. Her dedication to social activism and superb organizational skills made her a natural leader in every organization she joined, and every endeavor she started. An audiologist by training, she joined the field when it was relatively new, in the 1950s and helped create audiology programs at many hospitals. Later, she started two businesses, one catering and one selling antiques, building the latter from a small antiques-collecting hobby into a thriving and profitable business. In her spare time, she was an avid reader and world traveler, often accompanied by her husband Jay. She grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, received a B.A. from the University of Iowa, and a master's degree in audiology from Northwestern University. She was preceded in death by her parents, Rosa and George Livingston, sister Judy Burgess, and husband Jacob L. Fox. She is survived by her daughters Katie and Laura Fox, sons-in-law Scott Welker and Ben Vandebunt, and grandchildren Ali Vandebunt, Kate Vandebunt and Jacob Welker-Fox, as well as her niece Ann Lettes and nephew Dana Burgess and their children. A celebration of her life will be organized when the public health situation allows people to gather. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, www.ichv.org.

A Nampa hobby farm is hoping to set the record straight about the quality of care their animals receive.      Lydie Watters says her small farm is a dream project she only recently started building one animal at a time, but has been the subject of numerous local complaints to the SPCA.      Watters says her animals are being given the best care she can give them. She says the SPCA has visited her place four or five times this year and she says they have never found anything wrong. She has taken to local social media to let people know the complaints were groundless.      “I have no way to approach my accusers because none of you approached me in person except Shirley Gach [who showed up at my door]. I believe that anyone should report animal abuse and that this service is essential for their well- being. So thank you for doing your due diligence,” she writes in a post from Feb. 25.      “Please continue to report issues you see and I’ve got nothing to hide and welcome the Alberta SPCA any day.”      Watters says she was accused at first of running an illegal puppy mill, but she has all the papers saying the dogs were fixed.      “They were neutered at either Dr. Tara’s in Grimshaw or at the Peace River vet. I don’t have a puppy farm,” Watters says.      “I’m the annoying friend who says we need to spay or neuter our animals.”      Watters says another complaint was about a sheep who she got with overgrown feet, even though she had posted on local social media that she was actively searching for someone to trim the sheep’s hooves and found someone to help shortly after bringing the ram home.      Watters’ hobby farm is visible from the highway near Nampa, and she thinks people who don’t know a lot about animals may be driving by and thinking a horse eating the greener grass over a fence may be going hungry, or a horse lying down is in distress when it’s just sleeping.      “I know everybody knows me for having like this death farm,” Watters says. “So it bothers me that people will talk and say, ‘Oh, I know where you live, and I’m thinking, but do you? Because none of them are sick.’”      Watters says she has adopted dogs from the SPCA and In the Woods Animal Rescue, and rescued a horse from auction.      She has paid out of pocket to get healthcare for rabbits and other animals she has rescued who have health problems as part of her own commitment to taking on animals and giving them better care.      “To tell you the truth I have problem cases everywhere,” Watter says.      She points to a horse she says has foundered, and quickly lists off the health and behavioural issues she has had to address with her other horses.      “Juniper wasn’t trained, now we can have a rider on her, Mary has one blind eye so she’s very difficult to work with. The really tall [horse] came to me for free from a lady who screened tons of people, talked to my friends, talked to Healing Reigns, to see how I am with horses. I got her for free because she needs a good home. She was attacked by a cougar on the back legs. I’m not somebody who would sell her for meat, not somebody who would try to ride her.”      Watters says she is planning on getting certified to do equine assisted learning and the horse is very intuitive so she is happy to have her for that in the future.      “She’s a joker, she’ll pull things out of your back pockets, get you out of a funk,” Watters says.      She adds the farm has been good for her mental health after suffering depression, and good for her children’s mental health as well. One of her dogs is serving as a service dog for her daughter.      Watters says she has poured all of her time and money into the animals.      She also says she asks friends who are experts in the animals for help all of the time.      “I’ve got mentors,” Watters says.      She says she has also done research on her animals before getting them.      “I guess the biggest thing is awareness. If my neighbour could understand what to look for,” Watters says.      “It sucks because the SPCA drives all the way from Edmonton for this and I’m thinking there are actual cases with starving horses.      “If the goats get out they’re not trying to escape because they hate it here, it’s because they’re goats,” Watters says.      Watters says while the number of times the SPCA has come has given her children some anxiety the animals they love will be taken away, she understands that whoever is calling the SPCA actually shares her love of animals.      Dan Kobe, the SPCA’s communication manager, says the SPCA’s first priority is always to see if any animals are in distress.      “Our goal is to relieve that distress,” Kobe says.      He adds even then, in the majority of cases, they are able to talk to the owner of the animals and make suggestions on how to improve conditions for them. Animals are only taken into custody if the animals are in distress and the owner is not willing to take any action to improve their conditions.      The SPCA doesn’t normally name anyone under investigation unless charges are laid.      The SPCA has active offices in Calgary, Edmonton, and Okotoks.      There used to be an SPCA officer based in Grande Prairie but Kobe says staff there hasn’t been replaced yet. However, he says SPCA officers routinely drive up north two to three times a month.      “Driving four hours isn’t a big deal,” Kobe says.      If an animal is in severe distress and can’t wait, he says the SPCA can send a bylaw officer or police officer instead, and can authorize euthanasia over the phone.      That may be the case for downer livestock.      In all cases, the SPCA is there to listen when someone calls, and will ask questions to help determine if they should send someone to the location of the animals or not and how quickly.      “If someone has a concern, they should call us,” Kobe says.      Attempts to contact Gach for comment were not successful.

Season openers have the potential to be tricky. There are going to be mistakes, mental and physical. It comes down to how each team and individual responds to those mistakes and handles the adversity that comes along with it.
 Tonight, Lake-Lehman hosts Berwick to open up the 2020 season, an abbreviated one, with the Wyoming Valley Conference playing an eight-game schedule.
 And by chance, when the schedule was revised from a 10-game model, to a seven- game model and now settling on eight, it is Lake-Lehman that gets one of the more challenging matchups on opening night.
 When scouting Berwick, Lake-Lehman coach Jerry Gilsky sees a few things that jump out at him. The defensive line is physical and the second and third levels of the defense fly to the football.
 “We are going to have to sustain drives, with our quick-tempo offense, we can’t afford to have three-and-outs,” Gilsky said. “Then you are giving the ball to a team that runs the triple option that can grind out the clock. We have to maintain the ball and keep it in our hands.”
 If anybody knows about grinding out the clock it’s Gilsky. Before switching the offensive scheme to more of a spread offense, the Black Knights relied mainly on the ground game and were able to keep the ball and the clock on their side.
 But looking to take advantage of quarterback Ethan Adams and a talented set of receivers, the Black Knights turned into more of a throwing team.
 To compound matters, Lake-Lehman is coming into the game without having played a scrimmage. The Black Knights were supposed to scrimmage Valley West, but that was canceled because the Spartans were not going to have the allotted number of practices to have a scrimmage. Meanwhile, Berwick scrimmaged Southern Columbia.
 “We’re not even tested and Berwick is coming off Southern Columbia and still being Berwick football,” Gilsky said. “We don’t have any film to correct. We are out of practice mode and jumped right into game mode. At this point it is about executing and limiting our mistakes. We are putting a lot on our experienced players. We do have a lot of seniors, a lot of them started since they were sophomores.”
 Lake-Lehman’s defense is going to have to contend with Berwick’s triple option. The Bulldogs do have some schemes where they pitch the ball out of motion sets.
 “It’s more of assignment football,” Gilsky said. “The kids are going to have to make their reads. To prepare for that in a week is difficult for any program. You don’t see this type of offense on a weekly basis. They try to get you unbalanced and use that as leverage.”

There's no resilience gene to help us deal with adversity. Experts say it's a skill to foster, a muscle to pump up.
 Six months into the twin calamities of a pandemic and a tough economy, this may be a good time for a resilience workout.
 Resilience is the ability to withstand, bounce back and grow in the face of stressors and changing demands. "For a long time, people believed resilience was kind of a trait, something you have or you don't," said Vanessa Downing, a psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware. "Now we know it really is much more a set of skills that can be taught and learned."
 Downing, who worked for many years to help heart patients and caregivers become more resilient, now directs the ChristianaCare Center for WorkLife Wellbeing, part of Delaware's largest health care system. As colleagues have struggled to cope with COVID-19, she said, "We have really doubled down on the importance of understanding what resilience really means, and what it takes to create lasting resilience. It's a huge issue, especially at a time when there's so much facing people, whether they work in health care or not."
 Dr. Abby Rosenberg, an associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle, agreed.
 "The time you really need to dig deep and activate your own resilience is when life seems hard," said Rosenberg, a pediatric oncologist at Seattle Children's Hospital. She specializes in promoting resilience among young patients with serious illness and their families.
 "It's the process of harnessing the resources we need to get through that tough time and maintain our well-being. Resilience gives you the ability to say, 'Yes, it's hard, and this is how I'm going to get through it.'"
 The benefits are not just psychological. Resilience helps to lower stress, and chronic stress is linked to health consequences that include high blood pressure, depression and heart disease.
 A study published last year in the Journal of the American Heart Association indicated that African Americans living in neighborhoods more conducive to resilience - specifically, neighborhoods with better aesthetic quality, healthy food availability and a lack of violence - had less cardiovascular disease than their counterparts with the same level of cardiovascular risk factors who lived in other areas.
 A 2018 study published in Psychological Science found people who reported higher levels of lingering negative feelings from daily stressors had more chronic conditions almost a decade later.
 So, how do we become more resilient?
 Take care of yourself
 "That means ensuring our own basic needs are met," Downing said. "Things like getting enough sleep, trying to eat nutritious meals and making sure our social connections are there even when we have to be physically distant. That may require a lot more work than in our pre-COVID way of living."
 And with so many people now working from home, it's important to set healthy work boundaries to prevent overworking and burnout. Maintain a regular work schedule and allow time for lunch and breaks.
 Reflect on problems you've overcome before
 "What have you done in the past when things were hard?" Rosenberg said. "That can help people think about which particular resources they need now, and to be able to ask for help."
 Focus on gratitude
 "Our brains are hard-wired to notice the negative, and that's what sticks with us more," Downing said. "You have to take proactive steps to balance the scales."
 To put that into practice, she said, "At the end of each day, record one or two good things that happened. Take a moment to open a window and simply let the air brush over your skin. Find a way to notice the moment rather than rushing through it to worry about the future."
 Don't go it alone
 "Some people think about resilience as a Lone Ranger, pull-yourself-up-by- your-bootstraps kind of mindset," Downing said. "What really helps us get through challenging times is having people in our life to help us meet our needs."
 Practice
 "It's easier to say and harder to do," Rosenberg said. "But it's like any skill. If you want to learn to ride a bike, you have to practice. And you may fall down a lot. You have to pick yourself up and keep trying."
 Hang in there
 Part of the resilience journey is sometimes just getting through the day, Rosenberg said. "The longer this (pandemic) drags on, the more the uncertainty can weigh us down. But it doesn't mean we're not going to get through it."

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Expert salvagers have begun working on a fire- stricken oil tanker off Sri Lanka’s coast after an Indian coast guard aircraft sprayed dispersants to contain an oil slick coming from the vessel, the Sri Lankan navy said Friday.
 The MT New Diamond, which is carrying nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil, was damaged by two fires in a little over a week.
 After the second fire was extinguished Wednesday, salvage experts climbed on board on the ship Thursday for inspections. They have now begun salvage work, giving priority to repair a leak in the ship’s fuel tank, said navy spokesman Indika de Silva.
 The 17 experts include British and Dutch professionals — rescue operation specialists, disaster evaluators and legal consultants. They have been sent by New Shipping Ltd., the commercial owner of the New Diamond in Athens, Greece.
 The oil slick near the ship is about 10 to 30 meters (yards) wide and about a nautical mile long and an aircraft from the Indian coast guard on Thursday sprayed dispersants on the slick, the navy said.
 The patch is likely to be heavy fuel oil from the ship, it said. The ship has about 1,700 tons of heavy fuel oil to power its engines.

“My view is really that you have to have responsible regulation,” Bernhardt said during a meeting with The Tribune-Democrat editorial board on Thursday. “But you can have all of those things thrive at the same time because I’ve seen it. I’ve lived it. And I really think that that is really where the president comes down at the end of the day. We’re going to have clean water. We’re going to have clean air.
 “We’re going to come up with ways to do things that are economical.”
 Trump’s administration is in favor of hydraulic fracking, a process that uses chemicals and pressurized fluid to crack rock and capture natural gas, which is supported by the fossil fuel sector, but generally opposed by environmental groups.
 The debate has been at the political and environmental forefront in Pennsylvania during the past decade.
 “In Colorado, lives have been fundamentally changed by advances in technology for oil and gas development,” Bernhardt said. “They’ve been changed in a lot of ways. I’ll give you an example. My hometown, there’s a maternity ward that wasn’t there when I was little, and it’s there because it was built with severance taxes from oil and gas operations.
 A lot of folks I know have been employed in a town that they wanted to live in that probably, when I was growing up, they didn’t have no jobs.
 “They’re pretty good jobs.”
 He described the call for no fracking as an “unsophisticated statement” in his opinion.
 “It’s incredible to the economy,” Bernhardt said. “When people make statements about no fracking, my view is they generally don’t understand.”

After struggling to meet the expectations created by his 2017 season, the Arizona Diamondbacks on Thursday designated third baseman Jake Lamb for assignment.
 Lamb, 29, was an All-Star in 2017 when he hit 30 home runs with 105 RBIs. But he hit just 12 home runs in three seasons since, with 62 RBIs, as shoulder issues took their toll.
 To fill Lamb's spot on the roster before Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Diamondbacks selected the contract of infielder/outfielder Pavin Smith, who was the No. 7 overall pick in the 2017 draft.
 Lamb has played in 596 career games, batting .239 with 81 home runs and 303 RBIs. He was a sixth-round draft pick by Arizona in 2012.

Meier finished with a match-high 13 kills along with 12 digs and four blocks as the Iowa Class 5A No. 9 Mustangs took down the Golden Eagles in four sets on Thursday night.
 Through two and a half weeks, nobody has cracked Hempstead. They improved to 8-0-1, and Meier has been the focal point.
 She followed up her ferocious Set 4 kill with a block to give the Mustangs a 6-4 lead. Five points later, Meier found herself at the service line, where she rattled off six straight points for a 15-6 lead.
 Hempstead never looked back after that.
 “They look to (Meier) mentally and physically,” said Mustangs coach Jacque Arensdorf. “She’s obviously our go-to person when we need to get points rattled off right away. She can hit from anywhere on the court.”
 As Hempstead drew closer and closer to victory, Meier was at the center of it. Her back-row kill forced the Eagles to burn their second timeout of the fourth set with a 17-8 lead. Wahlert (1-7) fought back within 21-17 before Becca Lockwood’s slide-kill sided out for the Mustangs. Grace Daack then served Hempstead to match point, 24-17, and two plays later, Meier delivered the final nail — another middle set that she crushed to her left for a 25-18 win.
 “They are a very good team and we expected Wahlert to play us close,” said Meier, a senior and four-year starter for the Mustangs. “When we got to that point, it became ‘we know we’ve got this in the bag.’
 “I’m honestly so happy with how we’re doing. I think we’re a great team and we haven’t reached our potential yet.”
 Before the fourth set, it had been quite a rollercoaster match for both squads. A five-point serving run by Meier pushed her team to a 23-13 lead in Set 1 and Lockwood sealed it with another slide for a 25-16 opening victory.
 To start the second, Lauryn Montgomery served Wahlert to a 4-0 lead and the Eagles never trailed. Mia Kunnert used another strong run — five straight from the service line, to push her team to 23-11. The Mustangs scored four of the next five points, but Wahlert ultimately tied the match at a set apiece with a 25-15 victory.
 The pendulum swung back Hempstead’s way in Set 3. Meier’s bounce was the start of a 10-2 Mustangs run for a 14-7 lead. The Eagles inched back within five, 17-12, before Lockwood followed up a kill with a block, part of three straight for a 20-12 Mustangs lead.
 Meier tagged the back line with a kill to put her team to set point, and a Wahlert error on the next play gave the Mustangs a 2-1 advantage in the match, 25-15.
 “We took care of the first ball really, really well in the second set, and I think we had a lot of fight the entire match,” said first-year Eagles coach Paige Griffith. “But all the other (sets), you could go back and look at rotations that we were stuck in and we just couldn’t get out of it. We had to fight back the entire time and we just weren’t in control.
 “We’ve had a struggle. These past three weeks have been little ups and big, big downs. But I think our fight showed through. We played some solid defense, we just didn’t put points together. We’re getting there.”
 Lockwood and Ashley Glennon finished with seven kills apiece for Hempstead. Lockwood added eight blocks and Morgan Hawkins finished with a team-high 29 assists.
 Claire Walker and Ivy Dearstone paced the Wahlert offense with eight kills apiece, Montgomery finished with 32 assists and Kunnert had a match-high 17 digs.
 With the coronavirus pandemic forcing schools to limit attendance, around the court, Moody Gym didn’t have the “look” of a usual intracity volleyball match.
 But in between the endlines, Meier said the energy these two teams brought to the court gave this Hempstead-Wahlert rivalry the usual high-stakes treatment.
 That’s why it felt so good to be on the winning side.
 “We came into this game super excited,” Meier said. “We knew that if we wanted to win, we’d have to come out with our intensity and energy and really just pound the ball. And I really think we did.”

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Figaro’s had to convert to take-out service and as restrictions have been lifted now offer outdoor seating and has closed one of its dining rooms to lower capacity by 50 percent Sinclair said.
 To accommodate families, the take-out dinners feed four to six people and range price from $39 for chicken parmigiana or chicken francese, to seafood risotto with shrimp, clams and mussels for $59.
 Nolasco said that the menu has otherwise remained the same.
 He said his personal favorite items on the menu are the New York strip steak and the chicken parmigiana.
 “We make a variety of pasta and sauces,” he said. “I love them all. The bolognese is probably my favorite. I think most of the people love the bolognese. It’s a variety of meats and veal mixed together. The Toscana sauce is another one of people’s favorites.”
 For people who are looking for a desert, he said that the tiramisu and the New York cheesecake are excellent.
 Specials are still offered on the menu, Nolasco said, which rotate.
 A favorite, he said, is the braciolle, a thin pounded steak, rolled with chopped egg, sausage, parmesan, prosciutto, and anisette burgundy sauce.
 Sinclair said that the people of Enfield have been supportive of the restaurant’s efforts to stay open.
 “They’ve been very supportive,” he said. “They want to be there to make sure we survive through this; ordering take out and telling their friends to check us out.”
 Nolasco said that he hopes the pandemic will be over by the end of the year and things will find its way back to normal and they can begin having live events again at the restaurant and have buffeted group gatherings.
 At 71, he said, he has no plans on quitting and retiring.
 “I love my business,” he said. “I love what I do. I’m not going to retire.”

Expert salvagers have begun working on a fire-stricken oil tanker off Sri Lanka’s coast after an Indian coast guard aircraft sprayed dispersants to contain an oil slick coming from the vessel, the Sri Lankan navy said Friday.
 The MT New Diamond, which is carrying nearly 2 million barrels of crude oil, was damaged by two fires in a little over a week.
 After the second fire was extinguished Wednesday, salvage experts climbed on board on the ship Thursday for inspections. They have now begun salvage work, giving priority to repair a leak in the ship’s fuel tank, said navy spokesman Indika de Silva.
 The 17 experts include British and Dutch professionals — rescue operation specialists, disaster evaluators and legal consultants. They have been sent by New Shipping Ltd., the commercial owner of the New Diamond in Athens, Greece.

 Reliance Industries Ltd. reportedly has offered a 40% stake in its retail arm worth about $20 billion to Amazon.com, Inc., a report the company said was speculative.
  _Bloomberg News_ , __ citing a source, reported “Amazon has held discussions about investing in the conglomerate’s Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd. unit and has expressed interest in negotiating a potential transaction.”
 The report went on to say that Reliance was “willing to sell as much as a 40% stake in the subsidiary to Amazon” and the deal size at $20 billion would be the biggest ever in India.
 While Amazon refused to comment, Reliance said, “In light of a high incidence of speculative media queries and incorrect and ex parte media articles relating to purported capital transactions into Reliance Industries or our group companies, we would like to reiterate that as a policy, we do not comment on media speculation and rumours and we cannot confirm or deny any transaction which may or may not be in the works.”
 The company evaluates various opportunities on an ongoing basis, it said, adding that the company has “made and will continue to make necessary disclosures in compliance” with listing obligations and disclosure requirements.
 “Vide this communication, we appeal to the media to carefully examine any such speculative information and safeguard themselves and their readers, many of whom are individual retail investors, from publishing/recycling unfounded and/or incorrect news,” Reliance said.
 Amazon was an investor in Future Group, whose retail business was acquired by Reliance late last month for ₹24,713 crore. On September 9, RIL announced the divestment of 1.75% stake in the retail arm to private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for ₹7,500 crore.
  _Bloomberg_ in the report further stated that Amazon hasn’t made any final decision on the size of its potential investment and that talks could still fall apart.
 Commenting on the issue, Credit Suisse said if the deal fructifies, then this will bring together the largest offline and online retailers in India.
 “The combined entity can leverage the deep offline retail network of Reliance Retail and established logistics network of Amazon to harness cross-selling and omni-channel opportunities, leading to faster growth in e-commerce penetration in India,” it said.
 JP Morgan said, “if any such transaction were to happen, it would be positive as Reliance Retail would effectively co-opt its largest online competitor.” It, however, raised question over 40% stake offer, wondering what the implications for futire IPO plans would be, assuming RIL would like to retain a similar or higher stake.
 “It is also not clear if any such large-stake sale cash would stay with the parent or be used to grow retail further,” it added.
 According to Credit Suisse, Reliance can benefit via increase in addressable user base for its online grocery delivery service JioMart, by getting access to Amazon’s 140 million monthly active users.
 Also, it could push higher B2B sales for Reliance Market (cash-and-carry arm) through sellers on Amazon (Cloudtail, Appario Retail).
 Amazon can benefit by leveraging the established offline network of Reliance Retail for pick-up of online orders. It could expand user base by tapping footfalls in Reliance Retail stores to drive online cross-purchases, and gain access to a large logistics network, which has further strengthened post Reliance Retail’s acquisition of Future Group’s logistics and warehousing business, it said.
 Reliance has already announced the expansion of JioMart to electronics and fashion by end of this month.
 “Balance sheet will be significantly strengthened post the deal,” it said, adding, the series of stake sales in Reliance Retail to Amazon and private equity investors can bring in $21-29 billion cash.

When most people think about disaster striking in the outdoors, they think of the most dramatic events imaginable. From rampaging bears to wayward bolts of lightning, the Hollywood outcomes usually pictured are also those that almost never happen. The disasters that actually strike close to home are both much more mundane and more common.
 Since states implemented mandatory hunter education decades ago, instances of accidental shooting have declined dramatically. Today, falls from treestands and creeping hypothermia are the two woes much more likely to claim an outdoors enthusiast than a bear, a shark or anything else that could be brought to mind.
 Both of these outcomes are entirely preventable, so easily so, in fact, far too many fail to consider them at all.
 When he hit the ground at the base of the tree, Jon Cunningham broke 12 ribs and many other bones, injured countless internal organs, lost the use of his left hand and, ultimately, lost his career. Still, he counts himself lucky.
 Through the years as an Oklahoma game warden, Cunningham had certainly seen enough to know what could happen in a treestand-related fall, yet it took falling himself to realize the ultimate truth.
 “It can happen to anybody,” he said. “It happened to me.”
 He doesn’t remember the fall, but recalls waking up on the ground in extreme pain, pulling his cell phone out of his pocket, noticing the time was an hour later than he remembered it being, then dialing for help.
 “I called my son and said, ‘I’m hurt really bad,’” Cunningham says. Rescuers loaded him onto the rack of a 4-wheeler and transported him through the woods on a ride he terms “the most painful thing in my life” to the nearest place a helicopter could land. Six years later, the injuries still plague him.
 “I lost the use of my left hand, so the doctors won’t release me to go back to work,” he said. “I have to retire, though I’m lucky to get to retire. It cost me my career, but it could have cost me my life.”
 Mind the gap
 “It turns out that 86 percent of all treestand falls happen in transition,” says Jay Everett, with Hunter Safety System. “Investigations find that, in 82 percent of treestand falls, the hunters were wearing a harness at the time, just one that wasn’t connected to the tree when they fell.”
 Jody North, from eastern Kentucky, suffered some of the worst luck any hunter could have on afternoon a few years back, but he counts that day as his most fortunate on Earth.
 Moving a tall ladder stand to a new spot, he was without his safety gear when he climbed up and began working to secure the ladder to the tree.
 The stand slipped off the tree and North rode it sideways more than 20 feet to the ground. Fractures to ribs, vertebrae and his pelvis, along with a collapsed lung, were the result. He was lucky to still be alive, lucky to survive the 45-minute wait for ambulance and helicopter, lucky to walk again soon after.
 “I only did it once,” he said of climbing without safety gear, “and I’ll never do it again. It’s a miracle I’m here at all.”
 Gear to secure hunters once they’re in the stand, along with gear designed to keep them safe throughout the transit to and from, has come a long way in the past few years. Called a lifeline, the best of these products consists of a main line that’s attached above the stand. The line hangs alongside the tree and is tied off at bottom and top. Sliding along this main line is a Prusik knot with a carabiner that clips into the top strap of the hunter’s safety vest.
 Hunter Safety System sells the lifeline for lock-on-style treestand users for about $39. A model designed to keep climbing stand users safe runs about $20.
 Although hypothermia is something we normally associate with blizzards and deep snow banks, it can strike any time the weather is cool enough to drop our core body temperature below 95 degrees, so dressing in layers and paying attention to the weather is necessary, even in Mississippi’s warm climate.
 Hypothermia can occur in any of the four seasons, and it can come on gradually as well as rapidly. It’s certainly not specific to cold weather.
 The condition is divided into a series of stages. Mild hypothermia, when body core temperatures are between 95 and 90 degrees, is accompanied by shivering and drowsiness.
 Running hot, cold
 Treatment for mild hypothermia is generally mild itself. Dry clothes, a blanket or sleeping bag and a fire should be sufficient. Past this point though, things become much more serious in a hurry.
 In the moderate form, with the core falling between 89 and 83 degrees, hypothermia victims can appear to be intoxicated. They often exhibit delirium, slowed reflexes and altered judgment. By now shivering may have stopped and the victim is in serious trouble.
 Left untreated, core temperatures can fall below 82 degrees, wherein the condition becomes severe and consequences like coma and cardiac arrest become real possibilities.
 Victims who’ve proceeded into the moderate or severe phases should be aggressively treated, given warm, non-alcoholic liquids to drink, piled with blankets, warmed by other bodies and delivered to a medical facility as soon as possible.

A dedicated mother and grandmother first and foremost, she also enjoyed her faith, crafts and bright green thumb. Mary is survived by daughter Rosie Davis; son Abel Herrera; and treasured grandchildren and great- grandchildren. Mary was preceded in death by her daughter Renee Bustamanate and her son Ricardo Bustamanate. Mary had a heart of gold but she resided in a state where her leadership felt there were "more important things than living," as stated by Texas Lt. Governor Patrick. Like thousands of others #MarkedByCOVID, she should still be alive today. Her preventable death is due to the most craven, callous failures of the federal and state government. Her beautiful life should have never been collateral damage in their rush to reopen the economy. COVID-19 is claiming a 9/11's worth of U.S. victims every three days. So Mary's daughter is galvanizing her grief into ensuring the country elects government officials who will not put a dollar figure on human life.

The U.S. government has reportedly invented a new nuclear weapons system behind closed doors to defend against any nuclear and missile threat from North Korea.      The Washington Post on Wednesday (local time) shared a preview of “Rage,” a new book written by its editor Bob Woodward who broke the Watergate scandal. “I have built a nuclear — a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before. We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody — what we have is incredible," U.S. President Donald Trump told the editor, according to his book.      Woodward argues in “Rage” that President Trump mentioned the nuclear weapons system while being reminded how closer the comment on “fire and fury” drove Washington and Pyongyang to war back in 2017 when their relations got ever worse. President Trump’s remarks seemingly intend to say that the U.S. government invented a new nuclear weapons system that can protect against North Korea’s attack during war. According to The Washington Post, Woodward writes in his book that anonymous sources reaffirmed that the U.S. military gains access to a secret new weapons system but they refused to disclose any details.      President Trump exchanged a total of 27 letters with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to Woodward’s book. Calling President Trump “Your excellency,” Kim reportedly stated that their “deep and special friendship will work as a magical force” and hoped their meeting to be “reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film.” Woodward writes in the book that Kim candidly expressed anger about the continued U.S.-R.O.K. joint military exercise. As to Kim’s obsession about nuclear arsenal, President Trump likened Kim to “somebody that’s in love with a house and they just can’t sell it,” according to Woodward.         lightee@donga.com

Tracking female divers, or haenyeos in Korean, who survived from a sunken passenger boat revealed a tragic story. The elderly in Gadeok Island all mentioned the sinking of Hanil when asked about the past events. “I still remember dozens of bodies laid on Mongdol beach near a breakwater. Only 12 survived out of over 100 who boarded the boat. It was a cold winter day with strong wind and high waves so it was a miracle that some of them swam for hours and survived. Four of the survivors were haenyeos who were used to swimming in the winter,” said the elderly. I was quite shocked at the following story of Hanil’s sinking in 1967.      On January 14, 1967, 140-ton passenger boat Hanil that traveled between Busan and Yeosu departed Yeosu with 108 passengers and 13 crew members on board. It collided with 1,900-ton marine destroyer Chungnam 73 in the northwest sea of Gadeok Island, Busan. Hanil, a wooden vessel, was heavily damaged and sank 10 minutes later, which led to the deaths of over 90 people. The investigation of the incident revealed that the engine of Hanil was the same engine used in Changkyung, which sank in 1953. Meanwhile, Changkyung was a repurposed boat by salvaging Cheonsanhwan, which used to travel between Busan and Shimonoseki during the Japanese colonial period and later sank from the bombing of the U.S. armed forces as it was mistakenly identified as a munitions boat. The 1954 sinking of Changkyung also caused hundreds of deaths and the engine of the boat was later reused in Hanil. Tragic incidents repeated from Cheonsanhwan to Changkyung, and later to Hanil.      Han Geon, a local historian of the Dadae port area, remembers the sinking of Changkyung. “The Dadae port coastal waters where Changkyung sank is a narrow strait called Hwajungumi between Hwasondae and Gori Island. It has such a strong current and wind that the fleet of Admiral Yi Sun-sin had to wait here for the wind to slow down during his sailing to Busan to repulse the Japanese military that occupied Busan port and Dadae port. Changkyung was recovered long past its sinking and the bone of missing passengers was found in the hull.” On Jan. 9, 1953, the number of deaths from the sinking of Changkyung, a regular ferry connecting Busan and Yeosu, exceeded the number of people recorded in the passenger list. The total number of deaths, including the bodies washed away, is estimated to be over 300. The main causes of the incident were thought to be the overcrowdedness and overloading of the ship. The passenger ship did not even have any survival equipment on board as it was stored in the warehouse of the ship’s owner due to concerns about theft.      The direct causes of the sinking of Cheonsanhwan, Changkyung, and Hanil may have been different – the bombing of the air force plane, the overloading and strong waves, and a collision with a battleship, respectively. However, they all had common factors, such as the repurposing of a ferry, overloading, and the lack of safety equipment. After such a shocking incident, a pop song titled “Hanil of Misfortune” was released. “Chocked scream in the night of cold northeaster. Many lives were taken away without even crying,” the song says. The new port in Busan, which can be overlooked from Gadeok Island, is expanding to a massive scale with the goal of becoming the top 3 container ports in the world with large ships traveling back and forth constantly. The peaceful ocean reflecting the sun may have forgotten the tragic history but we should remember that the tragedy was a disaster caused by human error, not nature.

Locker rooms won’t be used at halftime in the LHAC and showers will be prohibited after games, conference Executive Director Scott Close said.
 The twists and turns have become commonplace for student-athletes, many of whom had their spring sports seasons wiped out while some also had their PIAA basketball playoffs canceled deep in the state bracket.
 “We’ve got a real mature group of kids and our team is very appreciative of the opportunities that we have to be out here,” said Richland coach Brandon Bailey, who in his role as director of educational services testified to the Pennsylvania Athletic Oversight Committee Zoom Aug. 18 meeting on how school sports can be played safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “Every practice has been great, it’s been crisp,” Bailey said. “Kids have been flying around because I think they appreciate the opportunity to come out here and do this with their friends.”
 Chestnut Ridge coach Max Shoemaker had similar thoughts.
 “In light of COVID-19 the kids are just anxious to get out on the field,” Shoemaker said.
 Greater Johnstown High School football coach Bruce Jordan said all Trojans athletic teams and students participating in extracurricular activities have strictly followed guidelines to ensure safety throughout the summer.
 “All of us coaches want to make sure our students stay healthy and safe,” Jordan said after the PIAA announced plans to move forward last month.
 “Anytime we’re indoors we always wear a mask,” Jordan said. “We sanitize our equipment on a daily basis. We take temperature checks every time we meet so that we can be sure. We have questionnaires and ask them various questions to make sure they haven’t had any exposure to COVID-19.”
 Throughout the summer and into fall practice, the protocols have become a practical routine.
 “When we’re on the field we can continue to do social distancing,” Jordan said. “It’s a little bit different. We used to have a ‘water buffalo’ where it was community water. Now we have a coach there with individual disposable cups so that they don’t have any cross contamination.
 “At the beginning of the summer it was a little difficult because those were things we didn’t plan on doing,” he said.
 “Now, it’s become the norm for us. Kids have adapted to it and they want to play. We’re able to sanitize our equipment. We’re able to keep the kids socially distanced. We’re able to get them all the refreshments they need without having cross contamination.”

 MELBOURNE, Sept 11 (Reuters) - The Melbourne Rebels have cheered locked-down fans by making the Super Rugby AU playoffs and want to bring more sunshine to their home city with victory against the Queensland Reds on Saturday, hooker Jordan Uelese said on Friday.
 The Rebels are set to play their first playoff of any kind at Brisbane's Lang Park, having failed to make the postseason in Super Rugby since joining the wider competition as an expansion side in 2011.
 Melbourne is in hard lockdown as authorities battle to quell an outbreak of COVID-19, which forced the Rebels to leave their home state of Victoria and play their entire Super Rugby AU schedule away.
 "It means a lot, especially with everything that's going on in Melbourne," Uelese told reporters.
 "To give (fans) something to be happy about during this tough time, that's all we play for each week.
 "We go out to play eighty minutes to put smiles on people's faces in Victoria.
 "I think it means a lot as a Victorian and even the guys who are from Sydney who have been in Melbourne for two and three years – they're Victorian now – so it means a lot for the club.
 "To make history this year would be awesome."
 Dave Wessels' Rebels snuck into the playoffs with a 34-30 defeat of the winless Western Force. After a long season on the road, they face a tough task against Brad Thorn's Reds.
 The Reds beat them 19-3 at Lang Park in August and also the table-topping ACT Brumbies 26-7 last week.
 The Rebels were frustrated by the Reds defence last time and need to convert pressure into points on Saturday, said Uelese.
 "Last time we went up there, it was our attacking footy – not converting our tries in the 22 and obviously we got held up on the line five times as well," he said.
 "It's probably all about converting those opportunities in the opposition 22."

North America currently dominates the bone cancer treatment market, and it is expected to continue its stronghold for a few more years. This region is expected to increase its market share in the future, owing to the fact that, currently, in the region, mainly in the United States, many clinical trials are underway for bone cancer therapies. Some studies are testing new chemo drugs. Researchers are also looking for new ways to use the existing approved drug portfolio. For instance, doctors are studying whether adding a bisphosphonate called zoledronic acid (Zometa) to the bone cement, which is used in filling the space left after removing a giant cell tumor, may decrease the chances of that tumor returning in that place.

Mary L. Fox, a long-time political and community activist, died Saturday, September 5 at the age of 91. Mary chaired the re-election campaign for former U.S. Rep. Sid Yates, organized major fundraisers for campaigns of former state Rep. Dawn Clark Netsch, mayoral candidate Bill Singer, alderman Marty Oberman and many others. She was a leader in the 1960s and 1970s of the Independent Voters of Illinois/Independent Political Organization. She was also an early fighter in efforts to curb handgun violence, as a Board member and major fundraiser for the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence. Until her death, she served on the Board of the John R. Houlsby Foundation, which supports initiatives providing opportunities for Chicago youth.      She made many other contributions to civic organizations too numerous to mention, never missing an opportunity to improve her community. Her dedication to social activism and superb organizational skills made her a natural leader in every organization she joined, and every endeavor she started. An audiologist by training, she joined the field when it was relatively new, in the 1950s and helped create audiology programs at many hospitals. Later, she started two businesses, one catering and one selling antiques, building the latter from a small antiques-collecting hobby into a thriving and profitable business. In her spare time, she was an avid reader and world traveler, often accompanied by her husband Jay. She grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, received a B.A. from the University of Iowa, and a master's degree in audiology from Northwestern University. She was preceded in death by her parents, Rosa and George Livingston, sister Judy Burgess, and husband Jacob L. Fox. She is survived by her daughters Katie and Laura Fox, sons-in-law Scott Welker and Ben Vandebunt, and grandchildren Ali Vandebunt, Kate Vandebunt and Jacob Welker-Fox, as well as her niece Ann Lettes and nephew Dana Burgess and their children. A celebration of her life will be organized when the public health situation allows people to gather. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence, www.ichv.org.

 # Opinion: N.Y. Debt vs. tax breaks for the wealthy
 K. Dixon Zorovich
 Penn Yan
 Senator Tom O’Mara professes to be concerned about New York’s debt burden (“The COVID-19 debt burden on future generations is clearly alarming” in the Sept. 2 edition of The Chronicle-Express).
 Like clockwork, O’Mara and his fellow Republicans voice outrage over government spending when the beneficiaries of that spending are the regular working people of New York. When it’s time to give tax breaks to deep-pocket corporations and the wealthiest among us, however, debt is no longer so troubling and worries about deficits seemingly disappear.
 We need someone in Albany who understands how to balance fair taxation and prudent fiscal management with the investments in public health, education, and infrastructure needed in our community.
 This election I am enthusiastically voting for Leslie Danks Burke, who will bring to our district outstanding leadership and experience and who will work hard on behalf of all New Yorkers.

Democratic Party of Korea leader Lee Nak-yon and People Power Party leader Kim Jong-in had a meeting at the National Assembly on Thursday morning, which was chaired by National Assembly Speaker Park Byeong-seug. It was the first official meeting between the two leaders although Lee had visited Kim after he took office. They agreed to pass the fourth supplementary budget as soon as possible.      Lee asked President Moon Jae-in to organize a meeting with Kim at the presidential office on Wednesday. It is said that President Moon emphasized the importance of cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties. However, President Moon and Kim have never had an official meeting although it was discussed multiple times after Kim became a party leader. It seems that now they are left with bitter feelings about each other. While the government and the ruling party are enjoying a good relationship, the ruling and opposition parties are on the opposite side.      To promote real cooperation, the ruling party should let go of political power and reflect upon what they have done wrong. After securing 176 seats in the 21st National Assembly, the Democratic Party of Korea has churned out new laws and elected its members as standing chairmen of most National Assembly committees. This should change. If the ruling party continues to see the opposition party as an obstacle to legislation, real bi-partisan cooperation will not be achieved. The bi-partisan cooperation President Moon mentioned should not mean the opposition party giving in to the ruling party’s demands.      The opposition party will become more cooperative if the ruling party starts to treat it as a political partner and initiates dialogue. They both should take a step back and start working together with policies they agree on and then expand cooperation slowly over time. The two parties saw eye to eye on the second round of disaster relief grants, and it is a great starting point.      Politics have been polarizing the public when we are facing a crisis that might be difficult to overcome even when everyone joins forces. President Moon and Kim should have an open discussion, irrespective of the formalities. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Both the ruling and the opposition parties will face criticism if they obsess over their political interests disregarding the demands of the public.

The epidemiologist Martin Blachier is more reserved. _" The measure of not being more than four, five or six at the same time is much more restrictive than wearing a mask", _he said on Franceinfo on September 9, in reaction to England's announcement to limit gatherings to six people. _" I think that in the medium or long term, the mask is much more playable and tenable than limiting social relationships to this point, which leads to a total overhaul of all our relationships with each other. It is not very far from confinement. The mask is particularly interesting because once it has been accepted and we have become used to it, it allows for a life that is almost normal. "_

Mary Castro   April 9, 1945 - May 17, 2020   Irving, Texas - Mary Castro, age 75, passed away in Irving on May 17 after battling COVID-19 for just five days. A dedicated mother and grandmother first and foremost, she also enjoyed her faith, crafts and bright green thumb.   Mary is survived by daughter Rosie Davis; son Abel Herrera; and treasured grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Mary was preceded in death by her daughter Renee Bustamanate and her son Ricardo Bustamanate.   Mary had a heart of gold but she resided in a state where her leadership felt there were "more important things than living," as stated by Texas Lt. Governor Patrick. Like thousands of others #MarkedByCOVID, she should still be alive today. Her preventable death is due to the most craven, callous failures of the federal and state government. Her beautiful life should have never been collateral damage in their rush to reopen the economy.   COVID-19 is claiming a 9/11's worth of U.S. victims every three days. So Mary's daughter is galvanizing her grief into ensuring the country elects government officials who will not put a dollar figure on human life. No one should have to lose their life for the sake of the stock market.
