Conservation practices such as stream-side buffers, restored wetlands, contour strips and fields planted with cover crops are just a few visible signs of the work of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service in Wisconsin. The agency provides funding and resources to farmers to learn management practices to make a positive impact on water quality.
 The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Wisconsin in 2019 partnered with farmers to apply conservation practices to more than 370,000 acres to directly improve water quality. It also signed agreements with producers on 1,316 farms to apply cover crops on 289,000 acres, an important soil-health practice to improve water quality.
 The agency’s conservationists work with farmers, ranchers, private forest landowners, partners and local soil and water conservation districts to plan and implement conservation practices. More than 170 individual practices and suites of practices are offered, which can be used to improve soil health, water quality, air quality and wildlife habitat. When planning such practices staff works to help producers maintain or improve agricultural productivity.
 Agriculture can and does play a critical role in improving water quality and other natural resources. Because more than 80 percent of Wisconsin’s land is privately owned, considerable water quality and other natural-resource improvements will be achieved by farmers, ranchers and private forest landowners.

DeChambeau, who turned 27 on Wednesday, was already a pretty big hitter when he decided to gain 40 pounds of muscle mass this year to help fuel a swing speed that propels his drives at 200 mph. It’s paying off: He is leading the tour in driving distance, with an average of 322.1 yards; in the second round of the Travelers, his tee shot off No. 10 went 422 yards — the sixth-longest drive on tour all year.
 DeChambeau faltered during the FedEx Cup playoffs after a strong summer run, including a tie for fourth in the PGA Championship — his only top 10 in a major.
 But this is the U.S. Open.
 “Our U.S. Open DNA is about placing a premium on accuracy off the teeing area,” said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s senior director of championships. “We think that premium — by driving a player to drive his ball into the fairway and hit his approach shot from the fairway onto these magnificent putting green complexes and keeping the ball below the hole — is key.”
 Bodenhamer said the USGA will “let Winged Foot be Winged Foot” — in other words, they don’t need to do anything to make the course tougher. At Merion, they narrowed the fairways and made the rough super thick; at Shinnecock, they put the pins in tough spots as the greens were baking out.

“We’re in a better place, regardless of how we got here or how painful it was during the time we waited to get this moment,” Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said. “That’s all behind us. What’s beautiful is that we have a process and protocols in place that’s based on science and based on lessons learned since Aug. 11.”
 The Big Ten said its Council of Presidents and Chancellors voted unanimously to restart sports. The vote last month was 11-3 to postpone, with Ohio State, Iowa and Nebraska voting against.
 Still, the Big House in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania, won’t be packed with 100,000 fans as is usually the case in the fall. Not even close. Tickets will not be sold to the general public for Big Ten games, though some attendance is expected.
 That’s still an 80,000-seat stadium that we don’t have,” said Wisconsin athletic director Barry Alvarez, who had estimated the loss of football would cost the school $100 million.
 The decision to play came after sharp pressure from coaches, players, parents and even President Donald Trump, all of them pushing for a Big Ten football season. The conference is home to a number of battleground states in the November election, and Trump swifly applauded the move in a tweet while his campaign suggested the return of college football was “in no small part” due to the president’s leadership.
 Northwestern President Morton Schapiro, chairman of the presidents’ council, said the turning point for him on giving the green light to football — even though many students have not been allowed back on his school’s Evanston, Illinois, campus — didn’t come until this past weekend. “For me, it wasn’t about political pressure, money or lawsuits,” Schapiro said. “It was about the unanimous opinion of our experts. It evolved over the course of weeks.”
 The Big Ten will take a bow, but the conference has been battered for a month and businesses in college towns from Nebraska to Maryland have lost millions in sales. First-year Commissioner Kevin Warren was the main target, criticized for a lack of communication and not providing enough information to back the initial decision.
 “We have passionate athletes. We have passionate families and we have passionate fans,” Warren said of the blowback. “And so I take that from a positive standpoint.”
 The Big Ten postponed fall sports just six days after unveiling a modified, conference-only schedule that was set to begin Labor Day weekend, and indicated it would try to make up the season in the spring.
 But there was no plan in place and the reaction was sharp. Trump at one point called Warren, who described their conversation as “productive” and “respectful.”

Sizemore said the county has identified the Public Works Building, which they plan to vacate in the near future, as a potential location for a childcare facility. He said Ken Templeton, a project engineer with the Public Works team, has reviewed requirements to convert it and has drawn up a rough plan for what it could take to meet necessary code estimating renovations at $400,000. Sizemore explained that this award is a planning grant and that “it most importantly means we will have a solid first step in getting the idea to fruition.”
 The Childcare Committee will work with WAGAP, which will act as the fiscal sponsor, to administer the grant. Their focus is particularly on families at risk and historically underserved populations, in addition to working families. Families at risk may include those at or below the poverty line or may have a single-parent household. Goldendale poverty is listed at 13.5 percent (1) which is above both the County at 12.7 percent (1) and State at 10.30 percent (2) and higher yet is the Yakama Nation at 22 percent (3) which borders the community and whose residents could also benefit from new childcare options.
 Penny Andress, KVH nurse care manager and a co-founder of the committee, noted that development will take time.
 “Realizing the goal of a facility is still a couple of years away and families are in need of childcare now more than ever, especially with COVID-19 restrictions on in-person attendance at schools, we are excited to begin facilitating a training program that would help bridge the gap between individuals and the Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF) Division of Licensing to get in-home care options up and running as soon as possible," she said.
 The next step for the committee will be to reconvene and prepare to hire a project lead by October. They will also be outlining steps for developing partner agreements, conducting a feasibility study, and sourcing additional grant funds to begin construction on a new childcare center. Anyone interested in learning more about this effort may reach out to Washington Gorge Action Programs at 509-493-2662 or info@wagap.org.
