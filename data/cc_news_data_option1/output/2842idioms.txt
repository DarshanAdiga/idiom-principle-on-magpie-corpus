VICTORVILLE -- One person was killed and three others, including two children, were taken to the hospital after a traffic collision here Friday, authorities said.
   
 The driver of a silver Honda Accord was pronounced dead at the scene, and two children passengers were taken to a trauma center. The driver of a white Nissan Altima was taken to a local hospital.
   
 An update on the victims' conditions, the severity of their injuries and the identity of the deceased person were not immediately available Saturday.
   
 San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department officials said in a statement that deputies and medical personnel responded to the crash just after 5:40 p.m. Friday near Village Drive and Eto Camino Road.
   
 Authorities shut down a stretch of Village Drive for several hours as investigators processed the scene for evidence and interviewed witnesses.
   
 Deputies learned the Honda was traveling west on Eto Camino Road and attempted to make a left turn onto Village Drive, "in the path" of the oncoming Nissan. Authorities said the Nissan hit the front driver's side door of the Honda.
   
 The investigation is ongoing and authorities are asking anyone who witnessed the crash to contact the Sheriff's Victorville station at 760-241-2911.

TOKYO, July 20 (Reuters) - Campaigners for Japan's nightlife workers say they need realistic guidelines for how to stay safe and remain in business amid the novel coronavirus, which has seen the government zero in on host and hostess bars as centres of contagion.
 Bar staff need practical rules on how to interact with customers, said Shinya Iwamuro, a urologist and public health advocate who has been teaching infection control measures in Tokyo's Shinjuku district and other nightspots.
 That means no kissing, no sharing plates and conversation should be at right angles to avoid droplet contamination.
 "As much as possible, kiss only with your partner, and avoid deep kissing," Iwamuro told a news conference, outlining what he described as "kiss etiquette".
 Strategic testing in the nightlife districts of Tokyo has revealed rising daily cases of coronavirus, predominantly among people in their 20s and 30s. The clusters prompted the Tokyo governor to raise the city's alert to the highest "red" level on July 15.
 With cases in Tokyo nearing 300 a day late last week, officials excluded people travelling to and from the capital from a multibillion dollar government campaign aimed at reviving domestic tourism.
 The government is also considering toughening its special measures act that allows it to declare a state of emergency. Media reported Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga as saying there may be more spot checks of nightlife businesses.
 But concern has grown that nightlife has become a scapegoat for the failure of authorities to track and contain the disease.
 Masayuki Saijo, director of virology at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said it was not appropriate to discriminate against people based on where or when they work.
 "There's no difference, working at night or working in the day," Saijo said. "The strategy to reduce human-to-human infection is the same."
 The host and hostess scene provides a kind of safety net for many Japanese seeking work, particularly single mothers, said Kaori Kohga, representative director of the Nightlife Business Association.
 More than a million people are estimated to work in the industry, she said.
 Her group has drafted its own safety rules for its members, including disinfecting karaoke microphones, as it found government recommendations, such as wearing masks and two-metre social distancing, were impractical, she told reporters.
 "Nothing will change if you're only criticising us as the bad guys," Kohga said, adding the government hadn't acknowledged their rules nor offered enough financial help to businesses or workers.

MARSHFIELD -- Marshfield is one step closer to turning its second capped landfill into an 5.6-megawatt solar power station after an approval by the zoning board of appeals.
 The project, built in conjunction with a private developer, No Fossil Fuels, will save the town $21 million over 20 years, Town Administrator Michael Maresco said.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to PatriotLedger.com to sign up for alerts and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 "It's huge for taxpayers," he said. "It's tantamount to an override for $1 million every year."
 The zoning board of appeals approved the variance for the capped landfill at its July 14 meeting, Maresco said.
 The solar power station will generate energy credits for the town toward its total electricity use, part of the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target Program, also referred to as SMART, he said.
 "This is the best use for a capped landfill," Maresco said. "We went out to market, put together a plan, asked companies to give us their best plan of what can be built."
 The solar panels are buffered already, produce no noise or smell and did not result in a single tree being cut down, he said.
 "It's perfect for the environment," he said.
 The town selected No Fossil Fuel to construct the solar array. One of the complications with a capped landfill is how to keep it on the ground, since the ground is also the cap and cannot be punctured, Maresco said.
 The solar panels will go into cement shoes that sit on top of the ground, he said.
 "The selectmen asked me to get involved in green technology," Maresco said. "I've done that."
 The new power station has been in the works for just over a year and included writing a power purchase agreement and payment in lieu of taxes agreement, which required the town to hire an attorney who specializes in power agreements.
 "It took a couple of months to iron out the details," he said.
 Maresco said he expects the new power station will start generating energy by next summer.
 Town energy consultant Matt Parent said the solar panels will take up 10 to 12 acres of the 20-acre site.
 "It will take up the whole landfill cap," he said.
 Parent said he is looking at other town-owned facilities to increase the total solar footprint to 10 to 14 megawatts. The town is building a new police station and a new Department of Public Works facility.
 "The best tax credits are on town-owned property," he said.
 Another capped landfill, across the street, is already the site of a 4-megawatt solar array. It started providing energy in 2014.
 Scituate placed solar panels on its capped landfill in 2013 and Braintree did the same in 2014, as did Cohasset in 2017. Rockland also has a similar facility.

 The Gunners have endured a seesaw 2019-20 season, including a change of head coach following Unai Emery's departure in November, but have shown promising signs in recent weeks under Arteta.
 After victory over Premier League champions Liverpool in midweek, Arsenal recorded an impressive 2-0 triumph against Manchester City in Saturday's FA Cup semi-final, raising the possibility of not just a trophy but also a Europa League spot.
 The two results have clearly demonstrated the progress made under the Spaniard, who feels the club's standing on and off the field should make them an attractive option for any player.
 "I've said it before that I do not think we should bring in players who need a lot of convincing," Arteta told the media. "This club has enough to be attracted to it.

Parents have found themselves in the same position as school districts this summer -- tasked with preparing for a seemingly endless list of possibilities for the restart of school.
   
 Diana McIntyre is like many other parents. The possibility of sending her 4-year-old daughter Rinnah and 6-year-old son Roy back to school comes with a few concerns.
   
 Roy will be a first grader at Britton Deerfield this fall. Rinnah is set to begin kindergarten readiness through the Lenawee Intermediate School District. Both have individualized education programs (IEPs), which are special education programs tailored to each.
   
 McIntyre worries about her children adapting to new safety measures such as masks and social distancing.
   
 Roy can wear a mask, no issues, according to his mother. She also said he can repeat back to her concepts about keeping one's space, but she worries if it truly clicks, given he's only 6 years old.
   
 Roy's IEP focuses on his social skills. McIntyre said some of the progress he made "came crashing down" when schools shut down as he would physically and verbally lash out.
   
 "My son understands it, but he still finds it frustrating he can't do some of the things he loves to do," she said.
   
 Masks are a little more challenging with Rinnah who considers them a fashion accessory, often wearing them on her head.
   
 Schools are working on developing reopening plans based on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's Return to School Roadmap which details requirements and recommendations for in-person instruction.
   
 Lenawee County is under Phase 4 of the Michigan Safe Start Plan. Students, staff and bus drivers at Phase 4 schools are required to wear masks during school transportation. Teachers must wears masks at all times. Masks are required for all in hallways and other common areas.
   
 Students in grades six through twelve are required to wear masks in classrooms. This is not a requirement of younger students.
   
 School districts are also required to work with their local health department, especially in the event of a positive COVID-19 test.
   
 Mark Haag, superintendent of the Lenawee Intermediate School District, said districts also have "some local latitude" when crafting their plans. There is an effort locally to have plans be consistent with one another.
   
 "We think for a lot of reasons … it makes sense to be as consistent as possible," he said.
   
 Haag said most talks he's had with parents indicate a desire to return to in- person instruction.
   
 McIntyre would like to see her kids return to a traditional school setting, for more reasons than one.
   
 "I have mixed feelings as many parents do," she said. "I kind of need them to go back to in-person instruction because if they don't I can't work."
   
 McIntyre was thrown into the fire this spring when she was asked to be a homeschool teacher on the spot.
   
 It's not something she wants to revisit.
   
 "It was like being a fish out of water," McIntyre said. "You just flop around and try to survive … I tried my best."
   
 The mother of two said she tried to incorporate learning in everyday conversations with Rinnah and Roy, asking questions to get them thinking. McIntyre said Roy taught himself how to read.
   
 Haag said he expects districts to offer a virtual option for parents who don't feel comfortable sending their kids to school.
   
 "You really need to plan it in that direction anyway," he said.
   
 Whitmer's school restart plan recommends students and staff who are symptomatic to stay home until they test negative for COVID-19 or are released from isolation.
   
 The governor also recommends schools contact anyone who was in close contact with a diagnosed case of COVID-19 so they can quarantine for 14 days.
   
 McIntyre worries about another outbreak that would require online learning. The McIntyre family lives northeast of Tecumseh on Ridge Highway near the border of Washtenaw County.
   
 "The online option would be a nightmare," she said. "Our internet is garbage. Remote learning is not a good option for us at all."
   
 Online learning is expected to be more structured this school year. Incomplete work was not held against students last spring. A more structured program will put more pressure on parents in terms of internet access.
   
 McIntyre said their internet provider options are limited. There's satellite internet, but it's expensive.
   
 "The cost is a big no on my part," she said.
   
 Haag said schools must have their plans approved by Aug. 15.
   
 "I think it's safe to say most districts are going to have their plans … ready to go in the next couple weeks," he said.
   
 The more time parents can prepare, the better.
   
 McIntyre said she's willing to do whatever it takes, even if she has to be a homeschool teacher.
   
 "Whatever is asked of me, I'll do it," she said, "because that will get us closer to normalcy."

Mrs McLucas, from County Down, said that even putting a foot on the floor was extremely painful.
 "To try to do anything is sheer agony," she said.
 "You feel like throwing the covers over your head. My mental health has deteriorated.
 "I'm just getting into that big black hole."
 Mrs McLucas said her doctors were wonderful but the government needed to act on behalf of people like her.
 "Probably arthritis isn't seen as a major concern in the way that cancer is. The government needs to get waiting lists sorted out."
 Sara Graham, Northern Ireland director of Versus Arthritis told Good Morning Ulster that Mrs McLucas' situation was "far too common".
 "Even before Covid-19, Northern Ireland had the worst waiting times in any part of the UK not just for joint replacement surgery but also for other vital health services like physiotherapy and rheumatology," she said.
 "Over half will be waiting a year to get their first appointment to see a consultant for an assessment to go onto another waiting list and they could be waiting for years. Those are the stories we hear consistently."
 The charity has launched a campaign called "Impossible to Ignore". They are asking people to sign a petition to ask that arthritis be taken more seriously.
 "People are living with really debilitating, chronic pain . Nearly half a million people in Northern Ireland live with some kind of muscular skeletal condition," Ms Graham said.
 "Approximately half of those people were told to shield and had appointments and treatments cancelled.
 "They have been telling us that their physical and mental health has deteriorated as a result. We are asking government and health services to prioritise these people and to prioritise reducing these waiting lists"

Like all political prisoners, he was under strict surveillance. His access to news was regulated, his letters were censored, and interviews with visitors limited. But he never ceased to feel wonder for the small daily diversions of such a regimented life, relentlessly questioned authority and injustice, and wrote some of his most affecting poems in captivity.

MILFORD - Back in April, Sarah Enquist was laid off from her job at KO Sushi & Grill in Hopkinton - a business that is closed today as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Shortly afterward, she relapsed.
 "I felt like, 'OK, the world is ending, why not?'" said Enquist, 32, who has struggled with addiction since she was 14 or 15.
 "Right now it's really hard for people in recovery because of the isolation," she said. "There's a lot of people who have had years of recovery, and they're falling off. It's really important for us all to be together, because in recovery, you can't do it alone."
 It was support from others that helped Enquist, who served in the Army for six years fixing weapons, stay sober since her relapse. People she previously lived with at a halfway house reached out to her when they heard about it, and she received support from Lisa Trusas, a 911 dispatcher and recovery coach at Community Impact Inc. in Milford who had been looking out for Enquist before she stayed at the halfway house.
 Virtual meetings held by Community Impact, an organization that provides mental health support and services for those struggling with addiction or losing someone to it, has also helped Enquist feel less alone. But moving out of Milford in late May to live at a sober home in Worcester with about 20 other women means, at the very least, that she won't be physically alone.
 "If we're all quarantined, at least I'm surrounded by like-minded people," she said. "The easiest thing for an addict to do is to talk to another addict because some people just don't understand. We've all been there before. Someone who hasn't might not get it."
 She's been there since May 31. As of Saturday, Enquist is 74 days sober.
 Sitting at a picnic table in the parking lot of Community Impact on Saturday morning painting rocks with colorful words reading, "hope" and "breathe," Enquist said she hopes people who see the rocks feel less alone in a time where physical isolation can mean life or death. It can be one of the worst things for an addict to experience, she said.
 "I remembered something that a girl in recovery had told me: 'Hope stands for hold on, pain ends.' That's what got me back. That's why I made this rock," she said, showing a rock depicting a sunny day with clouds, and that same phrase.
 The event to paint these "recovery rocks" was the first one hosted by Community Impact for Chris' Corner to spread the message of recovery and addiction awareness. Chris' Corner, a new resource recovery center planned for downtown Milford, is named for Milford High graduate Christopher Swindell, who died of an overdose at age 29 on July 13, 2018.
    New Milford recovery center to be named for Chris Swindell  
 About 40 others joined Enquist in rock-painting on Saturday, with more than four dozen rocks dispersed throughout Milford over the weekend, including some at the soon-to-be Garden of Hope at Fino Field. On the back of every rock is the hashtag #RSNP, which refers to the "Regional Substance Navigation Program," where people can reach out to for help.
 For those struggling with addiction during the pandemic, Enquist recommends they seek help, whether it's moving into a supportive environment with others or sharing your struggle through a computer screen.
 "I think addicts and alcoholics are just a bunch of big empaths that feel all the weight of the whole world, and they can't handle it," she said. "I just wanted to be able to spread hope, because hope's the only thing that brought me back."
 As a result of the pandemic forcing people to reduce physical contact with one another, Community Impact has turned to telehealth, video conferencing and phone check-ins to make up for its usual face-to-face meetings. The number of people seeking help through those programs has spiked during the pandemic, jumping from 71 in April to 101 in June, said owner Amy Leone.
 But she's glad to see more people seeking help.
 This past week, she said the center reopened to help a few younger children who were struggling with telehealth, but the full return of everyone will be a slow and steady process. Despite striving to keep everyone safe, the reduced physical contact with others has affected many who are struggling with their addiction or someone else's, said Leone.
 "All of us know that if this was happening to us in our families, we wouldn't know what to do and we would need somebody like (the staff at Community Impact Inc.)," said Leone. "If (my son) was struggling with that disease, I would need somebody to help. Because I wouldn't know what to do."
 It's what Shannon Keaney did when her son Patrick started struggling with addiction after getting hurt playing lacrosse in college. He had been in and out of rehab, and wanted to recover after struggling for more than five years, said the Milford mother.
 When Patrick was 23, his parents found him a rehabilitation center to stay at for 11 months. He came home with a prescription for Vivitrol, an opioid- blocker to reduce his cravings.
 But insurance wouldn't cover its cost, said Keaney. Without insurance, one injection of Vivitrol costs about $1,400.
 Patrick's parents fought with the insurance company for months about it, until Patrick relapsed. On Feb. 18, 2017, Patrick died of a fentanyl overdose. He was 24.
 "I was his friend," said Keaney, calling him a "mama's boy."
 It's been three years since his death, and he's remained on Keaney's mind every day since. The social isolation brought on by the pandemic has heightened her feelings of loneliness, but said virtual meetings with Community Impact have helped her, along with an online support group she helps run called "Rise Up" that meets a few times a month.
 "Find a group," Keaney tells those who are struggling after losing a loved one to addiction and feel physically and emotionally isolated from the world. "Don't stay home and in bed. Get a support system - and they are out there."

NO es la primera vez que asoma por esta columna esta cuestion: los debates, reflexiones y discusiones que se generan a la salida del cole en el patio o en el parque. Son muchas horas sentados y sentadas en el banco, surgen todo tipo de temas y hay analistas de sobra para llenar varias tertulias. El que suscribe sigue teniendo la sensacion de que algo se esta perdiendo por no poder estar junto a sus hijos por las tardes, es la condena de trabajar en un periodico que se publica cada mañana y se termina de redactar un crepusculo tras otro. Y hay que reconocer que dan cierta envidia esas profesiones en las que se cuelga la chapa justo a tiempo para aprovechar las ultimas horas del dia. El caso es que recientemente, comentando con un compañero de la redaccion estas cuestiones, me vino a decir que gracias precisamente a no estar demasiado tiempo en el parque nos librabamos de tener que preocuparnos de gilipolleces. De esas historias para no dormir que reflejan a partes iguales la capacidad de los padres y madres de preocuparse por todo lo que concierne a su descendencia y lo facil que es malinterpretar todo aquello en lo que uno no es experto. Ese axioma que apunta a que todo aficionado al futbol se cree que es un entrenador en potencia, tiene una replica en lo relativo a las necesidades y la proteccion de nuestros hijos. Y a veces nos olvidamos de que el crecimiento tambien pasa por caerse en el parque para aprender a levantarse en la vida.
