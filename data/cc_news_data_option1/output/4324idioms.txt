L’attuale contesto economico ha reso il lavoro sempre più precario. Molti lavoratori sono infatti costretti ad una costante incertezza, passando continuamente da un contratto a termine ad un altro. I lavori sono spesso inframezzati da periodi di disoccupazione. Insomma, le incertezze lavorative negli ultimi anni sono diventate un problema per tutti. In un recente approfondimento abbiamo visto che anche i contratti a tempo indeterminato possono diventare a termine. In molti casi, poi, è necessario svolgere la propria attività in maniera autonoma, rinunciando alle tutele previste per il lavoro subordinato. Una di queste tutele è la NASpI, ossia il sussidio che l’INPS paga alle persone prive di occupazione. Questi periodi di inattività sono solitamente dedicati alla ricerca di un nuovo impiego, o alla definizione della propria futura professione autonoma. In questo articolo capiremo come aprire la partita Iva conservando la NASpI e cosa è necessario tenere sempre in mente.

 Despite suggesting the old “What if we’re all hallucinating from something those masked guys put in the air vents?” option, it’s clear well before that what kind of story this is. A lot of reviews seem to argue that the movie isn’t trying to hold back the reveal that the four horsemen and our four protagonists are one and the same, which is a point I’d be more inclined to grant if the film then didn’t treat the late-in-the-game reveal as some massive rug-pull. As horror fans, we’re used to having to defensively justify our fondness for a genre that was long considered disreputable (not so much these days, happily), so while I can understand trying to find value in the film’s semi-distasteful use of the real-life tragedy of school shootings (it’s put to cheap and exploitive ends, not thoughtful ones—this isn’t _Elephant_ ), the result falls well short of compelling.  
 Still, it’s not without its moments of eerie potency. After having largely dismissed the film, the next day I found myself remembering with a shudder a scene in which Louis enters the women’s bathroom to look for his girlfriend, Emily. (Another strike against the movie: It’s one of those stories where the four “friends” not only don’t seem to have anything in common, but they interact like people who have never even spoken to one another before, let alone like people close enough to plan and execute an exhaustively rehearsed school shooting together.) As he wanders past the decaying stalls, a pair of writhing CGI creatures occupy them, just outside his sightline. It’s not exactly great effects, but something about it obviously worked, because I’m still dwelling on that moment.

ST. CLAIRSVILLE, Ohio (AP) — Robert Murray, the board chairman of the largest privately owned U.S. coal operator, who long fought federal regulations to reduce black lung disease, died at his home in Ohio less than a week after announcing his retirement, a lawyer said.Michael Shaheen, an attorney who had recently represented Murray, 80, told The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register that he died Sunday morning in St. Clairsville.No official cause of death was given. Public reports recently stated Murray had applied for black lung benefits with the U.S. Department of Labor. The application said Murray was heavily dependent on oxygen.Murray had announced his retirement Oct. 19 from American Consolidated Natural Resource Holdings Inc., which is based in St. Clairsville. The company has active mines in Alabama, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Utah. Murray was the founder, president and CEO of the company’s predecessor, Murray Energy.Murray Energy was launched in 1988. The company recently emerged from federal bankruptcy protection, with its Chapter 11 plan becoming effective last month.“Bob fought through his medical challenges with the same energy, drive, guts, and faith in God as he approached everything in life,” Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said in a statement. Murray was a friend for three decades, DeWine said.Murray had fought federal mine safety regulations for years, with his company suing unsuccessfully in 2014 over regulations to cut the amount of coal dust in mines to reduce the incidence of black lung disease.Shaheen said a private memorial service for Murray was scheduled for Tuesday.“Saddened to learn of the passing of Bob Murray,” tweeted U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican. “He was a staunch ally for coal miners, a good friend, and a one of a kind person.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Lehmans brought along River, a 9-year-old Chessie with plenty of seasons under her collar. Ochoa brought Kimber, the 18-month-old granddaughter of River who is just learning the waterfowling ropes.
 Known for their thick-haired coats and cold-water prowess at retrieving waterfowl, the task of these Chessies breaking ice to fetch any birds that dropped wasn’t an issue here.
 “It’s like what they live for,’’ Ochoa noted as she tried to calm an excited Kimber before the hunt.
 Last season, and the one before, this spot was a mallard magnet, spurring limits of ducks on many days, Chuck Lehman noted before he and Ochoa broke ice to put out the decoys. But that’s when the river was up over its banks, with flooded lowlands all around, and the ducks were coming for acorns. This summer’s drought left most of the bottomlands high and dry, the river low and narrower, and the ducks haven’t come. At least not in any great numbers. Not yet.

Three Peoples Democratic Party leaders have quit the party saying that Mehbooba Mufti’s statements “hurt patriotic sentiments”, NDTV reported on Monday. The three leaders are TS Bajwa, Ved Mahajan and Hussain A Waffa.


  In a letter to party chief Mufti, the leaders said they were “feeling quite uncomfortable over some of her actions and undesirable utterances especially which hurt patriotic sentiments”.


  On October 23, Mufti had said that her party would bring back the state flag and not abandon the battle for special status for Jammu and Kashmir. “My flag is this,” Mufti had remarked, pointing to the Jammu and Kashmir flag. “When this flag comes back, we’ll raise that flag [Indian tricolour] too.”


  She had added: “Until we get our own flag back, we won’t raise any other flag...This flag forged our relationship with that flag.”


  The PDP chief had also criticised the revocation of Article 370 and said that Parliament had no power to take it away. “A robber may be mighty, but he has to return the stolen goods,” she said, adding that this “dictatorship” will not go on for long. Hours after her comments, the Bharatiya Janata Party had called Mufti’s remarks “seditious” and said that she should be “put behind bars”.


  On October 24, the state unit of the BJP filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India, seeking that Mufti’s party be derecognised. On the same day, a group of unidentified men forcibly hoisted the Indian tricolour at the Jammu office of the PDP. Party leader Firdous Tak claimed that a “few right wingers” attacked him and another leader Parvez Waffa who were present at the office.


  Union Minister of Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Sunday that Mufti’s comments were “downright denunciation” of the sanctity of the country’s flag. He also asserted that Article 370 will not be restored as it was revoked following a proper constitutional process and both Houses of Parliament approved it with overwhelming numbers.


  National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Sunday poured scorn on Prasad for claiming Article 370 of the Indian Constitution will be never restored, asking him not to presume what the Supreme Court would decide of the matter. However, he did not comment on the Mufti’s remarks. The Congress too chose not to toe Mufti’s line on the matter. Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress chief Ghulam Ahmad Mir said that Mufti’s statement does not match with the party’s political line. “People from all parts of J&K are upset about the unconstitutional manner in which changes were brought to the character of the former state, but in politics, you have to say that politically,” he added.


  Mufti was on October 13 released from her over one-year detention under the Public Safety Act. She had been in detention since August 5, 2019, the day the Centre abolished the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, bifurcated it into two Union Territories, and imposed a lockdown.


  Almost all of the Kashmir Valley’s political leadership, including two other former chief ministers – Farooq Abdullah, his son Omar Abdullah – were detained last year. Omar Abdullah was released seven months later on March 24 as the Jammu and Kashmir administration revoked his detention order under the Public Safety Act. Farooq Abdullah was released on March 13. People’s Conference chief Sajjad Lone was released in July.

The South Korean official disappeared near the island of Yeinpyeong, where he was patrolling the area, on September 21\. The following day, he was found at sea by North Korean security forces, who shot him in the water, according to the South Korean authorities. Seoul said that the official's body was burned. However, the North denied doing so and stated that only his "floating material" was set afire in accordance with anti-coronavirus measures adopted by Pyongyang.
 According to Pyongyang's statement, the North Korean security forces found an individual at sea and asked him to identify himself. The man only answered that he was from the South and refused to speak further. The North's soldiers fired two warning shots, after which the man tried to escape, forcing the North Korean border guards to shoot and kill the intruder.

While much of the nation watches rapt on election night to see who wins where, what will Idahoans have to watch?
 Idaho, by and large, is commonly regarded as a baked-in done deal: If an “R” rather than a “D” is attached to the name, then—with some exceptions, as in the city of Boise and a few other places—that candidate will win. The Republican for president, for Senate, for legislature and so on. For example, the FiveThirtyEight website, one of the most careful numbers analysts around, never assigns 100 percent probability to almost anything but does put (dryly) the likelihood of a Donald Trump presidential win in the Gem State at more than 99 percent.
 That’s not quite the end of the story. In cases like Idaho, and other places—this applies to both parties—part of the story is in, not just who wins, but by how much, and where. These details have their own stories to tell.

Jose Mourinho has said his free-scoring Tottenham Hotspur side still have a long way to go in match the attacking threat of the celebrated Real Madrid team he guided to La Liga glory.
 Spurs have scored 31 goals in their last nine games in all competitions ahead of Monday’s trip to Burnley in the Premier League, with England star Harry Kane and South Korea’s Son Heung-min both in fine form this season.
 Yet even that glut is overshadowed by the 121 goals that Real managed when winning La Liga in 2011/12 under the guidance of the much-travelled Mourinho, also a title-winning manager in his native Portugal with Porto, in England with Chelsea and in Italy with Inter Milan.
 At the Bernabeu, Mourinho had the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain to call upon up front in addition to a solid defensive unit.
 But Tottenham, who were last crowned champions of England nearly fifty years ago, have been unusually profligate for a Mourinho team which they demonstrated while letting slip a 3-0 lead in the final 10 minutes of an extraordinary 3-3 draw with London rivals West Ham last week.
 “In Real Madrid, I had amazing, amazing attacking players and we managed to build the team in a certain way,” Mourinho said.
 “I have to be honest and say we have lots of good attacking players here but we need to give stability to the team because the team needs stability in the back to feel solid, confident – to (be able to) have a go,” he added with Spurs currently a modest 11th in the Premier League table.
 “So we need to find that balance... Behind, we need to improve in some details – that’s obvious.”
 Mourinho was criticised for being overly defensive during his time in charge of Manchester United and in his first season at Spurs.
 But he insisted tactics were conditioned by the players at his disposal, saying: “Depends on the team. They cannot say that about my Real Madrid team that scored 121 goals in the league. If they say that about the way to finish second with Manchester United or last season to try to get a way to finish top six and to be in the Europa League, I think they are right.”

That’s not to say there haven’t been challenges. Year after year, the resort segment’s performance is strongest in March and July and weakest in September and December. This held true after 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis, but COVID-19 disrupted this pattern. March should have been the first peak month of 2020 for resorts, but the global pandemic had other plans. Instead of strong numbers, resorts saw a steep drop in performance starting in March of this year. Over the last 20 years, March occupancies in the resorts segment have held at over 60 percent. In 2020, March occupancy plummeted to 37.9 percent with a RevPAR of only $70.60. Over the last several years, occupancy for March has been above 70 percent with a RevPAR in the mid-one-hundreds. Revenue dropped 54.5 percent year-over-year (YOY). But resorts did not hit rock bottom in March; performance worsened in April, hitting a record-breaking low of 13.7 percent occupancy with a RevPAR of just $12.17 and revenue dropping 94.8 percent YOY. April 2020 was the lowest-performing month for the resorts segment of the past 20 years, but after hitting the bottom, things can only go up. July, the other peak month for resorts, had an occupancy of 44.7 percent and RevPAR of $76.20, which is not great, but was a much-needed improvement over April. Revenue declined 56.2 percent YOY, but is slowly-but- surely rebounding.

"Across our channels and regions our brand portfolio is working hard to return to pre-COVID levels of growth and we have made progress in the quarter," he said adding that “local champions" such as Thums Up in India saw growth in the third quarter.
 Not surprisingly, the total beverage maker is making all out effort to reach pre-COVID levels on the back of local offerings such Thums Up.
 The brand was introduced in India at the time of Coke's departure in 1977. It was bought by Coca-Cola India in 1993, after it made the re-entry into the country post economic liberalisation.
 Under its hyper-local strategy, the beverage major has launched several products including 'Spiced Buttermilk', under its dairy brand 'VIO'.
 The company intends to gain more market share in India by developing region- specific localised products that suit the majority's palate.
 Consequently, the company has ramped up its focus on product innovation with an aim to build a localised consumer-centric portfolio."
 Besides introducing desi brands, the company has increased its use of regional languages and platforms to market products.
 Recently, West Bengal became the first Indian state where the entire portfolio and marketing initiatives of Coca-Cola's brands have been hyper-localised with the use of Bengali language.
 In terms of new segments, Coke India entered into the nascent immunity- boosting beverages category in India.
 Accordingly, the company under its master brand Minute Maid, introduced two new products which claim to deliver some of the daily essential nutrition requirements, extracted from fruits grown by the Indian farmers.
 Furthermore, the beverage major is expected to complete the earlier announced $5 billion investment this year for creation of retail infrastructure, bottling plants and introduction of new products, amongst others.
 Since its re-entry into India in 1993 till 2011, Coca-Cola had invested US$ 2 billion in the country.
 Additionally, the company has committed an investment of US$ 1.7 billion towards creating a 'Fruit Circular Economy' to aid the Indian agri-ecosystem till 2023.
 At present, the company offers a range of beverages, including Coca-Cola, <a

Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare cancer that forms in the bile duct. It is classified based on its anatomical origin: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) occurs in the bile duct inside the liver and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma occurs in the bile duct outside the liver. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma are often diagnosed at a late or advanced stage when the prognosis is poor.1,2 The incidence of cholangiocarcinoma varies regionally and ranges between 0.3-3.4 per 100,000 in North America and Europe.1 FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements occur almost exclusively in iCCA, where they are observed in 10-16% of patients.3-5,1 FGFRs play an important role in tumor cell proliferation and survival, migration and angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels). Activating fusions, rearrangements, translocations and gene amplifications in FGFRs are closely correlated with the development of various cancers.

CAPE TOWN, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Cricket South Africa's (CSA) entire board has resigned, the organisation said on Monday, with an interim committee likely to be tasked with bringing the governing body out of its administrative turmoil.
 A day after five members, including acting president Beresford Williams, stepped down CSA said its other board members have also resigned.
 "...the Members' Council had deliberated and resolved that in order to best serve the interest of cricket in South Africa, the entire Board should resign - which they did," CSA said in a tweet.
 "All independent and non-independent directors have now resigned."
 CSA has been battling governance issues with a damning internal report providing a long list of concerns about the actions of various staff members.
 Sports minister Nathi Mthethwa told the International Cricket Council (ICC) this month that he intended to intervene in the running of CSA unless it committed to governance reforms by Oct. 27.

 ON BOARD JS KAGA, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Japan and the United States on Monday began air, sea and land exercises around Japan in a show of force in the face of increased Chinese military activity in the region.
 The Keen Sword exercise is the first big drill since Yoshihide Suga became Japan's prime minister last month with a vow to continue the military build-up aimed at countering China, which claims Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea.
 Keen Sword, which is held every two years, involves dozens of warships, hundreds of aircraft and 46,000 soldiers, sailors and marines from Japan and the United States. Running until to Nov. 5 it will include cyber and electronic warfare training for the first time. "The security situation around Japan has become increasingly severe. This gives us the opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the Japan-U.S. alliance," General Koji Yamazaki, Japan's top military commander said on board the Kaga helicopter carrier in waters south of Japan.
 Japan's biggest warship was accompanied by U.S. aircraft carrier the USS Ronald Reagan and its escort destroyers. The 248 metre (814 ft) Kaga, which was returning from patrols in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, will be refitted as early as next year to carry F-35 stealth fighters.
 Suga this month visited Vietnam and Indonesia as part of Japan's efforts to bolster ties with key Southeast Asian allies. That followed a meeting in Tokyo of the "Quad", an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States that Washington sees as a bulwark against China's growing regional influence. Beijing as denounced it as a "mini-NATO" aimed at containing it.
 Japan has grown particularly concerned about an uptick in Chinese naval activity around the disputed islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo claims as the Senkaku and Diaoyu in Beijing.
 Accompanying Gen Yamazaki on the Kaga, Lieutenant General Kevin Schneider, commander of U.S. Forces Japan pointed to recent activity by China that worried Washington and Tokyo, including new security laws in Hong Kong that had undermined the territory's autonomy, China's military build up in the South China Sea and harassment of Taiwan by the Chinese military over the past few months.
 China has said it intentions in the region are peaceful. (Reporting by Tim Kelly Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

It’s rare to say this about a horror film, but “pretentious” is an apt term. The movie is straining for depth and symbolism is doesn’t earn. It believes it contains rich mythology by dint of including the myth of Ammit, an ancient Egyptian monster who devoured dead souls unworthy of immortality, and applying little flourishes like having the kids dress up as the four horsemen of the apocalypse—death, famine, pestilence, and war—to lend it a heady intellectual air. How does it apply those concepts? By oh-so-subtly having its educator named “Persephone” and by having Mouse just explain to the others, out of nowhere, the history of Ammit, so that when it appears later in fully rendered CGI, we can think, “Oh. Ammit, right?” It is never used outside of that. It’s pure window dressing, meant to tart up a thunderingly pedestrian script where characters who are literally confronting undead monsters for the first time in their lives don’t freak out, but instead say things like, “Stop it, or I’ll kill you for real.”

Livestock are combined with opportunistic cropping. In most years, crops produce little, sometimes failing completely; but once in a while there is a bumper crop, and grain is stored for years and investments are made. In the five years for which cropping data is reported in this paper there was one year where farmers produced on average around two tonnes of grain per household. In most years, the total was below what is sufficient to provide for a family, and farming had to be complemented with off-farm income. Again, the experiences from past years echo through the years.
