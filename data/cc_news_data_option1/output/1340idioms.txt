(AP) – In a rare address to the nation, Queen Elizabeth II plans to exhort Britons to rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic, drawing on wisdom from her decades as Britain’s head of state to urge discipline and resolve in a time of crisis.The 93-year-old monarch is expected to acknowledge the suffering that many families have experienced because of the COVID-19 crisis, which has infected over 42,000 citizens in the U.K. and killed at least 4,313 of them. She will seek to lift spirits and offer hope to the country in its hour of need."I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,'' she said, according to excerpts released ahead of remarks that were being broadcast Sunday night. "A time of disruption in the life of our country; a disruption that has brought grief to some, financial difficulties to many and enormous changes to the daily lives of us all."The queen gives yearly Christmas messages but has given an address like this on only three previous occasions. She delivered speeches after the Queen Mother's death in 2002, before the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales in 1997, and at the time of the first Gulf War in 1991. The queen will laud Britain's beloved National Health Service and others in essential services, together with some 750,000 people who volunteered to help the vulnerable. "I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge," she said. "Those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.'' "That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet, good-humored resolve, and of fellow feeling still characterize this country," she said, according to excerpts. The crisis has hit close to home for the queen. Her son and the heir to the throne, 71-year-old Prince Charles, had a mild case of the disease. She herself left London, the epicenter of Britain's outbreak, and took up residence at her home in Windsor with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.Both the monarch and her 98-year-old husband are among those over 70 whom the British government have advised to stay home for 12 weeks.The address was recorded at in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle. The location was chosen specifically because it allowed enough space between the monarch and the camera person, who wore personal protective equipment.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

A couple from Kerala settled in the US are waiting eagerly for easing of COVID-19 lockdown curbs on travel to rush home and hold and cuddle their baby girl born out of surrogacy in a hospital in the southern state. The couple, hailing from Pathanamthitta district and settled in the US, have been waiting for nearly 12 years to have a child and had planned to arrive in Kerala early last month in time for the delivery on March 19, but the coronavirus spread the world over has played spoilsport. The parents of the child are in the US. They were supposed to come and receive the baby, but unfortunately due to the sudden lockdown, they are still having to wait, Dr Parasuram Gopinath, Consultant and Scientific Director of Centre for Infertility, Management and Assisted Reproduction (CIMAR), a fertility centre in Kochi, where the baby was born, said. They had a first look at their baby through video chat. The couple have been trying to have a child for the past 10-12 years. They have had multiple treatment failures. Ultimately, through surrogacy they have got a child of their own, Parasuram told. The parents, who underwent treatment at CIMAR, had returned to the US and were hoping to be back in Kerala by March 9 but could not make it. The baby, born on March 19, is perfectly fine, Dr Parasuram said, adding that she was well taken care of in the neo-natal ICU (NICU) of the hospital for 12 days. Asked how the parents reacted on first seeing their bundle of joy, the doctor said they were overjoyed and extremely happy. The parents were waiting for so long to have a child. But thanks to technology we could show them the child through video. Every day, the NICU staff would send them the babys pictures also, he said. The neo-natal ICU doctors and nurses took good care of the baby, he added. The hospital authorities also spoke to some of the relatives of the couple in Kochi as there is uncertainty on when the lockdown was likely to be lifted. The hospital authorities took a legal opinion and on the advice of an advocate decided to draw up an affidavit signed by both the parents and a voice mail of the couple was also prepared before handing over the baby to their close relative on April 3, Dr Parasuram said. The relatives were also told the step by step process of how to feed the baby, wrap and hold her, he said.

Since then, additional states and communities across the country began implementing mandatory stay-at-home orders (and other social distancing measures, including school closures, many of which began state-wide on March 16, and closing non-essential businesses). But, with conflicting messages from the federal government and a lack of clear guidelines, states have not been on the same page, and implementation has been scattershot at best. In some cases, contiguous states have had different policies (such as South Carolina, which has no mandate and North Carolina which does). Moreover, in some states (including those with rapidly rising caseloads), Governors resisted issuing state-wide orders, leaving decisions up to local jurisdictions, creating confusion and concern and prompting calls from local officials and public health experts for state-wide action. This was the case, for example, in Florida, Georgia, and Texas until recently and remains so in a handful of other states. It's hard to see how a highly infectious virus is going to pay very close attention to different policies across states, let alone within them. Indeed, new data shows that there was more travel in counties without such orders.

Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said that the committee tasked with probing the sugar and wheat crisis has made some "serious relevations" which need to be probed.      He demanded that action be taken against those who profited from the sugar and wheat crisis, based on the findings contained in the   report, which was made public yesterday.
 "This report is a charge sheet against Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar," he said.
 Sharif said that the coming days will reveal what punishment the prime minister -- who is also the chairman of the Economic Coordination Committee -- will decide for himself and his chief minister "over such a massive scale of corruption and nepotism".
 Meanwhile, the government's chief spokesperson, Firdous Ashiq Awan, in a media briefing in Sialkot, said that Sharif need not act all high and mighty over the report.
 "This report has also mentioned a Rs1.4 billion subsidy given to Suleman Shehbaz," she said, referring to Shehbaz Sharif's son.
 She said that the current government had provided Rs3bn in subsidies whereas the past government had provided subsidies worth Rs22bn.
 "Let's see when Shehbaz Sharif calls his dutiful son over from London for punishment."
 Suleman, in his defence, has claimed that the Rs1.4bn figure "is a lie concocted by Imran Khan and his cronies".
 He has shared a screenshot of year-on-year allocation of subsidy to sugar exports, showing a little over Rs330 million in subsidy from 2014-2018 and no subsidy for 2018-19.
 ## Report's broad findings
 An inquiry committee constituted by Prime Minister Imran Khan to investigate the sugar and wheat crisis has held the federal and Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments responsible.
 The report by the three-member committee has named, among other prominent figures, top PTI members.
 According to the report, which surfaced yesterday, Jahangir Khan Tareen (JKT), Makhdoom Omer Shehryar Khan (brother of Khusro Bakhtiar) and his partners Chaudhry Munir and Chaudhry Moonis Elahi are the major beneficiaries of sugar export subsidy and price hike.
 The committee has revealed that maximum benefit of export was drawn by JDW Group (Jahangir Khan Tareen) by availing itself of 22% of total subsidy of Rs561 million.
 Similarly, second highest beneficiary was the RYK Group run by Makhdoom Omer Shehryar Khan availing itself of 18% of subsidy of Rs452 million. The Group owners also include Chaudhry Munir and Moonis Elahi. The third highest was Shamim Ahmed Khan (Al Moiz Group) availing itself of 16% of subsidy of Rs406 million.
 The committee in its findings has also included data on subsidy given for the last 5 years to the tune of around Rs25 billion, 3 billion out of which was given the previous year.
 According to the consolidated data, RYK Group has been the largest beneficiary with total subsidy of 4 billion, JDW with over Rs3 billion, Hunza Group with Rs2.8 billion, Fatima Group with 2.3 billion, Sharif Group with Rs1.4 billion and Omni with Rs901 million.

The rate of doubling of COVID-19 cases in India is at present 4.1 days but if the cases linked to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation would not have happened, it would have been 7.4 days, the Health Ministry said on Sunday. "If the Tablighi Jamaat incident had not taken place and we compare the rate of doubling - that is in how many days the cases have doubled, we will see that currently it is about 4.1 days (including Jamaat cases) and if the incident had not taken place and additional cases had not come then the doubling rate would have been around 7.4 days," Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said.
 Agarwal said 472 new COVID-19 cases and 11 deaths have been reported since Saturday. The total coronavirus cases stand at 3,374 and the death toll is now 79. He said 267 people have recovered. However, a PTI tally of figures reported by states directly showed at least 106 deaths, while the number of confirmed cases had reached 3,624. Of the total, 284 have been cured and discharged.
 There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the numbers announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states. On the shortage of personal protective equipment, Agarwal told reporters at the briefing that the government has started the procurement of PPEs from other countries too.
 "Parallelly around the world wherever the PPE is available we have started procurement from them too. The good news is that a number of philanthropic organisations are making efforts to enhance our supplies. We have dispatched materials also. Even today, in a video conference, we asked states to rationally use PPE so that no shortage arises," he said. Clarifying whether coronavirus is airborne or not, an ICMR official said at the briefing, "We need to understand that in science whoever does experiments some will have a 'for opinion and some against' but we need to take a balanced, evidence-based approach." "For example, if it was an air-borne infection then in a family whoever has a contact they all should come positive because they are living in same surrounding as the patient and the family is breathing the same air. When someone is admitted in hospital, other patient would have got exposure (if it was air borne) but that is not the case," said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at ICMR.
 On the question of rapid antibody test, Gangakhedkar said test kits should be available by Wednesday. Agarwal said Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba held a meeting with district magistrates, superintendent of police, chief medical officers, state and district surveillance officers, state health secretaries and district health secretaries and chief secretaries on Sunday on COVID-19.
 District officials shared the strategies adopted by them to combat the pandemic like how they delineated containment and buffer zone, how they carried out door-to-door survey through special teams, how through telemedicine and call centres people who had come from outside were monitored. The districts from where many cases were reported like Agra, Bhilwada, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Pathan Mitha, East Delhi also shared their experiences and strategies.
 The main points that came out were proactive and ruthless containment implementation at field level and preparedness to the extent of being over prepared to handle cases at any stage, Agarwal said. All DMs were instructed that pharma units making devices and medicines must run seamlessly, he said.
 The district officials also shared how they monitored the elderly population of their areas through ring-fencing. They also shared their experience on how hospitals and hotels are being used as isolation facilities, Agarwal added. COVID cases have been reported in 274 districts and the cabinet secretary requested all DMs to maintain uniformity in their response and establish a crisis management plan, he said.
 "Yesterday, the prime minister held a meeting of the empowered committees and they briefed him about the actions taken by them at their level in relation to quarantine and isolation facilities, testing and critical training," Agarwal said. He said the Health Ministry has asked all chief secretaries and health secretaries to ensure all health professionals are made aware of the new insurance scheme implemented by the government.
 "The Health Ministry has also discussed about providing adequate supply of oxygen cylinders," he said. Agarwal said Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday visited AIIMS-Jhajjar. On Saturday, he visited LNJP hospital and before that he visited Safdarjung and RML hospitals in Delhi.
 AIIMS-Jhajjar will function as a dedicated COVID-19 hospital with 300 beds in isolation wards. "Under the National Rural Livelihood Mission, 65,000 people from 14,522 self-help groups in 399 districts of 24 states have started the process of manufacturing masks," Agarwal said.
 Moreover, in view of the lockdown to ensure that the supplies are not disturbed, the Indian Railways has done transportation through 2.5 lakh coal wagons and 17,700 petroleum products wagons, he said..
