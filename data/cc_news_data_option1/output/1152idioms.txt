Shares in the company have more than halved in the past two months as oil prices have continued to dive on the back of travel restrictions and tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
 Shell said its cost-cutting plans are expected to improve cash flow by between 8 billion and 9 billion dollars (£6.9 billion and £7.7 billion) before tax.
 The company board added that it will not go forward with the next stage of its share buyback programme.
 Chief executive Ben van Beurden said: "As well as protecting our staff and customers in this difficult time, we are also taking immediate steps to ensure the financial strength and resilience of our business.
 "The combination of steeply falling oil demand and rapidly increasing supply may be unique, but Shell has weathered market volatility many times in the past.
 "In these very tough conditions, I am very proud of our staff and contractors across the world for maintaining their focus on safe and reliable operations while also ensuring their own health and welfare and that of their families, communities and our customers."

Gold prices fell on Monday as investors stockpiled cash, with a rising numbers of coronavirus-led national lockdowns threatening to overshadow stimulus measures from global central banks to combat the pandemic's economic damage.
 Spot gold slipped 0.6% to $1,488.00 per ounce by 0825 GMT, after rising as much as 3.1% in the previous session on a wave of stimulus.
 U.S. gold futures climbed 0.5% to $1,491.50.
 "For the time being, gold is not serving as a safe-haven because of margin calls and panic. There is capital outflow from everywhere," said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice-president of commodity research at SMC Comtrade.
 "(Investors) are winding up their positions. It's not technical or fundamental - it's all panic."
 Asian shares sank as a rising tide of lockdowns threatened to overwhelm policymakers' frantic efforts to cushion what is likely to be a deep global recession.
 Another concern is the possibility of central banks having to sell gold to buy dollars as the greenback continues to strengthen, said Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at financial services firm AxiCorp.
 The dollar held near a three-year high against major currencies as fresh declines in global stocks and worries about tightening liquidity amid the worsening crisis accelerated the flight to cash.
 The U.S. Federal Reserve continued to roll out emergency support on Friday as it enhanced efforts with other major central banks to ease a global dollar- funding crunch.
 Market participants are counting on further policy easing in the next few days as the U.S. Senate mulls a $1 trillion package that would include direct financial help for Americans.
 Airlines canceled more flights as Australia and New Zealand advised against non-essential domestic travel, the United Arab Emirates halted flights for two weeks, and Singapore and Taiwan banned foreign transit passengers.
 Meanwhile, nearly one in three Americans were ordered to stay home to slow the spread of the disease, while Italy banned internal travel as deaths there reached 5,476 and China reported 46 new cases on Sunday that were mostly imported from overseas.
 The global death toll from the coronavirus exceeded over 14,000 with more than 300,000 infections.
 Spot gold is expected to retest a support at $1,452 per ounce, a break below which could cause a fall to $1,374, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.
 Among other precious metals, palladium inched up 0.2% to $1,644.99 per ounce, platinum shed 0.2% to $609.56 and silver slid 0.9% to $12.47.

The contingency plan includes going from a four-platoon to a two-platoon system and altering firefighters' work hours, which was tested several years ago.
 "You got 24 [hours] on, 24 hours [off]," he said. "If the manpower goes down enough, that's something..we'll have to put in place. And we're ready to do it. We understand. We took this job and during emergency situations, we might have to make sacrifices, and we're okay with that. We're just trying to make sure that if they do that emergency plan, is all of our engine companies going to be open? Or is it going to be less resources for the citizens, and less resources for the firefighters?"
 Leonetti Jr. wrote to the administration last week expressing concerns about the policy as well as a lack of cleaning supplies during the virus outbreak.
 "Our biggest concern--and it always is and always will be--is the continued use of rolling bypass," he said.
 Leonetti said he told the administration about a FEMA public assistance grant, under the Stafford Act, made possible through the federal emergency declaration, which frees up $40 billion to help combat the virus, and allows state and local governments to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of costs for emergency protective measures.
 "We're still down an engine company almost every day, so we've asked and pleaded with the mayor, the human resources director, and our fire chief to open our engine company. We want it every day, but especially right now," he said.
 He pointed to Washington D.C.'s fire department which took down two engine companies and led to the quarantine of 100 firefighters.
 "We only have 150 firefighters on he whole Wilmington Fire Department," he said. "I just think about what happens if an engine company in Wilmington gets exposed to that? Goes back to a station and exposes another company, and takes those two companies out of service, and we're already down an engine company, and then something happens?"
 Within a few days of receipt of the letter, the city sent over bleach, Lysol disinfectant, and Clorox bathroom cleaners. It did not address rolling bypass.
 "It's a step forward, it's not where we want to be, but it's a positive step," said Leonetti.
 In an email to WDEL, the city said there are no plans to change Wilmington Fire Department operations at this time.
 "Depending on the staffing shortage, the department would request mutual aid from the county volunteer fire organization," Fire Chief Michael Donohue.
 John Rago, the mayor's deputy chief of policy and communication, said the chief is in receipt of information about the grant.
 "We are awaiting more information about the grant in order to make a decision about applying for it," he told WDEL.
 In the meantime, firefighters are taking steps to ensure a contingency plan isn't necessary. They're conducting twice-daily cleanings of fire stations-- once in the morning and once at night--as opposed to the normal, single daily cleaning.

“I’ve been there and it can be done," he said.
 But after one year, some are skeptical of the out-of-town chief who hadn’t experienced the specific challenges in Baltimore.
 The Fraternal Order of Police president, Sgt. Mike Mancuso, has been an outspoken critic of Harrison. He says he fails to see any urgency from police command to address the violence.
 “There’s no new direction to the men and women in patrol in any given day. It’s very concerning from the union standpoint. That’s why we have been so vocal,” Mancuso said.
 The union president said he believes the department has not identified new strategies to get violent criminals off the street. If that were done, he said, crime would go down.
 As the number of homicides has remained high, homicide clearance rates have dwindled to just 32% — one of the lowest in decades.
 Past administrations held commanders accountable when crime went up in their district, Mancuso said. He complained that weekly Compstat meetings have lost that focus and include discussion over policy, recruitment and other issues.
 Andre Davis, the recently retired city solicitor who helped bring Harrison to Baltimore, said he believes the commissioner is faced with unprecedented circumstances but has demonstrated he can get the job done.
 “He has totally exceeded my expectations. He has been every bit as smart, steady, creative and patient. I think he has just done a fantastic job,” Davis said, adding that Harrison should be given another two years before his performance can be criticized.
 Harrison has not been given enough time to make any real impact on violence, which is deeply rooted in many other societal issues, Davis said.
 “We lock up black boys and black men and we send them back to the same community with no real opportunity to get decent work, so what we end up with is what we got," Davis said.
 For community members like McCormick, who have yet to feel any changes, Davis said change is coming from the consent decree. The former solicitor said the first two years on the job are focused largely on paperwork, meaning rewriting policies to meet requirements from Justice Department lawyers and national best practices.
 Now, he said, officers are beginning to train under those policies, such as when and how to use force, when to stop, search and arrest someone, and how to safely address individuals with mental health issues. Officers are also learning how to engage with the community in thoughtful ways.
 Rather than jumping out and arresting guys on the corner, officers will be expected to get out of their cars and talk to those men, Davis said.

Michael Novogratz (@novogratz) March 22, 2020 ETH/USD is teetering 2% higher on the day after growing from $122 (opening session) to trade at $124.87. Ethereum price bulls lack the energy to sustain gains above $125 let alone tackle the resistance at $130. For now, the best the bulls can do is to defend the support at $120 and focus on the levels at $125 and $130. XRP/USD, on the other hand,is trading at $0.1511 after adding 2.24% to its value on the day. An intraday high at $0.1524 forms the immediate resistance. If $0.15 continues to hold as support, the buyers will have the time to gather the strength to clear the next hurdle at $0.16. On the downside, $0.14 remains intact as major support.",

A senior executive of a leading shipping company said freights had risen as the industry looked to bridge the dent in business caused by the steep fall in shipments from China. "High cost of cleaner fuel and tighter allocation of space due to increase in consignments from India are among factors that led to an increase in freight charges in recent weeks," said the executive, who did not wish to be identified.

The precious items he took over 13 occasions up till Jan 20 this year included gold bangles, rings, pendants earrings and bracelets.
 He intended to use the money from pawning off the jewellery to gamble further and recoup gambling losses, pay off his debts and return to the pawn shop to redeem the jewellery.
 However, he realised on Jan 20 this year that he would not be able to redeem the items and had no choice but to come clean.
 He told Poh Heng's human resources manager about what he had done, and was fired from his job. A police report was filed and Poh Heng redeemed the jewellery for S$98,048.
 It also deducted a sum of about S$2,600 from Tan's salary in an attempt to recover their losses.
 District Judge Marvin Bay told Tan that he had "most egregiously abused the trust reposed by your company", where he had worked for 36 years.
 "You had used the proceeds to feed your gambling habit and in a helpless attempt to recoup your losses," said the judge.
 He said it was fortunate that Poh Heng was able to redeem the jewellery, but added that it suffered losses to its reputation.
 For each charge of criminal breach of trust, Tan could have been jailed for up to 15 years and fined.

"That means that businesses fundamentally cannot plan for disaster, or they fundamentally cannot do it given the mandatory way that businesses are run right now, because of the system that we set up for ourselves. This is just what it is. There's no other way to be competitive in the market, other than to chronically underpay the shit out of everybody, and cut and run when the going gets tough."
 Brammer says he would be floored if 75% of the restaurants that were closed would reopen following the coronavirus closures, and he believes the pandemic has led to a turning point in America. The system, he feels, is broken, and he wants to make sure that in the future, the industry is prepared for events like pandemics.
 While Brammer and Shift Dallas want to spearhead change in the hospitality industry, their main focus right now is providing service industry workers with the essentials.
 "We're 100% dedicated and committed to making sure that people have something to eat in this city," Brammer says. "We have always been committed to that. And just because we might not have jobs anymore doesn't mean that we stop."
