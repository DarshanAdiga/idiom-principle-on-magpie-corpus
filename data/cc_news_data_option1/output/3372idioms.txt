Senior Director of the Turkish Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Aykan Erdemir told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the prospects for profiting off the new gas field are unclear so far. The analyst noted that field experts are predicting that this process would take seven years. Despite the fact that it is too early to discuss the influence this could have on the Turkish-Russian relations, Ankara plans to use domestic production of gas in the long run to overcome dependency on Russian gas and negotiate a lower price, the expert pointed out. On the whole, Turkey will continue to import oil, gas and liquified natural gas for the next decade, however, it will have more space to maneuver between its key suppliers, including Azerbaijan, Russia and the US, Erdemir concluded.

_Roma, 26 ago 13:01 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- La ricollocazione dei 19 nuclei familiari ancora presenti nell'area F del campo rom di Castel Romano e il conseguente sgombero dello spazio, indicativamente previsto per il 10 settembre, dovrebbe slittare alla fine dello stesso mese. È quanto emerso stamattina nell'ambito della commissione Politiche sociali di Roma dove Valeria Franca Neri, rappresentante dell'ufficio Rom, sinti e camminanti del Campidoglio, ha fatto il punto sulla situazione. "Abbiamo inviato le lettere per comunicare ai nuclei familiari che entro il 10 settembre devono liberare l'abitazione - ha detto Neri - ma credo che i tempi non saranno completamente rispettati. Inizialmente nel campo i nuclei familiari erano 26, dopo l'incendio del giugno scorso alcuni sono usciti e si sono sistemati presso parenti o in altre situazioni. Ora abbiamo 19 nuclei familiari di cui quattro con situazioni di fragilità anche dal punto di vista sanitario. Riteniamo - ha aggiunto - che entro settembre questa cosa dovrà essere fatta". L'area F del campo, sottoposta a sequestro e che presenta problematiche per quanto riguarda la depurazione delle acque, è quella che va liberata al più presto "con la ricollocazione momentanea delle persone", ha precisato Neri. Dei 19 nuclei familiari "16 hanno già sottoscritto il patto per l'inclusione" con Roma Capitale "e ora si elaboreranno i progetti - ha sottolineato Neri -. Abbiamo le giovani coppie che sono più disponibili a inserirsi in formazione, ci sono molti patti per il ferro". Il progetto finale resta quello "della fuoriuscita di tutte le persone dal campo", ha concluso. Il progetto per l'inclusione lavorativa delle persone su Castel Romano, affidato a tre realtà associative, ha avuto inizio a febbraio scorso e scade nel giugno 2022.

Adds further comments from governor, details)
 By Ann Maria Shibu
 Aug 24 (Reuters) - A police officer shot a Black man in the back multiple times in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday, a bystander's video appeared to show, prompting a night of unrest during which protesters hurled firebombs at law enforcement officers.
 The victim, identified as 29-year-old Jacob Blake, was taken to a hospital in serious condition after the shooting late Sunday afternoon.
 Crowds gathered at the scene, set fires and threw bricks and Molotov cocktails at police, prompting authorities to impose a curfew. On Monday morning Kenosha County announced on Twitter that its courthouse and administration building would be closed due to damage caused during the previous night's unrest.
 A video circulating widely on social media showed Blake walking toward a car followed by two officers and one of them shooting him as he opens the car door.
 The incident followed nationwide protests this summer over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
 "Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight," Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."
 Social media posts showed crowds marching down streets of Kenosha, a city of around 100,000 people on Lake Michigan about 65 miles (100 km) north of Chicago.
 The shooting occurred around 5 p.m. as officers were responding to what they termed a "domestic incident." The victim was immediately taken to a hospital by the police, according to a Kenosha Police Department statement. No further explanation was given by the police as to what led to the shooting.
 Officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, the Wisconsin Department of Justice said early on Monday.
 The state's Division of Criminal Investigation said it would work to issue a report to prosecutors within 30 days.
 "We're tired of it. ... We're tired of it," Clyde McLemore, identified by a local Kenosha television station as a member of a nearby chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement, said at the scene. "The frustration is boiling to the top, and we're sick and tired." (Reporting by Ann Maria Shibu in Bengaluru and Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Jonathan Oatis)

In a prior article (see here), we had argued that India&amp;rsquo;s Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework places immense faith on an unproven ability of the policy repo rate to control CPI inflation, in our borrow-to- produce economy. It side-steps the impact of interest rates in areas such as the external sector, savings and investment. It focuses on the policy repo rate alone, ignoring other tools such as liquidity conditions, the term structure of interest rates, foreign currency intervention, and macroprudential regulations.On the positive side, it offers simplicity and predictability that particularly appeal to foreign investors. In addition, it might also serve as a carrot-and-stick to nudge the government to control food prices and its fiscal balance, in exchange for lower interest rates.In this sequel, we consider a more holistic monetary policy assessment in the current context, encompassing inflation, external balance, savings and financial stability.InflationWith a double-digit GDP contraction likely in FY21, India is seeing a severe demand shock. However, amidst rising government fiscal deficits and strong foreign currency inflows, money supply M3 is growing at a healthy 12.7 percent per annum, despite credit growth struggling at just 5.5 percent per annum.Despite the slump in economic activity, CPI inflation and inflation expectations are elevated, likely on the back of supply bottlenecks. Nevertheless, when the pandemic subsides and the velocity of money limps back to pre-COVID-19 levels, the substantial overhang of M3 alongside the shift in terms of trade to the rural sector could pose inflation risks.There is record excess capacity in the system currently. However, Chart 1 shows that a spike in M3 and consumption can lead to high net import of goods and services, and high inflation. We have historically struggled to match our consumption growth with domestic output and jobs.Should M3 growth be curtailed now, by restricting one of credit growth, government deficits or foreign currency inflows? Credit growth is already at historical lows amidst fear and trust deficits. Suppressing this further with higher interest rates would make little sense. Government deficits, fuelled by tax shortfalls, are unlikely to react to monetary signals. Finally, as we shall see in the next section, opportunistic foreign currency inflows can paradoxically be curtailed by reducing short-term INR interest rates and increasing INR liquidity.Eventually, if and when credit offtake and consumption pick up, domestic supply, inflation and net imports will bear watching closely. If the real sector ensures that supply, jobs and investment exceed the increase in consumption, a virtuous cycle can perpetuate. If instead supply falls short and inflation sets in, braking of M3 growth may become necessary.External Balance Interest rates, currency markets and capital flows are deeply interlinked, via what economists refer to as the &amp;lsquo;impossible trinity&amp;rsquo;. One manifestation of this is the &amp;lsquo;carry trade&amp;rsquo;.Under &amp;lsquo;carry trades&amp;rsquo;, investors opportunistically switch from foreign currency assets to INR assets (or from INR loans to foreign currency loans), betting that interest gains would more than compensate for any INR depreciation. Examples of implicit carry trades include short term foreign portfolio investments into INR debt, repatriable INR deposits by NRIs, ECB borrowers leaving their currency risk unhedged, and exporters and offshore speculators selling forward foreign currency against INR. INR interest rates play a key role in determining the attractiveness of the carry trade.Chart 2 maps the estimated &amp;lsquo;carry&amp;rsquo; flows over time, alongside the more &amp;lsquo;permanent&amp;rsquo; external flows&amp;mdash;which we define as the sum of current account balance, foreign direct investments and foreign portfolio investments in equity. The chart shows that carry-linked flows often overwhelm permanent flows. In fact, almost the entire net $200 billion currency intervention purchase by the RBI over the period can be attributed to net carry-influenced flows.Over the past fifteen years, India&amp;rsquo;s net imports of goods and services have averaged 5.7 percent of consumption. As a self-correcting mechanism, besides real sector responses, INR should have adjusted down, helping shift the terms of trade towards domestic output and jobs. However, a wall of opportunistic carry inflows, influenced by India&amp;rsquo;s interest rates, has prevented a timely and adequate currency adjustment.Let us now consider the current context. Permanent foreign currency flows could settle at a record USD 65 bn in FY21, with consumption and imports collapsing, even as FDI and FPI equity flows sustain. However, it is too early to call this trend durable. In fact, permanent surpluses will likely come down sharply over the next few years, as consumption limps back to normal. In the meantime, we remain a net importer of goods and services.&amp;nbsp; As such, excessive INR appreciation now could impair India&amp;rsquo;s terms of trade and domestic industry.Against this backdrop, India cannot afford to carry trade inflows now&amp;mdash;both from the appreciation pressure on INR, and the growth in M3. In fact, now is the time to encourage a reversal of the carry trade. This in turn calls for very low short-end INR rates and high INR liquidity.In addition, the current context strongly argues against RBI purchasing foreign currency in the forward markets. Such intervention keeps forward premia high, and can in turn encourage even more carry trades. In Q1 of FY21, RBI purchased $8 billion in the forward markets, with a view to avoid immediate INR liquidity injection. As a result, the implied INR rate in the USDINR 1-year forward premia is currently 0.8 percent higher than 1-year INR CD rates. It would have been far better to restrict currency intervention to the spot market, allow forward premia to fall, and hence encourage a reversal of the carry trade.Savers, Borrowers and Financial StabilityWhile controlling M3, restricting INR appreciation, and providing interest relief to stressed borrowers call for low short-term interest rates and high rupee liquidity, that does short-change savers.After all, with inflation expectations now firmly in double-digits, and considerable uncertainty around medium-term inflation, average bank deposit rates of 6.00 percent offer very negative real interest rates, particularly when adjusted for tax. It is no surprise that some savers are moving away from term deposits into equity markets and gold. This increases financial stability risks of an asset bubble or increasing wealth disparity.One way to address this would be to reduce financial repression and ensure that the government pays the appropriate price at the longer end, commensurate with the large size of its fiscal borrowing. There is little long-term borrowing by the commercial sector towards investment at this point, and therefore the issue of crowding out should not immediately arise. Most existing banking commercial debt is anyway repriced within the year, and hence are more linked to short term rates rather than the longer end.A steep curve&amp;mdash;low short end rates and high longer end rates&amp;mdash;should help optimise across the interests of commercial borrowers and savers while offering some control on currency markets and inflation. The cost for this curve would be borne by the entity borrowing the most, and with most control over the future of our economy&amp;mdash;the government. Financial repression by way of excessive long-term OMO purchases and operation twists would hurt savers, and cause money to flow into speculative asset markets.Putting It Together&amp;mdash;An Alternative MPC PrescriptionWhile inflation is elevated now, given already record low commercial credit growth, higher interest rates would not be appropriate at this stage to control money supply M3 growth.On the contrary, short end rates need to be kept low (aided by high INR liquidity), so as to encourage a reduction in carry-trade foreign currency positions, reduce pressure on INR appreciation, and reduce M3 growth from foreign currency inflows.The RBI should not purchase foreign currency in the forward market. That keeps forward premia elevated and incentivizes further opportunistic foreign currency carry-trade inflows.To protect the interest of savers, and to restrict wholesale diversion of savings from fixed income to riskier asset classes, financial repression should be minimised, and the government should pay the fair price to fund its long-term borrowings.In summary, a steep interest rate curve&amp;mdash;low short-end rates and high long-end rates&amp;mdash;might best optimise across managing inflation, our external balance, the interest of savers and borrowers, and financial stability.As and when economic activity reverts to some normalcy, given the overhang of high M3, consumption and credit growth will bear watching closely. At that stage, if imports and inflation start to rise uncomfortably, rates may have to be nudged upwards to control credit and M3 growth. On the other hand, if the real sector responds with increased domestic output and jobs, a virtuous cycle of credit growth, consumption, supply, jobs, savings and investment can sustain for a long time.&amp;mdash;Ananth Narayan is Associate Professor-Finance at SPJIMR.

Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH) shares on Tuesday's trading session, jumped 0.28 percent to see the stock exchange hands at $179.57 per unit. Lets a quick look at company’s past reported and future predictions of growth using the EPS Growth. EPS growth is a percentage change in standardized earnings per share over the trailing-twelve-month period to the current year- end. The company posted a value of $3.67 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $15.58 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is -7.70% and predicted to reach at 8.57% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 7.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 8.44% for the next five year.

Felker, the volatile and visionary publisher, became her mentor and lover. They dated off and on for more than a decade before marrying in 1984. Felker, who died in 2008, was the “love of her life,” she would later write. She credited their bond in part to lessons she had absorbed from “Passages.” She had been willing to leave him, if only to prove she could manage alone.

The traditions that we share and the memories that are made when we observe these traditions are what truly keeps us coming back. The person that says they disapprove of hunting would never understand, but it is so much more than just dragging animals out of the woods. Gathering with other hunters, in a camp setting, is a time honored tradition that most of us look forward to all year.
 It’s time for you to go to hunting camp. I know that you have been thinking about it and maybe you need to do some things to get ready. This year why don’t you go all out and go to camp early, before your big trip, and do those fourteen little chores that you need to do before all of your entourage shows up.
 Across the country, hunting camps can take many forms and this too is part of the tradition. A camp can be anything from a group of tents set up on National Forest land, a tar paper shanty that your Dad and your uncles built 50 years ago, to a full blown Shangri-La with multiple bunk rooms, power and water and a deck with a Jacuzzi on it. It doesn’t really matter what form the camp takes, it’s hunting camp, and you are there to revel in this world for whatever time that you may have.
 The most important facet of hunting camp is also one of the biggest traditions, and that of course is food. Most hunters don’t care if the weather really stinks and the bucks are scarce as long as the food in camp is good and there is a lot of it. Vast quantities of good vittles is what many camps are famous for.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Greece on Wednesday not to test his country’s patience or courage, further stoking tensions between the NATO allies over offshore energy exploration in the eastern Mediterranean.
 Erdogan’s tough words came despite mediation efforts by Germany, whose foreign minister conducted shuttle diplomacy between Athens and Ankara a day earlier in a bid to deescalate the situation as Turkey and Greece engaged in competing military exercises at sea.
 The neighboring countries are locked in an acrimonious dispute over maritime boundaries and offshore energy rights. They have sent warships to shadow each other in the eastern Mediterranean and held military exercises within a broad area between Crete and Cyprus where Turkey has a vessel conducting drilling research.
 “Turkey will take what is its right in the Mediterranean, in the Aegean and in the Black Sea,” Erdogan said. “Just as we have no eyes over anyone’s territory, sovereignty and interests, we will never compromise on what belongs to us. We are determined to do whatever is necessary in political, economic and military terms.

The governor on Tuesday also called on the Republican-controlled legislature to pass a limit on campaign donations.
 Pennsylvania is facing a massive budget shortfall after months of business shutdowns and stay-at-home orders, with the state expected to lose $5 billion in revenue through next June. To buy time, the General Assembly passed a stopgap budget this spring, along with a $2.6 billion package that used federal dollars to assist struggling nursing homes, people facing eviction, and business owners.
 Pennsylvania is still sitting on $1 billion provided through the federal CARES Act, as legislative leaders wait to see if Congress will pass another relief bill or give states more flexibility to spend the dollars on lost tax revenue. Lawmakers are expected to face bleak decisions when they return to finish the budget.
 At a press event Tuesday, Wolf called for “common-sense reforms” that he said should focus on supporting families, workers, and businesses. That includes policy changes like expanding paid parental leave to all workers.
 “House and Senate Democrats have been fighting for these things for years, and certainly since the beginning of the pandemic,” Wolf said. “They’ve been stopped at every turn by the Republicans who’ve been focused on ignoring the public health crisis and actually trashing me. That has to stop. We’ve got to get back to doing things that actually matter to people.”
 Wolf and GOP leaders have repeatedly found themselves at odds over the administration’s response to the pandemic, including the temporary closure of businesses statewide and current restrictions on restaurants, salons, and entertainment venues. That tension has led to a few court battles, including one over a resolution to force Wolf to end the state’s disaster declaration. The state Supreme Court ultimately sided with Wolf, though Republicans are still seeking to undermine the governor’s emergency powers.

Adds reaction from other parties, background)
 By Steve Scherer
 OTTAWA, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Canada's main opposition Conservative Party on Monday elected Erin O'Toole, a former cabinet minister and armed forces veteran, to be its new leader and the primary challenger to Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
 O'Toole replaces Andrew Scheer, who failed to unseat Trudeau in an election last year. The right-of-center party struggled in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 59% of seats in the House of Commons.
 O'Toole beat out the better known Peter MacKay, who co-founded the party in 2003 and was a high-profile member of former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government, and two other candidates.
 While there is no vote looming, Trudeau needs the support of at least one of three opposition parties to stay in power, and a crucial confidence vote on the government's COVID-19 economic recovery plan is expected in late September.
 "The Conservative Party will be ready for the next election and we will win the next election," O'Toole said in his acceptance speech, delivered early in the morning after hours of technical delays.
 O'Toole, a 47-year-old father of two, describes himself as a "true blue Conservative" and has vowed to "put Canada first" while helping families and the economy recover from the coronavirus crisis.
 The Liberals quickly accused O'Toole of "wanting to take Canada backward".
 This, it said in a statement to supporters, "would mean making harmful cuts to services that Canadians count on, rolling back our work to fight climate change, weakening Canada's gun control laws, and much more".
 Trudeau will face at least two confidence votes this year but looks set to survive with support from the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP).
 Support for the Liberals surged as the government spent hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency aid during the pandemic, but they have lost ground in recent weeks amid an ethics scandal involving Trudeau and his former finance minister, Bill Morneau.
 Liberals would get 36.4% of the votes if an election were held today, while the Conservatives would win 29.9%, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp's (CBC) poll tracker, an aggregate of recent surveys.
 One of O'Toole's challenges will be to lure back voters in urban centers such as Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, which were Liberal strongholds in the past two national elections.
 "And the winner is Justin Trudeau," tweeted Karl Belanger, the NDP's former national director.
 O'Toole promised to defund the CBC, the public broadcaster, crack down on crime and cut taxes.
 In his speech, O'Toole reached out to left-leaning voters, saying there was room for them in the party.
 The son of a retired Ontario politician, O'Toole was first elected in 2012 and served as veterans affairs minister from February to November 2015.
 He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force at 18, working as a helicopter navigator before transferring to the Canadian Forces reserves. He then trained and practiced as a lawyer. (Reporting by Steve Scherer; Editing by Robert Birsel, Clarence Fernandez and Paul Simao)

On Tuesday, Wolf called on lawmakers to use the remaining $1 billion in federal money to help businesses purchase personal protective equipment, boost pay for frontline workers, fund education options for students of all ages, and provide relief to families unable to pay utility bills or rent.
 Wolf said he hopes an additional $90 million could be generated by revenue from legalized recreational marijuana to further fund pandemic-related relief efforts for small businesses. After years of saying Pennsylvania was not ready for recreational cannabis, the governor backed legalization for the first time in September 2019.
 Those proposals were coupled with calls for long-stalled government accountability reforms like further checks on gifts to elected officials and a limit on campaign donations.
 “We’re the Wild West in Pennsylvania,” Wolf said. “We need to actually rein that in.”
 Republicans in the Capitol, who are expected to return to Harrisburg in the coming weeks, said they are not on board with the governor’s plan.
 House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff (R., Centre) called the governor’s pitch “unaffordable” and blamed the administration’s “unilateral mandates” for causing economic harm. Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman called the plan a “press release” and claimed Wolf has not “held a call with legislative leaders since July.”
 “Instead, he sends out a political document and takes partisan shots at elected officials,” Corman said.

Existe una impresionante cantidad de textos dedicados a esta pandemia que nos tiene un día preocupados y el otro también; hay artículos editoriales, académicos, científicos, de recomendaciones y sugerencias, informativos y, por supuesto, aquéllos que no aportan la más mínima cosa, pero también hay ironías en el tema.
 Me voy a tomar la libertad de extraer algunas líneas de un interesante texto, irónico por naturaleza, que llegó a mis manos, pero desconozco el autor. Así que si alguien determina quién lo escribió, ofrezco en mi próxima colaboración darle el crédito. Ya avisé.
 Se refiere al Covid-19 como el virus más misterioso que ha existido y tan peligroso que se contagia de inmediato, pero tarda 14 días en incubar; luego se muere con jabón. “Es increíble cómo desaparece si hay grandes agrupaciones de personas haciendo saqueos o en manifestaciones públicas, pero si vas al cine, a un concierto o a un evento deportivo te atacará con toda su furia.
 “Si vas a una tienda de ropa se te pega, pero nunca dentro de los supermercados. Ahí en las compras no se contagia al lado de todo mundo en los pasillos, pero tienes que ponerte a dos metros de distancia para entrar.
 “Si compras en una tienda de pueblo o en un restaurante, se te pega, pero en las grandes firmas comerciales, tiendas de conveniencia con fama mundial, ahí no corres riesgo. El virus observa tus compras, paso a paso y te va siguiendo para que hagas lo que él indica; puedes comprar todo el papel higiénico que quieras, pero nada más una cartera de huevos. Compra todo el jabón que busques, pero solamente una sopa instantánea.
 “Es impresionante cómo se contagia en las pesas, en las máquinas de hacer ejercicio, en los balones de futbol y basquetbol, pero no sobrevive en los carritos del supermercado. El virus aparece en los consultorios de los dentistas, en las salas de estética, pero no se te pega en los cajeros automáticos de los bancos, ni en las máquinas de juegos de azar.
 “Este virus es tan inteligente que no molesta a las primeras 10 personas reunidas en un lugar, pero si eres el número 11 te contagias. Así que cuenta bien cuánta gente hay en un lugar antes de entrar. El virus es tan, pero tan inteligente, que si vas solo en tu coche te contagia, pero no pasa nada si vas en transporte público.
 “Si vas a la playa el virus se entera y te persigue, pero en las casetas de peaje el virus no se queda en las monedas ni en los billetes y ni en los guantes de los que cobran. Este inteligente virus sabe lo que quieres y lo que necesitas: si buscas cortarte el cabello o pintarte las uñas en un salón, ni la máscara te va a ayudar, pero si necesitas un fontanero porque se tapó el baño de tanto papel higiénico que compraste, el virus se debilita y la máscara logra protegerte.
 “Su peligrosidad aumenta después de la medianoche, así que los negocios tienen que cerrar. El virus se enoja mucho los viernes por la tarde y así dura hasta las seis de la mañana del lunes cuando hay que ir a trabajar. Es todo un misterioso dilema que tiene a los científicos de todo el mundo ocupados y confundidos, porque ya no es solamente un virus mortal, sino en extremo inteligente. ¿Qué virus tan extraño no?”. Fin del texto citado.
 Me parece que el texto no tiene mayores interpretaciones y no busco, al reproducir algunas de esas ideas, fomentar absolutamente nada contra nada ni nadie. Es sólo que me pareció algo distinto a todo lo que se ha escrito y como yo sólo escribo cosas comunes, le sugiero que nos cuidemos con mayor intensidad contra este virus.

Adds details on Port Arthur ordering evacuation, comments by Houston officials)
 By Jonathan Allen and Brad Brooks
 Aug 24 (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Laura is forecast to gain strength rapidly as it moves into the Gulf of Mexico late Monday, and is expected to become a hurricane before hitting the Texas or Louisiana coast within 48 hours, forecasters said.
 Residents along the U.S. Gulf Coast prepared for what could be deadly winds, rains, and storm surges.
 Laura comes on the heels of Tropical Storm Marco, which weakened sooner than expected. The rare threat of two possible hurricanes in the Gulf at once, however, took nearly 10% of the United States' crude oil production offline, as energy companies shuttered operations to ride out the weather.
 The National Hurricane Center warned that potentially deadly storm surges could hit from San Luis Pass, Texas, to Ocean Springs, Mississippi, in the next two days.
 The mayor of Port Arthur, Texas, an oil town of 54,000 people 85 miles (137 km) east of Houston, issued a mandatory evacuation, giving residents until 6 a.m. on Tuesday to leave. Several other cities asked for voluntary evacuations.
 Lina Hidalgo, the chief executive of Harris County, which includes Houston, urged residents to be prepared and not "to get cocky" by failing to prepare for the worst.
 "We're leaving no stone unturned with our preparation. Now it is your turn," Hidalgo told a news conference.
 Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner at the same news conference urged residents to prepare, though he added Laura was not expected to stall over the region and dump as much rain as Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which led to deadly flooding.
 HOWLING WINDS
 Laura traced the southern coast of Cuba on Monday, but the brunt of the storm was offshore, helping the largest island nation in the Caribbean avoid serious damage after Laura killed at least 10 people in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
 The storm downed trees in Cuba, ripped away flimsy roofs and caused minor flooding on Sunday evening, according to residents and news reports. In Jamaica, there were reports of landslides and flooded roads.
 "I slept well last night, except when the wind howled," Nuris Lopez, a hairdresser, said by telephone from a town in the foothills of the Sierra Maestra mountains in Cuba's eastern Granma province.
 Laura was heading toward the Gulf of Mexico at 20 miles per hour (31 kilometers per hour), according to the NHC. By Tuesday, it was expected to have reached hurricane strength. By Wednesday night, stronger still, it was expected to hit the U.S. Gulf Coast, the NHC said.
 By then, it could be a Category 2 or 3 hurricane on the 5-step Saffir-Simpson scale for measuring hurricane intensity, said Chris Kerr, a meteorologist at DTN, an energy, agriculture and weather data provider.
 OIL HIT HARD
 Despite Marco's weakening, with the NHC predicting it would slow to a tropical depression by Monday night, that storm still threatened to soak the Louisiana coast.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent teams to operations centers in Louisiana and Texas.
 This year's hurricane season has been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, forcing many people to weigh the risks of leaving their homes and potentially exposing themselves to the virus.
 Officials in Louisiana said that testing for COVID-19 was suspended in the state on Monday and Tuesday.
 Energy companies moved to cut production at U.S. Gulf Coast oil refineries after shutting half the area's offshore crude oil output as back-to-back storms took aim at the coast.
 Producers have shut more than 1 million barrels per day of Gulf Coast offshore oil production, 9% of the nation's total output, facing a storm that is forecast to become a damaging Category 2 hurricane.

Adds Congress decision, paragraphs 1-7)
 By Alasdair Pal and Rupam Jain
 NEW DELHI, Aug 24 (Reuters) - India's main opposition Congress party on Monday rejected a request from its leader, Sonia Gandhi, that she be allowed to step down, after a rare challenge to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has dominated the party for seven decades.
 Earlier on Monday, the Italian-born widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had offered to resign as interim leader after almost two dozen senior figures called for better decision-making in the party, which has ruled India for much of its post-colonial history.
 Her request was rejected by the party's top decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee, which wants Gandhi and her son, Rahul, to remain in control.
 "The CWC, reflecting the overwhelming view and desire of the rank and file of the Congress, unanimously resolved to strengthen the hands of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in every possible way," K.C. Venugopal, a Congress lawmaker, told a news conference.
 Prime Minster Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has dealt the Congress heavy defeats at the last two general elections, leading to disquiet in some sections of the party.
 The Congress now controls just a handful of India's 28 states, and the BJP has a comfortable majority in the national parliament.
 The party meeting came after 23 senior Congress figures wrote a letter calling for better leadership of the party, two sources said - taken by many as a thinly veiled criticism of the Gandhi family.
 The sources said the signatories to the letter wanted the Gandhi family to either play a pro-active role or step down, adding that more than 300 regional Congress politicians also supported the letter.
 In the capital, New Delhi, Gandhi family supporters held placards and shouted slogans outside party headquarters.
 Sonia Gandhi took over de facto leadership of the party last year from Rahul. His father, grandmother and great-grandfather were prime ministers of India.

BAKERSFIELD, Calif., Aug. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today International Fruit Genetics (IFG) launched a new variety of logos to inspire consumers to come back -- again and again -- for more of the grapes they have come to know and love. The new bold and vibrant designs were created based on licensee and retailer requests to provide more tools for creating interest and attention on the store shelf with a consistent and unified look for IFG breed brands.
 These visually appealing logos tell the IFG brand story and help consumers easily recognize the various grape varieties. When consumers recognize the new logos on the shelf, they can expect fresh, flavorful, and delicious grapes.
 “As more 52-week table grape supply programs are in place, unified designs and brand recognition will help suppliers and marketers provide retailers more opportunity to drive sales. IFG continues to invest in our varieties and trademarks and offer these logos for packaging artwork on bags, wraps and labels,” explains Andy Higgins, CEO of IFG.
 IFG is bringing to life the varieties in a preapproved way and assisting in making marketing efforts more effective and profitable. The new logos and packaging artwork will be provided to IFG licensed growers and marketers as part of an ongoing investment to enhance the consumer experience. The provided names with supporting graphics can be mixed and matched and will also include sample artwork for packaging. The creation of these logos and artwork also simplifies the approval process for IFG and trademark use as licensed growers and marketers save time and money by adopting these IFG compliant designs.

Adds company saying service restored, updates share price)

 Aug 24 (Reuters) - Video-conferencing company Zoom Video Communications Inc said on Monday it had restored service to its U.S. users after a partial outage left many unable to log in to work meetings or attend school classes remotely.
 The San Jose, California-based company has experienced a surge in usage during the coronavirus pandemic, as millions of people turn to it for work meetings, school, social events including weddings and to otherwise stay connected while isolating themselves. Many schools that turned to remote instruction have used Zoom for classes.
 Outage tracking website Downdetector.com showed nearly 17,000 incidents of people reporting issues with Zoom earlier in the day.
 "We have resolved the issue causing users to be unable to start and join Zoom Meetings and Webinars. Users are now also able to sign up for paid accounts, upgrade, and manage their service on the Zoom website. We are currently monitoring to ensure that these services are operational," Zoom said on its website. (https://bit.ly/3aR1Fly)
 The company did not provide details on the cause of outage.
 Zoom's stock has risen more than eight-fold since its initial public offering last year and four-fold so far in 2020, but it was down 2.9% after falling as much as 5.4% in earlier Monday.
 Zoom competes with Cisco Systems Inc's Webex, Microsoft Corp's Teams and Alphabet Inc's Google Meet platform for paying customers, particularly enterprises, while offering a free version to customers.
 Zoom had 300 million daily meeting participants in April, the latest figures disclosed.
 Even as its usage has soared, Zoom has come under fire over privacy and security issues, including incidents of "Zoom bombing" in which uninvited users entered and disrupted meetings. It has since rolled out major upgrades, including end-to-end encryption for video calls.
 Although a California company, Zoom has big research and development centers in China with hundreds of employees, according to a filing it made to the U.S. government.
 "For sustained growth to continue, it (Zoom) will have to show investors that it can be relied on to ensure its core customers don't drift towards the likes of Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Cisco's Webex," said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets commentator at Hargreaves Lansdown.
 "As Zoom fatigue sets in and the pandemic eases, it's even more important that the company demonstrates its systems are secure, if it's to be seen as a long- term player in this competitive market," Streeter added.
 Users took to Twitter to complain about the outage.
 "Zoom having a world wide outage for the first day of school, so 2020!" Twitter user Anthony Slaughter wrote.

Adds attorney assertion that Blake was first shot with taser)
 By Ann Maria Shibu
 Aug 24 (Reuters) - Police shot a Black man in the back multiple times in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as his three sons watched on Sunday, his family's lawyer said, sparking a night of unrest during which protesters hurled firebombs and bricks at law enforcement officers.
 The victim, identified as 29-year-old Jacob Blake, was taken to a hospital in serious condition after the shooting late Sunday afternoon. Blake's father told NBC News on Monday that his son was out of surgery and in stable condition.
 A video circulating on social media showed Blake walking toward the driver's side of a gray SUV followed by two officers with their guns drawn at his back. Seven gunshot sounds can be heard as Blake, who appears to be unarmed, opens the car door.
 It was unknown whether the officer saw something inside the vehicle to justify deadly force. It was also not clear whether one or both officers fired their weapons.
 Crowds gathered at the scene, set fires and threw bricks and Molotov cocktails at police, prompting authorities to impose a curfew. On Monday morning Kenosha County announced on Twitter that its courthouse and administration building would be closed due to damage from the night's unrest.
 The incident occurred three months after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year- old Black man, in Minneapolis police custody sparked nationwide protests against police brutality and structural racism in the United States.
 "Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight," Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. "While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."
 Social media posts showed crowds marching on Sunday evening down streets in Kenosha, a city of around 100,000 people on Lake Michigan about 65 miles (100 km) north of Chicago.
 Clyde McLemore, a member of a nearby chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement, said he was helping organize a protest at noon CDT (1700 GMT) on Monday that would walk from Blake's house to the courthouse and police station about 2-1/2 miles (4 km) away in Kenosha.
 Whitney Cabal, one of the leaders of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Kenosha who is also known by her social media name Billy Violet, said her group has staged protests following two other incidents of police use of force in recent weeks and has been dissatisfied with the police response.
 "This city is not going to stop burning itself down until they (protesters) know that this officer has been fired," she said. "There was no reason for seven shots to be fired into this man's back while he had three kids in the car."
 The shooting occurred around 5 p.m. as officers were responding to what they termed a "domestic incident." The victim was immediately taken to a hospital by the police, according to a Kenosha Police Department statement. No further explanation was given by the police as to what led to the shooting.
 Prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who said he had been retained by the Blake family and who has represented George Floyd's family, said in a statement that Blake had been trying to de-escalate a domestic incident when the officers first shot him with a taser gun.
 "As he was walking away to check on his children, police fired their weapons several times into his back at point blank range. Blake's three sons were only a few feet away and witnessed police shoot their father," Crump said.
 The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, the Wisconsin Department of Justice said early on Monday. Officers are routinely placed on leave after a shooting involving law enforcement until an investigation has been completed.
 The state's Division of Criminal Investigation said it would work to issue a report to prosecutors within 30 days. (Reporting by Ann Maria Shibu in Bengaluru, Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut and Daneil Trotta; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Jonathan Oatis)

It is a hard sell on a confusing topic - the thrust involves telling Americans that higher inflation will be good for them in the long run - and analysts have already begun second-guessing whether a new Fed "framework" will fare any better than the current one in an environment where monetary policy may be nearing the limit of what it can do to help the economy.
 "The situation is really perilous right now and there is little that monetary policymakers at this point have left in their arsenal," said David Wilcox, former head of the Fed's research division and now a senior fellow at the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 Wilcox said he feared the Fed's new framework, expected to be unveiled soon, will seem abstract unless it is coupled with new steps to enforce it, such as massive new bond-buying or the setting of explicit unemployment goals.
 The minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting indicated those steps may be coming further down the road, giving the central bank time to see how the economy behaves at this stage of the coronavirus pandemic. It has already chopped interest rates to zero, started some bond-buying, and approved massive lending programs.

American home ownership is soaring, which is good for all of us.
 Home sales slowed during the early months of covid-19, as millions of Americans stayed inside. In the past few months, however, with interest rates at historic lows, homes have been selling at a record pace, USA Today reports.
 As Americans flee dense urban areas, they’re looking for room to spread out – what we call “distancing” these days – and big yards for their kids to play in.
 I can’t wait for millions of erstwhile renters to become homeowners just like me.
 The Journal of the Center for Real Estate Studies reports homeowners enjoy long-term social and financial benefits. Their children do better in school. Homeowners are more likely to participate in community and civic activities and vote than are renters. They experience health benefits and, for most, a sense of well-being.
 “More recent studies have found that the wealth building effect of homeownership and the sense of control it provides to homeowners in a stable housing market affect homeowners’ mental and physical health in a positive way,” according to The Journal’s 2017 study.
 But, in my opinion, the greatest benefit of owning a home is that it forces you to embrace common sense.
 Common sense, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is “sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.” Regrettably, common sense isn’t so common anymore, but home ownership is a fantastic way for people to master it.
 No sooner do you make your first mortgage payment than you begin wondering if the popularity of socialist policies you were taught in school might make your future payments harder.
 Higher income taxes would leave you less money for future payments. The economy, if hobbled by restrictive policies – Google “Venezuela” – would produce fewer jobs, affording you less opportunity for a better job to continue paying your mortgage and improving your home.
 You’re certainly going to need a “rainy day fund” when you own a home. In fact, your home knows when you create one – and exactly how much you have in it.
 You see, every home has a sadistic sense of humor and will do something – say, explode its terra cotta sewage line on Thanksgiving morning – that causes you to create new curse words but, most of all, forces you to become ever more sensible.
 You’ll become suspicious of smooth-talking politicians who promise all kinds of freebies without explaining how they’ll pay for them. You’ll realize that you, a hard-working, homeowning taxpayer, will foot the bill. You’ll realize you’re being bamboozled.
 That will make you irritable and your irritability will make you pay closer attention and demand answers. If every voter had the sensibility you now have, imagine how much better our representatives – our whole government – would be.
 Imagine how much better the country would be if every American had “sound and prudent judgment based on a simple perception of the situation or facts.”
 Be cautious buying your first home, however. Low rates and high demand have prices rising fast. Be sure you’re making a sound decision, as MarketWatch covers.
 The best way to do that? Ask a homeowner for advice.

Instead, the party’s alternate reality reigned. Waving the bloody shirt of the clearing of Lafayette Square prior to a Trump photo-op in front of St. John’s Church, Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser declared that “it was here that, just weeks ago, Americans donned face masks and, safely and peacefully, protested the death of George Floyd. But while we were peacefully protesting, Donald Trump was plotting.”
 The truthfulness of this statement depends on her definition of “we” and of “peaceful,” since it’s a matter of record that protesters set a fire at the historic church and threw projectiles at riot forces. (Peaceful protesters do the damnedest things.)
 In the wake of all the not-so-peaceful protests, cities have experienced spikes in shootings. This, too, would seem to demand some acknowledgement, to keep the GOP from exploiting the lapse if nothing else, but speakers blithely skipped over it.
 Michelle Obama complained that “here at home as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and a never-ending list of innocent people of color continue to be murdered, stating the simple fact that a Black life matters is still met with derision from the nation’s highest office.”
 Why not mention the innocent people of color murdered every day, and not by law enforcement? Don’t they count, too?
 No, the Democratic Party prefers not to grapple with the uncomfortable truth that the riots have almost certainly materially harmed the lives of vulnerable people. It doesn’t want to admit the necessary work of cops patrolling dangerous urban neighborhoods and how if this work is stymied, poor people suffer.
 It considers itself the party of decency, as long as you don’t ask it to condemn mindless destruction and the shootings blighting our cities. It celebrates itself as the party of norms, except the ones necessary to law and order.

For historian Martha Jones, the ratification of the 19th amendment "marks for African American women a start, not a finish."
 "It fuels a new chapter in the struggle for voting rights in the United States," she says, "a movement that Black women will lead all the way to 1965 and passage of the Voting Rights Act."
 "One of the lessons that we learn when we compare 1920 and 2020," she continues, "is that voting rights is never a given. It's never a guarantee. It's not a done deal in the United States."
 In her office, Jones can look up at a visual reminder of that long history.
 Hanging on the wall is a portrait of her great-great-grandmother, Susan Davis, who was born enslaved in Kentucky.
 Jones likes to imagine her then-80-year-old ancestor on election day 1920, hitching up her horse and buggy, riding into town, "and getting into that line — a segregated line, but a line nonetheless — that would permit her and her daughter Lillian both to cast their first ballots."
 "I can't say for sure that Susan and Lillian voted on that day," Jones says. "I sure hope they did."
