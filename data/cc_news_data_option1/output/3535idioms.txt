China has been the main backer of Pakistan in FATF. As three votes are required at FATF to prevent blacklisting, Beijing, in cahoots with Malaysia and Turkey, has been blocking Pakistan’s blacklisting. One of the key agenda of Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s recent visit to Beijing was to seek China’s support ahead of the FATF review.

Eleanor McKay, aged 74, passed away peaceably on August 24, 2020 after a long and valiant fight with cancer. Her warmth, generosity and indomitable spirit lives on in the hearts of all who knew her, especially her beloved daughters, Eleanor Mary and Claire Catherine, who were at her side to the very end. Eleanor joins her husband of over 50 years, Joe Niermann, who died last year on August 9th. Born in Washington, DC, Eleanor spent her early years in Greece and Turkey. Eleanor had a deep love for both countries and everything about them. Greek and Turkish were, in fact, the first languages she spoke as a child. These early experiences were the foundation that shaped Eleanor's keen intellectual curiosity, her sense of inclusiveness and her generosity of spirit. It did not, however, hone her culinary skills. Despite Eleanor's infectious enthusiasm, her attempts at recreating the food of her childhood became the stuff of legend, much to the dismay of her husband, daughters, extended family and unsuspecting friends. She did get an A+ for effort. Somewhere in between getting two Master's Degrees, one in History from the University of Maryland, and a second in Library Sciences from the University of Wisconsin, Eleanor met her life-long partner and husband, Joe Niermann. It is said that this quirky young man convinced Eleanor into marriage after a roommate situation went south. Joe's proposal of marriage began with a curious query to Eleanor, "You don't have any special connection to marriage do you?" They were married for 51 years, until Joe's passing last summer. After braving one too many frigid Wisconsin winters, Joe and Eleanor moved their family of four to Memphis, Tennessee. Eleanor worked as an archivist for the Mississippi Valley Collection at Memphis State University, in addition to helping Joe restore a twenty room mansion. In the carriage house behind that mansion, Joe worked on restoration projects and began to create his own designs. Eleanor supported the family and when she wasn't working, assisted Joe with historical and technical research. It was in 1978, against the backdrop of a dilapidated Beaux Arts mansion, with two little girls and various cats running around, that Niermann Weeks was born. Joe and Eleanor worked together, side by side and with the help of their daughters (side note: it's not illegal to use your own kids as child labor) created a company that would become known worldwide for its sophisticated design and its bespoke craftsmanship. Eleanor and Joe moved their family and company to the DC area in 1984, making Annapolis their permanent home. As Niermann Weeks continued to grow and prosper, in good times and bad, Joe and Eleanor never lost sight of their original mission born out of that small carriage house in Memphis; to create and deliver superior high- quality design and craftsmanship. The family business continues to thrive with Joe and Eleanor's daughters, Eleanor and Claire Niermann and company President and 29 year Niermann Week's veteran, Justin Binnix at the helm. Eleanor, although long retired, leaves an indelible mark on her Niermann Weeks family as well the wider community, all whom she treasured and treated as family. Eleanor cultivated friendships like she did her gardens and she shared her seeds and love with family and friends across the country. She was the perfect cocktail of irreverence, devilish wit and unmatched enthusiasm. She made an impression wherever she went with her infectious warmth and her zest for life. We would all be better to be a bit like her. Throw caution to the wind today and do something really fun. Ruin a meal, eat some candy, spoil your children and even sink a boat (yes, Eleanor's antics included sinking two boats so the bar is high). In lieu of flowers, her daughters ask that people consider donations to the American Cancer Society or your local SPCA.

“It made a big difference to know so many of the guys there,” Moller said Saturday morning. “I know their game, and they know mine, so you’re so much more comfortable being around them. Even off the field, we were all hanging out, laughing and having fun, and that definitely gets you more relaxed to play the game. You know you don’t have to press around them because they all know what you can do. It made things a lot easier.”
 One of those relationships led to a fun moment in Moller’s final at-bat.
 Facing right-handed pitcher Irving Carter, a University of Miami recruit, Moller reluctantly took a ninth-inning walk. Moller gave Carter a playful look each time he missed the strike zone during the at-bat and joked with him as he jogged to first base.
 “When we were 15U, the first two times I faced him, I hit two bombs off him, and he hasn’t thrown me anything good since,” Moller said. “But he’s my boy. We talk or FaceTime pretty much every day and we’re always checking in on each other. And, even though we weren’t on the same team down here, we were pretty much always hanging out together. He’s really competitive, and he doesn’t want to give in to me. I don’t want to give into him either, so it’s all good.”
 Moller may have made things look fun and easy on Friday. But the game wasn’t without its challenges.
 Moller started and caught four different elite-level pitchers in his four innings behind the plate. With the game’s unique set-up, he remained in the batting order for the entire game.
 “Catching was a little difficult because, beside the starting pitcher, I didn’t get to catch any of them in the bullpen to get a feel for how they threw until we got out there,” said Moller, who accepted the Gold Glove Award as the top defensive player, regardless of position, in his class. “So, you had to adjust to it. All the guys I caught, I’ve caught before, but it was early in the summer. You just have to be patient and have confidence and everything will work out. They’re all good pitchers, they all have good stuff, so that makes it a lot easier.”
 Moller also called all of the pitches during his four innings. Somewhat surprisingly, none of the pitchers shook him off, a credit to his reputation as an elite catching prospect projected to be selected in the first round of next summer’s Major League Baseball Draft.
 “Before we go out, since I don’t always catch them, I try to go out and talk to them, ask them what pitches they like to throw in certain counts and stuff like that,” Moller said. “They’ll let me know what kind of pitcher they are and we’ll kind work from there. And I always tell them, if they don’t like a pitch I call or don’t feel comfortable with it, just shake me off and we’ll go to something else.
 “It’s a matter of communicating between me and the pitcher. All the pitchers have confidence in what I call, too, so everything worked out pretty well. If they have confidence in me, it gives them more confidence in themselves. It also lets me know that what I’m doing back there is right.”
 The same challenge applied to the offensive side of the plate. In his first at-bat, he just-missed on a pitch and skied a pop-up to shallow right field against No. 1 pitching prospect Andrew Painter in the first inning. Two innings later, he drilled a 350-foot double to left-centerfield against No. 2 pitching prospect Maddux Bruns, a left-hander committed to Mississippi State. He missed a home run by a couple of feet.
 “It felt good,” Moller said. “There was a lot of hype surrounding that pitcher, too, and he’s up to throwing 95 or 96 mph. But I felt comfortable seeing him, I saw the ball good and got a good swing off him. It felt great coming off the bat.
 “Most of the guys I hit against, I’ve never hit against before, so it was tough. You have to be relaxed up there and trust in your work and trust in what you’ve been doing your whole life. At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter how fast the ball’s coming, it’s just baseball and you have to go out and play the game. Let your talent do the work.”
 Perfect Game ranks the Louisiana State University recruit as the No. 2 overall prospect in his graduating class. Moller is the highest-ranked Iowan in the history of the PG rankings.
 The West roster included another player with Dubuque ties. Jackson Jobe, the son of professional golfer Brandt Jobe and Dubuque native Jennifer (Lukens) Jobe, pitched the sixth inning. He allowed a leadoff single but rebounded to retire the next three batters, including two via strikeout.
 The 6-2, 190-pound Jobe is the No. 15 overall prospect in the country and the No. 5-ranked righthanded pitcher. The Dallas native who now lives in Oklahoma City is also the No. 1 prospect in the state of Oklahoma.
 “I knew of him before, but this week was the first time I had a chance to sit down and talk to him,” Moller said. “He’s a pretty cool guy. He comes up to Dubuque a few times a year to visit in grandparents and go skiing and snowboarding. I gave him my number, so, the next time he comes up, maybe we can hang out.”

Giants: OF Austin Slater (strained left groin and flexor strain in right elbow) was reinstated from the 10-day IL and served as the designated hitter, going 0 for 5 in the leadoff spot. He is not yet available to play in the outfield due to the elbow soreness. "We'll keep looking at that day-to-day," Kapler said. "It's improving and getting better every single day, but we're going to wait for that final green light where we know he's going to be safe." ... RHP Jeff Samardzija (inflammation in right shoulder) and LHP Drew Smyly (sprained left index finger) each threw approximately 50 pitches in three- inning simulated games. Both threw all of their pitches and came out feeling healthy. The Giants will determine their next step in the coming days.

After months on the sidelines, the Lawton Philharmonic Orchestra is coming back just in time for fall with a televised performance of Vivaldi’s classic “Four Seasons.”
 Led, as always, by Maestro Jon Kalbfleisch, the orchestra was joined by virtuoso violinist David Kim for a recording of a performance of the concert that will premiere from 7-9 p.m. Sept. 12 on KSWO.
 “Fortunately, the Lawton Philharmonic board understands the importance of continuing to provide music to the community, by whatever means we can,” Kalbfleisch said.
 For many of the players, the session was the first of its kind since March, when COVID-19’s spread forced the premature climax of many musical seasons across the world.
 “It was a welcome opportunity for all of us,” Kalbfleisch said. “David and I also recorded a student outreach video, which will be available online to students in Southwest Oklahoma, as a vital part of our mission. Music education is essential, especially now.”
 The broadcast, dubbed “Celebration of the Arts,” is being presented by the McMahon Foundation and will feature representatives from the foundation and Arts for All alongside the orchestra.
 “The fact that the program also includes insightful information on the McMahon Foundation, and Lawton’s other fine arts organizations, is an incredible bonus,” Kalbfleisch said.
 “The Four Seasons,” is one of the most recognizable and popular pieces of classical music ever written, according to Kalbfleisch. It consists of four distinct violin concertos, one for each season.
 “Vivaldi was one of the first composers to write music that specifically imitates nature; we can hear the fierce winds, the tuneful bird calls, the barking dog, the crackling ice and the lazy slumber after a hunt, just to name a few in this remarkable composition,” Kalbfleisch said.
 For David Kim, the concert’s guest soloist, traveling to Lawton to perform on stage with other players represented an opportunity to return to an area that feels natural to him.
 “I feel so comfortable in Lawton,” Kim, who has played with the LPO on several occasions, said.
 Kim lives in Philadelphia, where he serves as Concert Master and 1st Chair Violin for the Philadelphia Orchestra, but he also travels the country performing as a guest with orchestras in several states. At least, he did, right up until March 2020.
 “I was so worried because so many of my concerts have been postponed this year,” Kim said. “The first one of my season was scheduled for Lawton and I was just waiting to get that dreaded email.”
 But the email he got instead was one looking to create a different kind of experience. One that would help the orchestra maintain relevance, while also keeping the musicians safe and allowing them to reach a brand-new audience.
 “We spent two days recording at the McMahon and creating some great material for kids … and of course the wonderful concert feature Vivaldi,” Kim said.
 While recording a performance is nothing new for Kim, recording one while playing in a face mask, socially distanced from all the other musicians on the stage, proved to be a unique experience.
 “Playing with masks on is so different than anything I have experienced before,” Kim said. “You don’t realize the amount of respiration that happens when you are playing, it is that much more exhausting. But all that being said, everybody rose to the occasion and it was very well done.”
 The broadcast is set to premiere on Sept. 12, and immediately following the broadcast the concert will be available to view on the orchestra's website, lawtonphil.com.

Last week, a mob of white protesters swarmed a white woman eating dinner in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Video of the bullies demanding that patrons raise their fists in solidarity with the movement went viral.
 Many pro-Trump and right-wing media personalities were quick to insist this verbal assault was emblematic of the entire Democratic Party and the broader “American left.” Never mind that the victim, Lauren B. Victor, was a fellow progressive who told a reporter from The Washington Post, “I’m very much with them. I’ve been marching with them for weeks and weeks and weeks.”
 Among the funny things about this decidedly unfunny event is that it would have been almost impossible for this roving rhetorical goon squad to find the kind of victims they surely wanted. Adams Morgan is an especially liberal neighborhood in a very liberal city. Sure, there are some conservatives there — I lived in Adams Morgan for over a decade — but picking on random white people in Adams Morgan in the hope of finding MAGA types is like scouring Manhattan’s Upper West Side for taxidermists. It’s theoretically possible to find one, but you’ll have your work cut out for you.

ATLANTA — The final hole at East Lake brought two strange sights Saturday at the Tour Championship.
 First, Rory McIlroy hit a shot that toppled out of thick rough right into the water in front of him, a distance laser cameras estimated at 85 feet, 8 inches, not accounting for how far it sank to the bottom.
 Then, Dustin Johnson reached his drive and could see the entire golf ball in the grass. It was in the first cut, sure, but a relief considering he didn’t hit a fairway over the final three hours.
 It was a rare green light for Johnson, and he hit 5-iron to 30 feet for a two- putt birdie and an even-par 70, allowing to escape with a one-shot lead over Sungjae Im at the halfway point of the chase for the FedEx Cup and the $15 million prize.
 Johnson headed straight to the range to try to figure out why he hit only two fairways, though he was satisfied to have so few chances and still stay in front.
 “Two different golf courses if you’re playing from the fairway or playing from the rough,” Johnson said. “Playing from the fairway you can attack the course, you can shoot a good score. Playing from where I did, it’s not so much fun. But I managed my game pretty well, and pleased with the score that I shot, especially the way I drove the ball.”
 McIlroy also shrugged off his shot, in which he tried to do too much with a gnarly lie, not so much to get over the water but a bunker on the right side. It cost him a bogey for a 71 that left him five behind, though he could see a bigger picture.
 “It doesn’t look like I’m going to lose any ground today anyway, which is some sort of consolation,” he said.
 That might have been the best take after a second round filled with birdies and blunders. The next 36 holes are all about opportunity for the nine player separated by just five shots.
 As well as Johnson has been playing — two runner-up finishes and an 11-shot victory in his last three starts — there was a chance he could have taken his two-shot lead at the start of the tournament and run away with it.
 Johnson, with rounds of 67-70 along with starting at 10 under as the No. 1 seed in the FedEx Cup, was at 13 under.
 Im, the budding star from South Korea whose game had gone lukewarm coming out of the three-month shutdown, birdied three of his last four holes for a 64 and will be in the final group with Johnson.
 Xander Schauffele, who won the Tour Championship as a rookie in 2017, ran off three straight birdies late in his round for a 65 and was two shots behind. Another big move came from PGA champion Collin Morikawa, whose 66 put him four shots out of the lead.
 Johnson hit the fairway on the first and fifth holes — both pars. He still managed a birdie on No. 8 when he drove into a bunker, came up short of the green and chipped in from 40 feet, both the par 5s and on No. 3, where he made a 40-footer.
 “I feel like I got my two bad rounds out of the way and I got two good ones coming, where the other guys, they’ve shot some good scores,” Johnson said. “My game feels good. I’ve still got a lot of confidence in everything I’m doing. Just I’ve got to hit it in the fairway. That’s pretty simple.”
 He wasn’t alone in his struggles.
 Justin Thomas pulled within one shot until he couldn’t convert birdie chances and then drove so far left on the 18th that he had to pitch out sideways, leading to bogey and a 71.
 Jon Rahm again was keeping stride with Johnson until he found the water off the tee at the par-3 15th and made double bogey, followed by a wild drive that led to bogey on the 16th. He shot a 74, nine shots worse than his opening round. That left him four shots behind at 9 under.
 That’s what was so maddening for Thomas, who felt like he was hitting it well enough from tee to green. He ranks last in the 30-man field in putting, which would not surprise him.
 “I should have never shot over par today with how well I played,” he said. “I just made absolutely nothing.”
 That much was evident when his 6-foot par putt swirled in and out of the cup, and Thomas gave it a sarcastic thumbs-up.
 Rahm was frustrated as ever, mainly because he couldn’t capitalize when he was in the fairway and felt it was another round at East Lake that would cost him. Now, however, he’s still only four shots behind with 36 holes remaining and $15 million still very much up for grabs.
 “The closest I came from the fifth hole on to make a birdie was that bunker shot on 18,” he said of his third shot from behind the green. “That’s the best look I had all day. It’s just one of those days. But like you said, the mentality is right now we’ve played two days of the tournament. I’m four back going into the weekend. Anything can happen.”

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Bob Baffert endured the lowest of lows and highest of highs within minutes in the Kentucky Derby.
 He was bummed before the horses left the paddock after Thousand Words reared up and fell on its side, getting disqualified and injuring Baffert’s assistant trainer. That emotion was quickly replaced by Authentic’s front-running victory that gave Baffert a record-tying sixth Derby win.
 Then Baffert found himself down again, literally, getting knocked to the grass by a skittish Authentic in the winner’s circle.
 “This is the craziest year ever,” he said.
 Authentic kicked away from heavy favorite Tiz the Law in the stretch on Saturday, winning the 146th Derby by 1 1/4 lengths without the usual crowd of 150,000 on hand at Churchill Downs for the first time because of the coronavirus pandemic. The bay colt ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:00.61 under John Velazquez, who won his third Derby.
 “I’ve had some great Derby rides, but what that guy did,” Baffert said, gesturing toward Velazquez, who stood socially distanced in the infield winner’s circle. “Johnny V. gave him an incredible ride.”
 Baffert tied Ben Jones (1938-52) for the most wins by a trainer. His other victories came in 1997, 1998, 2002, 2015 with eventual Triple Crown winner Justify and 2018.
 Sent off at 3-5 as the biggest Derby favorite in 31 years and part of a smaller field than usual, Tiz the Law stalked Authentic on the outside before challenging at the top of the stretch. But Authentic found another gear and pulled away from the Belmont winner, who came in 4 for 4 this year.
 “Yes! Yes!” Baffert shouted in the paddock, where he watched on the video screen.
 Thousand Words acted up in the paddock, reared up and fell on his side shortly before post time. Baffert said his assistant, Jim Barnes, broke his arm trying to get the saddle on the unruly colt. Thousand Words wasn’t injured, according to the on-call veterinarian.
 In the winner’s circle, the long ribbons hanging off the garland of red roses kept hitting Authentic’s hind leg, agitating him, and in turn he knocked the white-haired trainer to the ground.
 “He spun around and he was like a bowling ball. He just spun us all around,” Baffert said. “The turf course is pretty soft here, so it wasn’t too bad. I was probably more embarrassed than anything when I hit the ground.”
 It’s been that kind of year for Baffert. The Hall of Fame trainer was loaded with promising 3-year-olds early on. Then Nadal got hurt and had to be retired and Charlatan went on the shelf with a minor injury. Authentic had issues, so Baffert gave him an extended break.
 In between, Charlatan and another of Baffert’s horses had positive drug tests in Arkansas. Baffert is appealing his resulting 15-day suspension. The trainer mourned the death of Arrogate, North America’s all-time earnings leader, this summer.
 “It’s been a roller-coaster year, but thankfully it’s the love of the horses that keeps me going,” said Baffert, his voice breaking. “They’re the best therapy a human can have. I love being around them.”
 Authentic is co-owned by Spendthrift Farm, the racing operation of B. Wayne Hughes, the 86-year-old founder of Public Storage who also co-owns Thousand Words. Hughes won his first Derby. Also part of Authentic’s ownership is MyRaceHorse Stable, whose 4,600 participants include Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler and former Olympic skier Bode Miller. They paid about $206 each for a share.
 Authentic paid $18.80, $6 and $5 at 8-1 odds. Tiz the Law returned $3.40 and $3.20.
 Mr. Big News was another two lengths back in third and paid $16.80 to show at 46-1.
 Tiz the Law had already won the Belmont, the kickoff to the reconfigured Triple Crown that was run in June at a shorter distance. He followed that up with an easy win in the Travers, setting himself up as the dominant horse heading into the Derby.
 But Velazquez hustled Authentic out of the far outside post and to the lead. Following Baffert’s instructions, Velazquez used a left-handed whip in the stretch to keep the skittish colt’s mind on business. Authentic wears ear plugs.
 “He’s a little flighty,” Baffert said. “He’s a gentle horse, but he’s a little high-strung.”
 Jockeys chirping at their horses and whips striking flesh in the stretch drive — sounds typically drowned out by raucous fans — echoed across the swath of empty seats under the Twin Spires. Bugler Steve Buttleman played “My Old Kentucky Home” in place of the absent University of Louisville marching band. The song was preceded by a moment of silence to recognize the inequities facing society. Protesters converged outside Churchill Downs demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman shot dead in her home in March when police burst in to serve a search warrant in the middle of the night.
 The demonstrators were peaceful as they circled the historic track. They chanted “No justice, no Derby!” and carried signs imploring people to say Taylor’s name. Police watched in riot gear with clubs, some on horses and some with armored military vehicles.
 “I’d love to be up here pounding my chest because I just won six,” Baffert said, “but I feel for everybody in the city.”
 Velazquez was one of several jockeys in the race who wore black bands with the phrase “Equality for all.”
 The field of 15 horses was the smallest since 1998.
 Max Player was fourth, followed by Storm the Court, Enforceable, Ny Traffic and Necker Island, Major Fed, Sole Volante, Winning Impression, Money Moves, Attachment Rate and South Bend.

 “Tulsa is a very important cable market,” said Rodney Allen, southwest marketing manager for Warner Amex Satellite Entertainment Co. “And we are putting sizable monies and time behind its introduction into Tulsa.”
 Early in the documentary, it is alleged that, before MTV, there was nothing youths really cared about on TV. MTV was a different animal.

It’s a curious specification, this car. The seats are electrically adjusted every which way, but nobody’s checked the option to heat them. Usually I’d happily do without warming. Indeed, the Speedster’s a car best experienced with the standard Sports buckets where warmed buttocks aren’t even possible. There’s no Sport Chrono, either, while the headlights are the standard items, rather than Porsche’s Dynamic Light System. Like seat heating, they’ll be missed tonight, as their ability to turn night into day would no doubt have been useful.

The problem is intensified by the tendency of the hyper-politically engaged left and right to listen only to people in their own echo chamber and to mistake Twitter outrage for sentiment on the ground. So despite the fact that a majority of Black and Latino people want the same amount or more police in their communities, we spent weeks listening to “experts” claim that “abolish the police” is a reasonable, mainstream position. (Here’s an illustrative heuristic: If you hear politicians or journalists using the label “Latinx” to describe Latinos, you’re listening to someone in a bubble. According to recent Pew Research Center polling, only about 25% of Latinos know the term and only about 3% actually use it.

Apparently Kielder Water is to my right, not that I can see it, the sat-nav screen informing me it’s there. The road highlighted alongside it is single track, with passing areas. It’s damp and cold, yet the Speedster’s Dunlop Sport Maxx Race 2 tyres are finding bite, giving incredible traction in difficult conditions. Here, the visceral element of the Speedster is raised to new levels. I’m feeling my way down the road, my eyes transfixed and focused within the limited reach of the headlights’ beams, the available grip communicated through the steering wheel and the seat. There’s more purchase than I’d anticipated in such conditions. It’s just three degrees, and the traffic on these roads is usually forestry and agricultural, with the inevitable detritus flung from their off-road tyres creating a slippery sheen between rubber and tarmac.

MEDICINE PARK — You can’t be blue at the 14th Annual Medicine Park Blues Ball.
 It’s too good of a time. That’s why you let the music do the talking so you can use your mouth for smiling. Just like it was planned, according to Rodney Whaley, event coordinator.
 “This is the biggest event of the year,” he said. “Our audience for this is really laid back, loyal, respectful and they clean up after themselves.”
 Whaley said that Friday night’s kick-off performances by Sweet Brenda and Big Mike Griffin was the perfect way to open things up. He said Sweet Brenda “came out so freaking strong” and was the perfect opener for Lawton’s own Griffin.
 “Dude, last night was so good,” he said on Saturday. “There was plenty of room for everybody to have their comfortable space.”
 That’s an important commodity while remaining wary of COVID-19. The virus had put a damper on the cobblestone community’s earlier festivals this year. Returning to normalcy with an eye on safety has been a key to planning, according to Whaley.
 With blue skies overhead and warm but not too hot temperatures on Saturday the main road through town was laden with festival goers.
 Seated on a curb in the shade, the Coar family – Olga, Thomas, Andrew and Evelyn — were happy to have made the trip up from Texas to watch T.J. Coar sing with his bandmates in The Midniters.
 It was the family’s second time visiting Medicine Park for a festival; T.J.’s band performed at the Rock in the Park Festival in July. Olga Coar said it was an easy decision to return to Medicine Park.
 “I love it,” she said.
 That’s a feeling shared by the enthusiastic audience.
 Seated in the big chair outside Comanche Shirt Co., Lawton’s Mark and Stephanie Newby and their dogs, Sadie and Little One, were all smiles as they anticipated Saturday’s lineup.
 “This is our third year (to attend),” Mark Newby said. “I love the mixture of music and atmosphere.”
 Stephanie Newby had a favorite scheduled to headline the evening lineup she mentioned while following up her husband’s reference to the music.
 “Especially Red (Lawton native Eric “Dirty Red” McDaniel and his bandmates in the Soul Shakers),” she said.
 Whaley said there’s something calming about the setting and the blues scene.
 “Everybody’s out here to relax,” he said. “It’s like your heart finds the rhythm when you’re by the ocean, it’s the same with music.”
 Credit goes to the Medicine Park Public Works Authority, Lawton Economic Development Authority and a host of volunteers in making this annual event something special, Whaley said. Especially this year, his first in the role as event coordinator.
 “I’m fortunate to have a long list of people I can call,” he said.
 Something new that seems to have caught on is Whaley leading the audience in the “Pledge of Allegiance” before the evening headline act. He said the first night, it offered a sense of unity that struck a chord in his heart.
 “In Medicine Park, you have the freedom to enjoy yourself,” he said. “Look what we all have in common right now.”

The reason why there is low money velocity is that the treasury prints the money and deposits into the too big to fail banks who simply sit on the money and either buy risk-free, low yield assets like Treasury bills ; or fund high- risk high reward IB activities.

We are officially three weeks into the school year. It has been warming to the soul to hear the sounds that fill our buildings once again. Children are laughing with their peers, students are engaging with their teachers, the yummy smell from the cafeteria stops us in our tracks, and yes, masks have become part of the normal school attire.
 We know this year looks a lot different from years past. Coming back to school, whether traditionally or virtually, has been something students have looked forward to more than ever before. I know there was uncertainty for what the fall semester would look like this year, but I am very proud of the dedication and countless hours put in by our staff and teachers. We are building the structure for the future, not just a single school year.
 Our district has taken action to move forward for the betterment of our students and community. Recently at the Oklahoma State Department of Education Board meeting, Lawton Public Schools was recognized for its exemplary work with the virtual night option for students and families. This recognition is due to the leadership and educators who stepped up to the challenge to provide a service that no other district in the state is doing.
 We have over 5,000 students across the district who have taken the option to go virtually and 8,000 plus students that have filled our hallways and classrooms. That doesn’t mean that we have not hit a few bumps along this journey, but I have to take this time to thank and show appreciation to our dedicated staff from the bus drivers, cooks, and custodians to the secretaries, teachers, administrators and families of Lawton Public Schools. You have made the start of the school year successful for our students.
 As much as our educators have wanted to be back in the classroom, our students have longed for the same thing. I want to thank our students for all that they have done to ensure that our staff and their peers remain as safe as possible by following the protocols laid out to stop the spread of COVID-19. We know this is not easy for you either, but because of your efforts we are able to do our part to make your educational time and experience with Lawton Public Schools the best it can be.
 In this ever-changing environment, I want our staff, students and families to know that I am dedicated to making Lawton Public Schools the best district we can be. We will continue to build this plane while we fly it and celebrate our students and staff. I am thankful for your commitment and support to our district.
 I also want to take this opportunity to remind everyone that has not already done so to please fill out the 2020 Census survey. It will only take five minutes of your day to make an impact that will affect us for the next 10 years. Let’s not go undercounted or underfunded. The data will ensure that our community and our students will have the resources they need.
 Continue to share your questions with our staff, and I’d love to hear any celebrations or special shout-outs for our staff. Remember, our goal is to keep the school day as normal as we possibly can with flexibility and safety as the priority. I continue to be amazed with the community support and thankful for the trust placed in me and our district to care for their students. I promise every day we will get better and be better than we were the day before. This year, we cannot get through it alone. We must make a conscientious effort to support each other and keep our lines of communication open. We can do this Lawton! We are LPS!
