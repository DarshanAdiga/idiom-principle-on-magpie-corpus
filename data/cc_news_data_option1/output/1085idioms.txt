The worlds richest nations prepared more costly measures on Tuesday to combat the global fallout of the coronavirus that has infected tens of thousands of people, triggered social restrictions unseen since World War Two and sent economies spinning toward recession.With the highly contagious respiratory disease that originated in China racing across the world to infect more than 190,000 people, governments on every continent have implemented draconian containment measures from halting travel to stopping sports and religious gatherings. While the main aim is to avoid deaths - currently at over 7,500 - global powers were also focussing their attention on how to limit the inevitably devastating economic impact.In the worlds biggest economy, the United States Senate prepared to consider a multibillion-dollar emergency spending bill to offer relief from the pandemic, but the Trump administration pressed for 850 billion more. Airlines are among the worst-hit sector, with U.S. carriers seeking at least 50 billion in grants and loans to stay afloat as passenger numbers evaporate.Britain, which has told people to avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and theaters, unveiled a 330 billion pounds 400 billion rescue package for businesses threatened with collapse. Budget forecasters said the scale of borrowing needed might resemble the vast amount of debt taken on during the 1939-1945 war against Nazi Germany.Now is not a time to be squeamish about public sector debt, Robert Chote, head of the Office for Budget Responsibility, told lawmakers.

France is to pump 45 billion euros 50 billion of crisis measures into the economy to help companies and workers, with output expected to contract 1 this year.I have always defended financial rigor in peacetime so that France does not have to skimp on its budget in times of war, Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin was quoted as saying by financial daily Les Echos. The European Union EU eased its rules to allow companies to receive state grants up to 500,000 euros 551,000 or guarantees on bank loans to ensure liquidity.Such promised cash splurges did not, however, enable world share markets or oil prices to shake off their coronavirus nightmare after Wall Street on Monday saw its worst rout since the Black Monday crash of 1987. The Philippines was the first country to close markets, while Europe - now the epicenter of the pandemic - saw airline and travel stocks plunge another 7.With various central banks around the world having cut interest rates to try and help beleaguered economies, investors fret that they may have used up their policy ammunition early with far longer to go before the global health crisis is curbed.

The extensive Galaxy Tab portfolio includes everything from ultra-affordable 7-inchers to high-end 10.5-inch models and even a gargantuan 17.3-inch variant with a built-in kickstand. While the Galaxy Tab S6 and Galaxy View 2 are unfortunately not discounted today by Woot, pretty much all other Samsung slates released in the last few years can be purchased for 24 hours only at essentially unrivaled prices in "factory reconditioned" condition.
   
 ## Check out the deals here
   
   
 We're talking a grand total of 14 models, available for anywhere between $74.99 and $439.99 with a 90-day warranty provided by none other than Samsung included and Woot's solemn promise of full functionality. In fact, the Amazon- owned e-tailer calls these budget-friendly bad boys "as close to new as you can get without technically being new." Otherwise put, you should hardly be able to notice any difference between the heavily marked-down tablets on sale today and their brand-new counterparts typically fetching significantly higher prices.
   
 Released just last year, the Galaxy Tab S5e is undoubtedly one of the most compelling bargains on offer here, setting you back $299.99 with 64 gigs of internal storage space and 4 gigs of memory and $349.99 in a 128GB/6GB configuration. Both of those variants merely support Wi-Fi connectivity, unlike an older Galaxy Tab S4 up for grabs at $439.99 with 4G LTE technology for Verizon also included.
   
 If you're interested in spending as little as possible, the $99.99 Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2019) is probably the one to get, given its young age, overall respectable specifications, and guaranteed Android 10 update likely to come sometime this summer.
   
 Even though they're older and unlikely to receive any further software support, the $154.99 Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2018) with cellular connectivity for AT&T and Verizon and the $209.99 Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with S Pen might be worth a look as well if you need those particular amenities in addition to all the standard features of these respectable mid-rangers.

The world is an entirely different place right now, and both the supply and demand for new smartphones have been hit hard by the closing of factories, difficulties in meeting previously set deadlines for the production of various key components, and, well, people going out less and spending more of their money on non-perishable food items and essential supplies.
   
 Unsurprisingly, Samsung is said to have "radically cut its demand for S20 parts" after closely monitoring the initial sales of the ultra-high-end handset family, although the "industry sources" quoted by Korean media are keeping things awfully vague for the time being.
   
 We don't know exactly how many copies the company has sold so far or how many more it expects to sell by the end of 2020, but the yearly total is clearly unlikely to rival the 36 million, 32 million, 38 million, and 40 million tallies of the S10, S9, S8, and S7 lineups respectively in past years.
 ## Believe it or not, the S20 Ultra is the most popular model
   
 Even though we can totally understand why one would be attracted to an absolute 6.9-inch beast with a quad rear-facing camera setup fronted by a 108MP primary shooter and a 5,000mAh battery under the hood, we never expected the $1,400 and up phone to outsell its cheaper and only slightly humbler siblings.

Following the measures, hundreds of University of Rwanda students in Huye District were stranded in their campus after failing to find buses back home as public transport firms gave priority to high school learners, reported the country’s New Times Rwanda.
 Rwanda’s public transport has been disrupted across the country since Sunday when the Ministry of Education embarked on a major effort to get all high school students back home in a space of two days following the outbreak of the deadly new coronavirus in Rwanda, it was reported further.
 In Kenya, Health Cabinet Secretary Mutahi Kagwe said in a media briefing that all travellers into Kenya including citizens, diplomats, residents and UN staff would swear a legal document that they will observe quarantine rules.
 President Uhuru Kenyatta has since suspended learning at all levels and announced a nationwide partial lockdown. He encouraged businesses and government offices to close all non-essential services.
 Mr Kenyatta has declared Saturday a National Day of Prayer amid the worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
 Mr Kenyatta made the declaration yesterday after the cases of COVID-19 rose to four.
 “We cannot ignore the need to turn to God. In these circumstances as we have done in the past as a nation, we have always turned to God first to give thanks for the many blessings that he has bestowed on our nation,’’ he said.
 In Tanzania, since Monday when Health minister Ummy Mwalimu announced the country’s first case of coronavirus, relevant authorities across the country were informed on measures to take to prevent the virus from spreading.
 “The case is an imported case and that the authorities are doing all that is possible to contain the situation,” she said.
 Ms Mwalimu said a 46-year-old Tanzanian woman was the first to test positive of the deadly virus on Sunday, March 15. The minister said the woman arrived in Tanzania aboard RwandAir from Belgium.
 “Between March 3 and 13, she also visited Sweden and Denmark. She then went back to Belgium before returning to Tanzania on March 15 via Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA),” Ms Mwalimu said. Regional authorities in Arusha said the movement of the patient reveal a complex circle as they pledged to work around the clock to get all those who were in contact with the driver who picked her from the airport.
 In Uganda, where no case has been reported, President Yoweri Museveni’s interface with the media for his national address that was scheduled for Wednesday has been called off as a safety measure in combating the looming coronavirus pandemic.
 The President was supposed to address the nation on government’s stand on the coronavirus.
 This, according, to a senior press sectary to the President, Ms Lindah Nabusayi, is to prevent a possible spread of the coronavirus. Ms Nabusayi says the development is “as advised by the relevant health officials against meetings.
