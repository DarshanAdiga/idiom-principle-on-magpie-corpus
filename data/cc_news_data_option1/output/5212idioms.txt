The tires rotated so slow, so heavily, displacing ground as her Mercury Capri scorched in front of the still pink, and blue morning sky. There was humming, down the road and to his left. Something was there, far from him to distinguish but close enough to see it was human. Maybe. Humming. Androgenous humming. The car caught aflame. He looked to his left and it wasn’t there. The humming grew so loud, but to his right. He turned and it was there. Beside him, suspended in air. Falling. Soft white, revival cloth on its body. The back of a bald, brown head was what he saw of the apparition. It floated, in that falling posture. The humming intensified as it turned to him, just as the car exploded and he awoke to his Uncle standing in the doorway, in a half statement.

The three House seats are in Democratic strongholds and expected to be off- limits to Republicans. But special elections can throw curveballs, and the staggered timing would also give the campaigns ample running room to shore up the candidates and races.
 Democrats are already deep into political soul-searching after a dismal November outcome for House Democrats. Biden's victory had short coattails as they lost seats and saw their majority shrink.
 Moderate lawmakers and strategists blamed progressives for pushing the party's message too far leftward; progressives complained it was centrists who ran timid campaigns without a bold message to attract voters.
 Pelosi is a master vote counter on the House floor, but even her skills will be tested in the new Congress, starting with her own election for another term as speaker. If even a few Democratic lawmakers object or peel off, passing bills in the new Congress could be difficult.
 In an extreme scenario, Republicans could even try to wrest control of the gavel and the majority. If the numbers dipped so low -- with illnesses or other absences, which are likely during the COVID-19 crisis -- Republicans could try to force a floor vote on the issue.
 Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Friday that the departures of the three lawmakers would combine with existing divisions among Democrats to make governing "very hard" for Pelosi.
 "On any given vote when your margin is as narrow as this, a few people can be mad about something totally unrelated to the vote and just take it out on you," Cole said.
 The danger zone was close enough that House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer warned Biden last month off taking any more Democrats from his ranks.
 "I thought it would be difficult if, in fact, members of the Congress were selected," Hoyer told reporters this week. "The margin was very close."
 A similar scenario has played out in the Senate, where Biden has refrained from naming senators to administrative positions because of the narrow GOP hold.
 The Senate breakdown will be 50-48 when the new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3, with the majority not yet decided until two Jan. 5 run-off elections in Georgia.
 In some ways, the closely split House could provide an opportunity for Biden to reach across the aisle and try to cut bipartisan deals with a centrist agenda that could attract some Republicans.
 But so far, House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has signaled movement in the opposite direction. He wants to use floor procedures as political weaponry to gum up the bills with Republican priorities and force vulnerable Democrats into tough votes.
 Republicans used the strategy with some success in the current session of Congress, producing campaign ads against Democrats seeking reelection. McCarthy, his own shot at seizing the majority for Republicans in 2022 now within reached, warned shortly after the November election there would be more floor battles to come.
 McCarthy said while Republicans won't have the majority in the new year, they will "run the floor."
 To block those efforts, Democrats are considering rules changes proposed by Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., that would raise the threshold on those votes to a two-thirds majority to make it more difficult for Republicans to change the bills.
 Yet the first legislation of the new Congress may not be too difficult for Pelosi to pass, even with a slimmer majority.
 The agenda is likely to be rooted in H.R. 1 through H.R.9 - the first nine bills of the last Congress -- popular Democratic measures on voting rights, lowering prescription drug prices, raising the minimum wage and requiring background checks for gun purchases that most Democrats have already voted for.
