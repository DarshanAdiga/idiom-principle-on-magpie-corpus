01-14-2020, at approximately 610 PM, the Humboldt Area CHP responded to a two vehicle collision on US-101 at Indianola Cutoff. Upon CHP arrival, it was determined that a 1991 GMC Jimmy, being driven by 48 year old William Clymer of Eureka, was attempting to turn from southbound US-101 to Indianola Cutoff. A 2019 GMC Yukon, being driven by 42 year old Michael Snorden of Indianapolis, collided with the passenger side of the GMC Jimmy as it crossed the northbound lanes. The impact caused the GMC Jimmy to overturn. Emergency medical personnel arrived on scene and provided aid to Mr. Clymer. However, Mr. Clymer succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased by medical personnel. The Humboldt County Coroner's office has subsequently made notifications to Mr. Clymer's immediate family.

Your house may be a real gem, but do its bones include actual precious metals? In Prospect Lefferts Gardens, this 25-foot-wide townhouse has a wood-paneled parlor with a vaulted 22-karat gold-leaf ceiling. As The Post reported in 2018 — the home has bounced on and off the market since then — the property’s crown moldings and decorative fireplaces are original to its construction at the turn of the last century, but this glowing addition was installed later. Elsewhere, the five-bedroom pad has stained glass windows, a deck and a private garage.

Like most days we were at the doctor today. Today we were 2 hours past the appointment time before being seen. It's ridiculous. They should rename the "waiting room". It's really a "wasting room".
 Many of you know I'm a retired Air Force NCO. Anyone that has been in that service knows that there are a couple of sacred institutions. The most sacred is the golf course. Generals fly all over the world, not to make our country secure, but to play golf. Who knows, the golf course may actually be where third-world resources are divvied up. I do know that if you're on the fairway, and you do a few donuts in your Jeep, your career is dead.
 The second-most sacred institution is the Dental Clinic. Somehow the Tabernacle of Teeth has grown to be a promotion-maker and a career-taker on Air Force bases everywhere. You can save the planet from nuclear holocaust by throwing yourself in front of a hijacked airplane, but if you miss a dental appointment and get a "no-show" letter, you're going to be picking up cigarette butts until the apocalypse. If you make your dental checkups you could throw the commander's fluffy poodle in front of a troop bus and you'd still get promoted.
 Being a good NCO, I went to the dentist on time, but he was always extremely late. I calculated that my time was as valuable as his, so I sent a "no-show" to his commander. Bad idea. I ended up standing tall in my commanders office, as well as at the base commanders office. They weren't amused by my keen insight. I escaped getting busted "by the skin of my teeth.
 I carry that sentiment with me to this day. I understand that doctors and dentists do things I can't do. I just wish that they'd do it in a timely manner. It's like this. If I'm in my recliner and turn the TV to watch the "Monk" marathon and I'm 2 hours late they'll start without me. TV doesn't wait, so why should I wait on a medical practitioner?
 At today's doctor visit, we waited hours to get called into an exam room so we could wait some more. I read the 400 homemade signs on the wall. The receptionist window had a sign that said, "don't knock on the window". At least 3 of the signs said "If you are late for your appointment we charge a fee of $30. If you miss your appointment we charge a fee of $30."
 The way I see it, if they can charge me $30 for being 5 minutes late, I can do the same for them. I'll even give them a break. I'll give them 10 minutes before I bill them.
 I may start carrying a receipt book with me. If they're able to pay immediately, I'll even give them a small discount and thank them for the prompt payment.
 At this point you probably think I'm an idiot and you may be right, but riddle me this. A doctor has 8 years of higher education. If it takes an average of 20 minutes per patient but he schedules 15 minutes, that won't ever work. If our system never works, then we need a new system.
 In the meantime, I'll be preparing to bill the cornucopia of doctors we geezers visit. If they pay promptly, I'll be able to get the DVR I need to make sure I don't miss the Monk reruns. If they don't pay promptly I guess I'll do donuts on their golf courses. Maybe that'll speed them up.
 Fini.

Remember those horrible old days of personal computing when "reboot" was the most commonly used word around the office? I fondly recall banging out news stories on my state-of-the-art Apple IIe when the waffle-sized screen would flicker and go black. "Gotta reboot," I'd say with confidence. I would then proceed to repeatedly hit the "On" button, then yank the plug from the wall, followed by the crucial follow-up step of plugging it back in. If nothing else worked, I'd whack the console from several different angles. Open palm only, of course.
 The general unpleasantness associated with "reboot" crept back into my world and kicked me in the groin last week when I read on Barstool Sports that Universal is developing a remake of "Jaws," and I share writer Jerry Thornton's outrage. I've written many times in this space of my adoration for Steve Spielberg's 1975 blockbuster, the greatest summer film of all time. Only last September I wrote, "When Ben Gardner's severed head popped out from beneath his crippled boat and scared the crap out of Richard Dreyfuss (and the audience), I was lost forever to this movie."
 I still am. Which is why the prospect of a reboot fills me with … what? Dread, maybe. Anger, possibly. Certainty, certainly -- that it is unnecessary and destined to be terrible.
 I have history on my side. Consider some of the reboots Hollywood thought were good ideas:
 "Dirty Dancing" (2017). Remove Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey and replace them with Colt Pratts and Abigail Breslin, who have less chemistry than a Bunsen burner. And ditch most of the dirty dancing. What could possibly go right?
 "Godzilla" (1998). Why the fascination with remaking a Japanese B movie about a giant lumbering lizard? This Matthew Broderick version is truly the worst of the re-dos, down to the fact the monster is as tall as a building in some scenes, yet can hide in the subway in others.
 "Miracle on 34th Street" (1994). Did the filmmakers never consider the notion of a little rich girl realizing her dream of living happily ever after in a beautiful country house to be a tin-eared? The concept may have played marginally better in 1947, but that version starred Maureen O'Hara, and everything is better with Maureen O'Hara.
 "King Kong" (2005). I give Peter Jackson credit for his CGI work that gives Kong the scars borne of a turbulent life. The scene with Jack Black outracing a dinosaur stampede, however, is an abomination.
 "Ghostbusters" (2016). This one took heat from fanboys of the original who complained that the very existence of a women-only remake somehow corrupted a precious childhood memory. It was a bad movie regardless of gender, but not I-now-require-therapy bad.
 These only scratch the surface. Someday we'll have a long chat about what Tim Burton and Mark Wahlberg did to "Planet of the Apes."
 In fairness, some reboots work out just fine, though they may skip a generation to hit their stride. The character of Batman, reimagined by Tim Burton and Michael Keaton, turned out dandy under Chris Nolan after being strangled with his own cape by Joel Schumacher, and Spider-Man endured the Andrew Garfield years (after Toby Maguire) before finding new life with Tom Holland behind the mask.
 What might a 21st-century "Jaws" look like? The CGI shark will move too fluidly, kill too efficiently. The cast will be younger than Robert Shaw's boat shoes. And the mayor will be a slick, cartoonish weasel, not the two- packs-a-day champion of small business owners played by Murray Hamilton.
 In 1975, I stood in a line for "Jaws." In 2022, or whenever this shark thing is released, I just may be picketing it.

Head to the cellar of this 25-foot wide, six-level townhouse in Greenwich Village for its best asset. There, you’ll find an indoor pool — visible through floor-to-ceiling glass walls — that’s perfect for laps. What’s more: it’s naturally lit by skylights. The property, with eight bedrooms, was most recently listed for $21.5 million, but is now being quietly shopped off- market. Before then, it had been on and off the market since 2017, when it listed for $28 million. Post-swim, head to the roof, which has views of the Chrysler Building — and a hot tub to warm up.

After becoming GM of the Canadiens, Bergevin made a trade with the Blackhawks to acquire Shaw. After last season, Bergevin traded Shaw back to the Blackhawks, partly to free up salary-cap space and partly because of concerns about Shaw's history of concussions. It couldn't have been an easy decision for Bergevin, but unfortunately, it looks now like it was the right one.
 Shaw was not in the lineup when the Blackhawks played the Canadiens Wednesday night at the Bell Centre. The 28-year-old hasn't played since Nov. 30 and remains on the long-term injured reserve with a concussion. In his last game, Shaw took a high stick to the face from Colorado Avalanche defenceman Ryan Graves. The game before that, Shaw dropped the gloves and fought the 6-foot-5 Graves.
 Last season, Shaw was the Canadiens' nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which goes to an NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. After the announcement, Shaw said he didn't know how many concussions he had suffered during his hockey career, but figured he had three or four in the NHL.
 "Today, there's still a lot to learn (about concussions), obviously," Shaw said at the time. "In the back of your head that's always there that you might never be able to play hockey again."
 Shaw absolutely loves the game of hockey. He also loves his wife, Chaunette, and adores their 19-month-old daughter, Andy. Shaw's face would always light up in the Canadiens locker room when he would talk about his little girl.
 Shaw's teammates absolutely love him -- wherever he plays.
 "Shawzy does make a difference off the ice and on the ice," the Canadiens' Max Domi said earlier this season. "Playing cards with him and getting to know him away from the rink, he's a fun guy, he holds guys accountable and he wants to win. He's prepared to do whatever it takes and I think that's the most respect you can give someone is when they're literally willing to do absolutely anything for the team -- and that's who Andrew Shaw was."
 When Shaw was reminded about his junior fight with Tinordi after being nominated for the Masterton Trophy, he said: "To be honest, back then I was playing for the love of the game. Obviously, I still play for the love of the game. I just want to be part of a team, make some friends along the way. That was the type of style of hockey I always played. I think that's the way I was going to have success.
 "I always believed in myself," Shaw added. "I knew I worked harder than most, especially at that junior level. I knew I competed, I knew I was gritty, I knew I was a winner and I knew I could help a team win."
 Jordie Benn was Shaw's teammate with the Canadiens for three seasons before signing with the Vancouver Canucks as a free agent last summer. When the Canadiens were in Vancouver last month I asked Benn about Shaw and his most recent concussion.
 "He's played the game so hard," Benn said. "It's one of those things you don't mess around with your head. It's hard because you can't see the physical injury, but it's definitely there. It's one of those scary ones that one more concussion or one more bad hit to the head or something like that and you could be scrambled eggs. He's got a family to worry about and stuff like that. I mean I don't like saying it, but this is just a game. And he's so young that he's got a full life ahead of him. So I hope he's all right. I've kept in touch with him, too, he was a good buddy of mine there. So hopefully he's all right."
 I'm hoping the same thing.

MACOMB/MOLINE -- Enrollment remains an issue at Western Illinois University, but Interim President Martin Abraham believes that the institution is making progress.
 During Monday's back-to-school assembly, Abraham said that there are more admitted students for this fall than there were at this time last year. He also said that the university is introducing programs to make sure those students not only register, but also feel welcome once they become Leathernecks.
 There's a five percent increase in fall to spring new freshman retention compared to this time last year, which Abraham attributes to programs that help struggling students find guidance in the classroom.
 "We recognize the importance of every one of our students," Abraham said. "Everyone admitted to Western has a good chance to succeed."
 The university has experienced six straight semesters of declining enrollment, but Abraham believes that it's a trend that could soon be in Western's rearview mirror. He said that he plans to see a larger incoming class in the fall of 2020 than there was in the fall of 2019.
 "This remains our goal and a goal that remains well within our reach," he said.
 With an admissions staff that now processes applications more efficiently, Abraham believes that admitting more students to Western is a more-than- feasible goal.
 He referred to spring enrollment as "relatively strong" and said that the number of admitted freshman and transfer students declined less than what was projected. While he's encouraged by what he's seen with enrollment, he recognizes the need for even greater improvement.
 "We still have a long way to go and changes do not happen overnight," he said.
 He sees opportunities in recruiting more community college students to transfer to Western and he vowed to invest in new programs to expand what the university has to offer.
 Elsewhere, Abraham hopes that Western's financial woes will become less of a concern.
 "On the budget front, we have the opportunity to end the year in the black for the first time since fiscal year 2017," he said.
 The caveat to the potential fiscally-responsible year is that the university needs to spend under its operating and personnel budgets. Since funds from tuition remain low, Western's budgeted expense is greater than its actual revenue. But Abraham sees light at the end of the tunnel.
 "Because of your efforts to reduce expenditures, and the expectation that you will continue to identify opportunities to reduce costs, we do not need to take any extraordinary measures to further rein in spending," Abraham said.
 Community leaders like Representative Norine Hammond, Macomb Mayor Mike Inman, Macomb Police Chief Curt Barker, and Board of Trustees Chair Polly Radosh were in attendance for Abraham's speech.

When "Bad Boys," the cop-buddy film directed by Hollywood bad boy Michael Bay, and starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, was released 25 years ago, it took in just over $141 million at the box office. When "Bad Boys II," with the same directing-acting combo came out 17 years ago, ticket sales were $273 million. I didn't see either of those films until a week ago, when I sat down for a double feature on my living room couch.      And I liked them! A lot!! It was easy to see why they were such big hits. Both featured boatloads of action, breakneck editing, gobs of handleable violence, a steady thread of humor, snappy banter, a lush and richly saturated color scheme, and a believable and loving camaraderie between the two leads.      Over the years, I had also become - with the exception of his dizzyingly unwatchable "Transformers" films - an unabashed fan of Michael Bay. When I discovered he wasn't directing "Bad Boys for Life," and that it would be co- directed by the unfamiliar (to me) Adil El Arbi and Bilail Fallah, I had some negative thoughts.      But 10 minutes into it, and already caught up by all of the action, fast editing, violence, humor, camaraderie, etc., I knew I was in good hands. About 20 minutes later, when Michael Bay had a cameo as a wedding emcee, and I realized he had given the film his blessing (and later found out he produced it), I was settled in for the ride.      In fact, it opens with a ride - a wild one, with Mike Lowrey (Smith) at the wheel of his Porsche, zigzagging through a high-speed police chase in Miami, with his partner Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) in the passenger seat, screaming for him to slow down. But it turns out not to be a chase. It's a high-speed ride to a hospital, where Marcus' daughter is giving birth to his first grandson.      And so begins the story of what appears to be the dissolution of the partnership. Mike and Marcus have been together all these years, but now Marcus is considering retirement "because family is all that matters." To which Mike, with no thoughts of retirement, replies, "I'll be running down criminals till I'm 100!"      Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, there's a bloody jailbreak, a reunion of a vindictive mother and her murderous son, and a vengeful plan that includes making Mike the target of some bullets. With that plotline in play, it's safe to say that retirement is at least temporarily put on the backburner.      There's some dark, serious stuff going on here, but the writers and directors make sure to include a fair share of fun in the mix, and there's some funny crosscutting between action-man Mike still keeping up his old lifestyle and old-fashioned family man Marcus settling into his new one. To clarify, Mike wants revenge on those who tried to off him, and Marcus wants to enjoy life with his grandson.      Joe Pantoliano returns for his third portrayal of the overly excitable Captain Howard, a man who regularly needs a swig of Pepto Bismol whenever Mike goes rogue on him. Series newcomers Paola Nuñez, as the head of a special police team, and Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio, as the malevolent mother-son duo, are perfectly cast. But as with the first two entries, it's the onscreen relationship between Smith and Lawrence, the peanut butter and jelly of cop- buddy movies (that's a compliment), that makes the film work.      Their characters are similar in that they're committed to their jobs. They're different because ... well, Mike drives that Porsche, and Marcus drives his wife's Nissan Quest. The nice thing about them playing these action roles again after all this time is that they're convincing as a couple of guys who are too long in the tooth to do it, but can still do it. Will there be a "Bad Boys 4?" The script makes it feasible, but let's see how well this one does at the box office (my guess is very well).      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now.

On Jan. 9, 2020, Lakeland Police Department motorcycle officer Paul Dunn was killed in an early morning crash while driving to work. Paul was only 50 and has been with LPD for approximately five years. Paul also served proudly as a U.S. Marine.
   
 I recently spoke to Paul after an article was published in The Ledger regarding a lawsuit that was filed which claimed excessive force by LPD's responding officers. Paul was one of the officers named in the lawsuit.
   
 The lawsuit stemmed from a 2015 officer-involved shooting that Paul was involved in, where he was forced by the actions of the homeowner to utilize lethal force. I was very familiar with the shooting since I was Paul's Police Benevolent Association (PBA) representative that evening.
   
 Paul was very concerned with the way the article read, and was especially upset with the line "The lawsuit alleges Dunn, the officer who fired on Cook, was known by his supervisor and Lakeland city officials to have a violent history and issues."
   
 I told him that I was concerned over that allegation as well. I also told him that I was curious to find out about his "violent history" at LPD, and I was also curious to find out which supervisor and/or city official knew about it and condoned his behavior.
   
 Paul texted me back that he read the article over and over again, and that it really was bothering him. He texted, "I have been a cop for 20 years, and just like you and everyone else do the right thing, this really bothers me, it probably shouldn't but it does."
   
 I advised Paul that I was planning on reaching out to The Ledger's reporter, Sara-Megan Walsh, to discuss the article, and that specific line, and that I was planning to call LPD and pull his entire police personnel file. I told him that I needed to know all the facts about his past in law enforcement so I could speak on it if asked.
   
 I spoke to Ms. Walsh and she explained that the line in question was taken directly from the lawsuit which states "it is believed, and therefore averred that the Defendant Officers, and most especially Dunn, have a history of violence and Constitutional violations that were known to their supervisors, policy makers, and the other named defendants." Ms. Walsh explained that she was simply reporting from the lawsuit. Ms. Walsh explained her position quite well, and after the conversation, it was clear to me that the line was simply an opinion, lacking any sort of documentation to support it, from the attorney who authored the lawsuit.
   
 I expressed this to Paul, but it didn't lessen his frustration.
   
 I have known Paul for quite some time, and I knew he was a stand-up guy, and a really good police officer. In all my experiences while working for LPD, I never heard anyone say anything bad about Paul, his work ethic, or his "violent history." What struck me in my recent conversations and text messages with Paul was his passion to protect his name and the badge that he wears. That statement in the news article challenged his integrity, the integrity of law enforcement, and the integrity of the Lakeland Police Department. A lot of guys would simply brush a statement like that off, and wouldn't bother, but it really shows the true core of a person to really care about what the public thinks about you as a man, and as a law enforcement officer.
   
 I read Paul's file recently, and it was as I expected. It was full of awards and commendations, and excellent reviews from supervisors documenting Paul's work ethic and dedication to the job. Paul was a squared-up, professional cop - period.
   
 Oh, and I never did find one page or document that outlined any sort of violent behavior, or violent history, nor did I find any documents that any city official or supervisor knew or condoned such behavior.
   
 After I read it, I texted Paul the following "I read your files…..the only thing your bad at is driving LOL." Paul had a few write-ups for accidents while working in his marked patrol car. Paul texted back, "I drive better on 2 wheels."
   
 My last text to Paul was "Don't sweat it, you're a great cop, great recommendations and awards, and evaluations, proof is in the file."
   
 Paul died on Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.
   
 Rest in peace Paul. You served the city of Lakeland and the United States proudly. You did so with integrity class and dignity, and one does not need to read your personnel file to know that.
   
 Nick Marolda is president of the West Central Florida PBA and a retired Lakeland Police Department officer.

MOSCOW -- President Vladimir Putin accepted the resignation of his prime minister Wednesday after proposing constitutional amendments that could herald his intention to carve out a position that would let him stay at Russia's helm after his presidency ends.
   
 Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, who served as a placeholder president in 2008-2012 to allow Putin to observe term limits, said in televised comments that he needed to resign in light of his mentor's proposed changes in government.
   
 Putin thanked Medvedev for his work and appointed him as the deputy head of the presidential Security Council.
   
 In his state of the nation address earlier in the day, Putin suggested amending the constitution to allow lawmakers to name prime ministers and Cabinet members. The authority to make those appointments currently belongs to Russia's president.
   
 "It will increase the role of parliament and parliamentary parties, powers and independence of the prime minister and all Cabinet members," Putin told an audience of top officials and lawmakers.
   
 At the same time, Putin argued that Russia would not remain stable if it were governed under a parliamentary system. The president should retain the right to dismiss the prime minister and Cabinet ministers, to name top defense and security officials, and to be in charge of the Russian military and law enforcement agencies, he said.
   
 Putin emphasized that constitutional changes must be put to a nationwide vote.
   
 Putin's current term expires in 2024, and Russia's political elites have been abuzz with speculation about his future plans.
   
 The 67-year-old Putin has remained at the helm for more than 20 years -- longer than any other Russian or Soviet leader since Josef Stalin. He will have to step down after his term ends under the current law, which limits the president to two consecutive terms.
   
 Political analyst Kirill Rogov said that Putin's proposals indicate his intention to remain in charge while re-distributing powers between various branches of government.
   
 "Such a model resembling the Chinese one would allow Putin to stay at the helm indefinitely while encouraging rivalry between potential successors," Rogov said on Facebook.
   
 Alexei Navalny, the most prominent Russian opposition leader, tweeted that the president's speech signaled Putin's desire to continue calling the shots after his term ends.
   
 "The only goal of Putin and his regime is to stay in charge for life, having the entire country as his personal asset and seizing its riches for himself and his friends," Navalny alleged.
   
 Putin served two presidential terms in 2000-2008 before shifting into the prime minister's seat for four years to observe the term limit. Medvedev kept his seat warm and then stepped down after just one term to allow his mentor to reclaim the top job in 2012. While in office, Medvedev raised the presidential term from four to six years.
   
 While Putin continued calling the shots during Medvedev's presidency, he wasn't quite happy with his performance. He was particularly critical of Medvedev's decision to give the green light to the Western air campaign over Libya in 2011 that led to the ouster and the killing of long-time dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
   
 Medvedev's decision to step down after one term to let Putin return to the presidency also sparked massive protests in Moscow in 2011-2012 in a major challenge to the Kremlin.
   
 Observers speculated that Putin may stay in charge after 2024 by shifting into the prime minister's seat after increasing the powers of parliament and the Cabinet and trimming presidential authority.
   
 Political analyst Dmitry Oreshkin said Putin's speech made it clear he was pondering the move to premiership.
   
 "Putin is advancing the idea of keeping his authority as a more powerful and influential prime minister while the presidency will become more decorative," Oreshkin said.
   
 Other potential options include a merger with neighboring Belarus that would create a new position of the head of a new unified state -- a prospect rejected by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
   
 In his address, Putin said the constitution must also specify the authority of the State Council consisting of regional governors and top federal officials.
   
 Some analysts have theorized that Putin may try to continue pulling the strings as head of the council after stepping down as president in 2024.
   
 Putin also emphasized the need to amend the constitution to give it a clear priority over international law.
   
 "The requirements of international law and treaties and decisions of international organs can only be valid on the territory of Russia as long as they don't restrict human rights and freedoms and don't contradict the constitution," he said.
   
 He also said that the constitution must be tweaked to say that top government officials aren't allowed to have foreign citizenship or residence permits.
   
 Putin focused his state of the nation address on the need to encourage population growth by offering additional subsidies to families that have children.
   
 The Russian leader said that Russia would remain open for cooperation with all countries while maintaining a strong defense capability to fend off potential threats.
   
 He added that new weapons systems would protect Russia's security "for decades ahead."
   
 "For the first time in history, we aren't trying to catch up with anyone," Putin said. "On the contrary, other leading nations are yet to develop the weapons that Russia already has."
