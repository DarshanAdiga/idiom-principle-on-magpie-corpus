With a premise this absurd and jokes that can seem dated, the directing, especially regarding physical comedy, can make or break the show. My hat is off to Kelli Workman, assistant director/choreographer Thea Hinojosa, and assistant choreographer Jessica Lumm for their inventive and humorous direction. There's one bit in "I Am So Proud" that makes me cry-laugh to remember: the song was so well executed by Tyler Gastelum (Pooh-Bah), Jacob Walters (Pish-Tush), and Tyler Wright (Ko-Ko) due to their great chemistry as this trio of buffoons. I also noticed many people in the audience were clearly hearing these jokes for the first time, and their genuinely delighted reactions were wonderful for me to experience as someone who knows the text well.

London's Tobacco Dock is one of those old buildings made new with glass fittings and big windows. Yesterday, it was the new venue for a long-established event; the Guinness Six Nations launch and the unfamiliar surrounds were somehow fitting considering the host of fresh faces dancing the dance for the first time. For seven seasons, the clean-cut, boyish face of Joe Schmidt looked down from the top table alongside Paul O'Connell and Rory Best. Yesterday, it was the bearded Andy Farrell who peered out from above his IRFU tie and alongside him was the familiar figure of Johnny Sexton as they moved from glass cage to glass cage to face different versions of the same questions from the various media platforms. Eventually, they arrived in the writers' room for their last formal engagement before they departed for their Algarve training camp. Before departure, there was a little bit of old ground to cover. While this is a new beginning for the Ireland team, the context of their terrible World Cup performance and general 2019 decline hangs over them ahead of their new beginning. Schmidt touched on it in his book, Best has had his say and the IRFU review outlined the official line on what went wrong in Japan. There will be no redemption this spring, says Sexton. "It's hard because the real amends will be made in four years' time," he said of the latest quarter-final exit. "Whether you're there or not is another thing. It could have been a lot of our last World Cup, but you get to the stage where you know a sporting career has ups and downs. "You never just have all successes, you never have all successes, you just learn that these bumps come, and sometimes they come along when you least expect them or you're when you are in your best form or your best shape, and suddenly things just don't go to plan. "And it's just knowing that, knowing it's part of the journey and it's sort of easier to accept then and move on. But it's not easy, there's plenty of nights I lay awake, going, 'What just happened? What went wrong? How did it go wrong?' "And you mull over these things for ages, and I've been lucky that I had some good chats with Faz (Farrell), with Stuart (Lancaster) when I got back to Leinster and he had some good experience from being with England in 2015, and he kinda put everything into context for us. "So it's been a good learning curve, even though you don't want it to be." The question of Sexton being around in 2023 is one of the big issues surrounding his captaincy. No one doubts his playing or leadership ability, and he remains the class out- half in the squad, but he will be 38 when France rolls around. He is the captain for this window and this window alone, but if he does a good job it's unlikely that Farrell will seek to change. "I've talked about how I want to play as long as I can because I love what I do," he said. "I wouldn't change it for anything, maybe for being a golfer, but other than that. I love being in the sport, I love everything that goes with it and I want to play for as long as possible. "But you can be 24, sat here and wanting to play until you're 35 or 36 but you could be finished tomorrow, you don't know, so there's no point in me continuing to talk about it, I've just got to enjoy this Six Nations. "I'm here next year once injury doesn't stop me and I'll just continue to build season on season and try to produce the goods, keep the mind good and body good and I don't see why not. But there are other people who have a lot to do with it as well. "But the day that guys in the game that I respect say, 'Look, I think you've had enough', I'll listen and I'll go. I'll go kicking and screaming but I'll go. A lot has to happen." Leinster captain last season, Sexton led Ireland for the first time against Russia at the World Cup. Leadership There have been ups and downs, but the skipper says he has worked hard to improve his leadership. "That's probably up to other people to answer that. I've tried to get better," he said. "Leadership is the same as any other part of my game, I've had to get better over the years. "I've had to change, I've had to adapt to being an older guy in the squad. I've still got that drive in me but how I portray that to other people is more important than it was. "I've had to get better and change and I hope I've done that, I've learned some good lessons with Leinster over three seasons when I started having captaincy responsibilities with Isa (Nacewa) and then after Isa… I learned a lot off the captains I played under and I'll try to take bits off them. "But it's important I'm myself. You've got to try to be true to yourself. That's what I'll try to do but I will try to get better. I'll try to do that with every part of my game until I retire." The captaincy is new, but Sexton has been a senior figure in the Ireland set-up for almost a decade and will want to put his own stamp on the role. One of Best's critiques of the 2019 decline was that the players ceded ground to the coaches and looked to Schmidt for guidance too frequently. He feels his friend and predecessor's words were misconstrued, but accepts that the players must take more ownership in driving the team during this Six Nations. "I spoke to Rory about that and I think an element of that was him trying to put it on himself, him trying to say that he maybe got a little bit wrong," he said. "We spoke about that, we wanted to be more... not that it wasn't player-driven in the past but that we wanted it to be even more player-driven. "That's bring driven by Faz, he wants us to do it together, for the team to be accountable to each other and very much we do something similar in Leinster where the leadership group have a strong voice with the coaches. "We had a strong voice before but I think those comments probably got blown out of proportion with the IRFU review at the same time and it all blew up. "What I think he was trying to do there was say the leadership group needed to be better and he needed to do more. I know it got pointed at Joe but that wasn't the intention of Rory, I don't think." Best's time is over, Sexton is the figurehead of a new squad in a new tournament. There may be no World Cup redemption on offer, but that hasn't lessened his desire to win in a green shirt.

MIAMI (AP) — Tyler Herro scored 25 points, Jimmy Butler scored nine of his 24 points in overtime and the Miami Heat wasted a 21-point lead before beating the Washington Wizards 134-129 on Wednesday night. The Heat improved to 20-1 at home and 8-0 in overtime this season. Bradley Beal led the Wizards with 38 points on 16 for 24 shooting.KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs saw value in a trio of players that were essentially castoffs from what was one of the least-successful franchises in the NFL over the past 10 years in Damien Williams, Matt Moore and Jordan Lucas. Their decision to pick them up when just about nobody else was calling is a big reason why they're playing in the Super Bowl. Williams has turned into their top running back, Moore played crucial games when Patrick Mahomes was hurt, and Lucas has been a valuable player on special teams while providing depth at safety this season.HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) — Authorities say a warrant has been issued for the arrest of NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown following accusations that he and his trainer attacked another man near Brown's Florida home. Hollywood police say Brown faces charges of burglary with battery, burglary of an unoccupied conveyance and criminal mischief. Officers say they responded Tuesday afternoon to a disturbance call, where the alleged victim said Brown and his trainer, Glen Holt, hit him. Holt was arrested a short time later and charged with one count of burglary with battery. Police say officers attempted to make contact with Brown but were unsuccessful.MIAMI (AP) — Goran Dragic is not going to change his mind about playing international basketball again. He is not going to play for Slovenia in this summer's Olympic qualifying tournament and won't be part of the Tokyo Games if his nation qualifies. Dragic spent more than a decade on his national team and led Slovenia to the 2017 European championship.UNDATED (AP) — Brett Favre sees some of his own traits as a football player in Patrick Mahomes. The mobility and passing outside the pocket, usually on the run. The willingness to stick with a play and see if it can develop into something grand. The howitzer of an arm. The Hall of Fame quarterback, who is appearing weekly on SiriusXM NFL Radio for a third NFL season, isn't exactly looking into a mirror when he watched Mahomes. But it isn't far off.ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Dennis Schroder scored 31 points and the Oklahoma City Thunder shot 60.5% against one of the NBA's better defenses and beat the Orlando Magic 120-114. Chris Paul added 19 points and six assists for Oklahoma City, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 18 points and 12 rebounds. Terrence Ross scored 26 points and Nikola Vucevic added 24 points and 11 rebounds for Orlando, which had allowed an NBA-low 103.9 points per game.NEW YORK (AP) — Derek Jeter and Larry Walker rarely crossed paths during their time in the major leagues. One was a first-round bonus baby who won five World Series titles with the New York Yankees, the other a youth hockey player who took up baseball at age 16. Now they are heading to the Hall of Fame together, Jeter one vote short of unanimous and Walker by just six votes in his 10th and final appearance on the writers' ballot.LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — The Pro Bowl gives NFL players a chance to swap spots. The annual all- star game looked like a backyard pickup contest last year. Trick plays and guys out of position were more prevalent than deep balls and defensive indifference. Tennessee defensive tackle Jurrell Casey says "I don’t think it hurts nobody.” It might just be the evolution of the exhibition game that’s become less intense over the years. There’s little, if any, tackling and barely any contact along the lines of scrimmage. It often looks more like a walk-through than a workout. So players are trying to spice things up.

But the Tons gave high-flying Walthamstow a fright, before seeing two men sent off and conceding three late goals in a 6-2 defeat. The Foxes, meanwhile, saw hopes of a semi-final place in the Errington Challenge Cup ended by a 4-1 loss at Hadley. Clapton stunned promotion-chasing Walthamstow at their temporary Southchurch Park home to race into a 2-0 lead, with a near-post finish after a good passing move and long-range effort. But Jamie Bennett headed home a cross from Skeels to halve the deficit just before the break and give the visitors a boost for the second half. And Clapton, already down to 10 men due to a sin-bin offence, were forced to put an outfield player in goal after the restart with Williiam Hunt suffering an injury. The hosts were reduced to nine men by a straight red card and Stow levelled with a penalty from Dwade James, after his goalbound header was handled by a defender, who was given his marching orders for a second bookable offence to reduce Tons to nine permanently. And it was 3-2 when James converted from the spot once again, after he himself and been challenged in the box. Clapton went down to eight men after another sin-bin offence and Charlie Yexley crossed for Gebrai Samrai to loop a header into the net for a fourth Stow goal. Lewis Francis and Yexley then combined for Callum Ibe to strike home a fifth and more good work on the wing by Francis set up Samrai, who fired a shot on the turn through the stand-in keeper's legs. Ilford fell behind against Hadley at Brickfield Lane as Solomon Ofori fired home after good work from Sam Edwards. Yemi Buramioh doubled the advantage before half- time and Ofori tapped in a third from Bradley Marriott's cross after the restart. Ofori completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot to make it 4-0, before Noel Omondi grabbed a consolation for Jonny Fowell's Ilford. Friday night sees Tower Hamlets host Southend Manor and Woodford Town entertain Hashtag United in their next fixtures. Clapton travel to Sawbridgeworth Town, while Ilford visit West Essex and Redbridge go to Enfield for what will be the 400th match of manager Micky Wetherall's career.
