BROTHERSVALLEY TOWNSHIP — Anyone who drives along the narrow, winding township road just off of U.S. Route 219 immediately finds themselves whisked back in time, if only for a moment, as their car enters the Burkholder Bridge.
 The 150-year-old structure has cherry-red shingles; a charming sign bearing its name across the arc of the roof; and alabaster white sidewalls, which are distinctive because their openness allows much of the structure to be exposed. In theory, some would say this covered bridge has surpassed its usefulness in the modern world. Its 3-ton weight limit and 8-foot height limit restrict many vehicles from passing over Buffalo Creek.
 Like some things in this country that are past their expiration date, it has been preserved. As times change with new industries, technologies and opportunities, many other relics have been removed from our landscape and our memories. Or they’ve decayed in front of us as change and neglect forced them to rot back into the earth.
 Change is like that. Tiny towns like this one in Somerset County, and larger towns such as Cumberland, Maryland, or the Ohio towns of Youngstown and East Liverpool, once had very different purposes. As the world changed and moved forward, it left them behind.
 Cumberland was once the second-largest city in Maryland. It was the gateway to the West, the jewel of the American frontier, the center of the railroad industry.
 East Liverpool was once the Pottery Capital of America, with over 300 pottery companies manufacturing the finest china in the world. Last week, in the midst of all the calamity that is the coronavirus pandemic, the Hall China Company, which has been there for more than 100 years, was bought by a company that will produce the iconic dinnerware in England, Mexico and China.
 Youngstown was the center of this country’s manufacturing universe for more than 100 years. You can thank Youngstown and every town up and down the Steel Valley for supplying not just the materials but also the blood and sweat that built this country from the dawn of the Industrial Revolution to the post- World War II building boom.
 These are the cities and towns and counties that for years have scrambled to hold on to the churches that anchored their neighborhoods; the barbershops that served their families for three generations; and the family restaurants where they had their weekly night on the town and their kids had their first part-time job.
 They were the places where fathers and grandfathers staffed men’s guilds to support the local parish festivals, where the women’s guilds planted flowerbeds to beautify the towns and where the youth groups cleaned up litter dumped on roads by strangers passing through.
 They held on dearly to the local institutions as long as they could or wept as they shuttered along with the manufacturing employers. All the while, they were made to feel backward or foolish for wanting to hold on to the past. The cosmopolitan class mocked them for not moving away from a dying town or adapting to change faster.
 When we come out of this pandemic, no matter where we live, whether it’s New York City or Newville, Pennsylvania, our landscape and society will have changed forever.
 That dry cleaner where you dropped your shirts off to be pressed every week may never open its doors again. The deli that makes your favorite tuna melt might not have one ready for you right as you walk in the door every Friday at lunchtime. The waitress who knew you by name may have moved back home with her parents because she couldn’t afford that apartment anymore, even when she shared it with three other girls.
 The economic and emotional change we typically see in this country is a slow erosion of a town, city or village. First comes the loss of major employment, and if there is nothing to replace it, then comes the collapse of the place. For people rooted in the Cumberlands, Youngstowns and Brothersvalleys of this country, these places have value because that rootedness defines them.
 Now the coronavirus pandemic is accelerating that erosion up to warp speed.
 Maybe it will eliminate one aspect of that divide between the placed and the placeless, the latter of whom enjoy a mobile life and focus on lofty ideals and global policies. The placeless may find themselves understanding how the placed have felt all along, worrying about crumbling institutions all around them and the long-term damage to their community and city.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter found in the brain that serves many purposes. It is linked to memory, attention, productivity and weight loss along with an important role in restricting impulsive behaviour and preventing Parkinsons disease.According to a study based on COVID-19, the coronavirus is likely to alter the dopamine pathways in the brain. 1 Another study on SARS says about the change in neurons and nerve fibres in the brain causing problems like encephalitis. 2 nbsp;As COVID-19 is believed to be similar to SARS, it is likely to affect the functioning of the brain negatively.Boosting dopamine levels in our body through diet is the best way to prevent such viral diseases. When dopamine level are high, it affects the pleasure centre in the brain causing improved mood and motivation. Lack of dopamine in our body can lead to a lack of enthusiasm, depression, cold feet, low sex drive, mental fatigue, lack of focus and others. Take a look at the foods that help boost the dopamine levels in our body. Protein is essential for increasing the dopamine levels in our body. Tyrosine is an amino acid that helps in building proteins, which in turn, helps in the production of dopamine. Almonds are packed with tyrosine, which is why it is considered the best snack for the production of 'happy hormone in our body. 3 Fruits like banana contain tyrosine along with a flavonoid called quercetin. Both of them excessively help in the production of dopamine. Apart from that, banana also contains multiple vitamins that help in maintaining good health of the brain. Dairy products like milk and yoghurt contain important amino acids like phenylalanine, tyrosine and pregnenolone. They are the building blocks of dopamine as well as essential hormones in the body. The best thing is these products are easily available and are cost-effective. 4 DHA or Docosahexaenoic acid is a type of omega-3 fatty acid mostly found in fish like salmon, mackerel, sardine and herring. DHA helps improve the dopamine level in the body along with treating medical conditions like ADHD and dementia. Coffee contains caffeine which is known to act as a stimulant of the central nervous system. This is because the caffeine helps in the release of dopamine in the brain causing alertness and focus. Tea, green tea (with caffeine) and dark chocolates are also the best sources of caffeine. 5 Grapes contain a vital antioxidant called resveratrol which helps to spike up the dopamine levels in the brain. Antioxidants also help in preventing cell death by reducing the oxidative stress in the body. 6 They are rich in flavonoids, anthocyanin and antioxidants that help preserve the health of the brain and regulate the production of dopamine. Blueberries also help prevent Parkinsons diseases by reducing the oxidative stress in Substantia Nigra and Striatum regions of the brain. 7 Spinach or other green vegetables are mainly known for the production of serotonin, a similar neurotransmitter to dopamine. They are also packed with tyrosine which plays an important role in stimulating the dopamine levels in the brain. 8 Uridine in mushrooms helps restore the dopamine levels in the brain. It plays an active role in the synthesis of new dopamine receptors along with improving memory and alertness. Mushrooms also help treat mental conditions like depression and mood change. Oats are rich in complex carbohydrates that regulate the production of tryptophan, an amino acid that helps in the production of serotonin. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also known as a 'happy hormone that helps regulate mood, emotional connection, appetite and many others.

Chislom still thinks of his days as a Spartan, playing for head coach Jeff Meinholdt. He said his sophomore year was a memorable one as McFarland beat East Troy twice and ended up 14-2 in the Rock Valley Conference to end in a first-place tie with Evansville.
 In Chislom’s junior year, he averaged 14.5 points and 7.6 rebounds per game to earn a spot on the All-Rock Valley Conference first team.
 As a senior, Chislom made a repeat appearance on the first team after he averaged 23.1 points and 10 rebounds per game. He thrilled Spartan supporters with a variety of two-hand dunks.
 He said Meinholdt taught him a lot about basketball and helped mold him into a college athlete.
 “He taught me that basketball isn’t only about scoring, it’s about how you carry yourself and how you show people who you are,” Chislom said. “That stuck with me throughout my high school career and made me into the person I am today.”
 With classes suspended at UW-Whitewater due to the spread of the coronavirus and Gov. Tony Evers’ safer-at-home restrictions, Chislom now spends a lot of quality with his brother Sean, also a basketball star at McFarland and a recent graduate of Dalton State University in Georgia, where he played for the men’s basketball team.
 The two have shared many stories about their basketball playing experiences, and periodically get into a friendly game of one-on-one.
 “He beats me, because he has a lot more experience,” said Trevon Chislom. “But I’ll get there eventually.”

There are manpower concerns, but also issues with false positives and false negatives and a rash of other challenges. Most medical tests give false results. It's been suggested coronavirus tests are even less reliable. That presents a danger if people go to get tested, get a negative result, and then act as if they're in the clear. Similarly, false positive results suck up resources as confirmation tests are made. Those are small challenges individually, but if you test even 10,000 people every day, all those false results can have a destabilizing effect.

The implication is, as we have seen, that the debt could be paid off at a fairly modest cost in higher tax rates, as noted above about 2.3 pence on the standard rate. For those puzzled by this arithmetic and worried there is sleight of hand, a transparent way of doing all this would be to issue new debt worth 14% of GDP to pay off the existing debt at market value; and to create a sinking fund sufficient to pay off this newly issued debt. This sinking fund would be funded in turn by a tax rise, whose proceeds would go entirely to paying off this debt. The necessary tax rise is as we have seen 0.7% of GDP, about 2.3 pence on the standard rate: the present value of this tax stream discounted at 5% is exactly the 14% of GDP required.

 Republican leaders in the Senate and Assembly immediately rebuked Evers' order.

Just last week a federal judge said he did not have the power to cancel the election and Governor Evers doesn’t either."
 Evers said his order to delay the election was based on advice from the Department of Health Services. He added that, while health officials in some states have altered election rules due to the pandemic, he felt it was important that he take the charge in Wisconsin.
 “In-person voting would, without question accelerate the transmission of COVID-19 and increase the number of cases,” DHS Secretary Andrea Palm said. “And increases in the number of cases in Wisconsin would result in more deaths.”
