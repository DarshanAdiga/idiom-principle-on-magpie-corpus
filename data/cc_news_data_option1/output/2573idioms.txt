Dr. Peter Horby, who is running a large clinical trial testing several treatments for COVID-19, told the BBC that ‚Äúa stronger framework‚Äù was needed to ensure fair prices and access to key medicines for people and nations around the world. He said that as an American company, Gilead was likely under ‚Äúcertain political pressures locally.‚Äù
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman, James Slack, declined to criticize the United States for the move, but said the U.K. had a stockpile of remdesivir.
 ‚ÄúThe U.K. has been using remdesivir for some time, first in trials and now in the ‚ÄòEarly Access to Medicines Scheme,'" he said.
 He added that Britain had a ‚Äúsufficient stock‚Äù of remdesivir for patients who need it, but didn't specify how much that was.
 Thomas Senderovitz, head of the Danish Medicines Agency, told Danish broadcaster DR that the move could endanger Europeans and others down the road.
 ‚ÄúI have never seen anything like that. That a company chooses to sell their stock to only one country. It‚Äôs very strange and quite inappropriate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRight now we have enough to make it through the summer if the intake of patients is as it is now. If a second wave comes, we may be challenged.‚Äù

But, of course, no one is surprised. In our brave, new world, logical inconsistencies are par for the course. In fact, Gorsuch is not the first to opine that ‚Äúsex discrimination‚Äù includes any legal recognition of the unalterable fact of sex. The theory has been around since 1975, when he was in third grade. Moreover, his fellow justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has spent 45 years arguing against it!
 Gorsuch asserts that this self-contradictory opinion is driven by strict and principled ‚Äútextualism.‚Äù But he never once uses the word, ‚Äúoriginalism.‚Äù It would be better described as ‚Äúpre-textualism,‚Äù because he has no intention of determining the original meaning of the text.
 First, neither ‚Äúhomosexual‚Äù nor ‚Äútranssexual‚Äù is, in fact, in the text. Second, multiple legislators over the course of 45 years have proposed changes in the text precisely because the text does not address homosexuality and transsexuality. Third, his concurring justices, Kagan, Breyer, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, have a long and proud history of defying textualism at every turn.
 I am not pointing out anything that the majority didn‚Äôt already know. They are extremely smart and capable lawyers. Doubtless, Alito, Thomas and Kavanaugh have been reminding them of the logical, constitutional and legal problems for the past several months.
 They knew full well that their opinion would require decades of litigation costing millions. They knew that countless doctors, churches, businesses and charities would be sued into oblivion.
 They also could have explicitly limited Gorsuch‚Äôs theory to Title VII alone. But the majority refused to rule out any of the 167 new applications, while also refusing to admit that they would all logically follow.
 This is now a Humpty Dumpty court. ‚ÄúWhen I use a word,‚Äù Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‚Äúit means just what I choose it to mean ‚Äì neither more nor less.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe question is,‚Äù said Alice, ‚Äúwhether you can make words mean so many different things.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe question is,‚Äù said Humpty Dumpty, ‚Äúwhich is to be master ‚Äì that‚Äôs all.‚Äù
 The Bostock majority is now that master. That is all.

SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) ‚Äî Back in March as the coronavirus pandemic gathered steam in the U.S., a largely unheralded video-conferencing service suddenly found itself in the spotlight.
 And just as quickly as Zoom became a household name for connecting work colleagues, church and school groups, friends, family, book clubs and others during stay-at-home lockdowns, it also gained a reputation for lax security as intrusive ‚Äúvideobombers‚Äù barged into private meetings or just spied on intimate conversations.
 On April 1, following a wave of lawsuits over privacy breaches, CEO Eric Yuan ordered a halt to work on new features and vowed to fix the service's weaknesses in 90 days. That time is up, and Zoom is ready to take a bow.
 The work on ‚Äúsecurity and privacy is never going to be done, but it is now embedded in how we approach everything we do at Zoom now,‚Äù the company‚Äôs chief financial officer, Kelly Steckelberg, told The Associated Press in a recent interview. Zoom hailed some of the strides that it says it has made in a Wednesday blog post.
 The most visible changes included a switch that automatically protected all meetings with passwords and kept all participants in a digital waiting room until the meeting host let them in.
 Behind the scenes, Yuan began meeting regularly with a council consisting of top security executives in the tech industry and brought in former Yahoo and Facebook executive Alex Stamos as a special consultant. He also conferred with other supportive executives such as Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who took the unusual step of posting a video hailing Zoom as an ‚Äúessential service."

Since the game has been available in Japan since 2017 as a Nexon release, there are no surprises when it comes to the title's gameplay. This is a standard gacha game, and since it's already three years old, it already shows its age. This means you can expect numerous load screens, though it would appear auto-combat is included out of the box (well, you unlock it after a brief tutorial), which means everyone should be able to grind with ease. So far, drop rates don't appear to be that bad, though the game can be pretty dull the majority of the time since it's pretty simplistic. Much like every other free-to-play RPG, you'll select cards at the bottom of the screen that will pull off moves against your enemies, and that's about it. Sure, you'll get to upgrade and combine your weapons, and since there are over 150 to collect, there's a little bit of depth here, but as far as gacha games go, SINoALICE is pretty simplistic.

 Especially since they had shown the confidence earlier in the game. After cutting the Sabers‚Äô lead to one, the Indians had recorded three quick outs in the bottom half of the sixth in order to give themselves a chance.
 ‚ÄúI think it shows a lot of character on our team,‚Äù Cochran said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something we‚Äôre expecting now and we just have to find ways to scratch and claw and get those runs back.‚Äù
 Zach Erwin took the mound for the Indians and gave he Sabers some fits. Erwin held the Sabers to just four hits while striking out four. It was just the third time this season that the Sabers scored three runs or less.
 ‚ÄúHe did a great job,‚Äù DeWitt‚Äôs Coach Sikkema said about Erwin. ‚ÄúWe swung at a lot of non-strikes I thought, and if we had better pitch selection it could have been a better game today but hitting is a hard thing and we talk about it and trying to get good counts.‚Äù
 Other than one fielding error and the hit batters, the Sabers put together a clean ballgame.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all pitching a defense,‚Äù Sikkema said. ‚ÄúAnd then we hope to hit the ball enough to win. We talked about not making errors, not hitting or walking batters. We have a decent pitching staff and our defense can support them out there as well.‚Äù
