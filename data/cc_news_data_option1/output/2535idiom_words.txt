It is important for an actor to know his limits, but it is equally important for him to know just he could push yourself a bit further. When Akshay decided to do last year’s 2.0 directed by Shankar, he became the first Bollywood A-lister who gave his nod to play an antagonist in a film down South. Seen in elaborate makeovers, Akshay could bring thrill, and held his own as bad guy, mutant bird-lover Pakshi Rajan.

Since 2014, Akshay has featured in 11 films that have cashed in on the nationalistic flavour. With national pride being the main plot of eight out of his last 10 films, it has been slightly tough to differentiate one Kumar film from another. While Manoj Kumar went the patriotic route in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which was later followed by Sunny Deol in the 1990s and early 2000s, it is Akshay who is trying his best to emerge as the undisputed king of patriotism.

With the kind of projects that are being released, it is indeed the right time for actors to come out of their comfort zone and take some risks. And Akshay has time and again proved just how interesting it is to venture out into the unknown. He may have debuted as an action hero, and established himself as the Khiladi of Bollywood, flirted with romance in Yeh Dillagi, and even lost the girl in Dil Toh Pagal Hai. But his willingness to do Priyadarshan’s Hera Pheri brought to the fore his funny side, something he cashed in on for years. Such was their association that Priyadarshan and Akshay delivered several hits like Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhaag, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, Khatta Meetha & De Dana Dan, and worked as a team for over a decade.
