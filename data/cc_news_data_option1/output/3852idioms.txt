Wow After sentencing, Melanie Mcguire was taken to the Edna Mahan correctional facility in Clinton, New Jersey. Her new home would be a six by It's just beginning for us now. We'll never give up. We will never, ever give up for her until the truth comes out. On "Direct appeal" we exane the murder conviction of Melanie Mcguire. This is a prepaid call from Melanie Mcguire. An inmate at Edna Mahan correctional facility. All right, obviously Melanie's been convicted. She's exhausted all of her appeals at this point. So how did the idea for this podcast come about? Melanie Mcguire was looking to speak with someone about her story, because she had done really poorly in the court system, and I think she was frustrated. And after visiting with her the first time I was like, this a story. This is important. I expected the worst and what I got was just one step shy. They give the verdict, parole eligible at the tender age of 101. It was very difficult. It was reliving it. This was the first time somebody was basically saying, we hear you. What do you say? Let's get to the juicy part. I want to know. Do you think she is innocent or guilty? In the end I believe that Melanie Mcguire was wrongfully convicted. So, you believe an innocent woman is behind bars right now? Absolutely. I believe this is a case of a wrongful conviction. So, let's talk about some of the questions you raise in your podcast, and let's begin with the gun. The gun, to this day, has never been recovered. One of the key witnesses for the prosecution was a forensic ballistic expert. These are two discharged bullets. They're referred to as a .38 caliber lead wad cutter bullet. Is it possible that the gun Melanie bought is not actually the murder weapon? I think it's probable. No one plugged the serial number of my gun into a website to find out what the specifications were. Apparently each gun makes something called lands and grooves. Lands and grooves are rifling characteristics that are machine- pressed into the barrel of a gun, and when the bullet passes through the barrel, the same number of lands and grooves are going to be imprinted, essentially, onto that bullet. There were five lands and grooves that my weapon was said to have made based on the company's website. The bullets that came out of my husband had six lands and grooves. It was a mistake on a gun manufacturer's website. We were not gathering evidence from a gun manufacturer's website. The evidence that was at trial was from ballistic experts. But the website was updated. It was. After this trial to incorporate the possibility that it could have five or six. Five or six, yeah. I thought that was questionable. I think it's very questionable that for years, historically it says one thing, and then it's updated right after. Let's talk about the garbage bags. The prosecution had an expert that said that the garbage bag in which bill's body was found in was consistent with the garbage bags that came from Melanie's apartment. You can see these lines here is a straight line here, this sort of smooth line. There's also two other lines close together in basically the exact same position. This indicates that these two bags were made at the same facility on the same line within a very close proximity of time. He ran tests. But he didn't do all the tests that you actually need to definitively say whether these bags match. Even his own data shows that they probably weren't the same bags. Well, there are all these other tests that can be done in any analysis. Based on the testing we had conducted and the results that I observed, I felt confident at that time to conclude that the bags were produced during the same run. They put on a really good show. And I think when you have props, two garbage bags -- oh, wow, those do look alike. And so what the jurors are listening to sounds like fact, when, in reality, it's just someone's expert opinion. There is something else that's significant that you think the jury should have heard more about. It was found inside those If you look through the lab reports, page upon page upon page -- white hair, brown hair, black hair, animal hair. I think that's more indicative that there was animal hair where the dismemberment of bill's body. You mentioned that you found some animal hairs. Did you find anything that you considered of evidential value? No. They looked high and low to connect Melanie to some pet, and once they found that there was no way to connect Melanie to these pet hairs, it became not of evidentiary value. Why is that? Simply because they don't match your suspects? Those hair should have been tested, because that's a huge question mark. Melanie did not incapacitate, shoot, use a saw to dismember her husband. Do you know how hard it is to cut through bone? It is physically exhausting. And also, if the crime scene didn't happen there and she's home with her children all nigh, where is this happening? There are just too many holes in this story. In this case with the mountain of evidence against her and a very complex plan, I submit to you it's amazing we know as much as we do. This was a murder trial. It wasn't a contest to see who could outsmart the investigators, and if someone is smart enough to successfully hide a crime scene that they win. Did you find any evidence that exonerates Melanie, that proves her innocence? I wish we did. Had hoped we would. I still think we might get a tip in that direction. What do you say to the people at home who watch this and say, how dare she talk from prison and bring this all back up again? Enough pain has already befallen her husband's family, her own sons. There's a murder walking around. Even if we discount what's happened to me, the killer is out there, and it's not me. She had about as good a counsel as money could buy. She certainly had a fair and impartial jury. The fact of the matter is, sometimes the evidence is such that your attorneys, no matter what you pay them, they simply cannot overcome what you have done. She can say whatever she wants. She's a liar and a killer. Today your boys are young men. They are. Is there anything you want to Imagine a future where one day machine learning

Sexuality becomes her weapon of choice, her identity, her claim to fame. But she thrives only till she does not pay much heed to the defamatory media coverage. A minor dip in confidence leads to a downward spiral, and Smitha ends up killing herself. The Dirty Picture chronicled how the celebration of ones sexuality, particularly that of a woman who is an outsider in a field, often gets derailed and slandered by constant scrutiny; how the embracing of ones sexuality is inextricably linked with the what will people say syndrome. However, a dialogue by Rajat Arora in the film also ensures that a mirror is held to the prying eyes of society: Jab sharafat ke kapde utarte hain, tab sabse zyada mazza shareefon ko hi aata hai.

With the relief sale just a week away, preparations have shifted into high gear, seeking to work around the obstacles brought on by the continuing coronavirus.
 A “Sharing Our Surplus” refugee relief walk took place Aug. 23 in Harrisonburg spearheaded by Harvey Yoder and his committee. Some 100 people walked a 2.3-mile self-guided route through downtown Harrisonburg, while others walked at other times and distances or gave online, raising a total of $15,000 for MCC.
 The annual “My Coins Count” project has been underway for weeks. Area congregations and businesses are finding different ways to collect coins and currency in large plastic jugs (normally done during Sunday worship services). The funds raised will be divided between MCC and local causes through Virginia Mennonite Missions. Last year’s drive raised $24,804.
 The main sale event, the annual auction of handmade quilts, wall hangings, knotted comforters and afghans, artwork and wooden handcrafted items will take place online only starting at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 3. Once an item is bid on, others will have one minute to continue bidding until the bidding is final.
 Registration for a bid number, which began Sunday, is required and can be done by going online to https://vareliefsale.com/.
 This tasteful note — several popular food items will be available on a pickup basis, including barbecued chicken, Mississippi catfish dinners and homemade potato chips. Baked goods will be on sale at the fairgrounds at specified times.
 This well-orchestrated event simply can’t happen without the yeoman and woman efforts of a battery of volunteers. Many are already hard at work behind the scenes, but according to relief sale chair Dave Rush, more help is needed, especially with preparing, packaging and delivering the takeout meals on Friday night and Saturday ... and, of course, with cleanup.
 “Even though the thousands of people who usually come from all over to attend this event aren’t able to get together this year, I still believe they will give generously to aid others around the world,” Dave said.
 So, you live out of town or are otherwise unable to participate in this gala affair? No problem -- donations are gladly accepted online at vareliefsale.com or by mailing a check to Virginia Mennonite Relief Sale, 601 Parkwood Drive, Harrisonburg VA 22802.
 MCC, as it celebrates its 100th anniversary, will appreciate your lavish response to this worthy cause — and so will Dan Bowman.
