The Mystics (8-13) would clinch a berth with a victory over Atlanta in a regular-season finale on Sunday. A loss would open the door for Dallas (7-14), which would then advance with a victory over the last-place Liberty (2-19) Sunday as the Wings own the tiebreaker over the Mystics.

With their complex and hi-tech hollow construction, Relish’s Swiss-made guitars take a very fresh look at the electric instrument. They’re also made in small numbers and cost a pretty penny. Until now. In comparison with the Swiss-made instruments, Trinity by Relish is made in Indonesia and is a simplified, more conventional instrument that retains the pull-out/push-in pickup swapping system that we first encountered on the Eucalypt Mary back in issue 448 and that is now a part of all…

Amol Roy, Founder of TheShutterCast has been reading a lot of biographies of people like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, Bill Gates etc. He told ET Panache, I have always been fascinated by these people and getting to know about them in such a personal and close manner is exciting. It is fascinating to learn about the personal lives of so many successful people. There is a-lot to learn even from their failures. Roy started devoting at least an hour daily to reading. I try to keep up with the schedule at least five days a week. Reading diverts my mind from all the work pressure and stress in life. It is like switching off the brain for a while and just being with yourself, he said. Roy reads a lot of ebooks but he definitely prefer physical books. The feel of the pages, smell of a new book and just overall experience can never be compared to an ebook, he said. Travel is like an addiction, once you get a hang of it, you cannot come back. Roy misses the excitement of exploring new places, meeting a lot of new people, making friends from different parts of the world, and learning about different cultures. Last year I spent my Christmas in Bangkok with a fellow traveller from the Netherlands. It was fun learning her culture and how Christmas is celebrated. I want to visit Singapore as soon as this pandemic gets over. I actually had a plan to visit Singapore this January but it was postponed, he said. In life Roy has applied this to explore a-lot of things. We never know what we might end up liking. It has helped me learn things, explore into new domains in business, he ended. 76849173

San Francisco's Death Valley High recently unleashed Raise Hell, the first of a planned series of singles to drop throughout 2020. Describing their music as “aggressive, skronk-disco light fantastic, like Saturday Night Fever on Thorazine,” singer/guitarist Reyka Osburn isn’t really doing justice to the fact that, basically, DVH are a great rock ’n’ roll band. Why focus on releasing singles? “Instead of going into a studio and doing 10 songs, we’re going to be recording two…

Nevada has become a particular focus, in part because Las Vegas is an appetizing location for Trump to raise money. He scheduled at least one high- dollar fundraiser there over the weekend -- as well as one in Washington before he flies west -- as he looks to assuage growing concerns that he could fall short of cash. Couples were asked for $150,000 for the Las Vegas fundraiser. The Republican National Committee said the $18 million expected to be raised over the weekend would be shared by Trump's campaign, the committee and several state GOP committees.

BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — Myisha Hines-Allen had 25 points and 11 rebounds to help Washington beat the New York Liberty 75-58 on Saturday, keeping the Mystics' playoff hopes alive. Washington's victory eliminates Atlanta and leaves just the Mystics and the Dallas Wings in the running for the eighth and final playoff spot. The Mystics (8-13) would clinch a berth with a victory over Atlanta in a regular-season finale on Sunday. A loss would open the door for Dallas (7-14), which would then advance with a victory over the last-place Liberty (2-19) Sunday as the Wings own the tiebreaker over the Mystics. Hines-Allen was 8-of-16 shooting, making all three of her 3-point attempts and all six free throws. Ariel Atkins added 18 points and five steals with Leilani Mitchell scoring 12 points. The Mystics scored the first nine points, led 36-29 at halftime and were up by as many 20 in the third quarter Kia Nurse and Kiah Stokes, the latter with five 3-pointers, scored 15 points each for the Liberty.

The veteran Justin Allgaier gave a master class in perseverance and fast cars Friday night winning the Go Bowling 250 NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Richmond (Va.) Raceway. It was the 34-year old Allgaier’s first career win in 19 tries at the three-quarter mile track and he finished .604-seconds ahead of a hard-charging 21-year old Justin Haley. The Xfinity Series all-time winningest driver, reigning NASCAR Cup Series champion Kyle Busch finished third, 2.5-seconds behind Allgaier. The current Xfinity Series championship leader Austin Cindric won a stage and finished fourth – nearly eight-seconds behind the winner. Only nine cars finished on the lead lap. Polesitter Ross Chastain was fifth. Brett Moffitt, a NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series championship contender was sixth. Allgaier’s JR Motorsports teammates Michael Annett and Noah Gragson were seventh and eighth with Kaz Grala and rookie Riley Herbst rounding out the top-10. Annett's finish has clinched him a spot in the Playoffs on points. Getting that second victory of 2020 goes a long way for Allgaier and his No. 7 JR Motorsports Chevrolet team after an early season of heartbreak and inconsistency. So often he has shown up for a race and had something derail his winning chances. He led 156 laps – more than half the race – at Bristol, Tenn. earlier this season only to crash out and finish 18th. At Texas, he led 98 laps and settled for third. Finally, results are matching his efforts. Allgaier got his first win of the year at Dover, Del. five races ago, leading a race best 120 of 200 laps. His 78 laps out front in his win Friday night at Richmond were also a race best. “I feel like we’ve had so many [wins] get away here, just haven’t been able to seal the deal and it’s been so frustrating," said Allgaier, who has 13 career Xfinity Series wins. “But I’m proud of these guys and proud of the effort. The pit stops were amazing. Everybody at JR Motorsports, they built a fantastic Camaro." “I’ve got to thank the man upstairs," Allgaier continued, noting, “Tonight was definitely a push to the end but we just had the luck we needed. I say luck, but luck is opportunities meeting preparation. We were prepared and the opportunities came tonight." Although disappointed not to win, Haley was encouraged after the race hoping he may have proven himself a short track ace to those fans who consider him a speedway master only. He led 51 laps and his charge to the front was impressive by any standard. His No. 11 Kaulig Racing Chevrolet fell back to 25th place after making not one, but two pit stops during the Stage 1 caution period. In 40 laps however, he’d rallied all the way up to fifth place. He took the lead on lap 174 and was finally passed by Allgaier with 28 laps remaining. “Allgaier was just a little bit better," Haley said, adding with a smile, “I’m about tired of everyone on social media saying I can’t show up anywhere but superspeedways. So I finally showed up somewhere where talent matters." Cindric earned his series best 10th stage victory in Stage 1 with Allgaier leading the way in Stage 2 in what was a largely “clean” race – only five caution flags (three mandated my NASCAR for a competition caution and the two stage breaks) and no major incidents. The Xfinity Series Playoffs begin in two weeks and the 12th and final transfer position remains up for grabs between a pair of privateer family-owned teams and drivers Brandon Brown and Jeremy Clements. Brown came into the race with a 45-point advantage and the two ran near each other much of the night. Ultimately, Clements finished 17th and Brown was on his heels in 18th. Brown now holds a 43-point advantage as they reset for Saturday’s second Richmond race. The Team Penske driver Cindric takes a 67-point championship advantage over Chase Briscoe, who finished 11th at Richmond. The series completes its Richmond Raceway doubleheader with the Virginia is for Racing Lovers 250 on Saturday (2 p.m. ET on NBCSN, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Only two races remain to settle the Playoff field.
