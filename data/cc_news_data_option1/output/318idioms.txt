Seton Catholic girls basketball coach Karen Self has been named the Girls West Coach for the 2020 McDonald’s All-American Game.
 Self was announced as the head coach Thursday afternoon.
 “This is pretty much the coolest thing that has ever happened to me,” Self said. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.”
 Self has led the Seton Catholic girls basketball program since 1992. Under her direction, the Sentinels have captured 10 state titles and have been runner-up five times. She’s also led Seton Catholic to 25 region championships.
 This year, the Sentinels are seeking their seventh straight state-championship appearance. They’re currently 15-4 on the year and the top-ranked team according to the Arizona Interscholastic Association’s rankings.
 In her 28 years leading Seton Catholic, Self has an overall record of 723-147.
 “I can’t think of anyone else who is more deserving,” Seton Catholic Principal Victor Serna said in a press release. “Coach Self’s accolades speak for themselves, but the level of humility and passion she displays is what makes her one of the great ones.”
 Self said she received a phone call from a McDonald’s committee member in early January telling her she had been chosen to coach the All-Star game.
 The news came as a shock to Self, to say the least.
 “I had no idea,” Self said. “I didn’t know I was under consideration or anything. I guess my name was just thrown into a hat and that’s it. It was the most unbelievable thing.”
 Self’s trip to Houston in April won’t be her first time experiencing the McDonald’s All-American Game, but it will be her first as a coach.
 She attended the games in 2005 with Seton Catholic alum Christina Wirth, who was selected to play during her time in high school. Wirth went on to become an All-American at Vanderbilt University before she was selected in the second round of the WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever in 2009.
 Self was made aware of who she would be coaching during the 2020 McDonald’s All-American Game, as the player rosters were also announced Thursday.
 Self will be in charge of 12 of the top female players in the western United States. Nearly every girl on the West roster is committed to powerhouse Division I programs, including Oregon, Connecticut and Baylor.
 Players were selected by a committee of basketball experts. More than 900 players from across the country were nominated to play in the game. Only 24 girls and 24 boys were selected.
 Self said she will fly to Houston on March 28 but isn’t aware of what her schedule will entail in the remaining days leading up to the game. She does expect to take part in charity work at the local Ronald McDonald House in Houston, something she became familiar with in Phoenix this year as her team served dinner and helped set up for the McDonald House’s gala in November.
 “Our team chooses a charity every year and it just so happens we chose the Ronald McDonald House this year,” Self said. “We’ve been bringing food to the families that are staying there. It feels like it will be a good culmination of the year because I know we will do something in Houston when we go.”
 The McDonald’s All-American Game will take place on Wednesday, April 1 at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. Games will be broadcasted live on ESPN2 and ESPN.

 He and his team have crafted a cocktail menu that will change with the seasons, using all-vegan ingredients and an in-house lab with a dehydrator and sous vide equipment.
 The menu is split into stirred, sour and sparkling cocktails, plus three classic drinks - a bellini, a gin highball and a cognac daisy - given a new flavour twist every week, starting with maple-toasted pecan and pear.

This "potato thing" sizzled into my life when my 6-year-old son decided to cook a potato.      He grated a spud, heated oil in a pan and added the tangle of potato shreds, and had the sense to leave the pan on low heat before getting distracted, which might be the only reason he managed to cook Potato Thing. The human urge to mess with things unnecessarily may have no greater stage than the kitchen. Potato Thing prefers to be left alone. Until it's time to flip.      I was in the kitchen at just the right time to flip this sizzling disk that smelled of gold. Gazing at the browned side now facing up, I saw the bright, greasy matrix of crunchy potato fibers that I had been smelling. We gathered 'round the pan, attracted by the smell. When the other side was done, we feasted on the tater tot-like magnificence of a crispy exterior and its pillowy center.      Since then, I've been seeing Potato Thing everywhere. Even the gas station the other morning, when my hunting buddy got back into the car with a so-called "Potato Triangle" that looked familiar, or the local greasy spoon, which serves this side called "hash browns."      The kids kept asking me to make it again, and I tried, but couldn't recreate the magic of that original thing.      At the farmers market, where so much important information is shared, Big Nancy set me straight on Potato Thing, or "fries," as she calls them.      "You need a really hot pan," the potato grower said, nodding understandingly when I told her about my troubles.   "You know how to make Potato Thing?" I asked, eagerly.      "It's pretty much the only way I eat spuds."      For the next three weeks, I made Potato Thing. On weekends I'd visit Big Nancy at the market, buy potatoes and talk Potato Thing.      She recommends waxy potatoes like Huckleberry Gold, a purple skinned yellow- fleshed variety she sells, or its more common cousin the Yukon Gold. A lot of water gets released during the course of a batch, and Big Nancy covers her skillet with a tight fitting lid, which concentrates the steam and cooks the potatoes at a temperature that's hotter than boiling water. Her cast iron lid collects water, which she occasionally pours off.      When I make it, I squeeze out the water before frying. And that's not the only way my Potato Thing differs from hers. But we are perfectly aligned in the most important part, where you just stand there and don't do anything. No stirring. One flip. And it's done.      Potato Thing   The quantities listed are for a single Potato Thing that will fill a six-inch pan. You can grate and mix larger batches, and even use a larger pan, but keep the individual Potato Things small and manageable. Some cheese, egg or other goodies will add depth and contrast, not to mention protein, to Potato Thing.      For 1 six-inch Potato Thing   • 1 pound peeled potato   • 1 tablespoon high temperature fry oil (safflower and peanut are my favorites)   • ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper   • Optional toppings: cheese, chile flakes, jalapeno slices, egg      Grate the potato and save the small, French fry-sized piece that remains in your fingertips after you don't dare grate any further. Squeeze out the water from the grated potato in a colander, as if making a snowball, and then transfer the potato to a bowl. Add the salt and pepper (and chile flakes, if you wish) and mix.      Pat the ball into a hockey puck-sized disk that fits on a spatula.      Heat the oil on medium/high. As it heats, add the potato end you didn't grate, and adjust the heat to a temperature where the fry cooks gently, bubbling contentedly but not menacingly. That's your cue that the oil is ready.      Remove the small fry and add the puck of shredded potato.      Use a spatula, fork or even your fingers to shape the thing into a circle that's about a half-inch deep. Press gently on the thicker parts, first in the center and then the edges, while pulling in the rim to keep it sharp. By this time it should be sliding in the pan like an air hockey puck. Put the lid on and hover nearby on alert. The minute you start to smell a hint of overbrowning, flip it.   If you look at the bottom and conclude you flipped it too early, you can re- flip it again later. For now, let the new side cook, lid on.      If it looks like it needs oil, add just a little, or some butter. When you smell brown, turn it down, and let it slowly cook home. Turning down the heat at the end allows time to add toppings like cheese, a fried egg or both.      Put the lid back on to melt the cheese. Serve hot.      If it cools down, don't despair. Re-fried in oil, Potato Thing reheats as well as any leftover, but more golden.

To be sure, technology enables consumers to do more at home, and dental care ― with its limited insurance coverage ― offers a large potential market. Home teeth-whitening kits have largely displaced in-office treatments, for example.
 Now, teeth straightening is the newest dental frontier, with startups like SmileDirectClub, Candid, Smilelove and SnapCorrect advertising their services aggressively on billboards and social media.
 When results are good, the DIY approach can yield thousands of dollars in savings. But when the treatment plan doesn’t produce results or goes wrong, consumer-patients like Rosemond voice their frustrations in Facebook groups and complain to the Better Business Bureau or the Federal Trade Commission that they have nowhere to turn for help.
 The companies do not make information public about success rates or problems — although SmileDirectClub says it has achieved a rating of 4.9 stars out of 5 on nearly 58,000 Google reviews — and there are few scientific studies of outcomes for direct-to-consumer orthodontics.
 To get a simple refund after an initial 30-day period, patients are often asked to sign what SmileDirectClub calls a “release,” stating the consumer won’t complain publicly — which it says is fairly standard in business. A shareholder lawsuit against the firm says those releases suppress consumer complaints, leaving investors in the dark.

“Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening complication related to an infection.” Ramar says every year, close to three-quarters of a million people in the U.S. develop a septic reaction. It happens when an infection prompts the immune system to kick into overdrive, causing problems such as kidney failure, liver failure, severe drops in blood pressure and even death. “It becomes very important that this is recognized early.” That’s because the death rate can be very high. Up to 75% for people who develop sepsis at home and up to 25% for those who get it in the hospital.
 “It’s similar to treating a heart attack or a stroke, where you have a very short window within which you take the necessary steps to prevent significant damage from happening down the road. It’s a big multidisciplinary approach to do this, and so all members of the ICU team are actively involved to get this aggressive resuscitation going and to get all the things done. We follow what we call the Surviving Sepsis Resuscitation Guidelines.” Methods of best practice developed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine to ensure the best possible treatment for patients. “If the necessary things are done, then the mortality drops down dramatically.” By following the best practice guidelines, Ramar says the sepsis response team has made Mayo Clinic’s Medical ICU a leader in successful sepsis treatment.
 Who’s at risk for developing sepsis? Ramar says it can happen to anybody, but people whose immune systems are compromised and those with diseases such as diabetes are at increased risk. He also says, signs of infection you should take seriously include persistent fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, confusion and worsening condition. If you experience these things, see your health care provider or seek emergency medical care.
