A proud and entitled 90% of Los Angeles’ sports fans against the shadowed 10% who would love to shut them up?
 It’s going to be Alex Caruso furious, Patrick Beverley wild, Anthony Davis cool and Kawhi Leonard tough.
 When it happens, it will not only be historic, but would also make history, because the winner would advance to the NBA Finals and probably be heavy favorites once they arrive. This won’t just be for the West title, it’s likely going to be for the NBA title, the league crown essentially captured in a fight between two teams who share a downtown Los Angeles tunnel. Are you kidding me?

Law360 (September 10, 2020, 9:48 PM EDT) -- A controversial proposal to add a liquefied natural gas export facility at a southern New Jersey port stalled Thursday when the Delaware River Basin Commission voted to delay its final approval of the project amid pushback from an environmental group overseeing the river.      The decision to delay the proposed Gibbstown Liquefied Natural Gas Export Terminal came in light of the Delaware Riverkeeper Network's pending administrative appeal of the commission's prior approval of the project, according to commission Communication Specialist Kate Schmidt.

Every year, NFL coaches deal with a level of uncertainty when the regular season begins. Even when you have preseason games, teams always add new wrinkles when the games begin in Week 1. Although there's some preparation, teams quickly find themselves adjusting on the fly in that regular-season opener.
 This year, all bets are truly off.
 That couldn't be more evident when the Patriots take on the Miami Dolphins this Sunday. The Pats are trotting out a new quarterback and offense behind Cam Newton. On top of that, their defense lost four starters from last season. Dolphins coach Brian Flores can only take an educated guess on what offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels will actually do.
 Without any preseason games, no one knows how the Patriots will look until that 1 p.m. kickoff.
 "We've watched a lot of film on (Newton)," Flores told the New England media on Wednesday. "But at the end of the day it comes back to when you haven't seen a team play a game or a preseason, we continually talk about quarterback, but what are we going to see from an o-line standpoint? What are we going to see at the receiver position? What are we going to see in the kicking game? What are we going to see defensively? There's a lot of unknowns."
 The same goes for Bill Belichick as he prepares for a new-look Miami team this weekend. The Dolphins are starting veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, but the Patriots are still preparing for rookie quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in the event he enters the game. But how exactly do the Patriots know what to expect from the rookie when they haven't seen him take a single snap in the preseason?
 They don't.
 That remains true for all 32 NFL teams this week. Coaches are preparing their teams to play against players who haven't taken a single snap and for other players who are new to their teams. The Dolphins, for example, loaded up on defense this offseason signing Pro Bowl cornerback Byron Jones, defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah and linebackers Kyle Van Noy, Shaq Lawson, Kamu Grugier-Hill and Elandon Roberts.
 As much as Flores and the Dolphins need to prepare for the unknown with Newton and the Patriots' offense, the same goes for Pats offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
 "I think each team on opening day, when we did have a preseason, there was still a lot of anxiety and still a lot of unknowns, what you were dealing with relative to what you may or may not see, where players may or may not line up, who may or may not be playing across from you," McDaniels said. "I think both teams, especially this year across the league, both teams are going to have the same opportunities to unveil some thing that we haven't seen from the other team."
 This weekend, the Patriots and Dolphins will unveil new looks on both sides of the ball. For the Patriots' defense, we don't know what the unit will look like without Van Noy, Jamie Collins, Dont'a Hightower and Patrick Chung. The team will likely lean heavily on rookies like safety Kyle Dugger and linebackers Josh Uche and Anfernee Jennings -- players with zero NFL film since the preseason was canceled due to COVID-19.
 The Dolphins' offense is also starting the season with a new offensive coordinator in Chan Gailey, who hasn't coached since 2016. How will Miami look with a new offensive play caller?
 "I mean it's opening day; there are always a lot of variables on opening day, and there are even more this year for a number of reasons and that would be another one," Belichick said. "Chan has had lot of success in this league of running his style offense, but he may modify that some and do something that would take advantage of Miami's personnel. ... So we're just going to have to wait and see on that."
 That couldn't be truer for the Patriots' offense. Flores has been studying tape on Newton from the QB's days in Carolina. He said the Dolphins will be focused on keeping him in the pocket and head into this prepared to deal with a mobile quarterback. Flores' plan is to have his players lean on what they learned in training camp and focus on their fundamentals.
 "Yes, there's a lot of unknown," Flores said. "I think just form a personnel standpoint, based on college and based on previous years, you try to know the skill set or try to forecast what they're going to do with specific guys, but you really don't know."

 Yodny Cajuste's NFL career is off to a tough start.
 According to a source, the Patriots are placing the 2019 third-round pick on the injured reserve. Cajuste missed all of last season with a lower-body injury and now will have to wait to make his NFL debut.
 Cajuste was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but missed time this summer in training camp and now will be on the injured reserve for at least three weeks. According to a source, the tackle's injury isn't considered season ending and he's expected to return at some point this year.
 It appears that the Patriots are starting Jermaine Eluemunor at right tackle. The team's primary backups are Korey Cunningham and rookie Justin Herron.
 ESPN was the first to report the news on Cajuste.

Thanks to the upcoming election, readers have asked if we would publish their column-length opinion pieces. We’re always looking for new local columnists who can consistently contribute to the opinion page, so here are a few guidelines if you would like to try.
 We ask that pieces be in the range of 500 to 550 words, preferably at the lower end.
 We want our opinion pages to be more than all Trump all the time. We need readers’ opinions about state and local issues, too.
 We ask that local columns focus mainly on local topics and local issues. They may be based on national or international matters, but in that case they need to have a strong local angle. We’ve asked our regular contributors to do this, too. If a local person wants to write on a national topic, he or she should have a strong personal connection to whatever is being discussed or some background that provides authority and knowledge.
 One important consideration is that columns must be more than lists of generalities. We need details. Expertise. Persuasiveness.
 Thursday’s newspaper carried a piece written by local columnist Diane Mufson about her concern a new COVID-19 vaccine would be released for trials prematurely. She used her near-miss with the drug Thalidomide to make her point. It was a national issue with a local and personal concern.
 Tell us why your party will do better for West Virginia or the Tri-State. Give us a reason to be for something, not against someone.
 The bottom line: Focus on the reader, not on your own anger. Tell a story. Stick to your main point; don’t wander all over the place. Be unique. Tell us something the rest of us don’t know.
 We would rather run a 500-word piece from a local business person about their experience with COVID-19 shutdowns than another national piece criticizing a national politician. We want to hear from teachers, parents and others about the ever-changing situation in education right now.

Amid routine testing, Hamilton College in Clinton and SUNY Polytechnic Institute in Marcy haven't found any COVID-19 cases among students or staff.
   
 Other local colleges have only seen, at most, a few cases despite large outbreaks at other campuses that have made national headlines and shut some campuses down. An outbreak at SUNY Oneonta has grown to 696 cases, according to state data; the campus has shut down for the semester in favor of remote learning.
   
 Throughout this, local college leaders remain confident they can keep their students and staff safe, and their campuses open, through vigilance and science.
   
 Utica College will rely on "testing, constant messaging, constructive and cooperative community stewardship by every member of the campus," said Shad Crowe, director of emergency management.
   
 He acknowledged that the success of the effort will require cooperation from everyone.
   
 "Students, faculty, staff -- everyone has to remain hyper-vigilant when it comes to health and safety right now," he said in an email. "The Utica College family recognizes how important to the entire Oneida County area health and safety is on our campus because it can have a direct impact on our neighbors. Our students understand we are all depending on them, as the largest part of our team, to continue to make this happen.
   
 "And, for the most part, the students are proving how much they value being on campus and in the classroom."
   
 In total, 1,110 cases have been reported across the entire State University of New York system as of Wednesday, according to a new system-wide COVID-19 dashboard SUNY has launched. Across the state, 582 SUNY students who have tested positive remain in isolation, 215 of them on SUNY campuses.
   
 Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that any college in New York that has more than 100 positive coronavirus cases must report to the state Department of Health immediately.
   
 The edict follows Cuomo's announcement Aug. 29 that a college needs to go to online learning for 14 days if more than 100 positive cases are reported or if an outbreak is equal to more than 5% of the campus population.
   
 One hundred "cases can happen very easily," Cuomo said Tuesday.
   
 "You saw all the other colleges that have it. That Department of Health regulation is going to go out today. It is going to be unequivocal. And as soon as the college has notice from any source, they have to immediately report it."

 When Herkimer County Community College students arrived to move into the dorms, they and the people accompanying them were all tested for COVID-19. One student and that student's sibling tested positive, so they were sent away before entering the dorm, a campus spokeswoman said.
   
 At Mohawk Valley Community College, 164 students were tested before being allowed to move into the residence halls, according to a campus statement. None tested positive, but a commuter student, who was tested by the student's employer, tested positive and reported the test results to the college, the statement said.
   
 At Utica College, 6,644 tests have turned up four students and one employee with COVID-19 since July 27, according to the college's data dashboard. Only one student remains an active case.
   
 Before classes began, all staff and students underwent rapid-result nasal swab tests at the college's Dome while still in their vehicles and before being given their room keys and IDs. This testing identified two students and one employee with COVID-19, according to a spokeswoman.
   
 Now the college is using pool testing, in which samples from a group of individuals is combined and tested. If the sample turns up positive, then the remainder of the sample from each individual would be tested.
   
 Despite the low number of cases, Utica College has had some experience with the kinds of situation that have led to outbreaks on other campuses. Right after students moved back into the dorms Aug. 21, campus safety officers found a group of a dozen students gathered in a dorm without masks or social distancing. The students were kicked out of the dorms and will study online this semester, officials said.
   
 Since then, two more groups of students, for a total of 15 students, have been told to leave campus and study online for the rest of the semester because of unsafe off-campus activity, a spokeswoman said.
   
 At Colgate University in Hamilton, students emerged from a mandatory two-week quarantine on Tuesday morning. To date, 37 students and four employees have tested positive for COVID-19, but only 14 students still remain in isolation, according to the campus data dashboard. With 2,683 students on campus and 1,188 employees, that's an infection rate of 0.4%, according to the dashboard.
   
 All students got COVID-19 tests before coming to Hamilton, within 24 hours of their arrival, eight days into quarantine and again when quarantine ended. So almost 10,000 tests have been done on campus, a spokesman said.
   
 Going forward, about 6% of students and employees will be tested weekly and the college is having its wastewater tested for the virus, a spokesman said.
   
 Hamilton College and SUNY Poly are also staying vigilant and working to prevent cases. SUNY Poly is using pool testing, too.
   
 "We feel confident in the plans we have put in place to enable in-person learning in a safe way," Hamilton President David Wippman said in a statement. "Among other things, we are testing all students and student-facing faculty and staff twice each week, in order to maximize the probability that we can catch and contain any positive cases before they spread widely. With this pandemic, however, there can be no guarantees."
   
 SUNY statewide
   
 The SUNY tracker Wednesday showed campuses administered more than 36,000 tests and 474 came back positive, an infection rate of about 1.3% -- which is slightly higher than the less than 1% the state has been under for the past month.
   
 The total number of cases -- 1,110 -- includes cases from testing that was not administered by the colleges.
   
 So far. only SUNY Oneonta has topped 100 cases. SUNY Fredonia had 81 and the University at Buffalo had 63 as of Wednesday.
   
 Testing has varied widely at SUNY schools, though, with some campuses administering thousands of tests and others just a handful.
   
 Across the system of more than 415,000 students, there are currently 586 asymptomatic students in mandatory quarantine and 202 in precautionary quarantine because of exposure or potential exposure to COVID-19.
   
 The tracker also showed that SUNY had 3,722 rooms on campus to house students who may be infected, and 473 were being used.
   
 "As coronavirus cases spring up on our college campuses, we are reviewing real-time case data around the clock," SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras said in a statement.
   
 "This data is crucial to helping SUNY make quick, smart decisions that contain COVID-19 and protect our campus communities."

The Patriots came into this summer loaded at cornerback. The defense returns every player from last season and is led by reigning Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore. On paper, it doesn't really get any better.
 However, that didn't stop Bill Belichick from trying to bring back five-time Pro Bowl cornerback Aqib Talib.
 On Wednesday, Talib, who played with the Patriots from 2012-13, announced his retirement and revealed that Belichick personally called him and tried to get him to come play in Foxboro this season. The 34-year-old wanted to play one more season and nearly came to New England. However, when he had second thoughts, he decided to hang up his cleats.
 "My guy, my big homie Bill Belichick called my phone... told me he had the role of a lifetime for me," Talib said while announcing his new podcast 'All to the Booth'. "He really wanted me to strap right ends. I was out the door. I got flights. I started searching apartments... I could've gotten up to $5-6 million -- a nice vet contract. I could make $6 million and guard tight ends all day. I'm like, 'I'm cool.'
 Then I start going through their schedule. I see (George) Kittle, (Travis) Kelce, (Darren) Waller. Usually when I get in this position, I'm going to a new team, my thoughts are all positive. Like, 'OK, this guy is here, if he does this, maybe I can do this. Maybe I can get this many interceptions and go to the Pro Bowl. These guys in the NFC so I have to beat out him and him.' You know, I kind of run down all positive thoughts. This time, I look at this (expletive) schedule and the thought -- I said, 'Can I even strap these tight ends?' I said, 'ah (expletive). It's over with.' Once I aid that, once that negative thought crossed my mind, I said my heart, my competitive edge, like, I'm not really in it any more."
 The Patriots schedule indeed is loaded with talented tight ends. They'll face three of last year's four Pro Bowlers in Kelce, Kittles and Mark Andrews. The players Talib mentioned (Kittle, Kelce and Waller) were the only tight ends in the NFL to finish with over 1,000 receiving yards in 2019.
 Captains in Miami  
 When the Miami Dolphins announced their team captains on Monday, there was a noticeable theme. Out of the eight players nominated, three of them were on the Patriots last year -- linebacker Kyle Van Noy, linebacker Elandon Roberts and center Ted Karras.
 The Patriots theme isn't a surprise in Miami considering their coach Brian Flores came from New England.
 "It says a lot about those three," Flores said Wednesday. "We also have five other guys who were named captain. We had a handful of other guys who also had some votes for captain. I don't want to put too much on those three guys. They were three of let's call it 10 or 11 guys who got votes. They've come in, they've worked hard. They've competed. Obviously, there's been some familiarity with the system defensively, but Ted came in and learned a new system offensively pretty quickly."
 On defense, this year's Dolphins team could start up to four players with Patriots ties -- Van Noy, Roberts, Kamu Grugier-Hill and Eric Rowe. Backup cornerback Jamal Perry and linebacker Calvin Munson were also previously on the Patriots' practice squad.
 It certainly wasn't a shock for current Patriots players to see Roberts (a captain for the Patriots last year), Van Noy (a veteran leader for the Patriots) or Karras (who started last year) to take on immediate leadership roles for Miami.
 "All good players," Patriots cornerback Jonathan Jones said. "They all have what Coach Flores is looking for in players and can kind of set the tone for him as players in the locker room. It doesn't come as much of a surprise they're all great guys and great football players."

Yodny Cajuste's NFL career is off to a tough start.
 According to a source, the Patriots are placing the 2019 third-round pick on the injured reserve. Cajuste missed all of last season with a lower-body injury and now will have to wait to make his NFL debut.
 Cajuste was expected to compete for the starting right tackle position, but missed time this summer in training camp and now will be on the injured reserve for at least three weeks. According to a source, the tackle's injury isn't considered season ending and he's expected to return at some point this year.
 It appears that the Patriots are starting Jermaine Eluemunor at right tackle. The team's primary backups are Korey Cunningham and rookie Justin Herron.
 ESPN was the first to report the news on Cajuste.
