NATICK - Sunday marks the moment 168 years ago when Frederick Douglass surprised a gathering in Rochester, New York, and delivered the speech, "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?"
 It wasn't a surprise that Douglass was there.
 The noted abolitionist, who escaped slavery in Maryland, was invited by the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society to give a speech to honor the 76th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the document that says, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal…."
 But what the audience heard on that day in 1852 was unexpected.
 "Way off script," and "an indictment of white America and American democracy" was what they got, said Brenna Greer, an associate professor of history at Wellesley College.
 Greer and 15 Natick teenagers each read portions of a shortened version of Douglass' Fourth of July speech on Thursday evening on the front steps of the Morse Institute Library.
 Unlike Rochester of the 19th century, social distancing and wearing face masks were observed at Thursday's reading. But what hasn't changed, according to students who participated in the reading sponsored by the Natick Historical Society, is the continued fight by people of color for freedom and opportunity, clearly expressed in Douglass' speech.
 Laila Christian, 18, was the first student to read on the library steps.
 "Black Lives Matter is important. It's my reality every day," she said.
 This fall, Christian is headed to Spelman College in Atlanta. Her goal is to become a doctor in order to close health care disparities that exist in the Black community.
 Christian would like to see more selective hiring in police departments, and history courses in high school that are "telling real history" about the Black experience in America.
 "Black people are more than slaves," Christian said, noting she will not celebrate the Fourth of July as a protest.
 Christian's mother, Latoya LaGuerre, and sister Lauren, who attends Lilja Elementary School, were in attendance.
 "It's important," LaGuerre said. "It gives a different side of what the Fourth means to some of us. My hope is my daughters will walk freely, and not be in danger because of the color of their skin."
 Jeilin Houston, 17, an incoming senior at Natick High School, came to support her friend and classmate, 17-year-old Alexa Solomon, who read from the library steps.
 "The speech is relevant today," Houston said. "It shows how stuck America is."
 "Frederick Douglass had a way with words to reach so many people," Solomon said.      She said what she learned from her passage was Douglass felt it was his duty to share the experience of being Black in America.
 Douglass visited Natick in the spring of 1842, Greer said, noting slavery was alive and well when Douglass delivered his speech.
 Greer mentioned an historical milestone to prove her point - the 1850 congressional passage of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required slaves be returned to their owners, even if they were in a free state.
 Presently, Blacks experience higher rates of unemployment and account for more than 25% of deaths from COVID-19, despite representing just 13% of the U.S. population, according to Greer.
 "How well this speech has aged," she said.
 Marley Wiest, 11, may have been the youngest student to read a passage.
 "Some people say 'all lives matter,' but they should not say that. What is important is Black lives matter," Wiest said.
 Niki Lefebvre, director of the Natick Historical Society, said she would like to make a student reading of Douglass' speech an annual Fourth of July event.
 Lefebvre delivered a final message to the 15 teenagers: "It takes courage to read such powerful rhetoric. This will be the beginning of a conversation."
