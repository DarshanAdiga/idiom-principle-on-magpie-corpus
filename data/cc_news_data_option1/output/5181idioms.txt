ALBANY, Ga. (WALB) - Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany believes it will start vaccinating employees for the COVID-19 virus on Thursday.Phoebe’s facilities in Worth and Sumter counties are on the list to get the vaccine as well.Phoebe Putney Health System CEO Scott Steiner said all of their facilities, including those in Worth and Sumter counties, can distribute the highly anticipated Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine once it arrives.Scott Steiner“We’re ready to go right now,” said Steiner. “We’ve been given no guarantees with what we’ve ordered is arriving but we have reason to believe we’re going to get that 1,000 for Worth and 5,000 for Dougherty County and then just a day or two behind that, we believe we’ll get the same 2,000 thousand for Sumter.”Steiner said their facilities in Albany, Worth and Sumter counties have the freezers needed to store the Pfizer vaccine that’s on the way now.“And we’re ready to take vaccines at all facilities,” Steiner told WALB News 10.He said all facilities are prepared with the right equipment and have practiced drills and protocols for when the vaccine is in their hands.“But we’re gonna be requesting as much of the vaccine as we can,” said Steiner.He said the first Pfizer order of vaccines will be given to their healthcare frontline workers and EMS.“We can reorder. So as soon as we get these, we’ll put in orders for more,” explained Steiner.Steiner believes about 50 to 80 percent of Phobe employees will take the vaccine.“I had, I don’t know, six, seven, eight people say when are we getting them. I’m so excited about taking them. I wanna be first,” said Steiner.Steiner said there are currently no COVID-19 patients at Phoebe Worth.He said the critical access hospital can’t accept really sick people, like COVID-19 patients, but said they would be sent to Phoebe in Albany for care.There are currently 70 COVID-19 positive patients within Phoebe’s Albany facilities and 11 at Phoebe Sumter.“We’re excited and we’re gonna make history,” said Steiner.Pheobe said it is still unsure of when its first order of vaccines will arrive, but hospital officials are hopeful it will be Thursday.Copyright 2020 WALB.

Canadian cannabis company Aurora Cannabis Inc. said Wednesday it has reached an agreement with its lenders to extend the maturity of its credit facility to December 31, 2022. The company also said it has ceased operations at the Aurora Sun facility and scaled back production at the Aurora Sky facility to 25 percent of its previous capacity.
 Aurora Cannabis' announcement comes as its rivals Aphria Inc. and Tilray, Inc. said they have agreed to combine their businesses and create the world's largest cannabis company based on pro forma revenue.
 Aurora Cannabis noted that the amended credit facility agreement will transition the facility to a minimum liquidity covenant from a minimum EBITDA covenant, and provide it with the financial flexibility required to execute its business transformation plan.
 There are no changes to the commitment amounts under the facility which currently stand at $101.2 million under the term loan and $15 million under the revolver.
 Further, Aurora Cannabis said it is moving to a more variable cost structure in cultivation by expanding its network of external supply and scaling back production from its fixed asset network.      ---      "Specifically, in November we closed our Aurora Sun facility and are now scaling back production at Aurora Sky to 25% of its previous capacity. At this level of production, we intend to transform the Sky facility into a high-value cultivation center for our premium strains, and in turn, better align production with current demand for premium flower," said Miguel Martin, Chief Executive Officer of Aurora.
 Effective December 15, 2020, Aurora Cannabis has shuttered operations at the Aurora Sun facility and reduced production at its Aurora Sky facility by 75 percent. According to the company, Aurora Sky is testing new processes and methodologies proven successful at other cultivation sites in the company's network.
 Aurora Cannabis said that its plan to address opportunities in the Canadian consumer market and a strong balance sheet will allow it to invest in the international medical cannabis business, which is exhibiting solid growth. The company also intends to build on its CBD brand Reliva, which is #1 ranked by Nielsen in U.S. CBD.
 In May, Aurora Cannabis announced its entry into the lucrative U.S. marijuana market with its acquisition of Massachusetts-based Reliva LLC, a seller of hemp-derived cannabidiol or CBD products.

SALEM, Ore. — Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has proposed a $15 million budget cut to the Port of Coos Bay's channel modification, a project that would allow the port to take its place among the international shipping giants on the West Coast.
 On Dec. 1, Gov. Brown released her proposed $25.6 billion budget for 2021-23. The next fiscal year begins July 1.
 On page 310, the proposal has one line stating the port's project will no longer be slated to receive lottery dollars.
 "It was absolutely a surprise. We had no advance warning," said Margaret Barber, director of external affairs at the port. "It's tremendously disappointing."
 The project's advocates say expanding the channel to 45 feet deep and 450 feet wide would open new avenues for international trade of agricultural goods and transform southern Oregon's economy. But without sufficient funding, port leaders say the project could stall.
 This isn't the project's first disruption.
 John Burns, the port's CEO, told the Capital Press earlier this fall the project has faced other interruptions, including when investors withdrew support during the Great Recession.
 The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but observers speculate Brown slashed the funding for two main reasons: lottery dollars are fewer this year and the project is controversial. Most other lottery funding for statewide projects was retained in the budget.
 When restaurants and other venues were closed, fewer people have played the lottery, resulting in less state revenue.
 Policy experts suggest the governor may have cut channel modification funding because it's environmentally unpopular. Earlier this year, about a dozen environmental agencies told the Capital Press the project could disrupt marine and fish habitats and reduce water quality.
 But advocates say the project has wide bipartisan support despite the controversy.
 Funding for the channel modification was approved by Oregon legislators in 2006. Dollars were meant to be dished out in installments. Now, longtime supporters say they won't let go of that funding without a fight.
 Barber of the port said her team is "ramping up" to work with the Legislature this session.
 "I'm confident we'll get at least some portion of that money back," she said.
 Sen. Arnie Roblan, D-Coos Bay, who has advocated the project 16 years, said he didn't get advance notice of the budget cut, either.
 "I had not caught this particular issue," Roblan told the Capital Press Wednesday. "I'm really glad you (the Capital Press) had your eye on the ball here and pointed this out. I think I might have missed it completely."
 Roblan said he will fight to get funding for the project in the final budget before he retires at the end of the legislative session.
 Roblan said he hopes Boomer Wright and Dick Anderson, both Republicans and soon-to-be Coos Bay's new representative and senator, respectively, will shepherd the project forward. But, Roblan said, Wright and Anderson will need to "work harder to get their voices heard" as members of the minority party.
 The budget proposal's next stop is the Legislature, which convenes Jan. 19. The lottery bonds will be put into a bill and sent through the legislative process.

SALEM — Oregon is moving forward with a final rule to phase out most uses of the pesticide chlorpyrifos by the end of 2023.
 Chlorpyrifos was approved for use on more than 50 crops statewide — including Christmas trees, hazelnuts, grass seed, alfalfa, sugar beets and cranberries — but garnered controversy after studies showed it may have harmful neurological effects, especially in children.
 The Oregon Department of Agriculture convened a 13-member workgroup in December 2019 to evaluate potential health and safety restrictions for chlorpyrifos. Members represented industry and environmental groups, farmworker advocates and public health experts.
 Legislation to ban chlorpyrifos also passed the Oregon House earlier this year, before stalling in the Senate amid the Republican walkout.
 Ultimately, ODA crafted a three-year phaseout that immediately classifies chlorpyrifos as a restricted-use pesticide. The rule, formally adopted Dec. 15, stops short of a complete ban and will continue to allow certain uses, such as cattle ear tags, pre-plant seed treatments and granular formulations aimed at controlling soil-borne pests.
 "We feel like we came up with a rule that gives some flexibility to the agricultural community, and is protective of workers, bystanders and water quality," said Rose Kachadoorian, ODA pesticides program manager. "We will work with the industries as best we can to help find alternatives."
 As of Jan. 1, 2021, chlorpyrifos may no longer be used to spray for mosquitoes, on golf courses or inside greenhouses unless they meet minimum ventilation standards.
 Aerial spraying of chlorpyrifos is prohibited on all crops, except for Christmas trees within a short window from April 1 through June 15. Farmworkers cannot re-enter fields for at least four days after the last application.
 Also beginning in 2021, only licensed applicators may use and handle chlorpyrifos. In the past, unlicensed employees could spray if they were supervised by someone who is licensed.
 Buffer zones have been increased around sensitive sites and bodies of water. For aerial applications or non-targeted air-blast sprayers, the buffer is 300 feet. For targeted air-blast sprayers, the buffer is 150 feet, and for other ground-based equipment, it is 60 feet.
 Sensitive sites include farmworker housing units, though not farm residences or non-residential agricultural buildings such as barns and livestock facilities. That is based on feedback from farm groups, Kachadoorian said.
 "There was some concern that they have control over their own properties, and that to actually put a buffer there would take away a lot of land when they could just basically leave," she said. "So we allowed that particular option."
 Farm residences are already covered by protections in the federal Application Exclusion Zone, part of the U.S. Agricultural Worker Protection Standard.
 Mixing and loading chlorpyrifos can only be done by licensed applicators or by those who successfully complete an ODA-approved training course after March 1, 2021. Farms will be required to keep and maintain records for three years after each application.
 Finally, after Dec. 31, 2023, it will become illegal to use or sell chlorpyrifos in the state except for cattle ear tags, seed treatment and granular formulations.
 "We believe that with our (protective) measures, the phaseout of December 2023 is appropriate," Kachadoorian said.
 Jenny Dresler, a lobbyist for the Oregon Farm Bureau and Oregonians for Food and Shelter, said the groups are still reviewing the final rule, though it does not appear to identify proposed alternatives or provide public funding for research.
 "These are very significant restrictions," Dresler said. "We are going to be looking for an investment so growers aren't left without any tools down the road."
 Kachadoorian said it is unlikely the state will dedicate any assistance from the general fund, especially when the legislature is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and 2020 fire season.
 However, Oregon State University did receive a $162,794 specialty crop block grant from ODA earlier this year to study alternatives to chlorpyrifos.
 "We really intend to be meeting with other industries and find out what we can do to help them be able to grow their crops effectively," Kachadoorian said.

All games from Microsoft fall under the Xbox banner and many, including MSFS, will run on both Windows and the Xbox console with a single purchase (this is called the Play Anywhere program, and is only available when purchased through the Microsoft Store, not Steam). So go ahead and buy the edition you want and you will be able to run it on Windows today, and then the Xbox later, if you have one.

Le indagini del Nucleo di Polizia Economico-Finanziaria, sviluppate con il personale della locale Dogana, hanno permesso di far luce su un meccanismo in forza del quale il gasolio agricolo solo sulla carta destinato ad un agricoltore, con un imposta minore, giungeva di fatto a terzi che, invece, non avevano alcun diritto all'imposta agevolata, come ad esempio autotrasportatori: un sorta di gioco delle tre carte, in cui il truffato ero lo Stato. Tra il 2017 e il 2019, in virtu della destinazione falsamente dichiarata, il gruppo criminale aveva venduto oltre 5.059.369 litri di gasolio che avrebbe dovuto essere assoggettato a maggiore imposta (ad esempio gasolio da autotrazione, ovvero combustibile per impianti), come se fosse semplice gasolio agricolo, sottoposto a imposta agevolata. Con grossi profitti acquisiti dalla societa' siciliana attiva nel commercio all'ingrosso di prodotti petroliferi e un risparmio di imposta corrispondente a 2.496.117 euro.
