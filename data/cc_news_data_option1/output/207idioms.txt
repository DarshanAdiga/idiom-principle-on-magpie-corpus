For many climate justice campaigners (including me) the December 2019 UK election felt like a moment of hope. The opposition Labour Party was offering climate policies that – while still not perfect – would have been an urgently needed step in the right direction. So, when Labour were defeated by the fossil-fuel friendly Conservative Party whose leader refused to even show up to a televised climate debate, it felt like a bitter blow.

In China, a further deceleration in trend GDP growth is highly likely, owing to demographic realities. When I offered my earlier assessment of BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China), at the start of this century, it was already clear that by the end of the 2010s, China would be feeling the growth- constraining effects of a peaking workforce. Accordingly, I estimated that its real (inflation-adjusted), annual GDP growth in the 2020s would be about 4.5-5.5%. To achieve growth above that range would require a significant increase in productivity. In light of China’s investments in technology and shift to more domestic consumption, productivity certainly could improve. But whether that will be enough to overcome China’s other well-known challenges remains to be seen.

Unalaska acting city manager Marjie Veeder in a news release says the LifeMed aircraft with three people on board crashed about 8 a.m. The aircraft ended up in the ocean between the end of the runway and Hog Island in Unalaska Bay. The three people on board were rescued and taken to a local clinic. There was no immediate word on injuries. Unalaska is home to Dutch Harbor, the largest fishing port by volume of seafood landed in the nation.

A lot of canoe camping equipment from the '60s hasn't stood the test of time, but Calvin Rutstrum's advice on paddling and camping gear remains timeless.  
 In his book "North American Canoe Country" -- published in 1964 -- Rutstrum advises against trying to pack too lightly.  
 "The difficulty will be to arrive at a point of compromise between too much equipment and too little," he writes.  
 When it comes to ultra light gear, Rutstrum cautions, "All too frequently, piddling novelties are passed off for 'go-light' equipment, which seriously impair practical living and create needless physical and mental stress."  
 These days, paddlers have lightened their load with Gore-Tex fabrics, titanium cookware and carbon fiber canoes and paddles. (Carbon fiber boats also will lighten your wallet.) But, as Rutstrum rightly points out, "Going light for mobility's sake is, of course, sound in principle if utility does not suffer."  
 In a previous column, I wrote about Rutstrum's take on solo canoe tripping -- comparing notes from my own experiences. This week, I'll take a look at his approach to outfitting. (My friend and mentor Bill Conrad gave me a copy of "North American Canoe Country" last March and is patiently awaiting a book report.)  
 Rutstrum's advice is spot on. We venture into the wilderness for enjoyment, to be as comfortable as possible in challenging conditions. Why sacrifice that to shed a few pounds of gear? Or select a too small a boat?  
 He advises us to opt for larger, heavier canoes when appropriate, specifically to handle "rougher seas." Case in point: One year, on a mid-October trip on the Muskingum River, I used my 17-foot Grumman -- an aluminum behemoth weighing in at 72 pounds. The following October, on the same stretch of river in Zanesville, I used my 33-pound, Old Town Pack solo canoe. Both years I encountered high winds and waves of two to three feet. There were whitecaps on the river! With the Grumman, I was able to soldier on with confidence. With the solo boat, the waves nearly swamped me four or five times. I had to pull off the river at Kirkbride Marine and wait for the wind to settle down.  
 On the other hand, there are times when a heavier boat would "cause utility to suffer," as Rutstrum puts it. I take my solo boat when bushwhacking in the headwaters -- or on my Algonquin Provincial Park trips with frequent and demanding portages.  
 Rutstrum also advises against opting for too small a tent.  
 "Tents get meager and 'doghousy,' and a week of steady rain makes camp a form of imprisonment," he writes.  
 I have to differ with him on this count. Today's backpacking tents are far superior to the pup tents of Rutstrum's day. The higher-end tents are watertight and surprisingly roomy. Granted, most people wouldn't want to be cooped up in one waiting out torrential rains hour after hour, day after day. That problem is easily solved. A nylon rain tarp suspended from tree trunks with paracord provides roomy shelter, where campers can sit back, relax and stay dry.  
 Then there are those who go to opposite extremes.  
 "The risk of suggesting practical equipment over go-light gear is that the uninitiated are apt to take this as license to being along all manner of cumbersome, heavy equipment -- even worse in its consequences than the piddling variety," Rutstrum writes.  
 This brings to mind the first time I saw my friends Joe Hughes and Curt Redding in their canoes on Lake Fork of the Mohican River. I paddled up behind them and was astonished at how little freeboard they had -- four inches at most. They're hefty guys to begin with and liked to pack heavy.  
 As I got to know Curt and Joe and started canoeing with them, I began to more fully appreciate their approach. Joe's collection of cast iron skillets sure came in handy at mealtime.  
 As Rutstrum would advise, outfit yourself appropriately for the kind of trip you want. To which I would add, let your canoeing buddies do the heavy lifting.

The Burlington-Graham Metropolitan Planning Organization hosted a public forum Tuesday night in Gibsonville seeking community feedback on a draft list of transportation improvement projects as part of the five-year update to the Metropolitan Transportation Plan.
   
 Presented to the small crowd of local representatives and BGMPO members at the Gibsonville Community Center were a list of proposed projects, and maps showing their locations. The draft project list broke down suggested projects in the order they could be completed by 2025, 2035 and 2045.
   
 The projects slated for completion by 2025 are estimated to cost more than $100.8 million. According to documentation provided at the meeting, consultants estimate that $248.5 million will be available from state, regional and divisional sources.
   
 More than 60 other projects are on the proposed list for completion by 2045 for a total estimated cost of about $546.5 million.
   
 Mike Mills, the North Carolina Department of Transportation Division Engineer, said Thursday that the 2025 list of projects presented at Tuesday night's meeting are set in stone and will be completed. The 2035 and 2045 project lists are still in the works and could see changes in the future, he said.
   
 "We are one of the fastest-growing communities in North Carolina," BGMPO Administrator Wannetta Mallette said. "Over the last 10 years, our population has increased over 10 percent, and with that comes congestion. We have to develop ways to manage that growth and congestion."
   
 Getting There 2045
   
 The draft project list is part of the federally mandated five-year update to the MTP. The BGMPO's plan, called Getting There 2045, outlines the BGMPO's transportation-related goals and addresses transportation problems and impact over at least a 20-year period.
   
 "With this MTP update, we have to find a revenue source. All of the projects that we have identified has to have a dedicated source of funding," Mallette added.
   
 The project list will later be scored, and priority projects will be presented to the state for funding.
   
 "A lot of the funding processes go through the STI prioritization process, and that's where the MPO gets involved," said Lyuba Zuyeva, lead consultant on the MTP update. "That has more importance for highway, bicycle and pedestrian transportation projects than some of the other projects, for example, road resurfacing, that are more kind of routine projects the NCDOT prepares and the MPO doesn't get as involved. So today, we are more focused on highway, bicycle and pedestrian projects because that's where the MPO gets involved."
   
 The draft project list planning process started back in spring 2019 when a steering committee met and public input meetings were held to identify necessary projects. A public survey followed online, as well as stakeholder interviews and more public input meetings throughout the summer. The steering committee met again in the fall, and public input meetings will continue through the winter.
   
 The draft project list is expected to be completed by mid-February, Zuyeva said. Another public input meeting will be held before the BGMPO adopts the draft list, they hope in May, she said.
   
 "There's still room to modify," Zuyeva said. "There still remains some analysis and refinement to be done."
