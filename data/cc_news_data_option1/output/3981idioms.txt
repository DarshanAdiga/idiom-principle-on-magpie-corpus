Last month, while addressing his party workers, Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan had asserted that the 'nature of alliance' in Bihar is changing. He asked his party members to be prepared for any eventuality. Nobody then realized that his words would turn prophetic. As the process of election for the 243-member Bihar assembly elections has been set in motion, the game of jumping parties too has started. And it is not confined to party hoppers. For the first time, Bihar will be witnessing no less than four alliances trying their luck in the electoral arena. The faces of alliances have changed since 2015 but in all these alliances, regional parties or state parties are the major players. Click here for full coverage of Bihar Assembly Election 2020.Take a look at the alliances. National Democratic Alliance (NDA)Initially an alliance of three parties - the BJP, the JD (U) and the LJP - it was sitting pretty because it has all the three formidable parties in its alliance. It got a boost with Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM-S announcing to join the alliance after leaving the Grand Alliance. The alliance, based on the 2015 performance, looks to be a formidable one on papers. The four together won on 127 out of 143 seats, although Nitish Kumar JD (U) was then a part of the Grand Alliance and had won on 71 seats. The alliance is fighting once again projecting Nitish Kumar as CM, which led to LJP walking out of the NDA. Grand Alliance The Grand Alliance comprising the RJD, Congress and Left parties are in direct fight with the NDA. The alliance has suffered setbacks with HAM-S and Upendra Kushwaha-led Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leaving the alliance. The alliance, in its present form and based on 2015 performance, had won 110 seats with a vote share of approximately 30%. The alliance has projected Lalu Prasad's son Tejashwi Yadav as CM candidate. Progressive Democratic Alliance (PDA) It is a newly-formed alliance led by former MP Rajiv Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav-led Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) and Chandrasekhar Azad's Azad Samaj Party. The PDA also includes the Bahujan Mukti Party (BMP) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) of MK Faizi to fight against the NDA and other fronts in the upcoming Bihar Assembly polls. This is a new alliance and will contest polls in Bihar for the first time although Pappu Yadav is not new to electoral politics. Fourth Alliance (RLSP-BSP) After walking out of the Grand Alliance and failing to get an audience from either the BJP or the JD (U), the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) president Upendra Kushwaha formed a yet to be named front with Mayawati's party, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Janwadi Party (Socialist) to contest the Bihar assembly elections to present to the people a "positive choice" and not to split the opposition votes. Kushwaha said that the alliance will have some other smaller parties too. Kushwaha was part of the NDA in the 2015 assembly election with NDA before 2019 Lok Sabha polls. He was also a minister of state for human resource development under Prime Minister Narendra Modi till December 2017. The RLSP, which contested the 2015 assembly polls in Bihar as NDA ally had contested on 23 seats and won 2 with a vote share of 27.50%. The BSP, on the other hand, had contested independently on 228 seats and lost deposit on 225 seats and could get only 2.21 % votes.

Lead has been making lower high and lower low on daily scale which is indication of bearish trend. It is also trading below 20 and 50 DMA. Next support comes around 200 DMA which is around 142 levels. Any bounce near 148 is being sold into indicating bears strong hold on the commodity. Only closing above 150 can we see bullish upside momentum. So we recommend to sell around 148 for expected target of 142 and stoploss of 150.

El presidente de la República, Martín Vizcarra, estimó este domingo que la economía del país regrese a una situación previo a la pandemia del COVID-19 en un plazo de tres años. “Hemos hecho un análisis y vamos a regresar en tres años a la situación previa [a la pandemia del COVID-19]. La clase media que se vio afectada, retornará con esta recuperación”, indicó el mandatario en diálogo con “Punto Final”. El mandatario aseguró que la caída de la economía terminaría este año, y a partir del próximo comenzaría la recuperación. Vizcarra proyectó que el Producto Bruto Interno (PBI) del país caería 1% en diciembre, acumulando un desplome de 12% en todo el 2020. El próximo año iniciará el rebote por un efecto estadístico. “Hemos llegado a bajar 40% en el mes de abril. Cada mes estamos subiendo. A fin de año vamos a llegar casi a cero. A partir de ahí, todo es crecer”, subrayó el jefe del Estado. “El crecimiento del segundo trimestre del próximo año, va a estar largamente por sobre lo que teníamos. Vamos a dejar encaminado para que mi sucesor, cuando asuma la presidencia el 28 de julio de 2021, encuentre todo en crecimiento”, añadió. El presidente Vizcarra indicó que el programa Trabaja Perú ya implementó 140,000 puestos de trabajo, la mitad del total proyectado. Además, aseguró que Arranca Perú ya transfirió el presupuesto a todos los gobiernos locales para realizar el mantenimiento de 50,000 kilómetros de vías, bajo la supervisión del Ministerio de Transportes y Comunicaciones (MTC).

By Dhirendra Kumar A couple of days ago, in a webinar I was invited to, I came across a question that really bothered me. In fact, it is still bothering me. Someone wanted advice on post-retirement income. That is, on generating income from savings after retirement. Except for the lucky few who have an adequate inflation-linked pension, this is a problem that everyone of us has to solve at some point. This person had just retired and had savings of about Rs 50 lakh. He said that his lifestyle was modest and all he wanted was a steady Rs 40,000 a month. He just needed some guidance as to what was the best way to generate that income. His query was almost the same as that of a relative of mine who had asked me about generating an income of Rs 1 lakh a month from savings of about Rs 80 lakh. Neither of these people had any anxiety about their question and that’s something that has caused me a lot of anxiety. They took it as a matter of course that they needed to find out how to generate their required income and then just settle down to a long and happy retirement. Can you see the problem here? It’s blindingly obvious to anyone who has a good awareness about inflation and returns. These are the middle-class people who have earned a modest salary all their lives. Now they are retiring and they have at their disposal an amount which to them feels like a lot of money. Sure, in many contexts, these are large sums. However, they are not even remotely adequate to generate the kind of income that these retirees are expecting. Given the expected life spans nowadays, that income will have to be sustainesd for some 20-30 years. Why are they under this delusion? The reason is something I try to hammer home every time I write about retirement. They understand returns but do not understand inflation. They understand how income compounds but do not understand how inflation ‘decompounds’ it. Nominally, Rs 40,000 a month requires a return of 9.6% from Rs 50 lakh. Rs 1 lakh a month requires a return of 12% from Rs 80 lakh. On the face of it, it’s doable. The latter is a stretch but not by much. If there was no inflation in the world then the two would look forward to a long and happy stretch of golden years. But no, that will not happen. Prices will rise and the money will not be enough. They’ll start digging into their capital. They may not even realise it for a few years because while the nominal value of the savings will be maintained or even grow a bit, the real inflation-adjusted value (purchasing power) will keep declining. In a decade or so, they will be looking at the biggest tragedy of retirement—old age poverty. This is not a mere theory. Look around yourself, you will see any number of older people who are already facing this tragedy. So how much will these two retirees be able to safely generate from their savings? At Value Research, we have done a lot of study on this problem and think that a withdrawal rate of roughly 4% is quite safe. If you do well with your investments then in the long run, a high rate of 6% may be possible but in the early years one needs to keep it as low as possible. For my two examples, that gives us Rs 16,000-18,000 a month out of Rs 50 lakh, or maybe Rs 30,000 for the second case. Like I said, it’s a tragedy in the making, one that to me is the most bothersome part of the Indian savings scenario. For those who still have some time to go for retirement, please pay heed to these numbers and ensure that you are never faced with this problem. On Value Research Online, we have a lot of good information and tools to help you plan your savings, and the earlier you take the opportunity, the happier you will be in your old age.

As for upgrades, the front camera has moved from top side to right side on the display bezel (in vertical orientation). Though a minor change, the new placement of the front camera makes it more suitable for the screen-unlock mechanism, video calls and other camera utilities. On the back, the SPen's storage-cum-charging garage has got better magnets. Even without the Book Cover, which sticks on the back and doubles up as a tablet stand, the SPen sticks to the tablet's body and does not come off unless you want it to. Speaking of the Book Cover, it is an optional accessory that comes with a keyboard. Named Book Cover Keyboard, both accessories have improved exponentially in terms of design and utility. For example, compared to the Tab S6's adhesive-based book cover, the Tab S7+'s Book Cover has magnets ensuring it firmly sticks to the tablet body. It does not accidentally detach when if you push open its flip bottom to turn it into a tablet stand.
