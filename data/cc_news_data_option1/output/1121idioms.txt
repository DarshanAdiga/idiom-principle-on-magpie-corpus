 Gogoi, a former Chief Justice of India who headed benches that delivered key judgements like the Ayodhya verdict and on the Rafale deal, took oath as a Rajya Sabha MP on Thursday. He was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by President Ram Nath Kovind.
 Singh, who had filed a case against the BJP government on the Rafale deal, said in a tweet in Hindi that "Gogoi"s game is now clear".
 "What was the deal for Ranjan Gogoi"s Rafale deal? It should be investigated… The Rafale case should be heard again. Gogoi refused to listen to me in the Rafael case. Now it is clear what the game was. Ranjan Gogoi is a black spot on the judiciary, which will take years to fade," Singh said.

It’s not easy to lose good people. But that’s exactly what happened this week when the Philadelphia Eagles decided not to bring safety Malcolm Jenkins back. The Eagles didn’t exercise their option on Jenkins’ contract. As a result, he became an unrestricted free agent and eventually returned to the New Orleans Saints where he reportedly signed a four-year, $32 million contract.
 How do you replace a guy like him? That’s the question. Jenkins is the best safety the Eagles have had since Hall of Famer Brian Dawkins played the position.
 Jenkins is one of the best defenders in the NFL. He played safety for the Eagles, but could play anywhere in the secondary.
 The Eagles are trying to get younger with some of their free agents they’re bring in. Jenkins is 32-years-old. He is getting older, but he can still play the game. His leadership on this team was nothing short of sensational.
 Jenkins was always there. In 2009 he was a first-round pick out of Ohio State University by the Saints. Jenkins won a Super Bowl with the Saints as a rookie. He played five years in New Orleans before signing with the Eagles as a free agent in 2014.
 During his time in Philly, he made three Pro Bowls and helped the Eagles win a Super Bowl in 2018. He may best the free agent signing the team has ever made.
 Jenkins played safety like Garry Maddox played centerfield with the Phillies. Very few deep passes were completed with him playing safety. The biggest thing about Jenkins’ value to this teams was his durability. He never missed a game during his time with the Eagles. That’s incredible. To be able to play every snap with the way players get injured in the NFL is really amazing.
 Speaking of amazing, Jenkins had quite a legacy off the field. He was involved with a number of community efforts. One of them was the Malcolm Jenkins Foundation’s partnership with Drexel University, which sponsored a free summer camp for kids in the West Philadelphia Promise Zone.
 It was a six-week Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Athletics and Math (STEAM) summer program for middle school students. Seventy youngsters from the West Philadelphia community near Drexel got a chance to participate in some meaningful summer activities.
 Jenkins is a special person. The Eagles task is to find a replacement for him between now and the start of next season. Jenkins got it done on and off the field. And that’s hard to replace.

After my wife passed away after a 19-year struggle with breast cancer, I found myself in the dating pool for the first time in over 30 years. As a widower, I dabbled in the black arts of internet dating with varying degrees of success but nothing really stuck.
 Then a friend told me she knew someone who would be perfect for me. I agreed to meet this friend at Pinot Bistro, a restaurant in Studio City, and we would see where it went. (I was skeptical. She lived in Valencia; I lived in Sherman Oaks, which meant she was “GU” — geographically undesirable, a term I learned from my internet dating stint.) I found her sitting at the bar. She gave me the once over and slyly grinned with approval. I once-overed her, and yeah, nice.
 Maybe our matchmaker friend knew what she was doing.
 We headed to the dining room and had a magical time, enjoying the food, the company — talking until the restaurant closed. She was a single mother who had raised her teenage son with the help of her mother, who lived with her.

At a recent dinner party, it was wondered why our society appears to be pulling apart. I observed sometimes unfortunate consequences flow from otherwise benign changes. I illustrated with a "tale of two families," both known to me in my rural central Illinois setting.
 When I was a boy post-World War II, small towns and cities not too different from mine tended to have a more diverse and balanced economic mix than today, or so I aver. There would be a small manufacturer or two, generally family owned; a banker or two; several doctors; a number of independent main street businesses; factory workers, school janitors, farmers.
 The leading families did indeed, in my town at least, live on a hill, and there were the right and wrong sides of the railroad track. Yet, the bankers' children went to the same local public school along with the janitors' kids. Sometimes their kids even married. Most families, certainly the factory workers who often car-pooled to one of the Caterpillar Inc. plants in Peoria, considered themselves properly middle class.
 This brings me to the two families I use to illustrate how we have tended to pull apart in socioeconomic terms since then.
 In 1970, Ron Anderson worked at CAT, earning about $50,000 in today's dollars; his wife Nancy was a stay-at-home mom, as were most. Down at the end of the block, general practitioner Dr. Jim Smith earned, say, $150,000; wife Susan, a registered nurse, stayed home with their young children. The ratio of the doc's income to that of the factory worker, about 3-1. Both were solidly middle class.
 Half a century later, their grandchildren are in markedly different situations. Grandson Ron Anderson works at a hog slaughtering plant (the grandad's good job at CAT no longer existing), earning about $25,000 a year; wife Marilee works, out of necessity, at Walmart, almost full time, for about $15,000. Thus, a total of $40,000 a year.
 Dr. Jim Smith III is a specialist earning about $250,000 a year; his wife, Betsy, also an MD, also earns $250,000, or more. They live in a gated community in suburban Chicago, near a medical center. Their total income of half a million dollars a year is at least 12 times that of the Ron Anderson family.
 In 1970, there were few single-parent families. Today, there are many single- parent households in small-town America, the mom's education often stopped at high school by the demands of parenting. These often-stressed-out mothers earn maybe $15,000 a year in minimum-wage jobs, or from welfare. Their income is but one-third or less that of the Smiths. The single moms' (there are a tiny number of single-dad households) parenting skills are limited at best, though there are exceptions, as always.
 Over about two generations, family situations have in many cases like these pulled far apart, for three simple and otherwise benign reasons: women work today, and at any positions to which they aspire, and, third, like kinds marry.
 If there is anything to what I observe here -- and you can look around you to see if I am right or not -- what to do? I am not a parent, so I am the last person who should be giving advice, yet that has never stopped me before.
 First, much more attention should be given by community organizations and schools to coaching young parents, especially those with limited positive support systems, about how to nurture and support the educational aspirations of their children. This coaching should encourage the setting of high expectations for educational achievement and career success. Chinese families probably go overboard in this regard, yet it apparently helps generate high- achieving outcomes.
 Second, since teen birth rates are down dramatically in the past 20 years, we should learn more about why this has occurred and do all we can to encourage the trendline down even further.
 Third, traditional marriage rates are down among young people. We need to understand better the consequences of this, both bad and maybe good, and of what society might do to nudge young people to develop positive game plans for any parenting that is in their futures.

SPRINGFIELD,Mo. (KY3/Gray News) - Amid the empty shelves and store closures during the coronavirus outbreak, a Missouri Walmart had its own commotion going Wednesday afternoon.A baby was born in the toilet paper aisle of the store.“We were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,” said store manager Jessica Hinkle.Hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. When the woman’s water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right there.“We were like, ‘What do we do now?’” she said. “Another lady comes around the corner and she says, ‘I’m a labor nurse, can I help?’ And we said, ‘Yes, yes please.’ She had gloves in her pocket (and) she was ready.”Hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible.“Crowd control, (I’m) not like the best with blood so that was my job, holding the sheet and crowd control, making sure that nobody invaded what privacy the poor lady still had,” Hinkle said.Springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl."They're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves," Hinkle said.She said the entire process took about 45 minutes, and customers were cheering for the woman the whole time.“They took her out on the gurney, there were customers of course gathered. She kind of raised her hand, everyone clapped for her,” Hinkle said.The Walmart birth was the touch of happiness Hinkle said everyone needed.“You know a feel-good moment, everybody’s going through so much, and with a baby it’s like everything comes full circle,” she said.Hinkle said she did touch base with the woman Thursday. She said both mom and baby are doing well.Copyright 2020 KY3 via Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

Paul Gritten, non-motorized trail coordinator with Wyoming State Parks, said getting outside can be extremely therapeutic in these troubling times.
 “With so much doom and gloom in the news, getting out and being physically active can truly help reduce stress,” Gritten said. “It offers a change to get your mind off of what is going on, and just enjoy being outdoors.”
 Even when there’s snow in the forecast, the opportunity may arise for an ardent snowball fight, if not a trek to the mountains to go snowshoeing. With kids being cooped up and restless, even short activities outdoors can be helpful. In addition, aside from a few bucks for entry or parking fees, most outdoor activities are free.
 The latest data with the novel coronavirus is that it does not last very long on objects outside because of exposure to sunlight. However, there could be a problem if someone coughs into their hand and then immediately touches an object and then another person touches that object immediately after them.
 With that in mind, playgrounds in parks are getting mixed reviews. The CDC offers no current guidance on how to manage these spaces. Keeping children at safe distances from each other can be challenging, so one recommendation is to go only with family to avoid contact with others.
 There is no question this is a fluid and evolving situation. Keep alert to any additional advice from the CDC on outdoor recreation precautions. Based on current guidelines, getting outside is safe if there are no other humans around. If on a trail or pathway where others are also enjoying the outdoors, just communicate from a distance to ensure that six feet of separation is maintained.

Filming of scripted-reality television show The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE) has been postponed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.
 The ITVBe show, which has launched the careers of stars including Gemma Collins, Joey Essex and Mark Wright, was due to commence filming for a new series next week.
 ITV said the move was to ensure the "safety of the cast and crew".
 The show often features the cast at bars and events.
 In a statement on Twitter, ITV said: "In light of the spread of Covid-19, after much consideration, it has been decided that filming on TOWIE will be postponed until further notice.

It seems like our whole world has been canceled in the past week. Coronavirus has changed our daily lives from school closings to large events being postponed or canceled.
 Yes, the word “canceled” is all over the place, but we’re (rightly so) more concerned about making sure we all stay safe and healthy. As we all adjust to a radically different world than the one we lived in a week ago, I’m going to focus for a minute on British and American English spellings. By doing so, we can know the correct way to spell “canceled” in the U.S.
 Why are so many British and American English words spelled differently? Look no further than the All-American boy Noah Webster Jr. In addition to being buddies with Alexander Hamilton, serving in the Connecticut House of Representatives, and being a fascinating character, Webster was a lexicographer, which is a fancy way of saying “word nerd.” In 1806 he published his first dictionary, called _A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language_.
 Much of Webster’s influence came from his spelling reform. While spelling reform doesn’t sound all that revolutionary, I appreciate Webster’s American view of questioning the way things had always been done. Although he introduced many ideas of different and simplified ways to spell words, Webster gets credit for “defense” (instead of “defence”), “color” (instead of “colour”), and “plow” (instead of “plough”). His 1828 _An American Dictionary of the English Language_ was Webster’s first comprehensive dictionary. It established many of the spelling differences between British and American English, although many other simplifications (like “tung” instead of “tongue” and “soop” instead of “soup”) didn’t catch on.

In an age where genetically engineered antibodies are the new norm, convalescent plasma seems quaint. And for drug companies that require a profitable market to justify the design and production of a new vaccine it is a distinctly unprofitable approach, he said.
 “But the fact is, there is no reason that, if properly selected and screened, it can’t work,” he said. The only question, he added, is whether the current crisis is urgent enough to return to a tried-and-true approach that has gone out of favor.
 In the early 20th century, convalescent plasma was used during outbreaks of polio, measles, mumps and flu, including the devastating 1918 influenza pandemic. Then, the process was often as primitive as putting two patients — one sick and the other recovered — on a pair of adjoining gurneys and running a blood transfusion line between them.
 Today, the process would be far less simple.
 First, researchers would have to discern when recovered patients’ COVID-19 antibody levels peak, and how long it takes for them to completely clear the virus. Both require the use of tests that are used only in research labs today, a practical hurdle that would require FDA action. Next, they’d separate and extract so-called neutralizing antibodies from the donated blood. Then lab workers would aggregate those antibodies into large batches and purify the resulting serum.
 On average, Casadevall said, the neutralizing antibodies harvested from one robustly recovered individual might treat, or induce immunity in, as many as two others. The therapy could be made in batches that would combine the plasma of as many as 1,000 recovered patients, producing many doses at once

Under the influence of raw material, market competitions and economic conditions, the price of GPS Tracking Devices was lower year by year from 102 USD/Unit in 2012 to 101 USD/Unit in 2016. The profit margin is relatively high, about 33% in 2016. In the next few years, we predict that price will continue to decline. As competition intensifies, prices gap between different brands will go narrowing.

The report will look at the global market for the various components that comprise an MV system. These components have been undergoing constant upgrading in terms of sophistication, but they also provide easier operation. Their prices continue to fall, so the MV industry has been characterized by improving price and performance ratios. This has made the market for MV components very competitive. This study will examine the nature of the competition and offer a regional breakdown of this market. This report also covers the outlook of future global markets for MV systems and the technologies that will be involved. Starting with some basic industrial applications two decades ago in a few selected countries, the growth of this technology has allowed it to penetrate varied non-industrial fields, and the market has become global in nature.

In the coming days, a team of us scouted locations. We settled on a St. Michael’s research building across the street from our ER on Shuter. It’s a single large room we can easily reconfigure, and it had automatic doors to minimize potential contamination. Our facilities and engineering team began construction in the research building last Saturday, working overnight to get the centre ready in time for Monday. They installed massive fans that suck in the air and expel it through a HEPA filter, which cleans the air before it leaves the building. They built walls approximately nine feet tall in the testing areas, so if someone sneezed, the virus wouldn’t be able to travel over the top. The walls and dividers they built were covered in plastic sheathing for easier cleaning. Once construction was completed on Sunday, our design-simulation team did walkthroughs to address bottleneck spots and determine where signs and markings on the floor were needed to direct people. Our team held an employee training session and opened the centre the very next day.
