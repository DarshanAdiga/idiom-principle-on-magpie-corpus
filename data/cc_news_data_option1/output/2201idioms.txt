"Listening to players and reading their social media, the strength they have shown and the experiences they have shared has been powerful. It has impacted me. I realize I have a long way to go, but I will keep listening and learning," Elway added. "That is the only way to grow.

London [UK], June 6 (ANI): Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Friday said that the team has been working on 'new ideas' ahead of their return to Premier League action.   The Premier League on Friday confirmed the fixtures for the first three-match rounds of the 2019/20 season which will resume from June 17 after coronavirus hiatus.   The showpiece event will resume with Aston Villa taking on Sheffield United and Manchester City competing against Arsenal.   "We've been looking forward to these games for ages really. It does make it feel like 'yes, we're here soon.' The first game is two weeks from today so we need to step up the training and get an edge to our game again," the club's official website quoted Solskjaer as saying.   "Training has been about recapping what we did well, tweaking maybe one or two things and looking at some new ideas, but hopefully we can see a lot of what we saw towards the end before the lockdown," he added.   Manchester United will lock horns with Tottenham Hotspur on June 19 in their first match. All matches will be played behind closed doors.   "We've got games coming weekend, midweek, weekend for a spell so you have to focus on ourselves and not just on that one, first game," said Solskjaer.   Before the suspension of the Premier League due to the coronavirus-pandemic, Liverpool was at the top of the standings and was 25 points ahead of the second-placed Manchester City. Liverpool is just two wins away from lifting the title. (ANI)

While many claim that it could be Germany's reply to the lineup offered by French-established Bugatti, others choose to focus more on what electric hypercars are capable of in current times.(Also read: This 'Made in Sri Lanka' electric luxury supercar is a 900 bhp powerhouse)Even though it is currently in concept form, the company claims that Elektron One is capable of firing itself to 100 kmph in just 2.1 seconds and that it would have a top speed of 400 kmph. Its four motors enable energy loss-free four-wheel drive and real time torque vectoring. Regenerative braking allows for stored energy to be reused while an active suspension system which collects real-time data helps adjust drive characteristics and vehicle height as per road condition or driver preference.The best part of it all, however, would be that that Elektron One would be a zero-emission vehicle as there is no internal combustion engine on board.Elektron One would perhaps get a price tag far lower than some of the most popular Bugatti models. Reports suggest it could be priced somewhere between $370,000 and $400,000.It is reported that just 140 units are expected to be made once Elektron One does enter production.",
