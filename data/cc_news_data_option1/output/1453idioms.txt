Layne, whose office would oversee the new fund, said the administration proposes to funnel the aid through existing programs for small businesses and housing that the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development already runs.
 The fund also would be another way to help organizations that care for the most vulnerable populations, including assisted living facilities that don't receive Medicaid funding as nursing homes do.
 "We haven't decided how the money is going to be split yet," he said.
 Stimulus funds
 Layne said the governor's proposal, subject to approval by the General Assembly when it reconvenes on April 22, would "give us time to really get a handle on these stimulus funds" which Congress and President Donald Trump approved late last month in response to the crisis.
 The CARES Act includes $2.2 trillion in federal emergency aid, including $3.3 billion in state and local government relief in Virginia, but the state remains uncertain how it will be allowed to spend the money. The law forbids state and local governments from using the money to back fill the loss of tax revenues, but they are urging guidance that gives them more flexibility in using the federal aid to avoid major cuts in programs and jobs that would make the crisis worse.
 Medicaid
 Medicaid could be a major source of relief. The federal government and states share the costs of the health insurance for the poor, elderly and disabled, based on a matching formula that varies from state to state.
 In Virginia, the state and federal government share those costs equally, but the Families First Act, the second of three emergency relief bills Congress adopted last month, would boost the federal share by 6.2% and lower the state's share by a corresponding amount.
 Virginia finance officials say that would free about $150 million in state funds every three months, dating back to Jan. 1, but they have resisted requests from a wide range of organizations seeking a share of the savings. The finance officials' strategy for surviving the crisis depends on maintaining as much liquidity as possible to ensure the state has cash on hand to pay for core services.
 "That is the most flexible pool of federal funds we have to work with right now," said Deputy Secretary of Finance Joe Flores, a former budget analyst on health and human resources issues for the Senate Finance Committee.

The livestream appearance more neatly wrapped up the Democratic primary than Sanders' slow exit in 2016.
 Back then, he actively stayed in the race through all the primaries and endorsed Hillary Clinton on July 12, two weeks before she'd officially earn the nomination at the Democratic National Convention.
 When Sanders dropped out last week he said he'd still be on the ballot in the remaining states. He'd also keep his delegates in order to pressure Biden to back more progressive positions.
 Biden began that process by vowing to move the Medicare age to 60 - it's currently 65 - and supporting some student loan forgiveness.
 But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a top Sanders surrogates, called the Medicare move 'almost insulting,' as Clinton had even pitched moving the age where people could start buying in to Medicare to 50.
 In order to excite progressive voters, she suggested, Biden would need to prove that he was more than just a 'harm reduction' candidate and 'there's actually going to be progress made for us.'

While many Topekans celebrated Easter inside on Sunday, the tulips and plants at the Ted Ensley Garden had no choice but to withstand the rainy, cold weather.
   
 The timing of a cold front that followed 70-degree weather earlier this weekend, as well as the statewide stay-at-home order that is still in effect, put a damper on an event traditionally known as Tulip Time.

But one silver lining of this crisis is that, for many of those agencies, this crisis will have been a dry run. We are learning on the fly that it is important to be able to get bigger unemployment checks to more people faster; we are learning how to get money in the hands of businesses that have temporarily lost their whole customer base but can expect to get it back, if only they make it through this; we are learning how to get tax-rebate payments to as many Americans as possible as quickly as possible. After this acute crisis is over, policy-makers should consider what we learned and what infrastructure we need to stand up our economic-response programs much more quickly if we have to do this again.

Karen Schaeffer has been in business for 29 years, and before this month, she had never missed or been late with a rent payment.
   
 But the coronavirus pandemic has left Schaeffer, and many small-business owners across the country, worried. Schaeffer questions how she will afford this month's expenses -- or even next month's, as the virus knows no economic timeline.
   
 "I'm struggling," Schaeffer said, her voice cracking with emotion. "This has been really hard for me, because I wasn't able to make my rent payment. My landlord still wanted partial rent. They agreed to put part of it at the back end of my lease, but they wanted part of it for April, even though my shop hasn't been open since March 17."
   
 Schaeffer owns Mommy and Me, a consignment shop at 3703 S.W. Burlingame Road in Topeka that specializes in clothing and accessories for children and expecting mothers. The decision to temporarily close, Schaeffer said, was a difficult one to make, but she didn't want to put her employees at risk.
   
 "It was extremely difficult, because I felt, I still feel, that we have a void in the market for those people who are needing spring clothes, summer clothes, infant items, maternity items, nursing items. We fill that need in the community," she said. "It was very difficult to decide. Although, I wanted to protect my employees from being exposed to it."
   
 She said by the time she closed Mommy and Me's doors, sales had already dropped, as people had begun doing less in-person shopping amid county and statewide stay-at-home orders.
   
 Schaeffer has had to furlough all six of her employees, and her staff wasn't able to celebrate the store's 29th anniversary on April 1.
   
 "Every year we have an anniversary celebration, and we donate 10% of our profits to a charity that we select," Schaeffer said. "This year it was a lot different. ... We hope to have an anniversary celebration but just much later."
   
 She is still unsure when that might be, and her biggest worry centers on the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19.
   
 "That's my worry," Schaeffer said, "is how long it will take to get back to where things were, where I was able to pay employees and pay rent and pay my bills on time."
   
 John Benedict, owner of Chuckburger Drive-Thru in East Topeka, has experienced similar downfalls.
   
 Like Schaeffer, Benedict said he chose to temporarily close up shop because he didn't want to possibly contribute to the spread of COVID-19.
   
 "As difficult as it may be, sometimes you've got to be the first business that says, 'Hey, it's not all about our profits,' " Benedict said. "It's about my employees' safety. It's about my customers' safety. It's about the safety of all my vendors."
   
 And he said the closure had nothing to do with business slowing down.
   
 "I've owned Chuckburger for over 20 years," Benedict said, "and we've had the three best days sales-wise in the last two weeks preceding our closure. Maybe it's because we're a drive-through and other places you couldn't go in and that drove up our business, but Chuckburger was doing business the likes of which we hadn't really done before."
   
 After deciding to close, Benedict said, he withdrew almost $5,000 from his personal savings account -- money he had planned to use as a down payment on a new home -- so that he could offer some monetary relief to his employees.
   
 "Being that most of my employees are just fast-food restaurant workers," he said, "a lot of them don't have a great deal of savings. I'm not sure if they live paycheck to paycheck, more so maybe month to month. ... I felt like I needed to take care of my employees who have helped make Chuckburger successful over all these years.
   
 "Me buying a house can just wait," he added. "It's not the most important thing right now."
   
 Jenny Torrence, who owns three storefronts in Topeka's NOTO Arts & Entertainment District, also chose to close her businesses -- and one of them, NOTO Burrito, may not be opening back up.
   
 However, that wasn't strictly a monetary decision. Torrence announced in a blog post Sunday that the time away from the daily operations of her businesses has allowed her to reflect on where she devotes her energy.
   
 She wrote in her blog post that it is time for her to "hand off the proverbial torch" to the next person in line who has a passion for the restaurant business and is ready to take on the challenge of seeing NOTO through its next eight years.
   
 Torrence also owns Pinkadilly, a clothing boutique in NOTO, and co-owns Serendipity, an event space there. Right now, Torrence said, she isn't struggling financially, but that could change, depending on how long it takes to move past the economic fallout of COVID-19.
   
 "We're early on in it, so right now I'm not stressing," Torrence said, "but if I have to keep Serendipity closed -- and it's hefty, the overhead (expenses) -- I would really start stressing in a couple months."
   
 For now, the small-business owner is choosing to focus on the positive.
   
 "I believe that the universe always provides," she said. "This has made us all slow down and it's made us reflect and it's made us stay in and maybe reach out to more people and talk to them and communicate with them in different ways. I have to see the blessing -- in that although some doors are closing, lots of other doors are opening."
   
 Schaeffer and Benedict have each said they are looking into economic relief options to help their businesses and employees through this time of uncertainty, but neither has received much help from local or national entities just yet.
   
 Schaeffer received some good news Friday after talking with Shawnee County Emergency Management. She said the agency is allowing her to reopen Mommy and Me, deeming it an essential business for the "welfare and needs of children."
   
 Schaeffer said she is still trying to determine when she will reopen and said it will likely be after the Shawnee County area has passed its peak in coronavirus cases, which some experts have predicted could be later this month. When she does reopen, Schaeffer said, she may offer services such as personal shopping, which would minimize the number of people in her store at one time.
   
 For the time being, Schaeffer is pursuing monetary assistance through the U.S. Small Business Administration, but she said that process has been confusing and still hasn't resulted in any sort of return.
   
 "It's just been very time consuming. It's been very stressful because of all the confusion," she said.
   
 Benedict said he also hasn't yet seen any economic relief. He has been looking into the Greater Topeka Partnership's HOST Relief Program, which promises to offer immediate relief and long-term recovery incentives to small businesses in Shawnee County.
   
 "Depending on how long the closure of Chuckburger lasts, any additional funds that I receive from any of these programs I plan to pass them down to my employees, as well," Benedict said. "Maybe use a small share of it to pay utilities and stuff like that, but most of it would be going to my employees."
   
 Schaeffer hopes that people in Topeka and Shawnee County don't forget about the area's small businesses in coming months. If they do, she said, some of them won't survive.
   
 "Remember the small businesses when we come back," she said. "I know that online shopping has become very popular, but (I want) to remind people that if they don't remember the small business when we get back, all they will have left is online shopping and they'll lose the convenience of us being open every day for quick items that they might need.
   
 "Who's winning in this situation is Walmart and Old Navy and Target and all the places who can stay open and order online."
   
 In addition to supporting local, Benedict hopes the current situation inspires people to help one another. He said at times like this, community members coming together may offer a glimmer of hope.
   
 "I just pray that this, COVID-19, we'll be able to overcome it," he said. "Hopefully, for some people there will be a time in the future where people can look back and say, 'This was their finest moment. This is when they came together to make a difference. This is when the doctors and the nurses and everybody came together to make the world a better place.'"

Napoli head coach Maurizio Sarri says he will not punish Lorenzo Insigne for his reaction to being substituted in the Serie A defeat to Juventus on Saturday.
 The Italy international was visibly angry after being replaced by Emanuele Giaccherini 61 minutes into the game at Juventus Stadium, in which former Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain scored the goal to seal a 2-1 victory for the home side.
 Insigne is reported to have apologised to his coach on Sunday and has trained as normal, with a view to starting Tuesday's key Champions League clash with Besiktas in Istanbul.
 While Sarri would not rule out any retrospective action from the club, he stressed that he will not punish Insigne personally for his "silly" outburst.
 "If the club decides to fine him then they'll do so," he told a media conference. "There won't be a personal punishment, though. I don't do personal vendettas, I do what's good for the team.
 "I'll make any decisions for the good of the team, not as a result of these silly things done by a young lad."
 Napoli sit top of Group B after three matches, but are just a point above Besiktas, after they suffered a surprise 3-2 defeat to the Super Lig champions at the San Paolo on matchday three.
 "We made mistakes in the first game. Clearly we have to avoid the mistakes like the one which led to the 2-1," said Sarri.
 "I'm happy to play in such a passionate stadium, it's a pleasure for everyone. The team has the personality to withstand it and they showed that in Turin, where we never panicked and caused Juve more problems than they caused us.
 "We need to cut out the errors. In Turin, we gave our best defensive performance, we had more shots than they did and we didn't give too much away.
 "They are unbeaten in Turkey and in Europe, so we should worry about their strength rather than the atmosphere. But we're ready."

Maurizio Sarri has backed Manolo Gabbiadini to step into the void in Napoli's attack left by Arkadiusz Milik's injury-enforced absence when they host Roma on Saturday.
 Milik has settled into life in Italy well following his close-season move from Ajax, scoring seven goals in nine appearances in all competitions.
 However, Napoli's replacement for Gonzalo Higuain is set for a lengthy period on the sidelines after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament while on international duty with Poland.
 That leaves Sarri short of an out-and-out striker, but the Napoli boss is confident his squad, and particularly Gabbiadini, are capable of stepping up and delivering the goals they need.
 "They [Milik and Gabbiadini] play in almost the same way," he said. "Milik isn't there, now Gabbiadini is.
 "We'll figure something out, because Manolo can't play all the time, but for me he just has to play. He's a great player.
 "We have different solutions, it depends on the match. I think [Dries] Mertens can do better against teams which sit in, while [Jose] Callejon can do well in behind teams if they push the defence up."
 Prior to the international break Napoli suffered their first defeat of the Serie A campaign against Atalanta, something Sarri is keen to quickly put behind them for the visit of top-three rivals Roma.
 "It's an important game for us, we're coming off a bad performance," he added.
 "Roma are very good in attack, so it’s a complicated game. I hope the team is good, Bergamo might have left us with some uncertainty.
 "We need to grow in some games where we haven't expressed ourselves to the maximum, we have to grow because we have a lot of youngsters.
 "We need to fulfil our potential and if we can do that we can open up an important cycle."

As other countries have looked enviously at South Korea’s effective response to the coronavirus crisis, we keep hearing that that country had the advantage of a dry run: In 2015, South Korea faced an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a coronavirus that is more deadly but less contagious than the one we’re fighting now. South Korea learned what had worked in that fight and what needed to be done differently, and the government developed epidemic-response capabilities it could take right out of the box for this crisis, which allowed South Koreans to achieve better infection control with less economic disruption than in the U.S. and Europe.
