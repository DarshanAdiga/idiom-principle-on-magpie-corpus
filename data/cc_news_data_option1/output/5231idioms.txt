However, in Game 3, both Frank Ntilikina (Achilles soreness) and Austin Rivers (sore right groin) were sidelined. Elfrid Payton started and logged 25 minutes, but with the Knicks down 18 points in the second half, coach Tom Thibodeau turned to his youngsters to provide a spark. And that they did. Quickley spearheaded the charge by facilitating the offense (he dished out a game-high seven assists) and providing defensive intensity at the point of attack on the other end of the floor. New York outscored Cleveland by 22 points (37-15) in the final frame, closing out the game on a 21-7 run in the comeback victory. #KnicksTwitter began buzzing, intrigued by a very encouraging performance from Quickley, hoping to see more.

The Wildcats got the ball right back after Cameron Mitchell picked off a Fields sideline throw to set NU up at midfield. But the Cats lost nine yards in three plays, including an 8-yard sack, and were forced to punt.
 Finally, after Ohio State missed a field goal to blow its own red-zone opportunity, the Wildcats got into Ohio State territory, aided by 30 yards on roughing-the-passer and horse-collar calls against the Buckeyes. Again, the drive stalled, this time at the OSU 28, and Charlie Kuhbander missed a 46-yard field-goal attempt.
 From there, the Buckeyes cranked up Sermon and the ground game and put the game away. The Buckeyes scored 16 points on their next four possessions, with Sermon’s two touchdowns and a Blake Haubeil field goal.
 The Buckeyes’ first touchdown drive was a seven-play, all-run drive in the third. The second was the dagger – a nine-play drive in which Sermon carried it seven times for 64 yards, including the 3-yarder that turned out to be the last points of the game.
 Northwestern, meanwhile, turned the ball over on consecutive possessions bridging the third and fourth quarters, both in NU territory. The first was a Ramsey interception by Josh Proctor at the NU 41, the other a Ramsey fumble that was recovered by Pete Werner at the NU 35.
 Still, after Northwestern’s defense again held Ohio State to a field goal, it was just a one-score game at 16-10, with 12:07 remaining. But another NU punt and the second Sermon touchdown put the game out of reach.
 The second half was markedly different than the first, when Northwestern outplayed the Buckeyes to seize the lead.
 The Buckeyes opened the scoring on a Haubeil 41-yard field goal, but only after a Fields touchdown was called back because of a holding penalty.
 The Wildcats then answered with a seven-play, 75-yard touchdown drive that put the Ohio State defense on its heels and gave the momentum to the underdogs for the rest of the half. Moving Porter in and out of the Wildcat quarterback position throughout the possession, the Wildcats racked up 63 of those yards on five runs, including a 34-yarder from Ramsey and a 9-yard TD scamper by Porter.
 The Wildcats added to their lead in the second quarter, going 65 yards in 14 plays until it bogged down and Kuhbander hit a 47-yard field goal to make it 10-3.
 Northwestern’s defense, meanwhile, managed to make Fields look like a mere mortal. Defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz use a combination of blitzes and disguised coverages – sometimes blitzing on first down and dropping eight into coverage on third – to make Fields uncomfortable. They were at the best in the red zone, where the Buckeyes had just three points after three trips in the first half.
 Haubeil hit another field goal for the Buckeyes to close the gap to 10-6, and Ohio State was poised to score again near the end of the half, driving down inside the Northwestern 10. But on third-and-goal from the 8-yard line, Joseph intercepted fields on the end zone with a spectacular, leaping one-hand grab on a pass intended for Garrett Wilson that preserved the lead heading into the locker room at halftime.
 Fitzgerald said after the game that he was very proud of his team, but lamented the self-inflicted mistakes that discounted an otherwise stellar performance.
 “We didn't come down here to play hard,” said Fitzgerald, who has now lost two Big Ten title games after losing to these same Buckeyes in 2018. “We came down here to win.”

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Louisiana's top school board is making history, electing an all-female group of leaders for the first time in its 46-year existence. The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education chose three women for its 2021 leadership posts, in elections held Wednesday. Sandy Holloway, of Thibodaux, will remain as board president. Kira Orange Jones, of New Orleans, will become vice president in January. And Ashley Ellis, of Monroe, will serve as secretary-treasurer. The 11-member education board — with eight elected members and three appointees of the governor — oversees policy and finance decisions affecting more than 700,000 public school students. The panel touted its history-making officer slate in a statement. “I am encouraged to serve with two other amazing leaders on this all-women leadership team,\" Holloway said in the statement. \"I am looking forward to the exciting and valuable work ahead that we can all achieve together to further choice, accountability, and child-centered policies that support our students and families.”

The conditions will apply for 10 years, with the possibility of an equivalent extension, and will be overseen by an independent trustee. However, there may be some cracks. Fitbit's data silo means that Google's advertising business cannot directly access users' health information.

It could have been different. Chappell started asking colleagues back in August what consideration was being taken around pregnancy and breastfeeding. "Everyone's work was so full up that they sort of said: not yet," she says. "We've had to bide our time." As SGUL's Le Doare notes, in the early stages of the pandemic it was believed pregnant women weren't at higher risk, though subsequent data changed that assumption.
 While it's perhaps forgivable given the havoc of this year, medical science has long failed to include pregnant women in trials. "My understanding is that this is the problem generally with drug companies, the paucity of data creates all sorts of problems and women are advised not to take drugs that they can take and vice versa," Brearley says. "They're just not prioritised."
 Asked why she thinks that is, Brearley has a clear answer. "It's sex discrimination," she says, noting that drug companies treat men as the default. "Female bodies [...] particularly when they're doing something seen as unusual such as lactating or pregnancy, [are]seen as too complicated," she says. "It's just a subgroup, it's too complicated, it's not the norm – it's not seen as the norm to get pregnant and have kids."
 What could be done now? We need vaccines from tried and tested technologies to win backing and approval, and we need other treatments to be prioritised for groups who can't get vaccines, including pregnant women. Chappell points to the Valneva vaccine, which is a tried-and-tested inactivated technology due for regulator approval mid-2021 as well as neutralising antibodies, an expensive and experimental therapy to reduce negative Covid-19 outcomes. We need existing data, be it from animals or accidental pregnancies during trials, to be analysed and released with the speed and diligence of the overall trial data. We need to know when to expect that data, and what we're waiting on — two questions the MHRA could not answer, though such detail could help women make better choices. It may not be worth taking the risk of a jab now if safety data is due in a month, for example. And we need pharmaceuticals and regulators to stop treating pregnant and breastfeeding women as one and the same.
 None of that is asking too much, and none of it means pregnant women should necessarily take this vaccine. Pregnant women deserve what Chappell calls an "exit strategy" – because telling all pregnant women to stay home for the next two years doesn't work. "If you put them in a clinically vulnerable group, you need an exit strategy," says Chappell. "And that exit strategy should be equitable access to vaccine research."

IU would need not only a shift in momentum, but a shift in mentality, to overcome the Bulldogs in the Crossroads Classic in Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Hoosiers not only needed shot-making from Armaan Franklin in his most favored venue, but they needed the physicality of Race Thompson and Trayce Jackson-Davis on the low block defensively.
 In the second half of a 68-60 win, the Hoosiers (5-2) got all that they needed, on both ends, inside and out.
 “I thought Race really came in the second half, he was amped up and ready to go,” Jackson-Davis said. “Coach Miller told us at halftime, they weren’t here to mess around. We got back into it, and we started playing our ball.”
 Jackson-Davis finished with 21 points, eight rebounds, and five blocks in Saturday’s win. All five of those blocks came in the second half. Thompson, battling alongside, also had one of IU’s seven second-half swats, helping the Hoosiers lock down on the Bulldogs in their final non-conference game.
 Where the Hoosiers didn’t finish strong earlier this non-conference season in a loss at Florida State, this game was the opposite. Butler shot 14-of-26 in the first half, finding offense much too easy. During a 13-3 run to take a nine-point lead, the Bulldogs hit 6-of-7 from the floor.
 But the Hoosiers, trailing 37-32 at half, definitely finished. First, at the end of the first half, with a couple of free throws from Jackson-Davis and a late bucket from Al Durham to cut the deficit to five. Then IU came out of the locker room with its collective hair on fire, forcing Butler into 17 misses on its first 20 shots.
 IU’s blocks often led to easy runouts offensively, helping the Hoosiers to a 13-0 run and a 47-40 lead.
 IU had just one block at halftime.
 “It’s one of those things where you have to dig yourself out of it, and I thought we challenged ourselves,” Miller said. “I thought our guys were disappointed in the way we played, and in the second half we came out with a much better approach. Our attitude was much different.”

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) on Sunday strived to fend off the accusation that it had attempted to supplant Congress as the dominant partner in the United Democratic Front (IUML).
 IUML general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty said his party would not fall for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's ploy to create divisions in the UDF. The IUML had decided not to get drawn into the internal mechanics of the Congress. Moreover, it would restrict its view on the workings of alliance partners strictly within the confines of the UDF.
 In a Facebook post, IUML Malappuram district secretary Sadiq Ali Shihab Thangal said his party had always strived to keep the Congress in the front. It had never aspired to usurp the position of the Congress in the UDF.
 Meanwhile, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) vice president V.D. Satheeshan slammed Mr. Vijayan for "attempting" to stoke fear of Islam to open the door for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala.
 Mr. Vijayan was in lockstep with the aim of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to create a "Congress-rid" India. The Chief Minister had adapted a hard-right stance to attract the Hindu votes he had lost due to the government's intractable position on preserving the ancient traditions of the Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple.
 Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said Mr. Vijayan had said nothing new. The IUML had already assumed the dominant position in the UDF. It now aspired to control a weakened Congress in Kerala. He alleged that the Congress, CPI(M) and IUML had worked in tandem to single out and defeat BJP candidates in the local body polls.

Northwestern knew it would have to play close to a perfect game to beat No. 4 Ohio State in the Big Ten Championship Game on Saturday.
 The Wildcats played a near flawless first half and held the lead until late in the third quarter. But three-second half turnovers and more than 300 rushing from Trey Sermon proved to be their doom in a 22-10 loss to the Buckeyes.
 Northwestern accomplished many of the objectives they thought would lead to a victory over the 18.5-point favorite Ohio State, which had beaten them 52-3 last season.
 The defense held the Buckeyes and their offense averaging 46.6 points per game to just 6 points at the half and 13 after three quarters. They had harassed Justin Fields all day, sacking him three times as he completed less than 50% of his passes for just 114 yards and two interceptions – just the second multi-INT game of his career.
 Offensively, Peyton Ramsey played a nearly flawless first half as Northwestern led 10-6 at the break. The Wildcats, a second-half team all season, managed to get into the fourth quarter trailing by just three.
 But Ohio State outscored them 9-0 in the final period to pull away and post the win behind Sermon.
 “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” said a disappointed head coach Pat Fitzgerald after the game. “We had an opportunity and just didn’t get it done.”
 Ramsey finished 24-of-47 passing for 224 yards, and had several pinpoint throws on third downs to help the Wildcats move the chains. But he also had two interceptions and a fumble in the second half. Ramaud Chiakhiao-Bowman was Ramsey’s favorite target, catching eight passes for 103 yards, both career highs.
 Northwestern ran the ball better than expected, amassing 105 total yards, though just 28 of them after halftime. Cam Porter, often operating as a Wildcat quarterback, led the way with 16 carries for 61 yards and the lone Northwestern touchdown in the first quarter.
 While everyone wrote stories this week about containing Fields, the Big Ten’s offensive player of the year, it was Sermon, the grad transfer from Oklahoma, who was the difference for the Buckeyes. He ran 22 times for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the second half alone on his way to an all-time Ohio State single-game rushing record of 331 yards.
 “He’s a heck of a player,” said Fitzgerald, noting that he ran through a lot of tackles, often gouging the belly of the defense. But he also pointed out a lot of misfit gaps and “guys out of position,” uncharacteristic mistakes for a defense that was No. 6 in the nation against the run all season.
 As safety Brandon Joseph said about Sermon’s day, “That’s something that’s not supposed to happen around here.”
 Northwestern taking the fight to the Buckeyes wasn’t supposed to happen, either. The Wildcats had their best chances to grab hold of the game in the third quarter. Holding a slim 10-6 lead, the Wildcats had three possessions that failed to extend their lead.
 That stretch would come back to haunt them.
 On the first drive of the second half, the Wildcats converted a pair of third downs and got down to the Ohio State 9-yard line before Ramsey made his first mistake of the game, underthrowing a fade to John Raine that Justin Hilliard intercepted in the end zone.

Following the Dutch government's decision on Sunday to ban all passenger flights from the United Kingdom to the Netherlands to stop the spread of a mutated version of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the Dutch rail company NS and train operator Eurostar have announced that there will be no connection to London on Monday. Soon after the Dutch flight ban went into effect, the Belgian government decided to close its borders to travelers from the UK arriving by air and by rail starting at midnight on Monday, and Germany might soon follow suit.

The investigation is likely to look at the information used to get the warrant as well as the conduct of officers during the warrant. Chicago police sources who reviewed the footage told CNN the raid followed general training guidelines during warrant services where guns are expected. The first officers through the door cleared rooms while one placed handcuffs on the adults until the space was secure, which is normal procedure for gun warrants.

When Eileen Carroll's daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, Rhode Island health officials called with the results, then told her to notify anyone her daughter might have been around. Contact tracers, she was told, were simply too overwhelmed to do it. That's also why tracers didn't call to warn the family that it had been exposed in the first place, said Carroll, of Warwick, Rhode Island. Luckily, she said, the relative with COVID-19 they had been around at Thanksgiving already alerted them. “They said, ‘We have 500 people a day and we cannot keep up with this,'\" Carroll said. It's the same story across the U.S., as state and local health departments ask people who test positive to warn friends, family and co- workers themselves because a catastrophic surge in infections has made it difficult or impossible to keep up with the calls considered critical to controlling outbreaks. Health officials say do-it-yourself tracing is not ideal, but as infections and hospitalizations soar, it's likely the most effective way to reach people who may be at risk. Over 16.5 million people in the U.S. have been infected and more than 300,000 have died, and officials fear transmission will only get worse as people gather for the holidays. Some health departments aren't being informed of infections for several days, making it impossible to call at least 75% of a person's contacts within 24 hours of a positive test, which experts say is necessary to control outbreaks. What's more, many people won't pick up the phone or refuse to answer questions when tracers call. Sometimes, there are simply too many positive tests to call everyone. “If you don’t have the bandwidth to keep up, then you have to make strategic decisions ... and I think it’s a smart move,” Emily Gurley,...

Many believe that the Ford F-150 Raptor has untapped off-road potential. But while bigger tires and a suspension lift seem like the logical choice, this guy decided to turn his truck into a tank instead. This is the work of YouTuber Westen Champlin, the same guy who did a Cummins swap into the Ford Mustang. And while this isn't actually the first time a Raptor has been fitted with tank tracks, we feel like his low-budget take is just...

More importantly, most of those looking at the near-term economic impact of COVID-19 have warned that the full extent of the hit to payroll taxes wouldn't be visible until fiscal 2021. Bear in mind that pandemic-related lockdowns and layoffs didn't start until nearly halfway into the government's fiscal year. And despite a considerable amount of rehiring, many remain skeptical that payroll tax revenue will return to its pre-pandemic trajectory in the near future.

Beijing [China], December 20 (ANI): With the European Parliament (EP) passing a resolution on forced labour and the condition of the Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China's plans to have investment agreements with the European Union (EU) member states seem to be now under threat.   "Labour rights in China is a hot potato, particularly given the parliament's recent urgent resolution on Xinjiang. If there are no proper commitments on International Labour Organisation, then it will be extremely difficult," South China Morning Post quoted a source with knowledge of the thinking of both the EU Parliament and the European Commission, which conduct negotiations with China, as saying.   The EP on December 18 passed a resolution on forced labour and the condition of the Uyghurs in the XUAR while calling on the EU to proactively work towards an independent UN inquiry on China with a view to ensuring accountability for the crimes committed.   "The situation in Xinjiang, where more than 10 million Muslim Uyghurs and Kazakhs live, has rapidly deteriorated, particularly since the launch of the Chinese Government's 'Strike Hard against Violent Terrorism' campaign in 2014", said an EP resolution.  
 It added, "Uyghurs and other primarily Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been subjected to arbitrary detention, torture, egregious restrictions on religious practice and culture, and a digitalised surveillance system so pervasive that every aspect of daily life is monitored -- through facial recognition cameras, mobile phone scans, the large-scale illegal collection, aggregation and processing of personal data".   The resolution said there has been a general strengthening of the Chinese regime and a toughening of the treatment of minorities, in particular of Uyghurs, Tibetans and Mongolians, with the aim of assimilating them through the imposition of the Chinese majority lifestyle and communist ideology.   According to credible reports, more than one million people, are, or have been, detained in what are being called 'political re-education' centres, in the largest mass incarceration of an ethnic minority population in the world today.   The internment camp system in the XUAR is expanding, with more than 380 suspected detention facilities having been newly built or expanded since 2017, and at least 61 detention sites newly constructed or expanded between July 2019 and July 2020.   The EP observed that the Chinese authorities are systematically subjecting Uyghur women of childbearing age to forced abortions, intrauterine injections and sterilisation, with 80 per cent of all new intrauterine device (IUD) placements in China in 2018 performed in the Uyghur region, despite the fact that it makes up only 1.8 percent of China's population; whereas such measures to prevent births within the Uyghur population could meet the criteria for belonging to the worst crimes against humanity.
