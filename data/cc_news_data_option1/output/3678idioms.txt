ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Third countries might be invited to talks aimed at easing a dispute between Greece and Turkey over energy rights that has brought warships to the eastern Mediterranean, a top European Union official said Tuesday. Greece and Turkey have been involved in a standoff at sea for weeks over maritime boundaries between Turkey's coast, the ethnically divided island nation of Cyprus and several Greek islands. A Turkish research ship that has been operating in the area over which Greece claims exclusive rights has returned to port for maintenance, giving EU diplomats a window to launch negotiations between Greece and Turkey. EU member countries are also mulling sanctions against Turkey over its exploration. European Council President Charles Michel said while visiting Athens that he was hopeful a commitment for talks would be made soon and that a negotiating process involving several countries could help facilitate an agreement. "We are discussing the idea of a multilateral conference because, beyond bilateral dialogue, there is probably the need to bring the different countries to the table in order to deal with the different issues," Michel said. He did not elaborate. Germany, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency and launched an effort in July to broker direct Greek-Turkish negotiations, is a likely candidate to participate if the discussions are broadened.

West African leaders met the head of Mali's military junta on Tuesday to press for the return to civilian rule nearly a month after rebel officers seized power in the fragile state.
 The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) slapped sanctions on Mali after the putsch, including closing borders and a ban on trade and financial flows, and has called for elections within 12 months.
 The 15-nation bloc also gave the new military rulers until Tuesday to name a civilian president and prime minister to head a transition government.
 "My reason for this meeting is simple. We need to bring finality to our deliberations on Mali," Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo said in an opening statement at a lodge at Peduase, eastern Ghana.
 "That country can no longer afford any delay in putting a responsible government in place."
 Akufo-Addo, the current ECOWAS rotating chairman, reiterated that Tuesday was "supposed to be the day the military junta is supposed to put in place a government".
 "A closure should be brought to the matter now," he said.
 Junta leader Colonel Assimi Goita, who was appointed interim head of state, was attending the talks on his first trip abroad since seizure of power.
 He was set to deliver a speech behind closed doors to the assembled leaders from across the region outlining the putschist's plans.
 The military junta over the weekend backed an arrangement for an 18-month transition government, but this was rejected by Mali's popular opposition movement.
 Mali's neighbours, who are anxious to avoid the fragile Sahel state spiralling into chaos, have not yet reacted to the transition roadmap.
 Last month's coup -- Mali's fourth since gaining independence from France in 1960 -- came after months of protests stoked in part by Keita's failure to quell a jihadist insurgency that has plagued the country since 2012.
 The violence has since spread to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.

Former world number one Angelique Kerber fell to a straight sets defeat to Czech Katerina Siniakova in the Italian Open on Tuesday as Russian seventh seed Andrey Rublev eased through to the second round of the men's tournament.
 Three-time Grand Slam winner Kerber, seeded 15th in the Rome clay-court tournament being played behind closed doors at the Foro Italico, crashed out 6-3, 6-1 in 68 minutes.
 Siniakova, ranked 61, achieved her first win over the 32-year-old German in four meetings and next plays either Daria Kasatkina or Vera Zvonareva, with the two Russians playing later.
 Top women's seed Simona Halep opens against Italian wildcard Jasmine Paolini, with the Romanian warming up in the doubles on Tuesday, having skipped the US tournaments.
 The switch from hard court at the US Open to clay proved tricky for Kerber, who reached the fourth round at Flushing Meadows.
 The Rome tournament is a warm-up for the French Open on September 27, the only Grand Slam tournament which Kerber has not won.
 She paid for 23 unforced errors, twice as many as her Czech rival, although she saved three match points to hold serve in the second set.
 Elsewhere Czech 12th seed Marketa Vondrousova, last year's Roland Garros runner-up, dropped a set before seeing off Japan's Misaki Doi 6-1, 4-6, 6-4.
 In the men's event, US Open quarter-finalist Rublev, eased past Argentine qualifier Facundo Bagnis 6-4, 6-4 and next meets Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.
 Rublev hit 25 winners for his 20th match win of the season, winning two ATP Tour titles this year in Qatar and Adelaide before the season was suspended.
 Australian John Millman recovered from 2-4 down in the second set to overcome lucky loser Joao Sousa 7-5, 7-6 (7/2) and next meets Argentine Diego Schwartzman.

MONTGOMERY, Ala. (WSFA) - The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated the arts world. Across the country, stages and theaters remain empty as performing arts companies figure out how the show can go on while keeping its actors, staff and audiences safe.“The theatre industry is pretty much devastated at this moment,” said Alabama Shakespeare Festival Artistic Director Rick Dildine. The stage and the seats in the audience there have been empty since its last performance on March 14.“How they work, what we do is intimate. It’s close up, running backstage, a costume change, being in their dressing rooms, being in the rehearsal halls. It’s intimate stuff,” Dildine explained about the work it takes to put a production on the stage. The work is too intimate to continue right now, leaving many without jobs and a big hole in the economy.“There are over 47,000 people in Alabama alone that have jobs in the arts and culture. In Alabama alone, the arts and culture is a $4.8 billion contribution to the state’s GSP. And right now, a lot of folks are not working. They can’t do their craft. They are having to make terrible, terrible decisions,” said Dildine. “This past year, our peak payroll was 130. And we’re down to 20 right now. So we’ve had to furlough and lay off.”And now ASF is making some major adjustments.“We’re still making plans,” Dildine insisted. “We’re making plans with the unions, and we’re planning what we’re going to do programmatically. So right now for the next year, you can expect some online and outdoor programming.”In the meantime, Dildine is finding hope that even the worst of times can produce positive results.“It’s forced us to think creatively. It’s given us some time to plan big ideas,” Dildine said. “It’s brought forth new leaders in our organization, new energy. It’s got a, there’s definitely a can do spirit and a gusto of how we’re going to come out of this.”It’s not just local theaters feeling the pressure right now. Broadway is closed until 2021 and the Radio City Rockettes have cancelled their 2020 season for the first time since 1933.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News. All rights reserved.

It is expected that the cost will further fall to $100 by 2023, which will make the electric cars even more competitive in the long run.

The flexibility of the X-Engine can further be seen with the company’s development of various APU concepts for Army aircraft and land vehicles. The company entered into the xTechSearch competition with a high-efficiency aviation APU concept for rotorcraft. The proposed unit is compact, highly- efficient, and can perform the typical on-ground APU functions but also functions in-flight to offload the main engines in providing supplementary power for hydraulics, heating and cooling, and addresses the increasing power demands of the onboard electronics, weapons and other equipment. In APU applications, the X-Engine approaches the power density and packaging similar to a turbine-based APU, with the efficiency of a Diesel engine. Today’s APU’s are only 5-10% efficient, making them useful for only short periods on the ground. The LiquidPiston APU would offer substantial gains in power and efficiency and offload the main engines, allowing a helicopter substantial gains in range, or adding a passenger or other payload capability.

To them I say, look West, young fans, look West. The Southwest, to be exact, where the Dallas Stars have become my favorite team to watch across all of sports in the last few weeks. (OK, the second-favorite next to the green team that's actually from Boston).


  It starts with Khudobin, the lovable and affable goaltender who has stolen the show and is on the verge of stealing the Campbell Bowl from the Vegas Golden Knights heading into Monday's Game 5 of the Western Conference final. You watch the way he moves about the crease, attacks the puck at the top of the blue paint and grins every time he flips up his mask for a squirt of water; there's a joy to his game that makes you want to hop on board.


  Khudobin, 34, had two stints as the backup goalie in Boston, most recently for two seasons from 2016-18. He was the backup in Dallas, too, where he got a raise to spell big Ben Bishop. The Bruins opted to give that money to Jaroslav Halak, with the feeling the latter would be more equipped to spell the workload and push the buttons of starter Tuukka Rask.


  Yet in these bubble playoffs, the tables have turned. Rask left the Bruins to tend to a family emergency and while Halak was dynamite in beating Carolina in the first round, he was rather hapless against Tampa Bay in a five-game gentleman's sweep.


  Meanwhile out West, Bishop has been unfit to play with an undisclosed injury and Khudobin has done nothing but win, on the verge of putting his team in the Stanley Cup Final over a favored, wagon of a team from Vegas.


  For someone who thought the whole 'blame the goalie' narrative with the Bruins collapse was lazy, seeing another team win with its backup goalie is delicious. The Black-and-Gold were uninspired the entire time in Toronto; Rask wouldn't have saved their bacon the way they skated, and Halak was hung out to dry. Dallas, on the other hand, has proven that if a team commits to defense and plays with an air of togetherness and belief, its backup goalie can win.


  That the backup goalie in question happens to be a former Bruin just adds another layer of irony. That it's Khudobin, a guy who made tons of friends in his time in Boston and never seemed to have a bad day or a cross word for anyone, makes it fun.

  Has Roy Jones got a touch of nerves, a case of cold feet? Jones, speaking recently with Sky Sports, stated how "if anything, I made a mistake going in with him." The "him" in question is of course Mike Tyson, with whom 51 year old Jones will share a ring in November in a heavily hyped exhibition bout. Jones might be merely attempting to further the hype, or maybe he is genuinely concerned over what Tyson might do once the bell rings.

With yesterday's news that safety Devon Hunter will begin the year indefinitely suspended from the VT football program, the Hokies' once-loaded defense may take another unexpected step back.
 Given that Hunter's suspension follows an arrest (with a court date scheduled for November), it appears unlikely that he's available for the Hokies this Fall. If the allegations that led to his arrest - choking or strangling a female member of his household - prove to be founded, it's unlikely he ever wears Orange and Maroon again. Given that in his bail hearing, he seemed to admit that the action occurred and explain why he did it, that may ultimately prove to be the end of his tenure with the VT football program.
 The most important outcome here is that both Hunter and his alleged victim get the resolution (and likely counseling help for _both_ parties) needed to heal and move on from the event. That's true regardless of the outcome of any legal proceedings - and in some ways, may ultimately be unrelated to that outcome.
 This is a football website, though, so we discuss the football matters here.

FALL RIVER -- Sean Martin knows what it feels like to be a "non-essential" entrepreneur.


  "I was out of work for nine weeks," the professional barber said.


  It's been nearly three and a half months since he returned to cutting hair at his Whiskey & Steel Barbershop at 202 Bank St.


  "I signed the lease three days before I was allowed to open," in early June, he said.


  Martin, 31, was required to shut the site of his first barber shop business by March 24 after Gov. Baker issued his executive order stipulating that, until further notice, only "COVID-19 Essential Services" involving face-to- face interaction could be delivered -- as a means of minimizing the spread of the coronavirus.


  He says his wife during that time was laid off from her job as an esthetician performing skin treatments and facials.


  Martin says it's fortunate he qualified to collect unemployment payments as part of the federal CARES Act and its Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which was designed to help people who are self-employed, "gig workers"; and independent contractors.


  Martin is the latest tenant of a building that sits at the corner of Bank and Purchase streets and includes the Pink Bean coffee shop, the basement-level St. James Irish Pub and apartments upstairs.


  His shop directly faces the Tequila Lime Cantina restaurant and bar, which he says is a plus in terms of attracting new customers.


  During the previous three years he owned and operated a barbershop he called Buffington Barber Company out of the nearby Buffington Building at 10 Purchase St.


  Martin, who has a 4-year-old son, says his wife's grandfather helped them out by paying the rent on their Somerset apartment while they were out of work.


  "I wouldn't mind him paying a little longer," he joked. "But it's nice being back to work."


  His shop has just two chairs, the second of which Martin says will be used starting in November by barber and hair stylist Kaleigh Pinto.


  Only one customer for the time being is allowed inside, and appointments, which can be made in person or on the phone, are required, Martin said.

Werner said his first experience in the Premier League highlighted just how different it was to the Bundesliga.


  "I'm really excited, it was a tough game today, like everybody said to me before that Premier League football is something different," he said. "It was a hard game, before the 1-1 we played not so good in the second half and after the 1-1 we make it better.


  "Reece [James] scored an amazing goal and what brings us back into the game and at the end the corner decides the game so we are very happy that we win today, and hopefully that we win more games next time."


  After Jorginho converted the 23rd-minute penalty, Leandro Trossard equalised for Brighton in the second half.


  But James's stunner and a deflected Kurt Zouma strike saw Frank Lampard's side earn three points.


  Asked what made the Premier League different, Werner said there were several factors, including the physicality.


  "The game is totally different. In some situations we have a lot more space because the field is very big and you can make a lot of runs like we have in the first half after we lead 1-0," he said. "But when you come out of the cabin in the second half, the game was totally different, it changed completely and the other team, Brighton, done very well and gave us a lot of problems.


  "Of course the physicality and the strength of the defenders, I played against three massive defenders, you don't have something like that in Germany.


  "I'm happy to be here and I think it was a good first game for me and for the whole team."


  Chelsea will host Liverpool in its next game on Monday (AEST).
