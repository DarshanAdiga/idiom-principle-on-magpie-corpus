WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 500 of the active-duty troops brought in to help if needed with the civil unrest in the nation’s capitol have been given orders to leave Washington after a fourth day of largely peaceful protests, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy and other officials said Friday. But a number of other active-duty soldiers remain on alert in the region, prepared to respond if needed. The decision to send the troops home comes as D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has repeatedly complained about the growing contingent of National Guard troops in the city to help handle the protests,and has opposed any use of active-duty forces. According to McCarthy and other officials, about 350 soldiers from the 91st Military Police Battalion from Fort Drum, New York, about 30 members of the 16th Military Police Brigade from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and about 100 military police from Fort Riley, Kansas, were given verbal commands to go home. They are expected to leave Friday. The Army’s 3rd Infantry Regiment, which is normally most visible as the soldiers who stand at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, remains on alert just outside the city. The troops, known as the Old Guard, are based close to D.C. at Fort Myer, Virginia, and have been on 30-minute alert status. “The Old Guard still remains in support. It is our intention to try and turn that off as soon as possible. We’ve had four peaceful days in a row, projecting a fifth,” said McCarthy, adding that there have been enough National Guard personnel brought in to provide any needed support for the protests in Washington. More than 700 soldiers with the 82nd Airborne Division's immediate response battalion boarded buses on Thursday evening and were back at Fort Bragg overnight. They had been kept at military bases outside Washington. Their departure had been delayed a day,...

Reeltown High School social studies teacher Cindi Knox said she gives 110% every day to her students, which has obviously paid off as she was nominated her for a LifeChanger of the Year award.
 Knox was completely shocked by the announcement and had no idea until her daughter tagged her in a post on Facebook.
 “I was just completely blown away and honored,” Knox said. “I am very humbled. There are just so many deserving people out there. It’s just an honor to be thought of for a nomination.”
 LifeChanger is an annual program recognizing K-12 educators and school employees across the country who make a significant difference in the lives of students through positive influence and leadership.
 “She is a phenomenal lady,” Reeltown principal Tom Cochran said. “I’ve know Ms. Knox for 13 years and she is a stellar example of what LifeChanger of the Year is all about.”
 Cochran said Knox sacrifices for her students and co-workers endlessly and is always up to tackling new challenges.
 “There are countless examples I could give of her help throughout the years,” Cochran said. “She is an example of kindness and caring and sacrificially gives to those around her.”
 The anonymous nominator wrote, “When we look at devotion to one’s craft, love for students and sacrifice we don’t need to look any further than Ms. Cindi Knox. She has dedicated her life to serving students in Tallapoosa County and taken on various leadership roles with zeal.”
 Knox has been an educator for more than 30 years and been nominated before as Reeltown High School Teacher of the Year.
 On the LifeChanger website, others who know Knox also left words of encouragement.
 “Cindi is one of the most dedicated teachers at Reeltown,” Nancy McGhee said on the website. “She strives for perfection every day and expects the same from her students. If all teachers had her drive the world would be a better place. She is so worthy of this award.”
 Knox said her students become her children and she prides herself on becoming investing in their lives.
 “We care about what they do and the decisions they make,” Knox said. “At the same time, we can’t be their parents but we can guide them and love them. We’re a very close-knit community and love our kids.”
 As Knox teaches history, she feels it’s important for students to learn about the country and past events surrounding it.
 “I want them to be able to make judgments and decisions based on a background,” Knox said. “I want them to love our nation and I try to communicate that in my classroom.”
 Knox is also an academic advisor and acts as a liaison among teachers, students and parents to ensure students follow the correct paths and make solid choices.
 “I don’t want students to limit themselves and their futures,” she said.
 Knox has helped organize prom for many years, been a cheerleading advisor and taken on other roles within the school system to work closely with the students.
 “One of my granddaughters loved Ms. Knox class so much that it inspired her to become a history teacher,” Kathy Rodgers said on the LifeChanger website. “What a great example of what a teacher should be. Thank you Cindi Knox for your dedication.”
 At the end of the day, Knox doesn’t feel there is anything specific that makes her stand out and is proud of all the teachers she works with at Reeltown.
 “Every teacher up there does the same thing, so I don’t consider myself a standout,” Knox said. “Hopefully at some point I do help a kid here and there I don’t know who nominated me but thank you to whoever you are.”

 While Floridians were aware of the definitive start of hurricane season, we were unable to predict the arrival and significant impact that COVID-19 would have on our lives.
 Still coping with the effects of COVID-19, consumers are now preparing for a very different type of disaster. Hurricane season is expected to be active, with as many as six major hurricanes. We've already seen two named storms this season - Tropical Storm Arthur and Bertha.
 As the state's insurance consumer advocate, I am sensitive to consumers' anxiety and angst now more than ever. I am aware of the difficulty of preparing for a storm while in the midst of a pandemic. In response to a recent survey conducted by Get Ready, Florida!, 73% of respondents expressed concern about potential hurricanes this season; 51% said they are more concerned about hurricane season this year compared to last.
 I am also aware of the skepticism and decreased confidence that consumers may have in insurance companies. In the aftermath of Hurricane Michael, consumers shared passionate stories of resilience, struggle and frustration as they attempted to navigate the insurance claims process.
 The common concerns shared by consumers were the lack of communication or response from the insurance company; extensive, unnecessary delays; multiple company adjusters assigned; and unsatisfactory settlement offers.
 I've worked diligently with insurance companies to address these concerns; to ensure that improvements are implemented and that these claims handling delays do not occur in the future.
 Most recently, I've met with the top residential property insurance companies (by policy count) to discuss their disaster preparedness and response plans. I provided feedback and guidance to companies to ensure that consumers can have confidence that, if a disaster occurs, their claims will be handled efficiently and timely. I was pleased with the communication strategies and innovative techniques implemented in response to COVID-19; plans for disaster claims handling; and improvements made to address experienced delays.
 Floridians, disasters are inevitable. Tropical storms and hurricanes are an inescapable part of life in Florida. While the existence of a pandemic or hurricane is out of our control, you can take steps to ensure you're prepared to withstand the storm and recover as soon as possible. I implore you to take action now to successfully weather the storm.
 You have the power to protect yourself and your family, especially related to insurance. Take time now to review your insurance policy to determine if you're properly insured. Consider purchasing flood insurance; according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one inch of water can cause $25,000 worth of damage to a home.
 Your agent can walk you through your policy and provide guidance. Research and learn more about the insurance professionals involved in the claims process, your hurricane deductible and your rights. Inventory your home and write down important insurance contacts just in case you have to file a claim. Make improvements to your home to mitigate damage.
 Beware of fraudsters and unscrupulous vendors. Don't share your personal and insurance information with persons who contact you unsolicited. Be sure to understand all documents you sign.
 Following these few tips is a good start to preparing for a potential storm. You can find more tips, resources and information on how to prepare for a disaster at www.MyFloridaCFO.com/Division/ICA/PlanPrepareProtect.

ROMA (ITALPRESS) - Anche il calcio italiano dice sì alle cinque sostituzioni. Lo annuncia la Figc in una nota. Nella riunione del 20 maggio scorso, preso atto che, a causa della eccezionale situazione determinatasi in ragione della emergenza epidemiologica per Covid-19, l'Ifab ha approvato la proposta della Fifa di modificare temporaneamente il numero massimo di cambi consentiti nelle competizioni che saranno completate entro il 2020, il Consiglio Federale ha deliberato di autorizzare un massimo di cinque sostituzioni per ciascuna squadra nelle gare delle competizioni programmate fino al termine della stagione 2019/2020. Inoltre è stato deciso di prevedere che ogni squadra possa effettuare le suddette sostituzioni utilizzando al massimo tre interruzioni della gara, oltre all'intervallo previsto tra i due tempi di gioco, nonchè, nell'eventualità di disputa dei tempi supplementari, una quarta interruzione, oltre a quelle previste tra la fine dei tempi regolamentari e l'inizio del primo tempo supplementare e tra il primo e il secondo tempo supplementare, solo nel caso in cui al termine dei tempi regolamentari siano stati sostituiti meno di cinque calciatori/calciatrici. La Figc precisa che, laddove le due squadre effettuino una sostituzione nello stesso momento, questa verrà considerata un'interruzione della gara utilizzata per le sostituzioni da entrambe le squadre.

IndyCar opens its season delayed by the pandemic  with an all-in-one-day show Saturday on the fast, high-banked 1 ½-mile oval at Texas Motor Speedway, more than eight months after the 2019 finale. The 24 drivers will practice, qualify and race for the first time with new protective windscreens on the cars, all in a span of 9-10 hours in front of empty stands.
 “It’s going from a complete standstill to one of the fastest tracks on our schedule, so hopefully everybody has got their wits about them,” Ryan Hunter- Reay said. “It’s definitely an interesting scenario to go straight to Texas.”
 Texas was scheduled again to be the midpoint race of the season, the ninth of 17, with the Indianapolis 500 among the eight races before that and then eight more afterward. Only Indianapolis Motor Speedway has hosted IndyCar races longer than TMS, which has had races each year since opening in 1997, including the season finales from 1999-2004.
 Now Texas is the opener, with 200 laps instead of the usual 248, while the Indy 500 will be run Aug. 23 and there are three doubleheader weekends. Texas, Iowa and Laguna Seca in Monterrey, California, are the only tracks that kept their original dates, though second races were added to those other two venues.

BELTSVILLE, Md. (AP) — Better training for law enforcement. More money for historically black colleges and universities. Speaking to Americans with the “right tone.” Vice President Mike Pence got plenty of recommendations Friday as he met with community and faith leaders about how the nation should respond to the death of George Floyd. It was part of a Trump administration effort to show it is listening to Americans as protests continue throughout the country and as President Donald Trump places his emphasis on strength rather than empathy in dealing with the protests. Pence visited a church in the Maryland suburbs near Washington, D.C. “It will not be enough just for us to heal our economy. We’ve got to heal that which divides by breaking down barriers to opportunity for African Americans and any Americans left behind,” Pence told the group. “So, I’m anxious to gain your insight.” Pence also assured the group that “justice will be served” in Floyd’s death. Floyd died after a white officer jammed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes as other officers watched. Damian Cooke, a substance abuse counselor, said he worried that the event might just be a photo opportunity for the vice president but decided ultimately that a discussion about moving forward must be had. He said the nation in a sense is reaping what it sowed because black youth do not see the law as protecting them. “These kids are angry, and they are not sure exactly what to do with that anger, and actually what the endgame may be other than they want to be heard and they want justice and they want it today,” Cooke said.

TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albanian political parties on Friday reached a long-sought consensus on electoral reform aimed at guaranteeing free and fair elections and considered a key condition to start accession negotiations with the European Union. The new agreement focuses on the electronic identification of the voters, depoliticizing the election administration and other technicalities in line with recommendations from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which has monitored the post-communist country’s elections. Albania’s post-communist elections have continually been marred by irregularities, like vote buying or manipulation in baloot counting. After failing to conclude an agreement by the May 31 deadline that had been set by the political parties, two days of meetings of the main political actors were held at the residence of U.S. Ambassador Yuri Kim, facilitating the dialogue together with her EU and British counterparts. “They address a key condition to start EU accession negotiations, as stated in the Council conclusions of March 2020, thereby moving Albania one step closer to its EU future. This bodes well for future progress on reforms needed on Albania’s EU path,” said a joint statement of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi. In March Albania and North Macedonia were given the green light by the European Union to begin membership talks, though a starting date has yet to be set. A U.S. Embassy statement said, “This important milestone was reached because Albania’s leaders put their differences aside and worked to deliver a tangible result to the Albanian people.” The OSCE, which assisted in drafting the reform, urged...
