Kohli, smiling, replied, "This Test was very important from fitness point of view. If we talk about global fitness level, our fitness level is still low compared to other teams and we want to take it up, which is a basic requirement."
 The gruelling routine has two sets of cones that are 20 metres apart. Once the beep is sounded, the athlete has to reach the marker on the other side by the time the next beep sounds, turn and get back to where he started before the third beep.
 The frequency of the beeps gradually increases for the subsequent runs.
 Kohli, who is currently in the UAE for the ongoing 13th IPL, said even he has to clear the test to get selected for the India team.
 "I''m the one who goes to run first and this is the condition that if I fail that I am also not available for selection. It is important to set that culture and it will lead to improvement in overall fitness levels."
 The session was attended by sports persons such as Paralympic javelin gold medallist Devendra Jhajharia and woman footballer from Jammu and Kashmir Afshan Ashiq.
 Also present were actor, model and runner Milind Soman and nutritionist Rujuta Diwekar.
 Modi also interacted with Afshan, who hit the headlines in 2017 as a stone pelter in Srinagar.
 The 25-year-old played as goalkeeper in J&K; women's football team and later played in the Indian Women''s League in 2019 for FC Kolhapur City. She also trains youngsters in Srinagar.
 To encourage her Modi said, "You have done very well in football. Mostly, football fans say 'Bend it like Beckham', but now they will say 'Ace it like Afshan'."
 Afshan said she gets inspiration from former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, eulogised as "captain cool".
 "I do meditation at 5:30 every morning to keep my mind cool. I have learnt a lot from M S Dhoni, he is always calm. I like getting that calmness in my life, it helps to do all work calmly. It helps in balancing mental stress."
 Kohli said better fitness has helped the players, especially fast bowlers, to perform during crucial moments.
 "In Test cricket, sometimes we get tired. Our fast bowlers are best in the world currently and if they have to put that effort on the fourth and fifth day on the field, they can do it now," he said.
 "We always had the skills but when in the crucial moment when the body gets tired and the team needs you, our performance used to dip and our opponents used to win, now because of our fitness, we have been able to capitalise and perform on those crucial moments," he added.
 Kohli said he didn't follow the right diet early in his career and stressed on the need to bring an overall change in lifestyle.
 "When I started playing, I started having lot of things which were not good from health point of view. So physical fitness and diet had to change. Now life is very hectic, so if we don't keep fitness in sync with our times, we will keep falling behind. If we wouldn't have focussed on our fitness then we would have fallen behind in our sports as well.
 We can't only depend on our skills as mental strength depends on how fit is the body and mind."

 Modi said he was glad that healthy eating is becoming a part of people's way of living.
 "Becoming fit is not as difficult as most think. It just requires a little discipline. Fitness ki dose, aadha ghanta roz. Every Indian should play some game or do some fitness activity, be it tennis, badminton, kabaddi. It has to be for at least half an hour," the PM said.

Over the last few months, dozens of U.S. cities (and small towns) have been victimized by violent looters. Although the mainstream media have reported that these are mostly peaceful protests, the facts speak otherwise.
 Since the death of George Floyd, cities throughout America, including my hometown of Chicago, have been ravaged by radical anarchists who are using the so-called racial reckoning in the aftermath of Floyd’s death to wreak havoc.
 In August, after an unprovoked, violence-plagued looting spree in downtown Chicago — two months after George Floyd’s death — Mayor LoriLightfoot said, “What occurred downtown and in surrounding communities was abject criminal behavior, pure and simple. ... This was straight up an assault on our city.”

For several months, the Gunners have been closely linked with signing Atletico Madrid midfield enforcer Thomas Partey in an effort to add some much-needed steel and strength to their squad. More recently, though, Arsenal have started to be heavily linked with a move for Lyon and France ace Houssem Aouar, who would add a sense of creativity to the Gunners' options when attacking.
 However, as it has been documented throughout the summer, Arsenal need to first offload players and cut their cloth before launching a move for Partey or Aouar, with their valuations significantly higher than what the Gunners can currently afford.
 But in what appears to be a huge boost for Arsenal in their efforts to land Partey before the window closes, Atletico Madrid are keen to sign former Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye from French giants Paris Saint-Germain.
 According to a report by Culture PSG, the Ligue 1 club need to cut their cloth this summer and Gueye is seen as a player who could bring in significant funds.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — A top member of Poland’s conservative ruling party says the powerful party leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, is likely to formally join the government in order to end a governing crisis. The party's leader in parliament said all signs point to Kaczyński joining as a deputy prime minister who would have control over the Justice Ministry. The state news agency, PAP, had earlier reported that Kaczyński would join the Cabinet as head of a security committee that would supervise the ministries of justice, defense and internal affairs. Kaczyński served as prime minister from 2006 to 2007. However, since his party assumed power after for the second time in 2015, he has guided government decisions and appointments from behind the scenes.

Argentine Caballero is a competent keeper but, nearing 39, he’s not a realistic long-term choice between the sticks. That’s why the Blues were linked with Mendy, with Petr Cech – now Chelsea’s technical advisor – identifying Mendy as a potential recruit.
 Cech, of course, headed to Stamford Bridge from Rennes in the summer of 2004 – and was keen for Mendy to replicate that journey 16 years later.
 The 28-year-old was one of the main reasons why Rennes secured Champions League qualification for the first time in the club’s history, as he only conceded 24 goals in 28 games last season.
 France-born Mendy, who plays his international football for Senegal, had joined Rennes from Reims at the beginning of the 2019/20 campaign, having impressed the former with his performances for the latter.
 Remarkably, he only signed his first professional contract four years ago when he signed for Reims from Marseille.
 Mendy, the son of a Guinean-Bissau-born father and Senegalese mother, had started his career in the Le Havre academy before signing for lower-league side CS Municipaux Le Havre.
 It was there that he attracted the attention of AS Cherbourg, who snapped him up in 2011.
