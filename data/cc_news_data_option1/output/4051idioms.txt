Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

In the past, low-level possession or public order offenses were treated the same as any other criminal offense: the only recourse was to take the offender into custody and enter them in the criminal justice system. With Lincoln County LEAD®, the offender is assigned a navigator who develops an individualized service plan based upon a needs assessment.


  The navigator uses the service plan to create pathways for support and access to services that address the behaviors which cause criminal activity. Because participation in Lincoln County LEAD® is voluntary, it is only accessed via a mutual agreement between the offender, law enforcement officer and victim (for certain crimes).

Die geplante Charme-Offensive mit einer Freikartenaktion muss der DFB notgedrungen verschieben. Höchstens 300 Zuschauer dürfen wegen der angespannten Infektionslage beim Länderspiel-Test der deutschen Nationalmannschaft gegen die Türkei am Abend (20.45 Uhr/RTL) in das Kölner Stadion.


  Die Hoffnung des Verbandes, bis zu 9200 Fans in die 50.000 Plätze bietende Arena einzuladen und damit nach den Geisterspielen im September wieder für etwas Stimmung von den Rängen sorgen zu können, wurde vom Corona-Virus durchkreuzt. „Es ist sehr schade“, sagte DFB-Präsident Fritz Keller. Der 63-Jährige sprach aber von einer „richtigen Entscheidung“ der Verantwortlichen bei der Stadt Köln. Die Fan-Aktion soll nun möglichst bei einem der noch drei Heimspiele bis zum Jahresende nachgeholt werden.


  SPIELZIEL: Joachim Löw will das erste von drei Länderspielen innerhalb von sieben Tagen dazu nutzen, Akteuren aus der zweiten Reihe sowie den Neulingen im Kader eine Bewährungsmöglichkeit zu geben. Dem Bundestrainer passt das für den DFB finanziell wichtige Testspiel vor den Nations-League-Partien gegen die Ukraine und die Schweiz nicht wirklich in den Zeitplan bei der Weiterentwicklung der Mannschaft Richtung Europameisterschaft 2021. So verzichtet er gegen die Türken freiwillig auf den kompletten Bayern-Block. Und Löw bat die Fans daheim vorm Fernseher schon vorab um ein wenig Nachsicht. „Ich kann nicht erwarten, dass nach einer Trainingseinheit alles funktioniert.“ Trotzdem will er die „Sache positiv angehen“.

Hong Kong's performing arts community has been brutally hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which has left theatres empty and stage lights cold -- and there is little hope on the horizon even as entertainment venues begin to reopen.


  The same pain felt by performers in Broadway and the West End is being experienced by artists in Asia, even while governments there have had greater success at tackling the coronavirus.


  The region has had a much better track record of keeping down infections, but the often drastic social-distancing measures used to combat the virus have kept entertainment venues shuttered.


  In her cramped Hong Kong apartment that has served as a studio, stage and gym for the past six months, ballerina Irene Lo fastens her pointe shoes and effortlessly lifts one leg into a full split.


  "We're all missing the stage so much," she tells AFP.


  "I did zero shows so far and most of my teaching has been cancelled," said Lo, 42, who has multiple lead roles under her belt including Juliet in "Romeo and Juliet" and Clara in "The Nutcracker".


  She is currently missing out on the HK$20,000 ($2,500) per performance she would usually make before the virus hit, while video lessons bring in barely half of what she earned from in-person classes.


  Hong Kong bills itself as one of Asia's top performing arts cities, although its cultural dominance has been eclipsed in recent decades by the artistic rise of mainland China and South Korea.


  Artists and performers now complain that the city's government has provided little in the way of vital subsidies or support to keep their livelihoods going.


  While the recession-hit city has released billions in subsidies and job retention schemes, many performers are freelancers and are ineligible.


  "In the entertainment circle, there's no help at all," complained Rock Fang, a 42-year-old hip-hop dancer and teacher who says he has lost 80 percent of his income since the virus struck.


  He says his sole payout has been a one-off payment of HK$10,000 that all permanent residents received.


  Kitty Wong, 24, dreamt of the limelight after graduating from theatre school in May but currently works in a liquor shop to make ends meet.


  But she still practises at home, reciting by heart her favourite monologue from the play "Saint Joan".


  For now, all she can do is wait and hope audiences one day return to theatres.


  "I would say maybe it's not my time," she says. "So I will just wait until my time comes."

Lionel Messi put his Barcelona troubles behind him to fire Argentina to an opening 1-0 victory over Ecuador in World Cup qualifying on Thursday.


  The 33-year-old great has been in open conflict with his club but it had no detrimental effect on his form as his 13th minute penalty was the difference in a tight encounter.


  The six-time Ballon d'Or winner unsuccessfully tried to force his way out of the Catalan giants in the close season but he seemed much happier in the light blue and white jersey of his country.


  And Argentina needed him to be on top form in a bid to avoid slipping up at home to Ecuador for the second successive time in an opening World Cup qualifier having lost 2-0 to the same opponents four years ago.


  In the surreal atmosphere of an empty Bombonera -- the iconic stadium in Buenos Aires that is usually bouncing from the passion of fervent fans was left barren by coronavirus restrictions -- Argentina never looked in danger of another shock defeat.


  The hosts predictably dominated possession but struggled to break down an organized and physical Ecuador outfit that proved a different proposition to the one dispatched 6-1 in a friendly a year ago.


  The breakthrough came after a reckless challenge by Pervis Estupinan sent Lucas Ocampo sprawling in the box, with Messi stepping up to lash home his 71st international goal.


  Ocampos was presented with a glorious chance to double the lead early in the second half but goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez dived full length to keep out his low shot from eight yards.


  Rodrigo De Paul fired narrowly wide for the hosts with the last kick of the match.


  In Montevideo, Luis Suarez scored a record extending 60th international goal for Uruguay before substitute Maxi Gomez bagged an injury time winner against Chile.


  Atletico Madrid forward Suarez opened the scoring from the penalty spot on 39 minutes after Sebastian Vegas was harshly penalized for handball.


  Inter Milan's Alexis Sanchez equalised with a low shot on 54 minutes but Gomez had the last word with a stunning half-volley from 20 yards to complete the 2-1 win.


  It was honors even between Paraguay and Peru in Asuncion as Angel Romero for the hosts and Andre Carrillo both scored a brace.

Trump, who is eager to return to the campaign trail, said he wouldn’t participate if the debate wasn’t in person. Biden’s campaign then suggested the event be delayed a week until Oct. 22, which is when the third and final debate was already scheduled.


  Next, Trump countered again, agreeing to a debate on Oct. 22 — but only if face to face — and asking that a third contest be added on Oct. 29, just before the election. But Biden’s advisers rejected squaring off that late in the campaign.


  After the release late Thursday of a letter from Trump doctor Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley that the president had “completed his course of therapy” and could resume campaigning this weekend, the Trump campaign called on the commission to hold next week’s debate in person as originally scheduled.


  “There is therefore no medical reason why the Commission on Presidential Debates should shift the debate to a virtual setting, postpone it, or otherwise alter it in any way,” said Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien.


  But commission chair Frank Fahrenkopf said late Thursday that the decision to hold the debate virtually, guided by its medical advisers at the Cleveland Clinic, was not going to be reversed.


  The commission said it made the announcement in order to “protect the health and safety of all involved,” including the everyday citizens invited to ask questions of the candidates.


  The debate commission, which has the unenviable task of finding common ground between the competing campaigns, already came under scrutiny after the first debate between Trump and Biden deteriorated and the moderator unable to take control.


  The Oct. 22 debate in Nashville, Tennessee, is scheduled to feature a format similar to the first. Biden’s campaign has suggested that it be modified to the “town meeting” format, though the Trump campaign has not weighed in.


  Founded after the 1984 presidential election, the commission has organized every general election debate since 1988 — and typically selects the dates, moderators, formats and locations without input from the candidates.


  Biden moved quickly to make sure he would still appear in front of a television audience next week. Instead of debating Trump on Thursday, he will take part in a town hall sponsored by ABC News. As he campaigned in Arizona, Biden said he would indeed attend the Oct. 22 debate.


  “We agreed to three debates back in the summer,” Biden said. “I’m showing up. I’ll be there. And if, in fact, he shows up, fine. If he doesn’t, fine.”


  Trump is recovering from COVID-19 at the White House after spending three days in the hospital. In an interview with Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo shortly after the commission’s announcement, Trump insisted he was in “great shape” and called the idea of a virtual debate a “joke.”


  “I’m not going to do a virtual debate,” he declared.


  Stepien said Trump would stage a rally rather than debate next Thursday.


  With less than four weeks until Election Day and with millions of voters casting early ballots, pressure is building on Trump to turn around a campaign that is trailing Biden in polls nationally and in most battlegrounds, where the margin is narrower. A debate before an audience of tens of millions of television viewers could provide that reset.


  But another debate could also expose Trump to political risks. GOP strategists say the party’s support began eroding after his seething performance against Biden last week when he didn’t clearly denounce a white supremacist group.


  This would not be the first time Trump has skipped a debate. During the 2016 Republican primary, he boycotted the last debate before Iowa’s first-in-the nation caucuses, holding a fundraiser for veterans instead — a move he later speculated may have contributed to his loss in the state.


  Trump fell ill with the virus on Oct. 1, just 48 hours after sharing a stage with Biden in person during the first presidential debate in Cleveland. While the two candidates remained a dozen feet apart, Trump’s infection sparked health concerns for Biden and sent him to undergo multiple COVID-19 tests before returning to the campaign trail. His campaign announced Thursday that Biden had undergone his fifth such test and was found to be negative.


  Trump was still contagious with the virus when he was discharged from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Monday, but his doctor said Thursday he had “completed his course of therapy” and could resume campaigning this weekend. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 can be contagious for as many as — and should isolate for at least — 10 days.

Ordinarily, if a presidential candidate were to win the battleground state of Ohio by a fairly sizeable margin of 446,841 votes out of slightly more than 7.8 million cast, you might think that candidate and his political party in Ohio would be on very good terms.


  That margin of victory for Donald Trump is the largest for a GOP presidential candidate in Ohio since George H.W. Bush in 1988.


  Ohio Republicans should be dancing in the streets.


  There should be peace in the valley. The lion should lie down with the lamb. _Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah, Zip-a-Dee-ay; My, oh my, what a wonderful day!_


  Well, maybe not.


  This is Ohio, after all. And the Ohio Republican Party of which we speak.


  To say there is bad blood between the party hierarchy, headed by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, and the forces of President-elect Donald Trump in Ohio, would be a major understatement.


  That is why, on Friday in Columbus, 66 members of the Ohio Republican Party's central committee, its governing body, will meet to decide whether or not to boot out state party chairman Matt Borges.


  Borges was put in that office after Kasich was elected governor in 2010; and all he has done since then is run a state party organization that has done nothing but win statewide elections, with a nearly flawless record.


  Under ordinary circumstances, his party's central committee would be placing a laurel wreath on his brow and hailing him as a political genius.


  Instead, he has a Trump-backed challenger – Jane Timken, the vice chair of the Stark County Republican Party, taking him on for the chairmanship.


  What is going on here?


  The Trump forces say that Borges wasn't sufficiently enthusiastic about Trump's candidacy after Trump had bested Kasich for the GOP nomination.


  After a video surfaced during the campaign of Trump making vulgar comments about women in 2005, Borges was quoted as saying he wasn't sure who he would vote for in November; and told GOP candidates in Ohio they should feel free to withdraw their endorsements of Trump.


  One who did was U.S. Sen. Rob Portman of Terrace Park, who ended up winning his race for re-election by 21 percentage points.


  And, of course, Kasich never did endorse Trump. At the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich – the "host governor" of the event – never set foot in the convention hall; and for the rest of the campaign spent his time helping congressional candidates around the country raise money.


  Bob Paduchik, an old hand in Ohio politics, was tapped by Trump to run his Ohio campaign. Now, Paduchik has been rewarded for his work in Ohio with the number two position in the Republican National Committee.


  Last month, Paduchik sent e-mails to all 66 members of the central committee endorsing Timken and telling them that Trump's win in Ohio was made more difficult by Borges' "failure to support and defend our nominee."


  Borges has consistently said that the state party organization did everything it could to help the Trump campaign in Ohio.


  Saturday, Borges sent an e-mail to the 66 central committee members saying he had the support of a majority of them. And he attached a list of over 100 GOP leaders around the state who are not members of the committee - from Kasich on down to county commissioners and township trustees - who have endorsed him.


  Still, he is a state party chair being challenged.


  So who, then, is Jane Timken?


  She is a lawyer and the wife of Tim Timken, the CEO of TimkenSteel Corp. in Canton. She is also a Cincinnati native, a graduate of Walnut Hills High School.


  The "name" Timken is powerful in GOP circles in that part of the state. It is to northeast Ohio politics what the name Lindner has been to GOP fundraising in southwest Ohio.


  In fact, Paduchik said in his e-mail to central committee members that Jane Timken raised more than $1 million for the Trump campaign.


  Ann Becker of West Chester, a long-time tea party activist in Butler County and Cincinnati, was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Butler County; and she was elected to the state central committee for the first time in November.


  Friday's meeting will be her first as a central committee member.


  Becker said she will be supporting Timken.


  "I've talked to her and I think she understands the role of the party,'' Becker said. "She wants transparency in the party organization, which is something we have not always had. I think she would make a good chair.


  "I had a call from Matt Borges too,'' Becker said. "He is a kind man, always professional. But I really believe that the leadership of the state party hurt the (Trump) campaign."


  The party leadership, Becker said, often overlooks people who make up the grassroots base of the GOP.


  "Not just the tea party folks, but the evangelicals, the Second Amendment people,'' Becker said. "Everyone needs to be brought into the party. That's just good old-fashioned grassroots politics."


  The vote Friday will be a secret ballot; and committee members must attend in order to vote.


  "A lot of this is going to depend on who shows up,'' Becker said.


  Brittany Warner, communications director of the Ohio Republican Party, said that, as of Thursday, no committee member has told the party he or she can't attend.


  "The only thing that might change that is some bad weather,'' Warner said in an e-mail to WVXU. "But right now, all 66 are expected to attend."


  If so, that might be good news for Borges.


  He needs a simple majority – 34 votes – to retain the chairmanship.


  Warner said that "a majority of the members (34) have already committed to voting for him, in addition to others."


  Some of the Southwest Ohio central committee members are playing their cards close to the vest – they simply won't say what they will do.


  Former congressman Bob McEwen, a central committee member of the 7th Ohio Senate District, said he wants to talk with other central committee members before making up his mind. He said he particularly wants to talk to his fellow 7th District central committee member, former state representative Michelle Schneider.


  McEwen said he can understand arguments on both sides.


  "It depends on how you look at it,'' McEwen said. "If you are looking at it as a chairman who is good at getting Republicans elected, then Matt is second to none,'' McEwen said. "Or you can look at it recognizing that this is a time of change. And the new president has spoken out for a change in the Ohio Republican Party."


  Former Madeira mayor Mary Anne Christie, the honorary chairwoman of the Hamilton County GOP who served as a member of Electoral College from Ohio last month, is not saying how she will vote Friday.


  She did say she has been bombarded with pitches from both sides.


  "To me, this is just a terrible situation,'' Christie said. "I wish this would just go away. But it won't. I'm hoping there is some way the two sides can work this out for the central committee meeting."


  Working something out is the mission Hamilton County GOP chairman Alex Triantafilou has taken on for himself.


  He has been close to Borges and Kasich, but after Kasich failed to win the presidential nomination, he jumped into the Trump campaign with both feet – even though Trump ended up losing Hamilton County to Hillary Clinton.


  "I'm trying to work behind the scenes to see if there is any way we can work this out,'' Triantafilou told WVXU recently.


  Triantafilou said Borges is a friend, but said that Timken is impressive. Timken was in Cincinnati Dec. 4 for the "Victory Tour" rally Trump had at US Bank Arena, as well as a big-bucks fundraiser for the Republican National Committee at the Queen City Club that Trump attended before the rally.


  "Look, we are lucky we have such good people to run for this,'' Triantafilou said. "Still, I'd like to be able to work something out."


  That's quite a task. If Triantafilou were to be successful in being the peacemaker in this family fight, the president-elect might want to reconsider his nominee for Secretary of State.
