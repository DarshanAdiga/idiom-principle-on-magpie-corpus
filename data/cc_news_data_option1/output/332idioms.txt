The Accad method involved far riper grapes—not inherently a bad thing. But they were then dosed heavily with the preservative sulfur dioxide, often twice the typical amount, and soaked for as long as several weeks at low temperatures, to extract every last bit of flavor and tannin. This extended “cold soak” has become common, but Accad took it to extremes. He promised a deep, purplish wine, believing color an indicator of perfect development. The wine was then aged for years in mostly new oak, a familiar choice today but one usually balanced with second-use barrels.

I made a trip to northern West Virginia over the holidays. I had a great time visiting with friends and enjoying holiday events at the Museum of Ceramics and the Lou Holtz Upper Ohio Valley Hall of Fame in East Liverpool, Ohio; the Steubenville Nutcracker Village in Steubenville, Ohio; and the Hancock County Museum in New Cumberland, West Virginia.
 Following a concert at The Museum of Ceramics, my husband and I met a childhood friend and her brother for dinner in Calcutta, Ohio.
 “I have a gift for you,” my friend said, “something I’ve been saving for you.”
 The gift, presented in a Walmart plastic bag, was a scrapbook of recipes, household tips and inspirational messages compiled by the mother of my junior- high teacher. I learned the book was destined for the trash heap, until my friend rescued it knowing I was one of her few friends who would appreciate the collection.
 The scrapbook is contained within the pages of a Modern Plan Book supplied by the Kurtz Brothers, in Pittsburgh. They furnished school supplies and equipment to area schools in the 1960s and ’70s. The notation on the first page indicated the book was printed on good grade bond paper, providing a fine writing surface, assuring a serviceable book for the entire year’s plans.
 That may have been true, but, now, decades later, the pages are yellowed and tattered.
 And, yet, this gift is one that I will forever cherish.
 Vintage recipe collections are a great way to peek into the personal side of history. This was one woman’s personal collection with the past. The recipes are fun and fascinating to read. The recipes define an era. They were largely submitted by women who identified themselves by their husbands’ last names. There are only a few recipes by men.
 There are recipes for Lipton Onion Soup Dip, quivering desserts and salads made with Jell-O, meatballs cooked in grape jelly, celery stuffed with cream cheese, cocktail wieners wrapped in crescent rolls, and that famous award- winning Tunnel of Fudge cake that is baked in a Bundt pan.
 The recipes are a good example of how cooking methods have changed through the decades. There are a lot of recipes for canning and food preservation that would never pass USDA regulations today due to food safety issues. There are several recipes calling for raw eggs, something no longer recommended due to the risk of salmonella.
 The yellowed newspaper recipes reminded me of my childhood, when my mother proudly presented a strange dinner salad made with lemon Jell-O, canned sauerkraut and green onions, served with mayonnaise. The disgusting concoction evoked disrespectful grunts and comments from everyone at the dinner table.
 On another occasion, a mock apple pie recipe made with Ritz crackers caught my mother’s attention. Why someone would think replacing apples in a pie with crackers is a good idea stumped me, since we lived just a few miles from several large commercial orchards and apples were readily available. We were served lemon sauerkraut salad and mock apple pie only once.

I could now test the circuits through the relays using a multi meter set to ohms testing on the under side where the relay connections were soldered in. I quickly found the failed relay, no circuit through the switching side of the relay, to remove the relay was another matter, trying to melt out the solder to free the relay proved difficult but with patience the relay was removed. The relay itself had to be modified as in the spade connectors were too wide and had to be cut down at the edges of the connectors to get the relay to fit into its position, it was a simple matter then to re-solder the connectors to the board. The circuit board was put back into its position and bolts used to secure it in place of the rivets, the cover was refitted and the whole package put back onto the car. Then came the moment of truth, I switched on the ignition and was greeted with numbers on the odometer and the theft light working as it should, I cranked and engine and was happy to hear it fire up.

MORGANTOWN -- London, England, native Dan Stratford did not want to come to the United States 16 years ago, but fast-forward to the present day and he sure is glad he changed his mind.
 Stratford, a former West Virginia University soccer player who won two NCAA Division II national championships as the head coach at the University of Charleston, was introduced as the new man in charge of the Mountaineer men's team on Saturday morning at the WVU Coliseum in Morgantown.
 "We started this about a month ago when the opening became available," WVU director of athletics Shane Lyons said. "We indicated that we were going to do a national search, and we had the opportunity to do that. Throughout that search, one name kept coming to the top -- and that was Dan Stratford. He's 155 miles away. We looked at people 2 to 3,000 miles away, but the guy closest home had the ability to do that -- come back home to West Virginia University.
 The new WVU coach said he was asked early in 2004 if he had any interest in coming to play soccer in the United States, and at the time he didn't. A few months later he had been talked into giving the U.S. a try and landed in Morgantown as a freshman that fall. He played for West Virginia from 2004 through 2007, serving as a captain in his final season and helping lead the Mountaineers to three NCAA tournament appearances during his time as a player. Stratford played professionally in both the United States and Europe, with stops in Major League Soccer and the Scottish Premier League, before returning to WVU as an assistant coach for Marlon LeBlanc in 2011.
 "The connection I have and the affinity I have for this place, my core values, my philosophy, the environment I want to create it all stems from my time here as a player,” Statford said.
 Startford left Morgantown to become an assistant at UC in 2013, and when former Golden Eagles coach Chris Grassie was hired by Marshall in 2016 Stratford was tabbed as his replacement.
 During his time at Charleston, Stratford led the Golden Eagles to a 61-4-5 record in three seasons. His UC teams won the 2017 and 2019 Division II national titles.
 "Chris [Grassie] was a visionary for what the model needed to look like at UC," Stratford said. “It was good for me to leave the nest, to leave WVU and grow. I played for Marlon [LeBlanc], I coached with Marlon and obviously have a lot of gratitude for what he has done for me over the years as well."
