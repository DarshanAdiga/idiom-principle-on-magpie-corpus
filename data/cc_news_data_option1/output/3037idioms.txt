Before signing Cam Newton to a one-year deal worth up to $7.5 million, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick wanted to do his homework on the veteran quarterback.
 The Patriots were familiar with the 31-year-old who has played nine seasons in the NFL. In fact, Newton has beaten Belichick's New England teams the two times they've faced one another. This summer, however, the Patriots coach wanted to learn more about the eccentric former NFL MVP.
 On Friday, Belichick spoke to the local media for the first time since April. He revealed that the Pats did a lot of homework on Newton. That included meeting with the quarterback and talking to people who knew him to see if he would be a fit for New England.
 As it turns out, the reports on Newton were all positive and Belichick seemed eager to get the veteran into training camp, which starts on Saturday with a ramp-up period of strength and conditioning.
 "Things worked out," Belichick said. "We spent quite a bit of time with Cam. He spent quite a bit of time with us. I think it was a mutual interest.
 "We spent quite a bit of [time with] a number of different people and a number of different conversations just trying to see how the fit would be. It was very positive on our end and I'm glad it worked out."
 For the first time in Belichick's career in New England, the coach heads into the summer with a true quarterback competition after Tom Brady signed with Tampa Bay in free agency. You'd have to go back to 1992 (the year before Drew Bledsoe was drafted) to find a time druing which there was any uncertainty in camp as to who would start at quarterback for the Patriots. That year saw four quarterbacks start -- Hugh Millen, Scott Zolak, Tom Hodson and Jeff Carlson.
 Now, the Patriots head into camp with four quarterbacks -- Newton, Jarrett Stidham, Brian Hoyer and Brian Lewerke. Unlike most offseasons, the Patriots' coaching staff hasn't seen any of these players throw the ball. In the past, there would have been organized team activities, or OTAs, and minicamp -- totaling about 10 practices -- for players to get a feel for the playbook and to get to know their teammates. Because of the pandemic, those practices were canceled and players engaged only in virtual meetings.
 Newton signed with the Pats after the virtual meetings ended, but that hasn't stopped him from playing catch-up. Newton has worked out with several Patriots players in California. In New England, Newton had a workout with receivers Julian Edelman, N'Keal Harry, Jakobi Meyers, Damiere Byrd and Gunner Olszewski. He's also worked out with Mohamed Sanu and Devin Asiasi.
 Of course, Stidham still has a chance in this competition. He had a solid summer last year when he beat out Hoyer for the top backup job. When he was asked if it was hard to judge how much Stidham has developed, Belichick said that all players are truly in the same boat.
 "Everybody missed those. That's what it is. It's the same for everybody," Belichick said. "That's the way it went this year and that's the way it went in 2011 [during the lockout]. Some years are different than other years. There's nothing we can do about that. We can't change it. We just try to make the most out of every opportunity we get going forward. That's all we can do."
 When it comes to scouting the quarterbacks on the roster, the Patriots won't have games to judge their play since the preseason has been canceled. When he was asked how that will change things for the Patriots and analyzing their own players, Belichick said it'll be like college, where teams practice and hold scrimmages up until their first games.
 Belichick made it clear that he wouldn't comment too much on the quarterback competition. When he was asked if the team would change its offensive playbook to fit a certain quarterback's style, the coach said the Patriots will do what they've always done since 2000 -- teach all players the "certain fundamentals and basics in our offensive, defensive and special teams systems that need to be taught."
 As it pertains to the quarterback competition, the Patriots coach says it's simple.
 "That spot is the same as all the other spots on the team. We have a long way to go and we'll see how things turn out.
 "I can't control how players perform. That's up to them. We'll give everybody an opportunity and see what happens."

In terms of the operational results I think is a great quarter for the company. You can see here in the fourth bullet point we produced just under 220,000 ounces of gold and just over 19 million pounds of copper. There was an excellent level of gold production and copper production and you can see that really resonates in the bullet points below where if I reference the last bullet point our own sustaining cost company-wide was very competitive $804 per ounce. You can see in parenthesis there each of our operations were each producing gold lower than an [indiscernible] sustaining cost of $700 per ounce. So at Kumtor $692 per ounce and Mount Milligan $679 per ounce at Öksüt very low cost at $537 per ounce. So albeit Öksüt still in its sort of initial ramp up phase that already is presenting as one of our lowest cost operations in our portfolio. So obviously in terms of prevailing gold price environment this makes for a very high margin business.

People looking for a holiday have been avoiding areas experiencing “hotspots” or surges in COVID-19 cases, and they’re not flying or taking cruises; instead, they are taking ATV vacations, Lusk stated.
 Tourists coming to Mercer County and McDowell County for the Hatfield-McCoy Trail spend most of their time ATV riding, and they’re less likely to find themselves in a crowd.
 “It’s easy to social distance,” Lusk said. “There’s no forced interaction with anyone except the folks you came with. It really does fit the bill for a social-distancing vacation. You really don’t have to interact with anyone while you’re here.”
 As of late July, attendance on the trail has been good.
 “We had a very strong June. We calculate our permits from November to November, so we won’t know the total number until then,” Lusk said. “It looks like we’ve recovered 60 to 70 percent of what we lost because of the shutdown. We were down for two months, but when we opened, the permits (sales) were very strong.”
 Bruce Sizemore of the Black Oak ATV Resort in Rock said his reservations have been good ever since the ATV trails reopened. His business has grown every year since he opened, and he wondered how his numbers would have looked this year if the trails had not closed.

With upticks in positive COVID-19 testing rates linked to larger social events, Gov. Charlie Baker said Thursday that his administration is reviewing the state's guidance on gathering sizes, but blamed the behavior of people choosing to party without precaution for the clusters of infections that have sprung up.
 A large party in Chatham has been linked to a cluster of new infections there, while a number of lifeguards who attended a party in Falmouth walked away infected by COVID-19. And on Nantucket, officials are considering scaling back restaurant hours as infection numbers on the island have ticked up and people have been observed gathering on beaches close to one another without masks.
 "I think that's one of the things we're talking about," Baker said at a press conference when asked about the state's gathering size limits. "But the bigger issue is not so much the nature of the size of some of these gatherings, especially the private ones that are going on in backyards and places like that. The bigger issue is honestly the behavior generally at those, which is not socially distant, no masks and in some respects a lack of respect for how this virus works and how it moves from person to person."
 Baker's assesment of the situation echoed that of frustrated Cape Cod officials, who pointed Thursday to house parties and other private gatherings as a driver of new COVID-19 infections in the region. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo also told her constituents to tone down the summer partying as she took action to reduce permissable gathering sizes in the Ocean State.
 "To all our residents I can't express this enough. Don't be careless or complacent," Baker said.
 The state's guidance instructs people to limit indoor gatherings to 25 people, and a maximum of 100 people outdoors depending on the size of the venue. The state's positive test rate is at 2 percent currently, which is still low, but has been rising slightly over the past week or so.
 Baker was at Pfizer's facilities in Andover where the pharmaceutical giant this week entered stage three efficacy trials for a vaccine for COVID-19 that is expected to involve up to 30,000 test patients. Pfizer is one of several Massachusetts companies chasing a vaccine, and company officials hope to be able to file for regulatory approvals for use by October.
 The company said it expects to produce 100 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year, and will have the capability to make 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Pfizer's is an mRNA vaccine that requires two doses per patient. Cambridge-based Moderna has also begun widespread testing of its vaccine on humans, and another vaccine candidate linked with Massachusetts, this one being pursued by Johnson & Johnson with researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, has shown potential in a study with monkeys, and is entering an early-stage clinical trial in people.
 "Until we have a treatment or a vaccine, and I know you're working on that one, we have to learn how to continue to live with this virus," Baker said, with Pfizer executives standing nearby.
 Vaira Harik of the Barnstable County Department of Human Services said on a call with members of Cape Cod's reopening task force on Thursday that it was "irresponsible" to host or attend a group gathering without physical distancing and masks, whether the event is indoors or outdoors.
 "If you can hear the frustration in our voices, you are not mishearing this," Harik said.
 Thirteen people tested positive for COVID-19 in connection with a house party earlier this month in Chatham, Board of Selectmen chair Shareen Davis said. The Cape Cod Times reported Monday that eight Falmouth lifeguards had also tested positive after attending a party.
 Davis called it "reckless and dangerous" to ignore public health guidance and said officials wanted to impress upon young people "that their actions have impact" and they could spread the highly contagious virus to loved ones who may be at higher risk.
 Sen. Julian Cyr, a Truro Democrat, said holding parties where people don't wear masks or keep their distance is "profoundly disrespectful to Cape Codders who have been working very hard and done, broadly, a pretty good job to slow community spread."
 "There's evidence that the community spread is limited, so we're talking about private events, which admittedly is frustrating, particularly given the fact that there is ample fresh air and sunlight and breezes on Cape Cod," Cyr said. "It's frustrating to see these private events occurring, particularly if they're occurring indoors. Private events at which physical distancing and mask-wearing are not occurring are the clear accelerant that is spreading the virus on Cape Cod."
 Cyr said he can relate to the desire to socialize and suggested visiting with friends outdoors, in chairs spaced apart from one another.
 In Rhode Island, Gov. Raimondo dropped the maximum gathering size from 25 to 15 after what officials there have described as a slight uptick in cases. In a Wednesday press conference, the governor said an analysis of more than 4,000 COVID-19 cases reported in Rhode Island made one thing "crystal clear."
 "We're partying too much," she said.
 Raimondo said her state has traced cases back to a house party with more than 50 people, birthday parties in backyards and restaurants, a baby shower, a sports banquet and large pool parties. The patterns are the same, she said -- more than 25 people gathering in close contact for hours, with no masks or social distancing.
 "If you're doing this, I need you to knock it off, because people are getting sick, people are dying, and it's unnecessary," Raimondo said. "Yes, it's summer, I know you want to have a good time -- we all do -- but I have friends now whose loved ones are on ventilators. Your right to have a party should not infringe on their right to live."
 Stricter rules for anyone traveling from the majority of states outside New England to Massachusetts take effect on Saturday. People arriving from 42 states will need to either self-isolate for 14 days or provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within the previous 72 hours, or risk fines. The rules apply to those moving in to university campuses for the fall semester, and some colleges will have their own testing protocols in place.
 Cyr said the ability to return to campus might incentivize college students to behave responsibly in the remaining weeks of their summer breaks.
 "That fun summer night on Cape Cod may actually have some pretty significant consequences for you not being able to attend classes in person, being stuck at home with whoever your parents are for a long, cold academically remote winter," he said.
 Baker said the uptick in cases on the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket -- popular summer vacation destinations -- were part of the reason he put more teeth behind the state's inbound travel restrictions.
 The Massachusetts governor paused his discussion of the coronavirus at Thursday's press conference to caution people not to plant mysterious seeds from packages that have been arriving unsolicited from foreign countries and may contain invasive species harmful to the environment.
 "Locusts? What's next?" the governor muttered, almost to himself.

“I think he was a little calmer,” White Sox manager Rick Renteria said. “After the first hit he was much more relaxed. When you get to the big leagues, one of the things you want to do is get that one out of the way.”
 The Royals had high hopes Jakob Junis would get their pitching back on track. He was recalled along with batterymate Cam Gallagher earlier in the day to make his season debut. Both players had been cleared after testing positive for COVID-19 and building up their stamina at the club's alternate training site in Kansas City, Kansas.
 Junis and Gallagher worked well together through 4 1/3 innings, surrendering just two runs and six hits.
 It was the bullpen that let Kansas City down.
 Tyler Zuber walked three while recording just two outs. Barlow then allowed the go-ahead runs in the seventh when Greg Holland was unable to get him out of the two-on, no-out jam. Holland proceeded to allow two more of his own volition, then Glenn Sparkman threw the ball away on an easy grounder for an error that let two more runs score.
 KICK SAVE AND A BEAUTY
 Junis helped himself in the second when he deflected a liner by Eloy Jiménez off his foot to Maikel Franco at third base. The ball never hit the ground, so Franco caught it for an out and fired to first base to double off Edwin Encarnación.
 “Looking back on it, it was pretty dumb honestly,” Junis said. “The shift was working perfectly right where he hit it. One of those things where I just reacted. I don’t know if I’ve ever reacted by putting my foot out like that. I kicked it up perfectly and it was a pretty cool play all-in-all but not the smartest one.”

But in their simplicity, these little creatures have a profound message. As a business adviser, when I mention leadership lessons from a squirrel, clients give me the eyeball roll. And then, that changes. Let's have a look.
 1\. Genius isn't mutually exclusive to, well, geniuses. It's available for everyone, maybe even squirrels. I don't think squirrels read about genius in "Power vs. Force" by David Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D., but it certainly looks that way. If you've yet to read it, Hawkins spells out the essential message in advance. "The individual human mind is like a computer terminal connected to a giant database. The database is human consciousness itself, of which our own cognizance is merely an individual expression, but with its roots in the common consciousness of all mankind. This database is the realm of genius; because to be human is to participate in the database, everyone, by virtue of his birth, has access to genius." OK. So, a squirrel isn't a human, but you have to admit, they may have access to the genius databank because no baffle will stop them. In fact, they never tire of engineering creative solutions to outwit us, not merely to survive, but to thrive. Isn't tireless creativity in the face of challenges, no matter what, a core tenet of leadership?
 2\. Ingenuity is the new success. On a scale of one to ten, a squirrel is at 157 for ingenuity, crossing the street, not so much. Seriously though, consider this. Does the squirrel face a problem and say, "Ah skip it, I surrender?" Do they blog about problems? Do they hang out on social media sites and join the "Sky is falling crowd"? Do they outsource their thinking? From what's left in our feeders, it doesn't look that way. Perhaps it's the will to survive that drives ingenuity, because a squirrel will figure out a way through, around, over or under an obstacle. Maybe the squirrel knows finding solutions requires using a different energy than a problem. To constantly focus upon, talk about and fixate on a problem, neurologically cements you to it. Yet when you fully connect to the database, you possess an unobstructed mindset to funnel energy towards solutions unreachable from obsessing over a problem. And isn't transforming a negative situation, regardless of what it is, into a positive one, for a comeback or to propel a business forward a hallmark of leadership?
 Leadership lessons from a squirrel may be a stretch, or is it? What leader wouldn't love an unhindered connection to the genius database, ingenuity and an unwavering commitment to finding solutions. You might say, we could learn from squirrels, just not how to cross the street.

President Donald Trump tweeted about delaying the November election, and in the process, launched an attack on whether anyone should trust the results when the votes are tallied.
 President Donald Trump is in a tight spot, behind in national polls and barely ahead in Texas, where no Democrat has won a presidential race since 1976. When he said the other day that “nobody likes me,” nobody disagreed with him.
 His situation sets the environment for Republicans and Democrats up and down the November ballot in Texas. If the Republican president does well, that’s probably to the benefit of other Republicans on the ballot, even if the state doesn’t have straight-ticket voting anymore. If he does poorly, it could spell a good day for the Democrats. And in an election where a half dozen seats in Congress and the Republican majority in the Texas House are at stake, the top candidate’s performance is critical.
 On Thursday morning, the president retreated to his safe space — Twitter — where he ruminated on the impending election that could make him the first one-term president in almost three decades.
 “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most innacurate and fraudulent election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote?,” Trump tweeted.
 That sent a shudder through the political world. Democrats predictably started hacking away — or continued hacking away — at Trump. But Republicans, who’ve been very cautious about creating any distance between themselves and a president with strong support from their party’s voters, made room for themselves this time.
 You can’t delay an election with a tweet, and you can’t delay one from the White House, either. That’s not what this is about. Trump is feeding doubts about the reliability and trustworthiness of U.S. elections, leaning on urban legends about the frequency of voter fraud — yes, it exists, and no, it’s not pervasive. Those doubts support the notion that any election that doesn’t reelect the incumbent is illegitimate.
 But doubts like that don’t start and stop with the presidential race. Everybody on the ballot — winners and losers — agrees to accept the results when they enter the contest.
 Trump isn’t proposing to get rid of mail ballots. He casts them himself. He’s making a false distinction between absentee ballots, which are cast in the mail, and universal voting by mail, which is a version of the same process, with different rules about who is eligible.
 But this is clearly a threat to the system we use to choose the people who represent us. Want to knock over a building? Destroy the foundation. Want to tear down a democracy? Destroy confidence in free elections.
 It’s disquieting when the kooky stuff in politics comes straight from the top.
 There are always people like U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Tyler, who thrive on flagrant nonsense and outlandish skylarking; he’s the congressman who speculated that wearing a mask is what infected him with COVID-19. But he’s also just one of 535 members of Congress, and hardly the only one saying strange things all the time.
 But the system almost always sorts seeds from stems on the way to the top. The 2016 election, starting in the Republican primary, didn’t do that. One refrain from that contest — that here, finally, was a candidate who wasn’t afraid to burn it all down — was dead on.
 The voters who wanted to kick the establishment aren’t upset about the president’s tweeting.
 The voters who thought any Republican at all would be better than Hillary Clinton kicked their problems down the road and now confront the consequence.
 If Trump were to lose the general election while successfully planting widespread doubts about the results, he’d be leaving the country in shambles for his successor — and for anyone elected to Congress or a state legislature in what could then be framed as a shady election that put illegitimate officials in place.
 If he’s not winning, nobody’s winning. He’s willing to risk the whole establishment of government to prove it.
 That’s not a new story in history, but it’s new to us.

If you are a parent of school-age children, or if you ever were, you know that question is burning inside every High Desert family household. The straightforward answer is it depends on who you ask.
   
 Victor Valley Union High School District virtually heads back to school Monday. Apple Valley Unified follows on Wednesday, Hesperia Unified on Thursday and Victor Elementary trails on Aug. 17.
   
 None of the elected board members or highly paid superintendents of any of our local districts decided what the return would look like. Gov. Gavin Newsom decided for them.
   
 School closures -- and the indecision about how, when and what school will look like when it returns -- has wreaked havoc on California education. Some private schools have seen a spike in requested admissions, while many small, private, religious-based schools have shuttered due to funding issues.
   
 Many Catholic schools are growing enrollment and expect to return to the classroom sooner than most. Tuition is an issue for private-school parents, many of whom are not wealthy, just picky.
   
 The CDC has been all over the map in recommending return-to-school guidelines. First, they were too harsh. Now many fear, because of political pressure, the institute's new guidelines are too loose.
   
 If you take the time to compare the evolving sets of guidelines, the basic safety elements have not changed that much. What's different is the CDC's new "tone" when it describes the health and economic downside of keeping kids away from the classroom.
   
 The specific recommendations about how classrooms should be laid out, social distancing and keeping smaller groups stationary while moving the teachers has remained the same. Masks are mandated. It is an expensive set of guidelines to implement. That has not changed and is another reason school districts are not pushing to return.
   
 According to recent polling, 60 to 71% of parents surveyed prefer schools wait to restart on-campus attendance until infection risk is reduced. What that reduction looks like is a moving target defined in several different ways.
   
 A reported threshold being used by big cities like New York and Chicago is a 5% positivity rate among those tested in their area.
   
 Right now, counties in Florida and Nevada have positivity rates four times that target. In San Bernardino County, the positivity rate is 13%.
   
 Another on-going question, subject to all the usual conspiracy theories, is can we trust these numbers being reported by our county's Public Health Department?
   
 The science and testing, according to the CDC, seem reasonably clear that children under 10 who are without serious underlying conditions, are at low risk of becoming severely ill or dying from COVID-19. The unknown is how effective they are at spreading the virus to others. Middle and high school students may be at a higher risk, recent data show.
   
 So it is settled. Virtual learning is the order of the day for now. Newsom's "rule" is that your "area," -- we assume he means San Bernardino County in our case -- must drop below the 5% positivity rate for two consecutive weeks before the state will consider a request from the sounty Health Department to review any request to return to the classroom from a school district. Then, how long it would take to start up classroom cleaning, bus schedules, some possible COVID-construction requirements, who knows?
   
 Remote learning has issues. In the High Desert, a strong WiFi signal is a gift of nature. The most obvious hurdle, though, is for those parents who must still go to a job every day.
   
 Remote learning takes in-home leadership and someone to keep the students on task and on time. This is tough for an 8- or 10-year-old, and almost impossible for a 14-year-old -- none of whom can be left home alone by law.
   
 Delivering a free laptop is not the end of the process. We know already from recent experience last spring that English-language learners have a big hurdle when learning remotely.
   
 Try as they might, what is the school district's answer for special needs and special education students? Most of these types of classes require individual lesson plans and attention to specific learning and behavioral needs of each student. Quality special education is not likely to occur in a Zoom meeting. Programs for these students are also mandated by law, and parents are attuned to carefully monitor so their students gets what they need from the school district.
   
 Suffice to say, teacher union demands and the state fully funding all school districts based on last year's average daily attendance means there is little financial pressure to return to the classroom from the educational establishment in the 2020-21 school year.
   
 If I was a forward-looking state school superintendent, I may consider a "COVID disability retirement" package for teachers who are into their senior years or have a serious underlying condition. It would make more sense for them to be on disability retirement than to take a chance and return.
   
 How the overwhelming future deficit will impact teacher retention, benefits, retirements and school funding is a discussion for another day -- and a future state budget battle.
   
 For now, let us all work together to get this under control. Let us take pity on the parents that must retrain their children to wear shoes, pants and eat with utensils again, and help get our schools open -- for their sake.
