Environmental groups plan to appeal to Washington Gov. Jay Inslee for a rule dictating when the state can shoot wolves to protect livestock, an attorney for one of the organizations said Friday, shortly after the Fish and Wildlife Commission declined to write one.
 The commission unanimously accepted a staff recommendation to deny the request. Wildlife managers need leeway in deciding whether to shoot wolves as a last resort, Fish and Wildlife wolf policy leader Donny Martorello said.
 State law lets the petitioners push the request to the governor.
 "I think that has been our intention all along," said Sophia Ressler, attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of four groups that filed the petition.
 "We hope we can show him and make him understand how vital it is to have enforceable rules in Washington," she said.
 Fish and Wildlife says shooting wolves falls under its authority to handle dangerous wildlife.
 A protocol that guides the department emerged from its Wolf Advisory Group in 2017. The protocol was developed outside normal rule-writing channels and does not bind the department to take action.
 Wolf advocates and environmental groups are challenging the protocol in court, claiming it should have gone through a formal scientific and public review. Lawsuits are pending in King and Thurston counties. A ruling is expected soon in King County.
 Martorello said the advisory group, which includes conservation groups, was a better forum to work out ongoing conflicting views over wolf management than a one-time rule-writing process.
 None of the four organizations that submitted the petition are on the advisory group. Cascadia Wildlands, Western Watersheds Project and WildEarth Guardians are the other petitioners.
 They proposed a rule that would place new requirements on ranchers and range- riders to prevent attacks on livestock.
 Martorello said the proposal would be too costly and some requirements, such as relocating cattle, would be beyond the department's expertise and authority.
 "Livestock husbandry is not really in our wheelhouse," he said. "We simply don't have legal authority to move someone's personal property."
 Ressler said the department's concerns could be worked out as the rule was written. "We were proposing rules that started a process," she said.
 Fish and Wildlife has authority to remove wolves in the eastern one-third of Washington. In the rest of the state, wolves are federally protected.

Unlike Felker, he’d been a New Yorker from the beginning. Born in the Bronx on June 26, 1929, he was a public-school kid of the stickball generation, the son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary. After graduating from Cooper Union, Glaser first made a splash as part of a small confederation of illustrators called Push Pin Studios. There, along with his art-school friends Edward Sorel, Seymour Chwast, and Reynold Ruffins — all of whom are still active — they were at the leading edge of their field, as the taste in illustration for magazines and ads changed from a brushy, painting-driven realism to a curvy, bright, cartoony approach. Maybe it was because they had come of age with comic books; maybe it was just more purely American, New Yorky, ethnic, what-have-you.

Dave Derrico, who guided Canon-McMillan High School to the girls soccer state championship in 2016, resigned Thursday night as the Big Macs’ head coach.
 Derrico spent more than 20 years coaching in the Canon-McMillan program, including the last 18 as the varsity head coach. He had a 215-121-21 career record and coached the Big Macs to a pair of PIAA title game appearances. The Big Macs made the final in 2014.
 “Dave was a state champion coach who will be missed by the players and school district,” said Canon-McMillan athletic director Frank Vulcano. “He gave a lot of his time to make our program one of the top girls soccer programs in the state.”

And in those years, he made still another prescient call. In the mid-1980s, Steve Hindy and Tom Potter, the founders of a new microbrewery, came to him for a logo design. Glaser took a look at their proposed name — Brooklyn Eagle, recalling the defunct newspaper — and, as he told the story, he offered one key bit of advice. “Anheuser-Busch already has the eagle,” he told them. “You’ve got Brooklyn. That’s enough!” Brooklyn Brewery, with its swoopy baseball-jersey logo evoking both the departed Dodgers and a swirl of beer foam, made its debut in 1988. Because it was a startup without much money, Glaser took a stake in the company instead of a fee. Today, Brooklyn Brewery is a huge global brand — and, as Glaser told me a couple of years ago, that was the thing that made him financially independent, enough to keep him in taxicabs and then some, enthusiastically sketching, for the rest of his life. “Of all the work I’ve done!” he said, chuckling, in that inimitable voice.

Kids are fighting for their lives in hospital rooms every day. Their days often change dramatically. It’s in those situations that kids often feel isolated or alone. But volunteers with the Children's Cancer Association (CCA), also known as mentors, help offset that by bringing a little joy. Typically volunteers spend time with their kids, also known as Chemo Pals, in person. They play games and visit with one another to help take their mind off all the hospital time.

Texas is the largest of seven states that require an excuse to cast absentee (mail) ballots but exempt seniors from the requirement. The others (Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) are all deep- red states that generally frown upon liberalized voting rules, but predictably will cut corners for the over-65 voters who have in recent years leaned Republican. Texas Democrats’ argument, if accepted, would strike all those accommodations down or expand them to include all voters.

Kansas City Mavericks president and general manager Brent Thiessen has a new responsibility this season.
   
 Thiessen, who has been with the team since its inception in 2009, has been elected to serve as the chairman of the ECHL Board of Governors following the annual league meetings in Princeton, N.J., recently.
   
 He replaces Cincinnati Cyclones owner/president/CFO Ray Harris, who served in the role since the 2015-16 season.
   
 "It's an honor to be named chairman of the board by my peers," Thiessen said by phone Wednesday afternoon. "I want to thank Ray Harris for his past five years of service in the role. I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to assist and have a hand in making the ECHL the strongest league it can be."
   
 Thiessen oversees the day-to-day operations of the front office and hockey operations departments for the Mavericks. Following the 2016-17 season, he received the ECHLExecutive of the Year award.
   
 "I believe the ECHL is headed in the right direction, and we are all excited about the prospects for the upcoming season," he added. "The landscape of all professional sports teams has changed with the COVID-19 pandemic, but I, along with other members of the Board of Governors, believe we will start playing hockey in October, and I am very excited about what the Mavericks will do this season - both on and off the ice."
   
 The Mavericks will head into the 2020-21 campaign with a new head coach in Tad O'Had, the former associate head coach of the Florida Everblades.
   
 O'Had was in Independence recently and he, along with assistant coach Kohl Schulz, worked with Thiessen and other members of the staff plotting out a successful course for the Mavericks after the end of last season was wiped out by the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "Tad is dynamic, a guy who is detail oriented and a coach who has enjoyed a lot of success," Thiessen said. "I think once our players and fans meet him, they are going to find out right away why we selected him as our new head coach."
   
 The Mavericks are scheduled to open the 2020-21 regular season against the Tulsa Oilers at 7:05 p.m. Oct. 17 at the newly named Cable Dahmer Arena.
   
 "I guess we all have to use the word tentative now when we're talking about anything in the future," Thiessen said, "but we fully plan on getting on the ice the first week of October and plan on having a sell out for our home opener on the 17th."
