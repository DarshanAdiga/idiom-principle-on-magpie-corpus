He spoke by phone about what's happening.
 "I've been doing musical things that I always meant to get around to do," he said. "I am stuck in that [music] rut."
 Which, translated briefly, means that he's been combing through old recordings that he's made with different configurations of musicians, and releasing them digitally at no cost to listeners.
 One of those is "Memoirs of an Opening Act," a series of live tunes Travis did with Steve Shook, many of them from the 1970s, when they went on the road opening shows for George Carlin.
 The 14-song collection includes the part-rock, part-doo-wop, part-chamber music "Let's Go to the Museum," the beautiful and dreamy "She's Still All I've Got," and an unusually swinging cover of Quiet Riot's "Cum on Feel the Noize."
 Putting these unreleased tracks out was Travis' idea, and he pulled off the project with no input from Shook, who lives not far from him in Brewster.
 "We're still close friends, and once in a while we'll get together to do a benefit," said Travis, "but he chose not to listen to this record.
 "You have to understand," he added, "that the least thing Travis and Shook ever wanted to do was put out a live album. We almost always played as a duo, and what we thought we were doing was waiting to find the right pieces to form a band - mainly finding the right drummer. We eventually did, but it took us a long time."

 Told that Shook's song "She's Still All I've Got" is an absolutely lovely ballad, Travis was uncharacteristically silent for a moment, then said, "Steve's writing, and the way he plays chords, to me, was completely revolutionary, and still sounds completely different from anyone else. There were such different impulses in Travis, Shook. Part of it was just trying to stay alive and not get yelled at as an opening act, and then there was me being a ham who hated dead air onstage. So, I'd be doing whatever I had to do to keep people amused. We learned which things we could fall back on and be fine with, but the stuff I loved the most was Steve's songwriting. I probably wrote a little more than him, but I don't think my batting average was as good as Steve's."
 So, why, for the time being, has he stopped writing?
 "It's been by design," he said. "What I was planning to do this spring was work on a mountain of material I've got from a bunch of songs I've written. Probably four or five albums worth - trying to get that is shape enough to release properly. Part of my problem is horn overdubs. I have some songs that are pretty much done except for the horn overdubs, but I can't get three horn players in a room to do that now. Between the Catbirds, the Philharmonic, the Three-O, and my solo stuff, I had an obscene amount of material I was working on. So, I was actually trying not to write more."
 Then he started releasing the music he's been finding. Along with "Memoirs of an Opening Act," there's a Website feature he calls "Song of the Weak." One batch of those includes eight Beatles covers he and his different bands have recorded, a re-issue of the 1992 Incredible Casuals release "Live, Drunk, and Out of Tune" (Yes, another Travis band), and compilations of older songs by two of his singer-songwriter friends - one by Paulette Humanbeing and one by Pete LaBonne.
 Not to worry, Travis is still keeping his creative juices flowing.
 "I've been getting into making videos," he said. "I'm directing and editing them, and the newest one, 'Settling for Less,' was mostly shot by my girlfriend Belinda. It's been fun fooling around with that, and they're all on my YouTube channel."
 The best part of all of this is that Travis is letting everybody hear and see it for free.
 "It's all on my Website chandlertravis.com," he said. "But you can buy it, too. You can go to bandcamp.com or to my Website. With the free music, we always encourage people to make donations, and they have! We've made little bits of dough."
 "Memoirs of an Opening Act" and lots of other Chandler Travis-related music can be found at www.chandlertravis.com.

“We’ve structured all of those times as such so that it’s a very tight schedule. It’s voluntary. If they don’t want to come, they don’t have to come. But they have a set time, because we have to be cognizant of all the NBA, state health and CDC guidelines with regard to the rules that are in place.
 “I don’t think it’s the end-all, be-all to be back in the facility right now. I didn’t think that on May 8, I don’t think that right now. Our guys all over the place have been very committed to staying a week away from their best shape. We’ve had constant conversations with that. It is great that they’re able to be back, and I think they like it, and I think maybe more than anything is that you have the strength equipment. You don’t have limited strength equipment, you have everything you could possibly need from a strength and conditioning standpoint. That’s probably the best benefit. But the way that it is, you’ve got somebody behind those guys, as they’re lifting, ready to clean it up right after they’re done. It’s amazing, the work. I certainly should single out Jason McKenna, who runs our facility, and (director of performance) Phil Coles and (athletic trainer) Art Horne and all the work they’ve done on preparing that facility to be the safest place you could possibly work out.”
 Stevens and the Celts are still waiting on the definitive return structure, but, in whatever form the resumption of the 2019-20 season takes, the NBA will be housed in some type of “bubble” on the Disney property near Orlando.

This seems absolutely right to me. Resistance may turn out to be futile in the sense that it brings about no lasting change or improvement in conditions, though we hope that it will. Often, as Shelby says a few lines later on, discretion is the better part of valour, both morally and prudentially. But sometimes people just have to stand up to affirm their status as human beings. And when they do the rest of us have to stand with them, and we deny their value, and demean our own if we turn our backs. This is why the many acts of resistance and protest by black Americans and those standing with them are so deeply moving and significant, however this ends.

The move led to calls of an alternative to saliva from current and former players including India premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah. "So in cricket, you have the surface that you can play around with and bring about a balance between the bat and ball," said Kumble at a FICCI webinar.The bowlers will miss using saliva the most in Test cricket as it aids them in generating both conventional and reverse swing."...you can still probably leave grass on the surface or even have two spinners, let's get spinners back in the game in a Test because one day game or a T20 you are not really worried about shining the ball. It's Test match that we are talking about," said the former India captain."And in a Test match why not get two spinners to play in Australia, two in England, which doesn't happen often."Like he had said right after recommending the saliva ban as an interim measure, Kumble reiterated that allowing the use of artificial substances would have taken the creativity out of the game."We can probably use some other substance on the ball. All these years we have been very, very stringent on what to use on or what not to use on the ball," he said."We've been very strict about substances that have been used on the ball. That was something that we felt, the creativity was something that we should not (tinker with)," he said.Kumble, however, admitted that it would be hard for players to adjust to not using saliva."Although it is second nature in cricket, and that's something that players will find it hard to manage. And that''s why I believe that at training, they'd like to start slowly because it's not just about coming back and playing cricket in a match," he said."It's also about coming back from two and a half months of being locked up... And especially if you're a bowler, you need to have those bowling overs under your belt before you start competing."So, it's important that you slowly and gradually come back into sort of normalcy that you can and the advantage that cricket has over other sports is that there''s an element of adjustable variance in the pitch, which not many sport have," he added.Kumble said the committee's recommendations focused on resumption of cricket at the earliest."... I know there's been a lot of debate about shining the ball but the idea was to kickstart cricket, play the sport, and then I'm sure things will fall in place. Yes, there will be some challenges. You have to go one game at a time."We've given just broad guidelines from the ICC to the various boards because each country has its own challenges and within the country itself you see in India, you know, for example, Maharashtra has its own challenges, Karnataka is different, etc."Talking about the proposed Test series between England and West Indies next month, Kumble said gaining match fitness won't be easy for the players who have been out of action for more than two months."The players will have to have some sort of a cushion, some sort of a backup in terms of loading up the body to be able to sustain Test match because bowling 30 overs for a bowler is not going to be easy and even for a batsman, you know, the muscles that you use when you're batting is totally different."...in a match situation, you know, you're doing everything at the split of a second and then you're not training for those, especially in a home condition."So, you need to fill it up and probably have a few friendly games before you get into an important Test match."Kumble said one way of managing players' workload in the current situation is treating them as a group which is making a comeback from injury."That's all you need to look at the entire squad now saying okay, they've all been injured for the last three months, they are now coming back into training," he said."So, you need to slowly load them up and then start building their skill levels ...I think it's mostly confidence. Once the players are out and training, it comes back very quickly," he added.",

Global Cathodic Protection Market is valued approximately USD 4450 million in 2018 and is anticipated to grow with a healthy growth rate of more than 6.2% over the forecast period 2019-2026. The Cathodic protection is referred to a technique precisely used to control the corrosion of a metal surface by developing it as the cathode of an electrochemical cell. The Cathodic protection market is primarily driven by surging construction of both residential and commercial spaces, favorable government regulations for corrosion protection, escalating infrastructural demands in developed and developing countries and escalating need and utility in the power sector. The surging construction sector is acting as a key driver towards the demand and adoption of cathodic protection as it reduces the impact of corrosion in the construction materials. For instance: According to International Construction Market Survey, the growth rate of construction industry globally in 2017 was estimated nearly 3.5% and it grew to 3.9% (approx.) in 2018. In addition, as per the annual report of European Construction Industry Federation (FIEC) in 2017, it is clearly stated that construction activity in entire Europe grew by 2.2% in 2016 (reaching approximately 1,278 billion Euro) compared to 2015. Similarly, in 2017, a similar increase is forecasted (more than 2%) followed by increase of 3% in 2018 resulting into positively influencing the development and growth of cathodic protection market. However, high fragmented market structure and availability of substitutes impedes the growth of the market over the forecast period of 2019-2026.

Anne and Kurt Frustol’s children attended Hillcrest Lutheran Academy and, in their son’s senior year eight years ago, the couple made the move to Fergus Falls from New Jersey. On Friday, May 29, they opened a new business in downtown, an ice cream shop named Uncle Eddie’s.
 “Our kids went to Hillcrest and we moved out my son’s senior year and just wanted … (to) try to live somewhere else, we’ve always lived on the East Coast and we love Minnesota, we’re very happy here,” Anne says. Since then, Anne’s parents and Kurt’s
 whole family have moved to Minnesota. In fact, Uncle Eddie’s is named after Anne’s father, Ed Jensen.
 Jensen moved to Fergus Falls in 2014, two years after Anne and Kurt, and quickly made many friends in the community. Unfortunately, Jensen passed away in January 2015. “He loved to visit with people and enjoy a cup of coffee and ice cream, he just loved that fellowship,” Anne says. “We wanted to honor his name and open up something in honor of him, that’s where Uncle Eddie’s got the name.”
 The shop had a very successful opening weekend with an almost complete sellout. “We went through 108 tubs the first weekend,” Anne says. Though they were already back to fully stocked by Tuesday, as they learn what the most popular flavors are in the community they’ll be better prepared with backup tubs.
 The shop offers 40 different flavors of ice cream, as well as coffee and soda. “We’re starting simple, we’re starting with just ice cream and coffee and soda. Eventually, we might have a little more, some candy wall or something like that,” Anne says. The ice cream comes from a distributor and is primarily Kemps from Rochester, Land O’Lakes from Arden Hills, Pride Dairy from Bottineau, North Dakota and Cedar Crest from Cedarburg, Wisconsin. Some popular flavors over the weekend were cotton candy, bubble gum, birthday cake and strawberry rhubarb. Gina Nordlund, the day supervisor for the shop, said she thinks monster cookie might be another community favorite, while Anne recommends people try jolted cow, an espresso-based ice cream with brownie chunks.
 Anne and Kurt were lucky to not have to push their grand opening due to the pandemic. “We worked on it through COVID, just renovating,” she says. “We’re still finishing things but we were able to open last Friday night, we passed our inspections and were able to open. It’s currently just for takeout only and we can have outdoor seating, so we do have a deck on the back with some tables and then some benches in the front. Eventually, we’ll have tables and chairs on the inside.”
 The pair still work their other jobs, too. Anne is a full-time public health nurse and Kurt is a carpenter by trade. “We renovated the building completely ourselves at night and weekends, it used to be the Sherwin Williams paint store,” she says.
 Uncle Eddie’s is open every day from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. and is located in downtown Fergus Falls at 217 W. Lincoln Ave., between The Bric and City Cafe and Bakery.

Dear Dave,   Is it okay to combine finances with someone and start working on a budget before you marry them? I just got engaged, and we've been talking about the idea of getting a head start on our finances together.   Autumn
 Dear Autumn,   First, congratulations! I hope you two will have long and happy lives together. Now comes the hard part. But you asked for my opinion, so here goes.   No, it's not a good idea to combine finances with anyone you're not married to. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you two are thinking about your finances and your future - and I'd never wish anything bad for you - but all kinds of things can happen before you become husband and wife. What if you spend time paying off his debt, or vice versa, then the relationship doesn't work out?   However, this doesn't mean you can't begin working together on budgets for the future, and planning and dreaming about the goals you have together. The thing to keep in mind is you'll both need to be operating in full transparency mode to make it happen. He should know all about your income and debts, and you should know all about his. Along the way, you two need to have serious, regular discussions about saving, spending and debt to ensure you're completely on the same page with your finances before the big day.   There you go. My advice is both of you should pay only your own bills until after you're married. And remember, once that happens there's no yours and his anymore - it all becomes ours.   Dave
 Self-insure long-term care needs?
 Dear Dave,   I've been researching long-term care policies. Can you reach a point financially where you can self-insure long-term care needs, and not buy a long-term care insurance policy?   Paul
 Dear Paul,   It's possible, mathematically speaking, if you have the resources available to pay for the care you'd receive in a nursing home or similar facility for about 20 years. Not many folks have that kind of money, though. I think it's a large enough bill that it makes sense to transfer the risk to a long-term care insurance policy.   Keep in mind, too, if you're married you have to think about your spouse, and make sure they have enough to live on comfortably at the same time. That's a lot of money. And that's why I advise virtually everyone to put good, long- term care coverage in place at age 59 or 60. It can mean the difference between living with dignity, or having to depend on the government!   Dave

NEWLAND — Avery County Schools will be moving to a traditional school calendar, as decided on by the Board of Education during a meeting on Thursday, May 28.
 After some discussion sorting through the holidays and remote days included in the new calendar, the board approved the school system’s implementation of a traditional calendar for the 2020-2021 school year. The adoption of the new calendar became a necessity after new state laws ruled out the possibility for ACS to implement its innovative calendar.
 Much of the discussion came after board member Pat Edwards made the suggestion to ensure that students had Martin Luther King Day off. Students will also receive Good Friday off as a holiday. Under the new calendar, the school year will begin on August 17.
 “We always note in Avery County that [school days] are subject to change because we go with the best information we have right now, and we know that we will have to sometimes re-adjust as the year goes on,” Board Chair John Greene said.
 The honor of Avery County Schools Teacher of the Year was unveiled during the meeting, as Superintendent Dr. Dan Brigman wasted little time commemorating Molly Rhoades for achieving the honor.
 “It is an honor and a privilege to recognize one of the finest that I’ve seen, and they are all outstanding educators, but we’re going to recognize Ms. Molly Rhoades. Congratulations to you for being selected among your peers for being selected as Avery County School System’s Teacher of the Year for 2020,” Brigman said.
 Rhoades teaches English language arts and social studies to fourth- and fifth- grade students at Banner Elk Elementary School. Rhoades was selected from other teachers qualifying around the district.
 Teachers recognized as top teachers at individual schools within the system included Phoebe Fisher (Riverside Elementary), Kim Duncan (Avery Middle), Diana Love (Cranberry Middle), Brian Huskins (Crossnore Elementary), Marti Berry (Freedom Trail Elementary), Sharayah Webb (Newland Elementary) and Shelby Barrier (Avery High School).
 “She blew the committee away in terms of the evidence that she has presented to the committee for her passion for education, personalized instruction and kids loving her,” Brigman said.
 Brigman also presented two awards to recognize Child Nutrition Director Tammy Woodie and Transportation Director Brian King for the worked they performed distributing meals across the county during the statewide shutdown of public instruction that began on March 14.
 “At no time did I hear either one of these individuals say, ‘I can’t do that,’ or ‘I don’t think we should do that.’ It was, ‘How can we make this happen?’” Brigman said.
 The Avery County Schools system completed its distributed feeding program for the school year on June 2 and its instructional program concluded on May 27. The system will pick up its summer feedings program via pick-up service available at Newland Elementary School beginning June 1.

Some will jump to previous statements about leaving United. However, Pogba hasn’t ever come out and explicitly stated his desire is to walk away from Old Trafford. Last summer he spoke about perhaps needing a new challenge and in August admitted he didn’t know what the future would hold.
 He said: “Obviously there have been things said but only time will tell. This question mark remains. However, as I said, I am here in Manchester. I enjoy playing with my teammates and I always want to win every game. I always give it everything.”
 These musings, responses to questions asked, are hardly relationship-ending declarations of intent. Pogba was being honest.
 Make no mistake, the French star could’ve spent the last two years posturing and playing to the army of reporters who cover his every move, both on the pitch and off it.

"The Bible says, Jesus says very clearly, ‘you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ This is the supreme law of God. To love God and to love our neighbor. The supreme law of God. And to illustrate that, Jesus told the parable of the Good Samaritan. That’s what’s inside that Bible. That’s the teachings of the Christian tradition. That’s what the church stands for. To stand in front of it and not represent those values – values of love, and justice, and compassion, and human decency – is to violate a basic principle of the Christian faith itself, represented by that Bible, and represented by that church. And that’s part of what the Bishop of Washington was getting at."

"Yeah, I think it's all not gone according to plan by any stretch of the imagination," said Rossi, driver of the No. 27 Andretti Autosport Honda. "I don't think anyone saw this coming and really no one had a contingency plan for it, because why would you. I think the series has done everything right so far, and it's an impossible situation, but ultimately once we kind of moved on from St. Pete, it became clear that this was a much bigger thing than just us and IndyCar racing and sports in general, and there was something that everyone needed to take some time away and kind of reset.
 "It's given me a huge amount of appreciation for what we get to do every week, and ultimately I think leaving Texas it's going to give us a huge appreciation for the fans. We're going to get to go there and do what we love and go back to work, but it's going to be very surreal."
 The 200-lap race (shortened from 248) will be in front of empty grandstands due to safety concerns, with drivers and teams themselves having to be prescreened and practice social distancing throughout.
 Rossi has leaned on drivers in the NASCAR Cup Series who have been forced to endure the similar fate of racing behind closed doors since returning on May 17. Overall, the hope is Texas will be the only race where fans won't be able to attend an IndyCar event, especially since the second race of the revised season won't take place until July 4 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course.
 "In talking to some of the Cup guys, it's a weird experience," said Rossi. "I think that coming out of this we're all going to love being able to go to events again, love being able to share that with our fans and partners, and ultimately that's what I'm looking forward to the most. But yeah, it's a gap after Texas, but hopefully, that gap leads into the current plan of July 4th weekend.
 "We'll race at Indianapolis with some fans. Fingers crossed, and that's what we're all heading towards, and we all have the same goal in mind."

The Celtic mantra from Brad Stevens during the pandemic-induced absence from basketball normalcy has been about “staying a week away from your best shape.”
 And with the club able to open its practice facility for voluntary individual player sessions this week, the light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter. The NBA is preparing to offer more concrete plans on Thursday.
 “We have a number of players that are here in Boston,” said Stevens, who, by league rule, is not allowed to take part in the exercises. “We have a number of players that are going in. The value of those individual workouts, I think right now, especially with the facility being back open, is you’re back on the NBA court with all the NBA lines. You’re able to expand and a do a little bit more conditioning on a full court.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — Before the coronavirus upended the world, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was in trouble.
 His own party rebelled against him. Federal prosecutors investigated him. Embarrassing lawsuits loomed.
 But now some believe that the Republican governor has been able to use his daily virus news conferences to stabilize his reputation ahead of the primary elections next week, while drowning out competitors whose campaigns have been drastically hamstrung by the pandemic.
 “The irony is, he could be the comeback kid because of the crisis," said Robert Rupp, a history and political science professor at West Virginia Wesleyan College.
 The governor's apparent rebound offers yet another illustration of how dramatically the COVID-19 pandemic has turned life upside down in the U.S. It also reinforces the notion that the politics of 2020 are sure to be infused with its implications, from the presidential contest on down.
 In West Virginia and other states, incumbent governors on the ballot this year have been given a daily platform to demonstrate leadership. Upstart challengers more dependent on retail politics to make their names known have found themselves locked down in quarantine for weeks.

He's particularly strong opposite Malkovich. Their give and take - military might versus a better tomorrow through science - is always compelling as it is thoughtful. And the hard-earned friendship developing between the two opposites is often unexpectedly moving. Same with Naird's frayed relationship with his 15-year-old daughter, Erin (or Bug, as he calls her), whose cries for attention too often go unheeded. Carell and Silvers ("Booksmart") prove outstanding sparring partners thanks to the unmitigated spunk they bring to the fight.
 And don't get me started on how wonderful Carell and Kudrow are together, particularly in the episode sending them stumbling their way through their first conjugal visit. But why are the writers concealing the reason for Maggie Naird's "very long sentence"? That's just one of the glaring plot holes in a storyline with all the traits of having been rushed into production to capitalize on the freshness of the real Space Force being ripe for ridicule.
 The production design, though, is feature-film quality; including a convincing moon landing and a sprawling, clandestine Space Force base in the desolate Colorado foothills (You'll love the nod to "Get Smart" in the opening of Episode One), a la Area 51. It's neat how it resembles a thriving avant-garde college campus more than a hub for a fledgling service branch fighting to not just earn credibility, but struggling over whether it's mission should be one of peace or one -- as Dr. Mallory says -- of "turning space into an orgy of death." Despite its intent of parody, "Space Force" treats the debate with utter respect before making it a major plot point in the thrilling season- ender.
 It's good stuff. And after a slow start, "Space Force" starts to come together just when it's time to create a cliffhanger promising a likely Season 2. It deserves that opportunity on the strength of Carell alone. But if it's to be, you'd like "Space Force" to evolve into something a little less earthbound and a little more out of this world.

 In 2013, the car club moved its monthly cruise-ins from Towne Square Mall to downtown in an effort to help bring more people downtown at a time when Smothers Park was still under construction and the convention center hadn’t opened.
 They are scheduled on the first Saturday of each month from April through October.

On paper, the estimated labor force of 35,000 people involved in production, and associated engineers and support, at Airbus would fall by the equivalent of some 14,000 full-time posts with the 40per cent underlying reduction, the sources said.
 One industry source said the output trajectory pointed to the equivalent of 15-20,000 job cuts, depending on the pace of recovery and extent to which Airbus wants to preserve skills.
 Airbus declined to comment.
 UNION OPPOSITION
 The sources said it is too early to say how many of those cuts would translate into redundancies and how many would be absorbed through less temporary work or by the supply chain.
 Airbus, which has previously only cut about half its costs through job losses, could also divide the shake-up into two or more separate stages to gauge the speed of recovery in air travel from the crisis, the sources added.
 Unions have pledged to oppose widespread restructuring ahead of management meetings due next week after Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury warned staff over the company's future.
 In 2007, Airbus launched a plan to cut the equivalent of 10,000 posts, shared between staff and contractors, but ended up shedding some 8,000.
 At that time rising demand helped Airbus meet cost-cutting targets per plane by producing more jets. But with a slump in air travel, that "volume" lever is no longer useful.
 The result is a sharper focus than ever on fixed overheads, without which Airbus would have to raise prices.
 Airbus has already told employees it is closing a digital-transformation unit set up by Faury's predecessor Tom Enders, but insiders fear the crisis is so deep it may have to re-examine a jigsaw of factories spread across Europe.
 "It's time to look at sacred cows," one source said.
 In the past Airbus avoided plant closures and struck political deals to double up some tasks, including building some wings in Britain which are sent to Germany to be finished. It also has two delivery centers for the soon-to-be- axed A380.

The challenge facing Steve Carell and the mastermind behind his career-making turn in NBC's "The Office" is to render their hotly anticipated Netflix series, "Space Force," funnier than the real neo-government agency founded by an increasingly unhinged president of the United States. Good luck with that.
 Yet, while failing to reach orbit, Carell and show-runner Greg Daniels summon just enough thrust to puncture our COVID-19-filled atmosphere with a mix of droll humor, stumbling satire and warm snuggly relationships. Laughs? I had a few, but far short of those to be had in a single episode of "The Office." I'm also not a fan of the vague character arcs, episodic format or a disappointing tendency to play it safe.
 So, what's the lure? Carell, that's what! The part-time Marshfield resident is huge in his three-dimensional characterization of fictional four-star Air Force Gen. Mark Naird, the newly appointed director of Trump's much-ridiculed Space Force. The agency, natch, is announced in a Tweet promising to put "boobs (sic) on the moon by 2024." And it's up to Naird and his multi-billion- dollar budget to make it happen. But before achieving liftoff, Naird must first conquer the New Frontiers of an imprisoned wife (Lisa Kudrow), a selfish, rebellious daughter (a terrific find in Diana Silvers) and a temperamental scientist (think Tony Fauci) in John Malkovich's marvelously cranky and cantankerous Dr. Adrian Mallory.

 The three have Baird questioning his sanity; all while POTUS (never seen or named, but obviously Trump) and money-pinching lawmakers, including a thinly veiled AOC (Ginger Gonzaga), tighten the screws on producing a major success before the first season wraps. It's never a doubt the project will be a GO! But reaching those aspirations often results in a clunky trajectory driven off course by jittery plotting by Daniels' team of writers alternating between being too slow and overly rushed.
 They throw more than a dozen characters at the screen in hopes of seeing who will stick long enough to reach Season 2. Some, like the late, great Fred Willard as Naird's senile father, and Noah Emmerich as the general's macho rival and former boss, are forgotten almost as soon as they're introduced. Ditto for brief cameos by Jane Lynch and Patrick Warburton as Naird's fellow chiefs of staff. The characters that do thrive are all impressive, including Jimmy O. Yang ("Silicon Valley") as a young hot-shot engineer and Tawny Newsome as a wannabe astronaut catching his nerdy eye. By the way, I could do without Ben Schwartz's obnoxious, over-the-top turn as Baird's hyper, Tweet- happy publicist, Tony Scarapiducci, a too obvious send-up of real-life manic Trump trumpeter Anthony Scaramucci. But the less said about him the better.
 What about the positive? Well, that begins with Carell, the sitcom's center of gravity. As co-creator of the big-budget series, he conjures a role geared to his strength, namely his uncanny ability to shift on a dime from comedy to drama and back. To portray a general who also happens to be a war hero (his F-15 was shot down over Serbia), you must exude gravitas, which Carell does well in creating a four-star general you can believe in. Not sure what's up with Naird's gravelly voice, but you remain impressed by how well Carell fills the uniform, both physically (love those stiff straight shoulders) and psychologically.

I’ve noticed so many different species of birds. I even got a guidebook. The binoculars are on order. This may be a commentary on where I live in Bethlehem. It may be commonplace for many.
 I watched a big grey hawk swoop into one of our arborvitae trees, plunge itself deep in the tree — while a gaggle of blackbirds swirled around squawking — and then emerge with a plump bird between its talons, then fly away.
 The other night at dinner a fox appeared on the patio. As we all met its eyes through the glass door, it did a vertical leap straight up and over the patio railing. The move defied gravity and put Michael Jordan to shame.
 MJ is foremost in my mind. We spent five evenings watching 10 episodes of sports documentary that recalls the Chicago Bulls 1998 championship season. Back when that season was unfolding in real-time during my life, I didn’t watch five minutes of it.
 I learned that Michael Jordan is meaner than I thought. I’ve also learned that Tony Soprano is nicer.
 I didn’t have HBO back in the day. We’ve been living with Tony Soprano, his family and crew during the quarantine. I wasn’t aware of his softer side.
 This is all happening because I have time. There are no speeches to give, events to attend or business dinners. When the workday ends, I walk out of my office and into my living room and life begins.
 My youngest son and his girlfriend have been living with us since March 18 when they left Brooklyn. They live upstairs, working remotely.

The global pandemic that has brought state economies to their knees may wind up being more than just a trim off the top. If the hope was for something akin to Gov. Charlie Baker's once-a-year charity buzz cut, the reality might look more like a shave with a rusty Bic razor.
 The governor did, as it turns out, get his hair cut early last Tuesday morning as barbershops and salons were among the businesses to get the go-ahead from the state this week to resume operations. He and his barber wore masks, his temperature was checked at the door, and Plexiglas separated his chair from other cutting stations.
 Offices everywhere but Boston were also allowed to reopen under limited capacities, as were retail stores for curbside pickup and car washes and pet groomers. But it's going to take more than just a few new hair-dos to stabilize the state's fiscal slide.
 As Congress bickers over the size and scope of the next federal relief package, the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation warned this week that the pillars of the state's economy - health care, higher education, tourism - could be so fundamentally shaken that a sharp "V" shaped recovery is no longer possible.
 A vaccine or viable treatment for COVID-19 remains the Holy Grail to resuming normal activities, and without it the fiscal watchdog group predicted that state tax revenue may not fully rebound until fiscal 2025.
 What that means for next year, however, is still anyone's guess. Much remains unknown about how lawmakers will approach budgeting for the fiscal year that begins July 1, and how much money will be available to spend. MTF and others have predicted that as much as $6 billion in anticipated revenues could disappear. But that's just a guess, and Congress could fill some of that hole.
 More than 90 economists and the influential Raise Up Massachusetts coalition of community, faith and labor organizations implored Beacon Hill last week to consider tax increases - namely on businesses - before resorting to deep budget cuts that could erode important safety nets for struggling families.
 But a vaccine or treatment is critical to more than just economic vibrancy. It's necessary, under Gov. Baker's reopening strategy, to unlock Phase 4 - "New Normal."
 Without it, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and the Boston Athletic Association determined that it was just too risky to try to run the iconic Boston marathon in September.
 Officials had postponed the 123-year-old road race from April 20 to Sept. 14 with the hope that a large gathering of athletes and spectators from around the world might be safe by late summer. That is no longer the case. And so for the first time since 1897, there will be no official 26.2-mile road race. No special state holiday to celebrate that feat of athleticism. And no excuse to play morning baseball.
 Walsh is proceeding much slower than what it would take to pull off any of that. For now, finding ways to clear sidewalk and street space for outdoor dining feels more achievable.
 Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said Friday that restaurants would be allowed to reopen to diners for outdoor service at the start of Phase 2, which won't begin until June 8 at the earliest. Indoor dining will follow in Phase 2, but just not at the start, and parties will be limited to 6, with no seating at the bar.
 The governor said he will make the call on whether to proceed to the next phase of reopening on Saturday, June 6, depending on the health metrics that for much of this week showed encouraging, if slow, progress.
 The other part of reopening that doesn't get as much attention is that even as businesses start to reawaken, consumers may not be in the right headspace to go back to life as they knew it. A MassINC Polling Center survey released last week found that 44 percent of people were likely to take fewer trips outside their home than before the pandemic, and 28 percent said those trips were more likely to be alone in their car.
 In fact, 67 percent said they weren't fully comfortable with the idea of returning to public transportation, underscoring the challenge facing public officials of not just restoring services like the MBTA, but restoring confidence in their safety.
 MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said that part of his agency's strategy will be to implement new "crowding thresholds" on buses and trains to enable mask- wearing passengers to also keep socially distant. Once that threshold is reached, Poftak said the T is looking at ways to bring on additional service, or to offer alternate but overlapping modes of transit, to help people safely get where they're going.
 Convincing people to return to public transit is not the only sales pitch officials will be making this summer.
 Education Commissioner Jeff Riley said that while it will ultimately be the governor's call, it's his intention to have K-12 schools "up and running" in the fall when classes would normally resume. This school year, obviously, got cut short, and Riley said the plan is also for high school sophomores that were supposed to take English and math MCAS exams this spring to instead get the test this winter.
 As challenging, perhaps, as one of those MCAS questions, the state budget has understandably flummoxed legislators who can feel the fiscal ground shifting underneath them on a daily basis, but another matter that has vexed leaders for weeks got done.
 The House and Senate finally came together to send Gov. Baker a bill that would require substantially more reporting on the impact of COVID-19 and testing efforts.
 But there's no doubt the bill would have packed more punch if the branches didn't spend over a month passing it back and forth and arguing over who cares more about seniors. It took a "still, still, still further amendment" from the Senate to get the details just right, which is legislative parlance for too many changes.
 In the intervening time, the administration's Command Center significantly ramped up its reporting efforts on the reach of COVID-19, especially at long- term care facilities. The state began publishing what will be new daily and weekly updates on testing at nursing homes, deaths by long-term care facility, city and town testing totals and positive test rates by municipality, among other metrics.
 So will Baker sign it? He answered that question with a question Friday. "Can I read it first?" he asked.
 The Legislature's bill does cover the state-run soldiers' homes in Chelsea and in Holyoke, where the governor was reluctant last week to say much, other than to defer to the special investigation he commissioned into the outbreak at the Holyoke hospital for veterans.
 Baker maintains that he and Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders didn't find out about the outbreak in Holyoke until one Sunday night in March when it was too late to contain. By morning Superintendent Bennett Walsh had been removed, and Baker hired an outside lawyer to probe what had happened.
 But Walsh's lawyer this week released emails, according to reports, that he and Walsh say prove that the superintendent had kept Veterans' Affairs Secretary Francisco Urena and Medicaid Director Dan Tsai apprised of what was happening with COVID-19 infections at the home throughout the outbreak.
 Holyoke isn't the only long-term care facility in the crosshairs of investigators.
 Attorney General Maura Healey said this week her office would be investigating Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley, where U.S. Rep. Lori Trahan said more than 20 residents and health care workers have died and dozens have tested positive.

The move led to calls of an alternative to saliva from current and former players including India premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah. "So in cricket, you have the surface that you can play around with and bring about a balance between the bat and ball," said Kumble at a FICCI webinar.
 The bowlers will miss using saliva the most in Test cricket as it aids them in generating both conventional and reverse swing.
 "...you can still probably leave grass on the surface or even have two spinners, let's get spinners back in the game in a Test because one day game or a T20 you are not really worried about shining the ball. It's Test match that we are talking about," said the former India captain.
 "And in a Test match why not get two spinners to play in Australia, two in England, which doesn't happen often."
 Like he had said right after recommending the saliva ban as an interim measure, Kumble reiterated that allowing the use of artificial substances would have taken the creativity out of the game.
 "We can probably use some other substance on the ball. All these years we have been very, very stringent on what to use on or what not to use on the ball," he said.
 "We've been very strict about substances that have been used on the ball. That was something that we felt, the creativity was something that we should not (tinker with)," he said.
 Kumble, however, admitted that it would be hard for players to adjust to not using saliva.
 "Although it is second nature in cricket, and that's something that players will find it hard to manage. And that''s why I believe that at training, they'd like to start slowly because it's not just about coming back and playing cricket in a match," he said.
 "It's also about coming back from two and a half months of being locked up... And especially if you're a bowler, you need to have those bowling overs under your belt before you start competing.
 "So, it's important that you slowly and gradually come back into sort of normalcy that you can and the advantage that cricket has over other sports is that there''s an element of adjustable variance in the pitch, which not many sport have," he added.
 Kumble said the committee's recommendations focused on resumption of cricket at the earliest.
 "... I know there's been a lot of debate about shining the ball but the idea was to kickstart cricket, play the sport, and then I'm sure things will fall in place. Yes, there will be some challenges. You have to go one game at a time.
 "We've given just broad guidelines from the ICC to the various boards because each country has its own challenges and within the country itself you see in India, you know, for example, Maharashtra has its own challenges, Karnataka is different, etc."
 Talking about the proposed Test series between England and West Indies next month, Kumble said gaining match fitness won't be easy for the players who have been out of action for more than two months.
 "The players will have to have some sort of a cushion, some sort of a backup in terms of loading up the body to be able to sustain Test match because bowling 30 overs for a bowler is not going to be easy and even for a batsman, you know, the muscles that you use when you're batting is totally different.
 "...in a match situation, you know, you're doing everything at the split of a second and then you're not training for those, especially in a home condition.
 "So, you need to fill it up and probably have a few friendly games before you get into an important Test match."
 Kumble said one way of managing players' workload in the current situation is treating them as a group which is making a comeback from injury.
 "That's all you need to look at the entire squad now saying okay, they've all been injured for the last three months, they are now coming back into training," he said.
 "So, you need to slowly load them up and then start building their skill levels ...I think it's mostly confidence. Once the players are out and training, it comes back very quickly," he added.

 "I have about four of five thousand reports from some keepers you watch 10 or 15 times and then you stay on top of it. If you think they can be OK for us then you have to keep following them and you always have to prepare for a No.1, 2 or 3.
 "You try to find out about 14, 15 or 16-year-olds. Do we need one? Can we bring them in? You always look at who is out of contract, who has one year left, so that the transfer fee won't be too high and then obviously you have the best list ready for whatever needs to happen.

Beyond the now fabled 'transfer committee', though, Liverpool are at the forefront of a scouting revolution across the game.
 For years, clubs have clung to the traditional model of identifying players, dispatching scouts to watch players live in action before listening to the assessments in their feedback.
 But with the game starting to embrace a new-age, the Reds are helping to pioneer digital techniques that are being used to unearth ability in never- ending recruitment searches.
 The naked eye of an experienced talent-spotter will perhaps never be beaten when it comes to gathering information on potential players, but with the game so vast - and more competitive than ever - whittling down potential targets has become a tough task.
 Liverpool's scouting network is a sprawling, global operation, but back at base in West Derby, director of research Ian Graham and his team are helping Klopp and Edwards shine a light on lesser-known players with potential.
 "We get data on every ball touch that every player makes in a game, where it was on the pitch, and what happened next," Graham explains. "We can see where all of the players are, at 25 frames per second. It’s done with optical tracking. The same technology that is used for missile-tracking.
 "The thing that I’m really obsessed about is the risk-reward payoff of passes. So, some of the best passers in the game have some of the lowest pass- completion percentages in the game. And that’s because the risk-reward payoff is very, very skewed in soccer or football.
 "And the passes I really love are the passes that go in behind the opposition defence, that take four or five defenders out of the game. Those passes are really hard to make. But someone who gets those passes correct half the time would be a world-class attacking midfielder.
 "So you’ve got the traditional methods of scouting, some newer methods of video scouting, the coaches and the manager have to be on board and enthusiastic about the player. My role is the data-analysis side of analyzing football, which is the newer side."
 Graham's work was believed to have been integral in helping identify both Naby Keita and Salah as players Klopp should be targeting, while the numbers found in Andy Robertson's data made his signing something of a no-brainer for a club who needed a left-back in the summer of 2017.

The district administration, the labour department and the police released 150 women from a garment factory in Doddaballapur in a joint operation on June 2. All the women hail from Odisha and were sent to their hometowns in a Shramik Special train on Tuesday itself.
 Officials are now on the lookout for the owner of the garment factory who is on the run. At least 22 of the women were brought to the factory in February this year. They told the police that they were asked to continue working during the lockdown but they were not paid any wages. They also stated that they were forced to work even if they were sick and they were not given sufficient rations during the lockdown, officials said. During this period, they had to make do with inconsistent supply of water and rations.
 As soon as the lockdown was lifted the girls wanted to return home, but their employer allegedly did not give them permission to leave the factory premises.
 A release stated that a total of 199 girls were working at the garment factory and lived in two hostels nearby. While 150 of them decided to leave, the rest have chosen to remain behind and continue working.

One of the most common, and avoidable reasons for claims to be denied is a delay in reporting the injury. Georgia law gives injured workers 30 days from the date of injury to report it to their employer. Failure to report the injury within this timeframe can result in the case being thrown out. While they have a full 30 days, it is generally advised that injured workers report the incident as soon as possible to avoid issues like these. It can also be helpful for the worker to request a written confirmation of the report from their employer, this can ensure that the employer promptly files a claim with the state workers' compensation board.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said of Trump posing for photos holding up a Bible, “I just wish he opened it once in a while.”
 It was Attorney General William Barr who gave the order for law enforcement to clear out the protest before Trump’s walk to the church ahead of Washington’s 7 p.m. curfew. A person familiar with the matter said the decision was made earlier Monday, but had not been executed by the time Barr arrived in Lafayette Park to survey the scene. He verbally gave the order at that time.
 After the demonstrators had been pushed out of the park, Trump emerged from the White House with several officials, including Esper and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Senior defense officials told reporters Milley was also not aware that the Park Police and law enforcement had made a decision to clear the square or that Trump intended to visit the church. They had been in Washington to coordinate with federal law enforcement officials but were diverted to the White House to brief Trump on military preparations, the officials said.
