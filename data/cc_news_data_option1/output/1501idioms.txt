As an investor, it’s important to understand that IBM is on the verge of embarking on a new journey. In a way, it can be considered as an extension to Rometty’s original strategic initiatives, but Krishna’s vision has far greater razor-like focus rather than being a loose collection of ‘general cloud-facing directions’ the company wanted to move in under Rometty.
 IBM’s cloud business might still be dwarfed by those of Amazon, Microsoft, and Google at this point in time. However, Red Hat is exactly the kind of second wind that IBM needs to catch up to the cloud crowd and make its mark at the top.
 If you've grudgingly held IBM in your portfolio for a long time, I encourage you to avoid the temptation to cut your losses and move on during this dip. It might be the biggest mistake you make in tech investing to give up now. And if you’re a potential investor, this is a good time to get in on the action. I think the stock will pick up significant momentum when Krishna’s new strategy starts to strengthen the company’s position as an enabler of multicloud and hybrid cloud environments, which are clearly the future of cloud computing. It might take several quarters for that to happen considering the current situation and its aftermath, but the stars are aligned for IBM to make its big move.

It was a tough decision to make, but it turned out to be the right one when those in charge cancelled the first-ever First Responders and Military/Veteran Appreciation Dinner.  
 A day before the March 12 event, which was to be held at Grace Chapel (old Shopko building), the Minerva Rotary Club decided to pull the plug on the dinner due to the COVID-10 pandemic.  
 A lot of time, effort and planning had gone into transforming the banquet room into a beautiful tribute to first responders, as well as military and veteran personnel.  
 Former Minerva superintendent Mike Gallina was set to be the master of ceremonies, and a family-style dinner was going to be provided by the local Amish community.  
 Proceeds were to benefit local fire departments and EMS, including Sandy Creek Joint Fire District and EMS, Augusta Township Fire Department, and Fox Township Fire Department; Minerva Police Department; local military organizations, including the Military Family Center, Save 22, and the VFW; and the Minerva Rotary Club.

Russ Wilcox was sacked by Scunthorpe last week after a poor start to the campaign, which had seen the club pick up just two wins in League One following last season's promotion.


  With Andy Dawson in temporary charge and Robins watching from the stands, Scunthorpe beat Gillingham 3-0 at the Priestfield Stadium on Saturday.


  Robins has now signed a three-year deal, the former Manchester United striker returning to management for the first time since leaving Huddersfield Town in August.


  "First and foremost, I'm delighted. I watched the game on Saturday and was very encouraged with what I saw," said the 44-year-old at a media conference on Monday.


  "Gillingham is not an easy place to go and we controlled that game.


  "Every job is a different challenge but saying that, it's also the same challenge, we have to start picking points up.


  "You've got to work hard and make sure the players are capable of doing what you ask of them. If not, that's when we look at changes."


  Robins' first game in charge will come on Saturday when Colchester United are the visitors to Glanford Park.


  Chairman Peter Swann added: "When I made the decision [to dismiss Wilcox], I had an idea of who I wanted. Mark has a proven track record.


  "We both bought into each other. What Mark wants, I want and vice versa.


  "It's a three-year deal. There's protection in there for the club and there's protection for Mark as well."

Sanders’s exit, too, has occupied a lot of the Biden brain trust’s time. A handful of his most trusted advisers and Sanders’s were in touch behind the scenes for weeks leading up to the Vermonter’s dropout and endorsement, at times talking through specific initial policy concessions Biden could make — he budged on education funding and bankruptcy, and began what many in his world see as an inevitable shift on Medicare policy — and eventually ways for the pair to collaborate further moving forward. Though Biden and Sanders didn’t speak directly until Sanders made his final decision, they both talked extensively with Obama about how to wrap up the primary and pivot effectively to the general election. Obama told both that he expected Sanders to have a major public role in the general election campaign, and both, separately, agreed. Top advisers to the senator, meanwhile, made clear to Biden’s inner circle that they had no intention of making this spring and summer look like 2016’s, when Sanders fought Clinton to the final days of the campaign, battling for specific policy changes and holding back his support until July. Instead, the Sanders and Biden representatives landed on a plan to announce “working groups” focused on six policy areas that would give the democratic socialist a say in the nominee’s direction.

Ronald Koeman's side struck three times in the opening half and, although their attacking play was impressive, they were helped on their way to a club- record top-flight win by a number of mistakes from the visitors.
 Santiago Vergini's spectacular own goal after 12 minutes gave Southampton the lead, with Graziano Pelle, boosted by a goal on his Italy debut on Monday, capping a memorable week with his fifth league goal of the season six minutes later.
 Jack Cork added the third before half-time, substitute Liam Bridcutt bundled home a second own goal just past the hour and Pelle made it five with his second after 68 minutes.
 Dusan Tadic, Victor Wanyama and Sadio Mane completed the rout in the closing minutes as Southampton, who are unbeaten at home this season, stay third in the table.
 Meanwhile, Sunderland remain in the bottom half after suffering their heaviest defeat of the campaign.
 The hosts began in positive fashion and were gifted the opener as Vergini fired into his own net.
 Shane Long, recalled for Mane as one of two changes, played a neat one-two with Pelle, but as Vergini tried to get the ball under control he volleyed beyond Vito Mannone from the edge of the box.
 Sunderland, who recalled Wes Brown for Billy Jones, continued to be their own worst enemy as a mistake from Will Buckley led to Southampton's second goal six minutes later.
 The midfielder's attempted clearance struck the back of Sebastian Larsson, the loose ball was rolled onto Steven Davis and his low cross was tapped home by the in-form Pelle.
 Fraser Forster had maintained a watching brief up to that point but he was called into action after 20 minutes, the England international getting down well to parry Larsson's free-kick.
 With half-time looming Steven Fletcher saw a penalty shout waved away, and to rub salt into Sunderland's wounds Koeman's side added a third eight minutes before the interval.
 Tadic superbly found Cork at the back post and his effort somehow beat Mannone, who should have done better.
 Pelle was causing the Sunderland defence all kinds of problems and, after setting up Davis for a chance on goal, he saw his effort cleared off the line by Patrick van Aanholt.
 The fourth goal eventually came three minutes after the hour, though.
 Ryan Bertrand raced clear on the left, his pull-back found Pelle whose effort saved, but Bridcutt clumsily turned the ball into his own goal from two yards.
 As Sunderland began to sink without a trace Pelle added a fifth, the striker latching onto a Tadic pass before firing across Mannone.
 To add to Sunderland's nightmare they conceded another two goals inside as many minutes as first Tadic and then substitute Wanyama got themselves on the scoresheet.
 Tadic capitalised on a dreadful clearance from Mannone to fire into an empty net from 25 yards, and a minute later Wanyama lashed home the seventh from inside the penalty area.
 If Sunderland thought the scoring was over they were wrong, as substitute Mane made it eight with four minutes to play with a simple finish from another Tadic delivery.

Something has to give at the Juventus Stadium, with both teams boasting a 100 per cent record in Serie A, and Garcia expects his side to build on their midweek draw with Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League.


  Juventus won both matches between the two sides last season but Roma will hope to follow up the champions' defeat to Atletico Madrid by inflicting another loss on Massimiliano Allegri's side.


  Garcia knows his team face a stern test but vowed to attack Juve and go for victory.


  "If you're in this job, you aspire to be involved in games like this," the Frenchman said at a media conference on Saturday. "We'll pull out all the stops in Turin to make sure we're able to play our game and show our ambition.


  "Roma always play to win and we'll approach it the same way as on Tuesday [against City], with the ambition to cause problems.


  "Juve have a strong physical presence on the field, we have to be up for that. We have to win balls in defence too and you can't do that with ballet shoes, you need to fight."


  Juve's Carlos Tevez has scored six goals in as many games in all competitions and Garcia knows Roma must stop the Argentine if they are to move ahead of their rivals.


  "I think Tevez is their most decisive player," he added. "The numbers tell you that.


  "Juve are a complete team, a quality outfit. They're not unbeatable though, we saw that on Wednesday.


  "I'm focused on us and I have faith in my players."

The Wearsiders came into the weekend without a win in the league, but a brace from Stephen Fletcher proved crucial for Poyet's men after Connor Wickham's early opener was cancelled out by Charlie Adam.
 An inability to score goals had seen Sunderland draw five of their previous six games, but their attacking talent finally clicked at the Stadium of Light, to lift them up to 11th in the league.
 Poyet said: "It's a good feeling. I'm very pleased for the players.
 "We knew inside the camp that we were a difficult team to play against, but without a win there's always some doubts and some nerves, so I think it was very important for the players to win this game.
 "I'm very pleased for Fletcher because I know hard it was for him to be in the situation where a few weeks ago I left him out of the squad.
 "He wasn't happy but he took it professionally and kept working. The previous week when we played Swansea we were able to see something special in him. He was getting back to his best in training and he had a chance to score and this week he was outstanding."
 The fine form of Wickham and Fletcher in tandem left Poyet in no doubt the duo can play a crucial role in Sunderland's season.
 "I thought he [Wickham] was very good up front as a striker but to put Fletcher into the shape of the team, I had to ask him to go a little bit wide and he liked it.
 "I was surprised he liked it because I would prefer to play him through the middle and the third goal showed you why he likes to play in that position.
 "He was outstanding in his runs, power, ability, vision. So he's shown that he's improving all the time."

  That’s good news for district teachers and students at any time, but never more than right now.


  When Gov. Jay Inslee closed Washington’s public and private school buildings in March to slow the coronavirus spread, Walla Walla joined other districts in turning quickly to the use of learning packets.


  That meant relying on Gabel’s expertise in putting on paper what teachers have designed in software.


  That first week was a bit of a madhouse, Gabel conceded.


  “We had about eight people in here, and we sent out deliveries to schools four or five times a day,” she said.


  “We were running 16 hours a day when we were hardest hit.”


  The emailed requests zipped from teachers to Gabel’s shop at lightning speed.


  “I had so many online orders it was scary, considering every email could have 20 attachments in it,” she recalled.


  Gabel has yet to know what the COVID-19 shutdowns will mean for her numbers, but there’s no question the annual average of 600,000 copies no longer stands. That number was almost matched in the week of March 16-20 alone, when about 500,000 copies were produced, she said.

WARRENSBURG — Aaron Schildknecht, Solar Pro Print n Tunes manager, is using the materials and distributors available to his business in order to help provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to a local fundraiser.


  The fundraiser, a collaboration between the Stealth Panther Robotics Team and Johnson County citizens Nick Anderson and John Wisocky, began to raise funds for supplies to manufacture face shields using 3D printers.


  Schildknecht reached out to Wisocky to offer to help with the fundraiser, which he was able to do in multiple ways.


  With the help of Wisocky, Schildknecht constructed an intubation box, which can be used to protect care providers from potentially being exposed to COVID-19 when intubating (opening up the airway to give oxygen, anesthesia or medicine to help a person breathe) a patient.


  The box was constructed from a design Wisocky provided.


  Schildknecht said a number of people have created 3D design files for certain PPEs and posted them online so those with 3D printers can get these files and print them as long as they have the required materials.


  However, Schildknecht said he and Wisocky built the box “the old-fashioned way” with a saw and a router.


  Schildknecht said they took non-wasteful measurements so as not to throw away materials they could use in the future.


  The materials required to construct an intubation box are quarter-inch clear acrylic plastic sheets.


  Schildknecht also assisted in helping Wisocky acquire materials required to construct face shields.


  While they were able to construct the intubation box with materials on-hand at Solar Pro Tint n Tunes, the business does not typically utilize the thin, clear plastic used to construct face shields.


  This did not stop Schildknecht from helping however he could, as he then contacted Solar Pro Tint n Tune’s distributor to order the materials used in face shields to assist the fundraiser.


  Schildknecht said the materials had to be back ordered due to their high demand and it took a bit longer to receive than usual, but the materials eventually arrived for the Stealth Panther Robotics Team to make use of on Monday, April 6.


  With the help of Schildknecht and a number of donators, the Stealth Panther Robotics Team has been able to donate face shields to Western Missouri Medical Center and the Johnson County Emergency Operations Center.


  In addition to the intubation box Schildknecht and Wisocky made, Wisocky and his team were able to make a second intubation box and both were donated to WMMC.


  Excess face shields created through Wisocky’s fundraiser will be provided to the Kansas City PPE drive assisting Kansas City hospitals with any remaining supplies will be donated to local school programs.


  Additionally, Schildknecht hopes to be able to utilize a laser cutter that Solar Pro Tint n Tunes co-owns with Sawyer’s Custom Wood Working to help produce face shields at a faster rate.


  Schildknecht said this process enables six to 10 face shields to be set up and produced all at one time rather than doing it one at a time, reloading materials each time as required by a 3D printer.


  Having utilized a 3D printer at Solar Pro Tint n Tunes until deciding it was not cost effective for his business, Schildknecht said that 3D printers are incredibly useful because they can make any material, but it can be time consuming.


  Schildknecht said he wanted to do what he could to help the fundraiser because he saw this as an opportunity to give back to the community that has supported Solar Pro Tint n Tunes and made it successful.


  “Our community has been so good to us as a business that it’s one of those things where if we can give back, we do,” Schildknecht said. “They’ve supported us for so long, so we’ll do what we can right now to support them. We’re not looking for recognition, just trying to make someone else’s life a little easier.”


  Schildknecht said another major reason for him to reach out to help involved his wife’s position in the healthcare industry.


  “John’s wife is in the medical field and my wife works at a lab that does testing, so it’s pretty close to us,” Schildknecht said.


  Schildknecht also said he hopes to continue seeing businesses and individuals in the community doing what they can to help local health care providers as it can be difficult for hospitals in rural areas to acquire the materials needed during a pandemic.


  Schildknecht said that in addition to Wisocky, he appreciates everything Joe Boben, Anderson and the Stealth Panther Robotics Team are doing to provide PPEs to the community.

_Oggi e Pasqua. Ora a me tocca l'onore e l'onere di fare da esecutore testamentario della preziosa eredita che questo nostro fratello lascia alla sua adorata e amata famiglia, alla comunita della "Piccola Famiglia dell'Assunta" di Montetauro, alla nostra povera e grande famiglia della Chiesa diocesana. Apriamo dunque il testamento spirituale di Maurizio. Non e un testamento semplicemente redatto nero su bianco, con carta e penna, ma intarsiato a tutto tondo con l'inchiostro del day-by-day, di una normale quotidianita, sul rotolo di una vita coerentemente e pienamente vissuta come un autentico "cristiano" della porta accanto. Questo e stato il nostro Maurizio: un uomo cristiano, di una umanita forte e mite. Un cristiano- cristiano, un discepolo innamorato di Gesu e della sua Chiesa. Un cristiano padre di famiglia, di una semplice, splendida famiglia di ben dieci figli, nata dall'amore tenero e gratuito di Maurizio e Mariuccia. Un cristiano-medico che ha esercitato la professione lasciandosi abitare dagli "stessi sentimenti che furono in Cristo Gesu", il quale "passo beneficando e risanando tutti". Un cristiano che ha puntato sulla misura alta della santita, entrando a far parte insieme a Mariuccia, da giovanissimi sposi, come una delle primissime famiglie della neonata comunita "Piccola Famiglia dell'Assunta". Un cristiano-diacono che ha amato e servito la Chiesa da povero servo, umile, disponibile, sempre gioioso e sorridente. Come si vede, dalla sua vita risulta che cristiano e un sostantivo, non un aggettivo puramente decorativo. E' la base, non un esponente remoto ed evanescente._

 It was a tough decision to make, but it turned out to be the right one when those in charge cancelled the first-ever First Responders and Military/Veteran Appreciation Dinner.  
 A day before the March 12 event, which was to be held at Grace Chapel (old Shopko building), the Minerva Rotary Club decided to pull the plug on the dinner due to the COVID-10 pandemic.  
 A lot of time, effort and planning had gone into transforming the banquet room into a beautiful tribute to first responders, as well as military and veteran personnel.  
 Former Minerva superintendent Mike Gallina was set to be the master of ceremonies, and a family-style dinner was going to be provided by the local Amish community.  
 Proceeds were to benefit local fire departments and EMS, including Sandy Creek Joint Fire District and EMS, Augusta Township Fire Department, and Fox Township Fire Department; Minerva Police Department; local military organizations, including the Military Family Center, Save 22, and the VFW; and the Minerva Rotary Club.

 Suspected killers of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, daughter of Pa Reuben Fasorantin, the leader of the PAN-Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Afenifere, has been arrested by the Police.
 Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu has also assured diligent prosecution of the suspects and even declared the gang leader, Tambaya wanted.
 Name of the suspects are: Lawal Mazaje 'm' 40yrs from Felele area of Kogi State, Adamu Adamu 'm' 50yrs from Jada area of Adamawa State, Mohammed Shehu Usman 'm' 26 years from Illela area of Sokoto State and Auwal Abubakar 'm' 25 years from Shinkafi area of Zamfara State.
 FPRO, Frank Mba said this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja.
 Part of the statement added, "Recall that on 13th July, 2019, following the attack and murder of Mrs Funke Olakunrin by unknown persons between Kajola and Ore along Ondo-Ore road in Ondo State on 12th July, 2019, the Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, NPM, mni deployed the Commissioner of Police in charge of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS), CP Fimihan Adeoye, to coordinate the team of Police Special Forces and seasoned investigators from the Force Criminal Investigations Department (FCID), Federal SARS, Intelligence Response Team (IRT) and the Technical Intelligence Unit (TIU) from the Force Headquarters, Abuja to carry out a massive manhunt for the killers with the aim of arresting and bringing them to justice.
 "Meanwhile, after months of relentless efforts to apprehend the killers, the Police Team, on 4th March, 2020 during a follow-up action on a case of a high- profile armed robbery and kidnap for ransom that occurred in Ogun State, arrested one Auwal Abubakar 'm' 25yrs, an accessory after the fact of the crime, along Sagamu-Ore expressway in Ondo State.
 "The arrest of Auwal Abubakar led to the arrest of two (2) other members of the gang, Mohammed Shehu Usman and Lawal Mazaje in Benin, Edo State from whom cache of ammunition was recovered and one other Adamu Adamu in Akure, Ondo State.
 "Having established sufficient physical and forensic evidence linking the suspects to the killing of Mrs Funke Olakunrin, the investigators, determined to clear all doubts relating to their findings, on 8th April, 2020, conducted an Identification Parade at the Federal SARS Headquarters, Lagos which led to the positive and physical identification of three (3) suspects, Adamu Adamu, Lawal Mazaje and Mohammed Shehu Usman by a survivor of the earlier crime.
 "The survivor gave a clear description of the roles each of the identified suspects played in the killing. At this point, the suspects capitulated and voluntarily offered a no-holds-barred confession on how Mrs Funke Olakunrin was killed.
 "Investigations so far reveal that the operation that led to the killing was carried out by eight (8) fully armed kidnap/robbery suspects led by one Tambaya (other name unknown) who is currently at large. While four (4) of the suspects (mentioned above) are in custody, effort is being intensified to arrest the four (4) others still on the run.
 "The 8-man gang has its operational base and membership spread in the south- western part of the country and Edo State.
 Investigations have also revealed that they are responsible for a series of high-profile armed robbery and kidnap operations in the region. They also attack, vandalize and steal components of critical national infrastructures such as electrical and telecommunications installations.
 "Consequently, the Inspector General of Police hereby declares the principal suspect, Tambaya (other names unknown) wanted for his involvement in the death of Mrs Funke Olakunrin. Tambaya, a Nigerian, speaks Hausa, Fulfulde and Pidgin English languages.
 "He is fair in complexion and in his late 20s - between the age of 27 and 30. His last known address is Isanlu, Kogi State. He has visible scar from stitches on his forehead down to his nose and mouth.
 "Meanwhile, the IGP appreciates Nigerians for the patience and support to the Police throughout the period of the investigations into the unfortunate incident.
 "He assures that the suspects will be diligently prosecuted on completion of investigations and that the Force will not relent until every member of the gang, still at large, is arrested and brought to book".

Unkempt hair in senior photos.


  It’s been an unprecedented end to a school year for the class of 2020. Among the many hardships brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic has been the ubiquitous tragedy of milestones passing in isolation.


  For high school seniors, spring 2020 should have been a season for breaking track records, producing musicals and accepting well-earned awards – a time to tie up loose ends and finish strong. Commencement ceremonies were planned for May and June, along with trips and parties to celebrate four years of growing together.


  Now, under the mandates of state and local officials, students must spend their final school days apart. And despite a valiant effort from teachers to provide academic normalcy through the realm of online instruction, faces on a screen can’t replace the heady shared significance of a waning high school career.


  “It’s a difficult pill to swallow,” Bret Harte Union High School District Superintendent Mike Chimente told the Enterprise. “Not only to not be able to compete but also to complete.”


  The superintendent has promised seniors at Bret Harte High School a commencement and scholarship ceremony, as well as a senior graduation party and possibly even a trip to Disneyland. But it’s too soon to say when those might happen.


  “We’re going to try, once we can, to create a celebration for our seniors, because it’s truly the right thing to do,” Chimente said.


  At Calaveras High School, there are also hopes for a commencement ceremony and a rescheduled prom.


  “But this is all dependent upon when the stay-at-home order is lifted, when social distancing criteria is lifted,” Calaveras Unified School District Superintendent Mark Campbell said. “There is no way to exactly replicate the time and experiences they are losing, but we aim to try to mitigate these losses as best as we can.”


  One such loss has been the postponement of Calaveras High School’s spring production of “Oklahoma,” which has been in the works since January, with a cast and crew of almost 60 students. On the final day of school on March 13, the cast wiped away their tears, put on their costumes and walked the campus during lunch, singing songs from the musical to entertain their fellow students.


  “It was, hands down, one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do as a teacher,” drama instructor Ann Mazzaferro said of delivering the bad news to her students. “The kids were heartbroken. They worked so hard and were so close to seeing their work and dreams realized.”

The Euro 2016 Group I qualifier last Tuesday took place amid a backdrop of political tensions and things came to a head towards the end of the first half in Belgrade.


  With the game scoreless, a drone carrying a flag featuring Albanian national symbols entered the stadium and hovered over the pitch.


  The two sets of players clashed after Serbia defender Stefan Mitrovic attempted to pull the flag down and a number of supporters then invaded the pitch as the situation escalated.


  Albania's players were pelted with missiles as they left the field and the fixture was duly abandoned, with both teams unable to agree on a resumption.


  UEFA announced their intention to investigate Albania for "refusing to play" and "the display of an illicit banner", while Serbia faced an array of charges.


  On Friday, European football's governing body announced the respective punishments for the two sides, with both fined, while Serbia will be forced to play their next two home qualifiers behind closed doors.


  "The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) met yesterday and announced the following decision after various incidents that occurred during the European Qualifier Group I match between Serbia and Albania, which was played in Belgrade on 14 October," a statement read.


  "The CEDB has decided to declare the above-mentioned match as forfeited.


  "As a consequence, the Football Association of Albania (FShF) is deemed to have lost the match 3-0. In addition, the FShF has been fined €100,000.


  "The CEDB has also decided to deduct the Football Association of Serbia (FSS) three points for the current UEFA European Championship qualifying competition.


  "In addition, the FSS has been ordered to play its next two UEFA competition matches as host team behind closed doors.


  "Finally, the association has been fined €100,000. These decisions are open to appeal."

Brandon Slate, an adventure specialist at Rocky Mountain Outdoor Center in Nathrop, said, “If people can’t travel here from outside the county, our customer base is going to be much smaller than usual.
 “We’re trying to just base decisions on the facts we have, and right now the facts give the federal shelter in place till April 30, the state shelter in place to April 26. So, the facts we have say we’ll be up and running May 1. I realize that could change, but right now we’re just making the decisions based on the facts that we have.”
 “The worst-case scenarios are hanging over us, but when you’re a business, you have to plan until there’s a reason to change that plan,” Hamel said.
 Mark Hammer, owner of The Adventure Company, said he usually hires around 38 seasonal employees who begin arriving between late April and May. The company is still shooting for a Memorial Day opening, but “right now, I’ve told them we are preparing for a season to start later than usual. … They should anticipate coming in a little bit later but working through the season with new practices and procedures in place to offset some of the health risks.
 “With so much uncertainty right now, we are trying to prepare for a rafting season that will be upon us,” Hammer said. “We feel that we will be rafting, we feel that we will solve these challenges. How that affects my hiring is evolving every day.”
 Hamel said snowpack in the Arkansas River Basin looks promising this season, and he predicts the market of small-scale, driving vacations will recover faster than the kind that require logistics and investment in air travel.

Caulker's inadvertent error in the sixth minute of injury time ultimately settled a pulsating Premier League clash in Liverpool's favour, but only after a see-saw battle had produced four goals in the last nine minutes and an almost unbelievable finale.
 Chilean Eduardo Vargas - fresh from a double against Peru on international duty - looked set to grab the headlines heading into injury time.
 On as a 79th-minute replacement for Bobby Zamora, the striker scored for the first time since arriving on loan from Napoli to level at 1-1, and then tied the scores again at 2-2 after Philippe Coutinho's exquisite goal had once again given Liverpool the ascendancy.
 Richard Dunne had earlier put through his own net to open the scoring, in the process becoming the first player in Premier League history to score 10 own goals, but it was his team-mate Caulker whose unwanted contribution proved decisive when he turned the ball past Alex McCarthy.
 The visitors had endured a difficult week which saw Raheem Sterling in the spotlight for feeling tired while on England duty and Daniel Sturridge suffer another injury setback.
 However, Sterling received a warm reception from both sets of supporters, having spent some time at the QPR academy before moving north, and he played a vital role in the goal that eventually won it for the visitors.
 Goalkeeper McCarthy made his Premier League debut for QPR, with Robert Green suffering from tonsillitis, while Rio Ferdinand was dropped to the bench, with Dunne coming in along with Yun Suk-young and Zamora.
 Liverpool made four changes, with Mario Balotelli back in for Rickie Lambert up front, while Glen Johnson and Jose Enrique returned as full-backs and Emre Can played for the first time since the end of August after recovering from an ankle injury.
 QPR started brightly and almost went ahead when Charlie Austin battled past Johnson and Martin Skrtel before being denied by Simon Mignolet rushing out to save with his feet.
 The hosts blew another great chance approaching the half-hour mark when Zamora broke clear down the right and pulled a fine pass back across the area, only for Leroy Fer to fire against the crossbar from eight yards out with the goal at his mercy.
 Fer again hit the woodwork with a header from Zamora's cross and Johnson just managed to clear the danger as Austin and Sandro raced in to pounce on the rebound.
 Liverpool showed little attacking threat throughout the first period but Steven Gerrard went close as the interval approached when curling a shot just wide of the post.
 Harry Redknapp was forced to replace Nedum Onuoha with Matt Phillips during the break but QPR were straight back on the front foot as Sandro forced Mignolet to make a fine save.
 Liverpool started to find more of a rhythm around the hour mark and Balotelli should have scored when McCarthy could only palm out an Adam Lallana effort, but the Italian blasted wildly over the crossbar with the rebound.
 The visitors did take the lead on 67 minutes, though, when quick thinking by Sterling at a set-piece set Johnson free down the right and his low cross was turned into his own net by Dunne.
 Mignolet was at full stretch to keep out a header from substitute Armand Traore and McCarthy saved a Balotelli shot with his legs as the game opened up.
 QPR drew level on 87 minutes as another replacement, Vargas, was first to react to Austin's knock-back after Liverpool had failed to clear a free-kick.
 But that was merely the precursor to even more late drama.
 Coutinho then raced up the other end to put the visitors back in front after being played in by Gerrard, before Vargas struck again with a header two minutes into stoppage time.
 However, even that was not the end of the scoring, as Sterling sprinted in behind the QPR defence and his cross was turned into his own net by a luckless Caulker.

The Trump administration is gutting an Obama-era rule that compelled coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards, limiting future regulation of air pollutants by petroleum and coal plants.


  Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist whose clients have gotten many of the regulatory rollbacks they asked for from the Trump administration, was set to announce the final version of the weakened rule later Thursday.


  Environmental and public health groups and Democratic lawmakers faulted the administration for pressing forward with rollbacks — in the final six months of President Donald Trump’s current term — while the coronavirus pandemic rivets the world’s attention.


  With rollbacks on air pollution protections, the “EPA is all but ensuring that higher levels of harmful air pollution will make it harder for people to recover in the long run” from the disease caused by the coronavirus, given the lasting harm the illness does to victims hearts and lungs, said Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

You may think of “fintech” as the province of small startups, and assume that any problems would have limited impact. But these technologies are in fact being contemplated (if not used already) by some of our largest, most established, financial institutions. Fidelity has a robo-adviser called Fidelity Go. JPMorgan has launched a “JPM Coin” for processing payments, and it runs on a distributed ledger. An important industry group called the International Swaps and Derivatives Association is actively exploring the possibility of “smart derivative contracts.” (Derivative contracts helped blow up the financial system in the last financial crisis.) And it’s not just the established _financial_ players—the tech giants are also eyeing these technologies as an entrée into the provision of financial services. Facebook, for example, wants to provide payment services to billions of people using the Libra currency, which relies on distributed ledger technology—although Facebook was recently forced to curtail its ambitions in light of political pressures.

 Without this, it would essentially be game over, collapse. We would be looking at many small, medium, and large corporations in bankruptcy. Many individuals would not be able to pay their bills, mortgages, and loans. Default rates and write-offs would skyrocket. Credit would freeze up. Demand for bonds and treasuries would collapse. There would be a domino effect like at no other time throughout history. It would be the demise of the Western world as we know it.
 Therefore, the Fed has no choice but to print countless trillions of dollars to fill all the enormous wholes in our fiat financial system. Also, it's not just the Fed. Other major central banks are diluting their respective money supplies to implement their own stimulus and bailout programs.
 ## Why This is Beneficial for Bitcoin
 Bitcoin and other capable and prominent digital assets represent alternative currency/payment systems. Unlike currencies in the financial fiat order, Bitcoin and other truly decentralized digital assets cannot be created, printed, or digitized limitlessly.
 There are only 21 million Bitcoin that can ever be mined. After that, that is it, no more Bitcoins can ever exist. This is true for many other decentralized, mineable coins. Once the limit is reached, there cannot be any more of that coin ever created. Moreover, the mining process becomes more difficult over time.
 This is very different from the fiat money central banks can dilute indefinitely. Right now, the U.S.'s monetary base is about $4 trillion, but once all of the recently announced QE and "emergency lending" is complete, the monetary base will likely be $10 trillion or more. Therefore, inflation, devaluation, and a possible loss in confidence are real issues to pay attention going forward.
 What will happen when people realize a gallon of milk costs twice as much in 2022 than it did in 2020, or that a loaf of bread costs $10 and not $5 a couple of years down the road? These are crude examples, but people all around the globe may start to realize that their fiat currencies are not as dependable as they once thought and are essentially just paper.

“We’re going to look at multiple positions throughout the rest of free agency and the draft," Douglas said, “and if there’s an opportunity for us to upgrade, I think we have the flexibility to do it.”


  Either an offensive lineman or wide receiver would be the likely choice with New York's first pick this year. And it all depends, of course, on who's still on the board.


  Douglas' goal entering the offseason was to improve the offensive line and add playmakers. The GM recently revealed to reporters he promised quarterback Sam Darnold's parents last summer that he'd help aid their son's progress by focusing on those areas. He started to fulfill that vow with some solid if not splashy moves in free agency.


  The O-line has lots of new faces with the additions of center Connor McGovern, tackle George Fant and guards Greg Van Roten and Josh Andrews. Left guard Alex Lewis was re-signed after he began last season as a backup before moving into a starting role.


  The Jets lost wide receiver Robby Anderson to Carolina, but Douglas quickly brought in a speedy replacement in Breshad Perriman.


  They also revamped the cornerback spot by cutting starters Trumaine Johnson and Darryl Roberts, and signing veteran Pierre Desir to help bolster one of New York's weakest spots.


  Douglas, in his first full offseason as GM, has a chance to make the Jets better — now and in the future — with eight scheduled draft picks, including four in the first three rounds. Here's a look at what they might do:


  BIG BOYS UP FRONT


  The Jets could have a completely different starting five on the offensive line than what they had in Week 1 of last season.


  Fant is the likely left tackle, with Chuma Edoga in the running to start on the right side. But, Fant could be switched to the other side if any of the top tackles — Iowa's Tristan Wirfs, Alabama's Jedrick Wills, Georgia’s Andrew Thomas or Louisville’s Mekhi Becton — are still on the board at No. 11.


  Any of those four would be considered a key building block on an offensive line charged with helping keep Darnold upright. USC's Austin Jackson could also be an option.

Sono convinta che anche in questo caso i condizionamenti culturali, ambientali, sociali abbiano un loro peso. Ma vi ricordo che, come è deleterio soffocare un sintomo fisico, così è deleterio soffocare una emozione: entrambi sono messaggi che il nostro corpo ci invia! Proviamo a pensare alla tristezza o alla delusione o alla frustrazione che, in particolari momenti della nostra vita, ci accompagnano e che quasi sempre sottovalutiamo o peggio soffochiamo. Forse ci stanno dicendo che è arrivato il momento di lasciarci andare e di abbandonarci senza timore al dolore, al pianto, dando libero sfogo a sentimenti da troppo tempo repressi. Piangere è sicuramente un atto liberatorio perchè le lacrime sono “il fiume della vita che allontana il vecchio per lasciare posto al nuovo”. Forse ci stanno dicendo che è arrivato il momento di cambiare!!

Note that in March, the well produced a partial month while the offset well was completed. This should be a red flag to begin with, as Chesapeake was clearly anticipating immediate impact from the offset completion. Notice then, the impact from the BB 2-35-71 20H. In February, the last full-month before the completion, the well made 11,776 BO, 20,101 MCF, and 6,463 BW. In April, the first full month after the BB 2-35-71 20H was completed, the water volume spiked to 13,711 BW for the month - more than double. The oil volume cratered to 6,370 BO for the month - nearly half, and only recovered to 7,809 the next month in May. The gas cratered even further, down to 4,630 MCF in April and recovering in June to 7,664 MCF, still nearly a third of the pre-offset completion rate.
 Those are astonishing, immediate impacts, and they only applied to one half of the lateral, as both wells had the first half of their laterals not interfering with any offset wells at the time!
 That is very compelling evidence. Further evidence is the terrible performance of the 2-35-71 20H and 2-35 71 18H, as both have close offsets and were clearly in the drainage of the 25-35-71 21H.
 The final piece of evidence is the 2-35-71 16H. It, again, is far and away the best well of the three in the 11/14 DSU. This can be explained because:
     1. It is a full mile away from the BB 25-35-71 21H, and thus outside of its drainage area, with which that well had been draining for 7 months before the 11/14 DSU was drilled.     2. There are no offsets in the Turner to the west of the 16H. Therefore, it is only interfering with the wells to its east, which, as shown, had already been partially depleted and are poorer producers anyway.
 ## Lesson Conclusion
 As of the release of the 2Q report in August of 2019, "Micro" investors could have reviewed the highlighted data that Chesapeake shared with the BB pad. In so doing, their investigation and vetting would show that the spacing density that Chesapeake had been developing their Turner position with, with up to 5 rigs running in the play at a time, had serious interference problems. Indeed, the very wells in the same DSU as their chosen well to highlight were so impacted by interference, that they would never come anywhere close to paying out their investment in a $60 oil price environment, let alone the $50 environment seen in that time span. Further review of Chesapeake wells in the area would show that they had been drilling dozens of these wells, with similar interference impacts, raising a big red flag about the economic prospects for Chesapeake's oil program in the Powder.

The Scotland international missed last weekend's 0-0 draw with Liverpool but is contention to face Ronald Koeman's men after returning to training earlier this week.


  However, assistant manager Steve Agnew reveals there is no guarantee wing- back Robertson will play after replacement Robbie Brady put in a fine performance at Anfield, prompting manager Steve Bruce to suggest he would be selected again this week.


  "We'll discuss that [team selection] today," Agnew said. "It's a dilemma because Andrew has done so well since coming down from Scotland and really hit the ground running.


  "But then Robbie came in last weekend and performed exceptionally well at Liverpool. It's a great problem to have."


  Agnew also confirmed that injured quartet Allan McGregor, Steve Harper, Nikica Jelavic and Michael Dawson are all progressing well and could return for the Premier League clash with Tottenham after the international break later this month.


  Meanwhile, Agnew insists close-season signing Tom Ince still has a big future at the club despite being shipped out on loan to Nottingham Forest.


  Ince has struggled to make an impact at the KC Stadium and, after missing several matchday squads, Bruce allowed the winger to leave on a temporary basis.


  "Tom came in pre-season and did ever so well when started the season with us," he added.


  "We changed the shape of the team and then one or two players came in or out and Tom was one of those.


  "We felt he hasn't played as much football as we would have liked so Steve agreed with Nottingham Forest to take him on loan until January.


  "Hopefully he'll get some games in, perform like we know he can and it will be beneficial to all of us.


  "He is a top player, an exciting player and one we're looking forward to working with for a good number of years."

Never much of a fundraiser, Biden struggled for cash at times in 2019 and early this year, and though more funds flowed into his campaign when he started winning primaries in February, even that has slowed amid the economic squeeze of the COVID-19 crisis, according to people briefed on the campaign’s finances. O’Malley Dillon knows what it’s like to run a campaign tight on money after managing Beto O’Rourke’s failed effort last year, but cash is nonetheless necessary for Biden to scale up to general election size, even if it’s not very expensive for him to run a campaign now, without travel and television ads. The party’s recent decision to delay the convention until August only adds to the looming worry: Biden won’t be able to touch money his donors have earmarked for the general election until then. For now, big cash injections have been far and few between, with Biden unable to hold in-person events, and only occasionally dropping into the replacement virtual fundraisers his team has managed to schedule. Instead, top aides and allies like former Virginia governor and DNC chairman Terry McAuliffe have been keeping in touch with donors over Zoom to keep them in the loop on the campaign while they wait for the economic picture to brighten slightly.

The close-season arrival of Colombia star Rodriguez at the Santiago Bernabeu was expected to push Isco further down Carlo Ancelotti's attacking pecking order.


  However, the former Malaga playmaker has been in superb form for Real recently after coming in for the injured Gareth Bale, earning widespread plaudits for excellent displays in Real's wins over Liverpool and Barcelona in the last week.


  And Rodriguez has revealed that he was not expecting to be so impressed by Isco's ability.


  When asked in an interview with Spanish radio station _Cadena Ser_ which of his new team-mates has most surprised him, Rodriguez replied: "All of them have a lot of quality. Maybe the one that has surprised me the most is Isco - I like him a lot."


  Rodriguez is also now showing his true quality after a period of adaption at the Bernabeu, and the World Cup golden boot winner insists he was always confident of succeeding in the Spanish capital.


  The 23-year-old was often substituted or omitted from Real's starting line-up at the start of the season, but has now seemingly cemented his place in Ancelotti first-choice XI and is happy playing wherever the Italian wants him to.


  "I was calm, I knew that I had to adapt but through working hard I could raise my level and I know that I can still improve," Rodriguez added.


  "I will always be available. Without doubt, I like to play as a playmaker, close to the area.


  "[But] from the centre of midfield to up front, I have played in all those positions."

Therefore, with the difficult times and the importance of being as informed as ever before choosing to invest in the shale patch now, be it in a company that will weather the storm, or in a company that is exiting out of bankruptcy with a more manageable situation, I'd like to suggest and share how to delve into the Micro side, in order to have a complete picture and data set with which to drive investment decisions.
 ## Macro vs. Micro
 What is Macro and Micro, then, in regard to a specific company?
 I define Macro as the big-picture items, what the casual investor/news reader will see. This includes press releases, presentations, quarterly and annual reports, etc. This information is indeed quite important. Combined, they allow for the investor to scrutinize financials, be kept abreast of major developments, delve into the overarching strategy and performance of a company. In practice, Macro data is typically lagging, and thus, to the investor, is reactionary by nature.
 I define Micro as the well, field, and play level results of a company. These are the results that, when combined, make up the Macro items, or at least should in theory. Studying the micro results of a specific well, especially one that is mentioned in the Macro material that companies provide to the public, can inform you beyond what the companies want to tell you, beyond the hype. This can work in your favor in multiple ways as an investor. In practice, though micro data is lagging in nature due to delays in reporting and posting to public databases, the amount of lag is considerably less than that of Macro data, and, more importantly, it can be tracked and digested whether the company wants to focus on it or not. In essence, this data allows the investor to vet a company's performance at any time, be it prior to, during, or after a company focuses (or ignores) it.
 In difficult times such as these, it is very important to vet what companies are telling you with their Macro data. It allows you to reduce risk in investing.

The Trump administration is expected on Thursday to weaken regulations on the release of mercury and other toxic metals from oil and coal-fired power plants, another step toward rolling back health protections in the middle of a pandemic.
   
 The final Environmental Protection Agency rule does not eliminate restrictions on the release of mercury, a heavy metal linked to brain damage. Environmental lawyers said the new method of calculating the costs and benefits of curbing mercury pollution would most likely destroy the legal underpinnings of controls on mercury and many other pollutants.
   
 By reducing the health benefit of regulations on paper, while raising their economic costs, the new method could be used to justify loosening restrictions on any pollutant that the fossil fuel industry has deemed too costly to control.

High-flying Guimaraes were routed 4-0 by Maritimo last week but Jonathan Alvez's brace and a penalty from Andre Andre saw the hosts end their three- game winless streak.


  Guimaraes are second in the table with 14 points from seven matches, two adrift of league leaders Benfica.


  Boavista have seven points from as many games in 2014-15.


  With the first half seemingly set to end all-square, Uruguayan striker Alvez - on loan from Torque - was on hand to side-foot Guimaraes into a 44th-minute lead.


  Guimaraes' hopes were boosted eight minutes after the break, when Boavista's Philipe received his marching orders for a second bookable offence.


  Boavista's woes were compounded in the 69th minute as referee Artur Soares Dias pointed to the spot following Joao Dias' foul on Bernard Mensah.


  Andre made no mistake, sending Boavista goalkeeper Mika the wrong way.


  And Alvez made sure of the points five minutes from time, winning the ball on the halfway line before powering towards goal and firing into the roof of the net.

Mourinho's Chelsea side will take on Van Gaal's Manchester United team in the Premier League at Old Trafford on Sunday.


  Robben was brought to Chelsea by Mourinho in his first spell at Stamford Bridge before playing under Van Gaal at Bayern Munich and later with the Netherlands national side.


  Van Gaal and Mourinho - who worked together while the Dutchman was in charge at Barcelona - will lock horns at Old Trafford on Sunday and Robben believes there are parallels to be drawn between the experienced duo.


  "They are both very demanding, really intense and what they ask from their players is the same kind of intensity," the Bayern winger told _The Telegraph_.


  "They are the same in the way they prepare things, the way they live and breathe football and tactics every second of the day almost.


  "When I came to Chelsea and worked with Mourinho, it was my first time abroad, so that was an important stage for me.


  "But I have also worked under Van Gaal, and now [Pep] Guardiola and I feel so privileged to have worked for these great coaches because it has certainly helped me make good steps in my career."


  Robben enjoyed a hugely successful time at Chelsea under Mourinho - winning two Premier League titles and an FA Cup before making the move to Real Madrid.


  After two years at Real, where he won just one league title during a disappointing spell, Van Gaal helped him rediscover form at Bayern to the point where he is now one of the finest players in the world.


  The 30-year-old revealed there were certain differences between the two as well, with Mourinho placing more of an emphasis on collective efforts.


  "Mourinho was always very strong for his players and you needed to deliver for him.focus on collective strength," he added.


  "For me, it was good. It was also very special because, in my first year, we won the league, Chelsea's first in 50 years, and that was important for everybody at the club. But for me the big thing I learnt from Mourinho was about mentality.


  "He taught us to be strong, collectively, and also strong for yourself.


  "Van Gaal is the kind of guy who can really make individual players better. It was the most important step of my career to go from Real Madrid to Bayern. It was the best move of my career, coming here and working under him.


  "It really gave me a lot of confidence and a new way of working."

"Al San Paolo di Civitavecchia abbiamo avuto uno dei primi due focolai contemporaneo a quello della RSA Madonna del Rosario che ci ha messo a dura prova. Ora, da qualche giorno, non ci sono più riscontri di positivi tra il personale del San Paolo che è stato sottoposto a tampone per il 94%. Il personale positivo anche asintomatico è stato messo in isolamento a casa, mentre a quello negativo è stata data la disponibilità di alloggiare presso un albergo di Civitavecchia dove viene offerto vitto e alloggio. La Asl con tutte le procedure possibili ha reclutato nuovi infermieri e nuovi medici per far fronte all'emergenza di carenza del personale. Al Padre Pio si sono verificati 4 casi di positività tra gli infermieri del blocco operatorio. Tutti stanno bene di salute, sono asintomatici, ed è da dire che grazie ai tamponi che stiamo effettuando su tutto il personale si è avuto modo di scoprire la positività anche in casi che non presentavano alcun sintomo. La sanificazione procede da tempo regolarmente, così come al San Paolo, e in data odierna avverrà un sopralluogo da parte dei vigili del fuoco su richiesta della Asl per una ulteriore sanificazione delle sale operatorie. E' importante ricordare un concetto fondamentale ai nostri cittadini: non si muore solo di Coronavirus, vi sono patologie molto gravi per le quali si continua a morire. Non abbiate paura di recarvi al Pronto Soccorso se state male, i medici vi salvano la vita, e non si deve temere di affidarsi alle cure dei nostri ospedali per le patologie gravi di cui purtroppo si continua a morire.

Henry is out of contract at the end of the campaign and speculation is rife that the 37-year-old captain will call time on his professional career.


  New York's head of global football, Gerard Houllier, hinted on Thursday that Henry will not return to the Red Bulls next season after four years in the United States.


  Henry was noncommittal on the issue when quizzed about Houllier's comments on Friday.


  Petke, however, is unaware of Henry's intentions as the Red Bulls prepare to face Houston Dynamo on Saturday.


  "I've said it all along, my understanding, and it's a fact that nobody knows what Thierry is going to do," Petke told reporters on Friday.


  "Thierry's going to make that decision and announce that or don't announce that whenever he feels comfortable with. I have not got that indication one way or the other.


  "Thierry's focusing on every game and he's been a professional about it, he doesn’t want to get wrapped up in that stuff.


  "Like I said, he will let the world know if he chooses to when he wants to."


  Petke added: "Listen, Gerard is in France or Austria right now so I can't speak for what Gerard said.


  "All I can speak for is what I'm saying and that is I have zero idea and I believe that nobody has an idea.


  "Like I said, I'm the coach of this team, I have people above me that speak with Austria and speak with the global.


  "I don't, so perhaps there could be conversations, but you'd have to ask somebody else.


  "To me, it's just about what's on the field and getting ready for the game and focusing on that."

"La notizia che il nuovo riparto nazionale sia sceso da quasi 82 a 65 milioni di euro e che quindi non permetterà di soddisfare tutte le richieste di cassa integrazione in deroga già presentate né, tantomeno, quelle che stanno ancora arrivando, ci fa temere per l'occupazione e l'economia della nostra Regione. Siamo preoccupati per il sostentamento dei lavoratori, ma anche per le aziende che rischiano di dover tagliare l'occupazione prima della ripresa dell'attività". Lo dice Luca Maestripieri, segretario generale Ligure della Cisl.      "Dei fondi annunciati inizialmente - prosegue Maestripieri -, 4 milioni erano già stati trattenuti dal Ministero. Ora, secondo quanto ha comunicato il ministro del Lavoro Nunzia Catalfo alla Regione, ne saranno sottratti alla Liguria altri 13. Gran parte della cifra ad oggi concessa è già impegnata per le domande al momento presentate. Lo sforzo del sindacato è massimo per soddisfare tutte le richieste che ogni giorno arrivano a ritmo di centinaia al giorno, il che lascia intravedere un aumento ancora consistente delle domande. Capiamo che ci sono regioni focolaio che hanno bisogno di misure più consistenti di quelle già approvate ed è giusto che abbiano una cifra maggiore, ma non che questa vada sottratta ad un territorio martoriato come il nostro, messo già a dura prova dal crollo del ponte. Il Governo si era impegnato a trovare le risorse per coprire una situazione drammatica per le imprese del nostro territorio, ora deve reperirle e metterle a disposizione come si era impegnato a fare".      "Genova e la Liguria sono in grave difficoltà per una serie di eventi pregressi che l'Esecutivo non può ignorare - conclude il segretario generale Cisl Liguria -. Tagliare ora i fondi per la cassa integrazione in deroga significherebbe lasciar morire un gran numero di aziende e, con esse, centinaia di posti di lavoro. Un colpo che la Liguria non potrebbe sopportare".

APEJ is on track to grow by 46 basis points in 2027 over 2017 but this will still not be enough to dislodge North America from its pole position in the noise control system market.

"Questo fatto in sé è una forma di disinformazione", ha detto. "Abbiamo anche visto casi in cui la Russia ha consegnato merci alle nazioni europee, e ci sono stati molti articoli di stampa che dimostrano che tali prodotti sono difettosi", ha aggiunto. "Ciò che dobbiamo ai nostri cittadini è garantire che diciamo la verità. E parte di una campagna di disinformazione inizia con la fiducia e la fiducia che i cittadini hanno in ciò che trasmetti. E vogliamo assicurarci di continuare a rimanere fedeli ai nostri valori democratici", ha spiegato. Wolters ha inoltre aggiunto di rimanere "molto, molto concentrato" sulle transazioni di materiale che ci sono state dalla Russia all'Italia e di esserne a conoscenza. "Sono a conoscenza di tali transazioni. È preoccupante. Presto molta attenzione all'influenza russa. E dobbiamo assicurarci di avere tutti i fatti. È una preoccupazione. Rimaniamo molto, molto vigili nella Nato rispetto a tali transazioni e continuiamo a monitorare al massimo grado", ha spiegato. (segue) (Beb)

Henderson struck his first goal of the season to earn all three points at Anfield on Saturday as Liverpool moved into sixth place in the Premier League.


  Having combined with Adam Lallana for the opening goal, the 24-year-old slid home the winner on 61 minutes after good work from Raheem Sterling inside the penalty area.


  Rodgers was delighted to see the England midfielder cap an impressive performance with the decisive goal, citing the former Sunderland man's newfound freedom to break on as crucial.


  "We gave him more licence [to get forward]," Rodgers said.


  "He's the one player in the country who can dominate the game without the football with his running capacity, his great physicality and today was about getting him forward that bit more.


  "That running allows him to offer the combination with Adam for the first goal and the second he arrives in the box and finishes really, really well. It was a big performance from him today.


  "He has wonderful physical capacity to run. His size surprises a lot of people, he's got great running ability [and] lovely technique on the ball."


  The Anfield manager admitted there were still improvements needed from his side over the coming weeks, but expressed encouragement at their determination to come back and seal victory.


  "Performance wise we've still got a way to go," he added. "The speed of our game, movement in our game [and] intensity in our game is still developing and improving.


  "I'd rather have that now and get better and better as the season goes on, but whilst searching it is important to find a way to win.


  "The players have got remarkable character. It was a very important win for us today, hopefully we'll come back from the international break to what we were at Tottenham with a full squad to pick from."

The Third Red Scare has served to marginalize legitimate critiques of the neoliberal establishment and hamstring the agenda of progressives. The reality is that Sanders’ agenda is not even radical. In fact, it is in line with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Second Bill of Rights proposal (constitutional right to employment, food, clothing, leisure, fair income, freedom from unfair competition and monopolies for farmers, housing, medical care, social security, and education). So, like FDR, Sanders is more of a New Deal Democrat, not a socialist or communist, simply as a matter of historical fact. Furthermore, the U.S. is unique in its derision for socialism. Most of the rest of the world has socialist policies and parties. Nonetheless, the seemingly endless propagation of the Russian interference and Red Scare narratives continue to inflict damage upon and hamper democratic populist politicians and movements.

  Paper is going out the door via courier faster than ever, Gabel and Higgins agreed.


  The packaged lessons are also likely to contain ideas from educators for breathing and calming exercises, things to help youngsters better deal with stress, Gabel said.


  “That’s something we might have seen once in a while and now it’s a lot. And a lot of the teachers are doing communications things, like postcards to students.”


  Having a dedicated print shop is unusual for a school district these days, Higgins said, and having Gabel run it is gravy.


  She’s an excellent self-manager, with a zest for helping teachers teach, he said.


  “Kelly has been able to build confidence in the print shop. She’s been here long enough to build relationships,” he said, noting Gabel also connects well with vendors and administrators.


  “She can relate to people. That’s always been one of her strong points. ‘How can we serve you?’ That’s critical.”


  It would have cost less to send links to parents to have them print off lessons at home for their own students, Higgins said.


  “But it would be so much more expensive for families. And a lot of people have gone away from having a personal printer at home.”


  It’s been district Superintendent Wade Smith’s mission right from the first COVID-19 plan to ensure equity for all students. For grade-school kids, paper packets put everyone on the same education footing, whatever technology they do or don’t have at home, Higgins said.


  “This removes barriers,” he said.

In less than half an hour from the harbor, we spot our first whales spouting maybe 50 yards away. Our main guide, Mario Escalera, who has a master’s degree in marine biology and knows these whales intimately, advises us that our boat will stay far enough from the whales to avoid stressing them, but it will be OK if whales approach us on their own. Several of us have heard stories and seen videos about whales coming so close to boats that the passengers can touch them, and we’re hoping to experience that phenomenon, too.


  During our two-hour outing, the first of four during our three-day stay, we excitedly shift our gaze (and cameras) from one side to the other as someone softly shouts, “Whales at two o’clock. Another one at nine o’clock!” Several times we encounter a scaly backed whale that emerges from the murky water like a shadowy apparition not far away. After expelling a burst of air, the mottled snout and crusty back slip down into the water.


  After a dozen or more encounters, it’s time for lunch and settling into our tent camp that Sea Kayak Adventures has set up along the shores of a remote, sandy peninsula. By camping here, we have saved an hour of travel. This location puts us near the middle of the whales’ protected playground and their access point to the open ocean via a channel called la boca (“the mouth”).


  Between whale watching excursions, we take leisurely walks along the beach and a guided hike through the Sahara-like sand dunes behind our camp. At mealtime we sit at the long picnic table by the water, always scanning the bay for telltale whale spouts while we enjoy the delicious meals that magically appear from the cook’s small tent. Happy-hour drinks, fresh fish and vegetables and homemade tiramisu make our first dinner a delight.

So let me start with that related to the de-risking, risking. And I'm going to have Rob Kapito talk about this too because he's on the frontline of this. Obviously we had vast de-risking from February 21st to the end of the quarter. And much of it was done using indexed products to go in and out of the marketplaces. But our conversations have been very broad in terms of what our clients are going to start inching back into the marketplace. So we had a recent call in the month of April with 750 institutional clients and 75% of that group expressed plans to actively take on more risks and by -- start beginning to buy in dips, while only 5% expressed that they are taking risk off the table. And we're seeing this across the board in our illiquid alternative space. We are actually having deeper, longer, broader dialogues than ever before. Clients are looking -- continue to looking for that. As we showed in sustainability issues, clients are just as interested today despite all the underpinnings of the global economies related to COVID-19. And so I would say, clients have done broad de-risking. They wanted to get their foundation in views. Some of them will be -- had already entered the market. Some of them are going to be waiting because they expect another dip and it really depends on the client's position. We actually have some clients who were needed to sell because of the decline in energy prices. And there are all many reasons where you had not just a de-risking but we have governments who need cash flow and need to spend on that. And so, that's also a thing that has, in my mind that drove -- as oil prices were being driven down, it obviously created an environment where those countries that have been benefiting from rising energy prices and stable energy prices, they were investing dollars and now there they’re into support their economy, they've done other things in terms of using some of their vast savings to support their own economy.

It has been a tough season and a bit for United as they struggled last term with David Moyes at the helm, while simultaneously watching Manchester City replace them as Premier League champions.


  The 2014-15 season has not seen as much as improvement as the Old Trafford faithful would have hoped for either, although new manager Louis van Gaal has inspired United to their current four-game unbeaten run, which sees them sit eighth in the standings.


  While Van Gaal's men remain four points adrift of City in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's Manchester derby, Robson believes the two sides are evenly matched - especially up front.


  "We've got some great players, the same as City as well. The forward players, [Angel] Di Maria, [Radamel] Falcao, [Robin] van Persie, [Wayne] Rooney, [Juan] Mata. There's a lot of pace and ability in there," Robson said.


  "But Manchester City are exactly the same, they've got some great players. [Sergio] Aguero for me is one of the best strikers in the world. Great player, and then you've got the power of [Yaya] Toure and the ability of Toure in the midfield area. So City have got some great players as well.


  "I think the only reason why United haven't got a few more points in the bag at this moment is because of all the injuries to the midfield players and defenders.


  "So hopefully when we get that back we'll get a little bit more consistency into the game and win a lot more games."


  While United remain a work in progress for Van Gaal, Robson claimed he saw enough in their 1-1 draw with leaders Chelsea last week to indicate they can take the game to City at Etihad Stadium.


  "It's one where as United you've got to be really strong and play with a bit of pace and if the lads can do that they proved against Chelsea they can get a result against the best teams," the former midfielder said.


  Robson still considers City favourites for the derby, however, although the 57-year-old is pleased with the stubbornness United have displayed over the past fortnight, scoring late equalisers against Chelsea and West Brom.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is gutting an Obama-era rule that compelled coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards, limiting future regulation of air pollutants by petroleum and coal plants.


  Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist whose clients have gotten many of the regulatory rollbacks they asked for from the Trump administration, was set to announce the final version of the weakened rule later Thursday.


  Environmental and public health groups and Democratic lawmakers faulted the administration for pressing forward with rollbacks — in the final six months of President Donald Trump’s current term — while the coronavirus pandemic rivets the world’s attention.


  With rollbacks on air pollution protections, the “EPA is all but ensuring that higher levels of harmful air pollution will make it harder for people to recover in the long run” from the disease caused by the coronavirus, given the lasting harm the illness does to victims hearts and lungs, said Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.


  The EPA left in place standards for emissions of mercury, which has been linked to brain damage and other ailments. But the agency was expected to whittle down the health benefits that regulators can consider in crafting rules, thus challenging the underlying basis for the 2011 Obama administration rule and others like it in the future.


  The Trump administration contends the mercury cleanup was not “appropriate and necessary,” a legal benchmark under the country’s landmark Clean Air Act, and began work in 2018 to roll back the regulation. It has said the change was needed to provide “regulatory certainty” and more precisely calculates the public health benefit of the rule.
