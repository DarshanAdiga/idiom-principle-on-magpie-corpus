 Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!
 Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.
 Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.
 Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.
 You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.
 You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.
 If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.

The Patriots run game suffered last season when the team lost fullback James Develin and his backup, Jakob Johnson, to injury. It appears the Patriots could be in the process of providing even more depth to the fullback position.
   
 According to a source, the Pats are one of a handful of teams to have shown interest in Dan Vitale, a veteran fullback of four NFL seasons. Vitale, 26, spent the past two seasons in Green Bay and the previous two in Cleveland. Last season, was Vitale's most productive in the NFL. He caught a career-high seven passes for 97 receiving yards.
   
 The Patriots had interest in Vitale prior to the 2016 NFL Draft. They met with the fullback at the NFL Combine and Nick Caserio also went to Vitale's Northwestern Pro Day. Vitale was eventually drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round. He started his career on the Bucs practice squad before signing with the Browns active roster. After being released in 2018, Vitale signed with the Packers practice squad. He ended up appearing five games with Green Bay that season.
   
 If the Patriots are worried about the healthy of Develin, who suffered a season-ending neck injury last season, they could very well bring in someone like Vitale.

Later at the briefing, Trump said he had actually activated the measure Thursday night. He declined to reveal any companies he had ordered to step up production, though, and then walked back his claim, saying, “You know, so far, we haven't had to” because companies are volunteering.
 The president and the Cabinet officials who briefed reporters focused on the border as they moved to restrict the entry of people without documentation. This follows a stepped-up State Department travel advisory telling Americans they should not leave the country.
 On another front, Trump said the Education Department will not enforce standardized testing requirements for students in elementary through high school for the current year. Under federal education law, states are required to administer standardized tests every school year.
 “Americans from every walk of life are coming together,” Trump said. “We are winning and we are going to win this war.”
 The administration is trying to overcome its inability to provide the needed masks, ventilators and other supplies to hospitals on the verge of being overwhelmed by coronavirus patients. Already doctors and nurses have been making desperate public pleas. And numerous local officials, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, have warned that their medical facilities will shortly run out of vital supplies, endangering both patients and health care workers.
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been working toward an aid package to prop up households and the U.S. economy that would put money directly into Americans' pockets. The president has embraced the stimulus, believing it is needed to stabilize the economy and stock markets, which have been pummeled by the crisis.
 Mere weeks ago, Trump expected to be campaigning for reelection on the strength of a robust economy and now the nation is staring at a recession, if not worse — a difficult hand for any incumbent to play.
 According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

She was a kind and gentle woman as ever lived. Strangers would approach her to strike up conversations as though they knew her for years and she would treat them as long lost friends.

It was the onset of dementia that robbed her of a lifetime of memories, worse than any physical ailment. She was and will always be \"The Girl Next Door\".

Bruce Weber added to the highest-rated recruiting class in his eight-year Kansas State coaching tenure on Thursday evening when power forward Seryee Lewis announced in a video on his Twitter account that he was "110% committed" to the Wildcats.
   
 Lewis, a 6-foot-9, 211-pounder from Chicago, spent the past season at Compass Prep in Chandler, Arizona, where he averaged 17 points and 9.0 rebounds per game. Both Rivals and 247Sports recruiting services rated him a three-star prospect and 247Sports ranks him at No. 282 overall nationally in the 2020 recruiting class.
   
 Lewis joins a K-State class boasting four top-150 high school recruits that signed in November, and 6-10 UTEP transfer Kaosi Ezeagu, who joined the team at semester and will be eligible for the 2021 spring semester.
   
 The decision by post players James Love and Nigel Shadd last week to enter the transfer portal, left room for Lewis on the roster. With the addition of Lewis, the Wildcats now are at the 13-man NCAA limit, barring any further defections.
   
 K-State had been in contact with Lewis since last year's Peach Jam showcase but just recently offered a scholarship.
   
 "Coach Weber and the staff always promoted that I was the missing piece in their incoming 2020 class, and if I was to make the move to the school we'll be the new Fab Five, and that sounded good to me and my family," Lewis told Stockrisers.com, a high school basketball web site.
   
 Though the current coronavirus restrictions kept him from making an official recruiting visit to K-State, his friendship with fellow Chicago native and current Wildcat freshman guard DaJuan Gordon helped convince him that it was the right choice. He also had offers from Georgetown, Saint Louis and Southern Illinois, as well as several Ivy League schools.
   
 K-State's 2020 recruiting class, easily the most decorated of Weber's K-State tenure, is ranked currently is ranked No. 14 nationally, fourth in the Big 12, by Rivals and No. 21 nationally with a No. 5 conference rating by 247Sports.
   
 The early signees included 6-foot point guard Nijel Pack from Indianapolis and 6-4 shooting guard Selton Miguel from Orlando, Florida, along with a pair of St. Louis standouts in 7-footer Davion Bradford and 6-5 shooting guard Luke Kasubke.
   
 Rivals and 247Sports both gave Pack four stars, while Miguel and Bradford also received four-star rankings from Rivals.

Health officials said Thursday that a 47-year-old Pueblo County woman has tested positive for COVID-19. She is Pueblo County's second confirmed case in less than a week.
   
 The Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment said an epidemiologist is currently conducting an investigation. People will be contacted if they are suspect to have had contact with the individual in question.
   
 The announcement came as a mobile testing unit was underway at the Colorado State Fairgrounds. There were 100 tests available Thursday.
   
 "That's 100 more than what we have tested previously. We certainly have testing going on, but this will add 100 more. It gives us some surveillance of our community and will help us really understand what the prevalence is in our community," said Randy Evetts, the health director of the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment.
   
 "This will allow us to make other decisions about strategies about other work we need to do in the community. It will help to inform our elected officials about their strategies as well."
   
 A long line of vehicles streamed in and out of the testing zone. The process took about 5 minutes for each person. They were swabbed and their test kids were sent to the state.
   
 "Their test may come back as soon as Monday, but that will depend on the volume of other testing in the cue " Evetts said.
   
 The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment provided the lab for the testing, which got underway at the Colorado State Fairgrounds at 10 a.m.
   
 Members of the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, the U.S. National Guard, the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office, the Colorado State Patrol and the Pueblo Police Department also coordinated the event.
   
 Members of the National Guard conducted the testing in full hazmat suits and masks.
   
 The local health department has been working with physicians and the local medical community to identify the individuals in the Pueblo area who have the most critical need to get tested.
   
 Only those who had a prescription from their health care provider were ale to participate in the tests.
   
 "I think the fact that we needed to get a broader test base here in Pueblo was a concern to me and when we talked with the Colorado Department of Health and Environment, they agreed with us," said state Rep. Daneya Esgar, D-Pueblo.
   
 Esgar was instrumental in bringing mobile testing to Pueblo County.
   
 "I think this is going to be so important for us to get a pulse of what is happening in Pueblo and we don't have that without a larger number of tests happening," Esgar said.
   
 "And getting this testing is going to tell us there's more than what we expected or there's less than we expected, but at least it will give us answers. We have uncertainty right now and I think this is beneficial and helpful right now."
   
 Evetts said more testing is being planned.
   
 "This is a start. We have plans to do more; we just do not have it all together yet," Evetts said.
   
 Evetts said as the pandemic continues to change daily, there are no plans in place for the community to be ordered to remain in their homes.
   
 "At any time things can change. This is evolving quickly and we are getting new directives every day. As the information changes that could be on the table, but it is not on the table at this point" he said.
   
 Evetts said as of right now, Pueblo health facilities have equipment they need in place.
   
 "We've got additional orders placed for the future and we are just going to have to play it day by day,"Evetts said.
   
 Mayor Nick Gradisar said citizens need to treat everyone as if he or she has the virus. He urged citizens to take precautions.
   
 "We don't know who has it. It is contagious and it's something that can hurt people and cause even death for people who are at risk," Evetts said.
   
 "We need to err on the side of safety."
   
 Esgar said especially since there is a new case in Pueblo County, that local citizens -- if they haven't already -- need to realize that the situation is real.
   
 "This is happening. If they really take the precautions people have been asking them to take -- stay home; if you're sick, quarantine yourself for 14 days; stay away from people if you can; and try to do work from home if you can -- I think we are going to pull through this together," Esgar said.
   
 Evett said it has been exhausting for the local health agencies, but Pueblo is as prepared as any other community.
   
 "That is why we have opened up and gone into unified command with the Emergency Operations Center. Sheriff (Kirk) Taylor and his team have been absolutely professional and have been willing to help us with whatever we need," Evetts said.
   
 "We have the resources and we have the training in our community and we have the ability to continue to ramp up."

The spread of Covid-19 has reached a critical phase and is having an increasingly significant impact on economic activity. The Basel III standards have strengthened the resilience of the banking system over the past decade. The global banking system has significantly higher levels of capital and liquidity, and is therefore in a stronger position to absorb shocks and mitigate interruptions to banking services. Banks and supervisors must remain vigilant in light of the evolving nature of Covid-19 to ensure that the global banking system remains financially and operationally resilient.

GALESBURG - Leah Behrens, 65, died peacefully at her sister's home on March 16, 2020 after a short but courageous battle with cancer.   Born in Fort Carson, Colorado, Leah traveled the world with her parents and four siblings until her father passed away while serving in the military, then settled in Galesburg, where Leah spent the remainder of her life.   Leah above all things cherished family. She worked just short of 30 years at United Facilities before retiring at the age of 63. At the end of the day though, home was where her heart was. She enjoyed cooking and baking for her family and friends and keeping a close eye on the "goings on" in the neighborhood.   Never married, and with no children of her own, Leah devoted her life to caring for her nephew, Keegan; her niece, Kaelyn; along with younger members of the family as though they were her own. Leah is also survived by two sisters, Diana Smith and her daughter, April, and Nancy (Roger) Fones and their children, Nick and Justin, both of Galesburg; and two brothers, Gary (Kathleen) Reagen of Plymouth, Minnesota and their children, Nate and Josh, and Marvin Behrens III of Galesburg, and his children, Jay and Reagan. Leah was preceded in death by her parents, Marvin Behrens and Mildred (Mehaffey) Godsil; and a stepbrother, Pat Godsil.   She was as stubborn as she was loving. With a stern look and a sideways glance, she could almost always encourage the people she cared about to "do the right thing." No one could mention being in need within earshot of Leah, and if they did, she went above and beyond to make sure no one went without. She was giving to a fault, and every breath she took was to better the lives of those she loved. The family would like to thank Hospice Compassus for their loving care.   Cremation will be accorded. Private family services are postponed until this summer. Arrangements have been entrusted to Watson Thomas Funeral Home and Crematory in Galesburg. Memorials may be made in Leah's memory to

As it responds to the coronavirus crisis, the University of Rhode Island has announced that face-to-face spring semester classes have been suspended that the classes will continue remotely at all campuses. The university said Thursday that all experiential learning students should continue to follow the guidance of their college, supervisor, or employer regarding their internship or clinical work.
 Graduate and faculty research should continue as usual both on and off campus while following guidance on social distancing and large gatherings, URI said. The faculty will have the discretion to make decisions on the continuation of graduate research they oversee.
 Thesis and dissertation defenses can be done remotely and be limited to the student and committee in attendance, URI said.
 The university also said that an update will be announce by noon Friday, March 20, on the "orderly cancellation of housing and dining, a schedule for removing personal items from undergraduate residence halls, and refunds that will be provided." Students have been told not to come to campus to remove personal items until further guidance is available.

  Springtime is here. It's the perfect time to take your fitness outdoors and enjoy a great season. And combining your cardio and muscle work makes it even better!


  Our move today is a side-to-side leaping lunge. This combination exercise will be accelerating your heart rate on the side-to-side jumping. And the lunging will be working your whole lower body, focusing on your glutes, hamstrings and quads. All you need for this movement is a clear area to move about. If you need intensity, small hand weights could be held as well.


  Begin this exercise by standing tall, and engaging your midsection for stability and balance. Start out by simply leaping out with a wide step on your left side, following with your right leg. Once you land on the ground with your left foot, carefully swing your right leg behind you (placing your foot steadily on the ground) and lower into a small lunging position.


  Now, from this lunge, you will repeat the same movement going in the opposite direction, leaping out to your right side, and following with the left leg. Position your trail leg behind you in a lunging position on the other side.


  You can start this combination exercise slowly in the beginning to ensure your balance. Once you get the momentum, slightly increase your speed. This will increase your heart rate, get your blood pumping and work your lower body a little harder.


  You can push yourself for a determined amount of time. Or give yourself at least 10 leaps on each side. Take a small break, and start the process over again.


  If at any time you need more intensity, you can hold small hand weights in each hand, tucking them into your chest. Or, if you need to lower the intensity, simply lose the leap and step out to your sides.


  Marlo Alleva, an instructor at Gold's Gym and group fitness coordinator at Fontaine-Gills YMCA in Lakeland, Florida, can be reached at faluvzpa@msn.com.

 The Patriots run game suffered last season when the team lost fullback James Develin and his backup, Jakob Johnson, to injury. It appears the Patriots could be in the process of providing even more depth to the fullback position.
 According to a source, the Pats are one of a handful of teams to have shown interest in Dan Vitale, a veteran fullback of four NFL seasons. Vitale, 26, spent the past two seasons in Green Bay and the previous two in Cleveland. Last season, was Vitale's most productive in the NFL. He caught a career-high seven passes for 97 receiving yards.
 The Patriots had interest in Vitale prior to the 2016 NFL Draft. They met with the fullback at the NFL Combine and Nick Caserio also went to Vitale's Northwestern Pro Day. Vitale was eventually drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the sixth round. He started his career on the Bucs practice squad before signing with the Browns active roster. After being released in 2018, Vitale signed with the Packers practice squad. He ended up appearing five games with Green Bay that season.
 If the Patriots are worried about the healthy of Develin, who suffered a season-ending neck injury last season, they could very well bring in someone like Vitale.

OTTAWA - The federal government unveiled historic new measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic on Friday, promising a sweeping revamp of the national industrial landscape while closing the country's doors to some who might once have been welcome.
 As the nationwide number of cases surpassed 1,000, the federal government announced it would be supporting businesses to shift their operations to focus on products needed to help combat the spread of the novel coronavirus. Previously announced measures to close the border with the United States will also be tightened even further, with Ottawa reversing a decision to isolate some would-be asylum seekers and opting to bar them entry instead.
 "We recognize that the efforts we are going through are unprecedented," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference outside his home, where he's been in self-isolation for a week. "These are historic times in which we need to do everything we can to support Canadians and mobilize all our efforts in smart ways."
 Trudeau, who has long been emphasizing the need for personal actions to curb the spread of the illness, shifted his focus to the corporate realm with word of financial incentives for companies that join the fight against the global pandemic.
 Government cash will be available to businesses that shift their practices to produce more goods needed for the ongoing COVID-19 containment effort, Trudeau said, such as auto parts manufacturers who switch gears to make badly needed medical supplies. Businesses already producing items such as masks and hand sanitizer, he added, will also receive support as they ramp up their operations.
 Trudeau also announced a reversal of a previously announced measure related to the pending border closure with the United States, which was expected to go into effect late Friday.
 Rather than placing asylum seekers entering Canada on foot in isolation as previously announced, Trudeau said those "irregular" border-crossers would be treated the same as most other travellers and turned away at the border.
 Trudeau described the move as an exceptional, temporary measure to protect Canadians.
 The mutual agreement between Ottawa and Washington will see the border closed to all but trade and essential travel at 11:59 p.m. as both countries grapple with the COVID-19 outbreak.
 Thousands of people have been crossing into Canada from the U.S. using unofficial entry points to get around a deal that forbids people from lodging asylum claims at land border crossings.
 Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland called on Canadians to be patient as the government worked to enact the unprecedented new measures, saying Ottawa is departing from the norm by focusing on speed rather than perfection.
 Freeland also reflected on the impact the COVID-19 outbreak is having on society at large, saying even the youngest Canadians are struggling to come to grips with the surreal new norm that's shuttered everything from restaurants to schools over the past week.
 "Having a long school holiday may have seemed fun when it was first announced. But when it also includes learning that you can't have playdates, you can't spend time with your friends, it's really hard for our children," Freeland said.

For example, the recent and ongoing coronavirus outbreak has resulted in the extended closure of certain businesses in Asia, particularly in China, Europe and the United States as well as a decline in travel. The resulting economic and financial disruptions in the global economy could cause our customers or prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our products, lengthen sales cycles, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, the economies of countries in Europe have been experiencing weakness associated with high sovereign debt levels, weakness in the banking sector and uncertainty over the future of the European Union, including uncertainty regarding Brexit. We have operations, as well as current and potential new customers, throughout Europe. If economic conditions in Europe and other key markets for our platform continue to remain uncertain or deteriorate further, many customers may delay or reduce their information technology spending. The legal, regulatory and economic impacts of Brexit, which are not known at this time, may also, among other things, increase the costs and complexity of our operations in Europe including our ability to hire and retain employees.

To recap, where are we today is in the sharpest economic decline ever seen in US history – never before has the economy dropped off so sharply, so suddenly. I think this is akin to a consumer confidence crisis – it's essentially the consumer version of the 2008 financial crisis. Many service, leisure, travel, and other consumption businesses are seeing an unheard of drop-off in business – OpenTable data suggests down 50% for some restaurants, others are reporting drops of 90% or more. Data shared on Twitter recently suggests the largest uptick in layoffs since 9/11 – and likely to get worse. I would [liken] what we are experiencing to a National 9/11. It seems likely we see a similar amount of deaths in the U.S. until this hopefully gets under control (I don't say that lightly and pray for a better outcome, but as investors we have to go with the data).

She was a kind and gentle woman as ever lived. Strangers would approach her to strike up conversations as though they knew her for years and she would treat them as long lost friends. She never complained about the Rheumatoid Arthritis that attacked her joints for over thirty years.

For our Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), we measure stock-based compensation expense at fair-value using a Black-Scholes option- pricing model, at the commencement of each offering period and recognize the expense over that offering period, which is generally six months. The key assumptions used in the Black-Scholesoption-pricing model include a volatility assumption based on the historical volatility of our stock price and the risk-free rate assumption based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the commencement of the offering period or grant date. The dividend yield assumption is zero as we have not historically paid any dividends and do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Amidst the coronavirus chaos, many local Main Street businesses are still open to the public. Of course there are some businesses that have chosen to close temporarily, like The Vault, Vintage Chic and Rafaela’s Alterations, and the Mecca has been mandated to close their doors for the time being. Both Vintage Chic and Rafaela’s Alterations have posted notices on their doors to let customers know when they will reopen for business.
 However, other businesses such as Country Pleasures and Stafford’s, as well as many of the barber shops and beauty salons, are still in operation.
 Country Pleasures reports that their gun and ammunition sales have been good. The Main Street business said gun and ammo distributors are having trouble keeping up with the demand for guns. One of their distributors even reported they sold more than $100,000 in product within a 24-hour period.

Is it less crazy to yell at the TV if you know the people on it? My kids say ‘no.’”

“While we have not received direct orders from government agencies or regulators, we have made the proactive decision to modify our lobby services,” said First Federal marketing president Jim Williams on Thursday morning. “This decision was made to help support the nationwide efforts for social distancing to help prevent the continued spread of the COVID-19.”
 And while many local institutions are modifying the way they provide customer service, other local institutions are keeping their normal business procedures intact.
 “As of right now we’re not taking the actions of closing lobbies,” explained Mickey Schwarzbek, president/CEO of Sherwood State Bank. “It’s business as usual. Right now, our banking industry locally is as strong as it’s ever been.
 “At this point each bank can do as they choose to protect their customers and employees,” added Scwarzbek, when asked if there were any state or federal restrictions being put on local lenders. “We have talked immensely about what to do now and looking down the road and as of right now it’s business as usual with us offering full banking services.
 “Those involved in the decision realize that as a community we are in uncharted territory, but they know that together we can overcome any obstacle,” he added.
 “This outbreak is like nothing we have experienced in our lifetime,” explained Donald P. Hileman, First Federal CEO. “Businesses on both a national and local level, as well as the employees of those businesses, will likely feel the financial impact. We appreciate the assistance that the government has already committed to help individuals and businesses, and we anticipate we will see additional measures to protect the economy. As a community, it is important that we come together to support each other during this unprecedented time.”

Our international expansion has created and will create significant challenges for our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks in addition to those we already face in the United States. Because of our limited experience with international operations and developing and managing sales in international markets, our international expansion efforts may not be successful.

Third-party reseller customers comprise a significant portion of our revenue. In transactions with third-party reseller customers, we are only party to the transaction with the reseller and are not a party to the reseller's transaction with its customer, and we do not control the efforts of these resellers. They may elect not to renew their subscriptions with us or may elect to purchase significantly fewer licenses, which would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, if such third-party reseller customers merge or consolidate with other businesses, declare bankruptcy or depart from their respective industries, our business could be harmed. For example, consolidation among our third-party reseller customers may require us to renegotiate agreements on less favorable terms, including longer payment periods, or may lead to a termination of our agreements with these resellers. We may expend significant resources managing these relationships. Further, in some international markets, we grant certain reseller customers the exclusive right to sell our features. If those reseller customers to whom we have granted exclusive rights elect not to renew their subscriptions or to purchase significantly fewer licenses, then we may be unable to adequately address sales opportunities in that territory. If we are unable to maintain or replace our contractual relationships with our existing reseller customers, efficiently manage our relationships with them or establish new contractual relationships with other third parties, we may fail to retain customers or acquire potential new customers and may experience delays and increased costs in adding or replacing customers that were lost, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
