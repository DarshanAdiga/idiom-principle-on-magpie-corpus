The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register for Citizens, and the National Population Register (CAA-NRC-NPR henceforth) are set to dominate Uttarayan, one of Gujarat's most popular festivals, when the state hosts an international kite-flying contest. In Ahmedabad, members of civil society have distributed around 35,000 kites with anti-CAA-NRC-NPR slogans, primarily to the underprivileged. The kites carry slogans such as "Save Constitution, Save India" and "Hindu Muslim Bhai Bhai, CAA & NRC Bye Bye", and will be flown on Wednesday. Since Ahmedabad is the epicentre of the festival and "arbitrary imposition of Section 144 and rejection of applications for peaceful protests" are very common there, those behind the idea see this as an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone -- get more visibility during a high-profile event and circumvent the restrictions. "If it's not possible on the ground, we will take the protests to the skies," said a protester.

Met name rondom Concert at Sea was het bereik ‘enorm’, zegt gedeputeerde Jo- Annes de Bat. Hij is zeer tevreden over de campagne ‘Jouw leven in Zeeland’, die bedoeld is om mensen te interesseren voor een baan in Zeeland. Bezoekers van de drie evenementen konden op een makkelijke manier een video maken over hoe hún leven in Zeeland eruit zou zien en die delen via sociale media. Daar zijn ze dus massaal bekeken.

De campagne gaat dit jaar door. Vooral Concert at Sea, waar 51.000 bezoekers van buiten Zeeland komen, blijkt een zeer geschikt evenement. Bij de Kustmarathon werkte het minder, omdat er geen rustmomenten zijn. ,,Daardoor weten we waar we niet en wel moeten zijn.” aldus De Bat. Rescue Vlissingen 2020 lijkt hem ook een ideaal evenement.
