BOSTON (AP) — Jack Welch, who transformed General Electric into a highly profitable multinational conglomerate, has died. He was 84.His wife told CNBC that he died Sunday at his home, surrounded by his beloved family and his dogs. Suzy Welch said the cause of death was renal failure.Welch became one of the nation’s most well-known and highly regarded corporate leaders during his two decades as GE’s chairman and chief executive, from 1981 to 2001.Current GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp Jr. said in a statement that it was a sad day for the entire company family.“Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century,” Culp said. "He reshaped the face of our company and the business world. Jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him. When I last saw him, what I remember most vividly was when he asked me, ‘So how exactly are you running the company?’“Jack was still in it – committed to GE’s success. And to have Jack Welch ask me how I am running GE is pretty humbling.”Welch personified the so-called “cult of the CEO” during the late-1990s boom, when GE’s soaring stock price made it the most valuable company in the world.His results-driven management approach and hands-on style were credited with helping GE turn a financial corner, although some of the success came at the expense of thousands of employees who lost their jobs in Welch’s relentless efforts to cut costs and rid GE of unprofitable businesses.He was named “manager of the century” by Fortune magazine in 1999. His other nickname, “Neutron Jack” was earned for slashing tens of thousands of jobs, CNBC said.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. Gray Media Group, Inc. contributed to the report.

“As a county legislator, I worked to increase economic development and tourism throughout the county, held the line on taxes to make our region more affordable, fought for additional funding and resources to help stem the tide of the opioid epidemic and led the fight on public safety," he said. "Now, I’m running for state Senate to bring common-sense solutions to Albany and improve our quality of life for this generation and generations to come.”
 Skoufis said in January that he backed an amendment to the state's bail reform law that would allow judges to consider "dangerousness" in a ruling on pretrial detention — a change first proposed in November by two Republican state senators from the Mid-Hudson Valley — Sue Serino of Hyde Park and James Seward of Milford.
 The law, which took effect Jan. 1, did away with cash bail and pretrial detention for most suspects charged with misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies. Law-enforcement officials, prosecutors and Republicans have spent months raising red flags about the changes, and their criticism gained attention over the last week as courts across the state released people who would have remained behind bars under the old rules.
 In a January filing with the state Board of Elections, Skoufis had the largest campaign coffer of any state representative or other candidate for state office in the region, with $321,337.

Prices of the WTI edge higher after testing YTD lows near $43.50 Traders' mood improves on the back of OPEC+, rate cuts. OPEC+ meeting, API, EIA reports to drive sentiment this week. After recording fresh yearly lows in the $43.50 region, prices of the WTI have managed to regain some poise and retake the $46.00 mark and above, where are now looking to consolidate. WTI looks to OPEC+, coronavirus, Fed Prices of the West Texas Intermediate have rebounded of levels last seen in December 2018 in the $43.50 region amidst unremitting coronavirus fears, speculations of further easing by the Fed and the likelihood of some supportive announcement from the OPEC+ at its meeting later in the week. In fact, crude oil prices are trading on a positive tone and are following the rest of the risk-associated universe on Monday in response to rising bets on further reductions of interest rates by the Fed as soon as the March meeting in order to tackle the potential negative effects of the fast-spreading COVID-19 on the US economy. In addition, the renewed upbeat mood in prices follows rising hopes that the OPEC+ could announce an extension of the ongoing oil output cut deal and deeper output cuts at the march 5-6 meeting in Vienna. This view is now supported further after Russia said the country is willing to collaborate to stabilize the oil market. Later in the week, the usual weekly reports on the US crude oil supplies by the API and the EIA are due on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, while the OPEC+ 2-day event will kick in on Thursday.

 Las discusiones entre la Unión Europea (UE) y el Reino Unido sobre su futura relación comenzaron este lunes por la tarde en Bruselas con un encuentro entre el negociador europeo, Michel Barnier, y su par británico, David Frost, indicaron a la AFP fuentes europeas.
 “El encuentro está en curso”, afirmó una de estas fuentes. A continuación, la primera ronda de negociaciones, que se prolongará hasta el jueves, comenzará formalmente con un encuentro de los dos equipos negociadores.
 Tras la publicación la semana pasada de los mandatos de negociación de Londres y Bruselas, que ya dejaron relucir sus líneas rojas y sus profundas diferencias, la cuestión ahora es saber si es posible llegar a un terreno de entendimiento.
 Si no hay acuerdo, las consecuencias económicas serán importantes tanto para el Reino Unido como para el continente tras el final del período de transición, previsto hasta el 31 de diciembre.
 El gobierno británico de Boris Johnson fijó junio como plazo para realizar un primer balance de las negociaciones y amenazó con cerrar la puerta a partir de entonces si las discusiones se estancaban.
 “En cualquier negociación, siempre hay un poco de pose. Cada parte quiere presentar su posición lo más fuerte posible”, explica Fabien Zuleeg, del European Policy Centre (EPC).
 Para una fuente europea, la posición de Johnson es “un mensaje político destinado a su opinión pública en caso de que se pase mal”. “Pero sería irresponsable cerrar la puerta entonces, cuando se puede discutir hasta finales de año”, agregó.
 Las negociaciones se organizarán en torno a diez grupos temáticos (comercio, transporte, energía, condiciones de competencia, pesca, cooperación judicial, etc.) y tendrán lugar entre Londres y Bruselas, alternativamente, cada dos o tres semanas.
 \- “No hay plan B” -
 Visto el corto período de negociación, las discusiones se centrarán en tres puntos, los más sensibles que auguran acaloradas discusiones: acuerdo de libre comercio y condiciones de competencia, solución de diferendos y pesca.
 La UE no está dispuesta a regalar el acceso de su mercado de 440 millones de consumidores, advirtiendo que el acuerdo no será a “cualquier precio”.
 El acceso de los británicos a este mercado con condiciones de “cero cuotas, cero aranceles”, como propone la UE, estará condicionado al respeto de las normas europeas de trabajo, medio ambiente, fiscalidad y ayudas de Estado, para evitar la competencia desleal de su ex socio.
 Londres, que reivindica su libertad comercial tras el divorcio, reitera su rechazo a alinearse con las reglas europeas, pese a los temores del bloque sobre una eventual rebaja de los estándares actuales en estas áreas.
 Los británicos rechazan también que el Tribunal de Justicia de la UE desempeñe un papel en la resolución de los diferendos entre ambos, como quieren los europeos.
 La pesca es otro de los asuntos sensibles en la negociación. La UE, pero sobre todo algunos países como Francia, quieren que sus flotas sigan accediendo a las ricas aguas británicas, por lo que piden “un acceso recíproco” a Londres.
 La UE ya ha advertido que sin acuerdo sobre la pesca no habrá un acuerdo comercial global entre ambos.
 “Si Londres se mantiene en su línea, no puede haber acuerdo. El Brexit siempre fue una cuestión política, ideológica, pero no económica”, apunta Zuleeg, que duda sobre el alcance de la presión de los ambientes económicos sobre Johnson.
 Una fuente europea considera posible un eventual acuerdo, si sus condiciones no aparecen como “un ‘diktat’” europeo. “Solo hay un plan A y no hay un plan B”, ya que los británicos rechazan cualquier prórroga de las negociaciones, advierte.

In his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname "Neutron Jack," after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.

It was inevitable. The wrinkly, green 50-year-old star of The Mandalorian is finally a playable character in Star Wars Battlefront 2, sort of. While Disney is perhaps hesitant about letting DICE turn its cute baby alien into a killing machine, modder Nanobuds can afford to be less restrained.
 We first heard about the mod last year, when Nanobuds revealed they were working on the model, adding to a collection of mods that includes the extremely cool cyborg Darth Maul and an intimidating battle damaged Darth Vader. It was finished last week, so you can take it for a spin now.
 Baby Yoda replaces BB-8, one of Battlefront 2's newest additions. They're around the same size, and Baby Yoda potters around in a pod with a spherical bottom, so they're already pretty close. The wee droids are a real pain in the arse to deal with, given how tiny they are, so hopefully Baby Yoda will be just as deft at surviving.
 I like to think I'm above falling for Disney's Force persuasion powers, but I love Baby Yoda and will die to protect him. Judging by my normal Battlefront 2 performance, I will be proving that a lot. The movies imply nobody in Star Wars knows how to shoot a gun, but I've sadly not found that to be the case in the game.

Here, a small increase from 1.1% to 1.2% is on the cards." "If Core CPI comes out at 1.2%, EUR/USD has room to edge lower, as it would still leave the common currency exposed to a correction." "A disappointing level of 1.1% or lower could serve as the spark a more significant correction as it would allow the ECB to add more stimulus." "If underlying inflation rises to 1.3% it could keep the bank on the sidelines as economic data would not warrant action. EUR/USD could extend its gains within overbought conditions."

The Hillcats still presented much greater resistance than in the first meeting of the two teams, which saw ESU carry away a 62-point margin of victory.
 “It’s always hard, you always try to prepare, you try to tell your team you can’t ever underestimate anybody, you always have got to be ready because you don’t know what’s going to happen,” ESU Head Coach Toby Wynn said. “As much as you try to say it, sometimes it’s hard for them to really do it. Especially if you get off to a quick start and get some separation, score some points, then things get rolling. You see how that happened in the second half. We got some separation, then ... we subbed and we just didn’t maintain the same intensity and they kind of came back on us a little bit. (In) college basketball, teams have a lot of pride. For Rogers, it’s the last game of their season, for some of these seniors, it might be the last game that they ever play in college basketball. You have to expect them to come out and play hard, lay it all on the line. I thought Rogers did a great job of that today. They competed all the way to the end.”
 Emporia State had reached a double-digit lead before the end of the first quarter, but Rogers State countered with a run to close the deficit back to four, at 22-18.
 The Lady Hornets returned the favor, getting as far ahead as 16, but the Hillcats again answered with a push to rally within nine just before halftime.
 “(Senior Day can provide) hard games to play in because they’re really emotional and obviously, it’s the last time they’re going to be playing here at White,” Wynn said. “You put a lot into those. You want it to be the best game you possibly can play, sometimes you press a little bit and try (too) hard. I thought our seniors handled it very well.”
 The third quarter, which has provided Emporia State any number of problems throughout the season, gave the Lady Hornets a boost on Saturday as they opened the second half with a 16-0 run to seemingly blow the game open.
 Rogers State made one last push, trimming a 28-point deficit back to 17 before ESU was able to finish things off.
 Though the Hillcats shot nearly 45 percent from the floor, 20 turnovers proved most costly as the Lady Hornets shot 51 percent, including 35 points from the extra possessions they received.
 Freshman Tre’Zure Jobe scored a team-high 20 points for Emporia State, but Morgan Laudan, Mollie Mounsey and Jessica Wayne each reached double-digits (13, 18 and 13 respectively) in their final game on Slaymaker Court.
 “This place is truly a special building and I couldn’t imagine playing anywhere else (for) my four years,” Laudan said. “(I’m) just thankful to have been a Lady Hornet for four years and can’t wait to keep playing.”
 The victory assured ESU of the two-seed in the MIAA Postseason Tournament. The Lady Hornets will open their turn at 2:15 p.m. Thursday against the winner between Wednesday’s meeting between seventh-seeded Central Oklahoma and 10th- seed Northwest Missouri.
 ESU enters the postseason having won seven of its final eight games.

The movies imply nobody in Star Wars knows how to shoot a gun, but I've sadly not found that to be the case in the game.                                                                                           Download the skin on Nexus Mods.                                                                                           Battlefront 2 also received a hefty update last week, returning to the original trilogy and throwing in a new ewok hero for good measure. It's been more focused on the Clone Wars and Rise of Skywalker until now, so it's nice to be back.

In his writing and speaking, Welch shared the wisdom he gained in a GE career that began right after he left grad school. He quickly climbed the ranks, and became the company's youngest chairman and CEO in 1981, at age 45. Welch quickly shook up GE, laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname "Neutron Jack," after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact. Welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. Welch also divested GE of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be No. 1 or 2 in their markets. The early moves dismantled GE's bureaucracy and eliminated many layers of reporting relationships.

REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — Police in Delaware arrested a man accused of entering a bar and pointing a BB gun made to look like a handgun at people gathered inside, authorities confirmed Sunday. Patrons and workers at a Rehoboth Beach bar reported late Saturday that an agitated man had grabbed an employee and pointed a gun at others inside the establishment, the city's police department said in a statement. An officer saw the suspect walking down the road afterward, then spotted him stashing what appeared to be a gun inside a tree, the police statement said. Officers found the weapon and determined it was a BB gun made to look like a .40-caliber handgun. Bryan P. Meck, 28, was taken into custody and charged with three counts of felony aggravated menacing, carrying a concealed dangerous instrument, offensive touching and disorderly conduct. It's unclear whether he has an attorney who can comment on his behalf.

The first is probably the name everyone thinks of when they think of organic beer in Maine – Peak Organic Brewing company. Based in Portland, Peak was an early adopter of organic brewing and has had its hand in helping several local and regional hop and grain farms get up to speed so that they could provide enough ingredients to fuel the demand for their beer. The lineup of Peak beers is entirely canned, so it can come with you on beer adventures in any season, and includes not just fresh pale ales and IPAs, but also the occasional sour (such as Sweet Tart). I particularly am a fan of Fresh Cut, which is a dry- hopped lager that is as crisp as it gets.

Trackmania, Ubisoft's hectic racing series, is coming back for another lap. The next addition to the series is a remake of 2006's Trackmania Nations, a free-to-play spin-off that was fuelled by in-game adverts. The original is still available on Steam, but the remake will apparently include new features, like the seasonal campaign and extra custom track options.                                                                                           The first Trackmania Nations boasted plenty of solo tracks, multiplayer modes and custom creations, but Nadeo found that in most games players rush through the campaign and then never pick it up again. According to managing director Florent Castelnerac, the new seasonal setup is a response to that.                                                                                           Expect a regular official campaign designed by Nadeo and a daily track selection picked from player-submitted maps, along with regular updates and new customisation options and features arriving with future seasons.                                                                                           Racers will be able to duke it out in friendly casual competitions, as well as daily and weekly races. Nadeo also plans to run a bunch of different cups, as well as an international pro-level league, an open league and seasonal campaign rankings.                                                                                          While some players might bounce off it after the campaign, Trackmania's managed to keep a lot of them around thanks to the track creator. This time around, Trackmania Nations' creator has been upgraded with new physical surfaces, as well as blocks that can modify car behaviour, including a slow motion block.                                                                                          Despite the new additions, Ubisoft Nadeo is still keeping the fundamentals simple. The four-arrow control scheme is being maintained, while Nadeo is hoping that being able to race their ghosts will help players improve their racing skills. And since Trackmania is all about high-speed, acrobatic racing, players will conveniently maintain their velocity when they respawn at checkpoints.                                                                                           There's no word on a release date yet.

The Tokyo Marathon held at the weekend had a much-reduced field and few fans showed up to watch.
 Cycling was also effected last week when the UAE Tour was cancelled with two stages remaining after two Italian team members were suspected of having tested positive for coronavirus.
 Denmark's Michael Morkov was forced to self-isolate when he arrived at the Berlin world track championships last week, having taken part in the UAE race. Morkov was eventually cleared to race, winning a gold medal in the madison.
 Park said British Cycling were well-equipped to avoid any possible coronavirus infections with the national velodrome's changing rooms in Manchester getting a deep clean last week.
 "We are preparing as if (the Olympics) are going to happen," he said. "That's all we can do. No point wasting our energy worrying about it, but equally we will take the right advice from the NHS and WHO in terms of making sure we can do everything we can to look after out athletes.
 "We are making sure that we don't let it become a distraction or overtake the preparation. As soon as you start doing that, start thinking 'it might not happen' what are you preparing for? We are full steam ahead and expecting to be there in July, in Tokyo, having fun."
 Morkov, who spent 34 hours in his hotel room before being given the all-clear, said the "whole world was waiting" to see what happens. "Big things could be cancelled, but it's out of everybody's hands," the 34-year-old said.
 Norwegian rider Anita Stenberg, winner of the bronze medal in the points race in Berlin, said, given the choice, she would go to Tokyo irrespective of the coronavirus outbreak.
 "So many riders have been fighting to qualify for years. If it would be cancelled it would be a shame. If they say it's my responsibility I would go anyway. I would take the risk."
 Malaysia's Azizulhasni Awang, who won bronze in the men's sprint and keirin, said he was concerned.
 "It's spreading into more and more countries and getting worse in Japan and Korea," he said. "I believe the government of Japan will do something and the Games will have no problem.
 "I hope there's a Plan B, but I'm not sure."

That said, if those features don't mean that much to you, $60 for the standard Kindle is not to be sneezed at, although it will mean less storage (4GB instead of 8GB) -- but then again, how many books can you really be reading at once?

At the heart of their development programme is 'Oakmanology', an award-winning learning and skills hub which was designed in-house by Oakman’s HR team, led by HR Director, Jill Scatchard. Oakmanology takes employees through both craft and leadership development, using a mix of online micro-learning opportunities including fact sheets, quizzes, eLearning, face to face training, videos and assessments.
 Oakman Inns’ CEO, Peter Borg-Neal, said: “I get very emotional when I consider just how important a recognition this is of our relatively small company.

They are the reasons that this company, which is only just over twelve years old, has grown and developed. We don’t stop trying, we don’t stop caring and we’ll never stop trying to please.”

WAVELAND, Miss. (WLOX) - The mother of a 10-year-old Biloxi girl is alive thanks to the quick actions and smart choices of her heroic daughter.A 10-year-old Biloxi girl’s quick thinking and heroic actions helped save her mother’s life last month after her mom went into shock while driving.Patricia Moseley and her daughter Jami-Anne were driving in Waveland when the mother suddenly fainted. Thinking her mom was going into diabetic shock, her daughter immediately jumped into action.“She started to drive down the road and her hands just flew off the wheel because she could barely even touch the steering wheel and the car went off into the parking lot,” said Jami-Anne, who goes to North Bay Elementary.Jami-Ann's dog Cherokee is in training right now to become her service dog.The child’s dad Roger was an EMT and taught her exactly what to do. Using the vehicle’s On Star feature, Jami- Anne called 911 then waved down a police officer for help.Typing in the password on her mom’s phone, Jami-Anne began gathering information to help first responders.“I pulled up a list of all her medications and I got out her driver’s license,” said Jami-Anne. “I was just sitting there thinking it’s a good thing that I memorized where all this stuff is in her wallet and what to do when something like this happens.”Waveland police officer Paul Taylor immediately started working to help the child and her mother.According to Jami-Ann’s dad, Patricia had a bite of some kind and had actually gone in to anaphylactic shock.Officer Taylor was honored as the city’s employee of the month for his quick actions to save Patricia and help Jami-Ann. But it’s praise he said he doesn’t deserve because Jami-Ann was the real hero of the day.Jami-Ann has a brain tumor and suffers from postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which is a condition that cause abnormally large increases in her heart rate.Along with her furry friend Cherokee, who is in training to become her service dog, Jami-Ann said her parents are her biggest support system.Jami-Anne and her sidekick Cherokee“I don’t know what I would do without them,” she said. “They’re always there for me when I’m upset and when I’m sad and so I’m always going to be there for them.”Jami-Ann’s parents have long known she was a remarkable child. Now, she can add superhero to her list of accomplishments."To me, it was really a big deal. It was for somebody I love so I was going to do it,” said Jami-Anne. “It made me feel like I really can do anything.Jami-Anne dreams of becoming both a flight nurse and a marine biologist.Copyright 2020 WLOX.

I thought Saturday he wrestled fantastic.
 “I’m super-proud of him and the future’s really, really bright for him. He’s a special kid.”
 Tungjaroenkul ended his tournament by earning a 3-0 winning decision over Kapaun-Mt. Carmel’s Joe Walter and took third after defeating Andover’s Gabe Maki by a 5-3 margin.
 “That weight at the state tournament was really, really tough,” Medrano said. “There’s a returning state finalist that didn’t even make the podium.”

 His fellow freshman Lukas Hainline got some mixed results, going 2-2 and coming up one victory shy of reaching the podium. He was leading on the scoreboard in his final match when Shawnee Heights’ Brock Ferguson came back for the pin.
 “He definitely could’ve wrestled better, but he came through the back, wrestled really hard, just ran into a tough kid from Shawnee Heights,” Medrano said. “We had the lead right at the end. We just chalk it up to experience. We’re going to use that for fuel to the fire to prepare for next year.”

 News
 The Tartu County Court has delayed making a decision in the criminal case of Martin Hallik, former director of the University of Tartu Library accused of sexual offenses.
 The court was scheduled to deliver the decision in the case on Monday, but took a time extension and has rescheduled the announcement for March 18.
 The prosecutor's office on February 7 applied for Hallik to be found guilty and sought for a real prison sentence to be meted out to him.
 Tatjana Tamm, district prosecutor at the South District Prosecutor's Office, has previously said that the accused made use of his position of power on two occasions to compel the victim to engage in sexual intercourse or other act of sexual nature.
 Hallik's attorney, Oliver Naas, has previously stressed that Hallik is not accused of rape. Hallik has denied guilt throughout the process.
 The case of Hallik is handled behind closed doors to protect the victim's privacy, and for that reason the detailed content of the charges will not be disclosed.
 Hallik has been charged with two counts under the section of the Penal Code dealing with compelling a person to engage in sexual intercourse or other act of sexual nature by taking advantage of the dependency of the victim on the offender.
 The former library director last fall submitted a complaint to the labor dispute committee regarding the decision of his dismissal. The committee declared the dismissal null and void and ordered the University of Tartu to pay a financial compensation in the amount of over €100,000 to Hallik.
 The University of Tartu appealed the committee's decision. The appeal was satisfied and the decision annulled by the Tartu Circuit Court in January.

And that’s only part of the picture. Africa has not fully capitalized on a game-changing opportunity: monetizing our oil and gas resources. This starts with using oil and gas as a feedstock to create other value-added products. Natural gas, for example, can be used to make liquid transport fuels, base oils, paraffin, and naphtha. The resulting revenues can be used to build infrastructure and diversify economies. This is not an abstract, pie in the sky idea. In Equatorial Guinea, for example, initiatives aimed at monetizing the country’s massive natural gas reserves has led to the creation of new infrastructure. It is helping the government build a natural gas mega hub that could make Equatorial Guinea a major player in the global liquified natural gas market and bring in $2 billion in revenues. There’s no reason that other African countries can’t do the same.
