SYDNEY -- World number two Novak Djokovic played tactical tennis on Saturday to pick apart the enigmatic Daniil Medvedev at the inaugural ATP Cup in Sydney and earn a place for Serbia in the tournament's final.
 The Serbian won the match 6-1 5-7 6-4 after he relentlessly pushed the 198cm (6.5 ft) tall Russian around the court, forcing Medvedev to constantly scrape shots off his shoe laces.
 Serbia now faces the winner of host nation Australia, led by Alex De Minaur, and Rafael Nadal's Spain in Sunday's final.
 Earlier, Serbia's Dusan Lajovic beat his more highly ranked opponent, Russia's Karen Khachanov, giving Serbia an unassailable 2-0 lead going into the doubles match.
 Less than two weeks out from the Australian Open, Djokovic gave the world's top players a possible blueprint on how to beat the 23-year-old Russian who has been regularly toppling the game's elite.
 While Medvedev's slapping forehand, flat backhand and big serve have proven hard to counter, Djokovic used dropshots and low slicing backhands to pull the world number five into awkward places.
 Medvedev's long reach was nullified at the net with the Serbian regularly choosing to land shots at the Russian's shoes rather than aim for a clean pass.
 The tactical play, however, is easier said than done against the powerful Russian who was undefeated at the ATP Cup going into the match.
 Djokovic said his tactics worked for a set before his opponent responded.
 "He started figuring out the strategy and I had to adjust and I had to change," Djokovic said after the match.
 After the early success, the Serbian conceded four straight games in the second set, which he went on to lose.
 Djokovic destroyed a racquet as his form drifted off and his energy stores appeared depleted even though the players were enjoying a respite from the intense heat that has been fueling bushfires across Australia.
 The introduction of the ATP Cup to the southern hemisphere calendar has created the most grueling and entertaining start to the Australian tennis season in memory, as top players chase prize money, ranking points and a team trophy rather than play in grand slam warm-up events.
 Not for the first time this tournament, a vocal pro-Serbian crowd lifted their hero in the decider.
 Djokovic secured a break of serve in the fifth game when Medvedev chose to try and wrong-foot the fatigued Serbian, rather than playing into the open court.
 The decision proved costly. Djokovic's serve held firm for the remainder, which ended when the Russian netted a groundstroke. (Reporting by Jonathan Barrett in Sydney; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)

Another reason for it is that Rockwood is so unselfish herself. She put 30 points on the board but did not do an inordinate amount of shooting to do it. She nailed six 3-pointers but her passing was every bit as impressive.
 “She would rather get the assist than score. If you are open, she will find you,” Windsor coach Bruce MacKay said.
 But star power was wearing blue in the opening quarter. The underdog Otters came out and stunned the Jackets by taking a 12-6 lead. They were still in front 14-10 when the quarter ended.
 OV’s Alice Keith cut to the hoop and rang up a layup on the game’s first possession and then Livia Bernhardt knocked down both free throws. The Otters were up 4-0, the pep band was in the building and the large crowd was bringing the energy.
 “This is a tough place to play,” MacKay said. “Otter Valley plays physical and they play hard.
 “They are a deep team and they have strength down low.”
 They got plenty out of that strength in the post with Bernhardt scoring 17 and Leah Pinkowski 16.
 “They are bigger than us,” MacKay said.
 That is why he had the Jacks pressing after that opening quarter, attempting to disrupt the entry passes.
 The victory pushes the Yellow Jackets’ record to 7-1.
 They were coming off a convincing 61-36 win over Division I Brattleboro but this one would come a lot harder.
 The Otters fell to 2-4.
 Otter Valley coach Kelly Trayah felt it was the second quarter that did in the Otters. They got outscored 19-8 during the stanza.
 “I thought that was the turning point,” he said.
 Rockwood put Windsor into a 16-14 lead with one of her 3-point field goals during that quarter. Bernhardt then drew the Otters even by scoring down low.
 Evelyn Page put the Jacks in front with a free throw and then Page scored off a gorgeous dish from Rockwood. The Jacks pulled away from there to a 29-22 halftime lead.
 The Otters did their best to hang around. Bernhardt muscled inside for a three-point lead that cut the lead to 37-33.
 But after Prior scored five quick points to bump the lead to 44-31, the Otters did not seriously threaten. Windsor was able to take a 49-33 lead into the final quarter.
 Alia Edmunds had eight points to follow Bernhardt and Pinkowski in scoring for the Otters.
 Prior and Ashley Grela added nine points apiece for the Jacks.
 Windsor’s only loss was to Thetford. The Jacks split their two games with the Panthers, Thetford winning the most recent one in Thetford.

Houseplants can have us gardening year-round. They add a decorative touch to a home, and they emit oxygen and help remove toxins to purify the air.
 Shopping for your first houseplant or adding more to your collection can be an exciting experience. How does one choose a houseplant? I look for ones with interesting texture, foliage and form. More importantly does it appear healthy. Here are some tips when shopping for a houseplant and for maintaining it.
 • CHOOSING A PLANT - Look for plants with healthy green foliage and dense, bushy growth. One with an abundance of closed buds is a better choice than one in full bloom. Always check for insects at the tips of new branches, at the places where the leaves join the stems and on the underside of the leaves.
 • LIGHT - Plants grown only for attractive foliage require less light. Succulents or cacti and flowering plants require direct sunlight. Succulents and cacti do make ideal houseplants since indoors the humidity is dry, and they prefer that kind of environment.
 • SPACE - Plants grow at different rates. For immediate gratification in a small area, Norfolk Pine, Dracena Marginata, Fiddle Leaf Fig tree, Schefflera and Rubber Tree are some serious contenders for making a statement in a small space.
 • INDOOR TEMPERATURE - Many houseplants are tropical in origin, so they prefer high humidity. If you are in a climate where humidity is low indoors, you can raise the humidity several ways. Misting plants, keeping pots on water-filled trays or grouping plants near one another to trap existing moisture can help raise the humidity for houseplants.
 • WATERING - The biggest problem is overwatering houseplants. Choose a container with good drainage. Add water to the top of the soil surface until water comes out the drainage holes. Or watering can be done by placing the pot into a container filled with water and leave it remain in the container for fifteen minutes. Tepid water is best for watering to avoid shocking plants and causing them to wilt.
 • FEEDING - Read the care tag on the plant for fertilizing and keeping your plant healthy. If you are unsure about the feeding of a particular houseplant, experts at your local garden center or floral shop should be able to provide answers to your questions.
 • MAINTENANCE - Plant foliage should be rinsed under a gentle stream of tepid water about every two weeks to remove dust or dirt. Larger plants may be harder to rinse, so with a soft, clean cloth, gently wipe the foliage. As you wipe the leaves, use your other hand to support the undersides of the leaves.
 Keeping me company in my home are a variety of houseplants. They all have interesting foliage, texture and some even flower. A mini cactus, a dracaena, an English ivy, a bromeliad, an orchid, a kalanchoe and a bird's nest fern comprise my indoor garden.
 Maybe you too will find a spot on your kitchen windowsill for a small succulent or an empty space for a beautiful orchid beside your bedside. Houseplants will reward you daily.

Knox County Sheriff’s deputies arrested a Gray woman early Thursday morning on charges of assaulting a police officer and endangering her minor children.
 Lori Havelka, 39, allegedly kicked and grabbed Deputy Mikey Ashurst at a residence on Arkle Road, off of south Ky. 233.
 Ashurst along with Knox EMS initially responded to the scene in response to a report of a female who overdosed.
 “Deputy has responded to (Arkle Road) three times within the last mon over the female being high and out of control,” Ashurst wrote in the arrest citation.
 Deputy William Stewart, the department’s public affairs officer, that when Ashurst initially found Havelka, she was in a loft with two of her children and refused to come down.
 Ashurst stated that after he got the kids out of the loft, Havelka attempted to walk away from him, at which time he grabbed her arm.
 “When Deputy Ashurst got her out of the loft she became belligerent and violent grabbing Deputy Ashurst by his clothing,” Stewart stated. “When Deputy Ashurst advised her she was under arrest, she started striking him and when Deputy Ashurst attempted to hand cuff her, she grabbed the hand cuffs and again Assault Deputy Ashurst.
 Ashurst stated, that he deployed his pepper spray in order to bring Havelka under control
 Stewart stated that the struggle continued during which Havelka reportedly kicked Ashurst, before she was secured in the hand cuffs.
 “During the arrest Deputy Ashurst determined she was under the influence of methamphetamine,” Stewart stated.
 Ashurst stated that Havelka continued to resist, refusing to walk to the cruiser or get inside.
 “Female urinated in the back of the patrol car while screaming and cussing,” Ashurst stated.
 Havelka was charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor, third-degree assault on a police officer, public intoxication – controlled substance, resisting arrest, menacing, and second-degree disorderly conduct.
 She was lodged in the Knox County Detention Center where she is being held on a $10,000 cash bond.

Dubai to the banks of Savick Brook in the space of a few days!
 For Neil, Sinclair’s arrival marked the conclusion of a search for Callum Robinson’s replacement.
 That search had started in July when £8m took Robbo across the Pennines to Sheffield United.
 North End asked about Sinclair’s availability then and didn’t get too far due to the price tag.
 Six months on and with the player’s Celtic contract running down, they were able to do business.
 It was a deal which suited Sinclair, PNE and Celtic.
 The move presents the winger with the chance to get regular first-team action, something he didn’t get in the first-half of this season.
 Celtic offloaded a player who was out of the picture, freeing up space if they want to do some January business of their own.
 North End get the quality Sinclair clearly possesses and hopefully he can produce that in abundance over the coming seasons.
 His strongest position where in the main he produced the goods for Celtic was down the left side of the attack, cutting inside on to his right foot.
 That is the position which Sean Maguire has in the main filled this season and of late taken stick from some quarters for how he has performed there.
 Goals and assists might have been in short supply of late but the effort was there, Neil explaining Maguire’s absence for the FA Cup last week was due to him getting a breather having returned the highest intensity statistics in the squad.
 Neil bristled somewhat at a question during Thursday’s press conference about where the arrival of Sinclair would leave Maguire.
 His reply was along the lines that places were up for grabs right across the front line after the shortage of goals over the last 10 league games – just five in that time.
 That left hand role still looks the favourite for Sinclair to fill though, but he can play through the middle.
 His arrival certainly makes the departure of Andre Green last week far more logical now.
 There was something of an outcry when Green headed back to Aston Villa and then straight out on loan to Charlton.
 But he hadn’t been used regularly since August and at all since October, the cutting short of his loan creating room in the squad and on the wage bill.
 Along the front, Neil now has Sinclair, Maguire, Nugent, Tom Barkhuizen, Jayden Stockley, Billy Bodin and Josh Harrop to call on.
 We can probably discount Josh Ginnelly, with the plan being to send him out on loan to get games.
 What comes next after Sinclair in terms of new blood, we’ll have to see.
 A decent amount of budget has been used getting Sinclair here, not in terms of a fee but wages.
 Hopefully there is some left to allow another tweak or two as North End seek to recover from the recent dip in form and mount a strong push over the second-half of the season.
 The play-off places are wide open, this is a campaign where a whole of host of clubs will fancy their chances of claiming a slot in the top six.
 Sinclair has the pedigree to make a difference and provide that know-how. An extra body this month might help even more.
 Best of luck to Sinclair, a signing both exciting and logical.

 We can debate the strength of the Scottish Premiership until the cows come home but the fact is Sinclair scored 62 goals for Celtic north of the border, playing Champions League and Europa League football.
 He won their player of the year award and the Celtic fans had a chant in his honour to the tune of Supertramp’s Logical Song.
 For those not familiar with early 1970s prog rock music, that is where the ‘beautiful and magical’ line comes from.

Since President Trump ordered the killing of Iran's General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, politicians and citizens alike have questioned the operation's legitimacy. In the absence of a declaration of war, was the targeted killing of an enemy on foreign soil justified? Further, was it effective?
 The first question, was Soleimani's killing justified, does not allow for a short answer. Justified by what measure? Expediency? Safety? Morality? Ethicists have wrestled with such questions for centuries and have provided guidelines for what is just.
 The idea that war may sometimes be justified is thousands of years old. Aristotle introduced the concept into the West, and St. Augustine revisited the idea from a biblically informed and classically trained mindset. In just war theory, certain thresholds must be met before an act of violence can be considered just. Does the killing of Soleimani meet those thresholds?
 The first threshold is that the act of violence must be ordered by a legitimate authority. Since President Trump ordered the military action, and he is the U.S. commander in chief, this qualification seems to be met. One might object, however, that without the Iraqi government's consent - Soleimani was in Iraq at the time - the U.S. president's authority was not legitimate.
 The second threshold requires there to be sufficient cause to take the violent action. It could be (and has been) argued that, since General Soleimani had been responsible for a campaign of terror and death, the second threshold had already been met.
 Another requirement is that the act of violence was righteously motivated. Motivation is difficult to determine and President Trump's changing explanations - sometimes claiming he was "preventing imminent and sinister attacks" and at other times sounding like he was enacting vengeance - do not help. But since motive is so hard to determine, it might be best to leave this one alone.
 Just war theory also requires that the act of violence be a last resort. Since other actions, notably economic sanctions, were previously taken, one could argue this threshold has been met. A further requirement is that the action be proportionate to the desired intent. This is hard to discern, given the administration's equivocal explanations.
 Perhaps the most challenging threshold to be met is that the action can be reasonably expected to improve the situation - that it is likely to right wrongs and increase the probability of lasting peace. With this, we move from the question of the action's justification to that of its effectiveness.
 Commentators who applaud Mr. Trump's decision are quick to make the case that the killing of the general has made the world a safer place. Soleimani, they say, was the hinge on which the Iranian campaign of destabilization turned. They regard him as a unique and irreplaceable evil genius whose death will impede Iran's campaign of regional violence for the foreseeable future.
 Maybe. But predicting the future is not in my skill set and I've never known anyone, political commentators included, who have mastered it. What I do know is that evil will not be overcome by evil. It will only be overcome by good.
 Was the killing of Soleimani justified? Who knows? Will it be effective? It is doubtful. In the short term, his death may hinder Iran's efforts to destabilize regional governments and drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East. In the long term, his death may elevate equally capable military officers and inspire an enduring hatred of the U.S. among a younger generation. The killing of one terrorist may inspire a thousand to take his place.
 The only way to overcome evil, as St. Paul made clear, is with good. This may seem naive but it is actually efficient. Truth is one example of an overcoming good. Rather than rely on military might alone, our leaders should make known to the people of Iran the truth about General Soleimani and the regime he served. Their ongoing campaign of violence and hatred should be exposed.
 If it is argued that such an approach underestimates the evil that Iran represents, one might counter that it correctly estimates the good that truth accomplishes. If our goal is lasting peace, it is the epitome of naivete to believe that military action alone can accomplish it.

Tranquil Dawn is Dulux’s colour of the year and it’s a very doable pale green, the kind you will soon see in early spring shoots. It’s great for rooms that get a lot of direct sunlight, especially when teamed with soft warm whites but will feel cold in north-facing spaces. It’s easy to work into existing colour schemes too and will work with existing pale greys to help freshen them up. You could try it on architraving and woodwork to pick out the detailing as a way of refreshing a room. Behind the scenes Dulux’s team of creatives put a lot of energy and time into creating other less easy-to-sell colour combinations that are also worth a look – for those that would like a home that feels less on trend but very polished. These include this offbeat pink and green combination that fuses Dulux Burnished Brass, a ripe green with a lot of yellow, and Heartwood, a dull mid-century pink and really helps to pick out wall detailing such as the panelling pictured. These cost €46.95 for 2.5 litres of the paint company’s diamond matt, the hardest-wearing formula.dulux.ie

Jack Shelton died the other day.      I will pause while you Google who he was.      The singer-trumpeter-actor-comedian was probably best known for his work with Merv Griffin and that ABC Saturday morning staple, "Schoolhouse Rock." Raise your hand if you remember Conjunction Junction and those other ditties that educated and entertained you as a child, and now songlock-torture you for hours whenever you read or hear a word or two featured in those little annoying nuggets.      One of the most famous of those skits was "I'm Just a Bill" that was designed to teach kids how government works. Jack Shelton sang in that and played the voice of the bill.      "I'm just a bill, oh yeah, I'm only a bill, and if they vote for me on Capitol Hill …"      In a nutshell, the segment explained how legislation becomes law in Washington and it focused on something as simple as making school buses stop at railroad crossings. Ol' Bill was presented to both the House and Senate, which passed him unanimously and then went to the White House where the president signed him without hesitation.      Yeah, right.      Perhaps in the mind of a 1970s, 8-year-old sugared up from all that frosted cereal he had just downed before loudly singing and slam-dancing to the little ditty, that is how government is supposed to work. But fast-forward to today's times and try to get something like that on TV now. The process is not that simple anymore.      First of all, "Schoolhouse Rock" would have to be expanded from a little 5-minute segment to upwards of 30 minutes or longer in order to cover how legislation really gets through. And it is far more than just idea-draft-vote- approve-sign-law procedure, now.      If "I'm Just a Bill" were to be produced in today's turbulent political climate, it might look something like this:      First, the concept would have to run through social media to determine if it is actually worth pursuing. After that, a robocall blast would go out to a cross-section of the representative's constituency to take their temperature on it.      Colleagues opine about its strengths and weakness on the morning talk-shows and party leadership takes part in a "CNN Town Hall" to gauge how it will affect the party's standing in terms of strengthening their stronghold. Included in that process are all the robocalls and TV ads screaming at key constituencies to "let Senator Smith know where you stand on this."      If you're lucky, someone like the president of the United States will tweet about it, sending even more voters into their respective political corners.      And that is all before the bill is even introduced. Once it is drafted, a whole new process kicks in.      The representatives do a little horse-trading and back-scratching to make sure the bill gets before the "right" committee, all the time praying for a preferred placement on the agenda. More robocalls, Facebook posts, tweets and sound-bites follow.      Three months later, the committee takes up the bill, already knowing its fate. That sucker is either dying here or it will be sent to the full chamber for an even more public fate. C-SPAN televises live floor debates and counts down on- screen how long it takes for Democrats and Republicans to vote on it.      Are you still with us, kids?      If the bill makes it through, the entire process is repeated on the other side of Capitol Hill. In the meantime, the president continues to tweet about it, and spin doctors/talking heads continue to appear on the talk shows blessing it or blasting it.      If the bill survives Capitol Hill, it's then off to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. for even more politicking. If the president likes it, the president signs it and all is well. If the president doesn't like it, the president will either veto it and tweet-dare Congress to override it, or try to incorporate it into some other legislative package.      In the meantime, the robocalls and social-media blasts continue.      Get the picture now, kids?      Perhaps Mr. Shelton, God rest his soul, could have updated the 1970s "Schoolhouse Rock" song to go something like, "I'm just a bill, yeah, I'm only a bill. But I'm raising cain from Capitol Hill."      Run that over and over through your mind as you try to sleep tonight.   Bill Atkinson is interim editor of The Progress-Index in Petersburg, Virginia.

That doesn’t mean we can’t change what news we consume, though. It is clear we are starved of good news and lap it up when it is served to us. I am not proposing that we ignore bad news in favour of only reading heartwarming stories about puppies being fitted with hearing aids. After all, it is vital that we stay informed and don’t turn a blind eye to all the injustices taking place in the world. But it is clear that we, as human beings, can only handle so much negativity before our brains get frazzled. We need a little optimism to get by.

Un po’ per l’orgoglio e un po’ per la cabala, anche se sull’argomento Sarri puo obiettare con solidi argomenti, ma soprattutto per dare il segnale di forza piu atteso in questo eterno e bellissimo duello. Juventus e Inter, dopo aver disputato un’intensa mezza maratona a braccetto, si trovano a dover fare la volata per il titolo di campione d’inverno: non era mai successo nella Serie A con 20 squadre e i tre punti a vittoria, ma avere due squadre a pari punti nell’ultima tappa del girone d’andata conferma quanto sia imprevedibile e spettacolare questo campionato senza padroni. Tra San Siro e l’Olimpico andra in scena uno show nello show, visto che i nerazzurri ospitano l’Atalanta dei miracoli nell’anticipo di stasera e i bianconeri affrontano la Roma domani sera. Chi esce indenne dalla doppia trappola si prende mezzo scudetto, quasi un’ipoteca per quello di maggio come certifica il 76% dei casi. Conte lo sa benissimo, dato che ha fatto il percorso netto nella Juve dal 2011 al 2014, mentre Sarri vuole farsi uno speciale regalo di compleanno per i suoi 61 anni. Anche per dimenticare quelle due volte che con il Napoli ha girato la boa in testa (2015/16 e 2017/18), salvo poi vedere laurearsi campioni d’Italia quei bianconeri che ora allena. Nella girandola di corsi e ricorsi storici il titolo d’inverno accende fantasie, ricordi e rivalita, senza dimenticare che puo essere anche assegnato a due squadre come e successo solo nel 2003/04 con Milan e Roma a quota 42 punti. Esiste anche l’ipotesi di un podio allargato a tre formazioni se Juve e Inter dovessero perdere entrambe, con la Lazio vittoriosa oggi contro il Napoli e poi nel recupero del 5 febbraio contro il Verona. La partita e tutta da giocare, difficile annoiarsi.

“We didn’t come out and do what we needed to do,” Prior said of the narrow loss in Thetford.
 On this night, the Jacks did what they needed to and the Otters served notice that it would take some effort to beat them.
 “We knew we had to pick up our game,” Prior said of the first-quarter deficit.
 After that, it was simply too much Rockwood.
 “Olivia shot the lights out,” Trayah said.
 She also did a superb job of setting up teammates.
 The Yellow Jackets are back in Rutland County on Tuesday. They will bring their act to Fair Haven.
 The Otters are at Mill River on Monday.
 It is a healthy consensus that the Big Three in Division III is comprised of unbeaten Lake Region, Windsor and Thetford.
 After Friday night, MacKay thought that the Otters might well be viable contender to be No. 4 in the pecking order.

Arctic Bay is one of the new smooth impasto colours at Porter’s Paint, an Australian brand set up by Sydney house painter Peter Lewis who started mixing lime washes in accordance with the notes left in diaries belonging to his grandfather, an Irishman named Fred Porter who built some of Sydney’s landmark buildings. This range is characterised by its lack of uniformity. There’s a distinct layering of pigment and subtle but visible brush marks that gives a very matt, non-reflective sheen that has a velvet opaque finish that is easy on the eye. The super smooth texture works well with suede furnishings and rugs underfoot. The finish also detracts from imperfectly plastered walls. Pictured is Arctic Bay, a deeply restful glacial green that has a lot of grey in it that will work well in dark rooms. Crossmaglen-based McAllister Interiors is the distributor in Ireland where four litres of impasto costs about €234.mcallisterinteriors.com; porterspaints.com.

WELLINGTON -- Serena Williams showed no signs of sentiment as she clinically dispatched teenager Amanda Anismiova 6-1 6-1 in just 45 minutes on Saturday to advance to the Auckland Classic final against Jessica Pegula.
 Williams, who won the first of her 23 Grand Slam titles before Anisimova was born, gave the 18-year-old a harsh lesson in tennis reality and showed again that she was not prepared to let the next generation take over just yet.
 Anisimova said on Friday it had been a life-long dream to play Williams but she must have felt she was living a nightmare on the main court at Auckland Tennis Centre on Saturday.
 The 38-year-old gave the third-seed little opportunity to get into the match and was just too powerful for Anisimova, who had no answer to the pace, depth and angles of her returns and service game.
 "I was definitely in the zone today and it was one of those days," said Williams. "I knew I was playing a really great player so I knew that I had to come out serious."
 The American is also in the doubles final on Sunday with good friend Caroline Wozniacki, who had her own hopes of a first Auckland title ended by Pegula 3-6 6-4 6-0 in the earlier semi-final.
 Wozniacki has been ever present at the tournament since 2015 but is retiring after the Australian Open later this month.
 She had lost her two previous finals in Auckland, to Venus Williams in 2015, and Julia Goerges in 2018.
 "Caroline has had an amazing career … and I'm glad that I got to play her before she retired, but I am just happy to get the win and am excited to be in the final," Pegula said.
 "I definitely knew that if I played defensively, I wasn't going to win that battle, because she is the best in the world at that, so I knew I had to step in, take my chances and trust my game."
 Wozniacki, who gained a measure of revenge on Goerges in the quarter-finals on Friday, raced through the first set, but found herself 3-0 down in the second.
 Pegula's lead, however, disappeared just as quickly as she had built it and Wozniacki battled back to 3-3, but the American managed to break the former world number one in the final game of the set to send it to a decider.
 It was then virtually one-way traffic in the third set as the American opened up the court and moved the Dane around and raced away with the encounter, which she sealed on her second match point opportunity with a forehand winner. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)

Ms Coppin said it was heartening to see the De Grey River flowing again, with flood plains up around the station.
 "It's bringing the country alive, a relief to people and fresh grass for our cattle, meaning more good beef coming your way."
 The De Grey River is currently flowing at a rate of 45,000 tonnes or 80 fuel tankers of water under the bridge over the Great Northern Highway, according to BOM.
 The Fortescue river is also flowing for the first time in years, as well as the Nullagine, Coongan and Shaw rivers receiving a top up.
 Ex-Tropical Cyclone Blake was the gift that kept on giving as it tracked further inland to the parched WA outback, bringing record rainfall to parts of the Goldfields-Esperance region yesterday.

 Although the system has now weakened in the Western Interior and not offered much relief to those battling bushfires in the Eucla, moderate rainfall may still occur over areas of the northern Goldfields and southwest Interior today.
 ## Lake Argyle level on the rise
 All the extra rainfall this week has also been welcomed by Ord farmers and tourism operators at Lake Argyle, which is currently sitting at its lowest point in more than 20 years.

 And now after some much-needed rain in the East Kimberley, the lake is finally creeping up, increasing almost 30cm in the last week.
 Lake Argyle Cruises owner Greg Smith said with more rain expected across the weekend from the tropical low, he was feeling optimistic the lake would continue to rise.

Since President Trump ordered the killing of Iran's General Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3, politicians and citizens alike have questioned the operation's legitimacy. In the absence of a declaration of war, was the targeted killing of an enemy on foreign soil justified? Further, was it effective?      The first question, was Soleimani's killing justified, does not allow for a short answer. Justified by what measure? Expediency? Safety? Morality? Ethicists have wrestled with such questions for centuries and have provided guidelines for what is just.      The idea that war may sometimes be justified is thousands of years old. Aristotle introduced the concept into the West, and St. Augustine revisited the idea from a biblically informed and classically trained mindset. In just war theory, certain thresholds must be met before an act of violence can be considered just. Does the killing of Soleimani meet those thresholds?      The first threshold is that the act of violence must be ordered by a legitimate authority. Since President Trump ordered the military action, and he is the U.S. commander in chief, this qualification seems to be met. One might object, however, that without the Iraqi government's consent - Soleimani was in Iraq at the time - the U.S. president's authority was not legitimate.      The second threshold requires there to be sufficient cause to take the violent action. It could be (and has been) argued that, since General Soleimani had been responsible for a campaign of terror and death, the second threshold had already been met.      Another requirement is that the act of violence was righteously motivated. Motivation is difficult to determine and President Trump's changing explanations - sometimes claiming he was "preventing imminent and sinister attacks" and at other times sounding like he was enacting vengeance - do not help. But since motive is so hard to determine, it might be best to leave this one alone.      Just war theory also requires that the act of violence be a last resort. Since other actions, notably economic sanctions, were previously taken, one could argue this threshold has been met. A further requirement is that the action be proportionate to the desired intent. This is hard to discern, given the administration's equivocal explanations.      Perhaps the most challenging threshold to be met is that the action can be reasonably expected to improve the situation - that it is likely to right wrongs and increase the probability of lasting peace. With this, we move from the question of the action's justification to that of its effectiveness.      Commentators who applaud Mr. Trump's decision are quick to make the case that the killing of the general has made the world a safer place. Soleimani, they say, was the hinge on which the Iranian campaign of destabilization turned. They regard him as a unique and irreplaceable evil genius whose death will impede Iran's campaign of regional violence for the foreseeable future.      Maybe. But predicting the future is not in my skill set and I've never known anyone, political commentators included, who have mastered it. What I do know is that evil will not be overcome by evil. It will only be overcome by good.      Was the killing of Soleimani justified? Who knows? Will it be effective? It is doubtful. In the short term, his death may hinder Iran's efforts to destabilize regional governments and drive the U.S. military out of the Middle East. In the long term, his death may elevate equally capable military officers and inspire an enduring hatred of the U.S. among a younger generation. The killing of one terrorist may inspire a thousand to take his place.      The only way to overcome evil, as St. Paul made clear, is with good. This may seem naive but it is actually efficient. Truth is one example of an overcoming good. Rather than rely on military might alone, our leaders should make known to the people of Iran the truth about General Soleimani and the regime he served. Their ongoing campaign of violence and hatred should be exposed.      If it is argued that such an approach underestimates the evil that Iran represents, one might counter that it correctly estimates the good that truth accomplishes. If our goal is lasting peace, it is the epitome of naivete to believe that military action alone can accomplish it.

“The fight that these brave clients of mine, who are standing alone against the largest medical monopoly in the United States, an octopus that has shut down hospitals and clinics, raised prices for necessary medical services, sued poor people for money when they have naught but a spoonful of gruel in their bowl, and, most shockingly, paid off local and state leaders — some of whom now seek to run for Congress — to do its bidding, is not over … by a long shot,” Santore wrote in an email.
 Ballad Health officials on Friday declined comment on the appeal and Santore’s comments.
 Ballad has not closed any hospitals since the 2018 merger of former competitors Mountain States Health Alliance and Wellmont Health System, but it has stopped offering some services or relocated services at some facilities in markets where it has multiple hospitals, including Kingsport and Greene County in Tennessee and Wise County, Virginia.
 The original complaint maintains that David Golden and Scott Niswonger should not be allowed to serve on the boards of both Ballad Health and East Tennessee State University. It challenges the role of ETSU President Brian Noland, who also serves on the Ballad board, asserting that Ballad and ETSU’s heath care providers are competitors in the marketplace.

“And there are differences between them that are irreconcilable, in terms of one note here, another note there; two of them will agree and the other three will say it’s a different way,” Chappell said. “So that is a problem for an interpreter to find a text.”
 Chappell has even looked to the famous 1922 orchestration by Ravel for answers. Looking to recordings by other pianists didn’t help much either, as there wasn’t real consistency.
 “My claim to fame here is I’m going to play it as closely as I can to the original piano piece, and not try to add things to it,” Chappell said. “There’s this new trend of ‘how to make it a better piano piece.’”
 Most people know “Pictures at an Exhibition” as a spectacular work for symphony orchestra.
 “It’s a surprise that there’s a solo piano version,” Chappell said. “‘Oh, who did that?’ Mussorgsky wrote it that way to begin with.”
