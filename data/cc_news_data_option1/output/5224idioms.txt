First off, there's support for a new wireless protocol called 'Thread.' This is kind of like Zigbee, but uses a different wireless band and offers lightning-fast light controls and better reliability. The only issue is that most people who get these lights won't have other Thread compatible gear like the HomePod mini or the Nest Wifi. That said, it's nice to have support for this tech in your lights in case you eventually buy a better router.

The response to leaders’ hypocritical behavior is highly dependent on political affiliation, experts say. People tend to rationalize a transgression from someone they agree with or respect but pounce on political opponents for the same actions.


  There’s a wider effect, too. Politicians undermining official virus messaging could make it harder to get Americans to follow precautions, especially those who may believe COVID-19 isn’t that dangerous in a country whose president has been accused of downplaying the virus that’s killed over 300,000 people.


  “They’re probably less likely to follow COVID safety guidelines,” says Jeff Stone, a psychology professor at Arizona State University.


  Some of those with the strongest virus messaging are among the “do as I say, not as I do” crowd. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo planned to host an extended family Thanksgiving until public backlash made him think twice. The California Assembly moved its legislative work to an NBA arena to ensure social distancing, but then a group of lawmakers headed to a restaurant together.

Here are some examples of easier fund flows. Unemployment benefits for those who have lost their jobs - and they are many - is 70% of previous pay. If this benefit is say $500 per person per week then a household of two working people will be eligible for $4000 per month and this has been going on for months.

An arcane battle over emergency Federal Reserve powers is frustrating efforts to lock down an agreement on an almost $1 trillion COVID-19 economic relief package, the AP reports. Saturday's impasse is just the latest stumble in a partisan, monthslong fight, and feelings hardened as the Senate congregated for a weekend session. Lawmakers on both sides said a provision by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would curb emergency Federal Reserve powers was the sticking point. Republicans are insisting on the Toomey plan, while Democrats are adamantly against it. A compromise was proving elusive, and the two sides seem stuck for the time being. "That has to be resolved. And then everything will fall into place," said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. "It's a very significant difference."

 WhatsApp is one of the most popular messaging clients in the world. Still, its desktop and web clients haven't reached full parity with the mobile version, though that's been changing over the last few months.
 The latest upgrade is audio and video calls for desktop and web users. As iMore reports, citing WABetaInfo, WhatsApp Calls allows users to make and answer voice and video calls via the PC and Mac.
 As with all desktop functionality, users will still need to maintain a connection to their phone. But being able to chat at a computer makes keeping in touch with friends and family via WhatsApp easier. Like some chatters prefer a physical keyboard to send texts, others like sitting at a computer for voice and video calls. No holding up a phone or propping up a tablet for hours.
 Reportedly in the works for two years, WhatsApp Calls are only available to a small sample of WhatsApp users right now, though WABetaInfo indicates it's slowly rolling out to others. There isn't an estimated timeline for when everyone can access WhatsApp Calls, but if other feature debuts are any indication, it won't be very long until they're available for all.
 Previously, the desktop app received sticker support, allowing users to send and receive stickers that mirrored those purchased on their phones. Before that, the app introduced a shopping cart for business-oriented users as well as a "disappearing message" functionality meant to make private conversations even more so.

State Rep. Tom Demmer, of Dixon, is considering a run for statewide office in 2022. Whether for governor, U.S. Senate or another position, he has not decided.


  The 34-year-old Illinois House Deputy Minority Leader has most recently been in the news as the leading Republican on the House Special Investigating Committee of Democratic Speaker Michael Madigan. He’s also one of the House Republicans’ lead negotiators on the state budget and Medicaid legislation.


  Demmer said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois this week that he began contemplating a statewide run after discussions with colleagues on some of the “longer running issues” facing Illinois, including public corruption and seemingly never-ending budget pressures. Those issues, he said, have sewn distrust in government that he believes can be remedied through bipartisan problem solving and coalition building.

Corona Regional Medical Center southeast of Los Angeles has converted an old emergency room to help handle nearly double the usual number of ICU patients. It’s using space in two disaster tents to triage ER patients because the emergency room is filled with patients who need to be hospitalized.


  Ambulances can sit for two hours unless they are bringing in patients with critical, life-or-death emergencies.


  “There’s no room at the inn, so to speak,” hospital chief executive Mark Uffer said. “Literally every nook and cranny of the hospital is being used.”


  It’s a scene playing out across California. According to state data Friday, all of Southern California and the 12-county San Joaquin Valley to the north had exhausted their regular intensive care unit capacity and some hospitals have begun using “surge” space.


  In hard-hit Fresno County in central California, a new 50-bed alternate care site opened Friday near the community Regional Medical Center. The beds for COVID-19-negative patients will free up space in area hospitals, where just 13 of some 150 ICU beds were available Friday, said Dan Lynch, the county’s emergency medical services director.


  Lynch said he expects they will have to use the Fresno Convention Center, which can accommodate up to 250 patients, given current demand.


  Fresno and three neighboring counties also have taken the unprecedented step of sending paramedics on emergency calls to evaluate people. They won’t be taken to the emergency room if they could go to an urgent care facility or wait a few days to talk to their doctors, Lynch said.


  Some hospitals have canceled non-essential elective surgeries, such as hip replacements, that might require beds which may soon be needed for COVID-19 patients. Others are increasing staff hours or moving patients to free up space.

“After reviewing the guidance shared with superintendents from the Kentucky Department of Health and Kentucky Department of Education, we are confident that WCPS has been meeting the ‘Healthy at School’ guidance since our return to in-person classes in August, and we look forward to continuing the implementation of these protocols when students return,” WCPS Superintendent Rob Clayton wrote in a memo published on the district’s website Thursday.


  In an interview, BGISD Superintendent Gary Fields said his district is also ahead of the curve when it comes to changes to state guidelines, which Beshear formalized in an executive order issued Friday.


  “It fits into what we were doing the entire fall semester,” Fields told the Daily News last week. “I think we’re well prepared to meet all the requirements.”


  Proposed changes include making the state’s “Healthy At School” guidance mandatory. The guidelines have been framed as “safety expectations” and best practices, and they cover basic strategies for slowing the spread of COVID-19, like widespread mask use, social distancing and contact tracing in schools.


  There are also changes in the works to a color-coded matrix that schools are recommended to use to decide whether they should have in-person classes. Holding those classes while a local county is in the red with COVID-19 cases indicates schools should be “more aggressive” in moving to hybrid instruction, which the state has said means finding ways to have fewer students in a classroom at any given time.


  Beshear has also raised employee protections and course offerings for online students as sticking points to reopening schools for in-person classes.


  Beshear said he has heard from older school employees and those with serious health conditions who feel “economically coerced” into working in-person, Education Commissioner Jason Glass told superintendents in a video conference last week. Beshear has also said advanced placement courses need to be made available to students who study purely online from home.

While filming “On Pointe,” she oversaw a five-camera shoot of the ballet, which is being shown on Marquee TV. Once you’ve seen how the steps have been taught and how roles have been won, the production — even though it isn’t live — somehow makes the story of their lives complete. This is what all the hours in the studio are for: the stage. And you grasp the enormity of getting “The Nutcracker” onstage and the responsibility the children have.


  Dena Abergel, City Ballet’s children’s repertory director and a former company member who works most closely with the young cast, was relieved to see how one of her most difficult days — casting — was captured.


  “I think that most often people from the outside assume that it’s a very cutthroat kind of rejection or excitement in getting a role,” Abergel said. But she always tells the children that being in “The Nutcracker” isn’t going to make or break their lives.


  “So many people, including myself, who were _not_ cast in ‘The Nutcracker’ do go on to have professional careers,” she said. “I tell them whether you get a part today or you don’t get a part today doesn’t mean you’re not going to be a great dancer or you will be a great dancer. Because that is the truth.”


  And just as integral are details — short and sweet — that reveal much about the connection between the school and City Ballet. During an onstage dress rehearsal, Georgina Pazcoguin, a City Ballet soloist, sews her pointe shoes while chatting with a group of young Angels. “Are you guys excited?” she says. “This is a superfun time.”


  One Angel seems as if she’d like to call the whole thing off. We can’t see her face, only hear her tiny voice as she says, “I’m also nervous.”

Can you blame legislators, though? Why should they do anything? There’s no apparent public outrage. We don’t see crowds of people showing up at local governing bodies to vent their disapproval, as we did with the Second Amendment Sanctuary movement (not that all those resolutions really made a difference). We don’t see the business community exerting its considerable influence, the way we do on so many other issues (and that often does make a difference). Politicians notice these things. Fixing school disparity is a “heavy lift,” as they say, for both parties. Spending more money for anything goes against the Republican grain. Democrats aren’t so concerned about spending money but, realistically, this additional spending is going to come out of their constituents’ hides in Northern Virginia — and go to communities in rural Virginia that are, to paraphrase the great philosopher Taylor Swift, never ever getting back with Democrats again.

The goal is stability by increasing one’s downward force, and the examples Locker gave of surfers, skaters and skiers made perfect sense to me. I can easily recall my stable posture when I skated on ice or pavement or skied on water or snow: a semi squat with knees and ankles bent. Although I no longer attempt these sports at age 79, my ability to remain balanced and stable is more important than ever.


  As reported last year in The New York Times, between 2000 and 2016, the mortality rate from falls among those over 75 more than doubled. Locker calls this “a medical problem without a medical solution.” Rare is the doctor who prescribes postures and movements that enhance balance and stability. Yet, these are health- and life-saving abilities that can be improved regardless of a person’s age by strengthening the body’s postural muscles.

COLUMBIA, S.C. (WIS) - 12-year-old Caleb Maisonet witnessed his Mom being stabbed to death more than three years ago. His father is facing 25 years in jail without parole after being charged for her death. But despite seeing his mom die at a young age, Caleb believes things can always get better.“No matter what, if times are hard, if times are good, just know eventually things will get better for you as they did for me,” Caleb said.Caleb’s grandmother, Edna Eagles, took him in after his Mother’s passing, however, their support system is larger than just the two of them. After hearing about Caleb and Eagles, attorney Leslie Peters started a fundraiser to help the two make ends meet ahead of their first Christmas together in 2017. Peters quickly developed a tight relationship with Caleb and the two have been inseparable since.“Three kids ago when we started doing this it was just kind of, we found this wonderful family and saw the need and saw what they needed to get through life. I tried everything I could to help,” she said. “As we moved on and started to get to know each other, this became much less of a fundraiser and much more of a family,” Peters added.This year, Caleb and Eagles’ financial struggles are more severe than ever, in addition to living on a fixed income in the middle of a pandemic, Eagles was recently diagnosed with cancer and is still undergoing treatment. She is holding onto her faith as she fights to get better, and believes she has already been sent a helper from God to protect her and her family in these difficult times.“We wouldn’t have made it without [Leslie], we know God gave her to us. There is nothing phony about her. Nothing is prejudice about her. She is just a real, real person I gave her the name our angel and that is what she is in this household,” Eagles said.Sadly, Caleb knows even their family’s angel can’t give him what he wants for Christmas, his Mom back.“It doesn’t seem right not having my Mother with me to experience the same joys I am, but sometimes you have to take the good and bad to be happy in life,” Caleb said.But he is determined to pay it forward one day, to have a family of his own who will make the world a better place.“I want to make it up to them for being like this to me,” he said.This year, Peters set a fundraising goal for the family, which she has already raised. However, her work isn’t done. She has increased her goal in hopes of helping the family even more as they deal with increasing medical bills and try to have a merry Christmas.“We are not begging,” Eagles said. “We are just thankful.”To donate, click here.Copyright 2020 WIS.

We see another corollary between “the Babe” and today’s philanthropists as he told the story of the “Good Samaritan” and some say revolutionized charitable outreach. Oppositely, modernism has spawned Black Friday and rampant materialism, and many today are crying out for socialism and bridging income equality, something some believers think Jesus did through his lifestyle and “option for the poor” and sick.
 And shutdowns? Jesus had to deal with these all his short life with Roman oppression shuttering many Jewish synagogues and establishments. Nothing new here “God’s dealt with it before, especially as we consider how the Son was born” in a stable, outside opulent city gates.
 And then there’s that God and state tension. Initially, some rulers tried to block the Child and Christianity, and eventually succumbed. Today, a similar dissonance exists as Christians try to worship amidst COVID protocols while mayors and governors crack down, or succumb. Our future president is a church- goer and often wears a face mask and calls people to “trust science.” Meanwhile, as in other Bible stories, he is questioned about his consistency of practice and beliefs regarding his religion. Seemingly, no one is immune to the effects of Child virus.
 The “Child” and the virus have changed the world, each forcing everyone to take a stand on everything from quarantines and family gatherings to belief in God and the meaning of suffering. The key difference, though, is Jesus had a trace of virus-memory in his DNA as his ancestors survived the 10 plagues in Egypt and the dreaded Passover angel of death. And he still came into the world anyway, to transform any virus, or at least show it was not invincible, evidenced by Easter.
 So you can see how these themes of “the Babe” and Christianity are more probable or, even, historical, as we see some version of them repeated, morphing in our lives today and during this pandemic. Yes, since the Lord’s arrival and the virus’s, nothing will be the same with so much demise, and a lot of planetary and individual despair and tumult. As well as hope; as then, and now.
 Oh, P.S.: If you’re still wondering about repeats, think, also, of some who may want to “cancel Christmas.” There’s precedent. That was in the Bible, too, and that would be Herod. And so we may be wise to remember American philosopher George Santayana, who said, “Those who forget the past are bound to repeat it.”

I arrived in the US yesterday 15 Dec 2020 from Hong Kong to a very different scenario from the latter and of course from Sri Lanka where I had been up to October under full or partial lockdown. No denying the pandemic is ravaging the US; tens of thousands are infected every day, thousands dying. New cases last week averaged about 250,000 a day, and each day nearly 3000 die. The light at the end of the tunnel is mass vaccination and it is thought that by the end of March 2021 it will be possible to administer up to 50 million people both doses and half the population by the middle of next year.


--DocBreak--
2020 has certainly been a year for the books; one that has challenged our health, our thinking, and our collective will power as a global society. And though there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel with the first vaccines arriving in Georgia, I wanted to briefly address the thousands of inquiries that we are receiving about vaccine distribution in our state.


  I think I can speak for everyone when I say how exciting it is to see the first Georgians being inoculated. This major milestone provides much hope. But, as has been proven with every step of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are not out of the woods yet and there is still much to be done.


  Here is what we know thus far, from our partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Georgia Department of Public Health: First, roughly 84,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine have been deployed to Georgia communities, and even more across the U.S., with front-line health care workers and long-term care facilities being prioritized in this initial roll-out. Second, the Pfizer vaccine does require two doses to be effective, and those two doses must be spaced three to four weeks out from one another. So keep in mind that during this vaccination process, patients with the vaccine are still susceptible and should practice safety at all times. Third, the Moderna vaccine should obtain Emergency Use Authorization soon, and Georgia will receive around 174,000 doses of this vaccine in the next few weeks. The vaccine will be prioritized in the same manner, with the same requirement for two doses.


  Once health care workers and long-term care facilities receive the vaccine, Gov. (Brian) Kemp and Dr. (Kathleen) Toomey will work closely with health care providers and the CDC on how its remaining population is prioritized.

WATERTOWN, N.Y. (WWNY) - The Watertown Wolves provided an update on the status of the 2020-21 Federal Hockey League season Friday during a press conference at the Fairgrounds Ice Arena.The season, which has been delayed several times due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was set to start in mid-January is being pushed back once again, this time to the beginning of February.”Yeah, we proposed a schedule that’s basically based on playing each opponent only once and then playing a little bit more towards our closest opponents, which right now would be Elmira and Danbury, just to cut down on travel costs, cut down on the amount of COVID testing that’s needed, and just limiting the exposure really for the guys, plus allowing us to play more games. I mean, I think even over a 10 week regular season, we can get somewhere between 35 and 40 games,” said Watertown Wolves owner Andreas Johansson.That schedule would put the Wolves on pace to play 3-4 games a week, unlike the traditional Federal Hockey League season where teams play on Friday and Saturday nights.For the players, like Wolves captain Fred Hein, playing 2 or 4 games a week makes no difference as long as they’re playing hockey.”I think it’s great, personally. Like, let’s play. You know, everyone’s been practicing, everyone’s been training, you know, we wanna play games. So if it’s 2, 3, 4 games in a row, whatever the schedule is. Perfect, let’s play games, let’s get going. I think it’s great, you know, it at times will be tough on the body,” said Hein.Wolves Coach Brent Clarke knows the delay is a disappointment to Wolves fans, but says there are a number of reasons to push the start date back a couple of weeks.”You know, if it’s gonna be safest for us to start February 5th, lets say, then that’s where we need to go. That way, you know, it gives us more time A) to get vaccines out, B) to get all the protocols that we need to line up for our season to keep all the players safe, and then C) obviously, getting the fans in here cause that’s what drives us every night,” said Clarke.Besides announcing a delay to the start of the season, the Wolves also unveiled their new home and away uniforms for the 2020-21 season and announced that the Wolves Den Pro Shop will be open Monday, Wednesday and Fridays from 5-7 PM for fans to purchase new Wolves gear, which includes jerseys and equipment as well.“Fans can come in and buy not just jerseys but merchandise, tape, sticks. Really anything they want whether you’re playing hockey or you’re just a fan,” said Johansson.“We got hockey sticks that are $300 in the store and I’m selling them for $75 to a hundred. So I mean- and they’re brand new with the plastic still on them. I mean, you can’t beat that,” said Johansson.Copyright 2020 WWNY. All rights reserved.

New restrictions have been introduced in Quebec, Saskatchewan and Alberta in recent weeks, while other provinces like British Columbia and Manitoba have extended existing measures.
 The arrival of the first vaccine against COVID-19, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, has brought a glimmer of hope to the worsening situation. Thousands of people across the country have already received the first of two necessary doses during the first week of inoculations.
 Yet it's a light at the end of a very long tunnel. Pfizer's vaccine cannot be shipped to rural or remote areas due to its need to be stored at extreme freezing temperatures, requiring specialized equipment for shipping and storage. And it's only being administered to health-care workers and at-risk populations first before being rolled out to the general public later next year.
 Health Canada is close to approving a second vaccine, made by Moderna, that does not need to be frozen. That vaccine should fill the gaps left by Pfizer once it's given the green light, which is expected to come before the end of the year.

One thing that is pretty certain is that after this cold front passes, temperatures will plummet. Highs on Christmas Eve may not even break the 30 degree mark with partly cloudy skies. Wind chills will also add to the very cold temperatures. Single digit lows are not out of the question Thursday night. Into Christmas Day temps should warm slightly back into the 30's with mostly sunny skies but it will still be pretty chilly. Next weekend temps look to warm back to near average.

Bills, 50, who has worked in documentary films for 25 years, said that most of her projects of late have been on the depressing side. “I’ve been in prisons in Oklahoma or in OxyContin places or orphanages,” she said. “This was so special, and it felt so New York-y — and like the New York that I moved to when I was 18.”


  The plan was to cover a year in the life of the school, 2019-20, following the students on and off the Lincoln Center campus. Bills’ approach was to maintain a small, consistent crew “so that we could kind of disappear into the wall and not be such a presence,” she said. “I really wanted to capture the actual work that was going on and not be a distraction.”


  In preparation, she watched Frederick Wiseman’s ballet films, with their observational, fly-on-the-wall approach. “We obviously couldn’t be that silent,” she said, referring to the way Wiseman resists traditional voice-over and interviews in his films. “We had to provide some kind of narrative.”


  The solution was to have the students informally narrating their own stories in voice-over. “Dance is so beautiful,” Bills said, “you want to see it, you don’t want to talk it. That was my feeling.”


  There are multiple stories happening at once, but Bills leaves room for them to breathe as she cuts between the advanced division and the children’s division, whose students can perform in productions with City Ballet, including “George Balanchine’s The Nutcracker.” The older dancers, chosen from auditions held across the country and from the children’s division, focus on their training. The school’s mission? To produce dancers who will actually get jobs.


  Becoming a professional ballet dancer is arduous work. As Kay Mazzo, a former City Ballet principal who is chair of faculty at the school, points out early in the documentary, “Ballet is an unforgiving art form.”


  For Mazzo, the documentary shows what the school really is and what Balanchine, who died in 1983, left behind. “The manners, the respect — the respect he had for all the children,” she said in an interview. “The minute those elevator doors open, you’re somewhere where you respect everybody and you behave. You see those children pulling themselves together the best they can in those classes, the little ones _and_ the older ones.”


  What drives a child to dance? The students’ focus and commitment were two things that impressed Ron Howard, who founded Imagine Entertainment with Brian Grazer, when he visited the school. It’s not like “these students are going to wind up signing 10-year, multimillion-dollar contracts,” he said in an interview.

“I know the kids are excited,” said Brig. Gen. Tony Hale, the top soldier at Fort Huachuca, as he spoke to a handful of battalion commanders Friday morning at the Eifler Fitness Center on post.
 Fort Huachuca spokeswoman Tanja Linton said normally soldiers are given some leave time right after basic training and before they are sent into AIT at their respective installations. But because of the pandemic, most were sent directly to Fort Huachuca or other posts right after basic training.
 “We’re hearing from some of their parents on our Facebook page that they haven’t seen their soldier in almost a year, so the level of anticipation which is always high at Christmas is exponentially higher this Christmas,” Linton said. “The soldiers vary in age, but a lot of them are younger, so this may be their first experience being away from home.”
 For the past several months, AIT soldiers have been restricted to the installation. The last few days, they were kept in a “bubble” inside Prosser Village on post in order to keep them as healthy as possible before going home, Linton said. Soldiers were screened by nurses Saturday morning just before they hopped on their buses to the airport or were retrieved by a family member or friend at Fort Huachuca.
 “A number of things have been implemented here at Fort Huachuca by the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade,” Linton said Friday. “Prosser Village is primarily where our AIT soldiers live in their off-duty hours. We’ve asked that civilians not use the facilities here to kind of keep a safe bubble around them so that they don’t get COVID before they can go home.”
 The reverse will occur when the soldiers return from holiday leave, said Linton and Lt. Col. Wendy Gray, commander of the Raymond W. Bliss Army Health Center.
 Gray said AIT soldiers must do a health assessment five days prior to returning to Fort Huachuca from their leave. Col. Loren Traugutt, commander of the 111th Military Intelligence Brigade at the installation, sent letters to the families of each departing soldier informing them of the procedures that are expected and to “ensure that they’re (the families) partnered with his team to keep the soldiers safe,” Gray said.
 In their assessment, soldiers will have to determine how they’ve been feeling while on leave and whether they’ve had contact with anyone who may have tested positive for the virus, among other questions.
 “Once they come back if they’re showing symptoms, or if we have any suspicions, they’ll be set aside from the rest of the troops,” Gray said.
 Gray said soldiers can be tested at the installation with results available within a couple of hours.
 Hale, meanwhile, was pleased with what he saw Friday as he walked through the Eifler Fitness Center with Sgt. Maj. Jo Ventura informing him of the various checks each soldier would go through before leaving. Hale stopped at a couple of tables where soldiers would be asked on Saturday if they had the materials needed for their trip. One of those materials included a small card loaded with the phone numbers of drill sergeants, chain of command and medical personnel in case a soldier does not feel up to par during leave. A COVID-19 hotline number is on the card.
 The general said he and Traugutt spoke weekly about the holiday leave procedures. Hale said the “well-oiled machine” that took place Saturday had been in the planning for about two months, even down to the large goody bags filled with treats that each soldier grabbed before getting on their buses so they could have something to snack on during the bus ride to the airport.
 “This is a joyful time for the soldiers,” Hale said. “They get released from their drill sergeants and all the restrictions they’ve had here. They’re excited they get to go home and see family, for our country.
 “It’s absolutely necessary to allow these kids to go on holiday block leave to see their families. What we ask our soldiers to do, specifically over the last nine months, has been pretty hard. We’ve restricted them in ways that the American public is not restricted because it’s our job to execute our mission for the nation.”

Liberalism has lost its gloss. If neo-liberalism saw off European Communism, now neo-fascist right-wing populism is nailing down liberalism’s coffin. I say this with trepidation because populist neo-fascism is the far worse option. The basic values of liberalism such as equality before the law, freedom of speech and democratic and human rights are worthy principles. However, much prized liberty and equality before the law came, since the time of John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) liberalism’s most influential thinker, bundled with free- markets and with capitalism as the best of all possible systems. This bundle has broken asunder and the surge in neo-fascist populism, the Trump phenomenon included, is evidence that it has come unstuck. Biden has put together a progressive liberal team representing all shades of America but unless the team is prepared to go well beyond classical liberal mantras and take on radical measures it will not succeed in stemming a second stage of neo- fascism. If democracy were to fall in America, as sure as night follows day in short-order it will fall all over the world.

STARKVILLE, Miss.


  Will Rogers threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns to lead Mississippi State to a 51-32 victory over Missouri on Saturday.


  After weeks of floundering offensively, Mississippi State (3-7, 3-7 Southeastern Conference) finally got many of their young weapons working in tandem. The Bulldogs racked up 446 yards of total offense in the game, including a season-high 151 yards on the ground. Their previous high was 87 yards in a loss to Arkansas in the second game of the year.


  Missouri (5-5, 5-5) logged 342 yards of total offense, but many of them after the outcome of the game was already decided, and they turned the ball over four times. This is the second-straight .500 finish for the Tigers.


  Mississippi State led 27-10 at the half and Jo'quavious Marks punched in another score on the opening drive of the third quarter. Marks had 12 rushes for 70 yards. Jaden Walley led all receivers with five catches for 129 yards. Rogers was 21 of 36 and had one interception.


  For the Tigers, Conner Bazelak was 22 of 38 for 225 yards, two touchdowns and three interceptions. Larry Rountree led all rushers with 121 yards and two touchdowns.

From a purely writing standpoint, I’ve seen The Bucks continuously express that they wrote this on their iPhone in the middle of travel, booking, and wrestling, and while I’m sure they are touting this as an impressive feat, there are plenty of moments where this shows, and it’s not a compliment. Grammatically, it could have used another polish, and there were a few errors riddled within. However, I feel that this honestly makes it more real (at least in tone; spelling errors, I blame the editor). The book bounces back and forth between Nick and Matt’s POV, spending ample time with each, and it’s the conversation-like writing that really allows you to understand who you’re reading almost immediately. Matt takes a methodical approach, only boasting when he feels he needs to compare it to how he and his brother were treated, almost in an attempt to prove to himself and the reader that they did deserve better, and they worked hard for it. Nick, the not-so-confident behind the scenes, juggling with a “happy to be here” attitude and an “act like you belong” persistence, yet also ready to bang his chest in triumph over how good he was. The disparity is apparent and enjoyable.

In fact, demand for season tickets is up over last year, according to Hébert, who added sales were 20 per cent higher at the beginning of the second wave.
 "There are no other winter activities going on, and people wanna get out, he explained.
 Still, he said profits will likely be lower.
 "Season passes don't cover your whole manpower for a year," he said.
 Hébert explained that season ticket sales account for roughly half of the season's revenue, and with the new restrictions to control the number people gathering, they have stopped selling day passes.
 "So half of your business is going down," he said.
 Also, new COVID-19 red zone rules mean their boutique is closed and food services have been reduced to prevent people from gathering indoors.
 Hébert is predicting that business in the winter season could be similar to, or worse than, their summer figures.
 "The winter is a bit more of a challenge," he noted. "It's much more expensive. You have to make the snow, groom the snow, there's the electricity for the lifts."
 They've had to hire extra staff to enforce pandemic health regulations, he added.
