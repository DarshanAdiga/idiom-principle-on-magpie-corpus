Over 95 percent of our trade is through sea, yet Pakistani Flag carriers carry around 16 percent of our total seaborne trade. As the CPEC and Gwadar Port are set in motion, maritime activities in Pakistan are bound to increase manifold." There was a need to capitalize on the associated economic opportunities which would only be possible by developing our maritime sector. In this regard, declaration of 2020 as 'The Year of Blue Economy' by the government of Pakistan is a step in the right direction, he added.
 Pakistan Navy, besides fulfilling its core responsibility of seaward defence, is leading the way to create maritime awareness in the country and promote Blue Economy. Pakistan Navy is enhancing regional maritime security through continuous constructive engagements with international partners and by undertaking Regional Maritime Security Patrols. Coastal Security & Harbour Defence Force comprising a network of coastal security stations and a state of the art Joint Maritime Information and Coordination Centre at Karachi, duly supported by the Fleet, Pak Marines and SOF elements, are working day and night to ensure maritime security, maintain vigilance and respond to any emerging situation all along our coast.
 Pakistan Navy is laying special focus on reducing marine pollution and promoting safe and sustainable use of sea resources. Some of the major initiatives undertaken by PN over the years include construction of boats for collection of solid waste in harbour, establishment of sewage water treatment plants in all areas under its jurisdiction and refinement in SOPs to tackle oil pollution at sea. Pakistan Navy has also planted over 5 million mangrove saplings during the last three years along the coastal areas of Sindh and Balochistan to help protect marine ecosystems.

There's a lot to Pfizer beyond coronavirus work, of course, and that's what makes it a rather safe bet. Pfizer's main revenue driver is biopharma, with the segment bringing in $9.8 billion of the company's $11.8 billion in second- quarter revenue. Vyndaqel, a treatment for a cause of heart failure, and cancer drug Ibrance are among products that led the quarter's 6% gain in biopharma sales. Importantly, Pfizer has 89 programs in the pipeline, and 23 are in phase 3. Pfizer expects the pipeline to contribute to a revenue compound annual growth rate of at least 6% over the coming five years, and top-line growth beyond that point.

Beyond coronavirus work, Regeneron has six marketed drugs. They include Eylea for wet age-related macular degeneration and Dupixent for atopic dermatitis. Annual revenue has been on the rise since 2012, reaching more than $7.8 billion last year. And the biotech company's earnings have surpassed analysts' estimates for the past four quarters. Regeneron's pipeline of more than 30 programs, including nine in phase 3, makes me optimistic about growth years down the road.

 MILAN, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Shares rose and the dollar steadied at new highs on Wednesday, with overnight gains by Wall Street tech champions helping balance concerns that new restrictions to counter coronavirus infections will hurt the economic recovery.
 Renewed hopes of stimulus measures in Europe also came into play after surveys of private sector economic activity in September painted a gloomy picture for the region, with rising COVID-19 infections leading to a downturn in services.
 MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was 0.3% higher, while the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark progressively extended opening gains to rise 1.3%.
 Technology shares were among the strongest gainers from the start in Europe following a rally overnight in U.S. heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, and a positive performance earlier of peers in Asia. Tech companies have been rare beneficiaries of lockdown measures, with more people working and shopping from home.
 A rebound in beaten-down sectors provided extra support.
 Nasdaq futures meanwhile built on Tuesday's strong bounce to gain 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.4% higher.
 Carlo Franchini, head of institutional sales at Banca Ifigest in Milan, said that despite the gains the underlying mood remained highly cautions given uncertainty linked to the pandemic and its effect on the recovery.
 "The U.S. is the only market that's riding on. Investors are interested only in big U.S. tech, even though they should look elsewhere if they took fundamentals into account," he said.
 "Cornonavirus is a Damocles' sword for markets. If we continue with uncertainty over a possible vaccine, it's going to be a problem."
 UBS Asset Management said on Wednesday that an emergency approval of one to three COVID-19 vaccines was likely in the coming months, a milestone that could finally end the surge of mega-cap U.S. tech stocks.
 Purchasing managers' (PMI) surveys showed euro zone activity growth ground to a halt this month, throwing the recovery into question, as fresh restrictions to quell a resurgence in coronavirus infections sent the services industry into reverse.
 "It seems a W-shaped economic projection might be developing following the brief bounce in PMI numbers over the summer," said Charles Hepworth, Investment Director at GAM Investments.
 "What this means is that continued stimulus across the euro zone will be hopefully forthcoming -- or at least that's what markets are placing their bets on," he added.
 In Britain, the recovery from the coronavirus lockdown lost some momentum this month, according to a PMI survey taken before Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new round of restrictions that could probably last six months.
 Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3% for its first gain this week, but the mood was hardly bullish. Japan's Nikkei returned from a two-day holiday to slip 0.1%.
 In foreign exchange markets, the standout mover was the dollar, which surged to its highest level since July 27 against a basket of six major currencies before paring those gains to trade flat.
 "Risk-aversion on the back of new COVID-19 infections affecting Europe more directly remains an important factor this week," UniCredit strategists said in a note.
 "This means that the USD is likely to remain firm in its role as preferred safe-haven currency," they added.
 The euro was flat after rebounding from a two-month low hit on concerns about coronavirus infections and after the tepid European surveys.
 Commodities were weighed down by the robust dollar and worries linked to the economic impact of a second wave of COVID-19.
 Gold touched a six-week low as the dollar strengthened. Spot gold was last down 0.3% to $1,893.8 per ounce.
 Oil managed to reverse course and turn positive, helped by a report saying U.S. fuel inventories fell.
 Brent crude futures were last up 0.5% at $41.91 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped 0.3% to $39.92.
 Italy's 30-year bond yield fell to a record low of 1.76% as the country's debt remained supported after local elections reduced the risk of a snap national poll.
 U.S. bonds fell, with the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. debt up 1.3 basis point at 0.6773%.

Spain's Health Minister Salvador Illa on Tuesday called on Madrid residents to "limit to the maximum their movements" and restrict social contacts to the "essential" to reverse a surge in Covid-19 infections.
 The Madrid region has recorded 202,600 confirmed cases of the disease and 9,129 deaths -- in both cases a third of the national total.
 The areas affected by the new mobility restrictions introduced on Monday have all counted more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants -- nearly three times the national average, which in itself is the highest in the European Union.
 The parks there have been closed and cafes and restaurants must shut by 10:00 pm.
 Since the central government ended its state of emergency on June 21, lifting all national lockdown restrictions, responsibility for public healthcare and managing the pandemic has been left in the hands of Spain's 17 autonomous regions.
