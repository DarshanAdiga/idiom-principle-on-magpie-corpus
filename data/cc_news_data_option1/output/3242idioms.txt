 Klopp added that Tsimikas' signing was made with a hectic 2020-21 campaign in mind and to help protect his starting full-backs in the long term.
 "It will be the most intense season probably of our lives. And because of coronavirus, we cannot prepare perfectly for it because the market is not like this, nobody knows exactly how it will be in the next few months," he added.
 "I think we are all rather positive than negative about the situation in the world out there, but we still have to work on it and we still have to wait for the proper solution, which is not there.
 "I'm not sure we can cover each potential problem we have like this but this problem, I'm pretty happy with the solution.
 "Robbo and Trent [Alexander-Arnold], let's say, they cannot play every season 50-something games ‚Äì it would limit their careers, to be honest, even when they come through. So I'm really happy that we got this proper option and he is a proper option.
 "He's a super guy, a very confident boy, cheeky and if you want, watch him on YouTube ‚Äì probably most of our supporters did that already. I would say quite exciting."

But how much allegiance do any of them have to Biden, who has voted for one piece of legislation or another that each of these groups has reviled, who resisted the new progressivism until it became necessary to resist no more, who has the feel of a comfortable old shoe in an era when the new generation is casting away old shoes ‚Äî like House members Joseph Crowley of New York (defeated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), Michael Capuano of Massachusetts (toppled by Ayanna Pressley) and, last month, Eliot L. Engel of New York (upset by Jamaal Bowman)?
 ‚ÄúWho would have thought that some of these liberal stalwarts would be defeated, decisively, by new progressives?‚Äù former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, the party‚Äôs 1988 presidential nominee, asked in an interview.
 Then again, who in 1987, when the first (of three) Biden campaigns fell apart, would have guessed he would emerge a third of a century later as the putative savior of the Democratic Party?
 Of course, no one could have predicted the emergence of a playboy New York billionaire and serial bridegroom as the most important person of the age, the destruction of the international alliances and institutions that Americans built in an unprecedented global burst of truly enlightened self-interest, or the spread of a virus that would debilitate the world economy, imperil millions, kill hundreds of thousands, send people on all five continents to their living rooms, and threaten to wreck the greatest college and university system in the history of humankind, all in a few fevered, masked months?
 In that context, the future of the Democratic Party may seem like small beer, but it is this week‚Äôs beverage and we must drink deeply of it. For just as America is awakening to the fact that its strength as a civilization depends on a healthy Republican Party, its strength as a nation-state depends on a coherent Democratic Party, despite what Will Rogers said. (You‚Äôll have to look that up yourself. Your columnist can‚Äôt do everything for you.)
 Today Democrats are not united on much at all except for one very important thing: their desire to repel Trump from the presidency. To that end, they will swallow Biden as their nominee, though he has been a voice of moderation in an immoderate time, though he has supported initiatives that favor the very corporations the new Democrats revile, though he has shepherded through Congress legislation (on welfare, on crime) that his rivals in 11 debates forced him to repudiate.

While the weeping willow (Salix babylonica) is revered in folklore and remains available in the nursery trade, the diversity of our native willows is worth noting.
 In Mason County, I have encountered 12 species of native willows (Salix spp.), two which are large trees, one which is a small tree or large shrub, while the remaining willows are multi-stemmed shrubs.
 Willows, by and large, are typically associated with damp or wet habitats, ranging from roadside ditches to high quality bogs and fens. Our tree-sized willows include the widespread peach-leaved willow (Salix amygdaloides) and the more southern and less frequent black willow (Salix nigra), which is better known.
