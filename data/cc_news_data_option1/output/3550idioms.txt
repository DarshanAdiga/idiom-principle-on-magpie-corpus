This issue of accountability can be especially tricky for the high-profile individual sportspeople. We are all human. We all sometimes err but those in team environments, who are ultimately answerable to a manager as well crucially as team-mates, are surrounded by far more checks and balances.

We all are fervently hoping for Mr. Trump to be a one-term president.
 I had nearly given up hope that Republicans cared as I did about things like the good old American values of family, honesty, integrity, compassion, environmental issues. I have friends who are Republicans - good people. Why hadn’t I heard anything from them about children in cages, Russian interference in our elections today, exploding the deficit, racial injustice? Now more and more prominent Republicans, of the old Republican party, not the Trump party, are finally stepping up to voice their deep concern about the trajectory of America, domestically and abroad. These folks are as horrified and concerned about the above, plus lack of leadership with handling Covid19, testing, PPEs; 180,000+ Americans dead; the move to eliminate social security and Medicare; millions unemployed; our standing in the world and in the eyes of our allies and so much more.
 I am thankful they are out there helping to educate their fellow Republicans about the absolute seriousness of where we are as a republic - I do not want to live under autocratic rule. I do not want the People’s House for sale, anymore than our precious national parks and wildlife refuges. I don’t want more and more dividing of our citizenry through fear, but to find where we can come together. Work for real equality, real respect for one another and recognizing how diversity makes us stronger. I can’t be off the mark too much if all those high powered Republican strategists feel the very same.
 Two other important points. First, I agree with Joe Biden that we need to get the virus under control to get the country open again. From Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the CDC, now President/CEO of Resolve To Save Lives: “When we all wear masks, we are all safer. Masks are among the cheapest, simplest, most effective ways for countries to fight this virus and get the economy running again. Masks matter. Except in a few places, mask-wearing is the ‘new normal’ for the foreseeable future.” Please wear a mask. Help keep one other safe.
 Secondly, make a plan to VOTE. Send your ballot in as soon as possible to make sure it gets counted. Look for 24-hour ballot drop boxes in front of the library and the court house. Vote for America.

Lesser-known and lesser-used varieties of Portuguese and Egyptian lavender are from the western Mediterranean and seem to have a stronger, more distinctive scent than even the English lavender. These might be harder to find unless you go to specialty nurseries. Since much of our nursery shopping this year has been on-line, seeds or plants from reputable internet nurseries may be the way to go to find the Portuguese and Egyptian types.
 Lavenders can get pretty leggy if you don’t do a light pruning every other year. The pros say not to cut into the woody parts as they won’t regrow, but I have had success cutting a bit off the tops and a little into the wood. New leaves will grow lower on the plant in a few weeks.
 Another of my favorite Mediterranean plants is rosemary. Rosemary leaves are favorite culinary herbs as well as being used for medicinal purposes. It is considered a shrub and can grow to about 3 feet. But there is also prostrate rosemary that loves a good rock wall or large planter to hang from. Rosemary leaves can easily be dried for cooking, or used fresh. It is a great source of Vitamin B-6, calcium and iron and gives a nice flavor to chicken and fish. It also has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds and is said to be good for preventing memory loss. This from MedicalNewsToday.com: the aroma can improve concentration and mood and contains carnosic acid which may help brain health, especially in stroke victims. It is also pretty in the garden, easy to grow and smells good. What's not to like?
 Phlomis -or Jerusalem sage- is a fun plant to grow. These summer bloomers are native to Lebanon and Turkey and have green-grey leaves that look like sage but are not edible nor fragrant. They bloom with yellow or pink-mauve flowers on stalks and are an evergreen perennial shrub. They do like sun and well- drained soil, though, so add some sand or grit into the hole before planting. This shrub can get a little unruly but is easily pruned in the spring to keep them in control. The seeds can be harvested in the fall after they dry, or this can also be propagated by division in the spring.
 Looking to easily-grown Mediterranean plants can certainly add some interest and scent to the gardens even in a dry summer.

Labor Day ForecastLAKE CHARLES, La. (KPLC) - The forecast for your Labor Day, which has taken on a new meaning in SW Louisiana, will cooperate for continued clean-up and recovery efforts that are well underway across the area. Temperatures start off in the 70s this morning, warming into the 90s this afternoon. While no official heat advisory is in effect, heat index reading between 100 and 105 this afternoon will still create some hazards for those working outdoors and not drinking plenty of water and taking breaks.Heat Index TodayThere were a couple of isolated late afternoon storms on Sunday, and while that will again be possible today, chances of rain stay less than 20% overall. Temperatures this evening will drop back through the 80s and into the lower to middle 70s overnight. The upper level ridge weakens over the area starting Tuesday which will open up a better opportunity for scattered thunderstorms by the afternoon. Rain chances begin to increase to around 30% tomorrow afternoon and stay in place each day for much of the rest of the week.Tuesday ForecastUnfortunately, no big breaks in the heat as models had been teasing at a cool front but have now backed off on that for at least this week. The best hope of heat relief will be slightly less humidity and cooling showers and thunderstorms during the day. Even if you miss out on the rain, hopefully some added clouds at times will help with the heat. Lows at night in the 70s with daily highs in the 90s.Tropical OutlookThe tropics remain active but nothing threatening the Gulf of anywhere close to home for that matter. While Tropical Depression 17 has formed in the Atlantic and a new area is likely to develop near Africa, neither system poses a threat to the Gulf of Mexico and that trend should continue over at least the next 7 to 10 days.10 Day ForecastCopyright 2020 KPLC.

“But I’m just speaking from what I know. I know there are people who are lifeless when it comes to drugs and gang violence. I know this. But at the end of the day, there are people who want to get out of that situation and do not only better for themselves but for their families in the future. But if people aren’t listening, or they’re saying, ‘Oh, well they don’t care’ — no, it’s not that we don’t care. How do we fix it when we don’t have the support from the people we’re looking for support from?”

In 2016 the Internet Research Agency had an “overwhelming operational emphasis on race” that was apparent in the online ads it purchased — more than two- thirds contained a term related to race. The company targeted that content to “African-Americans in key metropolitan areas with well-established black communities and flashpoints in the Black Lives Matter movement,” according to a Senate Intelligence Committee report. One of its top performing pages, “Blactivist,” generated 11.2 million engagements with Facebook users.

Our nation is celebrating Labor Day with an even greater appreciation for the hardworking men and women of America. Our essential workers, in particular, have kept our nation up and running during unprecedented times.
 For the last six months, our front-line health care providers have worked tirelessly to save patients from the coronavirus. Grocery store workers, meatpackers and package delivery drivers could not telework. They answered our national call and went to work wearing face coverings and gloves to provide food security and needed supplies for their neighbors.
 As the principal deputy assistant secretary of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), I am reminded each day of the hard work and dedication exhibited by workers across this great country.

A fall campaign season where ethics was going to be one of the campaign issues took a new turn last week with the move by House Republicans to form a committee to look into House Speaker Michael Madigan's dealings with Commonwealth Edison.
   
 Madigan called the move a "political stunt" and issued a lengthy, strongly worded statement highly critical of House Republican Leader Jim Durkin.
   
 At the same time a special committee will be investigating Madigan, lawmakers expect to hold hearings on a long-awaited package of ethics reform measures that lawmakers from both parties have been demanding since three legislators in quick succession faced federal charges for a variety of wrongdoing. A fourth lawmaker has since been charged.
   
 House Majority Leader Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said last week the plan remains to have ethics reform proposals put out for discussion this fall with the idea the General Assembly could vote on them during the veto session. Harris is co-chair of the Joint Commission on Ethics and Lobbying Reform.
   
 Harris said he doesn't think the activities of the Special Investigating Committee looking into Madigan will have any effect on the ethics reform proposals. Although the commission hasn't met in months, Harris said it had already accumulated testimony from various interest groups that will be used to help formulate ethics recommendations.
   
 He also doesn't expect any potential partisan rancor over the Madigan investigation to carry over to the commission's work.
   
 "On the ethics commission, the Republican members, the Democrat members, the public members, we've all worked very well together and very collaboratively," he said. "Obviously, there will be potentially some differences on what the end product should be, but I don't think the other activities will impact our working together."
   
 Just how the committee investigating Madigan will work is being developed. A first meeting is planned for Thursday. Committee Chair Rep. Emanuel "Chris" Welch, D-Hillside, said he's not sure how many times the committee may meet or how long the process will take.
   
 "Number one, our guiding post has to be that Speaker Madigan, just like any other member of the House, is entitled to due process and a fair process," he said. "What that looks like we don't know. We have to discuss this as a group."
   
 ComEd agreed to pay a $200 million fine after federal prosecutors charged the utility with one count of bribery. They said ComEd gave contracts and jobs to Madigan associates in an attempt to curry favor with the Speaker. The bribery count will be dropped in the future if ComEd continues to cooperate with prosecutors in their on-going investigation.
   
 Madigan has not been charged with anything and has denied any wrongdoing.
   
 Like Harris, Welch doesn't think the Madigan investigation will get entwined with the work of the ethics commission.
   
 "It is two separate committees. We are going to follow the House rules for this special committee," Welch said. "I believe those are two separate things."
   
 With the committee evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, it is unlikely the votes will materialize to take action against Madigan. Even if the committee were to recommend charges, the issue goes before another panel which decides if it should go to the full House. Finally, it would take a three fifths vote of the House to reprimand or censure Madigan and a two- thirds vote to expel him.
   
 Retired University of Illinois-Springfield political scientist Kent Redfield said he's not even sure what kind of case House Republicans will be able to make against Madigan. The U.S. Attorney's office has said it is continuing to investigate political corruption issues. When news of the investigating committee surfaced, Durkin said the U.S. Attorney's office was notified of it and that it will not interfere with the federal investigation.
   
 Based on that, Redfield said he's not sure where the House committee investigation is headed.
   
 "It's not clear to me what they are going to look at or who they're going to talk to," Redfield said. "The U.S Attorney doesn't want the ComEd people answering questions and going on the records on things that might come up in some kind of trial."
   
 He said it is doubtful that any potential targets of the feds will want to testify to state lawmakers about things federal investigators may be interested in. Moreover, a defense attorney wouldn't allow a client to put himself in jeopardy by testifying, he said.
   
 "I'm not sure what happens with this beyond a flurry of headlines before the election," he said. "If you could get the speaker in there to take the Fifth Amendment before the election that would not be good. But I don't know how they make that happen."
   
 Rep. Tim Butler, R-Springfield, said there are more than headlines to be had from the House investigation.
   
 "I wouldn't be surprised if there's ethics related legislation that comes out of that," he said. "I certainly think the potential is there to have bi- partisan legislation (from the hearings)."
   
 At the same time, Democrats have to be careful in how they approach the issue, Redfield said. They can slow-walk the proceedings and have people complain about their tactics or they can bring people in and watch them plead the Fifth Amendment.
   
 "It does put the Democrats in a double bind," said Redfield. "They're either going to look like they're obstructing things or the people under suspicion are going to have to refuse to cooperate."
   
 The offshoot of it all may be to motivate Democrats to an even greater degree to get behind meaningful ethics legislation. Redfield said it would be an important step toward rehabilitating the party's image in the wake of four Democratic lawmakers facing federal criminal charges in a little over a year and the cloud now hanging over Madigan.
   
 Whether it gets done during the veto session is unclear given the push by the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus to pass comprehensive legislation promoting racial equality and criminal justice reform. But Redfield also said it could be an effective first act for the General Assembly that is seated in January.

LONDON (AP) — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange appeared in a London court on Monday to fight a U.S. extradition request at a high-stakes hearing that was delayed by the coronavirus pandemic.Assange, who has spent almost a year and a half in a British prison, sat in the dock at the Old Bailey criminal court and formally refused the U.S. demand he be extradited to face trial on espionage charges. He wore a dark suit, white shirt and maroon tie, with glasses perched atop his neatly trimmed white hair.Several dozen supporters, including fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and Assange’s partner, Stella Moris, gathered outside the courthouse, chanting, banging drums and calling his prosecution a threat to press freedom.“Julian Assange is the trigger, he is shining the light on all the corruption in the world,” Westwood said.American prosecutors have indicted the 49-year-old Australian on 18 espionage and computer misuse charges over Wikileaks’ publication of secret U.S. military documents a decade ago. The charges carry a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison.American authorities allege that Assange conspired with U.S. army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer and release hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables and military files on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a new indictment filed in June, U.S. prosecutors also say he conspired with members of hacking organizations and sought to recruit hackers to provide WikiLeaks with classified information. That indictment expanded the U.S. case against Assange but did not add any new charges. Assange’s lawyers say the prosecution is a politically motivated abuse of power that will stifle press freedom and put journalists around the world at risk. They argue that Assange is a journalist entitled to First Amendment protection, and say the leaked documents exposed U.S. military wrongdoing. Among the files released by WikiLeaks was video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.“Journalists and whistle-blowers who reveal illegal activity by companies or governments and war crimes — such as the publications Julian has been charged for — should be protected from prosecution,” Assange attorney Jennifer Robinson said before the hearing.Assange’s legal troubles began in 2010, when he was arrested in London at the request of Sweden, which wanted to question him about allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women. He refused to go to Stockholm, saying he feared extradition or illegal rendition to the United States or the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.In 2012, Assange sought refuge inside the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he was beyond the reach of U.K. and Swedish authorities — but also effectively a prisoner, unable to leave the tiny diplomatic mission in London’s tony Knightsbridge area.The relationship between Assange and his hosts eventually soured, and he was evicted from the embassy in April 2019. British police immediately arrested him for jumping bail in 2012.Sweden dropped the sex crimes investigations in November 2019 because so much time had elapsed, but Assange remains in London’s high- security Belmarsh Prison as he awaits the extradition decision.Supporters say the ordeal has harmed Assange’s physical and mental health, leaving him with depression, dental problems and a serious shoulder ailment. The hearing is expected to include expert psychiatric evidence about his mental state.Journalism organizations and human rights groups have called on Britain to refuse the extradition request. Amnesty International said Assange was “the target of a negative public campaign by U.S. officials at the highest levels.”The extradition hearing opened in February but was put on hold when the U.K. went into lockdown in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It is resuming with social distancing measures in court and video feeds so that journalists and observers can watch remotely.The case is due to run until early October. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser is expected to take weeks or even months to consider her verdict, with the losing side likely to appeal.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
