I stopped at our favorite burger drive-in the other night and ordered a gallon of root beer to take home. The root beer no longer comes in a plastic gallon jug (used to be glass jugs years ago) but a plastic bag with a lid protruding from the side, Lynda said it looks like something you’d get at the hospital after a surgery. The root beer is still amazing but it’s weird serving it from a bag. Blame it on 2020?
 College football has been cancelled this fall, which will have long-lasting effects on the towns, cities and communities where they play. And even though high school play continues, the atmosphere just feels different.
 The changes to the start of the school year have been massive and constantly changing. Should we or shouldn’t we do this, that, or the other? Our district has chosen to have kids attend regular school days with measures put in place to ensure the safety of every one attending. Teachers (in my opinion) are “between a rock and a hard place” — excited to get back to doing what we love most but worried for our own health as well as the health of the kids. My first contract day back to school brought up more questions than answers as our faculty discussed at length solutions to dozens of tricky problems. I equate it to taking a bunch of 5-year olds to the beach and telling them not to get wet or get sand in their shorts. It just ain't happening!
 In my file drawer at school I have a folder labeled “First day stuff” that contains a list of about 75 things that need to be done before school starts. This year I’ve changed or omitted over half of those tasks simply because we can’t safely share and co-exist in the classroom or school like we have in the past.
 As school begins, whether you’ve decided to homeschool or attend face-to-face, please be patient with us. We’re once again breaking new ground, and stress levels are approaching Defcon 4. We’re all in this together, so dig deep and be kind.
 Maybe one last relaxing camping trip up north in the great outdoors is in order. After all, I've never seen a real bison up close before.

I am neutral on NeoPhotonics. The company may be underestimating the full impact of Huawei. It expects only a limited impact when it could be far greater. The U.S. government is making sanctions on Huawei more stringent all the time. It's possible NPTN may not be allowed to do any business with Huawei at some point. NPTN seems to be counting on Huawei to stick around, but that's not a given.
 If Huawei decides the time has come to go in another direction for whatever reason, NeoPhotonics may have to more than double its revenue just to break even. Even if it succeeds in doing so, it's going to take a substantial amount of time. In the meantime, NeoPhotonics is likely to see its top and bottom lines shrink. The opposite of what used to happen when headline numbers and the stock itself got a boost from Huawei stocking up on inventories. The stock is unlikely to do well under such conditions.

DHHS said 1,001 North Carolinians are currently hospitalized with illnesses related to COVID-19, down 25 from Tuesday.
 The 980 hospitalizations count on Sunday was the first time since July 7 that there have been fewer than 1,000 hospitalizations.
 However, DHHS cautioned Monday that "hospitalization data from a large health system were not received by the deadline for today’s report, so hospitalization numbers will look artificially low for both the state and the Mountain Area Healthcare Preparedness Coalition region."
 DHHS reported 91% of hospitals statewide reported COVID-19 data Wednesday.
 ## COVID metrics
 On Aug. 5, Gov. Roy Cooper extended the state’s Phase Two reopening restrictions a third time, until Sept. 11, to allow selective reopenings to begin, such as in K-12 public schools.
 The Phase Two restrictions, which Cooper calls a “safer-at-home” approach, began May 22. Private bars, fitness centers, bowling alleys, gyms and other businesses remain closed under the restrictions.
 The Cooper administration is monitoring five public-health data points: number of hospitalizations; number of hospital beds, ICU beds and ventilators available; number of positive cases; percentage of positive cases; and number of individuals coming to hospital emergency rooms with COVID-19 symptoms.
 Dr. Mandy Cohen, the state's health secretary, said Thursday that, overall, the five metrics have either stabilized or are on slight downward trends so far in August, although still at elevated levels.
 She said testing turnaround times have improved to a two- to three-day window in more instances.
 Statewide, the percentage of tests coming back positive has hovered between 7% and 10% since mid-May.
 However, it was as low as 5% on Aug. 10 and was at 7% on Wednesday.
 Sen. Jim Burgin, R-Johnston, asked Cohen during a joint legislative healthcare oversight committee meeting on Aug. 11 if reaching a 5% positive rate is the linchpin for moving the state into Phase Three of reopening.
 Cohen called it good news that the state has lowered its positive testing rate but she cautioned that she wants to see at least a seven day average at 5% — and preferably a 14-day average — before considering it a leading indicator of less COVID-19 in North Carolina.

Residents of South Dakota’s largest city are mourning an urban cornstalk that briefly became a lighthearted beacon of hope during the coronavirus pandemic.
 The Argus Leader reported Wednesday that the stalk had been growing up through a crack in the concrete at the intersection of 57th Street and Minnesota Avenue on Sioux Falls’ south side. Dubbed the 57th Street Corn, complete with its own Twitter account during its brief lifespan, the plant was a symbol of resiliency and hope as the pandemic rages on, Mayor Paul TenHaken said.
 “Finding joy in the small things will continue to help us get through what has been a challenging time in our country,” the mayor said. “It was ‘amaizing’ to see the community rally around the 57th Street corn as a sign of hope over the past few days.”
 Residents reported Wednesday morning that someone had ripped out the lone stalk, prompting an outcry on social media. Someone attached a sign to a traffic post where the stalk grew that reads “CORN RIP.”

WORCESTER - A federal grand jury has indicted an Uxbridge man on an allegation that he threatened to extort an out-of-state judge, prosecutors announced Wednesday.
 Keith Lessard, 40, was indicted for allegedly trying to extort money from a West Virginia county judge who had prosecuted him in 2010, Mike Stuart, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Western Virginia, said in a news release.
 Court documents show prosecutors allege Lessard, whose lawyer said he has mental health and substance abuse issues, repeatedly sent emails falsely accusing the judge, who was not named, of misconduct when she prosecuted him in a forgery case in Kanawha County, West Virginia.
 Lessard pleaded guilty to the associated charge and was sentenced to 1 year of probation, records show. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail the next year after committing probation violations, records show, including by using methamphetamine.
 According to the FBI, Lessard in 2019 began a campaign to extort money from the prosecutor, who is now a judge in the county, by alleging to expose her for allegedly committing prosecutorial misconduct. The FBI said the man alleged the judge once admitted to him that his rights were violated.
 The judge told FBI agents the conversation Lessard referenced in his communications never occurred. Among the demands Lessard made was a $200 million settlement he alleged someone else impersonating him had already negotiated with the government.
 The FBI said Lessard sent a letter to the judge's home through a delivery service, detailing his allegations and telling her that "someone's wallet or purse is going to have to take a pretty nice sized hit.
 "Good news is that's the only thing that has to happen & it can be done very quietly, secretly and peacefully," he allegedly wrote.
 Lessard is charged with one count of mailing interstate communications intended to extort money by threat to injure the reputation of a person.
 "Lessard now faces two years if convicted of this scheme that targeted a judge," the U.S. attorney said in the news release. "Threats of any kind are taken seriously and investigated, especially when those threats target a member of the judiciary."
 Court records show Lessard was ordered held without bail as dangerous Aug. 13 after a hearing in U.S. District Court in Worcester, in which his lawyer, Timothy G. Watkins of the federal public defender's office, asked that he be released on the condition he undergo substance and mental health treatment.
 Magistrate Judge David H. Hennessy denied the request, remarking, court records show, that it was an "extremely close call."
 Watkins could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday.

And right now, situation is that number out there is growing by leaps and bounds, shelves being emptied, ammunition being manufactured at home...and all manner of people are doing it.

We don't, of course, know when "normal" will return. Major League Baseball has already released a full schedule for 2021 and there is certainly a chance that that schedule will be followed. But there is also a chance that spring training and possibly the season, itself, could be delayed as the nation tries to pull itself out of the pandemic. There is a chance that some Covid-related restrictions will still apply whenever it does start.


  In other words, 2021 might not be a normal year. It might be a year in which temporary changes — at least some of them — will still apply. We might not get a "normal" season until 2022.


  But at some point we will get a normal season. At some point baseball is going to play a 162-game season that follows a full spring training. When that happens we'll see how "temporary" this year's rule changes will be.


  I strongly suspect that at least one change — the universal designated hitter — is here to stay. The National League teams have put up very little resistance to the rule and — so far, at least — it hasn't appeared to hurt them competitively. Through Tuesday, NL teams actually held a 60-59 edge in interleague play.


  There are probably several NL clubs that would support a rule making the DH permanent and behind the scenes I would expect Commissioner Rob Manfred to throw his weight behind the movement. I consider myself a purist and hate to see it, but I can read the tea leaves.


  The expanded playoffs are another part that I think will extend, in some form, beyond the pandemic. We might not see a continuation of the 16-team tournament that is slated for this year, but I wouldn't expect to see a return to the 10-team postseason that begins with a pair of wildcard games. I think something in between is probably in the offing — perhaps a 12-team format that begins with four best-of-three wildcard series.


  The extra-inning rule — the one that calls for a runner to be stationed at second base at the beginning of the 10th inning and beyond — might be a bit trickier but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if that becomes a permanent part of baseball.


  The rule has its roots in NCAA women's softball, where a talented pitcher can dominate a game and two talented pitchers can prevail for an eternity unless the offenses are given an artificial boost. Minor league baseball copied the rule in order to ease the pressure on pitching staffs and decrease the chance of a lengthy game on a travel day. Now, for the first time, it's being used in major league games, ostensibly to save the arms of over-worked and under- trained relief pitchers.


  Some players — from losing teams, of course — have complained bitterly but the Players Association, itself, voiced no objection. There were certainly no complaints from the owners, who consider long games to be economic losers. When games run long — especially night games — most of the fans leave the ballpark and a significant portion of the television audience abandons the game. Nevertheless, the owners are stuck paying their gameday staffs and cleanup crews for extra hours on the job.

Tesla is a great example of how passive funds have destroyed the efficiency of the market. Its share price is up over 800% this year, not because its business prospects have improved - in fact its sales have been in decline since Q4 2018, but because the market knew that four straight quarters of profit would qualify it for inclusion in the S&P500. This would mean that the S&P500 passive funds would all have to blindly buy it regardless of its economic fundamentals and so the speculators tried to front-run the passive funds in order to make a fast buck. And this is what I mean by a negative feedback loop which is caused by passive funds and which is destroying he efficiency of the market.
 The other issue with passive funds is one of concentration risk. As we learned earlier, the Fabulous 5 are only 1% of the S&P500 by number of companies, but they are 25% of the index by value. And so if you switch your investments from an actively managed fund with a diverse portfolio of good value companies into a passive S&P500 fund, you will find that 25% of your money is invested in just five companies. Now multiply that by the tens of millions of investors who have switched to passive investing and you have trillions of dollars, 25% of which is now invested in only 5 companies! Is it any wonder that these companies have market caps of well over $1 trillion USD? It is not about how good these companies may be or about their future prospects, it is all about passive funds blindly inflating market prices and distorting the market.
 And so you can see how passive funds have contributed to the S&P500 being at over valued levels that we see today. Regulators really ought to sit up and take notice because their remit is to ensure the efficient functioning of markets and to mitigate systemic risks. I would argue that they have dropped the ball on this one!
 ## Conclusion
 The S&P500 is, by any measure, off the scale in terms of being over valued.
 My calculations suggest that fair value is in the 1,600 to 1,800 range rather than the 3,386 that it is at the time of writing. In the interests of brevity I shan't go into my valuation methodologies but if you are interested in equity valuation techniques I cover them in great detail in my book "Success in the Stock Market".

“We are very grateful for these additional PPE items from the state, which will support our efforts for a safe and lasting return to the classroom when the time comes,” said Jordan Korphage, director of communications at OPS.


  The district delayed the start of classes until Monday, Aug. 24, and transitioned solely to distance learning after Superintendent Amy Fichtner gave the green light on Aug. 4 to cancel in-person teaching due to COVID-19 concerns.


  Korphage said the state’s endowment will help bolster OPS’ growing inventory of protective gear and cleaning supplies, at least for administration and staff during this time, but eventually for all the students once they return to their respective campuses.


  “Before receiving this PPE, we felt like we had sufficient supplies to support our students and staff,” he said. “We’ll use materials as needed, and we’re confident that our PPE inventory will be sufficient for when in-person instruction resumes.”

We're seeing more antiviral products popping up that claim to protect you against COVID-19.


  Pakistan-based denim company Artistic Denim Mills is making pants and masks using antiviral technology it says tested nearly 100% effective in 30 minutes against coronavirus.


  Denim brand Diesel is planning to add different antiviral technology to its jeans next year that it says can disable nearly all viral activity within two hours of contact.


  Other companies are selling antibacterial gloves that claim to destroy bacteria and micro-organisms.


  These are big claims, but are they true?


  “The people that we shouldn't trust, honestly, are the people that stand to gain financially from this,” said Dr. Mark Shrime, a professor at Harvard Medical School. “Not because they're necessarily nefarious, but they have an ulterior motive to market these products to our uncertainty and to our fear without necessarily doing the due diligence that we might want them to do in less uncertain times.”


  Shrime says we don't know a lot about how COVID-19 spreads on surfaces. There are no confirmed cases of surface transmission so far.


  He questions if these products actually do anything for you.


  “For sure, they haven't been rigorously tested,” said Shrime. “You will see things often that they have been scientifically formulated or other words like that, that make it sound like this is super cool, but they haven't necessarily been rigorously tested to see if they actually prevent the virus.”


  He points to antibacterial soaps that were all the rage for a while. The Food and Drug Administration later said they're no more effective than regular soap and water.


  He says instead of paying extra for what companies say is extra protection, focus on what we know works – wash your hands and wear a mask.

Discrimination in home lending goes back to the beginning of home lending itself. During the last housing boom, when subprime mortgages were all the rage, predatory lending to minority borrowers was rampant. When the mortgage market came crashing down, taking the economy with it, some major lenders were held accountable. They ended up paying massive, multibillion-dollar settlements to the federal government. But there is clearly still bias in the market.

At the age of 54 he probably shouldn’t have been risking life and limb against Shawn. But, hey, his son needed the help.

And when boxing is over we’re still father and son and love each other.”
 Boxing isn’t over just yet, even though Porter lost his 147-pound title last September in a competitive and entertaining fight against Errol Spence Jr. But at the age of 32, he’s been fighting as a pro for 12 years now and his aggressive, all-out style is not conducive to a long career.

In light of recent concerns about whether the U.S. Postal Service would be able to handle a larger-than-normal number of mail-in ballots, should that occur in the upcoming national election, my husband and I will be voting in person. That way we know that our ballots were received on time, and it also takes the onus off the post office.


   


  I urge everyone to do the same. Be smart, mask up and go to your polling place Nov. 3. Hopefully every polling location across the country will be available on that day, unlike during some states' primaries when a number of polling places were consolidated, thus forcing voters to have longer waits and increased risk of COVID-19 exposure. Anyone who plans to send a ballot in by mail is urged to do so promptly (unfortunately there will be no way of knowing whether it actually arrived). Be sure that your vote counts; go to your polling place in person.

The S&P500 is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. More than $11.2 trillion is indexed or bench-marked against the S&P500. The index includes 500 leading companies and captures approximately 80% of available U.S. market capitalization. Therefore it is quite representative of the entire stock market.
 Intuitively, one would be forgiven for thinking that a stock market index and GDP should grow at a similar pace, but the S&P500 is a price index in contrast to a total return index. Said differently, it does not include dividends, which explains why since 1871 the index has under-performed the overall economy. It also explains why it ought to always under-perform the economy. However, not only has the S&P500 recently been keeping up with the economy, in 2019 it outpaced it by a whopping 787%.
 The index logged an increase of 31.5% in 2019. By comparison, the combined businesses that make up the index saw their revenues and profits climb by only 4% per share, less in dollar terms due to fewer shares outstanding at the year end because of buy-backs, but don't get me started on that subject! Using the logic that stock prices track earnings over time, this appears to be an unsustainable situation.
 You may be thinking to yourself that 2019 was an extraordinary year and that the market will mean revert over the longer term, but you would be wrong. The index continues to nudge all time highs despite Covid19 having created an economic recession so deep that we have not experienced anything on this scale since the great depression of 1929. More particularly, the pace of growth seems to be accelerating. In July 2020 the monthly return of the S&P500 was 5.51% which is 66% on an annualized basis. Even without the CoronaVirus induced recession this is historically excessive as becomes evident when you compare it to a monthly return of 1.31% a year earlier and against the long term monthly average of 0.45%.
 Does any right thinking individual honestly believe that 80% of listed US companies by market capitalization increased in value by 5.51% during the month of July having already increased in value by 31.5% during 2019? If this continues investors will double their money every 18 months. On that basis do you think that this is sustainable?

The company posted a value of $1.75 as earning-per-share over the last full year, while a chance, will post $3.02 for the coming year. The current EPS Growth rate for the company during the year is 50.00% and predicted to reach at 179.00% for the coming year. In-depth, if we analyze for the long-term EPS Growth, the out-come was 26.10% for the past five years and the scenario is totally different as the current prediction is 11.31% for the next five year.

What had been expected to be a very quiet summer transfer window for Arsenal is becoming busier by the day.


  The Gunners have secured the signing of Willian on a free transfer and they are also set to land Gabriel from Lille as well.


  Another piece of good news that is in the pipeline is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang signing an extension to his current expiring deal.


  The Gunners will not want to lose their captain for anything and I have a feeling that they are making these signings to impress the former Borussia Dortmund man.


  As an Arsenal fan, I am also very happy that we are making these signings but strengthening our defence and attack isn’t enough and I hope that after completing these moves, we can turn our attention to our midfield.


  The Arsenal midfield needs to be strengthened and it has become even more important to do that now that we have lost Dani Ceballos as he returns to Real Madrid.


  The likes of Granit Xhaka and Joe Willock are worthy members of the team with the latter only a youngster that should get better.


  However, Mesut Ozil and Lucas Torreira don’t inspire confidence and they show just why it remains important for us to get new midfielders.


  If we don’t strengthen our midfield, we will still struggle despite adding new defenders and attackers.

 The officers let Smith go and he declined to wait for an ambulance, walking away clutching his wrist.
 Wheeler’s actions “were objectively reasonable” and did not deprive Smith of any constitutional rights, attorneys James Thagard and Matthew Lawrence said in a court filing Tuesday.
 They also noted, as did lawyers for Valdosta’s mayor and police chief in a separate legal filing, that no disciplinary action was taken against Wheeler. In fact, his attorneys said, the police department promoted Wheeler from sergeant to lieutenant at some point after Smith’s injury.

A small but growing body of evidence shows that COVID-19 can damage the heart, sometimes fatally, even in a previously healthy young athlete.


  This frightening fact is shrouded in so many unknowns that even expert medical groups can offer only limited guidance. That’s why collegiate athletic conferences, professional sports leagues, and high school teams are debating what to do. The Big Ten Conference’s debate ended with a decision to err on the side of caution.


  “We just believed, collectively, there’s too much uncertainty,” Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren said Tuesday in explaining why the conference decided to suspend all fall sports competition.


  Here are some of the questions medical and sports authorities are grappling with.


  What is myocarditis? Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle, or myocardium, usually triggered by infection with a virus, including germs that cause the common cold. The inflammation is generally mild and goes away with rest. But it can also cause temporary or permanent heart problems, notably abnormal rhythms, progressive heart failure, even sudden cardiac death.


  How does the coronavirus damage the heart? The exact mechanisms are unclear, but studies suggest an immune system overreaction or an autoimmune response (a self-destructive attack on healthy tissue), or both.


  It is also possible that the virus directly invades heart cells in the same way it invades the lungs, by binding to a protein called ACE2 on the surface of cells. This direct attack was seen in patients with MERS, a previous disease caused by a new coronavirus, but so far the evidence on COVID-19 is scant.


  Are athletes at risk of COVID-19-related heart damage? They clearly are, but no one knows the level of risk.


  In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, myocarditis is relatively common — affecting 7% to 23% of intensive care patients, studies suggest — and dramatically increases the risk of death.


  A disturbing finding is that heart inflammation can persist after recovery from coronavirus infection. A study conducted in Germany and published in July in JAMA Cardiology evaluated 100 recovered patients; 60% had evidence of ongoing myocarditis.


  In athletes, myocarditis — whatever the cause — is rare, yet studies suggest it is a significant cause of sports-associated sudden cardiac death in players under age 35, accounting for 9% of these shocking cases.


  During the pandemic, there have been news reports linking COVID-19 to cardiac damage or death in athletes. Michael Ojo, a 27-year-old former Florida State basketball player, collapsed and died last week during training in Serbia. He reportedly had tested positive for COVID-19 and recovered. Myocarditis has been found in at least five Big Ten athletes and several players in other conferences, according to ESPN.


  “Whether or not it’s 1% or 10%, it’s still important,” Jonathan Drezner, director of the University of Washington Medicine Center for Sports Cardiology and a consultant to the NCAA, told ESPN.


  How is myocarditis diagnosed in athletes? Some colleges have started screening athletes for the condition, but their methods vary, and diagnosis can be difficult.


  Athletes may have mild or no symptoms of heart inflammation until it’s too late. They may have mild or no symptoms of COVID-19 infection even as it injures their hearts.


  “There are reported cases of sudden cardiac death in non-hospitalized COVID-19-positive individuals with only mild symptoms,” the European Society of Cardiology wrote in a recent paper on returning to sports after COVID-19 infection.


  A blood protein called troponin is elevated in people with heart inflammation, but it can also rise with intense exercise.


  “COVID-19-associated injury and its long-term consequences in athletes could be significantly underestimated if the assessment is defined merely by the presence of elevated troponin,” the society advised.


  Tests including an electrocardiogram and an echocardiogram can help with diagnosis.


  How is myocarditis treated? In many cases, myocarditis improves on its own with rest. However, it can be unpredictable, and even before the pandemic, it posed treatment challenges.


  In patients hospitalized with the condition, rigorous studies have shown steroids and other immune-suppressing drugs do not help.


  Standard heart-failure drugs and supportive care such as pain relievers are the mainstay of treatment, but even with these, patients “can clinically deteriorate or develop end-organ dysfunction,” researchers wrote in an article on COVID-19 and myocarditis published last month in the journal CJC Open.


  Can athletes return to sports after COVID-19 infection? That may be the only question tougher than whether to suspend sports in the first place to avoid an outbreak among players.


  In May, three sports cardiology specialists offered “a game plan” for return to play that was published in JAMA Cardiology and endorsed by the American College of Cardiology’s sports and exercise cardiology council.


  In a nutshell, the plan recommends that athletes with asymptomatic, mild, or moderate COVID-19 be monitored for heart problems and swear off exercise for at least two weeks. Players who need hospitalization and develop myocarditis that does not resolve should follow existing guidelines for athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities.


  The experts acknowledged that their proposed approach is subject to change, “given the clinical uncertainty” and unanswered questions.

But it’s still a skunk.
 I SAW A BULLY BUG a while back. We have several kinds of flowers and herbs that attract a lot of flying insects. They rarely interfere with each other and they avoid collisions and confrontations in an amazing display of social distancing.
 But one big black flier I haven’t seen before was the exception. It would sit on the rock wall or hover over the flowering mint until a bee or other insect would alight on a blossom and then knock it off and feed there. I waited to see if anything would happen. It did.
 The orange-headed bully bumped several bees, then tried the same stunt with a yellow-banded black wasp. The wasp moved elsewhere. Then the intruder did the same thing to the same wasp. The wasp, as the old saying goes, killed the bully dead as a hammer.

Typically the corn fields surrounding the dairy farm near our home start ripening as the stalks approach 10 to 12 feet in height, signaling the start of the silage harvest. The ride to school on the motorcycle gets progressively chilly and the kids can start to see their breath as they stand waiting for the buses to arrive. The record amount of hail and rain that pummeled some areas in Smithfield (our home included) a few weeks ago turned streets into rivers, turned gardens, trees and shrubs into plastered bits of green Swiss cheese, and transformed the acres of developing corn east of us into shredded, naked stalks resembling not so much corn, but scraggly sugar cane. Chalk it up to the madness of 2020, right?
 Leaves on some sections of our apple tree and shade trees have started turning color much earlier than usual and are even dropping some of their foliage across the lawn and flower beds. Over a thousand wildfires have decimated areas of the state and destroyed homes, structures and thousands of acres of our beloved mountain wilderness as a result of lightning and irresponsible “stupid human tricks.”
 Recreation areas statewide have seen record numbers of folks escaping the cities to the solace and cooler temperatures of the mountains which has created its own challenges for officials as traffic, littering, illegal off- road travel and fireworks have increased significantly. With more people traveling through state parks, national parks and national forests, the number of encounters (not good ones) with wildlife have increased as well, and I can’t watch the news without nightly reports of someone walking up to bison, bear or elk in Yellowstone or other wilderness areas wanting to take a picture and pet the cute, fluffy cow. “Oh look! It has babies” Ha! More 2020 craziness.

“And that there’s no way we made this decision without everybody being clear on what the decision was.”


  Franklin might have been referring to Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren, who announced on Aug. 11 that the conference was postponing football and other fall sports because of the coronavirus pandemic.


  That announcement came six days after the Big Ten rolled out a revised football schedule, which included 10 conference games for each team. Reports began to surface three days later that the conference was moving towards postponement.


  “I don’t really have an issue with the decision,” Franklin said, “because at the end of the day we made a decision based on what we thought was in the student-athletes’ best interests from a health and welfare standpoint. Everybody understands the magnitude of the decision.


  “But I think, as I’ve stated before, my issue has been the process and timing of it, not necessarily with the actual decision that was made.”


  Franklin said he was not satisfied with the communication between the Big Ten office and Penn State, especially leading up to the decision.


  “When the decision was actually being made, it caught a lot of people off guard,” he said. “Because at that time, we felt like things were going pretty good. We felt like we were going to be able to make this thing work and things changed quickly.

DAKAR, Senegal - Tuesday's stunning coup in Mali - in which mutinous soldiers stormed the capital and arrested the country's president - has opened a power vacuum that West African leaders sought to avoid, injecting instability into the heart of the fight against the world's fastest-growing Islamist insurgency.


  Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta's sudden ouster this week thrust the nation into chaos as it struggles to repel fighters loyal to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The militants have expanded their territory in the countryside during the pandemic, analysts say, despite military intervention from France and the United States.


  The coup leaders revealed the first steps of their takeover on Wednesday on state television, pledging to build a civilian-led transition team, maintain ties with international partners and hold a new election.


  "We can restore this country to its former greatness," said Col. Maj. Ismael Wagué, a spokesman for the mutineers, without specifying candidates or a date for the election.


  It was a dramatic cap to a turbulent two days in the country of about 20 million, after soldiers swarmed the capital on Tuesday morning and, by the evening, arrested Keita and other top officials.


  The embattled leader's removal followed weeks of protests in Bamako led by the influential imam Mahmoud Dicko, who said again on Wednesday that he would not be seeking office.

Bailey and the Raiders were able to fill their schedules with some different invitationals as well as a tri-meet in Vermilion, while the Rangers are planning on filling their schedule with tri-meets against fellow Southwestern Conference Schools.


  “The SWC is working on a tri-meet schedule with other SWC teams and we’re excited about it since it’ll give us more opportunities to race against conference teams,” Dohanos said. “For us, that’ll also give us an opportunity to see where we stand in the district since a lot of the top teams in our district come from the SWC. That’s still up in the air. I think right now they’re looking at course availability.”


  When races do start, it seems as if almost all of them will go with a modified “pod” start where runners are divided up into small groups and run the course at different times, a far cry from the normal pack start that’s a staple at races.


  “We’ve been stressing that it all comes down to the runner,” North Ridgeville girls coach Linda Morales said. “There’s a chance they could be on the starting line with 30 kids and none of them will be at their pace, but they’ll still need to go out and give their 100%. I think having all these challenges has really helped a lot of their confidence and helped them develop that intrinsic motivation. We’ve been focusing a lot on getting our runners to push themselves and focus on their mental strength since that’s going to be huge this year.”


  The staggered, pod start could also help reduce fans clumping up at the start and finish of races. The lack of runners on the course could present another challenge, however, as that could mean that more runners are grouping up and moving along the sideline to cheer on teammates, something that would need to be limited in today’s era of social distancing.


  “I think what’ll be interesting is how we manage teams as spectators,” Dohanos said. “You get parents of course but most of the time the biggest cheering sections we have are the athletes not running in a race moving around to cheer their teammates on. I haven’t heard anything about what the plan is to restrict movement of athletes moving around so I don’t know how that’ll work.


  "We were usually only getting parents and close friends anyway. So I don’t how much that’ll change the number of spectators, but I think right now the biggest thing is managing the number of teams.”


  With the scheduled start of the season less than a week away, coaches and race directors are working to make sure that teams are able to safely start the season on time. And while that can be a stressful undertaking, everyone knows it’s better than the alternative.


  “It’s been stressful but kind of in a good way since everything we’re going to is to make sure that kids are safe and that we can have a season,” Morales said. “In a normal season we would have spent the summer telling kids they needed to get ready to run in big packs but now we’re scratching all of that. We’re kind of changing we’ve ever thought about in terms of competing and training and having to go back and totally change my mindset. We have to think outside the box and think of new ways to do things, it’s kind of like remaking the whole wheel.”

“I think the whole thing is overblown and it’s really because I don’t think it’s going anywhere," Peterson said. "It's not going to go anyplace, it’s just going to cause more heat than light and we’ve just got to quit doing this, we don’t need this. We need to figure out how we’re going to work together."
 Peterson said he suspected the comments from Trump were meant to pull focus from other issues, like his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic response. And he said much of his district had voted fully absentee for years without issues of fraud. Members of the Democratic caucus, meanwhile, were too quick to "tilt at windmills," rather than taking up bipartisan proposals, he said.
 He also said he has qualms with federal COVID-19 response funding that gave stimulus checks to Americans that make less than $75,000 and the $600 weekly unemployment benefit, which ran out last month. Trump has sought to extend $300 benefits by executive order.
 "I just don't think we have the money to be doing that," Peterson said.
 And Peterson expressed pessimism about legislative leaders reaching a deal that could pass both chambers any time soon. He said he continued supporting funding for pork and turkey producers and ethanol plants.

WILMINGTON, Del. — Kamala Harris is poised to make history on Wednesday as the first Black woman to accept a spot on a major party's presidential ticket, a moment intended to galvanize Democratic voters heading into the fall campaign against President Donald Trump.
 This will be her second time speaking to the Democratic National Convention. But the stakes are higher than ever before as Harris tries to unite the party behind Joe Biden, while also introducing herself to a national audience that may be tuning into the campaign for the first time.
 “For somebody with her wealth of background and experience, she's still fresh. She's still new,” said Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus who endorsed Harris' 2020 presidential primary run before throwing her support behind Biden in March. “I think people are looking for that.”
 Harris will be introduced by her sister, Maya, and her niece Meena, as well as Ella Emhoff, her stepdaughter. The senator's advisers say Harris will tell her story while highlighting the examples and experiences of others,
 “I hope that they see themselves in her when they hear her speak,” Mari Urbina, national director of Indivisible, a progressive advocacy group, said of young first- and second-generation immigrants across the country. “And that they are motivated to understand that, not only do they have to be part of getting us out of this nightmare, but that they also can feel part of this historic change that we’re all about to embark on.”
 Harris also plans to describe a nation where everyone is welcome and entitled to equal opportunity and legal protection, and make the case that Biden is uniquely qualified to lead the country, aides say.
 In a virtual address Wednesday to the convention's Asian American and Pacific Islander Caucus, Harris said she would deliver her speech “knowing that I stand on the shoulders of so many people who are on this call and those who came before us.”
 The daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, Harris has shined in key moments before.
 She was lauded for drawing a crowd of 20,000 to the announcement of the start of her presidential campaign in Oakland last year. Her subsequent tough questioning of two Trump nominees, Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court justice and Bill Barr for attorney general, during Senate confirmation proceedings was a similar high point, as was her broadsiding Biden during a debate over his opposition to busing in the 1970s to integrate public schools.

SPRINGFIELD - State and local officials in the Metro East area near St. Louis cautioned residents on both sides of the Illinois-Missouri line Monday to be diligent about protecting themselves and others from COVID-19.
   
 "It is in the best interests of all St. Louis and Metro East residents, Illinoisans, and Missourians alike, to take action now to bring down the positivity rate," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said during a news conference in East St. Louis. "And we're working together across the border to make sure that that happens."
   
 Pritzker's comments came one day after the Illinois Department of Public Health announced new social and economic restrictions for the six-county area in the wake of the region's rising number of cases and test positivity rate.
   
 He was joined at the event IDPH Director Dr. Ngoki Ezike, St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern, East Side Health District Administrator Elizabeth Patton Whiteside and East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III.
   
 Eastern recently recovered from COVID-19.
   
 "I was diagnosed positive on July 13," he said. "I was OK, feeling-wise. That Wednesday (July 15) hit me like a ton of bricks. I never felt that bad in my life. I was scared not knowing what the outcome may be."
   
 Eastern noted that the city of East St. Louis recently enacted a mandate that all individuals within the city limits wear a face covering whenever they are outside of a private residence.
   
 "East St. Louis, I ask you to stay patient and to take proper safety measures so we all can start focusing back on rebuilding a new normal," he said.
   
 As of Friday, Aug. 14, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, that region had experienced nine consecutive days of rising positivity rates, including four consecutive days of rates above 8 percent. The rolling seven- day average positivity rate stood at 8.9 percent.
   
 "If you haven't been taking this seriously yet, now is the time to start," Pritzker said. "Wear a mask to maximize the chance that children can have in- person learning this fall. Maintain six feet of physical distance to keep the small business owners' dining rooms open and retail stores in business. Each of us has a role to play in the future of this region's health and economy."
   
 The new mitigation efforts are not as severe as those that were in place statewide during Phase 3 of the reopening plan, which ended June 26. But they are more stringent than those that have been in place during Phase 4. They include requiring bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m. and limiting seating in those establishments to six people per table.
   
 Bars are being told to seat people only at tables and to remove bar stools to prevent gathering around the bar.
   
 Elsewhere, public gatherings, meetings and social events will be limited to 25 guests or 25 percent of the overall room capacity. All reception halls will be closed and party buses will be shut down.
   
 Casinos are being ordered to close at 11 p.m. and are limited to 25 percent capacity.
   
 Those restrictions will remain in place for at least 14 days, which is the average incubation period for the virus. If the test positivity rate does not fall below 8 percent during that time, IDPH said more stringent measures will be imposed, possibly including the closure of bars and restaurants
   
 "On the flip side, if the positivity rate falls below 6.5 percent, on average, these new mitigation measures will be removed and this region will return to Phase 4 of the Restore Illinois plan," Pritzker said.
   
 Metro East is the first of the state's 11 regions to reach the resurgence levels that trigger new restrictions. The region consists of Bond, Clinton, Madison, Monroe, Randolph and St. Clair counties.
   
 Communities in the region include Alton, Belleville, Collinsville, Columbus, East St. Louis, Granite City and Scott Air Force Base.
   
 Officials have attributed much of the increase to cross-border travel to and from St. Louis, where mitigation efforts have been less strict than in Illinois since the start of the pandemic.
   
 In addition to the new measures in the Metro East region, IDPH also issued a COVID-19 travel advisory map on Monday, as well as guidance for people traveling domestically or internationally. The map shows states with an average daily case count 15 per 100,000 population or greater. Illinois is at 14 cases per 100,000 population.
   
 The documents do not restrict Illinoisans' travel but offer advice about the places that pose the highest risk and how to stay protected while traveling.
   
 "We know that people may have to travel," Ezike said, "but potentially based on where you may go, that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19 by putting you in contact with people who have a higher chance of having the virus."
   
 IDPH also announced Monday that the state had recorded 1,773 new cases of COVID-19 over the previous 24 hours. That followed 1,562 cases reported Sunday and 1,828 on Saturday. That brought the statewide total number of cases since the pandemic began to 207,854.
   
 IDPH also reported 35 additional virus-related deaths since Friday afternoon, bringing the statewide total to 7,756.
   
 Laboratories have processed just over 3.4 million COVID-19 tests. The single- day statewide positivity rate on Monday was 4.6 percent. The rolling seven-day average positivity rate was 4.2 percent.

Many details regarding the shooting that occurred last month remain up in the air, but so, it seems, are Megan Thee Stallion’s spirits. The “WAP” rapper hit a strip club with Akbar V and Asian Da Brat, where she was clearly impressed by the ladies’ moves as she doused them in dollar bills. Although Megan looked to be having a great time, it was clear that her left foot was in a bandage. Thee Stallion has yet to confirm that it was Tory Lanez who shot her last month, but it is pretty evident once the puzzle pieces have been placed together.

“No. The APC cannot participate in the re-run election. The Lyon-Degi- Eremienyo ticket was declared invalid by the court. It remains so. But I foresee a lot of re-alignments. Even without a candidate in the election, the APC is not likely to fold its hands. The party can align with one of the other political parties, put up a proxy candidate on that other platform and give the PDP a serious fight. The APC will certainly see this as an opportunity to take Bayelsa back. Once their proxy candidate wins, the deed is done. One or two months later, the new Governor will simply jump ship and join the APC. Simple.”

It’s not just counselors who try to paint all sides as equally wrong. It’s trendy to do in regular conversations. This is especially true when it comes to political discussions. Right now it’s extremely trendy and considered “woke” if you are so wise to say, “Both Republicans and Democrats are wrong.” You might even see yourself as a modern day Sage if you say such things.


  Yet, it’s often not true, and it can be very counterproductive to say it is when it’s not.


  However, I’m about to identify a problem which is one associated with both parties, but in this case I believe both actually are wrong. Sure, one party is currently whining more than the other, but both are wrong on this one – and that is not a logical fallacy. It’s based on the facts – just the facts.


  Concerning Washington state politics, I keep hearing how upset Republicans are that there are only Democrats, now in the running for Lieutenant Governor in the general election in November. They’re upset because they believe Governor Inslee proved he doesn’t want to be governor since he ran for president, and hopes for an appointed position under Joe Biden if Biden wins the presidency. That would necessarily at least temporarily put into position the Lieutenant Governor by state law (A special election could ensue, but an acting governor would have the best chance of winning that.). Since we only have two key people, both Democrats, running for Lieutenant Governor, it appears unless Culp beats Inslee, Washington will remain governed by a Democrat no matter what. This has seriously upset some Republicans in our state who feel like they aren’t getting fair options.


  So? The Republicans are just as loud as the Democrats when it comes to fighting primaries with ballots requiring voters to declare their party affiliation. In my mind the Republicans made their bed, and now don’t like the way they made it.


  It’s unfortunate voters don’t understand how primaries are supposed to work. Primaries are supposed to help each major party pick the candidates which will represent them. That’s the main purpose of primaries.


  It only makes sense that Democrats don’t get to pick their opponents and neither do Republicans. So, primaries are supposed to be the way voters pick their party’s candidates for the general election. However, if the voters rise up and war against that kind of primary, they defeat the purpose and outcomes they actually want.


  If Republicans would like a candidate for Lieutenant Governor to run in the general election, they shouldn’t fight against a primary election system which allows them to do just that. If they hadn’t demanded they shouldn’t have to declare their political party preference for selecting candidates in the primaries, they would have a candidate in that race this November. I believe the Democrats are just as guilty in demanding such things, and certainly doing things the way we’re doing them benefits the Democrat party right now. Republicans, however, are hypocritical for whining they don’t have a candidate in the Lieutenant Governor’s race.

EL DORADO--For five months, it's something every player and coach had hoped would happen. It did happen on Monday evening at respected high schools from around the state.


   


  This week was the official start of high school athletics fall season.


   


  Five months and six days since the cancellation of high school sports in March have led to this moment. Coaches around the state have been taking the extra precautions all summer to make sure their players are safe in hopes of being able to play on Friday nights.


   


  "You know, we had pretty tight restrictions all summer," El Dorado Head Coach Wes Bell said. "I think for our guys it's becoming second nature."


   


  With the start of high school athletics, it appeared to be a little different. Players regulated players to spread out in El Dorado, forcing "split" sized gaps, which is approximately three yards, or nine feet, from one another.


   


  "Our players are a little older than last year and it's showing through their accountability," Bell said.


   


  In Augusta, players were told hats on or masks on. There was no option as the coaching staff quickly kept players in line. It's something they had done all summer. Players are buying in and understand what is at stake.


   


  "We're the luckiest kids in the state," Augusta coach Jason Filbeck said. "We're still going to get play football."


   


  Questions remain about how COVID-19 will affect the high school fall sports season and how and if there will be games. KSHSAA has stated over and over their intent to have games played. They are leaving it up to the counties to make the best decisions for their districts.


   


  In Wyandotte County and in Kansas City, there will be no athletics in the fall, due to the large number of outbreaks in that area. Coaches in Ford County are still working to address how to handle the situation in their own neck of the woods where COVID-19 clusters once reigned but seem to have subsided.


   


  "We just want to hopefully play our games," Bell said. "Our guys understand what we have to do to get there."

In principle the concept is attractive. Low fees and tracking the market takes the pain out of investment decisions. But please bear in mind that a fund which tracks the market and then deducts fees will mathematically always under perform the market – so if you are seeking alpha, passive investing is not for you.
 In any event, the principal of passive investing relies upon passive funds only being a small proportion of total investing activity. The theory is that active investors do all of the hard work analyzing corporations and placing their money in the most promising companies – the good investments will then be pushed to the top of the pile being more heavily weighted in the indices. The passive funds simply piggyback on the hard work of the active investors by tracking the index, without doing any analytical work themselves, and so avoid analytical expense which benefit is passed on to investors in the form of lower fees. Great in principle, but then some might argue so was Marxism! Neither is good in practice.
 Allow me to explain the issue. What happens when the passive funds start to dominate? The theory completely breaks down. Now instead of the dog wagging its tail, the tail is blindly wagging the dog.
 Now, rather than the passive funds being able to piggy-back on the work of the active fund managers, instead now passive funds have created a negative feedback loop whereby they are all piggy-backing each other!
 A passive investment manager allocates capital blindly. As investors deposit money into the fund on a regular savings basis the passive fund buys shares in the constituent companies that make up the index being tracked regardless of fundamentals. So if one of those companies has an unrealistic price to earning ratio the fund manager still buys it. And that pushes the price higher and so the price to earnings ratio becomes more unreasonable. And then the next passive fund buys it and it goes up further, and so on and so forth, up and up and up. This is how shares like Tesla trade on PE multiples of over 900 – no rational active fund manager would ever invest in that because it implies an earnings yield of 0.14% with a whole heap of risk attached – you would be better off buying the 10 year Treasury which yields 0.69% risk free!

  I urge everyone to do the same. Be smart, mask up and go to your polling place Nov. 3. Hopefully every polling location across the country will be available on that day, unlike during some states' primaries when a number of polling places were consolidated, thus forcing voters to have longer waits and increased risk of COVID-19 exposure. Anyone who plans to send a ballot in by mail is urged to do so promptly (unfortunately there will be no way of knowing whether it actually arrived).

SPRINGFIELD - State and local officials in the Metro East area near St. Louis cautioned residents on both sides of the Illinois-Missouri line Monday to be diligent about protecting themselves and others from COVID-19.


   


  "It is in the best interests of all St. Louis and Metro East residents, Illinoisans, and Missourians alike, to take action now to bring down the positivity rate," Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said during a news conference in East St. Louis. "And we're working together across the border to make sure that that happens."


   


  Pritzker's comments came one day after the Illinois Department of Public Health announced new social and economic restrictions for the six-county area in the wake of the region's rising number of cases and test positivity rate.


   


  He was joined at the event IDPH Director Dr. Ngoki Ezike, St. Clair County Board Chairman Mark Kern, East Side Health District Administrator Elizabeth Patton Whiteside and East St. Louis Mayor Robert Eastern III.


   


  Eastern recently recovered from COVID-19.


   


  "I was diagnosed positive on July 13," he said. "I was OK, feeling-wise. That Wednesday (July 15) hit me like a ton of bricks. I never felt that bad in my life. I was scared not knowing what the outcome may be."


   


  Eastern noted that the city of East St. Louis recently enacted a mandate that all individuals within the city limits wear a face covering whenever they are outside of a private residence.


   


  "East St. Louis, I ask you to stay patient and to take proper safety measures so we all can start focusing back on rebuilding a new normal," he said.


   


  As of Friday, Aug. 14, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health, that region had experienced nine consecutive days of rising positivity rates, including four consecutive days of rates above 8 percent. The rolling seven- day average positivity rate stood at 8.9 percent.


   


  "If you haven't been taking this seriously yet, now is the time to start," Pritzker said. "Wear a mask to maximize the chance that children can have in- person learning this fall. Maintain six feet of physical distance to keep the small business owners' dining rooms open and retail stores in business. Each of us has a role to play in the future of this region's health and economy."


   


  The new mitigation efforts are not as severe as those that were in place statewide during Phase 3 of the reopening plan, which ended June 26. But they are more stringent than those that have been in place during Phase 4. They include requiring bars and restaurants to close at 11 p.m. and limiting seating in those establishments to six people per table.


   


  Bars are being told to seat people only at tables and to remove bar stools to prevent gathering around the bar.


   


  Elsewhere, public gatherings, meetings and social events will be limited to 25 guests or 25 percent of the overall room capacity. All reception halls will be closed and party buses will be shut down.


   


  Casinos are being ordered to close at 11 p.m. and are limited to 25 percent capacity.


   


  Those restrictions will remain in place for at least 14 days, which is the average incubation period for the virus. If the test positivity rate does not fall below 8 percent during that time, IDPH said more stringent measures will be imposed, possibly including the closure of bars and restaurants


   


  "On the flip side, if the positivity rate falls below 6.5 percent, on average, these new mitigation measures will be removed and this region will return to Phase 4 of the Restore Illinois plan," Pritzker said.


   


  Metro East is the first of the state's 11 regions to reach the resurgence levels that trigger new restrictions. The region consists of Bond, Clinton, Madison, Monroe, Randolph and St. Clair counties.


   


  Communities in the region include Alton, Belleville, Collinsville, Columbus, East St. Louis, Granite City and Scott Air Force Base.


   


  Officials have attributed much of the increase to cross-border travel to and from St. Louis, where mitigation efforts have been less strict than in Illinois since the start of the pandemic.


   


  In addition to the new measures in the Metro East region, IDPH also issued a COVID-19 travel advisory map on Monday, as well as guidance for people traveling domestically or internationally. The map shows states with an average daily case count 15 per 100,000 population or greater. Illinois is at 14 cases per 100,000 population.


   


  The documents do not restrict Illinoisans' travel but offer advice about the places that pose the highest risk and how to stay protected while traveling.


   


  "We know that people may have to travel," Ezike said, "but potentially based on where you may go, that travel may increase your risk of exposure to COVID-19 by putting you in contact with people who have a higher chance of having the virus."


   


  IDPH also announced Monday that the state had recorded 1,773 new cases of COVID-19 over the previous 24 hours. That followed 1,562 cases reported Sunday and 1,828 on Saturday. That brought the statewide total number of cases since the pandemic began to 207,854.


   


  IDPH also reported 35 additional virus-related deaths since Friday afternoon, bringing the statewide total to 7,756.


   


  Laboratories have processed just over 3.4 million COVID-19 tests. The single- day statewide positivity rate on Monday was 4.6 percent. The rolling seven-day average positivity rate was 4.2 percent.

What has been gained from all this disruption? Trump said he was putting America first, but what, exactly, have Americans gained? After browbeating allies to spend more on their own defense, the United States has spent vastly more on defense in the past three years. North Korea is more dangerous now than it was three years ago. Even before the pandemic, U.S. farmers were on the government's dole and we were in the middle of an industrial recession due to Trump's trade wars. The president's biggest foreign policy success is striking a better deal on postal rates. So yes, we are sick and tired of all the winning.
