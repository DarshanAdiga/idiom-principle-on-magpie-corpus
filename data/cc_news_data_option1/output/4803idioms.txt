THE agency tasked with giving the green light to Covid-19 vaccines across Europe has pledged to thoroughly scrutinise their safety and effectiveness for different demographic groups. The head of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) told the Irish Independent that it will thoroughly examine the scientific data as a third major medical company reported positive news on a vaccine.&ldquo;Our job is to look at the application and decide whether there is a positive benefit risk,&rdquo; said EMA executive director Emer Cooke. &ldquo;We will outline the indication for the vaccines for the type of population it shows positive outcomes for.&ldquo;So if it&rsquo;s the elderly population, the paediatric population, or people with comorbidities, these are things we&rsquo;ll be looking at to see if there is sufficient data to support that in the dossier.&rdquo;It raises the prospect that those most vulnerable to coronavirus will only be recommended for immediate access to the forthcoming vaccines if the scientific data shows it works best for them.However, the final allocation and deployment of vaccines is decided at the member-state level by a national immunisation committee.Europeans could have access to the first doses of a Covid-19 vaccine very soon under an accelerated pandemic drug-approval process at the EMA, according to Ms Cooke, who took up the new job last week as Moderna announced it had a vaccine that was 95pc effective&ldquo;I think we are going to be very close,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Assuming everything is positive – and we have to look at the data to be sure – but best case, we could have a scientific opinion by the end of the year.&rdquo;EMA scientists have already begun a &ldquo;rolling review&rdquo; of data from clinical trials conducted by Moderna, Pfizer and the latest by Oxford/AstraZeneca. Ms Cooke said the aim was to reach a positive recommendation on a similar timeline to the FDA in the US, which is expected to have a verdict in mid-December on Pfizer&rsquo;s proposed vaccine.Pfizer announced two weeks ago its vaccine was 94.5pc effective. Oxford/AstraZeneca announced yesterday that it had a vaccine with effectiveness ranging between 62pc and 90pc, depending on dosage.The rolling reviews allow the authorisation process to run alongside clinical trials and before large-scale production or post-authorisation studies, which typically must be completed before a new drug is marketed.That means the EMA could quickly give its scientific opinion for the European Commission&rsquo;s marketing authorisation, allowing manufacturers to distribute new vaccines as soon as they are produced.&ldquo;These have been developed very quickly, which is very promising from a scientific perspective, but it means there is a lot of attention on the results and we have to make sure we evaluate those as efficiently as we can without compromising our usual scientific standards,&rdquo; said Ms Cooke.The EMA is also embarking on a public communications campaign to engage sceptics and encourage take-up once a vaccine is available.The agency has organised a virtual public meeting on December 11 and is inviting submissions and questions from interested members of the public and representative groups to address their concerns.&ldquo;We have recognised the exceptionality of this disease and the need for greater public engagement,&rdquo; said Ms Cooke.&ldquo;We want this to be a two-way dialogue, we want to hear what the concerns are, to explain what the process is.&ldquo;We think it is very important that the community has trust in the regulatory system.&rdquo;

 In addition, Karvy Stock Broking has been expelled from the membership of the exchange, the NSE said in a circular.
 The move effective from November 23, was taken as the broker failed to comply with NSE guidelines, it added.
 Under the guidelines, stock brokers are required to fulfill their obligations and should not involve in any misconduct, or unprofessional conduct among others.
 Earlier, Karvy had unauthorisedly transferred securities of clients into its demat accounts by misusing the PoAs (Power of Attorney) given by its clients.
 In November 2019, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had barred Karvy from taking new brokerage clients after it was found that the brokerage firm had allegedly misused clients' securities to the tune of more than Rs 2,000 crore.

Mark Barford, who police say is a member of the Descendants outlaw motorcycle gang, was caught after officers attempted to serve him with a firearms prohibition order in December last year.In a bail application on Tuesday, the Adelaide Magistrates Court heard he has now spent nearly a year behind bars and should be released for reasons including his deteriorating health.Nick Vadasz, for Barford, said his client’s explanation for his actions was “nowhere near as sinister as the prosecution wishes to accept”.The court has previously heard officers rang Barford’s mobile and heard him tell his son, Adam, to remove a black and gold package from under the tree and hide it in the toilet of their home in Adelaide’s northern suburbs.When members of the Crime Gangs Taskforce arrived at the house, they found Adam Barford in the bathroom holding his phone in one hand and the package, with a revolver inside, in the other.They also allegedly uncovered methamphetamine, ammunition, an expandable baton and a crossbow hidden at the property.The pair is yet to enter pleas to multiple drug and firearms offences.While Adam Barford, 19, has been released on bail, the court heard his 57-year-old father must prove there are special reasons why he should be freed. Mr Vadasz said his client’s mental health had been deteriorating since he believed his son had been killed in a serious motorbike accident in mid-2019.“You’re dealing with a person who is being treated for serious psychological issues,” he said.“Whilst he has been painted as a member of an outlaw motorbike gang, he has had a lifelong interest in motorbikes, he’s never been in trouble, he was in full-time employment his entire life, (a) family man.”He said Mark Barford’s physical health was also declining, and he could not be adequately treated in prison for issues including arthritis, cirrhosis and nerve damage.But prosecutor Taryn Amos said Barford did not meet the criteria to be granted bail.“He has already been refused bail once on this file,” she said.“Other than the passage of time, I don’t see there’s really any difference to the arguments that were led.” Magistrate David McLeod ordered a home detention bail report. The case will come before the court again early next month. Mental health support

Prince William has come all guns blazing against BBC over Princess Diana’s Panorama interview and will not slow down until justice is served.  
 According to a source, the Duke of Cambridge will ‘not rest’ until his late mother gets justice after allegedly being exploited by host Martin Bashir over the infamous interview.
 “William will not rest in his quest to get justice for his mum. After all, as a teenager he witnessed a lot of her trauma and tears over her marriage and the tit for tat media game she was involved in,” the insider revealed to New Idea.
 “It is seared into his memory in the most painful way. What is poignant is that he used to join forces with Harry on anything to do with protecting their mum’s legacy and memory,” they went on to say.
 “But this time, it was noticeably only his name and his words on the statement. It is very sad they can’t even meet in the middle over standing up for Diana, but it’s an indication of how deep their falling out runs,” they said.
 “If they cannot come together in honour of Diana, it’s hard to see what might reunite them,” they added.

Just over a month after Jeromy Lee Harris pleaded guilty at Brisbane District Court to being an accessory after the fact to grievous bodily harm and three counts of supplying dangerous drugs, he was no closer to being sentenced on Tuesday.Proceedings were adjourned until Friday as legal practitioners exchanged barbs through the morning over the particulars of Harris’ case, including the date range of his charges. The court was previously told the young woman was subjected to a three-week ordeal of heinous violence by Harris’ flatmate, Nicholas John Crilley, in June 2017.At a Bulimba unit – which was owned by Harris – Crilley viciously assaulted the woman, burned her body with acetone and boiling water and repeatedly raped her.Crilley was jailed for life earlier this year for torturing the woman. Harris, 44, was not charged with inflicting the woman’s injuries but the Crown contends he would have known of the extent of her wounds.The former National Soccer League winner, who played for the Brisbane Strikers and Olympic Sharks, admitted to supplying Crilley with the drug Xanax during the ordeal.Texts on Harris’ phone revealed he asked Crilley if he needed supplies from the chemist to help the woman, asked a vet nurse for advice on treating injuries and complained to a friend that his house smelled of rotting flesh. On Tuesday, Crown prosecutor Sandra Cupina asked to amend Harris’ indictment to reflect the date range of his offending, which she said included dates when the unit was cleaned prior to an inspection on June 29.But Harris’ defence barrister Tony Glynn QC objected, saying his client had pleaded guilty on the basis the offences occurred within a previously agreed date range. “My learned friend shouldn’t be trying to change things on the run,” Mr Glynn told the court.“We very specifically negotiated the date range.” Ms Cupina accused Mr Glynn of lying, saying statements of facts outlining their discussions were previously sent through to the defence team.“I have written confirmation of the factual basis for the guilty plea before it was entered... he (Mr Glynn) is not even saying he might not remember,” she told the court.“I want to put on the record my objection to that allegation, it’s an outrageous statement to make,” Mr Glynn responded as the matter was stood down briefly.Judge Leanne Clare took issues with prosecution submissions through the hearing and said the sentencing was not in a position to proceed.“At this point, it’s just a piecemeal smattering of information which is far from satisfactory,” Judge Clare said.She adjourned the matter to Thursday morning. Harris’ bail was continued.

JOHNSON, Paul Lewis August 17, 148 - November 14, 2020 (Age 72) Moscow, Idaho - Paul Lewis "PJ" Johnson was born in Fargo, North Dakota on August 17, 1948 to Robert Marshall and Elaine Barbara (Olson) Johnson. During his childhood, he found a love of archery shooting. This sport became a favorite activity in which Paul and his father would compete. The whole family, including his mother, older brother, Jim and younger sister, Barbara would travel around the United States to competitions. In 1960, at age 12, Paul became the National Junior Archery Champion. Paul graduated from Fargo North High School in 1966 and enrolled in the United States Marine Corps. Paul was a member of Second Platoon, India Company, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment during most of 1968 in Vietnam. He was the Squad Leader for the machine gun teams and served on Hill 881 South at Khe Sanh. F. Phil Torres, retired Colonel of Marines described the gun teams "like a security blanket. When we heard their sound, we felt everything was going to work out okay. [Paul] was special. What he and his Marines did for us was unique. [Their] guns were the trumpets that lifted our spirits and brought us all together as one fighting unit." Paul was honorably discharged on May 1st, 1970. After his service with the United States Marine Corps, Paul moved back to Fargo, North Dakota to attend North Dakota State University where he earned an Animal Science degree. Upon completion, he moved to Pullman, Washington to begin his career at Washington State University School of Veterinary Medicine. He spent the next 30 years as the Instructional Supervisor in the Veterinary and Comparative Anatomy, Pharmacology and Physiology department, now Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience. PJ was key in establishing and managing the Worthman Anatomy Museum and provided expert oversight of the veterinary anatomy area in McCoy Hall. During this time, almost every single vet student would pass through the lab. All who were lucky enough, had the occasion to write part of their story with PJ. He was just that type of person; always willing to lend a hand and share something to take along in life. He helped generations of students become veterinarians. Paul retired in 2010. Paul also had a passion for running and horses. Throughout his career, alongside colleagues and friends he completed thousands of miles on foot while training on the Pullman streets, country roads and Martin Stadium stairs to compete in road races, marathons and a 100 mile Western States race down in southern California. He also completed several races called Ride and Tie where he ran and rode horses with a human team member and horse team member over mountainous terrains for 30 miles or more. This became another event where family would join. On these trips, it was now Paul's family traveling around the western coast of the US and Canada. Once Paul retired, he appeared determined to become a reclusive mountain man and create a place where he could live off the grid. However, beneath his put-on crusty demeanor, he stayed active running into his 60s (logging his 60,000 mile on his 60th birthday), riding horses and "hogs" (motorcycles), and working to preserve the 25 acres where he resided. MOST OF ALL, Paul continued nourishing relationships with his family and all the people he met throughout his lifethe childhood friends, the old and new Marine Corps. jarheads, the vet school students and colleagues who became friends, the running friends and any others he met along the way including the medical treatment people that became friends even at the end. Paul could be mistaken as a quiet, humble man however, he always had a story to share from a past adventure as well as a prideful narrative about his son, daughter, son-in-law or most beloved grandchildren. Paul was diagnosed with Myoepithelial Carcinoma in March 2020. His treatment plan was aggressive in an effort to delay this rare and rapidly growing cancer however, after two surgeries and chemo and radiation treatments the cancer continued to spread to his chest and lungs ultimately sending him to rest peacefully and pain free at home on November 14th, 2020. He was in the care of hospice and surrounded by his daughter's family; Sara, husband John, and three grandchildren as well as close friends who are like family - just as he wished. Paul is survived by his son, Brent Johnson; daughter, Sara Eisenbarth (Johnson), son-in law, John Eisenbarth; and three grandchildren, Jared Eisenbarth, Gavin Eisenbarth and Ella Eisenbarth; sister, Barbara Douglas (Johnson), brother in law, David Douglas; and two nieces and their families, Miel Dotson (Silbernagel) and Coco Peterson (Silbernagel). He was preceded in death by his parents and older brother James Marshall Johnson. There will be a Celebration of Life for Paul scheduled for the Spring/Summer 2021 at his residence on Moscow Mountain. Plans for this celebration are underway. Arrangements have been entrusted to Short's Funeral Chapel of Moscow and condolences may be left at www.shortsfuneralchapel.com

BERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Germany's gross domestic product grew by a record 8.5% in the third quarter as Europe's largest economy partly recovered from an unprecedented plunge caused by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring, the statistics office said on Tuesday.
 The stronger-than expected rebound was mainly driven by higher household spending and soaring exports, the office said.
 "This enabled the German economy to make up for a large part of the massive decline in gross domestic product caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the second quarter of 2020," it added.
 The reading marked an upward revision to an earlier flash estimate of 8.2% growth, and followed a 9.8% plunge in the second quarter.
 The outlook is clouded by a second wave of coronavirus infections and a partial lockdown to slow the spread of the disease. Restaurants, bars, hotels and entertainment venues have been closed since Nov. 2, but shops and schools remain open.
 Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional state premiers are planning to extend the "lockdown-light" on Wednesday until Dec. 20, according to a draft prepared for their meeting.
 A contraction in the service sector is expected to weigh heavily on gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, while lockdown measures in other countries are likely to hit export-oriented manufacturers as well.
 DIW economist Claus Michelsen said a decline in economic output was therefore on the cards, with initial estimates indicating a GDP drop of around 1% in the final quarter.
 "Germany and many important trading partners are likely to slide back into recession," Michelsen said. (Reporting by Michael Nienaber and Rene Wagner; Editing by Riham Alkousaa and EKevin Liffey)

Police said the boy was swimming with three other youths at Scarborough Beach just after 8pm on Monday when they “got into difficulties”. Three of them made it to shore with the help of a bystander, but one teenager did not make it out of the water. “We believe that the chances of survival for this long is unlikely,” Acting Inspector Cindy Morgan told reporters on Tuesday afternoon. “Search assets will remain, however they will be reduced as we move from a rescue to a recovery operation. “This is a tragic incident and we are going to support everyone involved including family, friends and witnesses.” Inspector Morgan said it was not known whether the children were hit by a wave or caught in a rip. An immediate search was launched, including drones because the conditions were good at the time, but efforts were eventually suspended at midnight. The search resumed at first light on Tuesday but had to be scaled back when visibility became poor and the conditions turned rough. Inspector Morgan could not confirm whether the youths were related, but she said the boy’s mother was in Ethiopia. “We believe that he was an inexperienced swimmer and obviously that makes it difficult to keep your head above water,” she said. Loved ones have been seen pacing the shoreline and praying. The teenager is described as tall, with dark skin, short hair and braces. He was wearing black Adidas shorts. People have been asked to avoid the area. The operation has included water police, volunteers and Surf Lifesaving personnel. WA Premier Mark McGowan said his thoughts were with the boy’s family. “It’s obviously a very, very tragic and unimaginable situation … it’s awful and shocking,” he told reporters.

 There are reasons to be hopeful: After months of waiting, two coronavirus vaccines are poised to hit the market. The companies that make both — Pfizer and Moderna — say the vaccines are safe and very effective. Pfizer, which is developing the vaccine that’s furthest along, has applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization to distribute the drug.
 The federal agency plans to review the application between now and Dec. 10 making it possible that the first vaccines could be administered in a matter of weeks. Moderna, which makes the second vaccine, is expected to make a similar request of the FDA soon.
 State officials say their goal is to get most Minnesotans vaccinated. It’s the only way, they say, vaccines can prevent further the spread of COVID-19 and prevent more people from dying.

SYDNEY, Nov 24 (Reuters) - While the words shark and Australia typically conjure up images of attacks on swimmers and surfers, 11-year-old Billie Rea didn't think twice in rescuing a shark trapped by the low tide in a rock pool and carrying it to deeper water.
 "I've got a shark. Come on darling," the girl was heard answering her mother in a video shared on social media on Tuesday, as she plucked a draughtboard shark from a tidal pool on the edge of Kingston Beach, Tasmania, about 10 km (6 miles) south of the Australian island state's capital of Hobart.
 "It's alright, it's alright," Rea cooed as she trod over mossy rocks with the brown-spotted shark in both hands before releasing it in open water.
 Rea was never in danger as the draughtboard shark is a slow-moving, bottom feeder that mostly eats small shellfish.
 "As soon as it came into view, I knew what it was and I knew that it couldn't hurt her," her mother Abby Gilbert, who filmed the rescue six days earlier, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
 "You saw in the video just how calm she is, and I feel like that animal felt so safe with her," she added.
 Abby was more concerned with the wet rocks that Billie clambered across to get to the open water than the live shark in her daughter's hands.
 "Just be careful because it's super slippery," Abby could be heard cautioning in the video just before Billie reaches the water's edge and places the shark into the sea. (Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)

 LONDON/TOKYO, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Risk-oriented currencies including the Australian dollar and the euro rose on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump accepted the start of a transition to a Biden regime, that may include former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary.
 The New Zealand dollar was among the major gainers, rising as much as 0.9% to a two-year high of $0.6985, after the country's government sought advice from the central bank on how it could help stabilize property prices, prompting investors to unwind some bets of more monetary easing.
 Trump gave the head of the General Services Administration the go-ahead to proceed with a transition to a government led by President-elect Joe Biden despite plans to continue with legal challenges.
 Democratic allies to the Biden campaign said Yellen is expected to be nominated to become Treasury Secretary, heartening investors as she has called for increased government spending to lift the economy out of a coronavirus induced recession.
 "That should be a positive appointment from the market´s point of view, as she is expected to pursue conventional policies," Commerzbank strategists said in a daily note.
 "And as far as the fiscal package is concerned, she is likely to listen to the Fed's demands and try and push a package as much as possible."
 Yellen has called for the opening of fiscal spending taps to revive an economy wrecked by the coronavirus pandemic and would be the first person to head the Treasury, the Fed and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
 In contrast, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week let some of the Fed's lending programs expire at the end of this year, opening a feud with the central bank, which said those emergency facilities are important to support the economy.
 Against a basket of other major currencies, the greenback edged 0.12% lower to 92.396, hovering just above a near three-month low of 92.013 hit on Monday.

 The dollar also struggled after AstraZeneca further lifted investors' appetite for risk by saying its COVID-19 vaccine could be about 90% effective and it would prepare to submit data to authorities around the world that have a framework for conditional or early approval.

The National Stock Exchange (NSE) has declared Karvy Stock Broking as a defaulter for non-compliance with the regulatory provisions of the bourse.
 In addition, Karvy Stock Broking has been expelled from the membership of the exchange, the NSE said in a circular.
 The move effective from November 23, was taken as the broker failed to comply with NSE guidelines, it added.
 Under the guidelines, stock brokers are required to fulfill their obligations and should not involve in any misconduct, or unprofessional conduct among others.
   
   
 Earlier, Karvy had unauthorisedly transferred securities of clients into its demat accounts by misusing the PoAs (Power of Attorney) given by its clients.
 In November 2019, the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had barred Karvy from taking new brokerage clients after it was found that the brokerage firm had allegedly misused clients' securities to the tune of more than Rs 2,000 crore. The firm misused client collateral for its own trades.
 Besides, Karvy was disabled (trading rights withdrawn) by the NSE in December 2019. PTI SP DRR DRR

 Some Japanese CEOs saw a silver lining in the onset of COVID-19 in early 2020. The pandemic's impact on revenues, profits and cash, they saw with relief, would make it hard for their troublesome activist shareholders to lodge their usual demands for higher dividends and share buybacks at the June annual general meetings and beyond.
 After 2019, a year that saw record numbers of activist campaigns, we were told that we had reached "peak activism" thanks to COVID, and that Japanese CEOs had been clairvoyant in hoarding cash in anticipation of the rainy days that the pandemic was bringing.
 And many activists did either water down or withdraw completely from many of the shareholder proposals they had planned to make at those June AGMs in deference to COVID's impact on their target companies. Events since June, however, show that the coronavirus granted Japanese CEOs only the briefest reprieve from disruptive shareholder activity.
 If anything, the months following June have brought an unprecedented flurry of shareholder activity that goes well beyond conventional shareholder activism and promises -- to Japan's advantage -- to make life for Japan's CEOs even more challenging and stressful than before.
 For one, while COVID may have kept activists temporarily at bay, on another front it has precipitated a wave of domestic merger and acquisition activity in industries under stress, starting with the retail sector.
 In the fast-food industry, Colowide acquired a controlling share of weaker rival Ootoya and promptly called an extraordinary shareholder meeting to summarily fire Ootoya management across the board. Very un-Japanese.
 Elsewhere, COVID-induced pressures in the furniture retailer market led management of the smaller Shimachu to wave the white flag to a tender offer by market leader DCM Holdings, only to have home furnishings giant Nitori Holdings join the fray with a higher bid. We are witnessing a historic contest for corporate control.
 These are major developments in a market where a full-blown hostile takeover -- a bid opposed by target management -- has so far never succeeded. All of a sudden, with a push from COVID, Japanese companies are engaging in strategic domestic M&A, not in accordance with ancient local customs, but using more or less the same playbook and rules in use in the U.S. and Europe.
 Earlier this month, on another unexpected front, domestic activist fund Strategic Capital, after suffering repeated defeats of its proposals calling for divestment of real estate assets, switched gears and announced a tender offer for 20% of Keihanshin Building. Strategic Capital's bid pushes the envelope of conventional activist practice in at least three ways.
 First, unlike strategic bids by competitors in the same industry, Strategic Capital is a purely financial bidder that saw an opportunity in the mismatch between the target's stock price and its underlying asset value. Fifteen years ago, similar bids by Steel Partners and Murakami Fund were condemned by the Japanese establishment as illegitimate and "abusive." Today, no one seems to be saying that Strategic Capital's bid should be opposed just because it seeks to make money from a valuation mismatch.
 Second, Strategic Capital's resort to a tender offer instead of the usual activist shareholder proposal is a tactic that has been missing in Japan since the demise of Steel Partners and Murakami Fund. A tender offer puts hard cash on the table for shares and is not simply a public-relations campaign to persuade other shareholders to vote their own shares.
 Finally, Strategic Capital has aggressively called attention to the conflicts of interest between the target and its primary allegiant shareholder, a megabank that owns 4% of the company and occupies five sinecure seats on the board. The time may have arrived when allegiant shareholders are as much an embarrassment as a shield against shareholder demands.
 As another example, Oasis Management, a veteran foreign activist in Japan, limited itself in June to watered-down proposals that would have no financial impact on its targets but has returned with a vengeance this month calling for a special shareholders meeting to fire the president of Tokyo Dome Corp. for failure to update the user experience on offer at the amusement complex.

Green Bay Packers wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling wants to make sure his costly fumble in an overtime loss to Indianapolis doesn't ruin the breakthrough season he's been putting together.
 The third-year pro will try to bounce back Sunday night when the NFC North- leading Packers (7-3) host the Chicago Bears (5-5).
 "Mistakes don't define you," Valdes-Scantling said Monday. "People can't define who you are. There's only one judge and that's the man up top."
 Valdes-Scantling says he received some death threats on social media Sunday after his fumble led to the Colts' game-deciding field goal in Green Bay's 34-31 loss. Valdes-Scantling had been having a productive game until that turnover.
 "Social media gives cowards the right to say whatever they want with no consequences," Valdes-Scantling said. "I guess that's one of those things, with the profession that we're in, you've got to take it for what it is, don't let it affect you. It doesn't affect me. People can say whatever they want. As long as people in this building and in my family, they all care about me, that's all that matters."

JOHNSON, Paul Lewis August 17, 148 - November 14, 2020 (Age 72) Moscow, Idaho - Paul Lewis "PJ" Johnson was born in Fargo, North Dakota on August 17, 1948 to Robert Marshall and Elaine Barbara (Olson) Johnson. During his childhood, he found a love of archery shooting. This sport became a favorite activity in which Paul and his father would compete. The whole family, including his mother, older brother, Jim and younger sister, Barbara would travel around the United States to competitions. In 1960, at age 12, Paul became the National Junior Archery Champion. Paul graduated from Fargo North High School in 1966 and enrolled in the United States Marine Corps. Paul was a member of Second Platoon, India Company, 3rd Battalion, 26th Marine Regiment during most of 1968 in Vietnam. He was the Squad Leader for the machine gun teams and served on Hill 881 South at Khe Sanh. F. Phil Torres, retired Colonel of Marines described the gun teams "like a security blanket. When we heard their sound, we felt everything was going to work out okay. [Paul] was special. What he and his Marines did for us was unique. [Their] guns were the trumpets that lifted our spirits and brought us all together as one fighting unit." Paul was honorably discharged on May 1st, 1970. After his service with the United States Marine Corps, Paul moved back to Fargo, North Dakota to attend North Dakota State University where he earned an Animal Science degree. Upon completion, he moved to Pullman, Washington to begin his career at Washington State University School of Veterinary Medicine. He spent the next 30 years as the Instructional Supervisor in the Veterinary and Comparative Anatomy, Pharmacology and Physiology department, now Integrative Physiology and Neuroscience. PJ was key in establishing and managing the Worthman Anatomy Museum and provided expert oversight of the veterinary anatomy area in McCoy Hall. During this time, almost every single vet student would pass through the lab. All who were lucky enough, had the occasion to write part of their story with PJ. He was just that type of person; always willing to lend a hand and share something to take along in life. He helped generations of students become veterinarians. Paul retired in 2010. Paul also had a passion for running and horses. Throughout his career, alongside colleagues and friends he completed thousands of miles on foot while training on the Pullman streets, country roads and Martin Stadium stairs to compete in road races, marathons and a 100 mile Western States race down in southern California. He also completed several races called Ride and Tie where he ran and rode horses with a human team member and horse team member over mountainous terrains for 30 miles or more. This became another event where family would join. On these trips, it was now Paul's family traveling around the western coast of the US and Canada. Once Paul retired, he appeared determined to become a reclusive mountain man and create a place where he could live off the grid. However, beneath his put-on crusty demeanor, he stayed active running into his 60s (logging his 60,000 mile on his 60th birthday), riding horses and "hogs" (motorcycles), and working to preserve the 25 acres where he resided. MOST OF ALL, Paul continued nourishing relationships with his family and all the people he met throughout his lifethe childhood friends, the old and new Marine Corps. jarheads, the vet school students and colleagues who became friends, the running friends and any others he met along the way including the medical treatment people that became friends even at the end. Paul could be mistaken as a quiet, humble man however, he always had a story to share from a past adventure as well as a prideful narrative about his son, daughter, son-in-law or most beloved grandchildren. Paul was diagnosed with Myoepithelial Carcinoma in March 2020. His treatment plan was aggressive in an effort to delay this rare and rapidly growing cancer however, after two surgeries and chemo and radiation treatments the cancer continued to spread to his chest and lungs ultimately sending him to rest peacefully and pain free at home on November 14th, 2020. He was in the care of hospice and surrounded by his daughter's family; Sara, husband John, and three grandchildren as well as close friends who are like family - just as he wished. Paul is survived by his son, Brent Johnson; daughter, Sara Eisenbarth (Johnson), son-in law, John Eisenbarth; and three grandchildren, Jared Eisenbarth, Gavin Eisenbarth and Ella Eisenbarth; sister, Barbara Douglas (Johnson), brother in law, David Douglas; and two nieces and their families, Miel Dotson (Silbernagel) and Coco Peterson (Silbernagel). He was preceded in death by his parents and older brother James Marshall Johnson. There will be a Celebration of Life for Paul scheduled for the Spring/Summer 2021 at his residence on Moscow Mountain. Plans for this celebration are underway. Arrangements have been entrusted to Short's Funeral Chapel of Moscow and condolences may be left at www.shortsfuneralchapel.com

Layers of complexity
 Among the logistical challenges of distributing the two vaccines in the pipeline — and particularly the Pfizer vaccine — is that they are fragile and require special handling.
 The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius — an unusually cold temperature for a vaccine, Swift said. The Moderna vaccine requires cold storage, too, but not as frigid.
 And while Mayo has the ability to store both vaccines safely, Swift said, other challenges remain: Both vaccines require that a patient is administered two doses, weeks apart. Both doses need to be of the same vaccine — either the Pfizer one or the Moderna.
 “The vaccines are not interchangeable. If you get vaccine A for dose one, you need vaccine A for dose two, as well,” she said. “That’s an additional layer of complexity that we haven’t seen in other vaccine products.”
 Swift said Mayo is designing systems to make sure the correct second dose is provided at exactly the right time for it to be most effective.

 # Chillicothe man arrested in aggravated robbery
 Justin Reutter
 Chillicothe Gazette
 CHILLICOTHE - A Chillicothe man was arrested following an alleged robbery Sunday afternoon in an incident at Dunham's Sporting Goods, according to Chillicothe Police.
 Jonathan F. Berry, 23, of 988 Church St., was charged with aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, after allegedly running out of the store with a bag of merchandise after threatening employees with a box cutter, according to a police report obtained by the Gazette.
 The incident began at 4:40 p.m. Sunday, when an employee noticed a man, later identified as Noah Richards, 18, of Chillicothe, allegedly putting items into a duffle bag and told him to leave.
 The employee stated that once she told Richards to leave she then approached Berry and told him that she already told his friend to leave.
 Berry then proceeded to walk towards the exit. The employee stated that Berry then ran out the front door, picking up the bag on the way out.
 The store manager was outside at the time with another man while she was taking her break when Berry ran outside and the manager saw him run behind the loading dock area. The pair pulled up by the loading dock and told Berry to leave the merchandise there, according to the CPD report..
 At that point, Berry allegedly came around a dumpster with a box cutter in hand and started walking towards the pair. The man drew a handgun and told Berry to drop the box cutter. All three waited for police to arrive.
 The duffel bag in question contained a speaker, clothes and BB gun for a total of $290.94, including the duffel bag itself, the report stated.
 The box cutter was also collected for evidence. Berry told responding officers that the only reason he took the bag is that he thought it belonged to his friend, Noah Richards, who he said told him to grab the bag.
 Berry also said that he was hungry and Richards told him that if he grabbed the bag, Richards would give him food. Berry said he didn't mean to pull the box cutter out of his pocket but that it opened up and he was trying to close it, according to the report.
 Richards also was still in the parking lot at the time that police arrived, and was issued a citation for complicity to theft and given a court date for 9 a.m. Dec 4.
 Richards told police that he was there with his girlfriend shopping and planned on paying for the items that he was putting in the bag. When asked where his girlfriend was, he said that she went home.

The news has garnered a mixed reaction with local people however with some believing the funds could have been allocated to local people who have lost their jobs and businesses.
 Some small music venues in Blackpool who have been unable to qualify for government funding or theatres that are struggling for survival during the pandemic have been at the heart of the concern.
 People have taken to Facebook to raise concerns that the money could have been used elsewhere.
 Lauren Holt said: "I love history and the history of my home town. I’m all about keeping it nice and looked after but when we are in a situation like this and people who have worked hard for years are losing their small businesses, jobs, homes; not knowing where the next meal for their children is coming from; people committing suicide then I do not agree with all that money going on a paint job.
 "I don't think the time is right to broadcast that that money is going on a ceiling. Just think of how many local families that money could help - the homeless, small businesses, the recently unemployed and more."
 "Look at all the homeless people when you go to town. Look at all the people who are struggling to keep their heating on. I understand those kind of big jobs take a lot of money however it's just a kick in the teeth for local people in Blackpool who are losing everything."
 However Blackpool Council has moved to allay concerns, saying that the grant is separate from funding given to venues to survive closure and is specifically for the restoration of important heritage sites.

When it comes to threats of violence, particularly gun violence, public schools typically have a zero-tolerance policy. That policy can, admittedly, be somewhat extreme, such as when an elementary school student has in his book bag a tiny solid plastic handgun dispensed by a toy vending machine. But generally speaking, these policies are warranted in light of the school shootings this nation has witnessed.
 These policies have led to students being suspended for cause, and while the students have not been named school districts have typically addressed the matter head-on in an effort to be transparent. They know that word will get out quickly when and if a student is caught with a handgun or even a long gun accidentally brought on campus during hunting season.
 And so, to mitigate circumstances, to avoid being accused of hiding information important for students, parents and teachers alike to be aware of, school administrations send out press releases and parent notifications to let the public know what occurred and how the matter was handled.
 That is as it should be. That level of transparency, however, should extend beyond cases involving students. If a teacher is leveling similar threats, certainly a district should react quickly to investigate and, if warranted, terminate the employee. But it should also take the extra steps of ensuring parents, students and other school staff are aware of the circumstances and how the matter was handled.
 Greenwood County School District 50 failed in this case.
 A Pinecrest Elementary School teacher told fellow teachers in September of last year that there would be another school shooting. Only, in this case she said she would be the shooter. Apparently her frustration with a student at the beginning of the 2019-20 school year led to her saying this on two occasions, once to clarify that she indeed meant she would be the shooter.
 The district was right to investigate the allegations and, apparently, the teacher was terminated. But it was not until the state Board of Education issued a public reprimand that this news came to light. And that’s where the school district failed parents, students and other staff.
 Following its internal investigation, District 50 should have made public the allegations, the findings and the punishment meted out. While the district did not necessarily have to identify the teacher, it most certainly should have quelled any rumors and assured the public it was not hiding information by being forthcoming.
 Threats such as this are always alarming and should be handled swiftly and forthrightly. There should not be a different set of rules for teachers who threaten to shoot students than there are for students who level threats of carrying out a school shooting.
 Transparency in September of 2019 would have gone a long way toward assuring the public that the district’s zero-tolerance policy is applicable across the board.

Iozzi and the Jets huddled up to create a game plan that would benefit those participating as clients, such as Guzman-Torres, and those serving as mentors.
 "They came at it with the right approach," Iozzi said of the Jets. "They didn't want a fluff program. They wanted to do something that was meaningful."
 The program included the Jets employees using Zoom breakout rooms to review and improve the clients' resumes and cover letters, as well as holding mock interviews and offering tips for their LinkedIn accounts and suggestions about searching for employment opportunities.
 "They were amazing," Guzman-Torres said. "They really took the time."
 Sandy Osipowitz, the Jets' senior director of corporate partnership activation, felt she was relatable to a lot of them as a mother of three who has been managing her work-from-home life while also balancing the responsibilities of parenthood.
 "We wanted to share our experiences and do everything we can to help them," Osipowitz said. "They're out of work and looking for some guidance and some additional help with getting their resumes or interview skills to a certain place to help them feel confident."
 Dress For Success was founded by Nancy Lublin in 1997 and has expanded to almost 150 cities in 25 countries. Iozzi's affiliate, with a staff of three and several volunteers, serves 10 counties in northern New Jersey and has helped nearly 1,000 women since the pandemic began.
 "To have a stranger do something so nice for you and reach out and really want to make that connection because they can and because they care, it's really overwhelming, I think, for our clients to come to terms with the fact there are people out there like that," Iozzi said. "It's very humbling."
 While many of Dress For Success' clients come from low-income brackets, several are women over 50 who had 20 or more years of professional experience and whose companies downsized and didn't rehire. Others are simply looking to further their careers.
 "Basically, if you're a woman who needs to be suited with confidence, we're the go-to," Iozzi said. "You might be underemployed, unemployed, you may be newly employed and still just trying to figure out, OK, what does that mean now? How do I budget? How can I get my family to be in a better position? So we work with a woman continually through that journey."
 The Jets hope to be there along the way, too, to continue to encourage and assist women through similar collaborations.
 "It just helps the community and it really helps our employees overall in their career development and while they're home, it helps them in their personal development," Mandler said. "I mean, it just hit so many things for us internally and organizationally that it just felt so good all around."

Officials with Northern College are applauding an announced increase in provincial funding being directed towards critical maintenance, repairs, upgrades and renewals at Ontario unversities and colleges over the next three years.
 The government has committed to investing of $466 million in capital grants.
 "For Northern colleges, investments like this allow us to update and adapt infrastructure for an everchanging educational landscape," said Audrey Penner, president and chief executive officer Northern College.
 In addition to the $144-million investment in Facilities Renewal Program (FRP) funding for 2020-21, the Ontario government is investing $20 million through the College Equipment and Renewal Fund (CERF) to help Ontario colleges purchase and renew instructional equipment and learning resources.
 This funding is also being used to purchase equipment to support student virtual learning during COVID-19. It amounts to a total investment of $164 million in capital funding in 2020-21 to help colleges and universities ensure that their students, faculty and staff have modern and safe learning environments.
 "Infrastructure challenges have existed within the sector for a while; in the face of a global pandemic, we find ourselves forced to accelerate infrastructure upgrades, particularly in ventilation systems. The CERF funding announcement is crucial to our goal of providing the latest in technology- focused  experiential learning for our students via new and enhanced delivery methods that have become so essential during these challenging times," added Penner.
 The announcement made late last week in Sault Ste. Marie by Ross Romano, Ontario Minister of Colleges and Universities, outlines a $144-million investment for 2020-21, matching that same investment for 2021-22, with an increase to $178 million for 2022-23.
 This initial investment represents a $73-million increase over investments made last year.
 "The first-class education students receive at our postsecondary institutions is critical to the future of Ontario, our economy, and the prosperity of our people," said Minister Romano. "That is why our government is committed to providing annual funding that will help our colleges and universities renew and modernize their facilities."
 These new grants are outlined in the 2020 Ontario Budget Ontario's Action Plan: Protect, Support, Recover and are aimed at allowing the provinces post- secondary institutions to address a backlog of maintenance projects, critical repairs, classroom modernization, technological upgrades and improvements to environmental sustainability.
 "Ontario universities welcome this funding for university infrastructure. This support helps our institutions continue to provide modern learning environments for students, operate more efficiently and renew our facilities," said Steve Orsini, Council of Ontario Universities president and CEO.
 "It will also help address the growing capital needs of our institutions, generate local employment opportunities and drive growth in communities across Ontario."

William M.      “Bill” McFarlane      Jan. 21, 1940 - Nov. 22, 2020      SOUTH BEND, IN -      William “Bill” McFarlane, 80, passed away early on the morning of November 22, 2020. He was born to the late Peter Edward McFarlane and Frances Hester on January 21, 1940 in South Bend and remained a lifelong resident. In addition to his parents, Bill was preceded in death by his siblings, Barbara Madison and Frances McFarlane; as well as brothers, Ronald and Robert McFarlane.      Bill was a sweet, earnest man who accomplished the rare feat of moving through the world with total kindness, leaving everyone he met with a warm feeling and a smile. He worked for many years at the South Bend Tribune as a district manager overseeing the newspaper carriers, and then as a delivery driver for DHL, formerly Airborne Express. He was a proud member of Teamsters local 364 and enjoyed his work for the opportunity it afforded to meet new and interesting people every day.      Bill's sunny outlook on life often led him to declare each new day the “bluest sky” he'd ever seen or a meal the “best he'd ever had”, and everyone was his “best friend.” He was overjoyed by the simplest gift for the thought behind it. He loved watching Sammy, Tiger, Walter, and Michael. More than anything, he loved his Cubs. From the day he retired, Bill never missed a Cubs game on TV, from the era of VHS through DVR. His lifelong dream as a diehard Cubs fan was fulfilled when in 2016 he was able to see the Cubs finally win the World Series.      Bill was a loving husband, father, stepfather, and grandfather, always the first to cheerfully greet family in the door on holidays and Sunday visits. He was genuinely amazed at watching his children and grandchildren grow and flourish over the years. His warm smile and often silly words will be dearly missed.      Bill is survived by his devoted wife Carol, his brother, Jim (Bev) McFarlane of Oregon; his children, Marlo (Matt) Hofmann of Indianapolis and Edward McFarlane of South Bend; and stepchildren, Megan (Austin) Sheraton of South Bend, Heather (David) Frye of Florida, Joseph (Kathy) Blank of North Carolina, and Matthew (Heather) Blank of Florida. He is also survived by his 20 grandchildren: Justin and Ethan Hofmann; Jordon, Jeremy, and Tiffany Landry; Kaitlyn, David (Suzie), Cameron (Kacey), Alyssa, Dillon, and Dalton Blank; Sam, Max (Katie), Anna, and Ben Ujdak; Leo and Chase Sheraton; and Tim, Ellie, and Natalie Frye. Bill is also survived by his beloved dog “Oscar,” whom the rest of the family know as Oliver.      The family would like to offer their most sincere gratitude to the caregivers at Heart to Heart Hospice of Mishawaka for their exceptional care. Their kindness and compassion helped Bill and Carol during a very difficult time more than words can express. The family would also like to thank the staff at Morningview Assisted Living Facility for taking such good care of Bill over the past few months.            There will be a visitation from 3-7 pm on Friday, November 27 at Kaniewski Funeral Home, 3545 N. Bendix Dr., South Bend. A private Funeral service for family will take place on Saturday, November 28. In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Bill's memory to Heart to Heart Hospice.

This is certainly not true. No weight loss pills are addictive. That is not case, whether we are talking over the counter ones or those that require a prescription and are approved by the FDA. One of them is even applied under the skin, but there are certainly no signs of any addiction. None of the ingredients are known to be addictive. Only mental addiction can potentially occur in the form that obese people think that their weight will return if they stop taking the pill. But it certainly has nothing to do with the ingredients themselves but rather with mental problems caused by obesity.

Self-care isn’t a new fad. The difference is that pre-pandemic, it could fall by the wayside if a to-do list got crowded. Now, eight months into the new reality, it is a priority. After all, the thinking goes: If we’re not taking care of ourselves, how can we do jobs, parent children, care for loved ones?

As part of its COVID-19 safety plan, Walla Walla University has announced that it will withdraw from the Cascade Collegiate Conference (CCC) schedules for men’s and women’s basketball, women’s volleyball, and men’s soccer for the 2020-2021 academic year.
 The decision follows careful review by the university’s COVID-19 Response Task Force and Athletics Department, and significant consultation with WWU President John McVay and CCC Commissioner Rob Cashell. WWU athletes were informed of the decision over the weekend, just prior to the conclusion of the university’s fall academic quarter.
 “Our primary concern is for the safety and well-being of Walla Walla University students, faculty and staff,” said McVay. “I am disappointed that we are unable to participate in these athletic seasons, as well as so many other cherished WWU activities and traditions. This pandemic is challenging, and we are doing our best to enable our students to continue their academic programs in a safe and supportive environment. While I am disappointed now, I know I join countless others in looking forward to a time when normal activities can resume.”
 “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect each institution and community differently, and we certainly respect the decision by Walla Walla University to opt out of CCC men's and women's basketball, volleyball and men's soccer for the 2020-2021 season,” stated CCC Commissioner Robert Cashell. “None of these choices come easy, but as a conference we fully support the need for campus leadership to do what they feel is best as we all continue to navigate the situation.”
 The women’s volleyball and men’s soccer seasons were already delayed from normal fall competition, and university officials were monitoring closely to determine what might be possible for winter sports like basketball. These teams have not practiced for the last two weeks due to concerns over the number of COVID-19 cases in Walla Walla County, and restrictions seemed likely to continue.
 The university’s decision to withdraw from the CCC volleyball, soccer, and basketball schedules is part of a larger effort to solidify plans for academics and student life so that students could be adequately prepared for winter quarter.
 “It is increasingly clear to us that aggressive COVID-19 safety measures will still be needed during winter quarter,” says Doug Tilstra, WWU vice president for Student Life. “After reviewing guidance from health and safety experts, noting where we are with local infection spread and anticipating a need for university safety measures well into winter quarter, we felt it was right to make this decision now. We wanted to alert our student-athletes so they would know how to plan.”
 Currently, WWU plans to participate in the CCC’s cross-country and golf schedules for this academic year and will begin looking ahead to 2021-2022 seasons for Wolves Athletics. Members of the teams affected by the withdrawal may remain enrolled in classes and will continue to receive support from the university’s Athletics Department.
 “The Wolves Athletic Department has worked closely with our COVID-19 Response Task Force on a safe restart plan for our program. Throughout the summer and fall quarter, we strove to provide safe means for our student-athletes to train, practice, and play,” says Interim Athletic Director Paul Starkebaum. “I want to thank the task force for their efforts to evaluate and improve our plans over the last five months.”
 “It was disappointing to withdraw from CCC schedules this year,” Starkebaum adds. “Our student-athletes, coaches and athletic staff put in a great effort to adapt to state, county and campus guidelines to serve our teams and keep our campus safe. We will continue to work towards a safe restart of our athletic program.”
