WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened social media companies with new regulation or even shuttering a day after Twitter added fact checks to two of his tweets.The president can't unilaterally regulate or close the companies, which would require action by Congress or the Federal Communications Commission. But that didn't stop Trump from angrily issuing a strong warning.Claiming tech giants "silence conservative voices," Trump tweeted, "We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen." And he repeated his unsubstantiated claim — which sparked his latest showdown with Silicon Valley — that expanding mail-in voting "would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots.....happen again. Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating, forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise, Social Media. Clean up your act, NOW!!!!&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2020

Trump and his campaign angrily lashed out Tuesday after Twitter added a warning phrase to two Trump tweets that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted that “mail boxes will be robbed,” among other things. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.Trump replied on Twitter, accusing the platform of "interfering in the 2020 Presidential Election" and insisting that "as president, I will not allow this to happen." His 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale, said Twitter's "clear political bias" had led the campaign to pull "all our advertising from Twitter months ago." Twitter has banned all political advertising since last November.Trump did not explain his threat Wednesday, and the call to expand regulation appeared to fly in the face of long-held conservative principles on deregulation.But some Trump allies, who have alleged bias on the part of tech companies, have questioned whether platforms like Twitter and Facebook should continue to enjoy liability protections as "platforms" under federal law — or be treated more like publishers, which could face lawsuits over content.The protections have been credited with allowing the unfettered growth of the internet for more than two decades, but now some Trump allies are advocating that social media companies face more scrutiny.“Big tech gets a huge handout from the federal government,” Republican Sen. Josh Hawley told Fox News. “They get this special immunity, this special immunity from suits and from liability that’s worth billions of dollars to them every year. Why are they getting subsidized by federal taxpayers to censor conservatives, to censor people critical of China.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.",

Premier League clubs voted unanimously on Wednesday to resume contact training as the English top-flight took a significant step towards a possible restart in June.
 The Premier League was put on hold in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, with Liverpool agonisingly close to the title.
 Clubs returned to training in small and socially distanced groups last week but they have now moved to stage two of the "return to training protocol".
 "Premier League shareholders today voted unanimously to resume contact training, marking another step towards restarting the Premier League season, when safe to do so," the league said in a statement.
 "Squads are now able to train as a group and engage in tackling while minimising any unnecessary close contact."
 It added: "Discussions are ongoing as work continues towards resuming the season, when conditions allow."
 The small number of positive tests from the first two rounds of testing at Premier League clubs has raised hopes of a return next month.
 Eight cases of coronavirus among players and staff have been detected from 1,744 tests in the Premier League.
 In the second-tier Championship, just two positive tests were registered from 1,014 tests.
 A targeted return date of June 12 was described by Premier League chief executive Richard Masters last week as a "staging post".
 Players and coaches have argued they will need until at least the end of June to reduce the risk of injuries after such a long lay-off.
 Some players have voiced fears over their safety and that of their families due to the virus.
 Watford captain Troy Deeney has not returned to training after three positive cases were registered by the Hornets over concerns he could spread the virus to his five-month-old son.
 French World Cup winner N'Golo Kante has also been given permission by Chelsea to train at home.
 Germany's Bundesliga has already managed to complete two rounds of fixtures since returning behind closed doors and there has been little player opposition to La Liga's plans to return in Spain from June 11.
 Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson said playing at an empty Anfield and winning the Premier League title with no fans present would be "pretty strange".
 Liverpool were 25 points clear of 2019 champions Manchester City when the league was shut down, on the verge of being crowned English champions for the first time in 30 years.
 "Of course it would feel different because if you win any trophy and receive it without any fans there, it would be pretty strange," he told the BBC.
 "We still have work to do and we still need to perform at a high level right the way until the season finishes because we want to finish as strongly as we can to make sure it is a full season," he added.

“At a time when consumers are especially inclined in certain verticals and when cost efficiencies are vital but also achievable—affiliate marketing has been especially active.  _Paying for outcomes_  has never been a more powerful proposition than it is right now. Leverage is essential,” states Maura Smith, CMO at Pepperjam. “You see, with  _CPCs and CPMs on the rise_ , marketers need ‘operating leverage’ to essentially subsidize their presence in high cost channels. As tried and true to experienced marketers, affiliate marketing has certainly  _proved itself before_. So, during the pandemic, it absolutely is a go-to solution. We’ve been watching the trends over the past two months very closely. We take a pulse weekly.”

A woman in Georgia was left shell shocked when a turtle went flying across the highway and through her windshield, nearly striking her passenger in the face.
 Latonya Lark was driving along Harry S. Truman Parkway in Savannah with her brother, Kevin Grant, on May 19 to run a few errands. In a split second, the pair found themselves face to face with an unlucky turtle.
 "I saw out of the corner of my eye what I thought was a brick," Lark told CNN. "I told my brother, 'Oh my God there's a brick flying across the highway.' No sooner than I said that, it impacted my vehicle. It scared me so bad, it sounded like a bomb went off and glass went all over my brother."
 If she hadn't slowed down when she did, the turtle may have gone entirely through the windshield and hit her brother in the face, "probably decapitating him," the small business owner said.
