What do COVID deniers and protesters of police brutality have in common?
   
 The first group tends to be older, whiter, and more conservative. The more militant ones confront those wearing masks in public, but most simply choose not to wear masks themselves, despite the clear evidence that these slow the pandemic's growth. They also crowd together in public spaces -- in some cases a deliberate snub to public-health authorities. What preventative steps they do take appear completely ineffective, like stocking up on guns and ammunition.
   
 The second group has also been crowding together in public spaces lately, though many wear masks. Memorials honoring police brutality victim George Floyd have turned into raucous, nationwide protests that sometimes spill over into rioting. These have raged for days in Kansas City. Smaller actions are occurring in other area communities, including Lawrence and Topeka. President Trump and others respond with a call for "law and order," inviting comparisons to President Nixon's election in 1968.
   
 Beneath their hatred for one another, these two groups share something. Both gave up on traditional, political actions like voting, town hall meetings and volunteering. The see a government that often runs on autopilot, with little regard for voters or elected officials.
   
 Twentieth-century political philosophers called this "The Administrative State" -- a government where professional administrators just go on doing what they do, regardless of who votes, how they vote or who holds office.
   
 There is no oversight or accountability. Philosopher Hannah Arendt called this "government by nobody."
   
 Consider the shutdowns of schools, many workplaces and public spaces in response to COVID-19. It occurred quickly, with little public input. Epidemiologists and other public health officials advised Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and others to quarantine, and it happened.
   
 This was probably necessary, given the incredible speed with which the novel coronavirus spread. However, it also left many citizens feeling that nothing they did really mattered -- government was going to do what government does, regardless.
   
 Former President Obama once said that working-class whites "cling to their guns and religion" when they feel threatened. Obama faced strong blowback for this, but it is exactly what happened. Faced with government administrators who ignored them, this population not only stocked up on firearms, they also made the reopening of churches a centerpiece of their demands.
   
 Next come the protesters outraged by Floyd's death and other police brutalities. They think the Administrative State is ignoring them. They are right. Floyd's murder occurred in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The mayor of Minneapolis, that district's U.S. representative, and the governor of Minnesota are all strong progressives who support policing reforms. What difference did this make for Floyd? None.
   
 As in other cities, the police behave as "street level bureaucrats" with little regard for oversight by elected officials. In Minneapolis, a history of racial segregation and strong police unions reinforce these tendencies. Activists have faced similar frustrations in their recent efforts to reform policing here, in Kansas City, Kansas.
   
 Like other bureaucrats, police simply wait out their supposed supervisors in the mayor's office, city council and other elected bodies. Politicians come and go, but the police are still here, doing what they do. Critics are left feeling impotent and outraged. They turn to protesting and even rioting instead of voting. Been there, done that, nothing changed.
   
 Ultimately, in order for us to restore a functioning government, Government by Nobody has got to go. It will be messy, but the sooner we get started, the better.

LONDON (AP) — Attorneys representing Britain’s Prince Andrew say they’ve been assured by the U.S. Department of Justice that he is not a target in the investigation of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The firm, Blackfords LLP, said U.S. authorities requested the help of the son of Queen Elizabeth II for the first time in January after having investigated Epstein for 16 years. He has offered three times to do so — contrary to the statements of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, the firm said."Importantly, the DOJ advised us that the Duke is not and has never been a 'target' of their criminal investigations into Epstein and that they sought his confidential, voluntary co-operation,'' the attorneys said.The firm issued the unusual statement after reports in Britain's Sun newspaper and on NBC that American authorities had formally requested that Andrew answer questions on the matter. He categorically denies wrongdoing and has repeatedly insisted that he was willing to cooperate with U.S. authorities.Berman has instead said that Andrew has provided "zero cooperation" to the American investigators who want to interview him as part of their sex trafficking probe.The contrasting views of what is going on behind the scenes came after The Sun newspaper reported that the DOJ submitted a mutual legal assistance request to Britain's Home Office. Such requests are used in criminal cases under a treaty and are generally used when material can't be obtained on a police cooperation basis. As Blackfords insists Andrew is trying to cooperate, it pushed back Monday. It said it was a "matter of regret'' that the department would "breach its own rules of confidentiality, not least as they are designed to encourage witness cooperation. "Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen,'' Blackfords said. "Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DOJ have given the global media – and, therefore, the worldwide audience – an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them.Andrew has flatly denied he had sex with a teenager who says she was trafficked by Epstein. The woman, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has said Epstein forced her to have sex with Andrew in 2001, when she was 17. She said Epstein flew her around the world on private planes to have sex with powerful men, and that she had sexual encounters with Andrew in London, New York and in the U.S. Virgin Islands.Epstein killed himself in a U.S. jail last summer as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Stores can only have eight people - staff included - per 1,000 square feet, or 40 percent capacity.
 “I don’t mind going out and about and doing some stuff just as long as it’s not like wicked crazy,” said Lynda McIntosh of Chicopee.
 With more people willing to venture out, even essential businesses are getting crowded.
 “Over at Walmart, you’ve got to stand in-line and I ain’t standing in no line,” McIntosh said.
 McIntosh said she is now able to get some of the items on her list from different stores.
 “It’s nice to know that at least some of them are opening for now,” McIntosh noted.
 Certain personal service businesses like makeup and nail salons, gyms, and massage therapists are still closed.
 Shoppers said they understand the risks and hope people follow social distancing guidelines.
 “I’ll be wearing my mask for sure, even when these places open,” Guzman said.
 McIntosh added, “It just feels good to get out, it really does.”
 Some businesses with the latitude to open today are still holding off until later this week.

  The COVID-19 pandemic has hurt small businesses owned by people of color, immigrants, and women more than other groups, according to new research.

  Between February and April, the number of active business owners in the country fell by 22%, from 15 million to 11.7 million, the National Bureau of Economic Research study found. The comparable number during the Great Recession was 5%, or 730,000 business owners, the report notes.


  "The drop in business owners was the largest on record, and losses were felt across nearly all industries and even for incorporated businesses," wrote report author Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz.


  During this period of the COVID-19 pandemic, the hardest hit small business owners were:
