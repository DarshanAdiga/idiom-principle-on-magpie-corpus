This series is a drama that is based on the life of Jesus Christ and is created, directed, and co-written by American filmmaker Dallas Jenkins. It was also the first multi-season series about the life of Christ, and season one was the highest crowd-funded TV series or film project of all time. While the actual release date of season two is yet to be announced, filming has already begun and fans can watch behind the scenes videos and sneak peeks on Youtube. Groves said, "I absolutely intend to watch season 2 of _The Chosen_.

Allegations that other false financial documents relating to a former employee of the earl were produced were examined by an internal BBC investigation in the 1996, as it tried to determine whether or not the princess had been misled – with a key piece of evidence, a note, suggesting she had not.
 Mr Bashir, now the BBC’s religion editor, is seriously ill with Covid-related complications and is not in a position to respond to the earl’s allegations, the BBC has said.
 Mr Purvis said: “The original allegation about the bank statement affecting a member of (Earl) Spencer’s … staff is dwarfed in significance by these new allegations.
 “And I can’t believe the BBC would not, certainly the new director-general of the BBC, would not want to get to the bottom of that one way or the other, and discover if that’s true.
 “And if (Earl) Spencer has waited 25 years to make this allegation then I think the BBC is perfectly entitled to say ‘Really, you should have mentioned this before’. If, on the other hand, they did not make their inquiry robust enough to allow him to make that allegation, then I think that does reflect poorly on the BBC’s ability to investigate itself.”
 In a series of tweets posted earlier this week, Earl Spencer said the corporation was “incapable of honestly facing up to the ugly truth of this matter”.

However, the Queen has since given the relationship her blessing. During their wedding in 2005, while neither she nor Prince Philip attended the civil ceremony, they attended the reception, where the Queen toasted: “They have come through and I’m very proud and wish them well.

Bloomberg) -- A blank-check company backed by former Citigroup Inc. rainmaker Michael Klein is among the parties interested in buying a stake in AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV satellite-television business, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
 Churchill Capital Corp. IV, which raised $2.07 billion in July, is working with advisers on a potential bid for the asset, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
 AT&T has been seeking investors to buy a significant stake in the business, allowing the telecom and media giant to remove DirecTV from its books while maintaining access to some of its cash flow.
 Private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc. is also continuing discussions with AT&T, which is looking to announce a transaction before the end of the year, the people said.
 DirecTV is expected to be valued at about $15 billion in a deal, the people said. That is a fraction of the $48.5 billion AT&T agreed to pay for it in 2014. The price tag including debt then was $67.1 billion.
 No final decision has been made and AT&T could opt to not proceed with any potential transaction, the people said.
 Representatives for AT&T, Apollo and Klein declined to comment.
 Klein, Churchill Capital’s chief executive officer, has been one of the busiest SPAC dealmakers, with three of his blank-check companies announcing mergers in the past two years. Last month, the educational technology companies Global Knowledge Training LLC and Skillsoft Ltd. agreed to merge with and go public through his Churchill Capital Corp. II.
 He has previously shown an interest in media assets and considered buying Univision Communications Inc. this year. Instead, former Viacom Inc. Chief Financial Officer Wade Davis agreed in February to buy a majority stake in the Spanish-language broadcaster.
 After years of growing through acquisitions, AT&T is culling assets under new CEO John Stankey as it faces pressure from activist investor Elliott Management Corp.

If the coronavirus crisis was the making of Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, the most popular member of the British government is trying to make sure it doesn't end up being his undoing.The UK's finance minister made a dramatic intervention in the economy again on Thursday by extending a furlough program until March, ripping up his plans of just a few days earlier. While the nation may be desperate for aid as England went into another lockdown, the U-turn also follows a series of missteps.Sunak had a meteoric rise when he was thrust into the Treasury's top job in February just weeks before a budget. He swiftly rolled out a package to shore up companies and jobs, saying he would do "whatever it takes" to protect the economy. It even drew plaudits from political adversaries such as Len McCluskey, the socialist leader of the biggest union.In recent weeks, though, his promise exposed its limitations as the pandemic got out of control. Northern regions hit hardest by the virus, the Scottish government and the opposition Labour Party rounded on him with job losses increasing. Some within the governing Conservatives questioned Sunak's apparent desire to control spending in a crisis.The Treasury refused to fund extra support for businesses in Manchester and to pay for free school meals for poorer kids over the autumn mid-term break. That stood out all the more after Sunak subsidized dining out in August to help the hospitality industry, a program some studies say may have hastened the spread of the virus.Then as infections started to outstrip even the worst- case projections of government scientists, Sunak announced major changes to job support five times in six weeks."The chancellor has been one step behind events throughout this crisis, which has left many people without support," said Lydia Prieg, head of economics at the New Economics Foundation. "Sunak's fixation on urgently winding down support for jobs and incomes was deeply misguided."Britain has endured a particularly torrid year as the country recorded the highest death toll in Europe from Covid-19 and measures to restrain infections appeared behind the curve. Yet Sunak burnished his reputation as an ally of business and steady force in a party getting increasingly agitated with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership.The Treasury has said it's always kept measures under review and Sunak on Thursday explained to the House of Commons why he'd shifted tack several times in recent weeks, acknowledging it opened him up to critics. "To anyone in the real world that is just the thing you have to do when the circumstances change," he said.But critics say Sunak, 40, hastened job losses by setting deadlines for support. That's partly a function of treating the virus like a time-limited economic crisis rather than a rolling health disaster.On Saturday, he extended the furlough program for an extra month, just hours before it was due to end, before adding another four months on Thursday.For someone many Tory MPs consider their potential next leader, some of the shine has now come off the chancellor. One minister, who declined to be named when commenting on Sunak's performance, said he's gone from "deity to demi-god." "Rishi has been dragged slowly to several things he should have done sooner and has not reconciled his fiscal conservatism with the times we're living in," the person said.Sunak still remains the highest ranked cabinet minister in the ConservativeHome website's monthly poll of Tories, with a positive rating of 81.1 per cent on Nov. 2, albeit down from a high of 94.8 per cent on April 3. Mel Stride, the Tory chairman of the House of Commons Treasury Committee, said the chancellor overall has "done pretty well" in tough times.But Stride also wants Sunak to broaden the scope of his effort to get the country through the pandemic. In the spring, the Treasury Committee urged the chancellor to devise plans to help hundreds of thousands of self-employed workers who fell between the cracks of his assistance programs. But he doesn't look like ever doing so."To have a million plus people who haven't received support and are still not going to receive support going forward, I think is deeply problematic," said Stride.Labour has tried to capitalize on Sunak's approach. Finance spokeswoman Anneliese Dodds slammed his "last-minute scramble" to repeatedly update support levels while leader Keir Starmer sought to blame Sunak for hindering efforts to go into lockdown earlier.Polling this week by both YouGov and Savanta ComRes showed Sunak's approval ratings among voters at their lowest since the outbreak began. That initial popularity was largely down to the program he started in March paying 80 per cent of the wages of furloughed employees, according to Chris Hopkins, political research director at Savanta ComRes.Sunak's prior insistence on replacing furlough with a less generous plan, with a focus on supporting "viable" jobs, drew the ire of people working in shuttered industries such as events and the theater."What gave him such a boost was the fact that he was being so generous," Hopkins said before the program was extended. "Some of that support has naturally ebbed away."Sunak has now sought to address that by paying workers for far longer than the planned month of lockdown is due to last. His largess still ran into criticism in a week when Lloyds Banking Group Plc and retailers John Lewis Partnership and J Sainsbury Plc became the latest companies to announce job cuts.Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, slammed the move on Twitter, saying Sunak appeared to have learnt nothing since March. He said the chancellor is not targeting the aid and thus wasting money."The government's initially decisive approach is now in danger of looking more reactive than proactive," said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, which represent 75,000 companies. "Too often business communities are left to speculate what the latest in a string of announcements on financial support will bring."

 This weekend’s round of fixtures are the last before another international break and Wilder has once more expressed his concern with Covid-19 cases on the rise.
 The Blades boss hopes to avoid another “close call” after it looked like John Egan might have the virus when he returned from duty with Republic of Ireland during the October international break.
 Wilder, who last month called for international football to be curtailed amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis, said: “The schedule is not ideal.
 “I’m caught in between as I’ve always been a massive supporter of players going away and representing their countries and getting games playing in different styles and against top players. But their is obviously a big concern.
 “We had a massive scare with John Egan last time, that was touch and go as to whether he would be made available after coming back from the last international break.
 “It just opens it up. The Premier League have put in some stringent measures and testing and I think we’ve seen the results of that, I think we’ve seen the results of that at our football club too.

Diana, Princess of Wales wanted to appear on the BBC’s flagship Panorama programme a decade before she gave a bombshell interview to the documentary series, a former television executive has claimed.
 Stewart Purvis said he was struck when Diana mentioned her “secret ambition” to him and when she finally appeared on Panorama in 1995, sending shockwaves through the monarchy with her comments about the state of her marriage.
 The former TV boss said he could not believe that BBC director-general Tim Davie would not want to get to the bottom of new allegations made by Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer that he was shown false financial documents by then- Panorama reporter Martin Bashir to gain access to her.

 Mr Purvis, who worked on documentaries with the Prince and Princess of Wales, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “She said one thing which struck me as really odd at the time, which was ‘What I’d really like to do, I’d like to appear on Panorama’.
 “And I thought ‘Gosh, what an unusual thing for her to say’. So, when I heard a decade later that she’d finally appeared on Panorama, I suppose in a sense it was a mission accomplished.”
 In the weeks before the programme, the earl was approached by Mr Bashir and, in what are believed to be new details, Charles Spencer now claims he was shown “false bank statements” that related to alleged payments made to two members of the royal household by the security services.

 The Hoops slumped to a painful 4-1 Europa League defeat against Sparta Prague on Thursday night to extend their recent run of woe to just one win in their last six games in all competitions.
 Lennon is coming under increasing pressure to turn things around and salvage his sides’s quest for a historic 10th-straight Premiership title.

 The on-loan Wigan striker said: “It probably is quite a good time for us to be facing Celtic, obviously on the back of us getting some wins – so this probably is the best time to play them.

CHAMPAIGN -- Ask Da'Monte Williams or Adam Miller about those steamy, intense workouts at the Hanna City Park District gym, and you'll get similar answers.


   


  The two Peoria hoopers now play ball under the bright lights and in the luxurious atmosphere of the State Farm Center in Champaign, but they'll never forget where they started -- drilling day after day under the tutelage of Manual assistant coach David Williams.


   


  "Man, them workouts with Dave were hot," Miller recalled. "Hot in that gym. The fan was barely helping us. We learned a lot."


   


  "Man, we used to get it," Da'Monte said. "Can't really say too much about those, but we definitely got after it though."


   


  Usually early in the morning, the training sessions were especially pivotal in Miller's development, starting when he was in seventh grade, when Da'Monte played at Manual.


   


  Before the two talented hoopers grew into Big Ten-worthy talents that drew loads of hype and accolades, David got their buy-in, and the trio turned that sauna of a gym into a hotbed of basketball promise.


   


  Both Miller and David recalled one particular session when they were working on a drill where Miller dunked the ball instead of finishing with a right- handed layup.


   


  Unimpressed with the flair, David let Miller know that the athleticism and skill of defenders at the next level would prevent him from dunking in games.


   


  "Right hand!" David bellowed. "You ain't ever gonna be able to do that (expletive) in the game! At some point, you've got to make a right-hand layup!"


   


  The four-year-old video drew a reminiscent chuckle from Miller, who was speaking ahead of his freshman season on an Illini team that has Final Four hopes after a resurgent 2019-2020 season.


   


  "Coach Dave, he pushed me every practice," Miller said. "We work hard. Some of the things he taught me back then, I still use to this day. Just building a foundation and making connections, Coach Dave is like a father figure. He's someone I've got in my corner. Them workouts, I don't take them for granted."


   


  Known for his intensity, David knew Miller had an abundance of potential, from the moment Da'Monte asked if he could attend a training session when Miller was in middle school. That's why he never held back, pushing him to be his greatest -- and particularly -- to make full use of his right hand instead of Miller's favored left.


   


  "He was only a freshman, so not knowing he was going to be in the Big Ten at that time, no foreshadowing there," David said. "But just telling him, 'You're not gonna do that in the Big Ten, you've got to learn how to use that right hand.'


   


  "To his credit, he worked on that right hand, and that's one of the big things we harp on him a lot, that right hand, that right hand. He's gotten so much better with it."


   


  Four years later, ahead of his first college season, Miller has grown a lot. He now stands at 6 feet, 4 inches, and he's added more than 10 pounds of muscle between working out near Peoria over the summer and entering the Illini's strength and conditioning program.


   


  "His athleticism really, really impressed me," David said. "How much stronger he has gotten in the upper body and how much bouncier he is now than he used to be. I know he trains over at 360 in East Peoria with Eric Crowhurst. He really looks good. He's bought into weightlifting, his body looks good, but his athleticism off the floor has really, really improved."


   


  Longtime friends, Miller and Da'Monte reunited for summer workouts with David while away from campus because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The familiar confines of the Hanna City Park District gym, easily accessible for a trio of longtime area basketball standouts, beckoned.


   


  By all accounts, the trio's training sessions were just like the old days.


   


  "There's no air conditioning in that gym," David said. "When I tell you it's 104 degrees in that gym, it is hot. Some days I'm in a bad mood and I won't even open the door, standing in there is like a sauna. There's been great days in there and there's been days that have been not-so-great. But that comes with maturing, and these guys have gotten better and better, and have bought in. They understand that at the next level, you've got to be prepared."


   


  For David, it was thrilling to see each player's progress, but also the degree to which they still bought in and wanted to learn from him. After years of drilling, now at a high-level Big Ten program, each player still has a place for David's coaching, mentorship and friendship.


   


  "My relationship with him and Dave has a long history," Miller said. "We work hard. Some of the things he taught me back then, I still use to this day. Just building a foundation and making connections, Coach Dave is like a father figure. He's someone I've got in my corner. Them workouts, I don't take them for granted."


   


  For he and Da'Monte, too, the relationship goes deeper than being training buddies who share a particularly intense and memorable teacher.


   


  "We're super close, whether on the court or off the court," Da'Monte said. "We look at each other as family. Especially with me, family's big. I treat him like my mother had him. He treats me the same way."


   


  Miller recounted how Da'Monte was the first player he ever saw truly dominate a basketball game in every facet, from the offensive end to the defensive end.


   


  "He was like a Michael Jordan to me," Miller said. "I had never seen, in my actual own eyes, someone dominate a game."


   


  "So me seeing that and him getting offers, playing with the (Mac Irvin) Fire, him doing that kind of showed me like, 'Oh, I can do this too. I could go out there, you've just got to go do it,'" Miller said. "Me and my mom, we pushed to go do it. I always give thanks to Da'Monte because without him I probably wouldn't be as successful as I am today."


   


  When David thinks back to how it all got started, with Miller first attending training sessions after Da'Monte's introduction, he can't help but remember it as the stuff of legend.


   


  "His mom had asked me, 'Can he come work out with you and Da'Monte?' I knew he was young, seventh grade," David said. "So one day we're in the back gym and I said, 'Sure. He can come come tomorrow.' So she brings him to the back gym, and I thought she was going stay for the workout. She didn't, she walked out. We worked out for about an hour and a half that day, and Adam says, 'I'll see you guys tomorrow!'"


   


  "He was pretty excited," David continued. "And he left, and I told Da'Monte right then and there that he's the next great player to come out of Peoria. Monte's like, 'You think so?' I said, 'There is no doubt, Da'Monte. There is zero doubt.'"


   


  Now, with the Illini's season set to begin in about four weeks, David hopes to see Miller and Da'Monte click at Illinois like they have over the years.


   


  Whether Miller finds immediate success, or even if Illinois doesn't live up to expectations, it's clear the two Illini guards have a special relationship that has made Miller more comfortable to call Champaign home.


   


  "That's my big brother," Miller said of Da'Monte. "We work hard and we feed off each other. We know how each other work and we push each other. I don't really gotta say too much about him."


   


  "The bond brothers have is, 'I got your back and you got mine,'" Miller continued. "He's gonna teach me what to do. He's gonna tell me little secrets that nobody knows, he's gonna teach me that. It's good to have him out here helping me out."

Ace Indian cricketer Virat Kohli believes the length of the series amid the ongoing Covid 19 pandemic should be given a serious thought as staying in a bio bubble for long periods does affect the mental health of the players. Kohli is currently leading Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian Premier League IPL 13 edition being held in the United Arab Emirates due to the Covid 19 situation in India. RCB will be taking SunRisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator on Friday evening. It s repetitive, it s not as tough when the group of guys is amazing, which we have. Everyone part of that bio bubble is really nice and the vibe has been so good. That s precisely why we ve enjoyed playing together, just enjoyed our time in the bubble as well, but it does get difficult at times because it is repetitive, Kohli said while speaking to RCB TV. These things will have to be considered. Like what length of the tournament or series one is going to play and what impact it will have on players mentally to stay in a similar environment for 80 days and not do anything different. Or have space to just go and see family or small things like that. These things have to be thought about seriously, he added. Kohli, who turned 32 on Thursday, further said that these conversations should taken place on regular intervals. At the end of the day, you want the players to be in the best state mentally, based on how they re feeling, the Indian skipper said. Soon after the completion of IPL, the Indian team will be travelling to Australia for three ODIs, three T20Is and four Test matches to be played in a bio secure environment from November 27 to January 15 next year.

Former England captain Nasser Hussain has said that he was lucky enough to have been brought up as a white ish middle class in a multi racial society and play his cricket in a multi cultural club like Essex that ensured that he experienced very little racism. I encountered very little racism at Essex. Growing up as a young boy in Ilford having been born in India and having a surname of Hussain and a first name of Nasser I did encounter some name calling due to ignorance, Hussain told PakPassion.net I was lucky enough to play at a club like Essex where we had a middle order of Nadeem Shahid, Saleem Malik and myself. We had a very multi cultural county in the south of our county at Ilford where I grew up with my dad and his cricket school where we had a British West Indian net, British Indian net and a British Pakistani net and we would all take the mickey out of each other when India were playing Pakistan, or England were losing to the West Indies. It was great banter and it was fun, he said. Hussain said he was fortunate enough to have come from a white ish middle class, privileged background. I grew up in that multi cultural environment and I was very fortunate. But I understand that I was a white ish middle class, public school educated boy so I can t put myself in the shoes of some of the British Asians that are growing up in certain parts of the UK, he said. Hussain also said that Pakistan batting mainstay Babar Azam has the potential to end up as one of the greats. Babar has what it takes to become one of the greats. In white ball cricket he is up there with the best of them. He is up near the top of the rankings in T20Is, and in fifty over cricket he is exceptional too, Hussain pointed out. He did okay in the Test series against England bearing in mind England is not an easy place to come and play Test cricket. He just needs that consistency in Test cricket to be up there with the likes of Virat Kohli. Babar s done that for six to nine months so far. He just needs to be consistent for a longer period of time.

 But in comical fashion, the 25-year-old Olympian had miscounted the number of lengths he had done and subsequently stopped with two more still to go.
 After looking around confused for several seconds, Rapsys realised his error and in a panicked state pushed off the wall to complete the race.
 With the world record now gone, the swimmer was simply fighting for the race win and appeared to be fading in the final burst for the line.
 But he managed to hold on by the slenderest of margins, fending off American Zane Grothe by just 0.1 second.

So you noted the volume has ramped up to $250 million this quarter, and that math suggests it’s in the ballpark give or take about 1% of seller volume. So it seems like a long runway ahead, and I was hoping you could give maybe some added thoughts on some of the things that either you have been doing or can do to address this opportunity. It does seem like a long runway for a product that really seems to be a win-win for the sellers and for Square.

Leeds manager Marcelo Bielsa wants to see a reaction from his team against Crystal Palace.
 After a solid start to the season on their return to the Premier League, Leeds have lost two of their last three matches – the latest of which was a 4-1 home defeat to Leicester on Monday night.
 Bielsa’s side will look to bounce back at Selhurst Park, with one eye on a third-straight away win.
 “We want a response, but the response will be evaluated in the performance in the next game,” said the Leeds boss.
 “The response is always subject to the result in the next game. What happens during the week, we don’t give too much importance to it.
 “There are things to improve and work on – the coach too. I didn’t distribute the players properly on the pitch against Leicester, the help I gave the players on how to defend and attack better, I didn’t give it.”
 Palace have made a similar start to Leeds in the Premier League, with both clubs heading into the game on 10 points.

No, there will not be a state cross country meet at Detweiller Park this year for the first time in 50 years.


   


  But just 8 miles down the road on Route 29, the next best thing will take place this weekend.


   


  Three Sisters Park plays host to the Shazam Racing 2020 XC Championships in three divisions, starting Friday and ending Sunday.


   


  "We have the best of the best coming," said Shazam founder Adam White. "We can't call it a state meet, but I'd be hard pressed for any college in the U.S. to say what's happening down here this coming weekend is not the meet to prospect and recruit from for cross country in the fall of 2020."


   


  Sectional races concluded the Illinois High School Association season last weekend.


   


  Shazam Racing and co-sponsor MileSplit Illinois used those sectional results, as well as the entire regular season and regionals, as the barometer to invite 20 teams and 30 additional individuals in each of three divisions to the first of its kind event.


   


  "Couldn't be more thrilled," White said of the response from cross country teams around the state. "This is working out just the way we hoped and envisioned it would become, with the top teams and individuals in each division filling out those applications."


   


  Division I -- or Class 1A in IHSA terms -- starts the weekend on Friday, followed by Division II (2A) on Saturday and Division III (3A) on Sunday.


   


  Races begin at 9 a.m. each day on the 400-acre park at the south edge of Chillicothe.


   


  The series premiered last weekend with the middle school event on a windy Sunday morning.


   


  "We could have done without the 30-mile and hour wind, (but) it was great," said Shazam lead timer and co-founder Brad Henz. "Tons of smiles on the faces. You could even tell with all the people with their masks on out watching that they were smiling too and just glad to have this opportunity to race."


   


  The event received high praise from the Chillicothe police officers and Peoria County deputies hired to make sure all involved were following COVID-19 protocols provided by the Peoria County Health Department.


   


  Those same protocols will be enforced this weekend.


   


  There are four flights each for boys and girls. The middle school event started with top runners first and ending with No. 6-7 runners on each team. But the organizers decided to end with No. 1 runners this weekend.


   


  "I like the idea of building up to the big race," Henz said. "Some of those 2-3 runners, there are some teams with serious studs and if they set the precedent, then that makes for a little more pressure (on the No. 1 runners)."


   


  With such spacious land at Three Sisters, an Athlete Village was set up to maintain social distance. Each team is assigned its own 30 feet by 50 feet roped-off space for tents.


   


  Temperature checks will be taken of every individual as each car enters the facility, with a police officer located at the check-point station. All spectators and non-participants will be asked to wear masks at all times.


   


  The fact the majority of the top individuals and top teams are entered in the event dispelled any concerns that competitors would not come to a location other than Detweiller Park.


   


  "I was never concerned about that," White said. "What the kids want is to compete at the highest level. Competitors don't care where, they just want the forum to be able to show themselves and each other who's who."


   


  Count Limestone junior Wilson Georges as one of those excited for the opportunity. Georges enters with the top Class 2A boys time in the state.


   


  "I'm just going to go out there and run my fastest and try to win," Georges said. "Illinois is a very competitive cross country state, so if I could possibly go out and win the closest thing we've got to state this year, it would give me a lot of confidence going into next year. I just want to represent my school and my teammates well out there."

Are you one of those individuals who sometimes have this intense love and compassion towards your partner and the next minute you don't see any love existing between the two of you? You, my friend, is falling in and out of love. This is a human thing to do but the other person in the relationship suffers a lot because of this. Here are three things that you can do if you keep falling in and out of love. 1\. Introspect and see how much have you contributed  in the relationshipWhenever you tend to lose your interest in your partner, it is time for you to ask yourself as to how much effort have you made to perk up the relationship. We always expect our partner to make things happen for us, but do we do our bit? Focus on why you fell in love with them in the first place. And be sure to create a support system around you and be surrounded with people who wants the two of you to be together.2. Step into your partner's shoes Put yourself in your partner's place and see what he or she would be going through if their partner turned out to be so fickle-minded and unable to decide what he or she wants out of the relationship. This strategy will make you more empathetic and perhaps you wouldn't be so impulsive in taking such decisions at the drop of a hat.3. Make sure you don't force it in the beginning A lot of times, you tend to fall out of love too soon is because you have forced yourself in the beginning into loving someone more than you felt like. And later you regret that their wasn't so much love that you shared. So it  is necessary that you don't force yourself into loving someone in the beginning. With inputs from relationship experts Able Joseph and Jai Madan.

Faith became an important element in Barber's journey when he needed it most. He grew up in a Christian family and accepted Jesus at a young age, but during his freshman year of college, he fell behind in classes and broke some rules along the way, which eventually led to a rough patch in his life. That following spring semester, he was ineligible for the baseball season. After realizing that he will never be content without Jesus at the center of his life, he decided to rededicate his life during his sophomore year of college. Barber explained, “I wanted my life to count for something. I wanted to be a man of God. Ultimately I want to be a good father, a good husband, and a good coach.” As a coach, Barber voices to his players that the Holy Spirit will bring you wisdom, understanding, and even knowledge. He explains the spiritual journey could be difficult, but he wants everyone to know he or she always have a helper. In the Christian walk of faith, you will have the Holy Spirit joining you along the way. He said that at times you don’t have to rely on self-will. You can be weak and still answer God’s call for your life because He is always there.

And that's not short- term confidence because that's not how we operate the company. I remind people we increased our guidance by almost $500 million at the end of the first quarter.

The soccer team practices three times a week this fall. This leaves more time for them to grow together on and off the field. Soccer-wise, everything has changed with how many practices per week and how practices are run. Arthur says, “It gives our team a lot of opportunities to learn formation and really vibe with each other before having to play actual games against real competition.” She is really looking forward to the spring, even with plans being up in the air and always likely to change. Being a senior comes with a lot of expectations, especially finishing the last season with a SLIAC title coming back to Greenville. Seniors are dealing with a different situation this season with COVID forcing the season to the spring, and the NCAA is giving the seniors an option to play an extra season. This opens the door for many options, especially for Arthur. Arthur has been preparing applications for biomedical engineering Master's programs all over the country with a chance to gain new experiences. The extra year of eligibility, however, has opened even more doors of opportunity. She is pondering these opportunities at Greenville or possibly elsewhere to use the extra year of eligibility.

The landscape of the US presidential election is shifting rapidly in the remaining undecided states. Former Vice President Joe Biden has pulled ahead in Georgia, a shocking development in a traditional Republican stronghold. He's also gaining on President Trump in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes remain to be counted. Races in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Alaska are also too close to call. A little math: Biden's still at 253 Electoral College votes (some outlets have called Arizona for the Democrat, but his lead there has shrunk, and CNN, among others, has not made a projection). Trump is at 213 electoral votes. Remember, the magic number is 270, so a win in Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, would put Biden over the top. The Keystone State may finish its reporting today. Georgia carries 16 votes, Arizona 11, Nevada 6, North Carolina 15 and Alaska 3.

Northern Ireland’s highest court has ruled that loyalist killer Michael Stone can apply for early release from prison.
 It said keeping the notorious paramilitary behind bars until at least 2024 would “constitute an interference with the physical liberty of the prisoner and could only arise under clear authority of the law”, and in its view this could not be implied.
 In 1988, Stone killed three people in a gun and grenade attack at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast.
 Stone was freed early from prison in 2000 under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.
 He was sent back six years later after attempting to attack Sinn Fein politicians at Stormont.
 Stone is serving a 30-year jail term. The issue under consideration was whether he would stay in jail until at least 2024, or whether his minimum tariff expired in 2018, including the six years he was freed under licence.
 Stone launched an appeal against efforts to keep him in prison.
