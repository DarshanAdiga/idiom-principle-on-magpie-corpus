Okay, so DSLRs are great, but what exactly are they? To break it down, a DSLR has a mirror inside its body that reflects the image coming through the lens into a viewfinder. You can look through this viewfinder to see what you’re shooting in real time, so you can adjust all of your elements such as frame, focus and much more. As the light passes from the mirror to the viewfinder, it goes through a prism or another set of mirrors that creates the image. When you’re ready to take the shot, the mirror flips up in the blink of an eye to expose the sensor and take the picture. That satisfying _kerchunk_ you associate with big cameras? That’s this process.

As a young reporter, Jan Morris was on the mountainside, at 22,000 feet, when the first expedition in history reached the top of Mount Everest. She reported on wars and revolutions around the globe, published dozens of elegant books exploring far-flung places and times and was regarded as perhaps the greatest travel writer of her time.
 Yet the most remarkable journey of her life was across a private border, when she cast off her earlier identity as James Morris and became Jan Morris.
 A writer of extraordinary range and productivity, and one of the world's first well-known transgender public figures, Morris was 94 when she died Nov. 20 at a hospital in the Welsh town of Pwllheli. Her son Twm Morys announced the death in a statement but did not state the cause.
 Jan Morris spent her first 45 years as James Morris, who had been a British cavalry officer, a World War II veteran and a dashing reporter renowned for international adventures and evocative writing.
 "On the face of things," a onetime colleague, David Holden, wrote in 1974, "a less likely candidate for a sex change than James Morris would have been hard to imagine. His whole career and reputation had created an aura of glamorous and successful masculinity."
 In the 1940s, James Morris lived on the Nile on the houseboat of British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. In 1953, never having climbed a mountain before, James joined the expedition of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay and came within 7,000 feet of the summit of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak. Scrambling back down, James delivered the news that Everest had been conquered for the first time in history. The Times of London printed the story on the eve of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

But huge numbers of those detained languish behind bars for days, weeks or months simply because their bail exceeds their financial means. Meanwhile, other defendants charged with the same offenses walk free because they have the money to buy their way out.
 Those unjust realities have spawned a movement to eliminate cash bail for most defendants, replacing them with “personal recognizance bonds” — a promise to appear in court. Among the jurisdictions that have adopted the change is Cook County, which in 2017 began using money bonds less often, while reducing the amounts on those it imposed.
 But this year, Chicago has been hit with a tidal wave of shootings and homicides, and critics — notably police Superintendent David Brown — immediately blamed those bail reforms. If more arrestees were required to provide money for bail, the argument goes, fewer of them would be released and the community would be safer.
 There’s some truth to this theory. If everyone arrested were denied bail, none would commit crimes. But that’s never been a realistic approach. Even before Cook County adopted these changes, the great majority of defendants were freed before trial.
 Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans has long defended the reforms, even after a Tribune investigation challenged them. The Tribune investigation maintained that an assessment by the judge’s office of the reforms’ impact had undercounted violent crimes allegedly committed by people out on bail.
 The latest independent research indicates that the reforms have had only a marginal effect on the number of defendants allowed out. It rose from 77% of those arrested to 81%, according to a new study by criminologists Don Stemen and David Olson of Loyola University Chicago, who examined the six months before and after the reforms took effect. That represents 500 more defendants.
 The difference is that 57% of those freed didn’t have to come up with cash, compared with 26% before. And 80% of those released didn’t miss a single court appearance, only a slight decline. There was a huge measurable benefit to defendants and their families — a savings of $31 million in bail costs.
 From the evidence, the releases didn’t generate a surge in violence. Before and after the changes, about 17% of the released defendants were rearrested. The share rearrested for violent crimes also remained stable, at about 3%. The overall crime rate, Stemen and Olson found, was not affected.

When a camera has a full frame sensor, that means that whatever you’re looking at through the lens is exactly what will be exposed to the sensor. With smaller sensors, you get what’s called the cropping affect, which can actually crop out some of the image you’re seeing through the viewfinder, which is a big downside when trying to get wide angle shots. The pixels on a full frame sensor will also be larger, allowing you to play with a shallower depth of field (think Portrait Mode to the max). However, full frame cameras are much more expensive than cropped frame ones.

The COVID-19 pandemic already has significantly altered the Big Ten schedule.
 Wisconsin’s anticipated nine-game schedule is now down to seven after two of its games were canceled due to a team-wide coronavirus pandemic. Nebraska and Purdue, the two teams Wisconsin was supposed to face the second and third week of the season, are down to eight games. In addition, Maryland and Ohio State are down to eight games after Maryland was forced to cancel its game with the Buckeyes on Saturday due to a coronavirus outbreak in which eight Maryland players tested positive.
 The Big Ten has released a statement teams must play at least six games to be considered for the conference championship game, which gives Wisconsin no more wiggle room (Wisconsin’s seventh game would be the conference title game). If an average number of conference games played falls below six, that number would reduce to three to four games, depending on the final average (two fewer than the average number of conference games).

When it comes to dollar-denominated bonds, our recommendation is actually at the emerging markets level. That asset class can continue to offer good risk-adjusted returns on the back of an attractive carry of close to 4.8% in U.S. dollar terms, plus the potential for close to 40 basis points in spread compression. Within that, we do see opportunities in Latin America. We play them within the asset class, not standalone.

Elizabert is one of the most prominent characters in Bugsnax. That being said, her headstrong nature and uncanny ability to bite off a bit more than she can chew at times is something I can relate to very well.

Hatfill successfully sued the FBI for nearly $6 million for undue harassment and Ivins conveniently killed himself before ever being charged with any crime. In the end, not a single person was arrested or indicted for their participation in one of the highest profile attacks in American history.

We are projecting policy rates at zero or negative in the U.S. and Europe for many years to come. In the better managed LatAm economies, without pressing fiscal issues, this would be supportive of low rates domestically for longer. Chile and Peru are two clear exponents of that trend. Countries with more serious macroeconomic challenges, particularly in the fiscal front — think Brazil and Argentina — might face pressures to hike rates. Argentina is already experiencing this and has been tightening financial conditions against the grain of the rest of the world. Brazil hasn't yet, but they might be forced to, particularly if we see a mishandling of the spending cap. These factors make fixed-income assets less attractive. But you need to see where rate differentials stand, and whether it makes sense to take local or hard currency exposure. At the moment, the latter makes more sense and offers a good risk-reward; there's still some risk premia that needs to be priced out. When it comes to equities, lower rates are usually good, and usually justify higher multiples.

Dr. Robert Berthold Jr.   Dr. Robert Berthold Jr. died peacefully on November 17, 2020 at the age of 79.   Born on August 2, 1941 in Paterson, New Jersey, Dr. Berthold was a college professor, a beekeeper, a candlemaker and tinsmith, a runner, a coach, a husband and father.   After earning degrees from Juniata College, Rutgers University and Penn State University, Dr. Berthold (aka "Doc") went on to teach biology, entomology and apiculture at Delaware Valley College, now Delaware Valley University, for over 30 years. He was a member and officer of the Bucks County Apiary Society, the Montgomery County Apiary Society and the Eastern Apiculture Society. He shared his knowledge and enthusiasm for beekeeping in many short courses and workshops all over the world. He published numerous articles on beekeeping and queen rearing and authored a book titled Beeswax Crafting. He worked as an apiary inspector for the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture for over a decade. He was well known for his bee-beard demonstrations at A-Day.   Running was an important part of Dr. Berthold's life. A star athlete in high school and college track and cross country, he was inducted into the Athletic Hall of Fame at Juniata College for his accomplishments. He coached men's and women's cross country and track at Delaware Valley College for over 30 years. He started the first women's cross-country team at Del Val, and founded the Turkey Trot, a race that has run each fall to this day. He took several running teams to the MAC championships. His quirky sense of humor infused his team workouts and award ceremonies. His efforts to instill his love of running in his children and wife were met with mixed results.   On August 6th,1966, Bob married his sweetheart, Marren Cummings, on the square in Morristown, New Jersey. They honeymooned in Cape Cod. Together, Bob and Marnie shared many decades raising children, gardening, preserving food, traveling, attending events at the college, and enjoying evening walks hand in hand.   Dr. Berthold was known for his off-color jokes, for his love of safety and routine, for his dedication to oral hygiene, for waking up very early to make candles and candle molds in the basement while humming loudly, for his love of Laurel and Hardy and Sha Na Na, and for his voracious reading of anything from science journals to science fiction. He was an inventor and craftsman, skilled at both making and fixing things. He had a long relationship with his Gravely tractor, which he kept running for at least 4 decades. He was known for his ideas about healthy living, ranging from wheat germ and vitamins to his home- made High Energy Candy.   Dr. Berthold is survived by his loving wife of 54 years, Marren, and his children, Heather and Rob, Rob's wife Lara, and three smart, sassy granddaughters, Ruby, Cora and Kyla.   Dr. Berthold's family would like to thank the Park Creek Place Memory Care Community and Grane Hospice Care for their compassionate care and attention. A celebration of Robert's life will be held at a later date.   Donations in his name to provide ongoing support to the beekeeping community can be made to the Montgomery County Beekeepers' Association at montcopabees.org/bee-involved.

On top of their price gouging, sites like Amazon and eBay also fall short in terms of consumer transparency. A study undertaken by The Washington Post found that for every dollar shoppers spend on products from third-party sellers via Amazon, the site takes one-third (35 per cent) in commission. Unsurprisingly, due to Amazon's required revenue share third-party merchants inflate their prices to cover the mark-up costs. This is mirrored with eBay, which charges a 10 per cent commission fee and a 3.5 per cent processing fee for consumers, but are slow to disclose this to their customers.

Phillip Ross Daniels      1946 – 2020            Phillip Ross Daniels left this earth unexpectedly on November 16, 2020. He had the opportunity of spending his 74th and last birthday elk hunting with his son Phil, AKA "Spike," and eldest grandson Logan.      Phil began his bigger-than-life journey on October 9, 1946 in Billings, Montana, with his father Herbert Grant Daniel and mother Margaret Alice Smith. He grew up in Bozeman Montana next to the Montana State University with those big wonderful barns and plenty of friends to help discover the world of knowledge--camping, fishing, scouting, hunting; snow-sledding, ice skating and just about anything a growing boy would want to learn. He sold and delivered newspapers and played junior high basketball.      The last day of junior high school, his family moved to Bountiful, Utah. His mother remarried Earl Johnson, whom he lovingly referred to as "Pal." He graduated from Bountiful High School in 1965 and attended the University of Utah and Weber State, where he received an Associate Degree and a Bachelor's of Science degree with a minor in Zoology.      He owned and managed his own residential and commercial cleaning maintenance business, which took him into many people's homes and businesses where he had the opportunity to chat with them while he went about his work. He had the unique ability to tell anecdotes in a skillful and amusing way and was truly a raconteur. Besides being entertained while he was in their presence, many a client marveled at how their windows sparkled or their walls were transformed after he applied his "secret cleaning formula." He later became a marketing consultant as well as a substitute teacher.      In 1974, he married Marjean Jones, later divorced, and welcomed his son Phillip Ross Daniels, Jr. into his life in 1979. He married Ann Jenkins in 1983 in the Salt Lake Temple. Ann was a wonderful companion and they traveled extensively together. They went around the world 2 ½ times and visited just about every corner of the earth.      His passion for genealogy reunited many members of his expansive family, including some of his family in Germany with those who had been lost when they immigrated to America. He and Ann also met other family and relatives during trips to Spain and Argentina.            A bit of a Renaissance man, he loved learning and read voraciously. Phil, Ann and Phil Jr. built their log home and together with Phil Jr., he restored his 1976 Cadillac El Dorado convertible.      His ancestors were some of the original pioneers arriving on the wagon train with Brigham Young. He was proud of his pioneer heritage. He had the gift of gab and was able to learn from every person whom he met. Always full of stories from his connections with people over the years, Phil could hold court for hours. People who knew him found him to be a kind, just and honest person who touched their lives. He loved the Lord and the Gospel of Jesus Christ.      Throughout his life, he always had at least one dog by his side and loved all animals. At one time, he raised Dobermans and participated in Kennel Club dog shows. His blue Doberman earned the award of being named Stud Dog of the Year two years running.      He will be missed by his wife Ann, his son Phil Jr. and his grandchildren, Logan, Jaxson and Addison. He will also be missed by his faithful furry companions, Rosie, Buster, Minnie, Bonnie, McTavish and McCoy. His friends and worldwide family will always remember him and the impact that he had on their lives.      Due to Covid, a memorial service will be scheduled at a later date.

He spends little time complaining, whining, or adding to troubles (and if he does add to troubles, he takes it very personally). He's doesn't necessarily have all the specialties that other Grumpuses can boast, but despite that, he tries his best anyways. He's good at identifying what needs to be done and isn't afraid to depend on others to help him do it. No Grumpus runs Snaxburg alone! And in return, in a tough time, he invites everyone to look to him, whether he can necessarily help or not, and even whether they like him or not. Filbo is a gold heart in the stormy seas of Snaktooth Island. Where other Grumpuses have their own priorities, he just wants people to be happy… and party every once in a while as any good Grumpus should.

I like to think that I'm a grumpy little man with a heart of gold. I can be a bit aloof and off-putting, but deep down, I'm a totally friendly guy. Part of me feels for Cromdo. He's such a jerk, but there's something about him that strikes me as... well... he just looks misunderstood. He's not a bad guy. He just has a tough outer shell, that's all. I can sympathize with that. He's a good Grumpus, deep down, even if he does spend a chunk of the game trying to cheat you.

"Mourinho has to speak to the doctor for the national team of England and the doctor for Manchester City," the City boss said.
 "He has to go to the doctors of the national team and Manchester City. Except maybe Mourinho is a doctor, I don’t know."
 Mourinho had also accused City's players of diving earlier this month, saying players at City, United and Liverpool are "clever guys where somebody blows on them and they are on the floor."
 But Guardiola would not be drawn on that claim and was keen not to reignite a feud with Mourinho dating back to their days in La Liga.
 "Listen, I’m not going to answer anything about Jose," said Guardiola "I said the doctor because he accused us of something we have done that is not true. You have to speak to the doctors about these other things, don’t ask me."
 In hinting that Guardiola had played a role in keeping Sterling away from England's three games this month, Mourinho highlighted the case of Eric Dier, who returned from international duty last month and missed action for Spurs.

The Nigerian youth made a clear and unequivocal statement on the sordid state of the nation. A critical, objective and unbiased interrogation, introspection and socio-political analysis of the state of our nation depicts a gloomy and frightful picture of a failing, nay failed state. Look at the optics, matrix, metrics, stats and ethics. They tell and paint a gloomy and frightening story and picture of the state of anomie and dystopia. Massive and systemic corruption has over the decades inflicted crippling poverty on 80 percent of the population with the attendant rise in insecurity and escalation of violent crimes and mass killings. Critical infrastructures have completely broken down and remain primitive; roads are in decrepit condition and there is no electric power to drive the economy. Despite the questionable privatization exercise and the huge resources poured into this critical sector over the years, we are operating a ‘dark’ economy in a global economy driven by hi-tech. The core social services in the education and health sectors are virtually nonexistent. A huge army of out-of-school children and unemployed youths roam about our cities and villages, an ever-ready recruitment resource pool for criminals and insurgents. Health care services are unavailable and unaffordable with ill- equipped facilities and ill-motivated medical staff. On virtually every human development index, we are in the red. If these are not symptomatic of a failed state, what is?
