Michigan State took a three-point lead late in the game, but could not hold on as Penn State pulled out a 75-70 win on Feb. 4 ... Cassius Winston scored 25 points and had nine assists to lead the Michigan State, while Xavier Tillman added nine points, 11 rebounds, two assists, and five blocked shots ... The Spartans took a 66-63 lead on a 3-pointer from Winston with 5:29 to play, but a jumper from Lamar Stevens gave PSU a 67-66 lead ... A pair of free throws gave PSU a 69-66 lead before Aaron Henry hit a jumper to cut the lead to one ... Winston hit a layup and was fouled with 11 seconds left to make it 71-70, but his free throw was off the mark and Nittany Lions hit four free throws to seal the win.

Chelsea signed Kepa Arrizabalaga for £71million a week after Liverpool announced the capture of Roma superstar Alisson. The Blues were interested in the Brazilian, but the Reds reportedly ‘forced’ them to sign an alternative target.
 The move has been described as ‘desperate’ by the Liverpool Echo who claim Chelsea were forced to pay Kepa’s massive release clause or be left with Willy Caballero as their first choice stopper.
 Fortune has favoured the Liverpool man: Ali has picked up medals for winning the Champions League, Copa America, Club World Cup and will soon add the Premier League to his growing collection.
 Kepa has only won the Europa League – by no way am I suggesting that isn’t a good thing, but it simply cannot be compared with Alisson.
 Liverpool and Chelsea are to lock horns in the FA Cup tonight, and Kepa may get the nod at Stamford Bridge, but our main man won’t be between the sticks as Adrian will deputise for the Brazilian.
 The former Athletic Bilbao man has recently been dropped, in favour of Caballero, and with reports of a poor attitude – as per the Express, it’s unclear whether he’s now considered the No.1 at Chelsea or not.

  With presidential voting underway in Massachusetts, it remains an open question what Republican Gov. Charlie Baker will do when he pulls a ballot later this evening. The only thing he's said for sure is that he won't be voting for President Donald Trump, whose supporters plan to gather in Quincy.


  While many statewide officials, including Secretary of State William Galvin, and U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey voted early this morning, Baker is not expected to arrive at the polling location across the street from his Swampscott home until tonight. Aides to the governor say he is expected to vote after work, probably close to 7 p.m.


  Baker has said that he doesn't want to get involved in presidential politics, though he has said that like in 2016 he won't be voting for Trump. Also on the Republican presidential primary ballot in Massachusetts is former Gov. William Weld, former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh, who suspended his campaign last month, and Roque de la Fuente.


  Baker will also have a choice on his ballot between incumbent Republican State Committee member and former Salem State University trustee Richaerd Zykofsky and challenger Richard Wood. Amy Carnevale is the only woman running for the other GOP State Committee seat in the Third Essex District.


  Baker's name is also on the ballot. He is one of 20 people, including former Republican nominee for secretary of state Anthony Amore, running for 35 seats on the Swampscott Republican Town Committee.


  The Massachusetts Republican Party, the president's Massachusetts campaign chairman Sheriff Tom Hodgson and Republican National Committeeman Ron Kaufman will be hosting a Super Tuesday party at the Victory Point Restaurant and Bar in Marina Bay, Quincy starting at 7:30 p.m. A Baker political aide did not respond when asked if the governor, the state's top elected Republican, planned to meet up with his party mates in Quincy.

Coming up empty on a string of empty possessions gave cause for the Westran boys have its 2019-2020 basketball season come to and end Saturday afternoon as the Hornets lost the Class 2 District 6 tournament championship game to Milan 62-46 at Schuyler County High School in Queen City.
   
 Eddie Gonzalez scored a game-high 22 points and Ryan Dabney had 12 for Milan (23-3). The Wildcats advance to the state sectional playoff game and meet Van- Far of Vandalia (22-6) at 7:45 p.m. Tuesday at Hannibal High School.
   
 Westran was challenged for much of their district play as 12 of the 15 Hornet players were battling flu-like illness on Monday. By week's end, Hornet boys coach Chris Sander said most of them recovered fairly well but their strength may not have been up to par, including himself on Saturday.
   
 The Wildcats led 20-13 after the first quarter, 34-23 at the break and Milan outscored Westran 14 to 10 in the third segment.
   
 However, Sander was quick to point out that this was not an excuse and that Milan had a very good team and poses a strong challenge against any team they face.
   
 "Early in the game teams were exchanging baskets and then we had a stretch where we struggled to get shots to fall and did not get defensive stops. Milan scored some run-outs on us, hit some threes to extend their lead to 11 at halftime to space the game out," said Hornets coach Sander. "We struggled to get out of that hole in the second half as we missed three open 3-pointers in our first three possessions. Milan was able to stretch the game out a little more from there."
   
 Karter Koenig paced the Hornets (18-6) with 14 points, Trey Burton had 11 while Treyton Black added six.
   
 "Us reaching the district championship game was something we had high hopes for at the beginning of our season. Winning a conference championship for the second year in a row was our first goal and something we felt we could do, which we did, and another goal was to reach 20 wins of which we fell a bit short. There were two games that were cancelled because of weather that we never did get to reschedule," Sander said. "Going into districts we knew Milan had a very good team and were the ones to beat. I'm pleased with our team. There were a lot of positives and we had a good year."

Weber, who told ET his extreme statements came from the heart, has said that he's in love with three women on his show -- finalists Madison, Victoria F. and Hannah Ann.


  "I've always been a firm believer that the heart wants what it wants, and I think this experience for sure has shown me that there's not just one soulmate out there," Weber told ET at the _Women Tell All_ taping on Feb. 21. The special aired on Monday night. "I think at some point in my life, I used to think that, and I've definitely been able to give my heart to more than one person. So, it's possible," he added.


  After nearly two decades with _The Bachelor_ franchise, Harrison agreed that it is possible to fall in love with three people at the same time. "I know it sounds crazy but it absolutely can happen on our show. It's an extraordinary situation where you can compartmentalize these relationships. I know it's bizarre, because none of us have this in our real lives -- you shouldn't -- [but] it's real, it can happen. I see it all the time," he said.


  But the point of _The Bachelor_ is for one man to end up with one woman... so Weber still has a journey ahead of him.


  "I could tell he was struggling early on because he had this propensity to kick the can down the road, so to speak, and he had a really tough time making decisions," Harrison shared. "I know we've given him a hard time, but those rose ceremonies, those decisions, were tough. So, when we got to the end, I knew this was going to be difficult."


  "He's so emotional, and not only does he not want to hurt anybody -- which is a normal human condition -- but he wanted to make the right decision and he was really struggling, because as you can tell, he really was falling for three women," he added.


   _The Bachelor_ concludes next Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. ET's Lauren Zima will be recapping everything that goes down, directly after the episodes. Watch ET Live on your Roku, Apple TV or Amazon Fire TV or you can stream on Pluto TV and Samsung TV Plus.

Nolin, 51, seeks that kind of “owner-operator” passion from the executives of the companies in his fund. He invests in businesses still run by their founders, or at least where executives behave like founders—those who think long-term and have significant insider ownership. “Most of corporate America is not run that way,” he says. “Especially, mid-cap and large-cap companies are run by what we call cash-paid-for CEOs: people who don’t have a large ownership stake and are mostly paid employees. At such companies there is a strong pressure from Wall Street to get results immediately.” Such short- termism leads to executive decisions “that aren’t good for the business, but good for the CEO” who is seeking a quarterly bonus.
