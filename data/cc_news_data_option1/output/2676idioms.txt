Located on Beatties Ford Road, the Excelsior Club has been a landmark in Charlotte’s Black community since the 1940s. For decades, it was one of the leading social clubs for African Americans in the Southeast, regularly hosting political leaders and entertainers. It closed in 2016 and had fallen into such disrepair that the property was named one of 11 most endangered places last year by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

Judy Antoinette Womack Holmes, a native of Baton Rouge, LA and resident of North Richland Hills, TX, passed away on July 1, 2020, at the age of 73. Judy worked as an early elementary educator for 35 years teaching first and second grade in the Louisiana Public School system. She adored children and cherished her years as a teacher. She was a special person with a heart of gold and loved all who were in her presence. Everywhere Judy went, she met a friend. She often said in jest how she could talk to a wall. She was an avid coffee drinker and collector of porcelain dolls. She had an affinity of jewelry and antique furniture. She enjoyed watching old movies, traveling and delighted in the fact she had visited all 50 of the United States. She loved her sons fearlessly, and raised them alone for many years after their father passed. She was very proud of the men they became and the families they raised. She loved her son's spouses as true daughters and her six grandchildren with all her heart. Judy was happy in her last years to become a resident of Texas and be near her younger son's children. She is a breast cancer survivor of 14 years and was proud to be in such company. She is survived by two sons, Gary Landon Holmes, a Biology teacher, and wife, Christie Holmes; Greg Womack Holmes, a Nurse Anesthetist, and wife, Laurie Holmes; six grandchildren whom she loved endlessly; and numerous other family members. She is preceded in death by her husband of 19 years, Gary Lee Holmes; and parents, Morris and Janelle Womack.

United Airlines will send layoff warnings to 36,000 employees - nearly half its U.S. staff - in the clearest signal yet of how deeply the virus outbreak is hurting the airline industry. United officials said Wednesday, July 8 that they still hope to limit the number of layoffs by offering early retirement, but they have to send notices this month to comply with a law requiring that workers get 60 days' notice ahead of mass job cuts.

For example, Qinghai Province in China aims to achieve 100% green energy consumption and supply in the long term. Together with Huawei, the province has leveraged cloud computing to construct a new energy data center powered by AI and big data capabilities. Now, the provincial electric power company can predict the renewable energy yield simply based on the weather forecast. With multi-energy compensation, the total power output to access the grid will be more stable. By implementing these high-tech strategies, in 2019, Qinghai maintained 100% green energy generation for 15 consecutive days. In this case, clean energy consumption has been supported through digital and smart means.

When the subject of novels by C.S. Forester pops up at cocktail parties, film adaptations of them that immediately come to mind are "The African Queen" (script by James Agee and John Huston) and "Sink the Bismark!" (script by Edmund H. North). I wasn't familiar with Forester's 1955 book "The Good Shepherd," another one about both a world war and sailing vessels.      Neither was Tom Hanks, who picked up a copy of it seven or eight years ago because he liked the cover, fell under its spell, and eventually turned it into a screenplay that has become the film "Greyhound."      Though not based on any specific WWII incident, the story easily could have happened. After the film's brief introduction via quotes from Winston Churchill - "The brunt of the war has fallen upon the sailor men," and Franklin Roosevelt - "Our American merchant ships must be free," the circumstances are presented.      The time is February 1942. The place is the North Atlantic. The backdrop is a convoy of 37 troop and supply ships headed from the U.S. to Liverpool, led by the heavily armed destroyer Greyhound. Their safe passage is guaranteed only for the first and last parts of the crossing, when they would be protected from German U-boat (submarine) attack by American, and later British, air support. Due to fuel limitations, the planes weren't able to assist mid-ocean, in the area that became known as "The Black Pit."      It's at the entrance to "The Black Pit" that we meet Captain Ernie Krause (Tom Hanks) who has just been given his first command of Greyhound, a gray ship on a gray ocean, at that point about 50 hours away from British air cover.      Right away, this becomes the story of Kraus as well as the story of dangers on a war-torn sea. A brief flashback reveals that Kraus has a fiancee (Elisabeth Shue) and that he's been waiting a long time for this sort of assignment. When the setting returns to Greyhound, it's established that Krause is a serious officer who knows what he's expected to do and intends to do it well. It's also made clear that he doesn't sleep well on ships.      But there's no time for him to think about sleep or, it turns out, food, because the war leaps out at him, and his crew, and the ships Greyhound is escorting. A blip on a radar screen translates into a report of a possible U-boat. "We'll run it down," he says. But by the time he finishes that thought, the cinematic tension has begun, with quick editing cuts and welling music. Assisted by his right-hand man, Charlie Cole (Stephen Graham), and his crack team of young sailors, he oversees the anxious situation: A U-boat gets closer, surfaces for air, gets even closer, disappears, is picked up on sonar, and is destroyed. "Fifty less Krauts," says one sailor. "Fifty souls," mutters the captain, who is also shown to be a pious man.      There are more blips on screens, more fear of attacks from below. There are aerial views that show the convoy, appearing to be made up of tiny ships, on the vast ocean. But the cameras keep returning to the claustrophobic atmosphere of Greyhound, and to what shifts from a look of determination to one of uncertainty on the face of Krause. He still hasn't slept, the ship's cook, Cleveland (Rob Morgan), can't convince him to eat, and one, then another, then yet another of the merchant ships are hit by torpedoes.      The captain's work is never done. Questions are asked, perils arise, decisions are made, orders are shouted. "Full right rudder!" and other jargon becomes commonplace dialogue. Multiple blips appear on screens, but no one is really sure how many U-boats are out there.      Emotions of characters and viewers are put on edge, guns are fired, torpedoes are launched, chaos reigns. To make matters worse, an English-speaking German- accented voice is repeatedly radioed all over Greyhound, saying, "We hunt you and your friends!"      This is a nail-biting movie that's anchored by a terrific internal performance from Hanks, whose character isn't afraid to doubt his own decisions, and is played out with uncomfortable but mesmerizing realism. In the end, it nabs a spot in the genre of triumph of the spirit films.      "Greyhound" premieres on Apple TV+ on July 10.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Greyhound"   Written by Tom Hanks; directed by Aaron Schneider   With Tom Hanks, Stephen Graham, Rob Morgan, Elisabeth Shue   Rated PG-13

Joseph Como, 77 Former Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court of New York, Richmond County Joseph Como, beloved husband, father, brother, uncle, colleague and friend, passed away July 2, 2020 at the age of 77, after a brief illness. Joe served as Chief Clerk of the Supreme Court of New York, Richmond County, for over 10 years, retiring in 2015. His career in the courts spanned decades, including service in Manhattan and Brooklyn as well as Staten Island. Joe was born in Brooklyn and lived his entire adult life in New York City, apart from his time in the U.S. Army in Southeast Asia in 1968-69. He moved to Staten Island in 1978. An avid cyclist and longtime member of the Staten Island Bicycling Association, Joe was on his bike every day, rain or shine, summer or winter. While still working, he rode on long tours, biking across New York State and from Georgia to Maine, and after his retirement, cycled the length of the famed Route 66 and traveled by bike through the jungles and Andes Mountains in Peru. Joe was also a lover of opera and all kinds of music, and a lifelong NY Giants fan. He was a man of many interests, and could speak knowledgeably about countless topics, from history, literature and sports to political and current affairs among others. Joe is survived by his wife Jean, son David and daughter-in-law Karen, brother Leo Como and wife Donna, sister Angela Drozdoff and husband Matthew, brother-in-law Jack Langton and sister- in-law Patricia Brett as well as nieces and nephews Trepany, Jonah, Jesse and Peter Como; Laura (Como) Geertgens; Leo and Matthew Drozdoff; Anna (Drozdoff) Herbert; and many great-nieces and nephews. He was predeceased by his youngest sister, Mary Langton, who died in 2018. Joe's generosity, kindness, strength, and wisdom will be sorely missed and forever remembered by his family and friends. A private family service was held on July 7th, and a memorial celebration of his life may be planned for a future date. In lieu of flowers, contributions in his name may be made to the Mount Sinai Health System (Manhattan) or to the American Cancer Society.

(AP) - United Airlines will send layoff warnings to 36,000 employees - nearly half its U.S. staff - in the clearest signal yet of how deeply the virus outbreak is hurting the airline industry.The outlook for a recovery in air travel has dimmed in just the past two weeks, as infection rates rise in much of the U.S. and some states imposed new quarantine requirements.United officials said Wednesday that they still hope to limit the number of October layoffs by offering early retirement, and that the 36,000 number is a worst case scenario. The notices being sent to employees this month are meant to comply with 60-day warning ahead of mass job cuts.The furloughs would include 15,000 flight attendants, 11,000 customer service and gate agents, 5,500 maintenance workers and 2,250 pilots."The United Airlines projected furlough numbers are a gut punch, but they are also the most honest assessment we've seen on the state of the industry," said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. "This crisis dwarfs all others in aviation history, and there's no end in sight."If United carries through on the notices, furloughs would take effect on or shortly after Oct. 1. United can't lay off workers before then as a condition of the $5 billion in federal payroll aid it began receiving this spring.The flight attendants' union and other airline labor groups are lobbying Congress to approve another $25 billion in payroll aid to protect jobs through next March. But a senior United executive expressed doubt that Congress would approve the spending in an election year."We do not feel like we can count on additional government support to survive," said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.United executives said the notices covered 45% of the airline's U.S. staff. Another 1,300 management and support staff will be laid off Oct. 1, the company said. Including international employees, United has a work force of about 95,000.Air travel plunged about 95% from March 1 until mid-April, then began a slow recovery. The number of U.S. air travelers around the July 4 weekend was the highest since mid-March, but was still down about 70% from a year ago.In recent weeks, the number of new reported cases of COVID-19 has roughly doubled to about 50,000 a day. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Chicago have announced that people arriving from states with high infection rates will have to quarantine, throwing up a new roadblock to travel.United's traffic at its hub in Newark, New Jersey, has slumped more deeply than the rest of its network since those quarantine rules were announced.Executives of other airlines have predicted their companies will be much smaller, with fewer employees, in October. Delta Air Lines recently told employees that it will send layoff notices to more than 2,500 of its 14,000 pilots.___David Koenig can be reached at www.twitter.com/airlinewriterCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

"It's not a matter of if schools should open," Education Secretary Betsy DeVos declared at the White House coronavirus task force briefing on Wednesday. "It's simply a matter of how."
 The CDC released guidance agreeing that in-person learning is imperative, but added that, for the time being, with new spikes in coronavirus cases in several states, distance learning is still the safest option. President Trump pushed back at the CDC's narrative, urging schools to be back in business this fall. He even threatened to withhold funds from districts who don't allow students to return. One of those regions may be New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio just announced that he won't be mandating normal school schedules this fall.
 DeVos used Fairfax County, Virginia as an example of what a "disaster" a virtual education can be for students. The school district recently offered parents the option to keep their kids home, or to send them to school for just a few days a week.
 "They offered families a so-called choice for this fall: either zero days in schools for their students or two days," she said. "And their springtime attempt at distant learning was a disaster. This cannot happen again in the fall."
 Fairfax GOP agreed with the secretary.
 "If #FCPS won't offer five days a week of instruction this fall, then parents should have the right to use their educational tax dollars elsewhere," said Fairfax County GOP Chairman Steve Knotts.
 Fairfax County teacher unions take a different approach, explaining at a town hall last month that they miss the kids, but they want to "feel safe at work."
 "I don't want to leave teaching, but I want to feel safe at work," said librarian Tiffany Dowling. "Now we are being asked to make a hasty decision for our children and ourselves with so few answers."
