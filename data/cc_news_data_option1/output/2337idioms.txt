The Ontario Federation of Agriculture president praised the provincial government for committing up to $15 million to improve workers' health and safety on farms and in food-processing facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Keith Currie said Friday's expansion of the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program will help farmers recoup some of the extra money they've spent on personal protective equipment (PPE) and workplace modifications.
 "It's more opportunities for our members to take advantage of health and safety things that are out there to further the cause, to lessen the contact points between employees," he said. "I think it's a very positive announcement."
 The cost-share funding expansion more than triples the previous investment of $4.5 million by the governments of Ontario and Canada under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership program.
 Ontario farmers are spending thousands of extra dollars per worker during the pandemic, Currie said.
 Some of the money is for PPE, such as masks, shields and aprons, he said. Some is for charter flights bringing migrant workers from their home countries, and some is for paying those workers' salaries during the mandatory 14-day quarantine after they arrive but aren't allowed to work.
 "I'm hearing estimates anywhere between $3,000 and $4,000 per worker over and above normal expenses," Currie said. "That's just general talk what the cost is. Certainly it's an additional burden. If you have a hundred workers, that's a lot of money."
 The safety of farm employees, especially migrant workers, is a growing concern during the ongoing crisis.
 Chatham-Kent's biggest outbreak of COVID-19 was at Greenhill Produce, a Kent Bridge greenhouse operation where 103 workers tested positive. Nearly all were migrant workers. In nearby Norfolk County, more than 160 workers at Scotlynn Group were infected with the virus.
 Two migrant workers have died of coronavirus in Essex County, where there are more than 200 confirmed cases in the agricultural sector.
 Joe Sbrocchi, general manager of the Ontario Greenhouse Vegetable Growers, said the provincial government's funding announcement is welcome news to farmers doing their best to keep employees safe.
 "Our members began to protect our workers more than two months ago which necessitated us bringing in supplies which were scarce at the time, from overseas, to outfit our members," Sbrocchi said. "We also made some of these supplies available to those communities in which we serve.
 "Our costs related to protecting our workforce from the COVID spread is - and will continue to be - quite large."
 Having more PPE available to workers means they can also be better protected if they leave the farm, he said.
 "Currently we discourage our guest workers from going out and about, but if they must for some rare reason, these PPE should be a part of everything they do," Sbrocchi said. "This holds true for our Canadian workers as well.
 "We have received good remarks for our members' handling of the COVID challenges thus far from the local health units, yet they have repeatedly related that the transmission comes from the community back into the on-farm population. Now we must turn our attention to what happens when our employees, Canadian or otherwise, go out into the general community as well."

A German neo-Nazi stands trial Tuesday on charges of murdering pro-refugee politician Walter Luebcke, in a case that shocked the country and highlighted the growing threat of right-wing extremism.Federal prosecutors believe the main suspect, 46-year-old Stephan Ernst, was motivated by "racism and xenophobia" when he allegedly drove to Luebcke's house on June 1, 2019 and shot him in the head.Ernst is to appear before the higher regional court in Frankfurt alongside co-defendant Markus H. who is accused of helping Ernst train with firearms -- including the murder weapon.The killing has been described as Germany's first far-right political assassination since World War II.The trial is expected to draw huge interest but seating in the courtroom will be limited because of coronavirus social distancing measures.Luebcke's wife and two adult sons plan to attend the opening hearing."Hatred and violence can have no place in our society," they said in a statement. "All of us who stand for a free democracy must not fall silent, but take a clear position."\- Pro-refugee speech -Luebcke, 65, belonged to Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative CDU party and headed the Kassel regional council in the western state of Hesse.He supported Merkel's 2015 decision to open the country's borders to refugees during Europe's migrant crisis and spoke in favour of hosting asylum seekers in a local town.Prosecutors believe Ernst and his accomplice attended a speech by Luebcke in October 2015 when the politician defended helping refugees and said anyone who didn't agree with those values was "free to leave the country".AFPStephan E., supected of killing the administrative chief of the western city of Kassel Walter Luebcke, is escorted by police back to a helicopter after a hearing at the Federal Court of Justice in Karlsruhe, southern GermanyThe remark was widely shared online and sparked a furious reaction from people on the far right.After the speech, Ernst "increasingly projected his hatred of foreigners" onto Luebcke, prosecutors said in the indictment.Following mass sexual assaults by migrants against women in Cologne on New Year's Eve 2015 and a 2016 Islamist attack in the French city of Nice, Ernst allegedly began tracking Luebcke's movements.Between 2016 and 2018, prosecutors say he worked with Markus H. to improve his skill with firearms, and the two are said to have attended right- wing demonstrations together.In the course of their investigations, prosecutors separately charged Ernst with attempted murder for allegedly stabbing an Iraqi asylum seeker in the back in 2016.They also uncovered a cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to Ernst, including revolvers, pistols and a submachine gun. Although Ernst initially admitted to killing Luebcke, he later retracted his confession and said Markus H. had pulled the trigger.But prosecutors maintain that while the accomplice "accepted and supported" the danger Ernst posed, he was not aware of concrete plans for an attack.- 'Biggest threat' -In 1993, Ernst was convicted for an attempted bomb attack on an asylum home. In 2009, German media say he also took part in neo- Nazi clashes targeting a union demonstration.But Ernst then slipped off the security services' radar, fuelling criticism that German authorities weren't taking the far-right threat seriously enough.German police came under fire years earlier for overlooking racist crimes after it emerged that a neo-Nazi terror cell, the National Socialist Underground, had killed 10 people, mainly immigrants, between 2000 in 2007.Luebcke's killing was followed by a shooting at a synagogue in Halle, eastern Germany, that left two dead in October 2019, while another gunman shot dead nine people of migrant origin in the central town of Hanau in February this year.Several politicians have reported receiving far-right death threats in recent months, including Germany's only black MP Karamba Diaby. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has since declared far-right extremism the "biggest security threat facing Germany".He has promised tougher security measures, including a crackdown on online hate speech.

That’s an issue because prairies are powerhouses for environmental health, he said. While forests are considered beneficial to the environment based on the carbon dioxide they remove and the habitats they provide for wildlife, prairies do even more of that, Huebner said — releasing more oxygen and protecting more creatures.
 One example: pollinators. The bee balm plants he’s monitoring are excellent at drawing pollinators such as bees, which help nearby fruit and nut crops. Huebner the 8-acre property near 18th and Texas included about 3/4 acre of a remnant prairie. On that remnant recently he found a rare specimen.
 “A native species of bee was found on that remnant,” Huebner said. “It might be found farther west, but it’s not been found in the state of Missouri until now. It shows how important these are.”
 Additionally, prairies retain much more water, preventing surges in waterways after storms.
 Joplin prairies
 Huebner has been working on that particular property for about six or seven years, he said. After the tornado, it was in bad shape — “just a mess of trees,” he said.
 With funding from a mining settlement, the foundation entered into a partnership with the city of Joplin’s parks department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to convert the land. Workers cleared and mulched the trees, performed prescribed burns and eliminated invasive species.
 This is the first year where the prairie looks pretty nice, he said. The foundation is continuing to work on building a trail with signage for walking or hiking.
 As for his outreach to the community, he works with farmers to keep prairies intact. Fortunately, that’s not difficult to do, he said.
 “The biggest threat has been the plow,” Huebner said. “Row crops are the No. 1 threat. Prairies can be grazed, depending on the level of grazing and what your goals are. They can also be hayed somewhat annually. But once you start tilling the soil, that’s when it gets dangerous for it.”
 The foundation is funded from the mining settlement, federal grants and private donations. Huebner and the foundation will continue to maintain similar prairies around the area, including properties in Joplin, Diamond, Sarcoxie and elsewhere. Also, events such as dove hunts are planned for the future.
 All for a type of land that can be a workhorse for the environment, he said.
 “When we had all those prairies, it largely supported wildlife, including everything Native Americans hunted. That’s why resources were so abundant,” he said. “We’ve lost that over the years.”

 Trusten W. Polk was born on May 29, 1811, in Delaware where he received his early education before attending Cambridge Academy in Maryland and Yale in Connecticut. His wish was to go into the ministry, but at his father's request, he went into law.
 Polk moved to St. Louis in 1835 where he began a successful law practice. On Dec. 26, 1837, he and Elizabeth Skinner were married, and their union was blessed with five children.
 Taking an active interest in education, Polk joined Henry S. Geyer in supporting the establishment of a state university. He also helped with the creation of the Missouri Medical College in St. Louis.
 Polk served as city counselor for St. Louis until poor health forced him to resign. He recuperated by taking a long trip through Cuba, the eastern US, and Canada. His selection as a delegate to the Missouri Constitutional Convention brought him back to Missouri in 1845. Chairing the Committee on Education, he fought for state support for free public schools.
 In 1856, he was elected Missouri's 12th governor and was sworn-in Jan. 5, 1857. Barely a week later, the General Assembly chose him to succeed Geyer in the U.S. Senate. Polk resigned as governor Feb. 27 and took his seat in the U.S. Senate on March 4, 1857.
 Polk's pro-slavery feelings were well known. The Senate expelled him and Missouri's other senator, Waldo P. Johnson, in January 1862 on grounds of disloyalty and engaging in rebellion against the U.S. government.
 During the Civil War, Polk served as a colonel in the Missouri State Guard under Confederate General Sterling Price and later as a judge in the military courts of the Department of Mississippi in 1864 and 1865.
 After the war, and after the U.S. Supreme Court declared the Missouri test oath for lawyers was unconstitutional, Polk returned to St. Louis and resumed his law practice.
 He died in St. Louis on April 16, 1876, and was laid to rest there in Bellefontaine Cemetery.

Hello, dear readers, and thank you for joining us for the continuation of our monthly letters column. We received so many questions related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 that we needed to address them.
   
 • A reader from Great Barrington, Massachusetts, asked if water temperature plays a role in killing the virus when we wash our hands. "I have been diligently washing my hands, but sometimes I don't wait for the water to come out hot," he wrote. "Does washing with cold water and soap kill the germs, or does the water have to be hot?"
   
 The answer is that the water you wash your hands with can be any temperature at all. Although warm water may be more comfortable, it's the properties of the soap -- not the water temperature -- that breach the outer coating of the virus and kill it.
   
 • Along those same lines, a reader from Santa Rosa, California, urged people to consider turning off the tap during the 20 seconds they are lathering up. "Hand washing is critical for health now, but water conservation never fails to be significant," she wrote.
   
 • A reader from Arkansas asked if using the microwave is a good way to destroy virus particles on surfaces. "I feel that the best way for the virus to invade my home in this rural and isolated area of Arkansas is through the mail and newspaper, and I have been running them through the microwave for 30 seconds," he wrote. "Is the microwave killing the virus?"
   
 A microwave oven works by exciting the water molecules in a food or beverage, which raises its temperature. The actual radiation doesn't have a direct effect. Since viral particles are made up of proteins and fats, the microwave will not destroy them.
   
 However, the most recent research shows that the major source of transmission of the novel coronavirus is through respiratory droplets, which are emitted while breathing, sneezing, coughing, speaking or laughing. And while viral particles have been found to persist on paper for up to 24 hours and on plastic for up to three days, the risk is quite low. There are no documented cases of that kind of transmission. If you're still worried, you can use hand- washing or gloves to protect yourself until 24 hours have passed.
   
 • A reader from Indiana, who, like so many of us, is running low on hand sanitizer, asked about going DIY. "Will the homemade wipes be as effective in killing germs as the prepackaged brands?" she wrote. As long as the alcohol content in your formula is at least 60%, the minimum needed to kill most germs, your home brew will be effective. The only way to achieve this is by using isopropyl or rubbing alcohol that is 99% alcohol volume. Be sure to rub all hand sanitizers into your hands until they are completely dry, from 30 to 60 seconds.
   
 Thank you again to all of our readers for your kind thoughts and well wishes. We hope you and your families stay safe and well.

Automating your processes can also help scale your business. Let's use a business that prints t-shirts as an example. Printing t-shirts per order is a great place to start when the orders are coming in slowly. However, if there's a rush of new customers, then you'd have to hire more people to manually print the shirts (growth). If you invest in an automated t-shirt printing press, after setting up the design, the machine runs around the clock to fill the order. Thus, you have scaled the business without increasing your cost.

After a respite for nearly two weeks, the maximum temperature in north India started to rise again with parts of Rajasthan experiencing a heatwave-like condition.
 In Bikaner, the temperature soared to 46.2 degrees Celsius on Monday, followed by Barmer, Ganganagar and Jaisalmer at 45.3, 45.0 and 46.2 degrees respectively. News agency PTI reported that forecast agencies have predicted slow advancement of monsoon this week.
 The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light rain in some places in the state but the heatwave is likely to prevail for at least the next 24 hours.
 On Monday, Delhi experienced a maximum temperature of 41.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and it is likely to remain above 40 degrees Celsius for the next three days before light rains bring some relief.
 In Punjab and Haryana, too, the day temperatures were above normal. Hisar in Haryana was the hottest place in the two states at 42.9 degrees Celsius, recording a two-degree increase above the normal.
 The Southwest Monsoon, which arrived in Kerala on its usual date on June 1, moved ahead because of a deep depression in the Arabian Sea which later turned into Cyclone Nisarga and hit the Maharashtra coast on June 3.
 It has now covered whole of Maharashtra and parts of Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.
 In fact, isolated areas in the suburbs of Mumbai in Maharashtra recorded moderate to heavy showers on Monday allowing the city to achieve 50 per cent of its average rainfall for the month of June.
 The weather bureau on Monday afternoon revised its orange alert for the city (heavy to very heavy rain) to a yellow alert (moderate to heavy rain) and has issued an orange alert for Tuesday and Wednesday.
 The monsoon has, meanwhile, further advanced to Kandla, Ahmedabad, Indore, Narsinghpur, Umaria and Balia, the IMD update at 8 am on Tuesday said. Rains are expected to continue in Gujarat, Diu, some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Sikkim under the influence of East-West trough.

 The decision was made after the assistant health director, Ryan Talken, said he believes Joplin is not just seeing an increase in cases because of more testing.
 Councilman Gary Shaw asked if the percentage of increase is consistent with the increase in testing.
 "I'm conflicted because I see the need to be safe," he said, but also the governor is opening the state today and businesses here will want to fully open.
 Talken said looking at the numbers since May 1 the city is seeing a higher percentage of positives from the tests.
 "We're getting more positives on roughly the same amount of tests run."
 "Do you feel this a spike?" Shaw asked. He said Health Director Dan Pekarek had previously said the city did not want to see a spike in cases because the spread of the virus could then become uncontrollable.
 "Yes, I'm looking at a spike," Talken said. "We are climbing. As far as not being able to control it, that's a different statement. I think we can. I think if people come back and everybody gets on board again, I think we can flatten it."
 Asked by Shaw if his recommendation was to stay on the recovery plan for the next two weeks, Talken said that it is his recommendation.

I think our cat Max has somehow gotten in cahoots with a bird to get me up in the morning for his breakfast. Every morning at around 5 a.m., just as the first pale gray veil of dawn is lifted in the early morning deep silence as the day is becoming conscious of itself, a robin in the dogwood tree just outside our bedroom window tree trills one loud “cheerio” (I think he may have been a rooster in a former life), setting off the avian dawn chorus, startling Max into action — and causing me to pull the sheet over my head in a feeble attempt at just one more hour of sleep.
 Not for long though. As the cacophony of birdsong rises and fragrances of summer morning drift through the open window, the tickle of cat whiskers and a sharp tug on my hair set me on my feet to take care of feline hunger pangs I know will not let up until breakfast is served. I can’t claim to be an early morning person, at least not all the time, but I do love soft, warm summer mornings in the quiet house, with my first fragrant cup of coffee sipped sitting barefoot on the deck to savor the beginnings of the day before anyone else is awake.
 With a second cup of coffee, the garden crooks a leafy finger, beckoning me down the brick path past my studio to open the greenhouse door. I pause for a moment under the potted brugmansia tree, its pink trumpet blooms dangling chandelierlike overhead, before I continue through the woods to check for results of any misadventures night-roaming critters might have wrought. Liquid Fence repellent sprayed on hostas and lilies seems to be working, so far, as Agnes has been keeping outside the fence since we spoiled her salad bar with a dressing she doesn’t like. But she is still fearless — cocking her head and wagging her tail doglike when I speak to her, defiant and standing her ground. There are no fawns to show off yet, but in a couple more weeks I’m sure they will be bouncing at mom’s side with her same sassy attitude.

SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) — Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is expected to plead guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter during a court hearing in which the nation's largest utility will be confronted with its history of neglect and greed that culminated in a wildfire that wiped out most of a Northern California town.The Tuesday hearing before Butte County Superior Court Judge Michael Deems comes nearly three months after PG&amp;E reached a plea agreement in the November 2018 Camp Fire that was ignited by its rickety electrical grid that destroyed Paradise, about 170 miles (275 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco. The fire killed 85 people, but prosecutors weren't certain they could prove PG&amp;E was responsible for one of the deaths.The spectacle will unfold as PG&amp;E approaches the end of a complicated bankruptcy case that the company used to work out $25.5 billion in settlements to pay for the damages from the Camp Fire and others that torched wide swaths of Northern California and killed dozens of others in 2017. The bankruptcy deals include $13.5 billion earmarked for wildfire victims. A federal judge plans to approve or reject PG&amp;E's plan for getting out of bankruptcy by June 30.“We want this to be impactful because this can't go on any longer," Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey told The Associated Press. “There is going to have to be a sea change in PG&amp;E's method of operation."The hearing will start with a recitation of each felony count while the pictures of all the people who died in the 2018 fire are shown on a large screen set up in the courtroom, according to Ramsey.The proceedings will continue Wednesday when surviving family members of those who died in the 2018 wildfire will be allowed to make statements before Deems. More than 20 of the family members plan to appear in the court while others have sent in statements that Ramsey plans to read aloud. Deems will formally sentence PG&amp;E on Thursday or Friday, according to Ramsey.The drama will be streamed online.Besides the mass killings, PG&amp;E also will plead to one felony count of unlawfully causing a fire. No executives will be charged, leaving no one to imprison for the crimes. PG&amp;E instead will pay a maximum fine of $3.5 million in addition to $500,000 to cover the county's costs of the criminal investigation.The plea agreement also spares PG&amp;E from being placed on criminal probation for a second time. The company is in the midst of a five- year probation under the withering supervision of U.S. District Judge William Alsup for a 2010 explosion in its natural gas lines that blew up a neighborhood in San Bruno and killed eight people. The probation lasts until January 2022.Since filing for bankruptcy early last year, PG&amp;E says it already has been dramatically altering a corporate culture that prioritized profits for its shareholders over the safety of the 16 million people who rely on the utility for power.The company is being more vigilant about trimming trees around its power lines and replacing outdated equipment before it crumbles, although Alsup has repeatedly scolded PG&amp;E for not doing even more to ensure its grid doesn't cause more tragedy. As part of a deal with California power regulators, PG&amp;E will replace 11 of its 14 board members. CEO Bill Johnson will step down June 30.Despite PG&amp;E’s pledge to turn over a new leaf, the utility’s critics fear more danger looms during an upcoming wildfire season after an unusually dry winter in Northern California.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Joplin will stay the course on the city's COVID-19 recovery plan, the City Council agreed on Monday night.
 After hearing a recommendation from the assistant director of the Joplin Health Department that the city not abandon restrictions in the plan, the council voted 9-0 on a motion by Councilman Doug Lawson.
 "I am one that has resisted any shutdown" in the beginning, Lawson said. After going around feeling it had not affected him and then seeing the jump in numbers the last two weeks, "my suggestion is we continue (staying on the plan) at least until the next meeting," he said. He made a motion to that effect that was seconded by Councilwoman Diane Reid-Adams.

Tim Taylor of Bunceton wants to be the next state representative for the Missouri's 48th district. He started campaigning in January.
   
 He will face off on the Republican ticket against Cooper County Presiding Commissioner Don Baragary, who recently took an 11-day ride to meet constituents with a focus on patriotism, in the August primary.
   
 Taylor credits his influences to running for state office from his parents and his childhood and teenage years in the Boonville School District.
   
 "We had some really quality and good teachers in the Boonville School District the years I went through school," he said. "They all instilled a sense of responsibility to us to keep this government going, that we all should do our part."
   
 This sense of duty also led Taylor to serve in the U.S. Air Force from 1987 to 1991. He served during the the first Gulf War. He always has worked as a fire fighter in some capacity, whether it was volunteering in Boonville or working in Columbia, up until his retirement from the Columbia department April 2019. He also spent some time working for Kerry Bramon Remodeling and Design in Columbia in the early to mid-1990s.
   
 When working for the Columbia department, he climbed up the ranks, eventually becoming a captain. Other leadership roles were Cooper County Youth Fair Board president and vice chair of the Cooper County University Extension Council.
   
 While there are similarities between Taylor and Baragary, Taylor feels that his working to serve the public his entire adult life sets him apart. Baragary has served as the presiding commissioner for five years.
   
 "I feel the urge to continue that," he said. "I think the public service is going to separate the two of us."
   
 If Taylor wins the nomination and ultimately the seat, his first steps would be to get a handle on the ins-and-outs of state government. He wants to be in a position to find ways to protect small businesses.
   
 "If we have a rebound of COVID-19, [we need] to really evaluate and be sure we are making the right decisions at the state level," he said.
   
 He also is passionate about ensuring second amendment rights are not infringed, which also is a constituent concern, he said. He has concerns about cuts to the state budget, especially education.
   
 "That is probably going to be wrapped up before I have a chance to get in, but education is going to need to be looked at," he said. "We need to ensure we find the funding to keep it going."
   
 Campaigning for the position is interesting, Taylor said. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic canceling most in-person events, his campaign has turned to social media to get his message out to district residents.
   
 "I wish I was more adept at social media, but we learn something new every day," he said. "Things are starting to open up and we are going around to talk to people. People are really in search of conversation, human interaction."

The chants that started in metropolises are echoing back from the countryside.
 From cities such as Stratford, Woodstock and Sarnia to smaller communities such as Ingersoll, Tillsonburg, and Kincardine and into more rural areas, Black Lives Matter protests have popped up across Southwestern Ontario.
 It's a clear message that the Black Lives Matter movement -- and a demand to end anti-Black racism -- transcends geography and the rural-urban divide.
 "I think it matters more, especially in smaller towns," said Hannah Hodder, founder of the Oxford County chapter of Black Lives Matter.
 "Compared to the U.S., I think Canada has a better way of concealing these kinds of issues. They're not so much in your face compared to the states," the 19-year-old said.
 "Especially for smaller communities, it's not alarming, but it's concerning. The level of racism is super concealed. You're not sure whether there are people who are racist or closeted racists. It's harder to go about these kinds of matters."
 While Woodstock is her hometown, Hodder opted to create the chapter to include all of Oxford County, one of few rural chapters.
 "I feel like it's important to include all the rural towns and areas," she said.
 Hodder created a Facebook page and organized a protest in Woodstock as hundreds of demonstrations continued throughout the world, sparked by the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minneapolis after white police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds.
 Aside from the protest, Hodder aims to bring resources to the community and said the first step for individuals seeking to combat racism against Black, Indigenous and other people of colour starts with education.
 "It's important that as a community, we continue to engage people, teach them, educate them on what it means to be anti-racist," she said. "There is a lot of room for growing and change."
 She says that individual growth can start with something as simple as watching a documentary, consuming media by Black creators and seeking out resources on how to support anti-racism.
 Her chapter plans to release a list of demands for local officials in the coming days, which will provide ways to tackle systemic racism in the community.
 Eventually, Hodder hopes to have representatives from other rural towns in Oxford County assisting with the chapter.
 In the meantime, rural protests and demonstrations -- from town-square rallies of 30 in Simcoe to marches of hundreds in Chatham-Kent -- raise awareness in predominantly white, conservative communities that may seem far removed from the movement's epicentres.
 "When I see those rural populations, which is something I see now more than ever before, saying, 'This is wrong, I'm going to stand up and be an ally,' that makes me feel good," said Myrna Lashley, a psychiatry professor at McGill University who researches culture and mental health.
 "I hope that we as human beings have empathy for other human beings, regardless of the size of the population in which we reside."
 Rural communities might be more engaged with the current anti-racism movement because they have greater access to information than before, Lashley said. They can see exactly what is happening in the world, no longer cut off in isolated bubbles.
 "We're all starting to understand now that we've all been working under the boot of colonialism. That boot has kicked us all," she said.
 But as the rural-urban divide starts to close, with more individuals moving from large cities to the countryside or young small-towners who moved away for school returning home, the opportunity arises to learn from the experiences in multicultural centres.
 "I think it is good when people are exposed to other nationalities, when they are exposed to other people," she said. "If they've been in urban centres, they certainly have a good understanding of the larger community. They can bring it back and educate others."
 Lashley said a challenge faced by people of colour living in rural communities is that often there are few others.
 "It can be very, very lonely when you're the only one," she said. "It is incumbent on those who (already live there) to make that person feel welcome, to learn about that person, to be an ally. It's incumbent on the newcomer, unfortunately, to teach them who you are."
 Part of that inclusion is protests and demonstrations -- signs that there are allies in rural communities fighting racism.
 It's representations like this Hodder wished she had growing up in Woodstock, and one she's committed to giving the next generation of Black youth in her area.
 "These protests all over Canada and the states, they're protests on basic human rights for people, especially Black individuals," Hodder said. "This isn't a trend; it's a civil rights movement."

More than 100 members of the Boonville High School Class of 2020 received diplomas Friday in a commencement ceremony that focused on celebration amid uncertainty.
   
 Originally scheduled last month, the Boonville school board opted for a June ceremony instead due to ongoing concerns over COVID-19. Students were seated apart from each other on the football field track and their entrances were spaced out as well to maintain social distancing.
   
 While the ceremony did not have as many speakers as usual, students still were able to receive some last-minute advice from English teacher Jody Goodman.
   
 "What do you need to know while I have this one last chance to give you some knowledge to take with you in your life," he said.
   
 Goodman felt honored to be the person to address the Class of 2020. He wants students to be present and engage in life so they do not miss out on any of life's opportunities.
   
 "Try and be indispensable to your employer, to your significant other, your team, your platoon, your community and, most importantly, your friends and family," he said. "Be a rock set so firmly in place that no one can kick it aside."
   
 He also wants his students to be invested in whatever they do, not matter how small the task, because that shows others how much they care.
   
 "Do it in a way that you can be proud of and so that no one can undermine your efforts," Goodman said.
   
 Students should get out of their own comfort zones to experience new ideas, which makes life more fun, he said.
   
 "You will thrive if you can do this," he said.
   
 If students remain open to new ideas, they will flourish, be remembered and recognized, he said. Using the analogy of Athens and Sparta, Goodman said one city still is thriving and recognizable because it was open to new ideas so many years ago, while the other was insular and now even is hard to find on a map.
   
 "History and geopolitics are a lot more complicated than a metaphor," he said. "My point is this, be like Athens. Be open to new ideas. It will help you become a more well-rounded person and withstand the test of time. Be clear about what you want and what you expect of others."
   
 While the last half of the school year was eventful and somewhat fearful, it will pass, Goodman said.
   
 "As a former history teacher, I know how fast America can get back to normal," he said. "You might not believe me right now, but I wish you would because it might save you some regrets later. Don't be scared to do big things."
   
 Diplomas were presented by school board president Charles Melkersman to graduates, while their end-of-year awards and scholarships were read. Closing remarks were delivered by the senior class officers.

News agency PTI reported that forecast agencies have predicted slow advancement of monsoon this week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light rain in some places in the state but the heatwave is likely to prevail for at least the next 24 hours.On Monday, Delhi experienced a maximum temperature of 41.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and it is likely to remain above 40 degrees Celsius for the next three days before light rains bring some relief.In Punjab and Haryana, too, the day temperatures were above normal. Hisar in Haryana was the hottest place in the two states at 42.9 degrees Celsius, recording a two-degree increase above the normal.The Southwest Monsoon, which arrived in Kerala on its usual date on June 1, moved ahead because of a deep depression in the Arabian Sea which later turned into Cyclone Nisarga and hit the Maharashtra coast on June 3.It has now covered whole of Maharashtra and parts of Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.In fact, isolated areas in the suburbs of Mumbai in Maharashtra recorded moderate to heavy showers on Monday allowing the city to achieve 50 per cent of its average rainfall for the month of June.The weather bureau on Monday afternoon revised its orange alert for the city (heavy to very heavy rain) to a yellow alert (moderate to heavy rain) and has issued an orange alert for Tuesday and Wednesday.The monsoon has, meanwhile, further advanced to Kandla, Ahmedabad, Indore, Narsinghpur, Umaria and Balia, the IMD update at 8 am on Tuesday said. Rains are expected to continue in Gujarat, Diu, some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Sikkim under the influence of East-West trough.
