 OTTAWA, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Canada is seeing a massive spike in COVID-19 cases which could overwhelm the hospital system, an emotional Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, imploring Canadians to stay home as much as possible.
 A second wave is ripping across the country, forcing several provinces to reimpose restrictions on movement and businesses. Cases continue to spike and authorities complain some people are being more careless about taking precautions.
 Trudeau, saying "a normal Christmas is quite frankly right out of the question", spoke shortly after Theresa Tam, chief public health officer, predicted new daily cases could soar to 60,000 by the end of the year from less than 5,000 now.
 "Cases across the country are spiking massively. We are facing winter, that's going to drive people inside more and more, and we're really at risk of seeing case loads go up and hospitals get overwhelmed," said a clearly upset Trudeau.
 "So we need to do everything we can, right now, to slow the spread of COVID-19," he told reporters, stressing the need to curb personal contacts as much as possible.
 Tam said the worst case scenario, a spike to 60,000 daily cases, would occur if people became more sociable. Even if current restrictions on gatherings are maintained, new daily cases will jump to over 20,000 by Dec 31.
 Only if people reduce their personal contacts can the situation be kept stable and even then, the experience of harder-hit European nations strongly suggests more curbs will be needed, she said.
 "Absolutely do not go above what we have now (in terms of daily cases) otherwise we are really in trouble," she said.
 Officials predict that by Nov. 30 the total death toll could be between 11,870 and 12,120, with the total cases between 366,500 and 378,600. Canada has recorded a total of 315,751 cases and 11,265 deaths so far. (Reporting by David Ljunggren and Julie Gordon Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Marguerita Choy)

The Utah Jazz stayed busy during the truncated NBA offseason, reportedly agreeing to contracts with shooting guard Jordan Clarkson and forward/center Derrick Favors on Friday.
 The team struck a four-year, $52 million deal with Clarkson, according to ESPN. Multiple outlets posted news of Favors, who previously played nine seasons in Utah, returning on a three-year, $30 million contract. Favors' contract reportedly will include a player option in the final season.
 Clarkson, 28, averaged double-figure points in each of his six NBA seasons and has been a steady scorer, mostly used off the bench throughout his career. He was acquired by Utah, his third NBA home, in a trade last December with the Cleveland Cavaliers that shipped out guard Dante Exem.
 Clarkson averaged 15.6 points per game on 46.2 percent shooting in 42 games after the Jazz acquired him, and he contributed 16.7 points per game in Utah's seven-game playoff defeat to the Denver Nuggets in the postseason -- despite Clarkson scoring a combined 50 points in a pair of early wins in the series.
 For his career, Clarkson has averaged 14.8 points per game in 453 games (140 starts) with the Los Angeles Lakers, Cavaliers and Jazz. He was originally a second-round pick by the Washington Wizards in 2014, though he spent just one day with the organization before being dealt to L.A.
 Favors, 29, spent last season with the New Orleans Pelicans, where he averaged nine points per game along with a team-best 9.8 rebounds in 51 games (49 starts).
 The 6-foot-9 Favors has averaged 11.4 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.3 blocked shots per game in his 10 NBA seasons. Originally picked by the then-New Jersey Nets with the third overall pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, Favors was dealt to Utah during his rookie year.
 Though he has never been an All-Star, Favors became a mainstay in his first Jazz stint, averaging more than 16 points in back-to-back seasons in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 seasons. A career 53 percent shooter, he sank a career- best 61.7 percent of his field-goal attempts last season with the Pelicans.

BEIRUT, Nov 21 (Reuters) - More than 60 prisoners broke out of a Lebanese jail on Saturday and five of them were killed when their car hit a tree while under pursuit, security sources and the state news agency said.
 They fled from Baabda district prison at dawn after breaking open cell doors, state news agency NNA said, adding security forces had cordoned off surrounding areas.
 Security forces told Reuters that some 69 prisoners had escaped and that eight had been caught. Five of the prisoners died after a car they seized crashed into a tree, they said.
 Authorities have launched an investigation into the jail break, NNA said.
 In April, Amnesty International said there had been riots inside Lebanese jails and families' sit-in protests calling for the release of prisoners over concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in overcrowded prisons.
 It said that while the Lebanese government had taken several measures, including some releases, the authorities should prioritise releasing prisoners who had served their sentences and expedite its review of pre-trial detainees.

The Los Angeles Lakers quickly moved on from the reported loss of backup big man Dwight Howard, agreeing to a two-year contract with NBA Sixth Man of the Year Montrezl Harrell, ESPN.com reported Friday.
 The Athletic also reported that the Lakers were close to a deal with Harrell, a standout with L.A.'s crosstown rivals, the Clippers.
 Howard has reportedly agreed to a one-year, $2.6 million deal with the Philadelphia 76ers.
 Harrell posted career highs with 18.6 points, 7.1 rebounds and 27.8 minutes per game in 63 games (two starts) before the interruption of this past season. He didn't play in any regular-season games after the resumption of play due to the death of his grandmother, after which his production slipped to 10.5 points, 2.9 rebounds and 18.7 minutes per game during the playoffs.
 Harrell, 26, was a second-round pick by Houston in 2015 and played two seasons with the Rockets before joining the Clippers as part of the June 2017 trade that sent All-Star guard Chris Paul to the Rockets.
 Through five seasons, Harrell has averaged 12.7 points and 4.9 rebounds in 318 games (25 starts).
 The acquisition of Harrell comes on the heels of the Lakers' reported trade pickup of guard Dennis Schroder from Oklahoma City. Schroder finished second in last season's Sixth Man of the Year voting.

Norman Francis Poniatowski was called to join the angels on Tuesday, November 17, 2020. He was preceded in death by his mother Carolina, father Francis, sister Joan, and great-grandson Michael. Norman's journey began the same way he lived, humbly. Born in Erie on May 23, 1941, he experienced hardship at an early age, losing his father during World War II when kamikazes attacked the USS Pringle. Norman used adversity as motivation to attain his future achievements. After serving his country in the United States Air Force, he went to work at General Electric. He started as a laborer and diligently worked his way up to Foreman and then General Foreman before becoming a Locomotive Instructor. After leaving GE, Norman went on to become a Consultant for the locomotive industry, working for numerous railroads throughout the world. His work resulted in his circumnavigation of the globe three times. But no matter how many wondrous feats he accomplished, his pride revolved around the accomplishments of his two beautiful daughters and six grandchildren, rather than his own. When he wasn't busy working, Norman was taking his children and grandchildren on cruises, trips to Disney World, and vacations to a myriad of international locations. His true joy in life was always his family. During the holidays he wanted nothing more than to enjoy being around his family, to him that was the greatest gift. Those who were fortunate enough to have their lives brightened by his shining light, knew that his larger than life, gregarious personality was matched only by his love and generosity. Many people had the pleasure of meeting the "fat man with a mustache" and have a gold coin as a memento of the encounter. And the world as a whole, is a far better place as a result of him having been a part of it. To many he was merely an affable and giving man. To his wife, a loving and compassionate husband. To his daughters, a doting and munificent father. And to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, he was the world's best Papa. Norman leaves behind his wife and best friend of 63 years, Carol, their daughters Chrisie (Greg) and Caroline (Matt), grandchildren, Jennifer (Chris), Chazzie (Darren), Christopher, Gregory, Jevon, and Garrett, and great- grandchildren Luke, Darren Jr., Mariah, Princeton, and Evangeline.

 ZURICH, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Swiss doctors have urged those vulnerable to COVID-19 complications to record their wishes for end-of-life care in advance to help ease pressure on intensive care units, drawing criticism from an advocacy group.
 Pro Senectute Schweiz, an organisation for the elderly, said the doctors' appeal was premature and excessive but medics insist such patient decrees are necessary in the heart-wrenching reality of caring for critical patients during this pandemic.
 As health systems grapple with soaring infection rates, medical professionals working with limited resources and finite space in ICUs can at times face agonising dilemmas, and ethical questions around treating COVID-19 patients have spawned a government review in Britain and a court fight in Germany.
 Warning that Switzerland was running low on intensive care beds, the Swiss Society for Intensive Care Medicine (SGI) called this week on the "especially imperiled", including people over 60, or with health conditions like heart disease and diabetes, to put their wishes on paper in case the worst should happen.
 "This will support your own relatives, but also the teams in the ICUs, as they make decisions so the treatment can be done in the best possible manner according to the individual patient wishes," SGI said in a statement.
 Pro Senectute Schweiz said the call by the SGI, while in normal times sensible advice, created an impression of urgency inappropriate for a decision that demands deep consideration.
 "The SGI appeal...takes place in the context of an absolute emergency situation in which Switzerland does not yet find itself in," the group said.
 SGI president Thierry Fumeaux, an ICU doctor in the western Swiss city of Nyon, said the group was not aiming to put anyone under pressure or to free up beds, only to encourage them to think ahead.
 "This is not a call for sacrifice. It's just a call to take responsibility for their autonomy," Fumeaux said.
 Antonio Cuzzoli, who was head of intensive care at northern Italy's Cremona Hospital until July, said that as the coronavirus virus made the Lombardy region ground zero for infections in March and April, some patients committed "acts of heroism" by refusing treatment.
 Italy has a "declaration of renouncement of invasive treatment", but some in the pre-dominantly Roman Catholic country may refuse it on the basis that it conflicts with their faith, Cuzzoli said.
 In Switzerland, with its long history of legal assisted suicide, there may be less hesitation among people when it comes to making such personal decisions.
 In October, Britain's Department of Health and Social Care asked the Care Quality Commission, which monitors and inspects hospitals and nursing homes, to review how so-called "Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation" (DNACPR) decisions were conducted during the pandemic.
 The review was launched in response to concerns that the elderly and vulnerable were being subjected to DNACPR decisions without their consent or given too little information to make an informed decision.
 Emma Cave, a Durham University healthcare law professor who has written extensively about medical ethics, said the pandemic has intensified the dilemma of how to communicate with people at risk of COVID-19 about their options, should the worst occur.
 Nobody should face pressure, but refraining from talking with them may actually prevent them from getting treatment that matches their wishes, she said.
 "The difficulty in waiting is that many patients would benefit from consultation," Cave said. "A failure to have such a conversation risks not respecting their views and breaching their rights."
 Ethical issues around prioritising treatment of COVID-19 patients are also in German courts, where a lawsuit over triage rules - when hospitals become so overloaded that they must choose whom to treat and whom to leave to die - is pending.
 Plaintiffs with disabilities or underlying illness asked the Karlsruhe-based constitutional court to force the German government to establish such rules, fearing that otherwise they could be at a disadvantage. The court has expressed some doubts whether that this should be the government's role.
 In Switzerland, COVID-19 numbers have exploded during the second infection wave, rising from 100,000 weeks ago to more than 290,000 cases on Friday, when 4,946 new infections were recorded. The death toll is at 3,575.
 In the French-speaking region near Lake Geneva where infection rates are among Europe's highest, some hospitals have shifted patients elsewhere via helicopter, including the country's German-speaking north where the infection rate is lower, to free up ICU space.
 So far, the system is stretched thin, but holding up, with spare ICU capacity in much of the country, official data shows.
 "We are now under the 600 mark of hospitalised COVID patients," Bertrand Levrat, director of the Geneva University Hospital, told Reuters. "It's a good step, but we're far from relaxing."

 WASHINGTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Pressure for President Donald Trump to start the transition process to President-elect Joe Biden built among Republicans in the U.S. Congress on Friday, as several voiced doubts over Trump's claims of fraudulent voting.
 Senator Lamar Alexander, who is retiring at the end of the year, said Biden had a "very good chance" of becoming the next president, and urged the Trump administration to begin the transition process. The loser of this election should "put the country first, congratulate the winner and help him to a good beginning of the new term," the Tennessee senator wrote in a statement.
 Michigan Representative Fred Upton told reporters Friday, "I've not seen any evidence of fraud that would overturn 150,000 and some votes" that Biden leads Trump by in his home state. "No one has shown any evidence" of fraud in Michigan, Upton said.
 Alaska's conservative Senator Dan Sullivan told reporters Trump has "a high bar" to prove his claims the election has been stolen by Democrats. "And they've got to prove it in court," Sullivan said.
 Mitt Romney, the Utah Senator who has been a Trump critic, wrote on Twitter late Thursday that Trump had failed to make a "plausible case" of widespread election fraud, and was now trying to pressure state and local officials to overturn the election. "It is difficult to imagine a worse, more undemocratic action," he wrote.
 Until now, Republicans in Congress have mostly said Trump should have latitude in pursuing legal claims of wrongdoing in the election.
 Now, there is a cascading effect underway in the party, according to one Republican strategist who has advised campaigns for several years.
 First "never Trumpers" called on Trump to begin turning over power to Biden almost immediately after the Nov. 3 election, the strategist said on Friday, followed by "marginal never Trumpers" a week later.
 They are now being joined by Republicans who supported him reluctantly over the past four years, he said. "In reality, Republicans all over are turning the page" on Trump's presidency, he said.
 Republican Representative Jim Banks, the incoming chairman of a large group of conservative House Republicans, indirectly acknowledged Biden is likely to prevail, telling reporters that he expects the Democratic president-elect "to be a lame duck from Day One" in office.
 Still, the vast majority of Republicans in Congress have yet to acknowledge Biden's win publicly.
 Official certifications of election results in the 50 states have started rolling in, and are expected to show that Biden won some 6 million votes more than Trump, and 306 votes in the Electoral College that determines the winner, compared to Trump's 232.
 Trump insisted again on Friday that he won the election. But so far, the president's court challenges alleging fraud have either been dismissed or have failed to present evidence that would significantly cut into Biden's lead.
 A Thursday press conference in which Trump lawyer Rudolph Giuliani posed a series of election conspiracies that he said were waged against Trump, without providing any evidence, may have been a turning point for some former allies, two Republican sources said. They noted a lack of logic in Giuliani's presentation that they said undercut the president's argument. (Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Heather Timmons and Daniel Wallis)
