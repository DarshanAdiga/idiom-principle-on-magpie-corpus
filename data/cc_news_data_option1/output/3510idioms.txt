The easement, which will be held by the Cape Elizabeth Land Trust, includes an "option to purchase at agricultural value." That means if the property is ever sold, it must be for agriculture use or the trust may exercise an option to buy the farm at its agricultural value to ensure it remains accessible to farmers.

Now 67, Maxwell plans to retire in January from a full-time, seven-day work schedule that until recently didn't allow for summer vacations. In the works for more than a decade, the deal with the land trusts will make it possible for him to slow down and keep the farm.

It's an idyllic country setting, less than 3 miles as the crow flies from downtown Portland, Maine's largest city. And soon it will be preserved forever as active farmland.

This year, against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement, the debate followed the front line in the culture war over the colonial legacy. While the conservative press, after the retreat of the BBC, cheers that “Rule Britannia” will rule the airwaves again, a prominent voice from the left-wing liberal “Guardian” regrets the missed opportunity to “end this annual Suprematist indulgence once and for all”.

The Tigers opened the second half with a bang and a 52-yard run for a score on the first play of the third quarter. Just as Grainger did on their first scoring play, Pigeon Forge was not able to convert the two-point attempt and the game was tied at 6-6.
 Disaster struck the Grizzlies later on as they fumbled deep in Tigers’ territory. The Sevier County visitors wasted no time in making them pay with an 87-yard touchdown play. The Grainger defense stopped Pigeon Forge on the two-point carry, but the Tigers claimed the lead at 12-6.
 Grainger defeated Pigeon Forge last year and one of the Tigers’ key returning players was Hussein Al-Sultani. Al-Sultani was quiet for most of the first half, however, he made his presence known quickly in the second half when he was on the receiving end of a 39-yard bomb for a score. The PAT brought the score to 19-6, Pigeon Forge.
 “He’s a great player (Al-Sultani), great on both sides of the ball,” Tate said of one of the few mistakes his defense made all night. “Players make plays and he was able to make that play. There wasn’t much we could do on that because we were in good position on defense. He just went up and made a play.”
 The Grizzlies kept hanging around, and eventually put together an eight-play, 66-yard drive that was capped when Reggie McBee scored from the one-yard line. Even though the two-pointer was no good, the gap had been narrowed to seven points at 19-12.
 Grainger needed to get the ball back. They tried the on-side kick but Pigeon Forge recovered. The Tigers were deep in Grizzlies’ territory at the 31-yard line. Reggie McBee came up huge again when he smothered the Tigers on a fourth and four play. With time running out, the Grizzlies had a long way to go and a short time to get there in their hurry-up offense. Any thoughts of a Grainger rally came to an end with a Pigeon Forge interception, preserving the Tiger win over the Grizzlies.
 Conference play opens this Friday night in Kingsport when the Grizzlies tangle with the Rebels of Sullivan South. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.
