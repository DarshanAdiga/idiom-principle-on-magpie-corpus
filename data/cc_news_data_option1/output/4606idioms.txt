The motion of the ions can be monitored by the current they generate, and when a viral particle enters a nanopore, it blocks some of the ions from passing through, leading to a transient dip in current. Each dip reflects the physical properties of the particle, such as volume, surface charge, and shape, so they can be used to identify the kind of virus.

"I'm happy the boss trusts me and I'm going to keep repaying his faith with performances and nights like this, so hopefully I keep getting an opportunity and keep doing everyone proud."
 So far Williams has barely put a foot wrong when called upon, but he will face further tough tests if, indeed, Klopp puts him in the team straight away, with the likes of Leicester, Ajax, Wolves and Tottenham all coming up before Christmas.
 The Reds boss clearly has huge faith in the player, however, and praised the influence of elite development coach Vitor Matos for his role in Williams' development.
 Speaking about a previous injury crisis, Klopp said: “In that moment, Vitor came, ‘Yes, Rhys Williams. A big talent, he looks really promising and we should take him for training’ – and from the first moment he impressed.
 “Before that, I hadn’t heard much about Rhys, to be honest, and so that’s what I call a big impact because it has helped us massively. He is a good kid on top of that, a proper Scouser.”

 VILNIUS, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Lithuania's capital Vilnius is preparing to set up a 700-bed makeshift hospital in its largest exhibition centre, as the city fears its health system may soon get overloaded by coronavirus cases.
 Lithuania reported 1,433 new cases on Tuesday, bringing its total so far to 28,262 cases and 235 deaths. The number of daily cases has increased tenfold from a month ago.
 The town is launching tenders to buy oxygen equipment and beds, and is recruiting medical staff to work at the hospital. It will take six weeks to set up, Povilas Poderskis, head of city administration, told reporters.
 "We really hope the situation will not get so bad that we actually need the facility", he said. "It's better to be prepared even if we don't need it, than to be unprepared when we need it."
 The city has plans to increase the total number of beds in existing hospitals for treating COVID cases to about 350, at a cost of reducing regular medical services, he said. Hospitals in Vilnius were treating 88 coronavirus patients on Wednesday.
 The Litexpo exhibition centre is the largest in the Baltic states region. The three halls considered for the hospital have a total area of 6,700 square meters, according to its website.
 Lithuania's government declared a three-week lockdown on Nov. 6. The agrarian- led government is serving out the end of a lame duck term after losing an Oct. 25. general election, and a new centre-right government is due to take office in coming weeks.

Cilaos Emery tries two and a half miles for the first time as the Willie Mullins-trained gelding makes his seasonal debut in the Clonmel Oil Chase at the County Tipperary course on Thursday.
 The eight-year-old was fourth on his only previous attempt at the trip in the Hatton’s Grace Hurdle in 2017 behind Apples Jade, but has stuck to around two miles under both since codes since then.
 Cilaos Emery fell on his last race over fences at Leopardstown in February, after which connections put him back over the smaller obstacles. Following success in the Red Mills Trial Hurdle at Gowran, Cilaos Emery was supplemented for the Champion Hurdle, finishing fourth to Epatante.
 “When he fell on his prep run for the Champion Chase, owner Luke McMahon took the decision that the Champion Hurdle looked wide open and chanced that,” said Patrick Mullins, assistant to his father.
 “I think they got their money back for finishing fourth, but we are keen to go back over fences again.
 “Ruby (Walsh) felt going up to two and a half miles might help him. He had been a very keen horse in his younger days, but he seems to settle much better now so we’re hoping that two and a half won’t pose any problem.

Devon's Director of Public Health has said it is absolutely vital news there could be a Covid-19 vaccine on the horizon isn't taken as a green light to relax efforts in halting the spread of coronavirus.


--DocBreak--
On Monday (November 9), early results from the vaccine being developed by pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech showed it could prevent more than 90 per cent of people from getting Covid.
 The companies now plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of November and a limited number of people may get the vaccine this year, while the UK has already ordered 40 million doses – enough to vaccinate up to 20 million people as each person will need two doses for it to work effectively.
 Dr Virginia Pearson, director of Public Health Devon, said the news a vaccine may be available sooner rather than later is exceptionally good news.
 But she added: “It is however still early days, and while the announcement yesterday is tremendously positive, there is still a lot of work to do nationally before a programme of mass vaccination is possible, but the NHS is currently putting in place plans to deliver a Covid vaccine to priority groups.
  _Dr Virginia Pearson._
 “While the announcement is positive, it is absolutely vital that we do not take this it as a green light to relax our efforts in halting the spread of coronavirus. It is imperative therefore that we continue to make every effort to follow the national public health advice, to the letter.
 “That means, maintaining social distance, wearing face coverings when out and in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult, and washing our hands properly and regularly.
 “We are in week two of the current national lockdown restrictions. For these restrictions to halt the rising number of positive cases, we must all follow the current rules, and only to venture out for the permitted reasons, but otherwise to minimise social contact as much as possible.
 “Once out of the current national lockdown, we do not want additional restrictions in Devon. To avoid that, we need to remain absolutely alert to ongoing risk, at all times and in all situations.”
 And while mass coronavirus testing will be rolled out across 66 local authorities, Devon is not set to be one of the authorities to initially receive the tests.
 Lateral flow tests, with a turnaround time of under an hour, have been available since Friday for people who live and work in Liverpool and do not have symptoms.
 Speaking on Sky News on Tuesday (November 10), Health Secretary Matt Hancock said 66 local authorities had already expressed an interest in the tests.
 But a spokesman for Public Health Devon said that the county currently doesn’t qualify as they will be rolled out in the areas with higher infection rates first.

Scott McKenna has seen a new rival for a place in the Scotland back line emerge in impressive fashion and he could not be happier.
 The Nottingham Forest centre-back missed last month’s triple header through injury and the Scotland defence became even more stretched when Kieran Tierney and Liam Cooper dropped out.
 Steve Clarke turned to Aberdeen defender Andy Considine and the 33-year-old helped Scotland keep another two clean sheets to make it three on the trot and four victories in a row.
 McKenna is back in the squad ahead of Thursday’s Euro 2020 play-off against Serbia in Belgrade and is delighted to have his former Dons team-mate Considine for company.

Caretaker coach Robert Page has kept open the lines of communication to absent Wales manager Ryan Giggs by saying he is “a phone call away” for the side’s upcoming three matches.
 Giggs will miss Thursday’s friendly against the United States and the Nations League double-header against the Republic of Ireland and Finland after being arrested over an alleged row with girlfriend Kate Greville at his Manchester home on November 1.
 The 46-year-old former Manchester United star, who in a statement on his behalf has denied “all allegations of assault made against him”, has been bailed amid an ongoing Greater Manchester Police investigation.

Ireland head coach Andy Farrell believes Conor Murray secretly craves competition for the scrum-half position after Jamison Gibson-Park was given the nod to face Wales.
 Murray has been the long-standing first choice for his country’s number nine jersey, including starting each of the five Guinness Six Nations fixtures following Farrell’s appointment.
 New Zealand-born Gibson-Park will have an opportunity to stake his claim for that role on Friday when he makes his first Test start in the opening match of the inaugural Autumn Nations Cup.

 Farrell is eager to give chances to peripheral members of his 34-man squad and feels Murray – who will begin on the bench in Dublin – will appreciate being put under pressure.
 “That’s what we’re all hoping for and, do you know what, deep down I am sure that Conor is as well,” said Farrell.
 “We’ve got good people here and they warrant competition – whether they admit it or not – because that will make them better players and that’s how we move forward as a group.”
 Munster player Murray made his international debut in 2011 and has been an almost constant presence since, winning 83 caps in total.
 The 31-year-old saw off a challenge from the in-form John Cooney earlier in the year to continue his long-term half-back partnership with veteran captain Johnny Sexton.
 Farrell, who has shaken up his starting XV by making seven changes for the visit of Wayne Pivac’s side, is confident 28-year-old Leinster man Gibson-Park has the composure and attributes required to run games.
 “He can play very quickly but at the same time, without contradicting myself, he can play very calmly as well,” said Farrell.
 “His speed of ball is great, his skillset across the board with his hands and his kicking and his vision, decision-making is pretty good.

Bukayo Saka admits he and his Arsenal team-mates could not keep Jack Grealish quiet at the weekend despite specifically analysing the Aston Villa captain ahead of the game.
 Grealish was one of the star performers as Villa left the Emirates Stadium with a well-deserved 3-0 victory to move within three points of the Premier League summit.
 The 25-year-old has enjoyed an impressive season to date and could make his second England start when they face the Republic of Ireland in a Wembley friendly on Thursday night.
 Arsenal v Aston Villa – Premier League – Emirates Stadium (PA Wire)
 Saka highlighted Grealish as the most impressive player he saw during his first senior international camp last month.
 He then revealed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and his coaches looked at ways to stem Grealish’s impact on Sunday – although any plans clearly had little effect.
 “He is a top player,” Saka, who scored an own goal in the game, said when asked about Grealish.
 He was amazing from start to finish so it is going to be good to play with him and not against him this week
 “When I came here before in my first camp he was probably the player who impressed me the most in training.
 “Before we played against Villa at the weekend we did analyse him and we picked him out as one of their main threats and he showed it in the game.
 “He was amazing from start to finish so it is going to be good to play with him and not against him this week.”
 The defeat to Villa leaves Arsenal in the bottom half of the table, having now lost four of their opening eight league games.
 Bukayo Saka File Photo (PA Wire)
 Saka, who like Grealish will be pushing for another chance to impress for the Three Lions this week, said England boss Gareth Southgate told him to use this time to clear his head of the result.
 “He just asked me how the (Villa) game was, how I was feeling about it,” Saka told beIN Sports.
 “I just told him how I was disappointed that the result wasn’t so good and that we will bounce back after.
 “But he told me it was an opportunity for me to focus here, get that out of the way, clear my head and just have a positive week here with England.
 England v Denmark – UEFA Nations League – Group 2 – League A – Wembley Stadium (PA Wire)
 “After the game the boss (Arteta) did say to us that this is the beauty of this sport, that we will experience many highs and lows.
 “Last season when we came back from lockdown we lost two games in a row and things were looking really difficult for us.
 “But if you look at how we finished the season we won the FA Cup so we went from low to high really quick, we just have to keep going, keep our heads down.
 “I’m here with England now so just want to focus on that and we will take the games in our stride when we get back with Arsenal – I’m sure we will do, 100 per cent.”

Though Tynion and Johns' script has satisfying depth to it, Andolfo's art is the star of the show here. The very nature of the story requires her to chart the emotional course of this young woman as she moves from scared teenager to supervillain media darling and all the often-frightening steps in between, and that means Andolfo has to find different gears of expressiveness for each phase of the Alexis Kaye-Punchline scale, often on the same page. Then on _top_ of that, she has to chart the parallel story of Harper and Cullen Row as they both approach the Punchline problem from different sides, each zeroing in on the allure and the danger of this new Gotham superpersona with their own emotional arc. It's a masterful artistic performance, and it's only enhanced by a script that seeks to both show us as many phases of the title character as possible _and_ lay out an ambitious course for where she might go next. It's a great Punchline story, a great Harper Row story, and a great Gotham City story, and it's got me even more excited about DC Comics in 2021.

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s secretary of state on Wednesday announced an audit of presidential election results that he said will trigger a full hand recount.Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said at a news conference that his office wants the process to begin by the end of the week and he expects it to take until Nov. 20, which is the certification deadline.President-elect Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by about 14,000 votes out of nearly 5 million votes in the state. Nearly all ballots have been counted, though counties have until Friday to certify their results.Once county certification is complete and before the state certifies the results, the count must be audited. It is up to Raffensperger to choose which race to audit.The audit is a new requirement put in place by a law passed in 2019 that also provided for the new voting machines purchased last year. The state has chosen to do a risk-limiting audit, in which a random sample of ballots or receipts generated by voting machines are checked against results produced by vote-tallying equipment for accuracy.Raffensperger chose to audit the presidential race and said the tight margin means that the audit will result in a full hand recount.Asked if he chose the presidential race because of the Trump campaign’s call for a hand recount, Raffensperger said, “No, we’re doing this because it’s really what makes the most sense with the national significance of this race and the closeness of this race.”For the hand recount, election officers will work with the paper ballots in batches, dividing them into piles for each candidate. Then they will run the piles through machines to count the number of ballots for each candidate. The scanners will not read the data on the ballots, simply count them.Raffensperger said the process will have “plenty of oversight,” with both parties having the opportunity to observe.After results from the hand recount are certified, the losing campaign can then request another recount, which will be performed by scanners that would read and tally the votes, Raffensperger said.There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden’s lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Wednesday morning.In addition to the audit of the presidential race, Raffensperger announced that he’s consolidating runoff elections. A runoff for any state races was set to be held Dec. 1, while the runoffs for two U.S. Senate races was set for Jan. 5. Raffensperger said he’s consolidating those runoffs on Jan. 5.The one exception is the runoff for the special election to fill the remainder of U.S. Rep. John Lewis' term. That election will still be held Dec. 1. The person who wins that election will serve for about a month before Nikema Williams, who was just elected to succeed Lewis, who died in July.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Pepper noticed some opportunities where DeChambeau's distance will serve him well. "I walked the golf course with Bryson in mind today. And I looked at different places somebody who could carry the ball that far would hit it and places that they would cut corners. There is a gap in 13 that he could take it up high and left and take it into an area that's beyond the trees and pushing the 14th fairway. It can be done. The same thing at eight. He's going to have to shoot that ball in there a little bit. And at five. If he misses left in the bunkers -- they're pretty much pitch-out bunkers. But if he can carry it up there, in these conditions, there are definitely advantages. We need to be reminded that it's still getting the ball in the hole. And while he did it at Winged Foot, I think this is a little bit different animal we're looking at here at Augusta National."

There is no mandatory recount law in Georgia, but state law provides that option to a trailing candidate if the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Biden's lead stood at 0.28 percentage points as of Wednesday morning.
 In addition to the audit of the presidential race, Raffensperger announced that he's consolidating runoff elections. A runoff for any state races was set to be held Dec. 1, while the runoffs for two U.S. Senate races was set for Jan. 5. Raffensperger said he's consolidating those runoffs on Jan. 5.
 The one exception is the runoff for the special election to fill the remainder of U.S. Rep. John Lewis' term. That election will still be held Dec. 1. The person who wins that election will serve for about a month before Nikema Williams, who was just elected to succeed Lewis, who died in July.

Single-Hits hatte dieser mit einer gewöhnungsbedürftig fragilen (manche sagen: fisteligen) Stimme ausgestattete Musiker nur sehr sporadisch. Am nächsten dran an einer weltweiten Charts-Karriere war Young als Mitglied der populären Folkrock-Supergruppe Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young, mit der er 1969 beim legendären Woodstock-Festival  auftrat. Und wenig später mit dem zarten Countrypop-Album «Harvest» (1972) inklusive der Sehnsuchtsballade «Heart Of Gold».

 “There is enough experience in the coaching staff to be able to go and get through these three games.
 “If we need some input or a conversation about anything, we know he is a phone call away.
 “We’re in a good place coming into the last two qualifiers. If it’s not broke, don’t fix it. There’s momentum coming into this camp.”
 Captain Gareth Bale is available after picking up a knock playing for Tottenham last weekend.

The metaphors Roche is playing with here are both clear and well-articulated, blending the horrors of hectic parenting with the horrors of evil forces lurking in the places you least expect them, but as with so many stories like this what makes _Scarenthood_ a true joy is all in the execution. It's scary, yes, and the first issue packs a satisfying slow-burn that pays off really well by the end, but what I wasn't expecting was just how funny the book is on a sentence-by-sentence level as Roche builds out the personalities of the parents at the school. His art, helped along by Chris O'Halloran's colors, also packs a certain wit that only serves to underscore just how potent the horror elements are when they come into view. Working with often widescreen- style panels to highlight just how big and daunting this little world is to his characters, Roche manages to make the humor and the horror play equally well, sometimes on the same page. _Scarenthood_ is a delight that I can't wait to keep reading.

 “This night was even better than their dreams, so that was really nice. Now, let’s carry on with that.”
 And "carry on with that" it looks like they will, with Jones also getting a lot more minutes than perhaps he was initially expecting at the start of this season.
 Williams himself seemed scarcely able to believe what was happening to him after the Atalanta game, although he hinted he was hoping there would be more games of a similar significance to come soon for him.
 "Well, I was hoping for an opportunity but I wasn't hoping for it as good as this!" he said.
 "It doesn't get much better than a 5-0 away win to Atalanta, so I'm over the moon really.
