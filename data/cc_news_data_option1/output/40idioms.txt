Queens 3-2 Bangor
 For their part, the fixture provides Ballymena with an opportunity to move a step closer to ending the 25 years of hurt since their last Irish Cup success in 1989.
 The Oval has been a relatively happy hunting ground for the Sky Blues in recent seasons, with six away wins against Glentoran from their last nine league visits.
 The East Belfast ground also played host to their dramatic County Antrim Shield final penalty shootout win over Linfield in November 2012.
 However, it was also the scene of Irish Cup semi-final heartbreak when a Mark Dickson penalty consigned the Braidmen to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Larne in 2005.
 United survived a scare in the fifth round of this year's competition as a late Darren Boyce goal at Tillysburn forced a replay against Harland and Wolff Welders, from which they eventually emerged triumphant.
 Confidence was boosted by a sixth-round win over Linfield at Windsor Park, but that may have been partially eroded by some indifferent league form in recent weeks.
 The news that they had been drawn against lower division opposition was greeted with cheers from Ballymena supporters when the draw was made in the club's boardroom, but Ferguson has warned his charges against any complacency.
 "We are the senior team and we'll be expected to win, but it's up to us to live up to that billing and prove that we are superior.
 "We have watched Queen's a number of times and they are well organised defensively, they don't concede many goals and they have players who have played at a higher level.
 "The incentive is a great day out for the players, fans and everyone associated with the club at the showpiece occasion of the season."

Queen's University manager Peter Thompson says his side will not be overawed by Saturday's Irish Cup semi-final against Ballymena United.
 "As long as we do that I'll be happy. I'm very proud of what my players have achieved and they should be proud of themselves."
 Thompson is particularly looking forward to pitting his wits against Ballymena counterpart Glenn Ferguson, who took over the reins at the Warden Street club at the end of 2011.
 "My own personal motivation is winning games and tactically setting myself up against other managers. It's two young managers going head to head, even if there is a lot more playing experience on the Ballymena bench.
 "It's so exciting for our players and for the club and we can't wait. We are very much the fairytale and all the pressure is on Ballymena."
 Following a number of seasons in the NI Intermediate League, Queen's returned to the Irish League in 2003 and having been forced to play their home games at Newforge for many years, they are now basking in their impressive new facilities at The Dub.
 The club also have lofty league ambitions this campaign as they are locked in a five-way battle at the top of the Championship Two table, along with Annagh United, Armagh City, PSNI and Newington Youth Club, who themselves assumed the role of giant-killers when they caused a major upset by beating Glentoran in the Irish Cup two years ago.
 Thompson, who played for Queen's as a student, says the club's dream run to the semi-finals of the country's premier knockout competition is just reward for many years of hard work on and off the pitch.
 "Usually by the time the club has reached March or April, they haven't had anything to play for, so it's wonderful that the players are being faced with big games on two fronts - in the Irish Cup and in Championship Two.
 "The whole mentality of the club has changed - I'm a big believer in the psychology of winning and we have become used to winning this year."

I think the decisive pressure for action on board diversity, restitution, and dirty money won’t come from outside protests but internally, from staff. Decolonize the Museum is a disparate, unfocused, noisy creature, fixated on Israel and possibly -- who knows -- animated by anti-Semitism. Whether or not anti-Semitism is what you’ll find if you scratch the surface of Decolonize the Museum, museum staff, especially curators, are broadly sympathetic to most of its policy platform. Depending on the guts and fortitude of museum leadership, they might win the day. When I was a young curator and director, I strongly supported restitution of Nazi-seized art and Native American grave objects. It was an outré opinion. My older colleagues hated both ideas but, over time, they retired, died, or surrendered. Now, these concerns are hard-wired in best practices.

 Patricia Ilene Myers passed from this earth on Dec. 23, 2019, after living an amazing and full life. Born on March 24, 1942, in Hoven, South Dakota, Pat grew up on a farm. After high school, she yearned to see the world and joined the Women's Army Corps, and eventually ended up working as a neuropsychiatric aid in many places around the country. Pat finished her term of duty as a Vietnam-era veteran in Okinawa serving in a psychiatric unit for the soldiers who fought in Southeast Asia. She was awarded a Quilt of Valor for that service. After Pat met her husband, John Myers (divorced), she worked as a nurse at Saint Joseph Hospital in Fairbanks. Later, she assisted him in his law enforcement career, often serving as unofficial dispatcher in places like Fort Yukon and Cantwell in the late '60s. She joined him in the places he served all over Alaska. She raised two children, Sam and Christina Myers. Her life was then dedicated to her children, and Christina's fatal battle with cystic fibrosis. She worked at Fairbanks Fast Photo for many years as well. She was a perfectionist at printing and made many friends there. After her divorce from John, Pat became a dedicated student, earning a bachelor's degree in social work. Pat was a driven volunteer for the youths of Alaska, and spent two days a week spending time with youths at the Fairbanks Youth Facility for many years. She also served as a board member at the Perspiration Hospitality House, an organization that housed troubled children. She won the prestigious Lewis Hines Award and the First Lady's (Alaska) Award, for her work with children in Alaska. Pat traveled with Sam to New York and Juneau to receive those awards. Her New York trip held special memories for her. Pat loved to garden and travel. Every year, you could find the loveliest flowers at her home. Her last big trip, when she turned 75, was to Puerto Vallarta, and she got to experience the real Mexico with Sam, who had visited there many times. The trip to her niece Amber's wedding also held a warm place in her heart. She made a side trip to Catalina Island, enjoying it immensely. Pat traveled many other places around the country and world but never wished to live any other location than Fairbanks, a place close to her heart. Pat was a proud member of the Pioneers of Alaska, the AARP and the Sourdoughs of Alaska. She held executive positions in both the AARP and the Pioneers. Always willing to lend a hand to a child in need of company, Pat will be missed. She is proceeded in death by mother, Olivia Beckler; father, Lyle Beckler; and daughter, Christina Myers. She is survived by son, Sam Myers; brother, Mike Beckler; sister, Sandra South; niece, Amber Beckler; and nephews, Nick and Dan Beckler. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Jan. 17 at Immaculate Conception Church. Reception to follow at the church. Online condolences may be made at blanchardfamilyfuneralhome.com.

Attacking the BJP for trying to stop the mega parent-teacher meeting (PTM) in Delhi government schools, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday that education should be a part of politics, but one shouldn't politicise the education system.Speaking to the media after visiting a school in Rouse Avenue, Kejriwal said that vote should be given to those who provide good education, and not to those who try to create divisions among the people on the basis of religion.On being told the BJP is criticising the mega PTM and its timing, as Delhi will go to the polls in a few weeks time, the Chief Minister said that this was not the first such meeting."If they (the opposition) feel it is a poll gimmick, what can I say. They also tried to stop it. But it is wrong. There should be no politics with education and schooling. However, education should be a part of politics. I don't understand why they want to stop this," he told the media.Delhi government on Saturday organised the mega PTM across all its schools. Mega PTM in Delhi government schools was launched in July 2016 after the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi a year before. The AAP government claims that it has significantly enhanced parent- teacher interaction and partnership in children's education.Kejriwal said the PTM was only a concept in private schools earlier."In government schools, this used to happen only on paper. PTM is crucial for students' growth," he said.Apart from Kejriwal, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia also visited schools in the city on Saturday."Had a lovely interaction with the parents on the unbelievable heights our children can reach, only if we put unflinching support behind them, irrespective of our own backgrounds," Sisodia tweeted after the visit.He said he felt good to see parents being welcomed warmly by the schools and having meaningful conversations with the teachers about education and their children.
