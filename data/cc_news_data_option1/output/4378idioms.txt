No roadkill today.


  My mom declared squirrels “devious and manipulative.” She tried everything conceivable to keep them from surreptitiously snatching seeds from her bird feeders.


  Alas, it was an exercise in futility.


  Summer is gone now. I can feel that impending, wintry gloom in my bones. Yet those senseless squirrels continue to frolic.


  Suddenly, a ray of light shone through the cold mist. Actually, I heard it before I saw it.


  Its head, resplendently red, should make Carrot Top jealous. That jackhammer he calls a beak was pecking precisely and persistently on a tree trunk just across the street.


  A red-headed, pileated woodpecker!


  So colorful. So incredibly exotic!


  That’s the first one I’ve seen in nearly a year and a half. My mom was infatuated with them. One occasionally graced the large tree my dad planted on our front lawn when I was a child.


  “Let’s see those squirrels steal his food,” my mom said with a smile.


  Live and let live.


  There are ample streets and trees for all of us.


  Build your nests. Thrive. Share.


  But, no more jaywalking, and quit running those stop signs!


  In conclusion, don’t be so ... squirrelly.

Amid rising air pollution in the national capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched the "Green Delhi" app, which will enable people to register complaints about violation of anti-pollution norms.


  "Today we are launching the Green Delhi app. Our aim is to involve each and every citizen in this initiative. This app can be installed from the Play Store. You can file any kind of complaint regarding pollution via this app. If you witness industrial pollution or industrial dust, you can upload its video, picture, or audio. Automatically the location will be sent to us," said Kejriwal.


  "Particular department will receive the complaint and they will have to work in a time-bound manner. If the citizen is not satisfied with the solution, he or she can re-open that complaint," he added. Delhi Government has set up a green war room to monitor the status of the complaints that works round the clock, the chief minister stated.


  "70 green martial have been deployed. They will help in solving the complaints," he added.


  The Delhi chief minister said that amid the rising air pollution here, the Delhi government along with the citizens is taking various steps to reduce the pollution.


  "We have taken initiatives in the last five years as well following which the pollution here has been reduced by 25%. We are still taking steps like all the thermal power plants are all closed in Delhi. Fuel has been changed in 95% of the industries in Delhi. Now they are using non polluting fuels," said Kejriwal. He said that Delhi has set an example by bringing up an initiative to decompose the stubble and making it compost by spraying a chemical.


  "The results are satisfactory. If this is successful, we will get a solution for stubble working by next year. We have also launched the Electronic Vehicle Policy," he added.

As Zora, Artemis, Bach and the rest of the gang race to find the firestarter before he sets another blaze and takes another life, their progress is hindered by the crew of “Dead Men Walking” and vigilante justice. How can Zora save the town if she can’t keep herself alive?


  Zappia does an amazing job building a world that is so authentic it captures the essence of small-town life in Indiana. The residents of Addamsville know everything about everyone and they aren’t afraid to use what they know to serve their own purpose. But all is not lost in Addamsville, because, like in most close-knit communities, when the chips are down, loyalty is the cornerstone on which friendships are built.


  Zora Novak is a flawed character with a chip on her shoulder and a yearning for acceptance. Her mother’s disappearance and Zora’s refusal to give up on her tugs at the heartstrings of the reader even as the flame of hope dwindles. Her struggles with Bach’s past mirror the struggles she has with herself, as she goes from being a loner who shuns the help of others, to a resourceful young woman who understands that sometimes, it’s not about lurking in the dark trying to make amends but rather standing up in the light. She is a strong character whose attempts to manage the chaos in her paranormal town often go awry.


  With “Now Entering Addamsville,” Zappia has written a Southern Gothic-esque paranormal story with roots firmly planted in Indiana small-town life. Fans of “Stranger Things” will enjoy this tale full of hijinks, adventure and unexpected twists that pulls the reader into the story and doesn’t let go until the mind-blowing end. While this book differs from Zappia’s previous novels, fans of her world-building skills will not be disappointed.

"Although we have made it through, we have been damaged, we have been hit," she said.
 Along coastal Louisiana, there were reports of some trailers flipped over, a gas station destroyed, and downed power lines and trees.
 Zeta had top sustained winds of 110 mph (177 kph) as a Category 2 hurricane at landfall and is the 27th named storm of a historically busy Atlantic hurricane season -- with over a month left to go. It set a new record as the 11th named storm to make landfall in the continental U.S. in a single season, well beyond the nine storms that hit in 1916.
 Zeta weakened to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (144 kph) as it moved into southern Mississippi a few hours after landfall.
 As much as 5 feet of Gulf water surrounded a casino in Biloxi, Mississippi, and deputies in Harrison County, Mississippi, received multiple calls from people who had remained in mobile homes that were threatened by winds.
 In the small coastal town of Bay St. Louis in Mississippi, former mayor Les Fillingame said the storm was "very intense" when it blew through.
 "It was a noisy storm. It was a truly howling wind," he said, but said thankfully it was also fast-moving. "It was a lot of wind for several hours which is enough."
 Tropical storm warnings were issued as far away as southern Virginia, highly unusual for the region. Forecasters issued a string of tornado warnings for as far east as the Florida Panhandle.
 New Orleans was in the warning areas of six previous storms that veered east or west this season. This time, Zeta stayed on course. Officials had been worried about the loss of a power from a turbine that helps power the city's aging drainage infrastructure and whether that would leave the city vulnerable to flooding but Zeta's swift movement meant flooding wasn't an issue.
 On Tuesday, Zeta raked across Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, toppling trees and briefly cutting power to more than 300,000 people but causing no deaths.
 It then regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico along a path slightly to the east of those of Hurricane Laura, which was blamed for at least 27 deaths in Louisiana in August, and Hurricane Delta, which exacerbated Laura's damage in the same area weeks later.
 The deteriorating weather prompted early voting sites to close for hours in the western Florida Panhandle. One voter in Mississippi worried about how long felled trees and debris might block roads.
 "With the election I just kind of hope the city gets the roads clear by November 3rd so everybody can get out and vote," said Mackenzie Umanzor, of D'Iberville, Mississippi.
 An average season sees six hurricanes and 12 named storms. This extraordinarily busy season has focused attention on climate change, which scientists say is causing wetter, stronger and more destructive storms.
 And the fact that so many of the storms have been concentrated in such a small piece of Gulf Coast real estate has meant repeated damage for some places. On Dauphin Island, Alabama, Mayor Jeff Collier said residents and workers had nearly finished cleaning up from Hurricane Sally when the wind started blowing and the water started rising yet again.
 "This is going to put his back to square one again," Collier said.

"Another thing is that they're saying we're depreciating the value," she added. "Actually, we add value because when we mention brands in hip-hop, sh*t go up." She was referring to how her song lyrics with mentions of luxury brands improve the sales situation and search results of the company, for example, her "Bodak Yellow" track was a hit and it directly increased designer Christian Louboutin's revenue for that season. She added, "when 'Bodak Yellow' came out you could actually Google that their sales went up 1000+ percent." She has a point as even when in her song "I Like It Like That" she mentioned the shoes by Cristobal Balenciaga in her song lyrics, "I like those Balenciaga's, the ones that look like socks" right after it the company saw a huge spike in the search for that product and also improved their sales which is why Cardi revealed that this is the reason why the brand Balenciaga worked with her this year, thus claiming, "like hip-hop, we start trends."

Following a move to virtual learning last week, McLean County Public Schools announced this week that it would continue virtual learning as the county continues to remain in the red zone for COVID-19 positivity rates.


  MCPS originally opted for virtual learning as the county moved from 26.1% to 51.2% on the state’s color-coded incident rate map for positive testing rates. A county is considered “critical” in the red zone at a rate of more than 25%.


  As of Monday, McLean’s positivity rate has increased to 80.7%.


  MCPS announced that it would remain virtual at least through Monday when Superintendent Tommy Burrough said he would provide an update on the situation and determine whether to continue virtually or if would be deemed safe for students to return to in-person classes.


  On Tuesday, MCPS reported at least eight positive COVID-19 cases in students, two in teachers, and at least 106 quarantined students, as well as four staff members quarantined.


  “I don’t see how we can come back until we start seeing the county cases go down, but we’ll keep an eye on it every day,” Burrough said during the Oct. 22 board of education meeting. “My job is to ensure the safety of all staff and students, so until I see it safe, we’re probably going to hang with the virtual for a while.”

Pakistan's state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.


  Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.


  The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June. Khan's decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.


  Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple's construction with force, raising tensions. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple's construction.


   


   


  It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council's ruling. However, the council's ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.


  Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple's construction.


  Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don't use it for fear of attacks.


  About 3,000 Hindus live in Islamabad with its population of more than 1 million, mostly Muslims.


  Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, but there have been incidents in which Hindu girls were forcibly converted to Islam.


  Most of the country's Hindus migrated to India from present day Pakistan in 1947 when India was divided by Britain's government. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India have a history of bitter relations. They have fought three wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety.

The documentary Soul of a Banquet explains that Chiang was born into a wealthy Shanghai family with two full-time chefs — one from the north and one from the south. (The film also features drool-inducing close ups of her specialties, like red cooked pork and fish stuffed with ginger and pepper. Don't watch it while you're hungry.) Speaking to the camera, former _Gourmet_ magazine editor Ruth Reichl says food connected Chiang to a vanished era: "She has this taste memory that goes back to a time that — there aren't a lot of people alive who remember the food of that China, the great food of the great houses, when what you had were chefs who had been classically trained."


  That China no longer exists. In 1937, when Japan bombed Shanghai, Chiang had just started college. She and an older sister fled, walking hundreds of miles to the city of Chengdu. Eighty years later, Chiang told NPR about getting robbed by soldiers and hiding from low-flying Japanese warplanes. "Now I think about it, I was very brave," she said.


  Chiang had to flee her home a second time when the Communists took over. She wound up in the U.S., where she was both shocked and amused by the food most Americans considered to be Chinese — like gloppy chop suey.

Stone Town (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 29th Oct, 2020 ) :Tanzania's polls commission began releasing parliamentary election results on Thursday with the opposition losing key seats in a vote they said was riddled with irregularities.


  Counting was taking place across Tanzania and its semi-autonomous archipelago Zanzibar \-- which also elects its own president and lawmakers -- after the opposition reported ballot box stuffing and their party agents thrown out of polling stations.


  As results trickled out on state tv, opposition Chadema lawmaker and chairman Freeman Mbowe lost his long-held seat at Hai in the Kilimanjaro region, one of several lost by the opposition.


  "We can't talk about elections. It is violence. There were several deplorable incidents across the country," Mbowe told AFP on Wednesday.


  Mbowe, who was brutally assaulted in what he said was a politically-motivated attack in June, tweeted that his life was "in danger" on the eve of the election, accusing police of raiding his hotel.


  There are 264 parliamentary seats up for grabs in the election.


  Election commission chairman Wilson Charles Mahera said they would shortly begin releasing results from a presidential race in which John Magufuli is seeking a second term in office.

Following a move to virtual learning last week, McLean County Public Schools announced Monday that it would continue virtual learning as the county continues to remain in the red zone for COVID-19 positivity rates.


  MCPS originally opted for virtual learning as the county moved from 26.1% to 51.2% on the state’s color-coded incident rate map for positive testing rates. A county is considered “critical” in the red zone at a rate more than 25%.


  As of Monday, Oct. 26, McLean’s positivity rate has increased to 80.7%.


  MCPS announced that it would remain virtual at least through next Monday when superintendent Tommy Burrough said he would provide an update on the situation and determine whether to continue virtually or if would be deemed safe for students to return to in-person classes.


  On Tuesday, MCPS reported at least eight positive COVID-19 cases in students, two in teachers, and at least 106 quarantined students, as well as four staff members quarantined.


  “I don’t see how we can come back until we start seeing the county cases go down, but we’ll keep an eye on it every day,” Burrough said during the Oct. 22 board of education meeting. “My job is to ensure the safety of all staff and students, so until I see it safe, we’re probably going to hang with the virtual for a while.”

Adjusted earnings after tax \- equals the sum of net operating income/(loss) less income tax in business areas and adjustments to operating income taking the applicable marginal tax into consideration. Adjusted earnings after tax excludes net financial items and the associated tax effects on net financial items. It is based on adjusted earnings less the tax effects on all elements included in adjusted earnings (or calculated tax on operating income and on each of the adjusting items using an estimated marginal tax rate). In addition, tax effect related to tax exposure items not related to the individual reporting period is excluded from adjusted earnings after tax. Management considers adjusted earnings after tax, which reflects a normalised tax charge associated with its operational performance excluding the impact of financing, to be a supplemental measure to Equinor's net income. Certain net USD denominated financial positions are held by group companies that have a USD functional currency that is different from the currency in which the taxable income is measured. As currency exchange rates change between periods, the basis for measuring net financial items for IFRS will change disproportionally with taxable income which includes exchange gains and losses from translating the net USD denominated financial positions into the currency of the applicable tax return. Therefore, the effective tax rate may be significantly higher or lower than the statutory tax rate for any given period. Adjusted taxes included in adjusted earnings after tax should not be considered indicative of the amount of current or total tax expense (or taxes payable) for the period

Commodity prices have historically been volatile. Significant downward adjustments of Equinor's commodity price assumptions would result in impairment losses on certain producing and development assets in Equinor's portfolio, while an opposite adjustment could lead to impairment-reversals. If a decline in commodity price forecasts over the lifetime of the assets were 30%, considered to represent a reasonably possible change, the impairment amount to be recognised could illustratively be in the region of USD 12 billion before tax effects. This illustrative impairment sensitivity, based on a simplified method, assumes no changes to input factors other than prices; however, a price reduction of 30% is likely to result in changes in business plans as well as other factors used when estimating an asset's recoverable amount. These associated changes reduce the stand-alone impact on commodity price sensitivity.

T.J. Sanders' team was already in commanding position, but the senior for the Marion High School Swamp Foxes was still breaking things down.


  Coming off the field Monday in the midst of a blowout win to secure a region title, he was animated, talking a teammate through the finer points of a particular blocking scheme. The 6-foot-5, now-300 pounder quickly went from a player who had to be coaxed from the basketball court to the football field to a future SEC player with the South Carolina Gamecocks.


  And he also made another transition: From a player with minimal experience to one who could lead a team in just a second year.


  "He just became a total leader," Marion coach Randall State said, noting Sanders was in for an extra weightlifting session the day before the game. "He was always the leader on the basketball court. It took him a year to kind of settle in, coming back as a football player.


  "He's always been a vocal guy, on and off the court, and he's smart with it."

Wrecked cars stood at awkward angles. Someone had draped blankets over bodies inside two of the cars. A pair of shoes and more blood lay on the ground beside another vehicle. The road was blackened and the air smelled of explosives.


  “Why did they do that to him?” wailed a woman in black, as two men supported her on each arm. “People! Please look at what they are doing. Why did they kill him? Please God, help us.”


  Rescue workers levered open one of the car doors with an iron bar. As they lifted the blanketed form out the woman sank to the ground. “My baby,” she cried.


  Across the street two more people had been cut down on the sidewalk. A man and a woman, they lay under blankets amid broken branches and fallen leaves.


  One was Fuad Izmayilov, 31, a sports teacher, who died just outside the gate to his mother’s house.


  Grief stricken, blood smeared on her face, his mother cradled his head and wept.


  “He was coming to tell us something was happening, and he died,” said his mother, Tabiat Izmayilova.


  A widow, Izmayilova said she was a refugee from Armenia, among the Azerbaijanis who left the country when the first war broke out more than 30 years ago. “I have lost everyone, and now this.”


  She bemoaned that she had not seen her son married, and said she had planned to decorate the house for him to live in when he did wed.


  “Why did you do this to us?” she asked aloud. “Armenians, don’t you have children?”


  “I want peace. I do not want anyone to suffer this,” she told me. But she was rambling, and in the same breath she demanded Azerbaijan take retaliatory action. “Tell our president to stop this, to take all necessary actions.”


  There is every sign that the war is escalating and casualties are mounting.


  In all, 21 people died in downtown Barda in the rocket strike and 70 people were wounded, the government said in the evening, adding that the rockets were fired from a Russian-made Smerch multiple-rocket system and unleashed cluster bomblets. Designed to be used against armies in open spaces, cluster bombs are banned in much of the world because of their danger to civilians in residential areas.


  Armenia denied responsibility for the attack.


  The two main cities of the Armenian-controlled territory of Nagorno-Karabakh also came under rocket attack on Wednesday, as they have on a regular basis since the fighting began. A city hospital was damaged in the regional capital of Stepanakert and a civilian was killed and another wounded in Shusha, the local Emergency and Rescue Service said.


  There is evidence that both sides have used cluster bombs. Human Rights Watch criticised Azerbaijan for using cluster munitions against civilian areas of Nagorno-Karabakh at least four times this month.


  In the morning, we had visited Garayusifli, a sleepy farming village just outside Barda, where people were burying victims of another rocket attack. Four people died, including a 7-year-old girl, and more than a dozen were wounded. Children had been playing on their bikes, and their parents sitting in the shade of their gardens, when the missile exploded, scattering cluster bomblets over the houses of several neighbours.


  In Barda, some of the wounded being treated in the city’s hospital said they had first heard an explosion that seemed some distance away and then heard what they said were cluster bombs falling.


  Zergelam Aliyeva, 18, said she thought the first explosion was an air defence mechanism hitting down the missile. “Then we heard the clusters coming down. They made a sh-sh-sh sound and then they started raining shrapnel on us.”


  “When I heard the sound I laid down on the ground,” she said. Her friend, Aysun Ismayilova, 15, lying in the next bed, suffered worse injuries. “She ran away and it landed in front of her,” she said.


  “We could not believe they could fire on our village,” said Elnure Karimova, 17, who was also wounded, “because there is no military, only civilians.”

THE legal fees incurred in defending the reputation of Goffs and its executives in a “scurrilous defamation case” last year contributed to pre-tax profits declining by 33pc to €1.53m. That is according to chairman of bloodstock sales firm Goffs, Eimear Mulhern, who also stated that other one- off expenditure contributed to the decline in pre-tax profit in the 12 months to the end of March this year. In July of last year, James Carney made an apology in the High Court to Goffs concerning &ldquo;defamatory posts&rdquo; on social media he made over the 2011 sale of a horse, &lsquo;Sensational Sema&rsquo;, in which he had an interest.The proceedings taken by Goffs against Mr Carney were resolved at the High Court following the court apology from Mr Carney of Main Street, Arklow, Co Wicklow.In her report attached to the annual financial statements for Robert J Goff &amp; Co, Ms Mulhern stated that the other one-off costs arose from fees associated with a 50-bedroom hotel development and an increase in debtor provision in view of what she called, &ldquo;the unprecedented economic conditions&rdquo;.Goffs has consistently paid out dividends to its shareholders in recent years, paying out €366,000 last year and €566,000 in 2018.However, Ms Mulhern has told shareholders, &ldquo;given the unprecedented times we find ourselves and in order to preserve cash in the company, your board has deemed it prudent to recommend that no dividend be paid this year&rdquo;.The daughter of former Taoiseach Charlie Haughey stated that 2019 was &ldquo;another satisfactory year&rdquo; for Goffs as ring turnover increased by 5pc to €174.73m across 25 auctions.Sales were boosted by the sale of four millionaire yearlings – including Galileo, who fetched €3m at Goffs&rsquo;s 2019 Orby Sale.In his report, group CEO of Goffs Henry Beeby warns that the company &ldquo;may have some difficult decisions to make, some of which could have short-term negative consequences&rdquo; in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Mr Beeby has told shareholders, &ldquo;We will approach each of them in a calm way and always take account of what is best for the wider industry rather than short-term sectoral interests, including our own.&rdquo; Mr Beeby further states that he does not see any sale being straightforward for the time being due to Covid.The long-serving CEO states that the year is proving challenging in a way that no one could have foreseen but that Goffs is well placed to adapt and react.On the Covid impact, a note in the accounts states notwithstanding the uncertainty, the directors are confident that the group will retain a strong, well funded and liquid balance sheet. Goffs&rsquo; net revenues increased by 3pc from €16.95m to €17.48m in the 12 months to the end of March this year.Staff costs increased from €5.14m to €5.29m as numbers employed remained at the same level at 92. The staff costs include pay to directors, which last year increased from €1.15m to €1.22m. Key management personnel were last year paid €2.87m.At the end of March, Goffs had shareholder funds totalling €32.2m including accumulated profits of €16.9m.

Amid rising air pollution in the national capital, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched the "Green Delhi" app, which will enable people to register complaints about violation of anti-pollution norms."Today we are launching the Green Delhi app. Our aim is to involve each and every citizen in this initiative. This app can be installed from the Play Store. You can file any kind of complaint regarding pollution via this app. If you witness industrial pollution or industrial dust, you can upload its video, picture, or audio. Automatically the location will be sent to us," said Kejriwal. "Particular department will receive the complaint and they will have to work in a time-bound manner. If the citizen is not satisfied with the solution, he or she can re-open that complaint," he added. Delhi Government has set up a green war room to monitor the status of the complaints that works round the clock, the chief minister stated. "70 green martial have been deployed. They will help in solving the complaints," he added. The Delhi chief minister said that amid the rising air pollution here, the Delhi government along with the citizens is taking various steps to reduce the pollution."We have taken initiatives in the last five years as well following which the pollution here has been reduced by 25%. We are still taking steps like all the thermal power plants are all closed in Delhi. Fuel has been changed in 95% of the industries in Delhi. Now they are using non polluting fuels," said Kejriwal. He said that Delhi has set an example by bringing up an initiative to decompose the stubble and making it compost by spraying a chemical."The results are satisfactory. If this is successful, we will get a solution for stubble working by next year. We have also launched the Electronic Vehicle Policy," he added.

TORONTO - It's unlikely most Canadians will enjoy a holly jolly Christmas season of gatherings, carolling and travel, say public health experts who encourage those who revel in holiday traditions to accept more sacrifices ahead.


  As the pandemic's second wave maintained its grip in many parts of the country, political leaders acknowledged this week that recent limits on social gatherings, restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues in some hot spots have not significantly changed the trajectory of COVID-19 infections.


  Nevertheless, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Canada's deputy chief public health officer Dr. Howard Njoo and Quebec Premier Francois Legault were among those urging Canadians to step up efforts that could flatten the curve and allow for some modified festivities by Dec. 25.


  The warning followed weeks of unclear messages and confusing advice that likely played a role in cases now being linked to Thanksgiving weekend, says Toronto infectious diseases expert Dr. Andrew Morris, who stresses the importance of frank talk about the severity of the pandemic.


  "We need to be able to say when there's uncertainty but we also can't have comments like (Monday) at the provincial press conference, when the Ontario health minister said that there are some hints of things on a decline (in Ontario hot spots). That is very misleading information and all it does is it sows doubt in the public," says Morris, a physician at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.


  "Or even to suggest that we're still waiting to see the effect of our measures, (that) it's too early to tell, when I think everyone around us — most people — should recognize that things are still rising substantially."


  On Wednesday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford countered bleak outlooks on Christmas by noting "people get tired, but I've got to give them hope."

  Morris says it's unfair to impose a timeline on hoped-for victories, pointing to many uncertainties that make it hard to predict what infections will look like in December. He also questions how accurate Ontario's data was to begin with, noting he continues to hear about some people waiting days for a test -- a problem that would make it "near impossible" to get a handle on COVID-19's spread.


  But he doesn't expect much will change over the next two months.


  "Fast-forward six weeks, we're going to be seeing waves pretty substantially rising, if not cresting," Morris predicts.


  "I would be absolutely shocked if we aren't seeing really high peaks in six weeks' time."


  The colder temperatures and shorter days have coincided with mounting public frustration over months of economic, scholastic and social upheaval, which in recent weeks escalated to instances of outright defiance of public health directives.

After a relatively quiet decade, the Lusby town center could have some more construction in the works.


  During the Calvert County Planning Commission’s Oct. 21 meeting, the panel’s administrator, Paul Conover, presented an update for a proposed commercial development call The Shoppes at Town Square.


  The Lusby Town Center Master Plan and Zoning Ordinance was adopted in early 2002. The subsequent development of the south county area brought two grocery chains to Lusby along with restaurants and other retail shops.


  Along with a planned seven-unit shopping center, an all-but-forgotten road that stopped short of its anticipated distance is also back on the drawing board, although in a slightly different location.


  In a memo to the planning commission, Conover explained that “conceptually, within the Lusby Town Center Zoning Ordinance, there is to be a continuous road connection between Rousby Hall Road, HG Trueman Road and Town Square Drive, just south of the existing HG Trueman Road.”


  The road, Lusby Parkway, although identified in the Lusby Town Center Master Plan as “an important component and essential to the plan,” is in fact, a dead end road that ends abruptly to the east of the strip mall called Lusby Town Center. The parkway, along with a nearby “village green,” remain unfinished.


  “With the original alignment of Lusby Parkway no longer viable, an alternative route was proposed,” Conover stated. That alternative was presented to the planning commission last November by John Cosgrove, who is now the county’s public works’ deputy director of capital projects. At the time, the planning commission concurred that the alternative route, which would shift the parkway and connect it with Town Square Drive via Gunsmoke Trail, met the spirit of the town’s master plan and zoning ordinance.


  According to Conover’s memo, in analyzing the design of the parkway, public works staff “met representatives from the Chesapeake Ranch Estates property owners association. Their response to the proposal was generally favorable.”


  Conover stated the Oct. 21 presentation was “conceptual only” and more substantial details about the proposed new road “will be developed by a design consultant hired with a ‘Complete Streets’ grant awarded the county by the Metropolitan Planning Organization. County staff is in the process of selecting a consultant to begin the study.”


  Commission member Gregory Kernan requested that the panel be kept in the loop on the evolvement of the road plan.


  Dan Kelsh of Collinson, Oliff and Associates Inc. told the planning commission in a memo that developer Eric Chadwick purchased the commercially zoned property to the north of Lusby Town Center “early this year after completing an extensive feasibility analysis working closely with county staff over the previous year. COVD-19 soon drastically changed how commercial development will operate and move forward in the near and foreseeable future. Despite this hurdle, his vision for a neighborhood marketplace complementary to the existing commercial establishments and residential properties in the surrounding community remains intact.”


  Kelsh said Chadwick is ready to begin the process of identifying and contracting tenants for The Shoppes at Town Square. He added that the developer has also paid for traffic studies to gauge the impact the new shopping center will have on area traffic. The planned shopping center would be served by three main access points, including the extended parkway once it is built.


  Efforts by Southern Maryland News to contact Chadwick were not successful.

Point the finger elsewhere, not at our strikers!


  Why are we as fans so quick to criticise our strikers for not scoring when we lose? Over the last two games, we would be first to admit that our team has lacked on the goal front and failure to create chances.


  As soon as the matches finish, we fans and even pundits get on the bandwagon and begin pointing fingers at any player we can, mainly the strike force and the defence.


  I will also admit that I am one of those fans that can criticise players, but it is only because I know what their potential is and what they are capable of, and if they are not living up to that standard then of course they deserve to be criticised otherwise how will they learn. But I will never criticise a player if they don’t deserve it.


  The strikers are criticised for not scoring and the defence is criticised for conceding. But I think we should give the strikers a break because when you look at it from all angles the reality of it is that they simply cannot finish the chances if there are not any chances being thrown their way and they cannot be expected to run the whole show themselves and set up the goals for themselves too.


  Maybe the last two games we have played against Manchester City and Leicester City over the past week were not the best for any of our players, that was clear to see. But the front line cannot be blamed for the lack of goals and Arteta has to realise that the fault lies in midfield and he needs to rectify that.


  I back Aubameyang and Lacazette 100%, we all know the partnership they have on and off the pitch and when it works it really works!


  I have no doubt that our midfield will be fixed soon and the chances will come where they will create chance after chance for our strikers but the longer it takes for the creativity to kick in the further down the table we will fall, and in this era of football we cannot afford to do that!

In The News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Oct. 29, 2020 ...


  What we are watching in Canada ...


  OTTAWA —Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is speaking with the European Union's two top political leaders today and they are expected to discuss their shared commitment to international co-operation and what that means ahead of Tuesday's U.S presidential election.


  Today's three-way video conference between Trudeau, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Charles Michel, the European Union Council president, will mark the first formal discussion they have been able to hold since the changing of the guard of Europe's top political leadership late last year.


  In a pandemic-free world, it would have been a formal summit, a followup to last summer's two-day affair that Trudeau hosted with one of Von der Leyen and Michel's predecessors, Donald Tusk.


  That gathering was marked by gushing displays of Canada-EU political fealty that saw Trudeau and Tusk position themselves as defenders of a world order that has been increasingly under attack from U.S. President Donald Trump.


  Now, in the COVID-19 world, Trudeau, Von der Leyen and Michel are poised to send the same signal.


  A senior EU official in Brussels, who briefed The Canadian Press ahead of the talks on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, said the talks would affirm strong support for the United Nations World Health Organization.

  VANCOUVER — A border officer who assisted in the three-hour detention and examination of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou before her arrest at Vancouver's airport two years ago says collecting phone passcodes is routine during secondary examinations of foreign nationals.


  Scott Kirkland told the B.C. Supreme Court yesterday that if he realized at the time that the piece of paper where he wrote the passcodes on would be passed on to RCMP along with her devices, he would have acted immediately.


  He says he typically returns the piece of paper with passcodes to the foreign national as a reminder that they should change the codes after the examination.


  Kirkland is the second in a series of witnesses called to testify this week at the request of Meng's defence team, which is gathering evidence for arguments it will make next year that she was subjected to an abuse of process.


  The defence has alleged there was a "co-ordinated strategy" to have the RCMP delay her arrest so border officials could question Meng under the pretence of a routine immigration exam.


  The case is scheduled to continue today.

  In the Mississippi city of Waveland, Mayor Mike Smith said he was expecting to see a lot of damage in the morning.

Frankfurt am Main, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 29th Oct, 2020 ) :German auto giant Volkswagen said Thursday that, while its business was impacted heavily by the coronavirus pandemic this year, it managed to steer back to profit in the third quarter and still expected to end the year in the black.


  "The Volkswagen group's business was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic in the first nine months of 2020, but recovered noticeably in the third quarter," Europe's biggest car maker said in a statement.


  "This means that the declines in deliveries, sales revenue and profit as of the end of September were significantly more moderate than at the half-year mark." VW, whose brands include Porsche, Audi and Skoda, said that it booked net profit of 2.8 billion Euros ($3.2 billion) in the three months to September, compared with a loss of 1.5 billion euros in the preceding quarter.


  On a 12-month basis, third-quarter net profit was down by 31 percent.


  Underlying or operating profit fell by 30 percent year-on-year to 3.

The lesson? Even professionals have to vent or blow off steam in an unusual yet productive way. This unusual professional relationship is more often than not an unplanned, informal “Battle Royale” between two sides who have a worked together professionally and respectively for a long-time.

Of course, you could, if you're furious enough. But outside of cable news and Twitter, the sentiment I've heard expressed most often this campaign season isn't fury. It's exhaustion. People have grown sick of the omnipresence of politics, the endless debates, the apocalyptic premonitions. The stakes in this election are high, but for God's sake, they can't be _that_ high. For months now, analysts have surmised about an "exhausted majority," a cohort of relatively non-ideological voters who are fed up with the entire spectacle. They're said to be backing Biden, since Trump is the more tiring personality, though I know many on the right who feel the same way. The demands of 2020 engagement, with its 24-hour outrage spin cycle and shots of contempt right into the vein, simply aren't compatible with how most people live their lives, which is to say among the real and near and human.


  In Nathaniel Hawthorne's imperishable horror story _Young Goodman Brown_ , the titular character loses faith in everything—his church, his wife—after supposedly witnessing a satanic ritual in the woods. In the last line, Hawthorne says of Brown, "they carved no hopeful verse upon his tombstone; for his dying hour was gloom." It's because those next door _aren 't_ sinister devil worshippers that we may not yet go that way. And if we don't, it will be because we knew the neighbors weren't monsters all along; the real freaks were those who did nothing but salivate over a depressing and wretched election.

So it’s the first GNSS rover of its kind to enable measurement of points from images with survey-grade accuracy. Professionals can now map barriers that are difficult to reach physically, such as trenches, high-power lines and busy roads by simply taking a picture of the object. It will also work, thanks to its IMU module, in blocked areas where you’re blocked from GNSS signals.

They came so close.


   


  For 58 days, Major League Baseball avoided a positive coronavirus test among its hundreds of players. As the playoffs unfolded, the player pool shrank and its teams were shuffled into luxe isolation, the protocols and the logistics and the myriad sacrifices that went into staging this unprecedented season built a kind of momentum that made the whole operation seem invulnerable.


   


  And so it was - almost to the last out.


   


  What could have been a well-earned coda to an emotionally wrenching season for MLB  and its 2020 champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, instead ended with a pair of gut punches - one of them self-inflicted.


   


  Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner's positive test for the coronavirus, resulting in his abrupt removal from Game 6 of the World Series after seven innings, was a stunning development, given the relative isolation the players and their families have been in for most of the past month.


   


  Since the first week of October, the Dodgers have hardly budged from their 400-acre, suburban Dallas luxury accommodations, speaking glowingly of well- rounded continental breakfasts, team-bonding moments, even Clayton Kershaw enjoying the surreal wake-up call of rotation mate Walker Buehler chipping golf balls outside his door.


   


  And still a key subtext of this season - can MLB, with its billions of dollars in resources and access to bottomless and rapidly processed COVID-19 tests, keep its players safe from the virus? - suffered an unsettling blow at the 11th hour.


   


  It's hard to imagine how Turner - who turned up with one inconclusive and one positive test in 24 hours - contracted the virus while quarantined with his wife and teammates in a highly secured environment. Hopefully, we will find out, because nine months into this pandemic, we are still learning about this virus.


   


  If there was some greater good to MLB consuming more than 100,000 tests to get through 60 games and a postseason, it's that we could go to school on what worked and did not work as it shuttled its teams through a far less controlled environment than the NBA's unsullied slice of heaven in Orlando.


   


  Transparency is key. And that also includes a bit greater clarity on how and why Turner was allowed to leave a designated isolation room at Globe Life Field and join his teammates for the championship-clinching postgame celebration after his positive test was revealed.


   


  A handful of teammates and club president Andrew Friedman offered myriad and largely lame explanations for a jarring visual --Turner, sometimes masked, sometimes not, mugging for the team photo and hugging teammates.


   


  Friedman leaned on the fact that Turner was largely surrounded by teammates with whom he was quarantining or had been in contact with. The team will have multiple rounds of testing before leaving Texas.


   


  Yet, an on-field post-championship celebration is not a bubble. There are photographers and camera crews and league officials, not all of them locked down with the Dodgers. The threat of infecting a teammate or teammate's family member was real.


   


  What's more, there are millions of people watching on television, all having just learned of Turner's positive test, only to see him mingling and mugging. For the millions who have been locked down, distanced, unable to access testing or see loved ones, it was a galling image.


   


  Hey, the circumstances are terrible, especially for a franchise pillar. It's heartbreaking to ponder Turner stuck in isolation while his teammates celebrate the greatest professional achievement of their lives.


   


  But the more than 226,000 Americans killed by this virus, the many more with permanent damage and the psychological and economic ramifications of COVID-19 are far worse. This is a pandemic, not the last day of school, certainly not the time for adults to look the other way while the kids flout a few rules.


   


  It's not like stars have never been deprived of a championship celebration. Cincinnati Reds great Eric Davis was hospitalized with a lacerated kidney suffered in the early innings Game 4 of the 1990 World Series. His championship ring is just as shiny.


   


  It is weird to consider the season finally over -- a year that began with an industry shutdown, followed by a labor fight, followed by dozens of positive COVID-19 tests during summer intake, and the devastating outbreaks suffered by the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals that threatened the season before it fully got off the ground.


   


  Significant mistakes were made. There were times it seemed commissioner Rob Manfred - who said he's "not a quitter" when the Cardinals' season teetered - would plow through to the finish regardless of decimated teams or the magnitude of the virus in the 27 markets that allowed MLB to play.


   


  But also, errors were corrected. Protocols were tightened. Staying safe became a symbol of being a good teammate, to the point the Cleveland Indians possibly cost themselves a division title when they punished two pitchers -- and traded one -- after they stepped out on the town.


   


  It felt like a lot of that good was betrayed in the waning moments before the league scattered for the offseason. If nothing else, it served as a reminder of what's in store in 2021.


   


  Baseball will be back. The coronavirus will be, too. Act accordingly.

However, he continued to run and is now urging people to write in his name on the ballots. The Kardashians remained silent on the subject, which angered the many begging people not to vote for Kanye and take this election seriously.

His belief that the US government isn’t handling the war well is only heightened when he contributes to what would later be called the Pentagon Papers, a study of classified documents commissioned by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood). Knowing that the papers contain explosive revelations, including secrets regarding the winnability of the war that were kept from the American people, Ellsberg eventually copied them and worked to get them into the hands of the New York Times.”

Vista will ship with its own controller, a fairly simple-looking affair with a pair of thumbsticks and a touch screen. It's probably unrealistic to wish for a user interface as tight and clean as you'd find on a DJI drone, but that can be forgiven in light of this drone's 360-degree capabilities. We're interested to learn what you can see onscreen when you're flying this thing, and how it might differ from a traditional single-camera drone.


  We wouldn't expect a 1080p zoomed crop of an 8K video image constructed from two ultra-wide fisheye views to give you the kind of video quality you'd get with a single camera that's dedicated to shooting in the same field of vision you'll be watching in, but some of the company's demo videos don't look bad.


  Could you get the bulk of this thing's utility by strapping a regular 360-degree camera to any old drone? Well, sort of; I can't see how you'd be able to eliminate the drone in the stitched image, so anyone looking around in VR is going to see a great big airframe sitting on top of their heads. There's nothing particularly magical in the way Door Robotics is packaging the Vista; it seems reasonable to expect 360-degree camera drones like this will become a thing. Heck, we're kinda surprised DJI or Insta360 or the like don't already have one out there.


  They may even at some stage make more sense than regular camera drones, since as long as they can see an object they can film it, and they'll let you compose your shot in post production, opening up some wild effects. But to get to that point, they'll need a pretty significant leap in image quality and you'll need some chops with some 360-degree video editing software.


  Door Robotics is crowdfunding the Vista on Kickstarter for an early bird "50 percent off" pledge of US$1,199 for one chromed-out drone and a controller, with deliveries slated for April next year. It's already nailed its target three times over, so the project is going ahead – but all the standard crowdfunding warnings apply. Indeed, one of the only other integrated 360-degree camera drones we can find appears to have been an Indiegogo crowdfunded device back in 2016 that never delivered.

I enjoy grilling… a lot. I had always come up with my own concoctions to ensure that whomever ate my food — their taste-buds would always be tingling! I am a big seasoning and sauce guy. Always have been, always will be. I started filming a foodie series years ago while on tour signing at comic cons. That being said, I am always thinking of what the next possible ‘natural’ progression is in anything I do — my own sauce and seasoning line was definitely on the list. Now, to make a long story longer… when I was touring, I would continuously be seeking out the local hot sauce places to see if I could locate a hotter, higher Scoville sauce for my pal Ron ‘Bumblefoot’ Thal. It became an obsession. For awhile, I couldn’t find anything that was hotter than what he’d already tried. That is until I hit the North Market in Columbus, Ohio. I stumbled upon a place called CaJohn’s Fiery Foods and although they didn’t have anything in-house — I was assured that the owner, John Hard would certainly have something that would take it to the next level. Little did I know that John is considered the Godfather of hot sauce! I received a call back directly from John and as we were discussing what he had that would knock Ron’s socks off — my ‘ah ha’ moment occurred and I asked if he would be interested in working with Ron and I to develop our own lines of sauces and seasonings… to which he agreed. The rest is history.

I’m a firm believer in doing it yourself and ensuring you get the lion’s share of reaping all the benefits — this of course also means that you take on all the loss as well. I have personally raised the capital on my own to put forth new products into the world; or partnered with established corporations to make it happen. I started an entire comic book company with a total of a $100 initial investment and built it from there — so anything is possible! Other people may find that taking out loans, borrowing money or seeking investors is the way to go — I just don’t like the idea of going into a situation so far behind the eight ball that it’s hard to dig yourself out of the debt. Especially when it is for an unproven asset. Perhaps consider starting small and once your product has a proven track record (even if that record is not enormous), then seek out investors and capital to take your business to the next level.

I wouldn't be surprised if there was more of a measured or phased policy as otherwise we could go from feast to famine. Are you seeing many sales fall through at the moment? What kinds of things are causing this to happen if so? No real pattern, although we have seen a few buyers get over- enthusiastic on offers. They get their ambitions mixed up with their capabilities and have rescinded offers, disappointing the seller and also the agent. What kinds of things are holding up sales at the moment? Are more mistakes happening because everyone's so busy? The huge increase in volume of sales is unprecedented over such a short period of time, and this is holding up sales. There is a huge strain on lenders, surveyors, removalists and solicitors. Mistakes are inevitable with additional workloads and it is proving very hard ensuring all the ducks are in the row for exchange. As an example, we had a chain of five ready to exchange today but one party inexplicably hadn't booked a removal firm with lack of communication; the whole process is then put on hold and now we may need to agree a new completion date. If instructed to sell a plot of land with planning permission for one house, what chance these days does a self-builder have of acquiring the plot? The selling agent will likely earn a further fee by being instructed on the sale of any new house by a developer... We have recently been instructed on a plot with planning permission for a three bedroom house for a client and we are offering it to end users\/self-builders and developers alike as we are duty bound to present the best possible deal to our client. Some developers would prefer a plot without planning permission as once it has been granted it can take the financial margin out of the equation, increasing the self-builder's opportunity. Granted, the developer would instruct the agent on the resale but developers can give the owner more financial and know-how certainty. Self-builders may struggle with finances as new build mortgages are more complex and, in my experience, can get cold feet with escalating build costs and naivety.

After spending an approximate £55, 000 on renovations, including a pink marble bathroom and walk-in wardrobe, it's clear that TOWIE star Jess has increased the value of her Essex home.


  The reality star, engaged to business owner William Lee-Kemp, purchased the Chigwell property for around £1.25 million back in 2015.


  It's thought these additions could add anywhere between 4-8 per cent of the value, meaning it's likely Jess's house is now worth around £1.3 million - £1.5 million.


  This means Jess is likely to have only broken even on her renovations, with estate experts adding that the bathroom renovation is probably the biggest influence on the house value.

Co-working major WeWork will focus on achieving profitable growth globally, including in India, in 2021 by increasing the occupancy level of its real estate portfolio, the companys CEO Sandeep Mathrani said. Further, Softbank backed-WeWork will revisit its plan to launch an initial public issue IPO only after it becomes profitable, said Mathrani, who became the new CEO in February after the exit of WeWork co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann. In a video conference, Mathrani said India is an important market for the US-based firm and has recently invested USD 100 million in WeWork India. WeWork Indias contribution to global revenue is currently small but it will continue to rise as the country has great potential for flexible workspace business, Mathrani said. Asked about WeWorkrsquos top priorities for India, he said the global strategy is to achieve profitable growth through increase in occupancy level at all its centres. Our priority everywhere globally is profitable growth and streamlining our organisation and real estate portfolio in 2020,rdquo he said, adding that in 2021, the company plans go towards having profitable growth and become EBIDTA positive. Mathrani said the company has been able to reduce operating cost and cash burn significantly this year by streamlining the organisation and also its real estate portfolio. The exercise of right-sizing organisations has been completed, while the streamlining of real estate portfolio is also 75 per cent complete, he added. Mathrani said 65-70 per cent occupancy level is required for break even, which the company had achieved before the outbreak of COVID-19. He noted that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of de-densification of office space and adoption of hub and spoke model. He felt that India would benefit from this because of cost advantage. Mathrani described the WeWork global investment of USD 100 million as a ldquostrategic moverdquo that shows its commitment to the Indian market. He mentioned that WeWork has sold its investment in its China business. Asked whether the company has any plan to relaunch its public offer, Mathrani said the company is currently targeting to achieve profitable growth and positive cash flow, and then will decide the path forward. I am a big believer of we take one step at a time, we show profitable growth and then decide what the path forward is. Get to the cash flow positive and then decide, Mathrani said

In the end, Chanute succumbed 9-0 to Louisburg, which prevented CHS from potentially advancing farther than they’ve ever gone in the program’s history, which is still the regional championship game versus Augusta last year.


  CHS head coach Adam Wilcox has been preaching all year that a team can play well in a loss, but can also play badly in a win. Playing in frigid temperatures for the second straight day, Wilcox thought his team improved dramatically against a very talented Louisburg team.


  “Everything has improved. Every single aspect of our game has improved from August to now, from Drayton’s (goalie Cleaver) play in the back to the back line playing as a unit to midfield playing small, short balls, to strikers buying space, literally everything is better now than in August,” Wilcox said. “I know it didn’t look good today. But I can honestly say we didn’t play bad. We played fairly well. And sometimes you don’t do anything wrong, and you still lose. And that’s just life.


  “This was a really good team. They’re the kind of team that we want to be. The way they play, that’s our goal. They’re just a really good team. There’s an own goal. There was a handball on the 18, so just little mistakes. But if we don’t make those, that’s not what kept us from victory today. It was just running up against a really good team. I think they might be better than Rose Hill. They’re on par, and Rose Hill is consistently great. They just looked outstanding. They’re well-coached. They’re smart. Their kids are all over the place. They have great touches. That’s just an ideal program right there.”


  In an effort to combat Louisburg’s onslaught, Wilcox facilitated a game plan similar to the one executed in Coffeyville on Oct. 22, a game in which the Blue Comets lost 1-0. Chanute wanted to possess the ball as much as they could in the back, play with intensity, and try to score a goal on a counter attack.


  Having a full slate of players would help this strategy, but Chanute all year has been having players in and out of the lineup due to injury, cramps or quarantining. The only player missing from Chanute’s lineup Tuesday was junior midfielder Trey Smoot, who is with his family vacationing.


  Taking advantage of his relatively healthy lineup, Wilcox used his traditional rotation of senior forward Andrea Cuin, sophomore forward Kaia Barkman and freshman forward Lucio Soliz. Barkman was noticeably the best player in the first half, challenging every ball.

Pakistan's state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.


  Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.


  The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June. Khan's decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.


  Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple's construction with force, raising tensions. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple's construction.


  It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council's ruling. However, the council's ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.


  Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple's construction.


  Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don't use it for fear of attacks.


  About 3,000 Hindus live in Islamabad with its population of more than 1 million, mostly Muslims.


  Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, but there have been incidents in which Hindu girls were forcibly converted to Islam.


  Most of the country's Hindus migrated to India from present day Pakistan in 1947 when India was divided by Britain's government. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India have a history of bitter relations. They have fought three wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety.

It is truly mind over matter. The reason many people do not move forward with their ideas is because they are afraid to fail. Failure is not something to be afraid of — it should motivate you to be and do better! If people fleshed out their ideas fully — rather than flying by the seat of their pants (which I am certainly guilty of myself at times), they would find that they could essentially bring their dream to fruition. Most people have an idea and never put it to paper, while others talk about it until they’re blue in the face; but never do anything about it. Develop a business plan — be a student of the industry you are seeking to develop in and learn. It will either inspire you to move forward; or not. Unfortunately, there is no real way to help anyone past this hurdle as it is all about motivation and work ethic. You can have work ethic; but not be motivated and vice versa — I do think everyone should try though!

Covid: Jojob, carpooling supporto a trasporto pubblico

"


  They came so close.


  For 58 days, Major League Baseball avoided a positive coronavirus test among its hundreds of players. As the playoffs unfolded, the player pool shrank and its teams were shuffled into luxe isolation, the protocols and the logistics and the myriad sacrifices that went into staging this unprecedented season built a kind of momentum that made the whole operation seem invulnerable.


  And so it was - almost to the last out.


  What could have been a well-earned coda to an emotionally wrenching season for MLB and its 2020 champions, the Los Angeles Dodgers, instead ended with a pair of gut punches - one of them self-inflicted.


  Dodgers third baseman Justin Turner's positive test for the coronavirus, resulting in his abrupt removal from Game 6 of the World Series after seven innings, was a stunning development, given the relative isolation the players and their families have been in for most of the past month.


  Since the first week of October, the Dodgers have hardly budged from their 400-acre, suburban Dallas luxury accommodations, speaking glowingly of well- rounded continental breakfasts, team-bonding moments, even Clayton Kershaw enjoying the surreal wake-up call of rotation mate Walker Buehler chipping golf balls outside his door.


  And still a key subtext of this season - can MLB, with its billions of dollars in resources and access to bottomless and rapidly processed COVID-19 tests, keep its players safe from the virus? - suffered an unsettling blow at the 11th hour.


  It's hard to imagine how Turner - who turned up with one inconclusive and one positive test in 24 hours - contracted the virus while quarantined with his wife and teammates in a highly secured environment. Hopefully, we will find out, because nine months into this pandemic, we are still learning about this virus.


  If there was some greater good to MLB consuming more than 100,000 tests to get through 60 games and a postseason, it's that we could go to school on what worked and did not work as it shuttled its teams through a far less controlled environment than the NBA's unsullied slice of heaven in Orlando.


  Transparency is key. And that also includes a bit greater clarity on how and why Turner was allowed to leave a designated isolation room at Globe Life Field and join his teammates for the championship-clinching postgame celebration after his positive test was revealed.


  A handful of teammates and club president Andrew Friedman offered myriad and largely lame explanations for a jarring visual --Turner, sometimes masked, sometimes not, mugging for the team photo and hugging teammates.


  Friedman leaned on the fact that Turner was largely surrounded by teammates with whom he was quarantining or had been in contact with. The team will have multiple rounds of testing before leaving Texas.


  Yet, an on-field post-championship celebration is not a bubble. There are photographers and camera crews and league officials, not all of them locked down with the Dodgers. The threat of infecting a teammate or teammate's family member was real.


  What's more, there are millions of people watching on television, all having just learned of Turner's positive test, only to see him mingling and mugging. For the millions who have been locked down, distanced, unable to access testing or see loved ones, it was a galling image.


  Hey, the circumstances are terrible, especially for a franchise pillar. It's heartbreaking to ponder Turner stuck in isolation while his teammates celebrate the greatest professional achievement of their lives.


  But the more than 226,000 Americans killed by this virus, the many more with permanent damage and the psychological and economic ramifications of COVID-19 are far worse. This is a pandemic, not the last day of school, certainly not the time for adults to look the other way while the kids flout a few rules.


  It's not like stars have never been deprived of a championship celebration. Cincinnati Reds great Eric Davis was hospitalized with a lacerated kidney suffered in the early innings Game 4 of the 1990 World Series. His championship ring is just as shiny.


  It is weird to consider the season finally over -- a year that began with an industry shutdown, followed by a labor fight, followed by dozens of positive COVID-19 tests during summer intake, and the devastating outbreaks suffered by the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals that threatened the season before it fully got off the ground.


  Significant mistakes were made. There were times it seemed commissioner Rob Manfred - who said he's \"not a quitter\" when the Cardinals' season teetered - would plow through to the finish regardless of decimated teams or the magnitude of the virus in the 27 markets that allowed MLB to play.


  But also, errors were corrected. Protocols were tightened. Staying safe became a symbol of being a good teammate, to the point the Cleveland Indians possibly cost themselves a division title when they punished two pitchers -- and traded one -- after they stepped out on the town.


  It felt like a lot of that good was betrayed in the waning moments before the league scattered for the offseason. If nothing else, it served as a reminder of what's in store in 2021.


  Baseball will be back. The coronavirus will be, too. Act accordingly.

Va detto che nella serata di Champions League contro il Barcellona, al di la del rigore nel finale cauato da Bernardeschi e stata la prestazione di squadra della Juventus a deludere. A parte lo sfortunato Morata e qualche spunto di Chiesa, in attacco la Juve ha prodotto poco. Dybala, certamente non al top della condizione per i tanti problemi fisici delle scorse settimane, ha inciso poco e perso la sfida a distanza con Messi. Kulusevski non e riuscito a trovare le accelerazioni che lo avevano reso imprendibile in campionato. E a centrocampo ha steccato il duo Bentancur-Rabiot. Senza dimenticare la serata nera di Demiral (che ha chiuso un match in difficolta con l'espulsione al 40° del secondo tempo).

For months, the governments in England, Wales and Scotland have pulled apart in their responses to curbing the spread of Covid-19.


  Prime Minister Boris Johnson broke ranks in green lighting an easing of England's draconian lockdown measures in July, which saw pubs and restaurants re-opened.


  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster have since opted to forge their own routes out of the unprecedented battle with the virus.


  But with just over eight weeks until Christmas Day and the nation in the grips of a brutal second wave, all of the UK is on course for a drastically different festive period.


  As Wales was thrust into a circuit breaker lockdown, experts are warning all of England must be placed into Tier 3 - raising further questions about traveling between borders and mixing households.

Whatever the reasons, clearly heightened by the coronavirus pandemic, since Trump took office in 2017, I have been slightly on edge. One thing I ask of Joe Biden is to forgo a Twitter account. We know the government cannot be run by tweet. Trump has the mindset of a dictator believing whatever he says is law. He acts as he did when he ran his own company into the ground only now it’s our country he is running into the ground.

The decision to hold policy despite the heightened uncertainty likely reflects continued signs of a recovery in Japan from its record contraction as production and exports improve. The central bank also has little extra fire power to stimulate the economy, with an extension of its existing virus- response measures seen by many economists as its most likely next move.
 ​The BOJ’s ramped-up asset buying has helped keep markets relatively stable while around ¥110 trillion in loan programs has ensured struggling firms can access credit rather than going bust. The measures are currently set to expire at the end of March, having already been extended by six months.
 "I’m not sure if the BOJ really needed to cut its 2020 GDP forecast this much. Monthly data suggest growth won’t be terrible from here,” said Yoshimasa Maruyama, economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. An extension of the lending programs will be the likely focus of any further moves, he said.
 "A deeper negative rate is out of the question when the financial system is hurting more during a slump,” he added.
 "While the reflation effort is on the back burner for now, the central bank continues to face serious challenges, with the economy still struggling from the virus impact and recent readings on core inflation below zero,” Bloomberg economist Yuki Masujima said.
 While Japan has had far fewer virus cases than many other developed countries, the surge in Europe and the U.S. casts a shadow over the outlook, despite the relative success of policy makers in propping up the economy. The number of bankruptcies is actually down from last year and the jobless rate has remained low at 3% for now.
 On inflation, the bank trimmed its forecast for this fiscal year, citing the impact of government-sponsored discounts on travel packages to help regional economies and the tourism industry.
 Inflation is running far below the BOJ’s 2% target, but the bank’s priorities now are keeping credit lines open to companies and maintaining market stability. The BOJ said the government’s travel subsidies was a factor behind the lowering of its price forecast for this fiscal year, citing a likely 0.2 percentage point downward impact on this year’s inflation data.
 "What’s missing here is a discussion over how they are going to achieve the price target,” said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG and a former BOJ official. He also flagged the possibility of trouble ahead if the yen continues to appreciate given the BOJ’s lack of additional policy tools.

"The failure of the Trump administration has been to go it alone. And that has given China an escape hatch,” said Jeffrey Prescott, a former senior foreign policy in the Obama administration.
 The advisers declined to say whether the Democratic presidential candidate would be inclined toward lifting the massive tariffs on China that Trump has used to fuel a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
 "He’s not going to lock into any premature position before we see exactly what we're inheriting,” Prescott said. "But consulting with allies is going to be a central part of that.”
 The bitter trade dispute is just one of the main sources of tensions between Washington and Beijing, whose relations have sunk to the lowest point in decades over a range of issues, including the coronavirus, Hong Kong, intellectual property theft, human rights, Taiwan and the South China Sea.
 China has been a central foreign policy focus in the 2020 presidential campaign. In political rallies, Trump has often claimed that Biden would take a softer approach to China.
 Biden has struck back, saying he would be tougher on China than Trump and not afraid to use trade barriers — but only when they make sense. For instance, he told the United Steelworkers union in May that steel and aluminum tariffs would stay until a global solution to limit excess production — largely centered in China — can be negotiated.
 Trump and his aides argue, without evidence, that China itself is paying the U.S. tariffs. Trump says a Phase 1 trade deal signed with China in January was a big step forward, but experts say Beijing’s total purchases of U.S. goods will fall far short of the targets set for the first year of the accord.
 The series of staggered tariffs the Trump administration imposed on $370 billion worth of Chinese goods in 2018 and 2019 have cost U.S. importers more than $60 billion, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, and have been blamed for eroding U.S. manufacturing competitiveness.
 But due to the political sensitivities of easing U.S. pressure on China, questions remain about the prospect that Biden will act swiftly to decrease tariffs if he is elected.
 Biden’s advisers made clear that he would first want to confer with U.S. allies instead of taking unilateral action on trade action the way Trump did.
 "You can start by not slapping tariffs on the Europeans and the Canadians and instead work with them on the trade issue,” said Brian McKeon, a former White House and Pentagon adviser in the Obama administration.
 Immediate consultation would be needed "to identify areas where we can bring collective leverage on China," Prescott said. "But they've been alienated, they've been insulted by President Trump, and that’s made our hand with China even weaker than it should be."

He doesnt offer the team anything going forward plays so deep you would be forgiven if you thought he was playing midfield, he makes no runs no movement at all and doesnt close anything down.

Hurricane Zeta made landfall in Louisiana Wednesday night, and has weakened to a Tropical Storm. The storm track pushes right over the NC/TN line throughout the day today, bringing widespread concern for rain, wind, and severe storms.


  The worst of the weather comes this morning through midday, with temperatures in the 70s. Expect very heavy rain and the possibility of damaging winds. Our area will see 1 to 5 inches of rain with the possibility of flooding, especially in the mountains, with a Flash Flood Watch in place. Winds with the system will gust 30 to 50 mph across the area from Thursday morning into the afternoon, with trees falling and power outages possible. It'll begin to dry out and cool down Thursday night.

After spending an approximate £55, 000 on renovations, including a pink marble bathroom and walk-in wardrobe, it's clear that TOWIE star Jess has increased the value of her Essex home.
 The reality star, engaged to business owner William Lee-Kemp, purchased the Chigwell property for around £1.25 million back in 2015.
 It's thought these additions could add anywhere between 4-8 per cent of the value, meaning it's likely Jess's house is now worth around £1.3 million - £1.5 million.
 This means Jess is likely to have only broken even on her renovations, with estate experts adding that the bathroom renovation is probably the biggest influence on the house value.

"Dialing 911 will accelerate a response by emergency personnel, most often police," she says. "This option should be used for extreme crisis situations that require immediate intervention. These first responders may or may not be appropriately trained and experienced in de-escalating psychiatric emergencies."


  The National Alliance on Mental Illness continues to advocate for more resources for families dealing with a mental health crisis. The group says more cities should create crisis response teams that can respond at all hours, without involving armed police officers in most situations.


  There has been progress on the federal level, as well. Kimball was happy when President Trump signed a bipartisan Congressional bill, on Oct. 17, to implement a three-digit national suicide prevention hotline. The number — 988 — will eventually summon help when dialed anywhere in the country. But it could take a few years before the system is up and running.


  Rulennis Muñoz says the family never got to see how Ricardo would have responded to someone other than a police officer.


  "And instead of a cop just being there, there should have been other responders," Rulennis says. "There should have been someone that knew how to deal with this type of situation."

But Koremura from Riskbenefit says the spike in demand caused by the pandemic hasn’t all been good for the industry. The boom, he says, has given rise to profiteering by some cleanup companies, seeking to rake in profits with shoddy services he says fall woefully short of proper disinfection.
 Wataru Kawasaki, a board member of the Crime Scene Special Clean Center, says he is aware of some cases in which businesses have deceptively advertised themselves on their websites as more expert than they actually are in relation to COVID-19 disinfection, in hope of attracting more clients.
 The way Koremura sees it, the pandemic has shed renewed light on a darker side of the industry.
 “Our cleanup services cater primarily to people in trouble, which is precisely what gives me a sense of purpose and mission. But at the same time, there is always this lot who seeks to exploit them and ‘fish in troubled waters,’ so to speak,” Koremura said.
 In fact, ridding the industry of unscrupulous businesses has been Koremura’s career-long ambition, which was strengthened anew three years ago when he nearly succumbed to a heart attack.
 The narrow escape from death gave him a perspective on his life, making him strive all the harder to leave his two-year-old daughter a legacy she can be proud of in the future.
 “I would hate to imagine my daughter growing up and one day being told what I do for a living, only to respond, ‘Hey, isn’t that the industry full of all these con men?,’” he said.
 “Instead, I want her to think of me as someone who steered an industry that had helped a number of people in trouble.”

Manitoba's premier and chief provincial public health officer this week delivered blistering rebukes of infected people brazenly disobeying containment rules, while a coalition of Quebec gym owners initially threatened to defy extended lockdown measures before vowing Wednesday to protest instead.


  Trudeau acknowledged frustrations while cautioning the nation that "unless we're really, really careful, there may not be the kinds of family gatherings we want to have at Christmas."


  And while Legault recognized the "vast majority" of Quebecers have complied with public health guidance, he said it was "not enough" and that "big parties for Christmas" were unlikely.


  In order for public health measures to hit home, the advice must be clear and consistent, and politicians should be transparent about their rationale for social restrictions, says infectious disease epidemiologist Ashleigh Tuite.


  She says it's far more helpful to offer concrete examples of what people should do, than admonish them for what they should not do.


  "The reality is we know that people are going to bend the rules a little bit. First of all, give people creative ideas of how they might celebrate the holidays," says Tuite, a University of Toronto professor who especially wanted holiday travel guidance for university students living away from home.


  Still, Tuite says tapping into shared hopes can be a powerful motivator to keep people committed to COVID-19 sacrifices: "We need something to look forward to."


  Many of the holiday season's highlights have already been scrapped or are unlikely to take place, including bustling Christmas markets, Santa Claus parades, mall photos with Santa, blockbuster movie releases, and holiday concerts and performances.


  But that doesn't mean Christmas is cancelled, says health economist and policy analyst Peter Berman of the University of British Columbia, who suggests a near-normal celebration might be possible in the least-impacted regions.


  In the same way many Canadians found ways to celebrate a scaled-back Thanksgiving and are now modifying their Halloween fun, Berman encourages people to focus on accepting a new reality -- one he expects will curtail social gatherings well into the new year.


  "We should probably turn our attention not so much to lamenting that we won't have the Christmas we're all used to, but rather thinking, 'How can we make the best of enjoying the one we're going to have together?'" says Berman.

First thing I would like to say is make sure that you are 200% ready to take on everything that comes next. Developing a product and a brand is similar to raising a child — it has needs, costs a lot of money and requires daily attention at all stages of the game. I would suggest that you put it all on paper — flesh out your idea before moving forward. Develop a preliminary marketing plan and research the current market. Find out what other companies big and small have done in the past — what was successful and what was not… learn from their wins and losses! Seek out the advice of reputable people in the industry — one thing that I can assure you is that everyone has one thing in common — they like to talk about themselves and their successes. Invest in visiting food conferences and speaking with people who are already doing it. Seek out distribution in advance — know the market and who has a strong grasp on it. Ensure that you know all the legalities of putting your product out to market, be safe not sorry. If your item(s) requires co-packing — make sure you are dealing with a reputable source who will put your brand out into the world as if it were their own.

Pakistan's state-run council of clerics, which advises the government on religious issues, gave its approval Wednesday to the construction of a new temple for minority Hindus, ruling Islamic law allows them a place of worship.Lal Malhi, a prominent Hindu leader who is also a member of parliament, applauded the ruling but noted the council also recommended the government not spend public funds directly on the construction of private places of worship.The decision by the Council of Islamic Ideology comes after the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan abruptly halted construction on the temple in the capital Islamabad in June. Khan's decision came amid threats from radical Muslims who called construction of the temple a blasphemous act.Some extremists had vowed to try to stop the temple's construction with force, raising tensions. Khan turned to the council to decide if public money could be used for construction. He had promised $600,000 for the temple's construction.It was not immediately clear Wednesday whether Khan would follow through with providing the funds in light of the council's ruling. However, the council's ruling left open the possibility the money could be distributed to the Hindu community to use as it sees fit.Khan, who has promised equal rights for minorities, is expected to issue a formal order to allow the temple's construction.Currently, there is no functioning temple for Hindus in Islamabad. An ancient temple exists in the capital, but Hindus don't use it for fear of attacks.About 3,000 Hindus live in Islamabad with its population of more than 1 million, mostly Muslims.Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, but there have been incidents in which Hindu girls were forcibly converted to Islam.Most of the country's Hindus migrated to India from present day Pakistan in 1947 when India was divided by Britain's government. Nuclear-armed rivals Pakistan and India have a history of bitter relations. They have fought three wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is split between them but claimed by both in its entirety.

Berlin [Germany], October 29 (ANI): German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday (local time) announced to begin a 'lockdown light' from November 2 amid a surge in COVID-19 cases.   The measures are intended to limit contact as much as possible and stem the rapid spread of the virus, reported Euro News.   "We must act, and now, to avoid an acute national health emergency. If infections continue at this rate, we will be at the limits of the capacities of our health system," said the chancellor at a press conference, adding that schools and nurseries would remain open.   The new lockdown norms were announced due to a surge in the virus infection rate that went over a threshold of 50 per 100,000 inhabitants in one week. The German government along with the country's 16 state premiers has decided to close restaurants and pubs throughout November, along with cinemas, trade fairs, theatres, and fitness centres.  


  The move is going to affect the sports too as all professional sports competitions in Germany, including top-level football, will be held behind closed doors from Monday and amateur sports activities will not be allowed, reported Euro News.   "No more than ten people should convene at one time and contact is set to be limited to two households," said Merkel.   The recent measures have created anger amongst Germany's hospitality industry, already overburdened due to the coronavirus pandemic staged a protest at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate to demand financial support from the government.   Meanwhile, the government has announced Euro 10 billion in additional emergency aid to help those who have been financially impacted by the pandemic.   Germany's new daily infections hit its highest total yet on Wednesday at over 14,000, with just 25 per cent of the country's intensive care beds available reported Euro News. (ANI)

HANOI, Vietnam - Typhoon Molave set off landslides that killed at least 19 people and left 45 missing in central Vietnam, where ferocious wind and rain blew away roofs and knocked out power in a region of 1.7 million residents, state media said Thursday.


  The casualties from the landslides bring the over-all death toll from the storm to at least 35, including 12 fishermen whose boats sank Wednesday as the typhoon approached with winds of up to 150 kilometres (93 miles) per hour. Vietnamese officials say it’s the worst typhoon to hit the country in 20 years.


  At least 59 people remain missing in the landslides and at sea. The toll may rise with many regions still unable to report details of the devastation amid the stormy weather.


  Rescuers dug up eight bodies Thursday morning in Tra Van village in south central Quang Nam province where a hillside collapsed on houses. The victims had taken shelter in the community as the typhoon approached, the official Vietnam News Agency reported.


  In Tra Leng village, about 45 kilometres (28 miles) from Tra Van, another landslide buried a community with several houses occupied by about 45 people. Four managed to escape. Rescuers have recovered eight bodies and were scrambling to save 37 others, Vietnam News said.


  Tra Leng remains inaccessible due to damaged roads and other landslides and government disaster-response teams were using bulldozers and excavators to open up a road to bring in more rescuers and heavy equipment.


  Deputy Prime Minister Trinh Dinh Dung travelled to the site where soldiers were clearing up a landslide with bulldozers and ordered officers to urgently bring in troops to the landslide-hit village.


  “We must reach the landslide site the fastest way. First, send in more soldiers before we can get the big machine there. We have to reach the area by all means, including by using helicopters,” he said.


  As troops scrambled to rescue those buried alive in Tra Leng, another part of a rain-soaked mountainside cascaded down in a torrent of mud in nearby Phuoc Loc district Thursday morning, trapping 11 people. Three bodies were pulled out immediately by villagers, Vietnam News said.

Many of Harry's old friends said that the evening guest list was the Prince and his bride's way of saying, 'These are the people we want in our lives moving forward.'"

But as you can see above, that wording isn’t on the ballot. In its place G-20 states “by extending voter-approved funding at a 1.5 cent rate . . .” That’s nebulous at best, and it removes the only clue a voter might have that G-20 is a tax. In fact, it tells us nothing and begs the question what “voter-approved funding?”

WARREN GATLAND says age will not be a barrier to Johnny Sexton’s selection on a third Lions tour to South Africa next summer. However, the coach challenged the Ireland captain to prove that his body can stand up to the demands of the trip over the course of the next couple of months.Sexton will turn 36 before the Test series against the world champions gets under way, but retains the faith of the management of his club and country and has been in impressive form since coming out of lockdown.The experienced out-half started five of the last six Lions Tests, coming off the bench in the other, and he has long held making the plane as a key ambition to achieve at this late stage of his career.And, with Gatland prizing prior experience given the lack of preparation time and name-checking the Ireland skipper as well as James Ryan and Conor Murray as potential Lions captains, he is definitely in the frame.&quot;No, it's not about the future, it's about the here and now,&quot; Gatland said.&quot;For Johnny, he's managed himself really well and this autumn is going to be about what Ireland do in terms of that. Then, obviously, the Six Nations... probably, the last year or so, his biggest challenge has been to string a number of games together.&quot;He's picked up some niggles and knocks, a few head knocks as well and stuff... that's kind of (it) from where we'll be looking at it.&ldquo;There's no doubt about him in terms of his experience and leadership and the quality of him as a player.&quot;He's someone who I look back on in 2017, he didn't have the greatest start to the tour and then he came back and that's what world class players do. Their form can sometimes go, but they're able to.... what do they say? Form is temporary and class is permanent.&quot;Again, it's just looking and seeing how Johnny goes over the next six months or so.&quot;That's the important factor, for him holding his body together and how he manages it.&quot;If he is selected, how he is managed on tour as well.&quot;Gatland is putting together his backroom team at the moment and will meet with IRFU chiefs in the coming weeks to discuss Andy Farrell&rsquo;s availability for the tour.The Ireland coach was an influential part of the winning coaching staff in Australia in 2013 and again when the Lions tied the series in New Zealand in 2017.Having been promoted to the top job and with Ireland supposed to be on tour in the Pacific next summer, the Irish union may not be too keen on him going for a third series.However, Gatland believes the positives outweigh the negatives.&quot;When you're picking your coaching team, I have found the most important thing for us from a Lions perspective is that because you have such a limited preparation time and you're bringing a new group of players together and trying to do things as quickly as you possibly can having that continuity of people who have been there before - whether that's from a coaching perspective, strength and conditioning, medical or analysis. It makes a big difference,&rdquo; he said.&quot;But, you want some new faces as well and that's important and we've done that on previous tours.&quot;I have a huge amount of regard for Andy and his leadership, what he brings to the game. What he brings to a team.&quot;He understands winning, he understands winning environments and he's very smart.&quot;He's definitely one of those guys you're looking at from a continuity perspective.&quot;I'm still not... I've spoken to all the four CEOs and directors of rugby as well in terms of the potential availability of coaches.&quot;Hopefully, in the next three or four weeks, we'll be able to put a list of those people together and agree terms with them and get that out there.&quot;Look, he's definitely one of the ones that has got... he's been on tour tours, he's been incredibly successful.&quot;A great role for him as a head coach and Ireland would have to make a decision if they're prepared to release him.&quot;I see massive benefits on someone going on a Lions tour in terms of what they learn about the players, the team they're playing against. It's a great experience, incredibly tough.&quot;That's up to the individual unions in terms of about whether they're prepared to release someone.&quot;So, we've had those conversations already about the availability of some people.&quot;Gatland has also spoken to Leinster&rsquo;s Stuart Lancaster about a potential role, but he is one of a number of candidates.He will be watching the internationals over the next few weeks, but says the 2021 Six Nations will be the place where he makes his final determination on the squad of either 35 or 36 players, with 20 forwards and 15 or 16 backs set to tour.&quot;A big yardstick for selection for the Lions is definitely the Six Nations. A couple of big match-ups domestically or in Europe as well have some significance,&rdquo; he said.&quot;The autumn is a chance to have some form, for us to take notice and for us to see how their form progresses in the Six Nations. It's different.&quot;

So with comparable FX, we would have recorded €270 million this quarter, which would correspond to an EBIT margin of 28%. I think I’d skip Slide 7, that is for your reference, the nine months, and we go straight into cash flow on Slide 8. Cash flow from operations improved significantly in the quarter. And as we can see before taxes and interest paid, it was €352 million versus €324 million the corresponding period of last year, so a 9% increase in raw cash flow from operation. If we then move down the table, we see that we have an adverse effect in working capital, and that is primarily receivables growing again.

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], October 29 (ANI): India's demand for gold for third quarter (July-September), 2020 has fallen by 30 per cent at 86.6 tonnes as compared to overall Q3 demand for 2019 at 123.9 tonnes, the World Gold Council (WGC) said here on Thursday.   According to the WGC report, gold demand value for the Q3 was at Rs 39,510 crores, down by 4 per cent as compared to Q3 2019 (Rs 41,300 crores).   "India's Q3 2020 gold demand fell by 30 per cent to 86.6 tonnes on the back of Covid related disruptions, bleak consumer sentiment and high prices accompanied by volatility. This is, however, higher than Q2 which at 64 tonnes was a 70 per cent drop and the second-lowest in our quarterly series. This has been partially due to the easing of lockdown and some low prices in August that provided a small window of buying opportunities for the discerning," said Somasundaram PR, Managing Director, India, WGC.   According to Somasundaram, Q3 tends to be relatively low generally due to seasonal factors like monsoons and inauspicious periods like Pitru-Paksh and Adhik Maas.  


  Jewellery demand for Q3 fell by 48 per cent to 52.8 tonnes as jewellery purchases did not have any support of festivals or weddings during this period.   "On the other hand, gold's safe-haven attributes and anticipation of price rise paved the way for an increase in investment demand for gold bars and coins by 51 per cent to 33.8 tonnes. One interesting development during these months of lockdown has been the rapid rise in digital engagement with several tech initiatives by top jewellers to woo buyers. Digital platforms selling allocated gold through wallets also recorded a sharp rise in volumes, along with significant activity in gold ETFs following a prolonged period of quiescence," Somasundaram has said.   Total jewellery demand in India for Q3 2020 decreased by 48 per cent at 52.8 tonnes as compared to Q3 2019 (101.6 tonnes). The value of jewellery demand was Rs 24,100 crores, down by 29 per cent from Q3 2019 (Rs 33,850 crores).   Total investment demand for Q3 2020 at 33.8 tonnes increased by 52 per cent in comparison to Q3 2019 (22.3 tonnes). In value terms, gold investment demand in Q3 2019 was Rs 15,410 crores, up by 107 per cent from Q3 2019 (Rs 7,450 crores).   The total gold recycled in India in Q3 2020 was 41.5 tonnes, up by 14 per cent compared to 36.5 tonnes in Q3 2019, according to WGC. (ANI)

Khan had not filed any campaign contribution forms with the Lodi City Clerk’s Office until last week, and the only transaction listed is a $25,000 loan he gave himself on July 18.
 He spent $12,590 of that on billboards, $4,014 on signs and stakes, and another $2,242 on social media, according to his campaign filings.
 Khan’s arrest comes just days before the election, and it is unknown what legal ramifications may be imposed if he happens to win next Tuesday.
 “Any candidate would remain on the ballot at this point, regardless of an arrest or conviction,“ San Joaquin County Registrar of Voters Melinda Dubroff said.
 Should a candidate’s eligibility for office change at any time after winning an election, or serving as an incumbent, the jurisdiction’s specific qualifications for that office would be the governing authority, she said.
 Lodi City Clerk Jennifer Cusmir said the city attorney was examining how to proceed should Khan win his election for the District 4 seat Tuesday.
 Khan is running against incumbent JoAnne Mounce and first-time candidates Natalie Bowman and Ramon Yepez.
