_Brasilia, 13 apr 09:53 - (Agenzia Nova)_ \- Un camice bianco ha vestito nella notte di domenica il Cristo redentore, l'imponente statua che sovrasta domina la montagna del Corcovado, a picco sulla città brasiliana di Rio de Janeiro. È l'omaggio che il paese ha voluto dedicare ai medici e operatori sanitari impegnati nella difficile lotta contro la diffusione del coronavirus, nel corso di una attesa cerimonia celebrata dall'arcivescovo don Orani Tempesta. Sotto il Cristo vestito da medico, con tanto di stetoscopio, è apparsa in rassegna la parola "grazie" in una quindicina di lingue. La statua ha anche "indossato" l'immagine di una infermiera con l'invito, ormai noto a tutte le latitudini, di rimanere in casa. Il Brasile, primo paese a registrare un caso di contagio in America latina, ha superato la soglia dei 22mila contagi, mentre il bilancio delle vittime tocca quota 1.223. (Brb)

We also need to examine this from a VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity) perspective and effectively safeguard our future. We should have an effective trade policy for minerals to enable us to be nimble footed and capture on spot market volatility (such as the rally in iron ore prices due to the Vale dam disaster in H1 2019 but we were not able to leverage the opportunity even though we had an inventory of 162 million tonnes at pit head) while at the same time ensure uninterrupted supplies for domestic industry. With the expected increase in demand for energy-critical, deep-seated and technology rare minerals such as Lithium and Cobalt, India needs to shift focus to explore and mine these minerals. A key intervention in the short term would be to acquire assets overseas like ONGC Videsh, which has acquired oil and gas assets outside India. In the long term, policy intervention is required to declare crucial minor minerals of national importance and drive a central policy to ensure uniformity across exploration and mining in different states.
