As COVID-19 rages on, security researchers say attackers are likely to continue to use the pandemic to sow chaos and exploit people's fears for profit in the coming year.
 The pandemic will remain a defining force in cybersecurity in the coming year, according to Kaspersky security researchers Ariel Jungheit, David Emm and Costin Raiu, who answered questions from Business Insider during a Thursday morning briefing on their 2021 cybersecurity predictions published this week.
 Hackers are capitalizing on the pandemic by exploiting people's uncertainties to get their attention and trick them into handing over credentials through phishing schemes, which are the most commonly-used hacking tactic, the team said.
 "Criminal groups and threat actors are using COVID-19 largely as a lure in order to hook their victims and get an initial foothold into a target organization," Emm said. "For attackers, it's the gift that keeps on giving because here are so many aspects of it that they can latch onto."

Guardiola's new contract will keep him at the club until 2023 and would mean Guardiola spending seven years at the Etihad Stadium – the same duration as his spells at Barcelona and Bayern Munich combined.
 The Catalan has long expressed his happiness in Manchester but insisted that he would only sign a new deal if he was convinced that he was still taking the club forward.
 “As a manager, I have everything that I need here,” he explained on Thursday. “Of course, all managers depend on results, obviously me as well and we have to win to continue.
 “I saw many times in the bad moments how the people here support me."
 Guardiola is the most successful coach in the club's history, having won two Premier League titles as well as four domestic cups, and seeing out his new deal would see him become City's longest-serving manager of the last 50 years.
 He clearly has the desire to build upon his legacy at City and wrestle back the title from Liverpool in what is now developing into a huge rivalry between two massive clubs.
 Despite making his worst-ever start to the season, with City 10th in the Premier League and winning fewer than half of their opening seven matches, he is happy with where his team is at, particularly because of the way in which his squad coped with a raft of injuries and positive coronavirus tests in the opening weeks of the season.
 "I am maybe happier than ever, 12 games, we lost one in all competitions," he said after the 1-1 draw with Liverpool before the international break.
 The fortnight break was the last substantial gap in the schedule until March, with City having at least two matches a week until the New Year, making it the perfect opportunity to consider his future.
 While he insisted the uncertainty over his next move had not disrupted the squad, the players can now have a clear picture of what the next two-and-a- half years will look like.
 Convincing Guardiola to stay was always the club's priority, even if they had drawn up a shortlist of potential replacements just to be safe.
 Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak insisted any talks over an extension would be a "comfortable conversation" and was unsurprisingly delighted at retaining the services of the man he believes to be the best coach in the world.
 “Pep’s contract extension is the natural next step in a journey which has evolved over many years," he said. "It is a product of the mutual trust and respect that exists between him and the entire club.
 "It also goes to the stability and creativity at the heart of our football operations.
 "Importantly, it is a validation of the football structure and philosophy that has been built over more than a decade and to which he has contributed so much."

Despite contention with a major fixture crush thanks to their Europa League commitments, Mourinho's team have defied their hectic schedule with a string of eye-catching performances.
 The influence of the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager, who has racked up near-two-dozen major honours during his two-decade-long career in the coaching hotseat, has been pronounced since he succeded Mauricio Pochettino last year.
 Tottenham have not tasted success since a League Cup triumph in 2008, though they have come close with a Champions League final in 2019 - but Kane believes that with the 57-year-old at the helm, the future is looking rosy.
 “We’ve got a long, long way to go,” the Three Lions skipper addressed the _Press Association_. “A long old season. I think, as proven in my career so far, it takes a lot to get over the line. We haven’t quite done that yet.
 “We’ve been close a few times so we know there’s going to be a lot of hard work from now until then to do that. It’s been a good start. Obviously, we lost the first game against Everton which was disappointing, but since then we've been unbeaten in the league.
 “Even the dropped points we had against West Ham and Newcastle with last- minute goals should have been wins from our point of view. We’re playing well.
 "I still think that we can improve and get better but obviously we’re second in the league. We’re in November, there’s still a lot of games to play, but we’re in a good spot.”
 On Mourinho's personal influence, which has helped Kane further blossom with a fine individual haul, the 27-year-old remained effusive, adding: “It’s been great to have him just at the training ground, on the training field.

GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) — The state Supreme Court has upheld the death penalty imposed on a man in the torture death of a mentally disabled woman in western Pennsylvania. A Westmoreland County jury had sentenced Melvin Knight to death by lethal injection in August 2013, but the commonwealth’s highest court ordered a new penalty trial in November 2016 after finding that jurors were not told that Knight had no criminal record. The justices said jurors should have been allowed to consider that as a mitigating factor. The second penalty phase trial was held in 2018, and Knight again received the death penalty. He then appealed that verdict, claiming it was improper and that errors by Common Pleas Court Judge Rita Hathaway warranted the penalty be overturned. In a unanimous ruling issued this week, the state Supreme Court rejected those claims, finding the verdict was fully supported by the evidence. Knight, 32, of Swissvale, was one of six people charged in the February 2010 death of 30-year-old Jennifer Daugherty in a dingy Greensburg apartment. Authorities have said she was beaten, tortured and stabbed to death before her body was tied with Christmas lights and garland, stuffed into a trash bin and discarded under a truck in a snow-covered parking lot. Knight and another man were both sentenced to death, while the other defendants are serving decades in prison.

New Competition - Rhodia gear up for grabs

Friday’s MAIS Class 3A championship between No. 1 Carroll Academy (12-0) and No. 2 Greenville Christian School (10-1) features highly-recruited skill players all over the field, but don’t be surprised if the title is decided down in the trenches.
 Perhaps the most important question is how much time Saints star quarterback DeAndre “D.J.” Smith will have to throw against a dangerous Rebels pass rush led by stud senior linemen Cooper Beck and Hunter Brower. In last week’s 15-6 semifinal victory over St. Joe, Carroll’s pressure proved effective against Fighting Irish quarterback Mekhi Norris.
 “I thought they did a good job containing Mekhi,” Greenville Christian coach Jon Reed McLendon said. “They didn’t let him get loose and do a ton of damage. I thought they were more physical than St. Joe, that was the big difference. That’s a place we know we have to match their intensity, match their physicality up front.”
 Smith might be more mobile than Norris, but the junior standout can’t escape everything. In Greenville Christian’s first playoff matchup, Indianola Academy’s pass rush kept the game tied at 6-6 until the fourth quarter, when Smith ran for one score and threw for another to help the Saints pull away.
 Last week’s semifinal was a different story as Smith enjoyed a clean pocket and Greenville Christian blew out Winona Christian, 50-7.
 “If D.J. has time, he’ll pick defenses apart,” McLendon said. “He’s just too good at this level. If we can get him time, he throws the ball where he wants to.”
 McLendon has handed the keys of his offense to Smith, a cerebral signal caller who has the ability to read the defense and keep the ball on any running play. Last week, the run-pass option worked to perfection on a 92-yard rushing touchdown early against Winona Christian.
 “It was an inside zone play and he saw a seam, pulled it out and took it the distance," McLendon said. "I thought he was going to pull a Daniel Jones. Probably the fastest I’ve ever seen him move. He had a couple steps where I thought he was going to lose it, but he caught his balance and ended up outrunning the defense.
 “It was pretty impressive, as good a passer as he is, he’s shown the ability to be plenty athletic and hurt people with his legs.”
 Beck, Brower and the rest of the Rebels’ front seven figure to be the toughest defensive challenge yet for the Saints’ offensive line. On the left side, Wendell Poindexter and Cordaryl Grant have been solid all season protecting Smith’s blind side. McLendon said he’s also relying on 6-foot-4, 320-pound Greenwood High transfer Terrion Ross to step up at right tackle.
 “We look for Big T, he’s our most physically imposing up front,” McLendon said. “He’s been really good for us run blocking over at right tackle. We need him to do a good job in pass protection Friday for us to have the success we’ve had.”
 If Greenville Christian’s offensive line can hold strong, it’s difficult to imagine Smith not doing damage with his weapons out wide. The Saints possess plenty of speed at receiver between Kerrick Ross, Davaris Pilcher and Daylin Metcalf, who totaled nine touchdowns in just five regular season games this year.
 Although they’ll likely spread the ball around and attack Carroll through the air, they can also pound the ball on the ground with their team captain, 210-pound running back Marlon Palmer.
 Greenville Christian may have better athletes on paper. But McLendon knows his Saints are facing a gritty Rebels squad that refuses to back down from anyone.
 “They’re physical — they get after it for four quarters,” the seventh-year head coach said. “Like I was telling (Carroll head coach Bo Milton), it’s not a game you look forward to because they’re going to try to beat you up. That’s the way they like to play.”
 “Carroll is undefeated, they’ve been pretty much consensus No. 1 in most rankings that you see all year,” McLendon added. “We still have some things left to prove. I think they’re going to be the best team we’ve seen and I’m excited for the challenge.”

Former Barcelona star Thiago made his way to England shortly after helping Bayern Munich to Champions League glory and a treble-winning triumph in 2019-20.
 He impressed through his early outings for the Reds, but has endured a frustrating time since then.
 The 29-year-old is among those to have contracted Covid-19, while an untimely injury picked up in an eventful Merseyside derby date with Everton in October has kept him sidelined for over a month.
 Jurgen Klopp is looking forward to welcoming another proven performer back into his plans, but Barnes says there is no guarantee that Thiago will walk into Liverpool’s starting XI.
 The Reds legend told _BonusCodeBets_: “When you are playing regularly that is when you can cement your position within the team, but, due to injuries, Thiago hasn’t been able to do that and played only a handful of games.
 “He will be in contention to play, depending on the game. If Liverpool are facing opposition who defend in numbers and defend deep, then Thiago is the man who can create something from nothing.
 “He is not necessarily one of the first names in the midfield three even before he was injured.
 “It is the same with Diogo Jota, both players are giving Liverpool options and have the same quality as the other players but are not certainties to start each week.

He had caught the eye at Pacos de Ferreira, tempting La Liga giants Atletico Madrid to make a move for his services.
 They were prepared to let Jota remain in his homeland after doing that deal, with a loan agreement put in place with Porto.
 At that stage, Jorge Simao made it clear to anyone prepared to listen that he saw a player of considerable promise following in the footsteps of a legendary countryman.
 Simao, who worked with Jota at Pacos de Ferriera, told _The Athletic_: “Nobody does what Jota is doing now without having real ambition.
 “When he signed for Porto [in 2016], I told a Portuguese website that, for me, Jota would be the successor to Cristiano Ronaldo.
 “Obviously, that was quite a big claim to make at that time, because Jota had only played for Pacos and had not had a good time at Atletico Madrid.
 “When Jota signed for Liverpool, I sent him a message to congratulate him. He replied, five seconds later, with a link to that old article about him and Ronaldo.
 “It was the very first thing he sent! He must have had it bookmarked. Incredible! He hadn’t forgotten.”
 Liverpool snapped Jota up from Wolves in the summer transfer window.
 He had recorded 44 goals through 131 appearances at Molineux and quickly set about making his mark on Merseyside.

TORONTO - Online shoppers may have recently noticed new options on the checkout pages of their favourite retailers: buy now, pay later.
 In addition to standard payment methods like credit cards and PayPal, companies such as Sephora makeup, Herschel Supply Co. backpacks and Lush beauty products offer new options from fintechs like PayBright, Afterpay, Sezzle, Klarna, QuadPay and Affirm.
 These new services focus on nominal purchases and allow consumers to pay in instalments, sometimes interest-free -- which can be enticing for Canadians who are low on cash during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 However the options are not without their pitfalls.
 After a qualifying process, the services allow shoppers to pay for their purchases in small increments spread out over weeks or months and sometimes offer access to a tracking portal where they can adjust their payments if unforeseen circumstances come up.
 Some, like Afterpay, make most of their revenue from retailers and don't charge fees or interest to shoppers, but experts advise against them because they often encourage consumers to spend beyond their means.
 "The thing that can really get you in trouble is thinking of it as 'oh $20 here, $60 there is not a big deal,' but those little purchases can add up really quick," said Julia Faletski, a Vancouver-based financial adviser at CI Direct Investing.
 "You just don't want to get yourself in this situation where that leather jacket is the thing that sinks your finances."
 However, despite the danger of getting too deep in debt, the services do have their upsides, she said.
 For example, if you agree to zero per cent interest rates or rates that are lower than your credit card and can pay something off speedily, then the services can work for you.
 Laura Nadler, the chief financial officer of AfterPay U.S., said her company’s service is ideal for consumers who want to stagger payments to line up with a budget or match when a bi-weekly paycheck comes in.
 AfterPay’s offering, she said, is also good for people who don’t want to take out a traditional loan or pay upfront fees or interest.
 When deciding whether to use a pay now, buy later service for a nominal purchase, think about it in steps, said Chantel Chapman, the Vancouver-based founder of the W-T-Finances blog and a former financial literacy consultant.

Editor, Commonwealth:
 Over 50 million abortions have been performed in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade legalized the procedure in 1973, and not one had a name. It is a shame on this country and a fraud on females. I wonder if those precious souls went to heaven. I wonder if the young women, in the still of the night, ever regretted their very sad decisions. But I don’t blame them, for they were young and scared and in a difficult situation. They were vulnerable, and the system took advantage of them.
 These trusting young women, by the tens of thousands, were told by their older superiors that an abortion is the easy remedy to their problem. A brief inconvenience! Then, they said, these women can continue their lives as if nothing ever happened because no one will ever know. But the women will always know.
 In the hours after the procedure, I cannot imagine any scenario of celebration. No party to praise the political victory of Roe v. Wade. No one ever mentioned the emotional disaster that may by waiting on the woman. She alone will very well bear the heavy burden of regret for all her days, knowing that 9-pound intruder instead might have become her best friend one day and shared secrets and laughter or even become her eyes and ears.
 The key issue is not whether abortion is legal or not, but rather is the state pro-child or not?
 After millions of abortions, it is obvious that Uncle Sam is anti-child. So we must ask why. It so happened, and I don’t think it a coincidence, that a famous book was published in 1968 that could give us an answer.
 Yes, five years before Roe v. Wade, the enormously successful “The Population Bomb” hit the bookstores. With its grave warnings, this book captivated this country and half the world with its predictions of doom as a consequence of world overpopulation.
 In 1968, our war in Vietnam was at its height. There was rioting in the streets, and Bobby Kennedy was slain. I would have thought that the Washington elite would have had more pressing issues to ponder than how to eliminate millions of U.S. children, but I would have been wrong. Apparently after reading this very influential book, their goal became population reduction. This duplicitous decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, under the guise of helping women, did just the opposite, but it achieved its real goal 50 million times. Then, to add insult to injury, the revenue lost from the millions who never worked is recuperated by allowing millions of “illegals” to work here instead.
 Through human history, there have always been families, but legal marriage, as we know it, is a relatively recent development. But there is one thing that hasn’t changed over time. There is no stronger human bond than the one between a mother and her child. Hence, there is no celebration for the childless anywhere on Earth.
 Children belong to the future or in the reflection; they bring out the child in us all. They are miracles because they make us better people. They give us the gift of happiness. They are trust personified in tiny bodies.
 O bless the little children, for they take us to where love is. They make us feel important. Parents are blessed beyond measure because their children love them and make them immortal. Truly, little lives matter.

Esquire gives Philly's Kalaya top spot on 'Best New Restaurants' list


--DocBreak--
NEW YORK (AP) — Now that his largely invisible network has suddenly been flooded by fans of President Donald Trump, Newsmax television personality Grant Stinchfield is puffing out his chest.
 "They don't know what to do with all of us," Stinchfield said on the air Monday night. "We're killing it here on Newsmax with a tactic they've never tried. It's called the truth, the stone-cold truth, and once you get a taste of it, you will never tolerate being lied to again."
 The conservative network's critics suggest the opposite is true, that Newsmax's viewers are being presented discredited stories such as a voting system that changed or deleted votes, questions about how closely Republicans were able to monitor vote-counting and the volume of absentee ballots being accepted.
 There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.
 Newsmax's burst, whether or not it lasts, has been astonishingly swift and could foreshadow significant competition to Fox News Channel's dominance with conservative viewers in two decades.
 "We've really cornered Fox from the right," said Chris Ruddy, Newsmax founder and friend of Trump. "They've never had that."
 From the beginning of July to the week before Election Day, Newsmax averaged 58,000 viewers from 7 to 10 p.m. on weekdays. That jumped to 568,000 the week after the election, the Nielsen company said. In the same period, daytime viewership increased from 46,000 to 450,000.
 For the same dates, Fox News averaged 3.6 million viewers in the evening, Nielsen said. Fox's prime-time viewership during the two weeks after the election was up 50 percent over last year.
 "We love competition. We have always thrived on competition," Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch said on an Election Day earnings call.
 Ruddy traced much of Newsmax's increase to Trump supporters angered by Fox's election night call that Democrat Joe Biden had won Arizona — ahead of any other news organization. While that call proved correct, for the president's backers it was an ill-timed sign of insufficient loyalty from their favorite network.
 Trump, who criticized Fox throughout the campaign, has driven the point home with repeated tweets suggesting his followers check out Newsmax or a smaller rival that also presses a conservative viewpoint, One America News Network.
 "There's a large part of the country that wants to have a voice, the same people who gave birth to what turned into a very robust Fox News," said Michael Clemente, Newsmax's CEO until last April and a former Fox News executive. "Now, more than ever, they want to be heard, and have influence equal to their peers on the coasts. Their loyalty is to that voice and not to any place or another."
 Newsmax says it has an editorial staff of 70, including those attached to its website, which at midday Wednesday led with stories about Trump's press secretary calling restrictions on Thanksgiving gatherings "Orwellian," and the president's latest false tweet claiming an election victory.
 The television network is running a clever ad telling conservative viewers not to be "out-foxed," but it was telling on Monday that both Newsmax and OANN spent considerable time discussing an interview that was conducted on Fox, where a Trump lawyer predicted her client would win by millions of votes.
 Programming generally consists of news talk shows, and it's not difficult to see where the loyalty lies.
 "Donald Trump is the most powerful person in the world," said Greg Kelly, a former personality at Fox's New York affiliate who is Newsmax's most polished broadcaster. "Not because he's president, but because he's loved by so many people."
 When Newsmax's Chris Salcedo asked a question about Biden during an interview Monday with Trump aide Peter Navarro, he was quickly brushed off.
 "As far as I'm concerned, President Trump is going to have a second term," Navarro said.
 Newsmax hasn't declared Biden the president-elect, unlike other news organizations, including Fox and The Associated Press. They say they are waiting for final certification of the vote before doing so.
 Even though Ruddy conceded in an interview that Trump has an extremely narrow chance of overturning the results, he said it's up to the states, not media organizations, to declare a winner. When that process is done, Newsmax will accept the winner, he said.
 But if Trump's chances of overturning the results are so small, why should a discussion about them dominate Newsmax's airtime?
 "I think that people that are not pro-Trump or don't like him think we should get past it or they are tired of it," he said. "But conservatives are quite anxious to hear about developments."
 He said he differs from Trump in believing the administration should be cooperating in a transition, even if the president holds out hope that the results could somehow be overturned.
 "I would tell him if I speak to him that I think they should engage in a transition," he said.
 The spotlight on smaller rivals comes at an extraordinarily tumultuous time at Fox. There's always been a tension between the news and opinion sides of the network, but this time it's reflected in the ultimate "unspinnable" story of election results, said Nicole Hemmer, a Columbia University professor and author of "Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics."
 In some respects, the surge in Newsmax's viewership represents a temper tantrum by some Fox viewers, she said.
 For Newsmax, a big question is whether its programming is compelling enough to hold viewers who are clearly sampling. Besides Kelly, former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer is Newsmax's best-known personality. Both their shows are aired twice a night; Ruddy said a new prime-time show will start next month and another is in the works.
 "It's going to be a challenge for (Newsmax) to grow their numbers in the way that Fox did because of the lack of a news operation," Hemmer said.

"I built it from [the] ground up," Whitney told Business Insider. "I did it without help, without funding."
 The Houston native, who says she's all about "celebrating women's bodies," said she wanted to make a skirt that would tuck in stomachs and accentuate curves. The patent skirt was born and it quickly took off. Celebrities like Cardi B and Keke Palmer donned the piece, and orders skyrocketed, Whitney said. Trendy retailers Urban Outfitters and Dolls Kill started selling her skirts online.
 "That piece is the piece that really catapulted my brand," said Whitney. The corset skirt took her "from the outside looking in to an overnight sensation," she said.
 Over the past three years, Grayscale has continued to be a favorite among heavy hitters of the music world. Doja Cat wore one of Whitney's designs, a two-piece cow skin patterned number, in her viral music video "Mooo!" Ariana Grande wore a pink organza Grayscale jacket in her "Thank you, next" music video, and Megan Thee Stallion has worn the brand too.

 ## Experts question the program's distribution plan
 Although many public-health experts have lauded Operation Warp Speed, some are still concerned about how vaccine distribution will go -- especially since states were required to come up with their own distribution plans. A decentralized approach could cause supply-chain issues and slow the process of administering shots, particularly in remote areas.
 "I'm a bit concerned about their current plan because it's not clear to me how much guidance was given to the states to assure a uniformity of distribution," Marissa Levine, a public-health professor at the University of South Florida, told Business Insider.
 It might have been easier, she added, to lean on distribution plans used during previous public-health crises, like the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. During that crisis, the CDC played a lead role in vaccine distribution.

Taking all of these in light of the pandemic we are battling, perhaps a fourth question is now in order (with my apologies to the author): "Quo(vid) vadis, Philippines?".

On the basis of indication, the cancer vaccines market is classified into cervical cancer, prostate cancer, and others. The cervical cancer segment accounted for maximum market revenue in 2019, and is anticipated to maintain its dominant position during the forecast period, owing to increase in number of people suffering from human papilloma virus (HPV) infections. In addition, high prevalence of cervical cancer drives the market growth. However, prostate cancer is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 14.10% from 2020 to 2027, owing to the rise in demand for Provenge (prostate cancer vaccine) along with increase in number of prostate cancer vaccines in the pipeline.

In 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to nauseating heights. Then it came crashing down.
 After closing at $876 on January 2, 2017, it began its journey to it's all- time-high price of $19,783 in December that year, before falling back towards $3,000 over the next 12 months.
 Now, the price of the cryptocurrency is jumping again. It currently sits at over $18,000.
 This is because of factors like an increase in institutional investors in the space, heightened demand, and a broadening normalization of the asset -- PayPal, for example, recently announced that it will allow cryptocurrency transactions on its platform.
 Some fear the hype is overblown, however, and that a repeat of bitcoin's Icarus-like fall is bound to occur.
 But according to Greg King, CEO of Osprey Funds, while the cryptocurrency may see its price drop in the short-term, it still has a lot of room to run in the longer-term. King has been creating cryptocurrency investment products -- like the Osprey Bitcoin Trust -- since 2016.
 "I do think that you could see a pullback because it's been a big run, but in the grand scheme of things, I still think there's a long way to go in terms of the potential upside for bitcoin," King told Business Insider on Wednesday.
 Bitcoin bulls have been making eye-catching predictions for its price trajectory. Billionaire Mike Novogratz said on CNBC on Wednesday that by the end of next year it could hit $60,000. Venture capitalist Tim Draper has said bitcoin will rise to $250,000 by sometime in 2023, a prediction that King said is "possible."

Despite having only just turned 17 in May, Marcos Leonardo is already making his mark on the first team, after finding the net on over 100 occasions since joining the club as an 11-year-old.
 Though not yet a starter for the Brazilian giants, it is seen as only a matter of time before he earns that opportunity as the latest 'Menino da Vila' – a term used to describe youngsters who have grown up within the academy structure – to emerge at Estadio Urbano Caldeira.
 Born in Itapetinga in the north east of Brazil, Leonardo took his first footballing steps under the watchful eye of his father at the 'Athlete for Christ' programme, which helped underprivileged children through the power of the national game.
 His talent was immediately clear and it was soon decided that Leonardo's family would move 950 miles south and relocate to Sao Paulo in a bid to catch the eye of one of Brazil's biggest clubs.
 By the time 2014 rolled around, Leonardo had been picked up by Santos, and set about impressing their coaches right away.
 "I noticed a very strong nose for the goal, that he was opportunistic and always well-positioned," Gustavo Roma, the club's Under-13s coach, told the Santos website of Leonardo, who even then was playing two years above his own age.
 "He is a very good finisher, he always tries to be present in every game, is very mobile and intense, with a very good intuition. He is not static waiting for the ball to arrive, he moves to find the best position to be able to finish. That's why he scores so many goals."
 As the lead central striker within the club's youth system, his goalscoring record is unrivalled, with many hopeful he can go onto surpass the achievements of Gabigol and succeed in the European game as well as in South America.
 The early signs are good, after he was called-up to train with the first-team squad back in July.

If that title doesn't ring a bell, maybe the name Rod Serling will. The first thing that probably comes to mind is _The Twilight Zone_, but that hit series wasn't the Syracuse native's only foray into the world of televised anthologies with a genre twist. Between 1969 and 1973, NBC ran three seasons of _Night Gallery_ , another show defined by a collection of disconnected stories set within the realms of fantasy, horror, and sci-fi. Also hosted by Serling — and his instantly recognizable voice — this program used an eerie and dimly-lit art gallery as its general framing device. Each episode was broken up into two to three segments, and each tale of the otherworldly was preceded by an original (and oftentimes creepy) painting.
