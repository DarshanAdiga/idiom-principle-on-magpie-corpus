Justin Longmuir admits he's "not happy" with Fremantle's crippling injury list but says the responsibility of ensuring a healthy squad falls on everyone within the club's football department.
 The Dockers have about one-third of their best team out of action and have lost more games to injury than any other club in Longmuir's first year as coach, except for North Melbourne.
 Their key position stocks have been hit particularly hard, with Alex Pearce, Joel Hamling, Griffin Logue and Jesse Hogan all missing extended periods of the truncated 2020 campaign.
 The boost felt through captain Nat Fyfe's return from a hamstring strain for Sunday's meeting with Collingwood has been offset by electric star Michael Walters going out of the side with a similar issue.
 Fremantle have also confirmed this week Darcy Tucker will miss the rest of the season with a significant hamstring tear.
 "We're not happy with the situation," Longmuir said.
 "We're constantly reviewing everything we do as a football department, so we need to get it right.
 "It's on everyone. It's on the way we prepare the and it's on the way they (players) prepare themselves.
 "Some of it's unlucky. We review every injury on its merits and come to a finding on all injuries.
 "We'll continue to do that and continue to work on all our practices at the footy club, individuals included."
 Fremantle have used 32 players this season - only Sydney, the Bulldogs (both 35) and Adelaide (33) have used more - and have handed senior debuts to five young players.
 "Clearly as a coach you'd like your best players out there and a full list to choose from, I'm not going to shy away from that," Longmuir said.
 "It's frustrating, but for where we're at, it creates a lot of opportunity for players and I think this period of time is going to hold us in good stead for the future.
 "We get to see what our depth is like and we get to expose Tobe Watson, Michael Frederick and those types of players earlier than we would if we had a full list."
 Walters could be back for the Dockers' round 11 match against Hawthorn, after a bye in round 10.
 Veteran midfielder Stephen Hill (adductor), key forward Jesse Hogan (calf), young gun Sam Sturt (ankle) and Stefan Giro (ankle) could also be available after the bye.

There will be no walk up to the royal box. No Prince William to hand over the trophy.
 Either Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Chelsea counterpart Cesar Azpilicueta will have to pick it up themselves on the pitch.
 Even the traditional pre-match "Abide With Me" hymn will be a prerecorded version by Emeli Sande at Wembley Stadium.
 Played without any crowd due to pandemic restrictions, the 139th FA Cup final on Saturday will be the most unusual in the history of the world's oldest football competition.
 And it will be played more than two months after it was originally scheduled, on an August day when England would usually be preparing for the start of a new domestic season rather than completing the last one.
 "It's definitely been a crazy season for everyone," Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic said.
 The American will be one of only up to 300 people allowed in a stadium that fits 90,000.
 Fans will still be heard ahead of kickoff for a minute when conversations about mental health involving fans and players are played out as part of a soundscape.
 Before kickoff -- like every English game in the last six weeks -- players will take a knee to show solidarity with campaigns against racial injustice.
 It's why this is being called the Heads Up FA Cup final -- with Emirates airline handing over the title sponsorship to the mental wellbeing campaign spearheaded by Prince William.
 "I believe more than ever that football can be the catalyst that drives this change and brings us closer together," said the second-in-line to the British throne.
 And in a rare moment of footballing candor this week, the Aston Villa- supporting Duke of Cambridge said he would previously have been a "bit concerned" about his son, Prince George, supporting Chelsea.
 "But now," he said. "Frank's come in I feel the culture's a bit different at Chelsea and I'd be OK with it."
 Chelsea's all-time top-scorer, Lampard has exceeded expectations in his first season back at the west London club as manager.
 The former midfielder was unable to make any signings when he took charge a year ago due to a FIFA transfer ban, with Pulisic the only addition to the squad before the deal was already in place.
 But Lampard led Chelsea to a fourth-place finish to ensure Champions League qualification and now has an early chance to pick up a cup.
 "At this stage in my career, my first year at Chelsea then of course I'd love to do that," Lampard said. "Many a great manager over periods of time have not been able to win things."
 Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has certainly been impressed by the 42-year-old Lampard's introduction to the Premier League.
 "The consistency he was able to play for that many years, in the position that he played at such a big club, and doing what he did, was incredible," Arteta said. "Big credit to him on that. As a manager he has shown, since he went to Derby (before Chelsea), the kind of person and ambition that he has, and the way he encourages his team to play.
 "Again this season he has done a really good job. We are both young, we are both trying to learn as well our positions."
 Arteta left Manchester City, where he was Pep Guardiola's assistant, in December to replace Unai Emery after the north London club struggled in the post-Arsene Wenger era.
 Arteta was Arsenal captain for two of Wenger's seven FA Cup wins.
 "I have been in touch in the last few months a few times with him but not before the final," the 38-year-old Arteta said. "It is private conversations but it is great to have him on board. He gives you great advice ... He has got such a knowledge and he is such an intelligent person, that just knowing he is there and he is going to be supporting us and supporting me, I feel calmer."
 While Chelsea has already secured European qualification, winning the FA Cup is the only route into the Europa League for Arsenal after finishing eighth in the Premier League -- 10 points behind Chelsea.
 "We've worked so hard since I joined here to try to bring this club back to winning titles, so if we can achieve that I will be delighted," Arteta said. "But not for myself. For the players and the club.
 "They've been through some very difficult moments in the last few seasons and as well for our fans, because they really deserve ... some joy and some nice moments."

Born in Nashville, one of the four playing stops her dad made during his NHL career, Kylie and her family have been living in Rhode Island since she entered second grade. It was Mark who introduced Kylie to golf.
 “He’s always played golf,” said Kylie Eaton. “He got me into the game and I just love it.”
 When it came to match play, Kylie was a neophyte prior to last year’s breakthrough win at Kirkbrae.
 “Being able to win that gave me so much confidence. Now I love match play,” said Eaton. “Honestly, what keeps me in check is that match play is you versus the course. This week, it was me versus a girl named Montaup. I have no control over what Gianna does, but I do have control on how I handle the course. It’s pretty much how I go about it.”
 Mark Eaton has a ring from Pittsburgh’s Stanley Cup winner in 2009. Now 43, he also suited up as a defenseman who shot lefthanded for Philadelphia and the New York Islanders. Presently, Eaton is the Director of Player Development for the Chicago Blackhawks.
 To have a dad who has competed at the highest level is a major asset, particularly when addressing the mental side and the need to have short-term memory when things don’t go your way.
 “I’ve learned a lot from the way he looks at [golf] and know there are some moves that I can risk now,” said Kylie Eaton. “You might have a bad hole, but my dad definitely helped me to calm down a lot. He told me to take a few deep breaths.”
 The 2020 Kirkbrae Women’s Championship is still ahead, as are a number of competitive tennis tournaments. For Eaton, it’s full speed ahead as the next sporting endeavor awaits.

After a brief debate with her caddie Mark, also her father, a 13-year NHL veteran, Eaton decided to concede the hole and subsequently the semifinal match to Papa, who emerged with a hard-fought 2-and-1 victory that earned her a Friday finals matchup against Alexis Florio.
 The defending women’s club champion at Kirkbrae Country Club, Eaton’s time at Montaup may have ended on
 a somber note, yet there’s no question that she gained a lot of experience that figures to serve her well moving forward. She was two up on Papa after eight holes. Before Eaton knew it, she needed to rally after Papa won holes 9-12 to surge ahead by two.
 With his daughter needing to make a move and fast, Mark Eaton reminded Kylie that starting with hole No. 13, three of the next four holes were par fives, her specialty. A birdie on 13 cut Papa’s lead to one, but Eaton found herself once again down by two after bogeying the par-three 14th. The par-five 15th yielded a more favorable outcome with Eaton netting another birdie to trail by one with three holes remaining.
 Both parred No. 16 – another par-five – before the scene shifted to the match’s final hole.
 “I battled. I didn’t play my best (Thursday), but I was able to hang in there,” said Eaton, who lives in Smithfield and is heading into her sophomore year at Moses Brown. “All of my matches this week went to at least the 17th hole. I got more comfortable as each match went on. Anything that I do, it’s going to help me handle the pressure and be excited rather than nervous.
 “Honestly, I’m going to go work on my wedge game,” she added. “I can’t be missing greens completely with a wedge in my hands.”

MONMOUTH -- Following an outbreak of COVID-19 among staff at Monmouth- Roseville District 238, including the district's superintendent, the board of education is reversing course on its earlier decision for in-person instruction for the upcoming school year.
   
 At a remote meeting Thursday, the board voted unanimously to switch to remote learning for the entire fall semester.
   
 This reverses the unanimous vote by the board at an in-person meeting on July 16 to have in-school instruction five days a week.
   
 Superintendent Ed Fletcher said the board reconsidered the district's plan after he and other staff members tested positive for COVID-19.
   
 "On a personal note, it made all of us realize how difficult any outbreak, regardless of how small, would be to manage during the school year," Fletcher said.
   
 In addition to staff members testing positive, Fletcher said substitute teachers were bowing out of working in the fall due to concerns about the outbreak.
   
 "When you start to add all of these things up, we realized that we would not be able to put forth an environment where we can ensure safety of our students and staff," Fletcher said.
   
 Fletcher said several members of his family have also tested positive for the virus, and all are recovering.
   
 "From my perspective, the virus is real," he said, noting that it has hit him the hardest. "I'm still having some lingering effects. Every day gets a little better."
   
 Fletcher said the board reconvened to look at different variables following the outbreak before coming to a decision.
   
 "They understand the hardship this causes our parents. We hope parents understand the reasons," Fletcher said, "At the end of the day, the biggest responsibility we have is to keep our students and staff safe."
   
 All board members in attendance at the remote meeting Thursday voted to switch to remote learning, including Kevin Killey, Anita Sells, Cathy Froelich, Joe Bratcher, Nicole Trego and Dan Watson. Board member P.J. Brooks was absent for the special meeting.

The Tu-154 plane crashed on April 10, 2010 while landing at the airport of Smolensk, Russia. There were 96 people on board: 88 passengers and eight crew members. They were flying to Russia to take part in memorial events in Katyn, where in 1940 thousands of Polish prisoners of war were killed. The crash left no survivors.
 In 2011, the Interstate Aviation Committee published the final report of the results of the technical investigation, according to which the primary cause of the crash was the decision of the crew not to leave for an alternate airfield. Deficiencies in flight support and crew training were named as secondary reasons that led to the tragedy that killed almost the entire Polish administration.
 The first Polish commission, led by former Interior Minister Jerzy Miller, came to similar conclusions. According to the conclusions of Miller's commission, the airliner crashed because it descended below the allowed minimum despite thick fog. The report also pointed out the "mistakes" of Russian dispatchers at the Smolensk airport. However, the Polish authorities did not agree either with the IAC report or the conclusions of the Miller Commission and decided to set up a second commission to continue the investigation.

The disaster movies of the 1990’s, partially fueled by “We can do this now!” advancements in special effects, were selling the fantastical and/or unlikely nature of their doomsday scenarios. No one watched _Independence Day_ or even _Titanic_ expecting to encounter a comparable disaster anytime soon, and even _Twister_ kept its tornado-specific body count in the single digits. It was the end of the world we knew it, but moviegoers were encouraged to feel fine.

Wapello County is among eight counties in Iowa that the White House considers to be “red zones” for COVID-19. Wapello joined the list this week in the White House’s report, which was published by the New York Times.
 The report was dated July 26, and was published by the Times on Tuesday. To be a red zone, a county must have more than 100 new cases per 100,000 in population and a positivity rate above 10% over the one-week period of July 18-24.
 The White House recommends that counties in the red zone close bars and gyms, strict social distancing be put into place for restaurants and for face masks to be required by all businesses. None of those practices are currently implemented.
 The Appanoose County Department of Public Health confirmed all three new cases, adding the new cases are an 18-40-year-old male, an 18-40-year-old female and a 61-80-year-old female.

GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona voters go to the polls Tuesday to cast ballots in primary races for nine seats in the U.S. House, but much of the attention will be on the Democratic primary in 6th Congressional District. Democrats see the 6th District, a Republican stronghold which covers much of north Phoenix, Paradise Valley, Fountain Hills and Scottsdale, as winnable because of a long-running ethics investigation into five-term GOP incumbent Rep. David Schweikert. The House Ethics Committee investigation was wrapped up Thursday, with Schweikert admitting to 11 violations and agreeing to pay a $50,000 fine. The panel concluded he used congressional staff in his campaigns, pressured them to do political work and received gifts or a loan from an employee, and that he committed a series of campaign finance violations. Schweikert had denied wrongdoing, but took responsibility for the problems in a letter to the committee that also said he agreed to settle the case in part because it was “was time consuming and extremely costly.” He's unopposed in the Republican primary, but used tens of thousands in campaign funds to hire lawyers, leaving him underfunded for a real challenge. That challenge is coming from four Democrats, one of whom will emerge Tuesday to take on Schweikert in November. They include Dr. Hiral Tipirneni, a physician who lost special and general election efforts in 2018 to win the GOP-heavy 8th District but earned strong name identification and has far outraised the other three Democrats on the ballot. She’s running television campaign ads that don’t mention the other Democrats. Another top contender is tech entrepreneur Anita Malik, who challenged Schweikert in 2018.

London, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 31st Jul, 2020 ) :World stock markets ended the week on a low note Friday in the face of almost unremitting bad news of rapidly-shrinking economic activity, highlighting the "devastating impact" coronavirus has had on the global economy, analysts said.
 A tweet from US President Donald Trump suggesting delaying November's elections also jolted investors, helping send the euro soaring to a two-year peak.
 But it was the huge drops in April-June economic activity -- a contraction of one third in the United States while Europe faces its worst recession in a quarter of a century \-- which were proving hardest to swallow as main indices all lost further ground to cap a miserable week.
 And more of the same is likely to follow.
 "A tough August seems to beckon for stock markets, with a flat performance perhaps the best that investors can hope for," forecast Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG.
 With virus cases on the up in many places, he added that "Europe going back into lockdown would be bad enough, but the US doesn't seem to be anywhere near ending its first set of restrictions." Markets are struggling to digest massive double-digit falls in economic output as well as a swathe of mostly grim corporate earnings -- tech giants aside -- which only further highlighted the damage done by the virus.
 France's economy contracted by a record 13.8 percent in the second quarter, Spain slumped 18.5 percent, Portugal contracted 14.1 percent and Italy shrank 12.4 percent.
 Europe as a whole was hammered by its sharpest recorded contraction in the second quarter, with GDP down 12.1 percent in the eurozone and 11.9 percent across the full EU.
 Gains in the techs helped provide some support but not enough to make a huge difference at the end of yet another turbulent week.
 The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index led the US market, adding 1.0 percent mid-session after tech giants Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Facebook all reported better-than-expected results as the sector looks to be the big winner amid the pandemic upheaval.
 Analysts had questioned whether tech shares could go higher still after the results came in, but Amazon, Apple and Facebook all won big gains early Friday, while Google-parent Alphabet fell.

Church & Dwight posted adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and improved 35.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level.      Net sales of $1,194.3 million advanced 10.6% year over year. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,150.8 million. Results were backed by solid demand for various products stemming from the coronavirus outbreak.      Organic sales rose 8.4% on the back of increased consumption, reduced couponing and retail inventory restocking. The uptick was fueled by a positive product mix and pricing, and a rise in volumes of 3.5% and 4.9%, respectively.      Gross margin expanded 220 basis points (bps) to 46.8% on improved pricing, lower promotional costs and couponing. Also, enhanced productivity was a reason. These were somewhat offset by increased manufacturing expenses, costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak and currency headwinds.      Also, marketing expenses fell 5.3% to $122.3 million. As a percentage of sales, it contracted 180 bps to 10.2%.SG&A expenses increased 13.1% to $186.6 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses increased 30 bps to 15.6%.

There will be no walk up to the royal box. No Prince William to hand over the trophy.Either Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Chelsea counterpart Cesar Azpilicueta will have to pick it up themselves on the pitch.Even the traditional pre-match "Abide With Me" hymn will be a prerecorded version by Emeli Sande at Wembley Stadium.Played without any crowd due to pandemic restrictions, the 139th FA Cup final on Saturday will be the most unusual in the history of the world's oldest football competition.And it will be played more than two months after it was originally scheduled, on an August day when England would usually be preparing for the start of a new domestic season rather than completing the last one."It's definitely been a crazy season for everyone," Chelsea winger Christian Pulisic said.The American will be one of only up to 300 people allowed in a stadium that fits 90,000.Fans will still be heard ahead of kickoff for a minute when conversations about mental health involving fans and players are played out as part of a soundscape.Before kickoff -- like every English game in the last six weeks -- players will take a knee to show solidarity with campaigns against racial injustice.It's why this is being called the Heads Up FA Cup final -- with Emirates airline handing over the title sponsorship to the mental wellbeing campaign spearheaded by Prince William."I believe more than ever that football can be the catalyst that drives this change and brings us closer together," said the second-in-line to the British throne.And in a rare moment of footballing candor this week, the Aston Villa-supporting Duke of Cambridge said he would previously have been a "bit concerned" about his son, Prince George, supporting Chelsea."But now," he said. "Frank's come in I feel the culture's a bit different at Chelsea and I'd be OK with it."Chelsea's all-time top-scorer, Lampard has exceeded expectations in his first season back at the west London club as manager.The former midfielder was unable to make any signings when he took charge a year ago due to a FIFA transfer ban, with Pulisic the only addition to the squad before the deal was already in place.But Lampard led Chelsea to a fourth-place finish to ensure Champions League qualification and now has an early chance to pick up a cup."At this stage in my career, my first year at Chelsea then of course I'd love to do that," Lampard said. "Many a great manager over periods of time have not been able to win things."Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has certainly been impressed by the 42-year-old Lampard's introduction to the Premier League."The consistency he was able to play for that many years, in the position that he played at such a big club, and doing what he did, was incredible," Arteta said. "Big credit to him on that. As a manager he has shown, since he went to Derby (before Chelsea), the kind of person and ambition that he has, and the way he encourages his team to play."Again this season he has done a really good job. We are both young, we are both trying to learn as well our positions."Arteta left Manchester City, where he was Pep Guardiola's assistant, in December to replace Unai Emery after the north London club struggled in the post-Arsene Wenger era.Arteta was Arsenal captain for two of Wenger's seven FA Cup wins."I have been in touch in the last few months a few times with him but not before the final," the 38-year-old Arteta said. "It is private conversations but it is great to have him on board. He gives you great advice ... He has got such a knowledge and he is such an intelligent person, that just knowing he is there and he is going to be supporting us and supporting me, I feel calmer."While Chelsea has already secured European qualification, winning the FA Cup is the only route into the Europa League for Arsenal after finishing eighth in the Premier League -- 10 points behind Chelsea."We've worked so hard since I joined here to try to bring this club back to winning titles, so if we can achieve that I will be delighted," Arteta said. "But not for myself. For the players and the club."They've been through some very difficult moments in the last few seasons and as well for our fans, because they really deserve ... some joy and some nice moments."

PORTSMOUTH – Kylie Eaton now has a story to tell when it comes to bad breaks on the golf course.
 The 15-year-old spent her Thursday morning mounting a serious charge against this year’s top seed in the Rhode Island Golf Association’s Women’s Amateur Championship. Standing in the 17th fairway, Eaton pulled a wedge. The ball didn’t land on a postage stamp of a green at Montaup Country Club, rather it nestled under a nearby group of shrubs.
 With Gianna Papa already on the green and eyeing a round-closing par, Eaton faced a dilemma. She could have attempted to hit the ball where it was positioned and risk sailing it across the putting surface. The other option would have required her to take a drop, meaning she would have been hitting four off the green while Papa was sitting pretty.

Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani on Friday called for urgent policy measures to make 2G ‘a part of history’, while rival Sunil Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Airtel, made a renewed pitch for lowering of levies on the sector.
 Noting that about 300 million mobile subscribers in India are still “trapped” in the 2G era, he said, “Their feature phones keep them excluded even from the basic uses of Internet at a time when both India and the rest of the world are standing at the doorstep of 5G telephony. Necessary policy steps should be taken... to make 2G a part of history.”
 The statement by Mr. Ambani, at an event to commemorate the ‘25th anniversary of mobile telephony in India’, comes about 15 days after the announcement that RIL’s Jio Platforms, had developed 5G technology that would be deployed in India next year.
 “As we take legitimate pride in the achievements of mobility in the last 25 years. This is also an occasion for us to look at the obstacles that have prevented Indian consumers and Indian society from fully benefiting from the digital revolution,” Mr. Ambani said.
 Interestingly, while Reliance Jio does not have any 2G network, the other two private operators — Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — have a significant base of 2G subscribers.
 Mr. Mittal added, “Telecom resources like spectrum, levies should not become a source for the exchequer, but should become a force multiplier in ensuring economic momentum becomes faster and gets accelerated. So, the government can earn its dues from other industries who are going to be riding —on the back of this wonderful industry,” Mr. Mittal said.

Alan Parker hizo muchísimas películas maravillosas. Simplemente maravillosas. Un talento enorme. Como estoy seguro que sabéis. DEP Alan Parker', escribió en sus redes sociales el director Nick Murphy.
 El productor David Puttnam confesó, por su parte, que 'siempre' estuvo 'impresionado' por el 'talento' de Parker, su 'amigo más antiguo y cercano'.
 'Mi vida y la de muchos otros que lo quisieron nunca será igual', agregó Puttnam, quien produjo alguna de las mejores películas de Parker, como 'Melody' (1971) o 'El expreso de Medianoche' (1978), por la que fue candidato a un Oscar como mejor director en 1978.
 Volvió a optar a la preciada estatuilla en la misma categoría en con 'Arde Mississippi' (1988), pero tampoco logró el preciado galardón como realizador, que se le resistió hasta el final de su carrera.
 Además de su maestría para crear atmósferas asfixiantes en filmes dramáticos, destacó en el difícil género del musical, con títulos aclamados como Bugsy Malone (1976), Fama (1980), Pink Floyd The Wall (1982), The Commitments (1991) y Evita (1996).
 En 2002, la reina Isabel II le concedió el título de Caballero del Imperio Británico por su contribución al mundo del arte y en 2013 recibió un premio honorífico durante la entrega de los Bafta, considerados como los Óscar británicos, en reconocimiento a toda su trayectoria.
 'Es casi imposible destacar un momento dado de su carrera, pero los increíbles 19 Baftas que sus películas han ganado demuestran la estima que le tienen sus compañeros, así como el carácter excepcional de su trabajo', destacó entonces el presidente de la Academia, John Willis.
 Parker estaba casado con Lisa Moran-Parker y tenía cinco hijos y siete nietos. EFE

Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson has fired a shot at his doubters, saying it's a fruitless exercise to try to push a divide at the club.
 Clarkson came under heavy criticism following Hawthorn's recent four-match losing run, leading to questions about whether it was time for him to leave the Hawks.
 Former Hawk Jordan Lewis, who played under Clarkson, was among the critics who questioned whether the four-time premiership coach was the right man to lead Hawthorn through their next rebuild.
 Clarkson is determined to see the job through, and he eased the pressure on himself by guiding his side to a 31-point win over Carlton in Perth on Friday.
 After the match, Clarkson made it clear that the recent criticism hadn't produced any cracks within Hawthorn's four walls.
 "The media has every right to ask the questions. We haven't been anywhere near our best over the last four weeks," Clarkson said.
 "But trying to push a divide between anyone at our football club is a fruitless exercise really, because we are so strong and tight from the board right through to the coaching area and the players.
 "We know where we are going. At the appropriate time, if we think we're not going in the right direction, we'll pivot and go in a different direction.
 "Those sort of nudges and pivots we have been making for 15 or 16 years and if we need to do so again, we will."
 Hawthorn trailed 31-0 after just 16 minutes before booting nine of the next 10 goals to post the 14.5 (89) to 9.4 (58) win.
 The victory boosted Hawthorn's record to 4-5 ahead of a clash with Fremantle on August 10 in Perth.
 Veteran Shaun Burgoyne is in doubt for that match after being taken off late against the Blues with hamstring tightness.
 "Given he's had history in that space before, we took the precaution," Clarkson said
 "If anything it's really slight, but given his history, we thought it's not worth taking the risk with him late. We need to see how he pulls up."
 Clarkson hopes the win over Carlton will be a turning point for his team.
 "It's just a small step for us. We've got a long way to go in this season," Clarkson said.
 "If we can get on a little bit of a roll in terms of playing consistent footy over a period of time, then teams will be very concerned coming up against our side, because they know our capability."
 Carlton skipper Patrick Cripps battled hard for 27 disposals, eight clearances and a goal, but he lacked support.
 "We didn't have enough guys get their job done today. As simple as that," Blues coach David Teague said.

Polish has been insisting on the version of the bomb explosion on board Lech Kaczynski's aircraft since 2016. To search for traces of explosives, the bodies of the victims of the tragedy, including the body of Lech Kaczynski, had been exhumed. A number of Polish experts stated that the autopsies carried out had not confirmed the version of the explosion on board the aircraft.
 Russia denies the version about the explosions. Svetlana Petrenko, an official spokesperson for the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, noted that such statements were yet another awkward attempt to question the obvious.
 According to Petrenko, no traces of explosives were found either on the fragments of the Tu-154M aircraft, or on the remains of the dead. Moreover, the substances that are not typical for the materials of structural elements of the aircraft and the products of its operation were not found either. Petrenko stressed that the Russian investigation had no doubts about the circumstances of the plane crash. Given the difficult weather conditions at the moment of landing, the aircraft captain should have decided to take the aircraft to an alternate airfield, but he chose not to. It was the subsequent erroneous actions of the crew that continued the landing operation under conditions of zero visibility and did not respond to the terrain awareness and warning system that caused the tragedy to occur, Russian investigators believe.

MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The shooting death in broad daylight of a Black man affectionately known in his Milwaukee neighborhood as “The Ras” so far has mystified police and spurred prominent conservatives in Wisconsin to speculate he was killed because of his support for President Donald Trump. Bernell Trammell was killed outside his office on July 23. Trammell supported reelecting Trump, but also the Black Lives Matter movement, a Black Democratic candidate for mayor and other liberals. The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party has called for a federal investigation to determine whether the killing was politically motivated.

MORTON -- Kristen Syndram's thriving photography business came to a screeching halt this spring because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 So she decided to take a leap of faith with another passion.
   
 That passion is tropical house plants. She has hundreds of them in her Morton home, many with names.
   
 "You're more invested in your plants' survival when you give them names," she said.
   
 With people staying home more now because of the pandemic, Syndram thought the time was right to open a tropical house plant store while continuing with her 5-year-old photography business.
   
 Your Plant Mum, 203 W. Jefferson St., in Morton, will have a grand opening from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday.
   
 "I'm excited about opening the store," Syndram said. "I'm also anxious about opening a second small business during a pandemic.
   
 "I decided to go for it because there's a need for a tropical house plant store in the area, where you can find healthy, rare, and tried and true plants."
   
 Syndram said there are fantastic nurseries and florists in the area, "but tropical house plants are a whole other ballgame. The only options are big box stores or online orders, where you cross your fingers and hope for no shipping damage."
   
 When Syndram's photography business was in high gear, she was shooting 12 to 15 weddings a year.
   
 Some were out-of-town weddings in Chicago, St. Louis, California, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Washington, and she went overseas to Greece.
   
 Syndram said she's done "one or two weddings" since the pandemic began, with most couples opting to postpone their nuptials, reschedule for next year or hope for the best in the fall.
   
 It was on a work trip to Chicago earlier this year that Syndram found and checked out a tropical house plant store in the Windy City.
   
 "It was such a cool place," she said.
   
 With that memory driving her, she began selling tropical house plants in early May after her photography business slowed. That tentative start quickly transitioned into open house sales in her garage each Monday that usually resulted in a sellout, she said.
   
 Syndram learned about the West Jefferson space in Morton from a photography colleague, and thought it would be great to open a tropical house plant store in the village where she grew up.
   
 To prepare for Saturday's grand opening, Syndram has sold tropical house plants at the Morton Farmers Market 'N More, done a couple pop-up shops in coffee shops, and had a few informal open houses at her store.
   
 "My only disappointment so far is my store is along with the parade route for the Morton Pumpkin Festival parade, and there won't be a parade this year," she said.
   
 Your Plant Mum will be open from 3 to 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. The phone number is 370-8699.
   
 The store hours are limited because Syndram wants to leave time for photography.
   
 She also does photography sessions for engagements and for families, but she said the sessions have dropped from three or four per month to three or four since March.
   
 Syndram, 29, is a 2012 graduate of Illinois State University, where she earned a bachelor's degree in public relations.

_Vanity Fair_ , Eban reports, has obtained a copy of an invoice from the company Cogna Technology Solutions that "noted a total order of 3.5 million tests for an amount owed of $52 million."
 "The tests' mysterious provenance would spark confusion and finger-pointing," Eban notes. "An Abu Dhabi–based artificial intelligence company, Group 42, with close ties to the UAE's ruling family, identified itself as the seller of 3.5 million tests and demanded payment. Its requests were routed through various divisions within Health and Human Services, whose lawyers sought in vain for a bona fide contracting officer."
 Kushner, according to Eban, "oversaw a secret project to devise a comprehensive plan that would have massively ramped up and coordinated testing for COVID-19 at the federal level." But a participant, quoted anonymously, told Vanity Fair that the plan "just went poof into thin air."Trump has been claiming that the U.S. has the most comprehensive, efficient and widely available coronavirus testing program in the world. But that claim is wildly inaccurate: during the recent coronavirus surge, there have been numerous reports of people waiting much too long for their test results.
 In the U.S., Eban observes, "Cable news and front pages have been dominated by images of miles-long lines of cars in scorching Arizona and Texas heat, their drivers waiting hours for scarce diagnostic tests, and desperate Sun Belt mayors pleading in vain for federal help to expand testing capacity."

According to the Polish version, the first explosion destroyed the left wing of the aircraft. Then a second bomb went off planted next to the so-called "general's compartment" in the central part of the liner. It was the second explosion that supposedly killed all the high-ranking passengers in this compartment of the airplane.
 Polish experts deny the version about the collision with the ground, having claimed that their extensive evidential base, including countless experiments and analyses contradict to such version.  The report also says that Russian investigators took steps to conceal the true causes of the plane crash.
 The Polish commission claims that the presence of traces of explosives on board - TNT, pentrite and RDX (hexogen) - was confirmed by experts of US and British laboratories where the analyses were carried out. It was noted that traces of explosives were found in the samples that were taken from parts of the aircraft that Russian technicians had replaced during the repairs of Tu-154 N 101 (Kaczynski's aircraft) and Tu-154 N 102 (another Polish-owned aircraft) in 2009.

"Wasn't my best pitch, obviously," Kelly said. "I guess they didn't take too kind to a curveball. It is what it is."
 Nobody, of course, wants to see Bregman, Correa or any other player hurt, and the good news is they weren't. Nobody was even hit, which makes a suspension for the equivalent of 22 games of a real season a bit mystifying.
 It seems Kelly, as anyone who watched the video of him breaking a window at his house on an errant pitch, sometimes struggles with his control.
 Ironically, the pandemic is partly to blame for the dust-up even happening this year. The Astros and Dodgers weren't supposed to meet on the original 2020 schedule, something that upset Dodger fans so much they had planned to go to Anaheim and boo the team when they played the Angels.
 Just as upsetting has been the lack of contrition on the part of the Astros, who offered half-hearted apologies during spring training for a scheme that won them a World Series. At first defiant, they later said they were sorry if anyone was offended by what they had done, though they didn't seem terribly sorry about anything.
 And while the scheme cost both the team's manager and general manager their jobs, it's important to remind everyone that the players — unlike Kelly — never paid a price at all.
 No suspension, no fine, no nothing.
 The price they paid Tuesday night wasn't much, but it was something. The Astros were exposed for the cheaters they are, Baker got a fine and fans everywhere were reminded that the Astros didn't deserve their world title.
 Give Kelly — who wasn't even on the 2017 Dodgers — credit for not letting it die so quickly. And give him a pat on the back for making us care, at least for one night, about a "regular'' season that has so many teams making the playoffs that it means nothing.
 Meanwhile, after the field cleared, it was back to the same new normal. Fake noises but mostly just the sound of ball hitting glove and bat hitting ball.
 So quiet that you could almost hear the sound of a garbage can banging somewhere in the clubhouse.

Giunti sul posto per effettuare i tamponi del caso e per capire se l'uomo giunto in Sicilia via New York lo scorso 22 luglio fosse positivo al Covid, i sanitari hanno scoperto che il turista era uscito a fare una passeggiata. Dopo un fitto rastrellamento del centro, le forze dell’ordine, sono riuscite a rintracciare l'uomo in Piazza Politeama affidandolo alle cure dei sanitari. Il turista in via precauzionale è stato portato all’ospedale Ingrassia e sottoposto a tampone, risultato poi negativo. Da successivi controlli i sanitari hanno appurato che il turista americano aveva solo avuto una lieve intossicazione alimentare.

Foreign investors will face tough national security checks designed to protect Australia's critical assets from falling into the wrong hands.
 Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has released the first section of the draft laws, which will go to parliament later this year, as Australia's relations with China are already on the rocks.
 The first section out for consultation deals with the definition of "national security business" and the second - to be released in September - will cover with other regulatory changes.
 The changes mirror similar regimes introduced in the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and New Zealand.
 The rules would apply to foreign bids for technology, telecommunications and energy companies, as well as small-scale defence and services firms.
 No minimum dollar threshold will be needed to trigger the national security test.
 The treasurer will have expanded powers to force the sale of assets or impose conditions after a deal is reached if national security is at risk.
 Currently, private foreign investments under $275 million - or $1.2 billion for countries that have free trade agreements with Australia - are not screened.
 Australia's foreign allies and state and territory leaders have been briefed on the reforms.
 More than $13 billion of foreign investment in Australia last financial year came from China.
 The US with $58 billion was the biggest source of investment, ahead of Canada, Singapore, Japan, with China in fifth place.
 The Foreign Investment Review Board has more than 1000 conditional approvals on their books.
 About 80 per cent of approvals last year had conditions attached.
 As part of the reforms, the government is also streamlining approvals for non- sensitive businesses.
 It is expected the laws will come into force from January 1.

A solid, hands-on education in agriculture was so important to Hampton Beard that he decided to drive nearly 300 miles from Kingstree every day to attend classes at the Piedmont Technical College (PTC) Saluda Campus and study diversified agriculture with instructor Roger Estridge.
 That’s about five hours of driving a day, even though there was a program much closer to home.
 “I heard about this program and how much hands-on experience you get, so I decided to come out and visit the campus in Saluda County,” Beard said.
 Estridge took him on a tour. “We hit it off right away. I knew after I talked to Roger that this is where I needed to be," Beard said.
 Beard, who graduated this spring, already is an experienced farmer. He’s worked in the field for about five years, growing crops on 30 acres at first and expanding over time to 83 acres. But that’s small potatoes compared to where he plans to be next year and beyond ― growing cotton, soybeans and corn on up to 700 acres.
 “My granddad has a farm. When he said he wanted to retire,” the 20-year-old said, “I tried to change his mind. But he retired in 2013 and leased his land to a fellow who is my neighbor now.”
 Undeterred, Beard gradually was able to persuade his grandfather to come out of retirement the next year as his business partner.
 “I am going to help my granddad take back over his 700-acre row crop farm. Me and my granddad are going to work it together,” he said. “There will be another fellow helping us, so there will be three of us to start.”
 For now, Beard is working for M3 Farms in Kingstree, where he has been employed while in school. It’s a huge operation.
 “Roger actually brought our class on a field trip here (at M3),” he said. “We toured a cotton gin. We went from there to the field and were picking cotton later that day. Everyone got to ride the cotton-picker. It’s a John Deere CP690. It cuts out a bunch of the harvesting labor.”
 Beard said he has learned a lot in the program and has been successful precisely because of its hands-on focus. “That’s what I love about it,” he said. “You can apply your new skills right away.”
 In addition to common pests such as the stink bug, which can devastate cotton plants, and the costs for equipment, Beard worries about commodity prices. The markets can be sporadic because ofthe weather and other economic impacts.
 “When I planted cotton last year, I kept looking at the market about three to four times a day,” he said. “You have to have a committed price that you want to sell it at. Cotton has been going down. It was about a dollar a pound. Then it dipped to 61 cents per pound. I figured I could break even at 69.5 cents a pound. I usually can harvest as much as 800 pounds an acre.”
 The PTC Diversified Agriculture Program this past spring included three dual enrollment students. Their hands-on activities have included building “cold houses” to grow vegetables in the winter and constructing stalls and holding pens. Beard’s classmates echoed his positive sentiments about the program.
 Former Marine John Wendell, 25, of Laurens, said he has always been interested in agriculture. His family has a small farm where he helped out as a child. He said he appreciates Estridge’s ability to relate even conceptual lessons to the real world. Estridge gives a common piece of advice to all of his students: “Always ask for help. He is very keen on safety and being careful."
 Classmate Heather Fields, 21, of Abbeville, also expressed an appreciation for Estridge’s open-door policy.
 “’Ag Calculation’ is the first class coming into the program,” she said.
 Fields found the subject especially difficult to master. “He makes sure you understand it. It’s all math. And he always tells us to ask for help," she said.
 Makayla Porter, 18, of Saluda, said she knew throughout high school she wanted to study agriculture.
 “My grandpa was a livestock buyer in Saluda. In the summer, I would go with him to auctions. My family has always been in agriculture,” Porter said. “This fall, I am applying to Clemson to study agribusiness and mechanization. I decided the mechanical side of it was my thing. My dad is a diesel mechanic. That is where I get it from.”
 Porter had high praise for Estridge. “He is really good at what he does,” she said. “He makes it relate to life somehow but also gives you the book stuff. That makes it better.”
 In mid-March, Beard’s lengthy commute was eliminated because of pandemic social distancing policies. The change did not faze him.
 “It wasn’t as bad as I thought,” he said. “I still would rather drive all the way to go to class than study online, but I just made it work. I could schedule the study time around my job, so I was making money and still going to school every day.”
 So what’s the best thing about the farming lifestyle?
 “It’s dark outside when I get up, and it’s dark outside when I go to bed,” Beard said, “but I love it. I always have. I grew up around it. If you are going to do it, you have got to love it.”

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - After a couple of days of mostly cloudy skies and slow-moving storms, we'll invite more sunshine and warmer temperatures into the region this weekend. Most of Friday’s storms will be center on neighborhoods west of I-77 and north of I-40. A few storms will likely move further east and south shortly before or after sunset, however, they’ll be scattered at best. Afternoon highs are back in the low to mid-90s this afternoon across the Piedmont and Foothills as temperatures will likely top out in the 80s across the Mountains today.&nbsp;Jonathan Stacey's Friday afternoon forecastThe high heat and opportunity for a few scattered late-day pop-up storms remain in the forecast Saturday and Sunday before more widespread showers and storms filter through the Carolinas Monday. High temperatures will stay in the low to mid-90s through the weekend but will back off into the upper 80s as cloudy skies and wet weather takes center stage for the first part of next week.Hurricane Isaias is forecast to be near the Central Bahamas tonight, and move near or over the Northwestern Bahamas Saturday and near the east coast of the Florida peninsula Saturday afternoon through Sunday. &nbsp;Isaias is drifting around the periphery of a massive Atlantic ridge of high pressure – the Bermuda high – that will govern its motion for a few more days. While the storm is expected to come eerily close to the U.S. mainland, increased shear is expected to weaken the storm to a degree over the weekend. We’ll be paying close attention to Isaias moves further north towards the Carolinas’ coast. Landfall along the North Carolina coast Monday isn’t out of the question, but over the next 36-48 hours we’ll get a more accurate picture of the potential impacts for the along the coast. There is a high risk for rip currents along the coast starting today continuing through the first part of the week as Isaias is already producing large swells. Remember, to only swim at beaches where lifeguards are present and if you are not a strong swimmer, you might want to consider just getting your feet wet.First Alert Meteorologist Jonathan StaceyCopyright 2020 WBTV.

A broad-based effort, begun by the Boston Musicians Association, wants to address the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performing arts.
 Immediate Relief offers just that--money for freelancers in the music world. Temporarily administered through the national Sweet Relief effort, the newly established New England Musicians Relief Fund wants to help now, and build resources for the future.
 The pandemic shutdown has made every musician scramble to survive financially, and with the first round of federal support expiring, that survival becomes even more precarious.
 "The first person any musician calls are the officers of the union," says Gabriel Langfur Rice, himself a trombonist in the Rhode Island Philharmonic, active freelancer with other Boston-area organizations, and union board member.
 "The BMA immediately began gathering resources to pass on to musicians," he says. "They became experts on the unemployment system. And we looked for partner organizations, to connect musicians with relief money, and to create a way for people with money to help and have it be tax deductible."
 Ultimately, the scope of the need required expanding outside union resources. Rice helped create a broader-based committee to explore possibilities. Comprising freelance musicians, industry executives, patrons and union members, the committee recommended an initial alliance with Sweet Relief, which has been facilitating musician support for decades.
 Sweet Relief's already established COVID-19 Fund pays bills for qualifying musicians. Amounts vary on specific needs.
 "Sweet Relief had the infrastructure and capability to work with us right away," Rice says. "They have a mechanism to decide who is eligible, and how to provide tax benefits to those who want to give. They pay a bill, or part of a bill, a credit, a landlord or a utility."
 Initial applications and donations will be handled directly by Sweet Relief. The NEMRF organization is finalizing its own 501(c)3 status, with the help of the Boston Arts and Business Council. When that happens, the New England-based organization will administer funds.
 "This is not a union initiative," Rice says. "And it's certainly not just aimed at union musicians.
 "For lots of reasons, we want our reach to extend beyond the community of the union, beyond the classical and academic worlds, to reach church musicians, those on the club circuit and in rock bands."
 A freelancer himself, Rice understands the urgency in a personal way. "This took a long time to organize, and I wish we could have done it quicker.
 "We are hearing about a lot of musicians who didn't qualify for unemployment," he says. "A lot of us have mixed income, some W2 and some schedule C. Some fall smack in the middle, or they are qualifying with a very low income level.
 "The best advice I can give anyone is keep looking for all the possible resources," he says. "And we're asking musicians to tell their non-musician friends about this new way to help out."
 Musicians can apply to the Immediate Relief campaign at the COVID-19 Fund - Sweet Relief site: www.sweetrelief.org/covid-19-fund.html. Donations can be made at sweetrelief.nemrf.org.

By Howard Fischer   Capitol Media Services
 PHOENIX -- Gov. Doug Ducey said the state won't make up the money that Arizona unemployed will lose when the $600 a week in extra federal benefits dries up this coming week.
 In fact, the governor said that he has no interest in raising the state's own jobless benefits from the current $240 a week, the second lowest cap in the country. He said that in normal times -- meaning before the pandemic -- there were plenty of jobs out there for people to find "at any time.''
 A more immediate problem faces the approximately 452,000 Arizonans who collected some form of unemployment compensation this past week.   That program expires this week. And Congress has yet to approve either an extension or, if nothing else, some scaled-back plan.
 Of that total Arizonans getting a check, the Department of Economic Security reports about 255,000 were getting only Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. That is the $600 a week Congress agreed to provide for individuals who do not qualify for regular state jobless benefits, including the self-employed.   Absent congressional action, they will get nothing this coming week.
 The balance are those in the regular state unemployment system. That covers those who, through no fault of their own, became unemployed.
 By law, they are entitled to one-half of what they were earning. But state lawmakers, at the behest of the business community, have capped payments at $240 a week, no matter how much the person was earning before, a figure that has not be altered since 2004.   Only Mississippi pays less.
 With no congressional action, those state checks of no more than $240 will be all they get.   The governor said that's not his problem.   "I want to just say as clearly as I can that Congress needs to act,'' Ducey said. "This is on Congress.''
 Anyway, he said, the state does not have the kind of money it would take to backfill the loss of federal dollars on any sustained basis.
 With 452,000 collecting benefits, making up that $600 a week would cost the state more than $270 million a week.
 "In Arizona, we live by a balanced budget,'' Ducey said. "And we don't have the ability to print money.''
 Borrowing, the governor said, is not an option. That, he said, leaves the issue in the lap of federal lawmakers who have yet to reach a deal.
 "If I have any advice for Congress it would be to turn around, order sandwiches in, stay the weekend and figure this out,'' he said.
 And what of the people who find themselves with only $240 a week next week -- or nothing?   The governor said it's not that dire.
 "We've worked very hard to ensure that Arizonans have resources that are necessary and that people are not losing a place where they live or their home,'' Ducey said. That refers to programs which for the time being forbid the eviction of tenants affected directly or indirectly by COVID-19 as well as some funds set aside to prevent foreclosure on mortgages.
 In the meantime, the governor said he sees no reason to address the issue of unemployment benefits.
 "We're not at that point,'' he said.   That still leaves the question of the adequacy of the state's own benefits.   "Could you exist on $240 a week?'' the governor was asked.
 "We've been working with the federal government on this,'' was Ducey's response. And he said there are other priorities in the state, including working with foster children and the developmentally disabled.
 Any increase in state benefits would not affect the budget or raise taxes.
 Instead, unemployment compensation is financed through a trust fund financed by a tax paid by employers on each worker's first $7,000 of salary. Rates range from 0.05 percent to 12.85 percent, based on how often each firm's workers end up collecting benefits because they have been laid off or fired through no fault of their own.
 If the fund gets depleted, then the state automatically raises what employers pay.
 Ducey said there's really no reason to even discuss the issue of that $240 cap.
 "It's a hypothetical question because unemployment wasn't really an issue before the pandemic,'' he said.
 For February and the first three weeks of March, the number of Arizonans collecting benefits fluctuated between 17,593 and 18,854, with the fund paying out about $3 million a week. Ducey said that a few thousand people signed up every month and "a few thousand people falling off.''   And Ducey said as far as he was concerned, there is no problem with that $240 cap.   "Those 17,000 people could all find a job at that point in time at any time,'' the governor said. "We had more jobs available than people to fill them.''
 Ducey said he understands that "people have to use the social safety net for different reasons along the way.''
 "But in terms of employment being available, that was there in February and early March,'' he said.

In a monologue from the movie Field of Dreams film-watchers are reminded that “Baseball has marked time.” Fandom provides entertainment, a measure of belonging and most importantly, a short but necessary distraction and respite from the daily grind. “It reminds us of all that once was good and could be again.”
 I waited most of the fall and winter for a 162-game season, anticipating a spring and summer chocked full of compelling story lines, accompanying the rhythm and action of the National Pastime. My favorite team, the Chicago Cubs, ended last season in turmoil. The Cubs enter this campaign with many unanswered questions and a new skipper in the dugout.
 Alas, the global pandemic delayed baseball’s Opening Day for nearly four months. Normally, a source of boundless joy, this year, my thoughts were accompanied by twinges of consternation. Revised plans for a compact 60-game season, played in 66 days, included games in ballparks without fans, expanded rosters, modified schedules, temporary rule changes and expanded playoffs. There are several challenges unique to this season in addition to the issues which manager’s routinely face.
 Of course, logistics and the virus’s effects on the game are secondary to the health and safety of the public, stadium workers, as well as the players. As I reflected on the millions of cases of COVID-19, I began to wonder if there was going to be a season at all. For the first time in my life, I considered if there should be. I realize the impact sports has on our national psyche and economic benefit, but the importance of sports paled in comparison to the reality in the United States today.
 Blake Snell, a 2017 American League Cy Young Award-winning Pitcher, stirred controversy when he stated that he didn’t want to risk his health for reduced pay. A small group of other players chose to opt out of the 2020 season citing COVID-19 health concerns, for themselves or their families. Other players have already tested positive since the season began only a few days ago.
 I’m under no illusion that this season will go smoothly. There will be outbreaks which may curtail or cause the cancellation of an already abbreviated season. That said, baseball fans will get used to the quieter stadiums and rule changes and eventually settle into the new normal which includes baseball.
 Inside Wrigley Field Friday night, television cameras outnumbered people. The faithful were practicing social distancing on rooftops across the street. Seeing people peering into a cathedral of baseball located at the corner of Clark and Addison, proved that baseball is able to provide a distraction when little else has.
 Empty stadiums will eventually be full again. Some day we will reach for a hotdog and cheer as a baserunner rounds third base heading for home. We’ll talk about great players and plays with strangers in seat beside us. Until then, we can spend our time with the people and things we love. For many that includes watching the boys of summer play ball.

A pub in southwest NSW and its licensee have copped fines after taking "no steps" to comply with COVID-19 heath orders.
 The Temora establishment was fined $5000 and its licensee $1000 for non- compliance with public health orders after police attended about 12.30pm on Thursday.
 Police said the pub had no sign-in book and that "no steps had been taken" to comply with the ministerial directions designed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
 Meanwhile, the Harpoon & Hotel Harry in Surry Hills, Matinee Coffee in Marrickville and Tan Viet in Cabramatta have all been closed for deep cleaning and contact tracing.
 Harris Farm Market in Leichhardt and Darlo Bar in Darlinghurst also confirmed they were both frequented on July 26 by people who have since tested positive to COVID-19.
 The Harris Farm store has been deep cleaned, and Darlo Bar reopens on Saturday after being closed for cleaning.
 A positive case, the same person who attended The Apollo restaurant in Potts Point, went to the Harpoon and Hotel Harry pub on July 26.
 A person with the coronavirus went to the Marrickville cafe on July 26 and 27, while another was at the Cabramatta restaurant on July 23.
 NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant on Friday said authorities had found the COVID-19 link between the two Thai Rock restaurants at Wetherill Park and Potts Point - subsequently introduced to The Apollo.
 "We know most transmission events occur in an indoor environment, we know household-type gatherings are more likely to transmit," Dr Chant told 2GB radio.
 "Think twice about having those gatherings up to 20 and minimise your contacts with others and minimise social events and movements just at this period while we're putting out spot fires."
 Hygiene marshals will be required at NSW gyms from Saturday to ensure equipment is cleaned, hand sanitiser is available and social distancing is maintained, while gyms will need to register a COVID-safe plan.
 The uptick in Sydney cases has prompted Queensland to ban all Greater Sydney residents from entering the state from Saturday.

Douglas County's health director said Friday that the Nebraska Attorney General's Office challenged her ability to implement a mask requirement in Omaha, so she is backing off her plan to do so.
 Adi Pour said she will continue to review data every day, "but for now, I have to trust everybody in this community to do the right thing moving ahead."
 Pour said last week that she thought it was time to require masks in indoor public spaces in Omaha.
 "We need to get our cases under control if we want to get our schools open," Pour said at a press briefing with Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert last Thursday.
 Stothert, who was at the Friday briefing where Pour announced the decision, said wearing a mask is very important and will control the spread of the coronavirus. But she said wearing a mask will be "a simple request we want to make to citizens of Omaha," not a requirement.

_Peninsula_ and STX’s upcoming _Greenland_ (about Gerard Butler trying to save his family as a potential extinction-level comet races toward Earth) are more impactful than they might have been under conventional circumstances. As for the notion, detailed in _Peninsula_ , of a nation being closed off from the world due to being unable to contain a viral threat, well, I don’t expect to be flying out of the United Sates anytime soon.  Both films contain (in the first act) scenes where protagonists must turn a blind eye and keep driving as people beg them to stop and taxi them to potential safety. When the world is on fire, decency can be a luxury.

 President Donald Trump has had two separate coronavirus task forces: the White House task force that is headed by Vice President Mike Pence and includes medical experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, and a private sector-oriented task force headed by Jared Kushner — a White House senior adviser and the president's son in law. Kushner, according to _Vanity Fair_ 's Katherine Eban, launched a coronavirus testing plan back in the spring. But as a July 30 article by Eban explains, things did not go well at all.
 During a three-month period, Eban notes, "more than 2.4 million Americans contracted COVID-19, and 123,331 of them died of the illness — first in New York, and then in states around the country. Governors, public health experts and frightened citizens sounded the alarm that a critical shortage of tests and the ballooning time to get results were crippling the U.S. pandemic response. But the million tests, some of which were distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to several states, were of no help. According to documents obtained by _Vanity Fair_ , they were examined in two separate government laboratories and found to be 'contaminated and unusable.'"

Editor's note: The _Daily Sun_ is featuring the best and most versatile athletes in the Golden Circle and we are showcasing a different athlete in every edition and online to highlight the GC's Best.
 Today's athlete is Corsicana senior Lara Bwicheilug, who has made a name for herself on the volleyball court and exploded on the soccer scene last year when she made her debut in a brand new sport and soared to heights no one could have imagined.
 Not only did Lara pick up the new game on the fly as a junior in high school, but she ended up becoming Corsicana's starting goalkeeper and then shocked the district with her courage and outstanding play to earn the district's Goalkeeper MVP award.
 And that was only the first big step in her postseason rewards. Lara went on to earn Class 5A All-State honors when she was named to the honorable mention list to the 5A team.
 She didn't even start in goal at the beginning of the season, but she was sensational when she took over in the net. Lara played in 5 1/2 district games and saved 100 of 125 shots to lead the Lady Tigers, who had four players earn first-and-second-team All-District honors, including sophomore Fernanda Zagal (first-team), senior Paola Cedillo (second-team) and junior Jackie Cuevas (second-team).
