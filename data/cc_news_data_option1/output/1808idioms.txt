 It was recalled that the late Lt. Cmdr. Hilan V. Ebert was honored posthumously in May 1944 when a new fighting destroyer escort, christened the USS Ebert, splashed down in Tampa, Florida. Ebert, a native of Alliance who was killed when the USS Northampton was attacked and sunk north of Guadalcanal Nov. 30, 1943, was born in Alliance in 1903. He attended Alliance High and the Marion Institute in Alabama before entering the U.S. Naval Academy in 1922 and graduating in 1926. He was also posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for heroism aboard the USS Northampton for giving his life while carrying out his duties while the ship was under attack. He was to have been advanced to the rank of commander, but died before the official announcement was made. He was survived by his mother, Blanche Ebert, who lived in the 2000 block of Ridgewood Avenue; his wife and two sons, Scott III (named in honor of Lt. Cmdr. Ebert's late father) and David Parker, who were living in the 2200 block of Shunk Avenue.  
 The story of Sgt. Phillip Clark, Alliance's first native son to win the Distinguished Service Cross in World War II, was also retold. Clark was one of 22 members of the "fighting" First Division to be awarded the nation's second- highest military honor by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for wiping out a machine gun nest in Normandy on D-Day. The Alliance High graduate and former employee of the Alliance Brick Co., had also received a Soldier's Medal for his actions in July 1943 in Sicily when he saved the lives of two fellow soldiers who were sleeping near a fuel dump when it caught fire and ignited their clothing. Clark wrapped them in blankets and carried them to safety. The son of Mr. and Mrs Charles A. Clark and husband of Mrs. Helen Mills Clark, who were all living in the first block of East Prospect Street, he also had a brother, Capt. Leonard Clark, pilot of a Liberator in the Pacific who held a Distinguished Flying Cross.

Google announced that “how to brew homemade alcohol” was amongst their top internet searches in South Africa and it is almost impossible due to demand to find brewing yeast in supermarkets.
 South African Breweries have also just announced that it will have to pour 400 million bottles of beer down the drain as they are not allowed to transport it to their bottling plants.
 President Ramaphosa however is refusing all calls to relax the hugely unpopular alcohol or cigarette bans despite the colossal loss to the struggling country in taxation revenue.
 Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said earlier this week: “I don’t like the ban on alcohol and tobacco. I lost the debate in Cabinet and therefore I must toe the line or I must leave the Cabinet”.

Review
 HOPE GAP (2020)
 Annette Bening, Bill Nighy, Josh O'Connor, Sally Rogers
 Directed by William Nicholson
 Films about divorce can be devastating, as we’ve seen with Noah Baumbach’s “Marriage Story.” In “Hope Gap” the fervent drive to separate by Scarlett Johansson or stay together by Adam Driver is missing, in fact you could say that passion is nowhere to be seen in the film by screenwriter/director William Nicholson. Still, every couple is different. In this case, Annette Bening plays the wife who’s just learned that her husband (Bill Nighy) is leaving her for another woman after 29 years of marriage. The storyline gets frustrating but the performances by the veteran actors are first-rate as is a welcomed Josh O’Connor (the smiling vicar from “Emma”) as their son.
 Bill Nighy plays Edward, a schoolteacher who begins having an affair with a student’s mother (Sally Rogers), after being married to his domineering wife Grace (Annette Bening) for almost three decades. To be fair, almost any actress would appear domineering opposite Nighy, a terrific actor whose subdued temperament is part of his charm.
 Watching Edward and Grace interact in the moments before he drops the bombshell that he’s leaving, it’s easy to see why he feels it’s time to jump ship instead of fighting to save the marriage. We don’t need to see flashbacks of the couple’s happier times to illustrate the disintegration of their union, being together for so long is testament enough that there were plenty of joyous occasions.
 Nicholson’s screenplay makes it obvious that the marriage has become one- sided. Edward is made to feel that everything he does is wrong. Grace has a condescending tone when she speaks to her husband as if she’s interacting with a child. It’s not mean-spirited and in her mind, a gesture of affection, but Edward is left feeling incompetent. When Grace smiles and sips her wine, she’s asks Edward “We’re happy, aren’t we?” and he responds “Yes, we’re fine” without making eye contact. He’s not being honest with her and there lies the complexity of the situation which gives the film it’s driving force.
 Edward calls the couple’s grown son Jamie (Josh O'Connor), who’s experience his own relationship problems, to come down for a visit and then breaks the news that he’s going to leave his mother. Sure, Jamie is shocked, but he takes the news rather well (I love British people) as if he understands that his father would only do this as a last resort. Nicholson’s story suggests that Jamie is on the path to follow in his father’s footsteps, and that's supported by O’Connor’s voiceover narration.
 The plan is for Edward to tell Grace that he’s leaving her while Jamie’s down so he can help his mother cope with the news. When that moment comes, Bening jumps into fine form once again as she refuses to give up on the marriage, “You can’t just walk away after 29 years, you have to try!” to which Edward replies “I have for 29 years.” It’s a cheap shot and not true which he finally admits.
 The film’s focal point becomes Bening’s platform to showcase her skills. Grace begins to admit to being domineering and we watch her refuse to believe that Edward is gone for good. Her life is filled with self-pity, even blaming God for abandoning her. Despite Grace’s overbearing tone, you can’t put the blame entirely on her. Edward never spoke to her about his true feelings over the years, nor is he giving her a chance to fight for the marriage. He seems himself as a chivalrous knight willing to sacrifice the marriage in order to make Grace happy, because obviously he can’t give her what she wants. But is he really just being selfish in order to find his own happiness?
 Based on the director’s personal life as he watched his parent’s go through a breakup, the film is genuine and intimate. Anna Valdez-Hanks’ cinematography showcasing the scenic landscape with its sprawling seaside cliffs, along with Alex Heffes’ haunting score, helps balance the film’s grief with bursts of beauty. “Hope Gap” can be frustrating to watch at times, but Nicholson’s layered and complex screenplay along with the performances by the actors make this a rewarding experience.
