BELMONT -- Pessimistic prognosticators might have predicted otherwise, but Allegany County's sales tax revenue continued to climb in 2019.


   


  Treasurer Terri Ross noted the county's year-end figures during the first Budget Committee meeting of 2020. Allegany County brought in $22,091,356.04 in net receipts during 2019, beating the budgeted projection and marking an increase over 2018.


   


  The county still came out in the black after the state vacuumed up $309,564 for Aid and Incentives for Municipalities (AIM) funding, which was shifted to the counties in 2019.


   


  "Prior to the AIM capture we were up 4.8%. If we deduct the AIM payment we were up 3.4%, or $734,000 over what we received last year," Ross said. "Budgetary-wise, we were $1.9 million over our projected budget for 2019."


   


  The $309,564 for the AIM program went to Allegany County towns; the county expects the deduction for local villages May 7. In 2019, the state shifted AIM funding onto counties using new sales tax revenue captured from internet sales that had previously gone untaxed.


   


  Internet revenue likely played a factor in Allegany County's robust sales tax figures, which have been on an upward trend the last several years. The county's coffers have remained full despite the high-profile closure of its sole big box department store, Kmart, early in 2019.


   


  The holiday season was successful, with the final payment of 2019 up about $400,000 compared to 2018.


   


  2020 got off to a sluggish start, however, with the first payment coming in $30,562.38 below the same period in 2019.


   


  On a related note, Ross said the county's finances received a clean bill of health from the comptroller's fiscal stress report for 2018 and she expects the same for 2019.


   


  The report takes into account factors like fund balance, level of debt and economic impact.


   


  "That's where we've had a grade, so to speak, as far as businesses going out," Ross said of the latter. "That plays a role."


   


  Board Chairman Curt Crandall said the county's finances have improved dramatically, noting at one point some legislators "were ready to throw in the towel and have a control board come in and take over Allegany County."


   


  "Through hard work and determination, changes made over a period of time financially put us in a lot better position here in Allegany County," Crandall said. "Things were turned around. I'm certainly glad we didn't throw in the towel and say let's let a control board come in and operate us versus us taking care of those things. We're certainly challenged with assessed values, population, and large industry, even more so now, but we've done very well in Allegany County government. I think we keep our finger on the pulse."

Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody is asking a federal judge to toss out a lawsuit filed by the National Rifle Association challenging gun legislation passed after the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 14 students and three faculty members.


  The national gun-rights group challenged part of a sweeping school-safety law that raised the age to purchase rifles and other long guns from 18 to 21.


  But, in a motion to dismiss the case filed Tuesday, Moody’s lawyers argued that the law doesn’t violate the Second Amendment because, while individuals who are between ages 18 and 21 cannot buy guns, they may still “keep and use” firearms “for any lawful purpose.”


  The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the higher minimum age to buy long guns, a restriction already in place for handguns, in part as a reaction to the Parkland school shooting. Accused killer Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school who was 19 years old at the time of the shooting, legally purchased the AR-15-style rifle that was used.


  The lawsuit, filed immediately following passage of the law in 2018, languished for more than a year in federal court but is back on track after the NRA dropped an attempt to keep secret the identities of two plaintiffs.


  The gun-rights organization alleges that the age restriction is an unconstitutional violation of people’s Second Amendment right to “purchase firearms to defend themselves, their families, and their homes.”


  “At 18 years of age, law-abiding citizens in this country are considered adults for almost all purposes and certainly for the purposes of the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights,” the NRA’s lawyers wrote in a brief filed in November. “At 18, citizens are eligible to serve in the military --- to fight and die by arms for the country.”


  But in the 36-page motion filed Tuesday, lawyers for Moody argued that Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker should dismiss the complaint “because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.”


  Noting that “a 19-year-old used a lawfully purchased firearm to kill 17 students and faculty members” at the Parkland school, Moody’s lawyers wrote that Florida legislators were “responding to that and other incidents of gun violence” when they crafted the statute.


  The state’s “age qualification is fully consistent with the historical understanding of the scope of the Second Amendment right,” the attorney general’s lawyers wrote.


  “Florida does not ban 18-to-20-year-olds from possessing firearms, and a prohibition on those individuals’ purchase of firearms expires once they reach 21. In light of the important governmental objective at stake and the carefully targeted age qualification, the statute easily passes intermediate scrutiny,” the standard by which it should be judged, the lawyers added.


  Moody’s lawyers also asked that she be dismissed from the case --- which names her and Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Rick Swearingen as defendants --- “because she is not authorized to enforce the challenged provision.”


  In the November court filing, the NRA argued the “age-based ban” imposes “a significant, unequal, and impermissible burden on the right to keep and bear arms of a class of millions of law-abiding 18-to-21-year-old citizens.”


  But in Tuesday’s motion, Moody’s legal team wrote that the statute “does not burden conduct within the scope of the Second Amendment,” and, even if it does, “it survives the applicable level of scrutiny.”


  “Any law-abiding person over the age of 18 may gift, loan, or allow the use of a firearm to an otherwise qualified person over the age of 18, who may in turn keep and use that firearm for any lawful purpose, including home defense, hunting, sport and practice shooting,” the motion said. “The sale-gift distinction is aimed at a uniquely dangerous problem --- the purchase of firearms by 18-to-20-year-olds absent the judgment of a parent, guardian, or other law-abiding adult that the individual is prepared for the responsibility of gun ownership.”


  Moody’s lawyers also said the law doesn’t violate equal protection rights, as the NRA argued, because there is a rational basis for the age classification.


  Finally, the attorney general’s lawyers argued that she has no authority to enforce the law. Instead, “it is the locally elected state attorney” who would prosecute violations of the law, they wrote.


  “The attorney general does have considerable authority to act in the public interest and, when necessary, to defend state statutes. She is the only official authorized to represent Florida’s state interests in federal court, and she may intervene in cases ‘in which the state may be a party, or in anywise interested.’ … But that authority is wholly discretionary,” her lawyers wrote. “And forcing the attorney general to defend the constitutionality of a statute would effectively eliminate her unreviewable discretion to intervene.”

NEW YORK -- For more than a decade, the rivalry in women's basketball was Tennessee and UConn.
   
 After a 13-year absence, the teams will play again Thursday night, with ESPN carrying the national broadcast from Hartford, Conn., at 6 p.m.
   
 The powerhouse teams led by Hall of Fame coaches Pat Summitt and Geno Auriemma put the sport on the national scene starting with their historic first matchup and No. 1 vs. No. 2 showdown in 1995. The Associated Press Top 25 poll usually would have come out that day before the game, but a decision was made to hold it off until afterward -- the only time that's happened in the history of the rankings.
   
 "It was the game. It was so intense," former Tennessee star Tamika Catchings said. "It was the game you got pumped up for. It was do or die in the basketball sense. It was the game you knew was coming and you prepared for in the first half of the season."
   
 The Huskies and Lady Vols played 22 times over a 12-year span, with each one being a circle the calendar type of game whether it was in Knoxville, Storrs, Conn., or the NCAA Tournament. UConn leads the all-time series 13-9, including 4-0 in the national championship game.
   
 The series ended after the 2007 season when Summitt called it off. Auriemma said at the time that Summitt had accused the Huskies of a recruiting violation. Summitt never went public into specifics about why she ended the series. Summitt died in 2016 at age 64 of Alzheimer's disease.
   
 "Pat was a woman of high principles. When she discontinued the series with Connecticut, I trusted it was for good reason," said former Lady Vols player Michelle Brooke-Marciniak. "Only Pat knows the real reasons she halted the series, and Pat took those reasons to the grave with her."
   
 When the teams played, it was must-see TV. Now that they are meeting again for a home-and-home set in the next two years, Auriemma knows that it will be different.
   
 "We turned that spigot off, let's turn it back on. It won't be the same," he said. "The coaching is different, the players are different, the media cycles are different. I don't think it should be (the same). If we're back to that, then you know what, we haven't made the progress we think we've made. … What's a bigger game this year, us and Oregon or us and Tennessee? Tennessee for the nostalgia stuff, Oregon for the real stuff."
   
 ESPN commentator Rebecca Lobo, who played in that first game in 1995 won by UConn, is excited the series is back, but isn't sure what will happen.
   
 "It's not what it used to be, and I don't know what it is until we see it on Thursday," she said. "Will it be that Thursday will come and go? Or will it be something more? I'm looking forward to seeing how it all plays out."
   
 Former Tennessee coach Holly Warlick, a longtime assistant of Summitt's who helped set up Thursday's game, told The AP that the reason she agreed to restart the series because it will benefit the Pat Summitt Foundation. Proceeds from both games will go to it, along with the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
   
 The Women's Basketball Hall of Fame also will receive proceeds from the 2020-21 meeting in Knoxville.
   
 First-year Lady Vols coach Kellie Harper has fond memories of when she played in the rivalry for Tennessee from 1995-99.
   
 "Fans got into this game. There was an intensity about the game. There was high-quality basketball being played, so even people who didn't have a dog in the fight were interested in the game because it was fun to watch," she said. "For us as players, it was fun to play in those games. These were some of our biggest crowds. I think we all enjoyed it. We enjoyed the competition."
   
 She isn't sure if the series will continue after next year.
   
 "I don't (have an opinion) yet. I'm sure at some point I will have an opinion, but I don't yet. I think right now we're in it, we understand it. We're looking at it as an opportunity and kind of see how it goes," she said. "I think part of that, honestly for us, will be the rest of our schedule and how that plays out. Just how we move forward with them and what other stipulations do we have, whether it's two-year, four-year … and television coverage. There's just a lot of things that go into it."
   
 Candace Parker plans to watch the game on TV on Thursday night if her schedule permits. She was a big part of the last meeting in 2007. She had 30 points, 12 rebounds, six blocks and the sixth dunk of her career to lead the Lady Vols 70-64 win.
   
 As great as that game was for her, Parker's favorite memory is she never lost in her two games to the Huskies.
   
 "It's something that I always would mention to Coach Auriemma when he would make comments during USA Basketball practice," she said, laughing. "I'm happy for women's basketball fans. I think it's great. I think it'll be a good rivalry that's restored, and it'll be a lot of fun."
   
 Most of the current players on both teams were in elementary school for the last meeting, but they're aware of the history.
   
 "I'm not sure that it will hold the same emotion that it did when they were playing back then, but we know it's still a big game and not one that we want to give up," said UConn senior and former Blackman High School standout Crystal Dangerfield, who said she loved former UT star Chamique Holdsclaw growing up. "That was a nasty player. But I mean, after a while you see where I am. I turned blue."
   
 The Huskies hinted that they might be wearing throwback jerseys for the game Thursday night.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] is making an earnest bid to steer clear of the row over the police slamming the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on two party workers by distancing itself from the government stance and adhering to the stated position against wantonly invoking its provisions.
 A section of senior leaders, including general secretary Sitaram Yechury, had reiterated that the party had an unflinching stance on imposing UAPA and would not alter it at any cost. The decision to invoke the Act against the two party workers, Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal, on charges of Maoist links and the decision to impose UAPA had put the party in a tight spot.
 For, the youths as well as their families with strong CPI(M) moorings had publicly expressed their confidence in the party and the local leadership had risen up to their expectations too. But the government stance, largely based on the information shared by the police had led to a confusion and it reached a flashpoint with Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader M.K. Muneer calling on the families offering legal assistance if the CPI(M) leadership was found to be wanting.
 Such tactical moves alerted the CPI(M) leadership to swing into action and declare solidarity with the family and extend organisational support to the youths to mend their ways, if they had gone wayward. This intervention of the Kozhikode CPI(M) leadership is expected to give a reprieve to the youths under NIA custody, a much needed moral support for their families and stave off the United Democratic Front (UDF) bid to reap political mileage by placing the onus on the party for the plight of the youths.
 Any decision to religiously implement Central laws such as the UAPA may be misread at a time when the party and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) have taken a vociferous position against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and is spearheading the agitations to protect the rights of minorities.
 This may also give a leeway for the UDF, which is still on the backfoot in organising CAA agitations, and in anticipation, the party has veered round to a position to pursue its own course on UAPA unmindful of the government stance on the issue.

The spotlight on top-performing ESG funds comes at a time when interest in sustainable investing is at a high. A report published last summer from Ethical Markets showed an upward trend in private “green” investments worldwide, and claimed these investments equal a cumulative $10.387 trillion as of 2019. “Although we still have a long way to go,” wrote Tim Nash, one of the report’s authors, in Corporate Knights, “…the green economy is already here and now, to the tune of $10 trillion over the last decade.” In fact, the percentage of individual US investors that are interested in sustainable investing has gone up by 10 percentage points — to 85% — since 2017, and more specialty funds are expected to be launched, according to a recent Morgan Stanley survey.

State Pollution Control Board (PCB) Chairman Ajit Haridas resigned on Wednesday night, days after the board members unanimously passed a no- confidence motion against him and the State government sought an explanation from him based on the board’s recommendations.
 Dr. Haridas had been at loggerheads with the rest of the board members on PCB’s issuance of a show-cause notice to the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation charging an environmental compensation fine of ₹14 crore for its alleged failure in complying with solid waste management rules. The members alleged that this and similar decisions against other local bodies were taken by the Chairman unilaterally.
 The show-cause notice, which came before the Vattiyurkavu Assembly byelection in which the then Mayor V.K. Prasanth was a candidate, had kicked up a political storm with the Opposition making it one of the campaign issues. The Corporation had maintained that the notice was issued without considering all the efforts made in developing a model of waste treatment at source. Mayor K. Sreekumar had alleged that the action was being taken against the Corporation because it rejected a proposal for a waste-to-energy plant submitted by the PCB Chairman, before he took charge.
 ## High Court stay
 Early in December, the Kerala High Court stayed further proceedings on the board’s show-cause notice issued in September against the Corporation. The board members passed the unanimous resolution against him at a special meeting held on December 27.
 Dr. Haridas confirmed that he had conveyed his decision to step down to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He told _The Hindu_ that he was yet to receive a communication that the government had accepted his resignation.
 “There is no provision for the board members to move a no-confidence motion against the Chairman and, as such, the resolution is illegal.” Asked about the show-cause notice issued to the Corporation, he said he had gone strictly by the rules as he was expected to do in his capacity as PCB Chairman.
