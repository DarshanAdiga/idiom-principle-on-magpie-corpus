Telemonitoring platforms and different frameworks are as a rule progressively recognized over the globe for their different capacities, for example, weight records, essential signs check, pulse observing, and appraisal of oxygen immersion. The expanding prominence of home healthcare services setting is functioning in approval of the market. Also, the augmenting base of geriatric populace is giving a huge lift to the development of the market. In any case, the patient record exchange and electronic stockpiling in telemonitoring stages and frameworks can conceivably prompt protection and security ruptures. Incapable administration of these issues can fill in as an open door for trespassers to get to classified information and conceivably change, take, or even erase records of patients. These issues are, therefore, constraining the market from understanding its most extreme potential.

Amman (Jordan), Mar 7 (PTI) Star Indian boxer Amit Panghal (52kg) advanced to the quarterfinals with a hard-earned triumph over Mongolia's Enkhmanadakh Kharkhuu in the Asian Qualifiers to be just one win away from securing an Olympic berth, here on Saturday.
 The 23-year-old top seed, who became India's first silver-medallist at the world championships last year, prevailed in a split 3-2 decision after a fast- paced slugfest in which fortunes swung quite wildly.
 The reigning Asian Games and Asian champion had to dig deep to edge past an aggressive and energetic Kharhuu.
 Panghal was expectedly quick on his feet, displayed a terrific counter- attacking game and his left hand, especially, proved to be effective in the first two rounds.
 However, the Mongolian sustained the pressure in the final three minutes in which Panghal seemed a bit off-colour. But he managed just enough to pull through and fetch a divided verdict.
 In the evening session, London Olympics bronze-medallist M C Mary Kom (51kg) will begin her campaign for a Tokyo Olympics berth by taking on New Zealand's Tasmyn Benny in the second round.
 The second-seeded Indian had received an opening-round bye.

Breaking Bad es considerada una de las series más emblemáticas de los últimos años. Comparte Olimpo con otras producciones que son verdaderos hitos de la narrativa audiovisual como The Sopranos, The Wired, Six Feet Under, entre otras que definieron un rumbo que hoy sigue nutriendo este universo con tramas cada vez más espectaculares. Pero el creador de Breaking Bad le ha ofrecido a los fanáticos de la serie algo que no terminamos de agradecer, la posibilidad de que los relatos no lleguen a un punto final.
 La muerte de Walter White en el capítulo final de la serie no fue un canto de cisne para el mundo fronterizo que Vince Gilligan narró a lo largo de cinco temporadas. Fue una despedida, pero a veces las despedidas son una puerta abierta en las historias y con el estreno de la serie Better Call Saul, en 2015, y el lanzamiento de la película El Camino, en 2019, el escritor demostró que atravesó esa puerta para abrir otras que saltan en el tiempo y redundan sobre las vidas de personajes que merecían existir un poco más.

Margao, Mar 7 (PTI) Churchill Brothers return to their base against Gokulam Kerala here on Sunday, bidding to keep the pressure on the I-League leaders.
 Churchill Brothers are currently placed fourth in the table with 20 points from 14 games.
 They still have six games to play and if all goes well can muster a total of 38 points. Gokulam Kerala are placed seventh with 19 points from 14 games and in order to end up among the top 5, they will have to win at least four of their five encounters.
 Churchill Brothers are coming on the back of a shock defeat at the hands of Trau FC 1-0 which severely dented their prospects of being crowned league champions for the third time.
 Churchill Brothers head coach Bernardo Tavares said, "Yes, the loss against Trau was a little unnerving but I believe we are only to blame for it. We weren't able to create enough goal scoring chances when we should have. Trau was disciplined and pretty hard to breakdown on the night."
 "If we dwell too deep into the equation we will not able to concentrate on the match and I believe we should just have one goal that is to win all the remaining matches and hope that the rest of the events turn out to be in our favour," he added.
 Gokulam Kerala, on the other hand, are coming on the back of a hard-fought 1-1 draw against Quess East Bengal.
 The result though doesn't give a clear picture of the loss that Gokulam Kerala faced. The Malabarians will be missing the services of Haroon Amiri and Naocha Singh who were sent off in the match after receiving two yellow cards respectively.
 Captain Marcus Joseph, who happens to be the highest scorer from the Kerala outfit, said, "It has been a difficult season for us. When the league started we were in tremendous form but some close matches have really cost us. We are missing two of our mainstays in the defence line up in against Churchill and it always unsettles a settled line-up." PTI
