Valley Stream, N.Y. (AP) — A white man and woman accused of harassing a Black woman who lives next door to them, including throwing feces and firing a pellet gun, were arrested and charged Monday, the Nassau County District Attorney's office said. District Attorney Madeline Singas said John McEneaney, 57, and Mindy Canarick, 53, were charged with misdemeanors in connection to the alleged treatment of their neighbor, Jennifer McLeggan, who moved into her home in April 2017. McEneaney was charged with criminal mischief as well as harassment, and faces up to a year in jail. Canarick was charged with criminal tampering and faces up to three months in jail. Both were arraigned and released on their own recognizance, and are due back in court in October. Phone numbers for them were not available, and a call to an attorney for McEneaney was not answered. The judge also handed down an order of protection at the behest of prosecutors. McLeggan, mother to a toddler, had said her neighbors had been subjecting her to repeated abuse since she moved in. She said she had told police, but had gotten no help. She gained public support last month, after posting a sign to her door saying she was being harassed. One of her attorneys, Heather Palmore, said the arrests were only the first step in the process, and said they “were a long time coming.\" She lauded the district attorney's office for investigating and bringing the charges. “Anybody who comes to these communities has a right to live there, and has a right to live free of harassment,\" she said.

Larry Cohen, a prominent Democratic national committeeman, Sanders confidant and labor leader, pointed to Democrats on Capitol Hill as the guide for the party. Democrats won the House majority in 2018 largely on the strength of more moderate nominees running in suburban and exurban swing districts. But several young progressives, including Ocasio-Cortez, won seats, as well, across battlegrounds and safe Democratic districts.

Jill Osborn, the party's executive director, said there were two other candidates. "We prefer not to announce the nominees," Osborn said.


  Osborn confirmed that Jay Allred, who declared his candidacy July 29, was not nominated. Allred is owner and publisher of Triad Golf Today magazine and the head girls’ golf coach at Reagan.


  Schollander was recommended by former Rep. Debra Conrad, who retired from the seat July 31. If appointed to the interim term, he will serve until Jan. 2, when the 2021-22 legislators are sworn in. Republican Jeff Zenger and Democrat Dan Besse, a Winston-Salem city councilman, are battling for the House District 74 seat in the November general election.


  Schollander's main political experience has been serving on the nonpartisan county Soil and Water Conservation District as a supervisor. He was re- appointed by the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners in December 2018, where he serves as vice chairman.


  He has served as head general counsel for the county GOP Party the past 10 years, as well as on multiple party committees.


  Schollander, a graduate of Wake Forest School of Law, focuses his practice in the areas of bankruptcy, family law, criminal law and traffic court.


  Conrad called Schollander "an exemplary public servant and one who will work efficiently and effectively."

Some might say Superman, but I disagree. On paper, it would seem like the logical choice. Firstly, they're both on the same power level, especially in terms of strength and durability. Physically, they're both unstoppable powerhouses with near invulnerability. Wonder Woman can't be weakened by a green rock, but she can be hurt by other things. They both have a strong sense of justice and honor, so their personalities are a match. Sure, Wonder Woman may not be so strong about the whole "no killing" rule, but she shares Supes' ideas on heroism. On top of that, they're both basically the mother and father of DC Comics. It started with them, so why not make them a couple?

"The learning bags will have the tools they need to get started," Hoover said. "They will include small dry eraser boards and counters (to teach math skills) — things you would normally have in the classroom."


  Henson said the bags also have letter and number cards, to which teachers will refer when teaching.


  Hoover said students still get a box of 50 new Scholastic library books.


  "This is the third year we've been able to do that," she said. "They get very excited with their box of books. Most of the students want to open them right away.


  "It's also a great way to get them to start reading, and I'm very passionate about that," she said.


  Hoover, who has taught 14 years in Washington County Public Schools, will be starting her fourth year at Emma K. Doub.


  She currently has 11 students enrolled in her prekindergarten class.


  "Enrollment is still open," Hoover said. "We can take up to 20 students at Emma. We have two pre-K classes."


  Henson said school officials continue taking applications for all pre-K classes in the county. "We'll continue until we're full," she said.


  Meanwhile, Hoover said she will strive to keep her students engaged from her Disney-themed classroom, even as WCPS stipulates that instructors teach virtually from school.


  "My plan is to teach, sing songs and play games," she said. "I plan to do all the things we normally do."


  Her goal for teaching the youngest of WCPS students remains the same.


  "My goal as a pre-K teacher is to get (students) to love school and love learning," she said. "The goal doesn't change. All we want is the best for the kids. I'm excited to meet my pre-K friends."

  # STRINGER: Dandy Dozen, football previews to return


  Seth Stringer


  Northwest Florida Daily News


  Well, to borrow from the infinite wisdom of journalist Ron Burgundy, “that escalated quickly.”


  The fall season received a Hail Mary – and an around-the-corner start date – on Friday with FHSAA’s 11-5 vote to begin fall practice on Aug. 24. That followed a more-than five-month sabbatical from prep sports due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which canceled the spring state series earlier this year.


  But the fall season somehow plows on, something 16 other states vehemently disagree on with their postponement until spring time. You can argue the science and safety all day, but football – along with cross country, swimming and golf – will be played in the crazy mess that is 2020.


  So Sam Grubenhoff, we better get busy.


  With the first official practice set for next week, we’re less than a month away from Friday Night Lights – albeit a very different version based on to- be-determined safety protocols.


  For readers this means you’re about to get a deluge of gridiron content.


  We’ll bring back The Panhandle renowned Dandy Dozen.


  We’ll preview all 10 area teams leading up to the season – R.I.P. 2020 Football Tab.


  We’ll provide predictions and best-case and worst-case scenarios for every team, all accompanied by photo galleries from Santa Rosa, Okaloosa and Walton county practices.


  And soon full schedules will be released – Sept. 11 a more realistic start date over Sept. 4 with teams needing to get acclimated.


  Stay tuned, y’all. Football – knock on wood – is back. And so is our commitment to covering it all.

Friday afternoon's announcement that high school football would be postponed until the spring brought new difficulties for area football coaches.


   


  Ionia coach Chad Rhynard saw his first season as head coach postponed for another six months, but his present challenge was trying to find something to say to his players Friday.


   


  "I'm pretty heartbroken for our kids. We had a great first week, we had an extremely demanding first week, and my heart just breaks for them," he said. "I don't make any of these decisions. Not knowing what to tell them. I was dreading this conversation with them.


   


  "I'd love to reassure them we're going to play in the spring, but I just don't know, and that's the part that's really hard."


   


  Practice without pads had begun on Monday, Aug. 10, but some teams only got four days in with five maximum before the MHSAA sent out the announcement that football would be moved to the spring. An announcement on the 2020 season was scheduled to be made by next week at the latest.


   


  Lakewood coach Matt Markwart echoed Rhynard's emotions on how it affects his players, but also understands that the announcement helps overcome all the uncertainty that plagued the first week of practice and the murky future ahead.


   


  "With everything going on, it's not a surprise that this was the decision was made. It's still not a fun conversation to have," Markwart said. "There is a relief when it comes to that. There were rumors flying everywhere. All those things you look at, how do you get your players to come out."


   


  Pewamo-Westphalia coach Jeremy Miller was also very sad for his Pirates, who were gearing up for a state title defense after a dream season in 2019.


   


  But stepping back from how it affects his Pirates, he also acknowledged that he's going to miss being their coach for another few months.


   


  "I just enjoyed the heck out of these kids this week. You kind of forget about all the craziness going on in the world," Miller said. "Selfishly, that's what I'm going to miss the most this fall, not seeing them."


   


  How football will work in the spring is anyone's guess. The state of Illinois carved out a football season beginning on Feb. 15 and ending May 1, but also moved other sports around to make that happen and avoid overlap.


   


  That was part of the uncertainty that made Rhynard sad Friday. He knows the powers that be will work it out, but not knowing the path forward made it uncertain.


   


  "I don't see how we could play a full season," Rhynard said. "Maybe we play four games and everyone makes the playoffs for a fifth."


   


  Football could overlap with spring sports like baseball and track or be affected on the front end by the end of the winter sports season with basketball. The MHSAA said they would work to limit overlap between sports.


   


  More schedules could be affected than just those on the gridiron.


   


  "With the extraordinary circumstances, sports are going to have to think outside the box," Miller said. "I'm very confident we'll be able to work past that .. and get a good experience in both sports."


   


  Miller also cited the turnaround between a spring 2021 season and a fall 2021 season, how to deal with spring break in the middle of the season, and field conditions from the winter as potential issues.


   


  So the famed Friday night lights won't turn on in 2020.


   


  And whatever that means going forward, Markwart will be ready to get on the sidelines with the Vikings when the time comes.


   


  "We know we're going to play in March now. In that respect, we know we're going to have games," he said. "This is the first time in 37 years I've not played or coached football in the fall. We're going to be the Lakewood team to play football in March."

HOPKINTON — Beneath the trees of Camp Yawgoog this weekend, three original members of West Warwick’s newest Cub Scout unit took their first steps into Scouts BSA.


  Founded in the spring by a group of local families, Pack 1913 should have held its first Crossover and Arrow of Light Ceremony in the spring. Because of coronavirus, however, the event had to be delayed.


  “This has been a unique year for us,” Chris Black, committee chair of Pack 1913, said as he led the belated ceremony.


  Establishing a new Cub Scout pack as a pandemic took hold certainly posed some challenge. But, despite the difficult circumstances, the unit’s members have striven to adapt.


  In addition to holding regular virtual den meetings and taking part in hands- on activities posted to their YouTube channel, members of Pack 1913 have participated over the last few months in several service projects around the Pawtuxet Valley.


  “This is like a big family,” Lisa Fratus, the pack’s new cubmaster, said before the ceremony Saturday morning.


  And as a family, it was important that the second-year Webelos, each a rising sixth-grader, be given a proper crossover into Troop 11 Coventry.


  “They never had a ceremony, so I felt like they kind of got forgotten,” said Fratus, whose twin sons Travis and Logan are first-year Webelos in Pack 1913. “It’s just nice to be able to give this to them.”


  In addition to receiving citations from the Town of West Warwick, state Sen. Adam Satchell and the BSA Narragansett Council, Anthony Capaldi, Caden LaPointe and Wyatt Rainey each also were recognized Saturday for achieving the highest rank in Cub Scouts.


  The Arrow of Light, Black explained as he prepared to hand Capaldi, LaPointe and Rainey each an “arrow of honor” to mark the milestone, symbolizes their accomplishments as Cub Scout graduates.


  “Our second-year Webelos, Arrow of Light Scouts, have brought great honor to this pack as they have climbed the Scouting trail,” Black said. “After earning the Arrow of Light, everyone knows that a Cub Scout is ready to become a Boy Scout.”


  The three boys stood beside Black, as their parents attached Arrow of Light patches, one of the only Cub Scout patches that can be worn on a Scouts BSA uniform, to their khaki shirts.


  After receiving their awards, John Potvin, scoutmaster of Troop 11 Coventry, led the young Scouts to the other side of a handmade wooden bridge. And as they crossed, Jacob Phillips, the incoming senior patrol leader for Troop 11 and a rising junior at Bishop Hendricken, and Owen Dowling, the troop’s outgoing senior patrol leader and a rising senior at the Greene School, attached new epaulets to each Scout’s shoulder.


  And then, as Potvin brought the Scouts BSA handbook down onto each boy’s shoulders, the three officially became part of Troop 11.


  The other Cub Scouts of Pack 1913 were recognized Saturday, as well, as they ranked up within the unit.


  One at a time, the young Scouts mounted the bridge, atop which had been written all six Cub Scout ranks. Each stood on the portion representing his current rank, while the who had earned their Arrow of Light patches helped replace his sash and neckerchief.


  Black gave each Pack 1913 member a founders patch Saturday, as well, before also taking a moment to thank Frank Capaldi for his hand in bringing the vision for the pack to fruition.


  “When we brought the idea together, that it was time to create a new unit, although Frank knew his time was certainly limited in Cub Scouts, he was full on board,” Black said of the outgoing cubmaster, who will still have an assistant role in the unit but plans to follow his son this fall into Scouts BSA.


  A caricature of Frank Capaldi was stuck to the backside of the bridge — the plan is to make a fun tradition of adding each scoutmaster to the lineup.


  Fratus was also recognized during the ceremony. As she enters her new role as cubmaster of Pack 1913, she said she looks forward to creating more service opportunities for the members of her unit. She also plans to focus on fundraising, which she said has been difficult amid the pandemic.


  “We’re trying to cover the kids’ costs,” Fratus said. “We don’t want kids not to do Scouting because of the cost — we want them to be able to Scout.”


  Another major goal, Fratus added, is for the pack to continue giving back to the town.


  Named in part for the year West Warwick was incorporated, Pack 1913 and its members take pride in their hometown. Fratus said that she’d like to collaborate with some of the local nonprofits on projects that will benefit the town’s residents, for example. She added that she plans to work with Wreaths Across America to lay wreaths in local veterans cemeteries, like the one at the Gen. Nathanael Greene Homestead.


  “We’re trying to teach the kids that you should be giving back,” she said.


  As Scouts and their families mingled before Saturday's ceremony, Potvin said he’s happy to welcome the new Scouts into Troop 11.


  “It’s my honor to welcome these Scouts into their next adventure, the next chapter of their Scouting career,” he said.


  Phillips added that he looks forward to guiding the new Scouts.


  “I’m excited to lead them,” Phillips said. “I just hope I don’t mess it up.”


  As for the new Scouts, themselves, their excitement Saturday was mixed with some nervousness about being the new guys in the troop.


  “I’m kind of nervous,” LaPointe admitted, standing among his fellow Scouts following the ceremony. “I know I’m going to be new to it all.”


  Capaldi shared those feelings.


  “I’m worried,” he said, an Arrow of Light patch attached to his shirt pocket, “but I’m not that worried.”


  After all, they’ll always be part of the Pack 1913 family.


  “Even though they’re crossing over, they won’t technically be part of our [unit], but they’re not going anywhere,” Fratus said. “We’re a family.”


  Those interested in keeping up with Pack 1913 can follow its Facebook page or visit its website at pack1913.org.

  While the appeals court ruled the state commission has final authority, the ruling also stated local government is a "significant participant in the process" and the state commission should give "due consideration" to local zoning laws in rendering its decision.

Now, Williams said, he waits for a mismatch to develop, attacks that, or waits for James to make a move where the Lakers can get an advantage.

Suresh Raina communicated his retirement decision to the BCCI a day after he made it public, the Board said on Monday, lauding the former India all-rounder for being a key player in the limited-overs format. Minutes after the iconic Mahendra Singh Dhoni announced his international retirement on August 15, 33-year-old Raina followed his mentor in doing the same, surprising many.
 "Attacking left-hand batsman Suresh Raina officially communicated to BCCI on Sunday about his decision to retire from international cricket," said the BCCI in a statement. The usual norm is players informing the BCCI before announcing retirement.
 Raina represented India in 18 Tests, 226 ODIs and 78 T20Is in an international career spanning 13 years. He also had the honour of captaining the team briefly. "Under his captaincy, India registered a 3-2 series victory in West Indies and a 2-0 win over Bangladesh in ODIs and a 2-0 T20 International series win in Zimbabwe," the statement added.
 Raina, who scored a century on debut in Tests, is also the first Indian to slam hundreds in all three formats of the game and his centuries were scored outside India. BCCI president Sourav Ganguly paid a glowing tribute to a fellow southpaw.
 "Suresh Raina has been one of the key performers in limited overs cricket for India. Coming lower down the order and playing some of the match-winning knocks requires a lot of skill and talent," Ganguly stated. "He along with Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni formed a solid middle order for India in ODIs. I wish him and his family all the very best," he added.
 BCCI secretary Jay Shah echoed the sentiment. "Suresh Raina has been arguably one of the finest T20 batsmen. A live wire on the field, Raina's prowess as a left-handed batsman was exhibited throughout his cricketing career.
 "A big match player, Raina's cameo against Australia in the quarterfinal in the 2011 World Cup was a testimony to his glittering career that followed. I wish him all the very best in the second innings of his career," said Shah. PTI BS PM

Because the alternate site has a maximum of 30 players, some games wind up with staffers playing positions. There are not enough arms to stage daily nine-inning games, either. MLB is exploring adding up to 15 players to each alternate site, which should help with that issue. But in weighing a top prospect's development, there's an argument to be made that even if it starts his service clock (as it would with Kelenic), having him spend time in the major leagues is more advantageous to a team's future than a potentially wasted year of development at an alternate site.

HOPKINTON — The application for amendments to the town’s zoning and comprehensive plan for a commercial solar energy project at 201 Chase Hill Road continued last week at a virtual public hearing.


  Filed by Centrica Business Solutions and Karen and James Cherenzia Jr., the proposal for the 23-acre property was first presented to the Planning Board nearly a year and a half ago on March 6, 2019. Citing the commercial solar project’s incompatibility with the town’s comprehensive plan, members of the board issued a unanimous negative advisory opinion on the project, which would place a large commercial solar facility in a residential zone.


  At last week’s two-hour hearing, the council heard from several witnesses for the developer as well as members of the public.


  Representing the applicants, attorney Steven Surdut introduced three witnesses, beginning with project engineer Jason Gold, who told the council that after hearing the concerns of abutters, the project had been reduced in both size and visual impact.


  “We made quite a bit of changes to reduce the size of this array and to push it further back into the northeast corner,” he said. “The array’s been reduced from 3.3 megawatts to 2.5 megawatts. That’s a 24% reduction. This reduced the size of the fenced area by 4.4 acres about, down to 8.7 acres, so that’s 34%, nearly a third reduction in area.”


  Moving the project back from neighboring residences, Gold said, increased the distance to the nearest abutter by 200 feet to 480 feet.


  The unconventional plans for the project call for retaining the house on the property, while the rest of the parcel would be changed from a low-density residential zone to commercial.


  In addition, the new facility would not be able to connect to the adjacent National Grid Chase Hill substation and would require the installation of poles down to Chase Hill Road.


  Centrica Director of Business Development Douglas Telepman said he was aware that solar development was a controversial topic in town but he emphasized that his company stood apart from other solar developers that have built unpopular projects in the town.


  “This project should not be thought of and lumped in with some of these other projects that have been at the root of quite a bit of controversy,” he said.


  Telepman also noted that the Cherenzias had approached his company because they need the revenue.


  “I don’t believe that this is really a commercial situation as it relates to your contemplating this approval,” he told the council. “I think this is very personal and it’s very personal to the extent that if you choose to approve this system, or the application, the impact is going to be life-changing for the Cherenzia family, and if you choose not to approve the application, it will also be life-changing for the Cherenzia family, but in a negative way.”


  In addition to the $11,250 it would collect in annual personal property taxes, Telepman said the town would benefit financially from electricity from the project.


  “The town can benefit over the next 20 years to the tune of about $4.5 million, and if the town wanted to use the power for longer, the financial benefit over 25 years would approach $6 million,” he said.


  Council member Sylvia Thompson said she appreciated the work that Centrica had done on other projects in the town and the company’s willingness to listen to abutters’ concerns, but she said she remained opposed to the project.


  “The last hearing I attended, I had a negative view then, and I still, unfortunately, have a negative view of the project as it stands now,” she said. “It’s a very difficult area for solar, because in a sense it’s landlocked, and the only access road is onto Chase Hill, and we all know how dangerous that road can be.”


  During the public comment period, residents were unanimous in their opposition to the project.


  “It doesn’t matter how many times the applicant reduces the footprint of the panels or rearranges them on the parcel,” Clifford Heil said. “... Changing a single residential parcel in a rural residential neighborhood to a commercial parcel is not going to be consistent with the comprehensive plan.”


  Joshua Cherenzia, son of the property owners, said he did not understand why opposition to the proposal had become so intense.


  “They’re just looking to make some money,” he said. “My father’s in a hardship, my mother’s really in a hardship now with the virus and everything that’s going on at the school. Like I said, I understand it’s nobody’s fault. I just wish everybody wouldn’t get so angry. I’ve never seen so much hate.”


  The council will render a decision on the project at the Sept. 21 meeting.

The La Jolla Shores Association discussed its feelings about making some of the neighborhood’s streets one way for vehicle traffic, and the general consensus was of opposition at the group’s Aug. 12 meeting.


  LJSA President Janie Emerson said a Shores resident had emailed the board with an idea to convert a few streets in The Shores to one way “because of the congestion between La Jolla Shores Drive and the ocean.”


  Emerson said the topic would be on the Aug. 19 agenda for the La Jolla Traffic & Transportation Board, “but I thought [we should] talk about it.”


  LJSA board member Andi Andreae said “the advantage of having two-way traffic is that it slows down traffic. If you make it one way, people are going to be barreling down the roads at high speeds. I think slowing down the traffic is a good thing.”


  Board member Dede Donovan responded, “I thought one-way streets were a good idea, but I just changed my mind.”


  Board member John Shannon said one-way streets “are the logical evolution when we have autonomous vehicles on the road. It’s going to happen.”


  Andreae said it will “be awhile” until autonomous vehicles are widely used.


  Though no formal vote was taken, board members agreed that for now, they would oppose one-way streets as suggested.


  “I don’t think people are ready for it yet,” Shannon said. “It doesn’t necessarily make things safer.”


  Board member Ross Rudolph, who represents LJSA to the Traffic & Transportation Board, said he would share the LJSA discussion with T&T Chairman Dave Abrams and “see what evolves from the [T&T] meeting.”


  Emerson said “we’ll see what comes out of the T&T discussion, at which point we can actually do a formal motion.”

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — WNBA All-Star center Liz Cambage is set to return to the Australian women’s basketball league after signing with the Southside Flyers. Cambage is missing the WNBA season for the Las Vegas Aces after being medically excused by the league’s independent panel of doctors, who deemed her to be at high risk for getting severe illness if she contracted COVID-19. Basketball Australia announced Cambage's signing on Tuesday for the season which is scheduled to start in November. “While the coronavirus interrupted my WNBA career, it has given me the opportunity to play in Australia,” Cambage said in a statement. “I have always enjoyed playing in the WNBL, it is one of the best competitions in the world and I hope to see more supporters get behind the Flyers this season.” The 28-year- old Cambage hasn't played in the Australian league since the 2017-18 season. She began her career with the Dandenong Rangers, now known as the Southside Flyers. Australian Opals captain Jenna O'Hea and assistant coach Cheryl Chambers are part of the Flyers franchise. “It will be great playing with a number of Opals teammates ... Jenna O’Hea is one of my favorites ... she is like my captain on and off the court,” Cambage said. Cambage averaged 15.9 points and 8.2 rebounds last season for the Aces, her first with the team. She has played four years in the WNBA after getting drafted second in 2011 by the Tulsa Shock. Cambage, who was traded from Dallas to Las Vegas before last season and re-signed with the Aces in April, was medically excused from the league in July. Australia has closed its international borders since March and restrictions are in place for domestic and international travelers. ___ More...

Even without the impending election, everybody's already stressed to the max. Is this really the best time to slow mail delivery? You couldn't wait three more months?


  Of course, being an experienced and successful businessman, you’re concerned about the Postal Service’s bleeding bottom line. That’s appropriate.


  But this is a different world. The Postal Service isn’t a business — it’s a constitutionally mandated service. The U.S. military has never made a profit, either, but it does what it’s supposed to do.


  On top of that, sir, we’re worried about your future. The president recently indicated that he might support a stand-alone bill to provide funds to the post office — which might leave you looking like the bad guy.


  We know the president only hires the best people, but somehow, a lot of these best people become “losers,” “dumb as a rock,” “lazy,” “weak” and “incompetent” after working in the Trump administration. Or so he says. Many of them leave the president’s service with damaged reputations. They include Jeff Sessions, Anthony Scaramucci, Sean Spicer, Kirstjen Nielsen, Michael Flynn, John Bolton, Don McGahn, Rex Tillerson, James Mattis, John Kelly ... we've only got so much room. Former Republican campaign operative Rick Wilson wrote a book about such people; it's called "Everything Trump Touches Dies."


  We realize that some are calling for your resignation, and to be honest, we think you should consider it. But not yet. First, you should repair the damage you’ve caused. You should restore the services being provided by hard-working, hard-walking delivery personnel across the country.


  You could begin to do so today. Then, when you meet representatives of the House on Aug. 24, you’ll have something positive to say.


  The American people will thank you. They may even send you a letter.

I wish I could tell you that in my 24 years of working with seniors, I never saw financial exploitation. Unfortunately, I have witnessed theft of property, investments, money, jewelry and more.


   


  Most of these crimes are perpetrated by someone the older person knows and trusts like family, neighbors and caregivers. One in five people over the age of 65 have been the victim of financial fraud and it is estimated that senior financial abuse is now over $36.5 billion last year alone!


   


  So what is Florida doing about it? On July 1, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a new bill (statute 517.34) that is designed to protect vulnerable senior investors from financial exploitation. The new "Vulnerable Investor" statute permits an entirely new group of professionals to not only take action and report suspected financial abuse of a senior, but provides the ability for them to "freeze" a transaction.


   


  This group includes investment advisers and security dealers who, up to now, had no recourse if they suspected abuse of an elderly client. Privacy issues, laws and liability issues prevented them from acting in the past, even if they suspected exploitation was happening. Now they are mandated to report suspected abuse but will be immune from civil liability if acting in good faith.


   


  If an investment adviser "reasonably believes that financial exploitation has occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted in connection with a disbursement or transaction," this adviser can now, with this new law, delay or "freeze," any transaction for up to 15 business days after the date they received a request. The new law also allows them to notify a "trusted contact" of the problematic transaction-- i.e., sending money to a scammer overseas.


   


  The person initiating the delay is then required within three days to notify in writing "all persons authorized to transact business on the account and any trusted contacts on the account," unless the person to be contacted is the person engaged in the suspected exploitation. They must then notify the Florida Office of Financial Regulation of the delay and all related records must be made available.


   


  Before you cry foul, understand that this statute clearly defines who this applies to. Called "Protection of Specified Adults," the definition of a vulnerable adult was expanded and defined as 65 or older, with an impaired ability to perform activities of daily living or to provide for his or her own care or protection due to a "mental, emotional, sensory long-term physical or developmental disability or dysfunction, or brain damage or the infirmities of aging."


   


  I do wish they had come up with a phrase more politically correct than "infirmities of aging," but let's not get picky. According to Alex J. Sabo, a South Florida attorney specializing in vulnerable seniors who was very involved in the writing and passage of this bill, "the new legislation contains a strong statement of legislative intent, recognizing the freedom of individuals covered by the statute to manage assets, make investment decisions, and spend their funds as they see fit, but at the same time providing for their protection."


   


  To put this bill in context, Florida passed a groundbreaking bill in 2014 that establishing a much broader definition of exploitation against seniors that included persons "in a position of trust and confidence with the elderly person." It allowed (finally) for both criminal and civil charges to be brought against people who steal from joint accounts or who use their status as an agent under power of attorney to pay their own bills or make gifts to themselves.


   


  In July 2018, Florida passed another statute that allowed for immediate injunctions and if warranted, investigations of those exploiting vulnerable adults, another effective tool to foil perpetrators.


   


  With this new bill, financial advisers can now take actions to prevent someone with cognitive impairment, for example, from being taken advantage of. No longer do they need to watch their clients lose everything to a scammer or exploiter and be powerless to stop it.


   


  Kudos to the Florida Securities Dealers Association, Financial Services Institute, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIMFA), and Gainesville's own North Central Florida Senior Advocacy Network, of which I am a member. All of these groups worked with the Florida Office of Financial Regulations and the Elder Section of The Florida Bar.


   


  Finally, good news in these troubled times. This proves that diverse political groups and organizations can come together and pass legislation for the real benefit of our elders. Our Florida seniors will be safer for it!

Tillsonburg Minor Soccer Club has responded to a delegation from Tillsonburg FC to Tillsonburg town council on Aug. 10 with a formal letter that they have submitted to council.


  "We are disappointed that an internal matter has become so public, and as we have become increasingly aware of the many falsehoods and misinformation that have been presented as fact in this case, we feel it necessary to clear up misconceptions and statements that have been made regarding the current situation," stated the board of directors in the letter.


  It was noted that all soccer programs provided by TMSC are sanctioned and insured through the Western Counties Soccer Association, an organization dedicated to the promotion and support of grassroots soccer.


  "TMSC is committed to providing fun, affordable, inclusive, and community- focused soccer for everyone," stated a Tillsonburg Minor Soccer Club board member on Facebook, responding to a story on the Tillsonburg FC delegation at Tillsonburg Council on Aug. 10. "For us, that includes house league and competitive, working together for a common goal, not in opposition of each other."


  At the August 10 meeting, Council voted to support the formation of a liaison group consisting of two members from each soccer club, with resource support from two Town representatives.


  "It's a great idea," said Chris Kelly, president of Tillsonburg Minor Soccer Club. "There is room for both clubs. We have two very different purposes and we should both be helping each other out. But for whatever reason, it's not working out that way right now and it's something that needs to be fixed, absolutely."


  That same sentiment was shared in TMSC's letter to council.


  "We look forward to working together with (Tillsonburg) FC to form an amicable relationship that brings house league and competitive soccer closer together, serving our community to provide inclusive, developmentally appropriate, and affordable soccer for everyone."


  It was noted in the letter that because of the lack of funds due to all recreational and competitive leagues cancelling their seasons, TMSC had closed the fields for organized soccer to save costs required to maintain fields in game shape.


  "COVID hit in March and shut absolutely everything down," said Kelly. "Because the land is owned by the municipality, we absolutely have to follow the town's instructions as far as closing things down, so everybody was notified March 28th that the club was closed because of COVID-19, and we'd keep everybody in the loop as to what was going to happen from there.


  "They had plans to hopefully start in July. There were several things that we needed in order for that to move forward, like proof of insurance, so that we're not liable for anything. We needed to know how many teams there were going to be, just so that we could schedule fields and make sure that everything was lined up for them."


  That's when the situation deteriorated.


  In the letter, TMSC stated they encouraged Tillsonburg FC to use Gyulveszi Park for practices, with games to be played at the soccer park, stated the board in the letter, and the proposal was denied by Tillsonburg FC.


  "If Tillsonburg FC wishes to use the fields," stated the TMSC board of directors, "with nets, lines, hydro, and washroom facilities, it is more than reasonable to expect that they will in some way, pay for use and contribute to the legacy of the facility."

BELOIT, Wis. — Marjorie was born into a tumultuous world and made it better and brighter every day of her life.


  On Feb. 10, 1922, not long after the Spanish flu epidemic subsided, Charles Siegwart and Violet Dietze Siegwart of Chicago gave birth to Marge. Along with her younger brother, Jerry, the Siegwart family toughed out the Great Depression in Chicago’s Edison Park neighborhood, where 16-year-old Marge eventually met her husband-to-be, Claude “Wink” Winkelhake, 18, skating at a local park.


  A woman ahead of her time, Marge worked outside of the home, enrolling in secretarial school and taking jobs with CH Adams & Co. and the Pennsylvania Railroad while Wink served in the Army Air Corps stateside during World War II. The couple married on May 11, 1944, and moved around the country so Wink could pursue his Ph.D.

CANNON BEACH, Ore. (AP) — One of the most popular park sites on the north Oregon coast is back open to the public. Ecola State Park north of Cannon Beach opened Saturday, after wrapping up long-awaited road repairs caused by a landslide last winter, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The main entrance on the south end of the park closed in February after a nearly 100-foot (30-meter) section of the Crescent Beach Trail slid over a cliff, damaged the entrance road and disconnected the park’s main waterline. Plans to repair the road were put on hold as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the region and shut down the Oregon state parks system in March. While neighboring state park sites on the north Oregon coast started to reopen in June, all of Ecola remained closed until the parks department could complete the repairs. Sections of the park remain closed, including the segment of the Crescent Beach Trail that was lost in the landslide, and part of the Indian Beach Trail that washed out in 2017. The reopening of Ecola comes as outdoor recreation areas in Oregon are busier than ever, at least in part due to people flocking to outdoor destinations amid the pandemic. Ecola State Park is expected to become crowded, especially on warm weekends and weekday afternoons. State park officials are urging visitors to show up with a Plan B in mind.

  While the Bucks come into the postseason holding the No. 1 overall seed, the Magic limped into the eighth and final spot in the East, winning just three of eight seeding-round games to finish with a 33-40 record.


  A lack of healthy bodies was partially responsible for their poor showing in the bubble and the Magic will likely still be shorthanded when the series gets underway, but coach Steve Clifford’s team still has plenty of weapons at his disposal to keep the Bucks from mailing it in.

Dorchester School District Two athletic teams have resumed group training.


  In mid-March, COVID-19 shutdown high school sports in South Carolina. In mid- June, local teams began having group training and conditioning once again under strict safety guidelines. However, only 16 days after teams resumed those activities, administrators and athletic directors cancelled all athletic activities for Ashley Ridge, Fort Dorchester and Summerville high schools “in an abundance of caution for the health and safety of students and staff.”


  To the delight of students and coaches a like, teams at those schools are now back to work. The district’s swimming, girls’ golf and girls’ tennis teams were allowed to open practice Aug. 17.


  “Our swimmers were ready and itching to get back in the water,” Ashley Ridge Swim coach Victoria Merritt said. “They want to see their teammates and be a part of something. In the spring they couldn’t see their friends every day and then the excitement of summer league was taken away. A lot of the things they had to look forward to were cancelled so now that there is a chance for a high school season they are very ready for it.”


  Cross country and volleyball teams are being allowed to open their practices Aug. 24 while football and cheer teams will open practice Sept. 8. However, football and cheer teams will be allowed to have group conditioning starting Aug. 24.


  The South Carolina High School League has pushed back opening day of the football season to Sept. 25 and the beginning of the football playoffs to Nov. 13. Swimming, girls’ golf and girls’ tennis teams in the league are now allowed to open their season Aug. 31. Cross country and volleyball teams are now allowed to open their season Sept. 7. Competitive Cheer teams are now allowed to open their season Sept. 13.


  So far, coaches haven’t indicated that COVID-19 has caused the number of athletes interested in participating in fall sports to drop.


  “Most of the kids who can return are back and we have a lot of new kids,” Merritt said of her program. “Students have been home for the last six months so now they are ready to do something.”


  Team activities and competitions will be handled differently this summer and fall as officials try to ensure everyone remains safe. However, officials are planning to work just as hard to ensure athletes continue to reap the benefits of organized sports.


  “We want to build team spirit from the beginning and get them to buy into that team mentality so things won’t be that different,” Merritt said. “We will encourage them to wear that mask and be proactive and smart because at the end of the day it is about keeping yourself and your teammate safe. If they want a season then they have to be safe and wear that mask right up until they get into the pool and the moment they get out put it back on.”


  Schools that belong to the South Carolina Independent Schools Association opened practice for their fall sports teams Aug. 3. Some of those teams have already opened their season. However, SCISA football teams won’t have their first games until Aug. 28.
