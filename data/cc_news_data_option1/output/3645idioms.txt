After picking off MacVittie on the game's opening series, the Chanticleers ran nine out of 10 times in barreling 62 yards for their first touchdown. Kansas fumbled the ball right back two plays later, and McCall threw a touchdown pass to defensive tackle C.J. Brewer in a call that even fooled their own radio announcers.

A: The trial, before a panel of three judges, is expected to take about a year. There is no jury. Juries are selected only for extremely serious cases in Japan, such as murder. In principle, there are no plea bargains although backroom deals are made all the time. Closed pre-trial sessions are held ahead of the trial's opening, often for months before the real trial begins. Japan's legal system has come under fire from both within and outside the country as "hostage justice" because suspects often are held for months and interrogated without a lawyer present, often leading to false confessions, according to critics.

Despite Liverpool boasting one of the best defensive records in the Premier League last season, the first half showed very few signs of that and Bielsa deserves credit for creating an environment that favoured his side.
 Liverpool’s superiority at individual level was shown with a great strike from Salah for his second goal but Leeds themselves created good chances. When Kalvin Phillips was afforded time on the ball, his long-range passing opened up the Reds defence with Harrison and Patrick Bamford finding the back of the net.
 As per Expected Goals provider InfoGol, Leeds created an xG value of 0.11 in the first half compared to Liverpool’s 1.61 which was somewhat inflated by Salah’s early penalty. Nevertheless, that went some way to showing how Leeds had been frantic yet clinical in the opening 45 minutes.
 Into the second half, there was a slight dip in intensity but many of the same principles carried out in the first 45 minutes were on show again. Until the hour mark, that resulted in several opportunities for Liverpool to capitalise on when regaining possession in Leeds’ defensive third.
 However, Firmino - often carrying the ball forwards - failed to make the right decision in order to generate a goal-scoring opportunity. Leeds’ willingness to get players forward into the Reds’ final third subsequently allowed Bielsa’s side a chance to draw level through Klich.

Ambrose admired Lara's work ethic, saying, "Brian Lara worked as hard as anyone to perfect his craft. I played with Brian for many years and there are times when he is batting and he is not feeling comfortable, his timing is a bit off, feet aren't moving - and he (will) come off for the lunch session and go straight into the nets and have us guys bowl to him…a lot of people don't know that, they only see the end result."

_JR:_ My prediction for your site before was the most optimistic. I want to believe the Cardinals will take advantage of the fact the 49ers won't have receivers to throw to. I want to believe that they will struggle to handle Kyler Murray. It is the perfect opportunity to steal a division road game against the favorite.That said, if I am trying to be reasonable, I see this coming down to the wire, ending in a 28-27 or 30-28 game, going either way but probably ending the Niners' favor.

Pascal Struijk and Robin Koch started as the central defensive partnership in their first ever game together. Meanwhile, a total of eight Premier League debutants for the Whites showed just how big a task they had to get something from one of the best sides in Europe right now.
 Nevertheless, right from the word go we saw that Bielsa will not change his principles against teams with superior personnel across the pitch. That may catch Leeds out at times when facing top opposition but it will also lead to highly entertaining matches - as shown on Saturday evening.
 Right from the first few minutes, both sides showed no signs of letting up on their intense pressing systems. Leeds came right out of the blocks with Pablo Hernandez and Mateusz Klich applying pressure in Liverpool’s defensive third.
 Early goals from Mohamed Salah and Jack Harrison within the opening 12 minutes highlighted the attacking nature of both sides, yet not in a conventional free-for-all type of approach. A clear strategy of Leeds’ pressing system had been to man-mark individual players much like they have done previously under Bielsa. Throughout the first half, that unique approach created chaos in the middle of the park with little control from either side which subsequently left the game on a knife-edge.
