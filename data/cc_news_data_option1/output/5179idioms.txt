We come back to tried and true in Scott Pendlebury and Steele Sidebottom. They have been elite players of the competition for a long period now and the Pies missed Sidebottom late in the season due to the birth of his baby, but also in the early stages of the year after an indiscretion in the COVID-19 shutdown. Collingwood's mids were good this year, none better than Taylor Adams. He had his best year. He was hard and tough, he's a no-frills midfielder who just loves the contest. Brodie Grundy didn't have the year he had in previous years but was more than serviceable. Knowing the way he goes about his footy, he will bounce back in 2021 which will bode very well for Collingwood's midfield group. Once again they proved are a very strong contested midfield who strike a good balance on the inside and outside. Their post-clearance contested possession differential is the second-best in the competition, they get after the footy really well. One aspect they can improve on is their ball use going into their forward 50. If they can tidy up their mids to forwards connection the team will score more often.

The Stafford Christmas Parade will be held Saturday at the Stafford County Agricultural Fairgrounds, located at 9000 Celebrate Virginia Parkway. The event begins at 3 p.m., and will be held rain or shine, said parade organizer Gordon Shelton.
 Due to the recent uptick in COVID-19 cases in the region, Shelton said paradegoers should arrive early and park in a good location along the nearly milelong route to view the parade safely from their own vehicles.
 Shelton said Saturday marks the parade’s sixth year. In previous years, the parade was held along Courthouse Road near Brooke Point High School and the Stafford Hospital, at Embrey Mills, and at the Stafford Regional Airport. Gordon said the location this year will offer easy access and ample parking.
