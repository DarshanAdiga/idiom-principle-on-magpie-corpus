A win tonight for our women will mean that they can go level on points with North London rivals Tottenham with a win over London City Lionesses in their Group B FA WSL Cup clash.


  Spurs like Arsenal fell to a defeat to London rivals Chelsea, in their fixture that took place last night. Although Tottenham’s 2-0 defeat wasn’t as embarrassing as Arsenal’s 4-1 defeat to Chelsea back in October in the first round of group games.


  However, if Arsenal win tonight and by three or more goals then they will overtake Tottenham in second place and this will put them in good stead ahead of the rest of their fixtures in this cup I am sure. They would just need to beat Tottenham and Chelsea along the way to be able to get a sniff at first place.


  No offence towards London City Lionesses but this should be a game that on paper our women are winning by five or six goals. It should be a comfortable win, but as we know from previous games, the ones we thought our team should win, they end up losing, so really anything is possible tonight.


  The women are currently sitting pretty at the top of the Women’s Super League table, two points clear ahead of the chasing pack with maximum points after five games played. But when it comes to the cup games, so far it hasn’t really been plain sailing but let’s hope tonight will be the night where they can cement their place in the cup and get win number one under their belts to get their campaign in the cup up and running. Here’s hoping hey Gooners?

WASHINGTON (The Washington Post) — The virus that has confined many Americans to their homes for much of 2020 trailed the economy as the leading issue for voters, who cast ballots in huge numbers by mail and in person, early exit polls showed Tuesday.
 About 2 in 10 voters said the pandemic that has killed more than 232,000 Americans and upended life around the globe was the most important issue on their minds as they selected a president and other officials to lead the United States out of its more than nine-month public health crisis. About the same number cited racial inequality, according to the data collected by Edison Research, a consortium of television networks.
 But about one-third said they were primarily motivated by the economy, including 6 in 10 of the voters who supported President Donald Trump.
 A slight majority of voters said it is more important to contain the coronavirus now, even if the necessary measures hurt the economy. About 4 in 10 said the economy is more important, even if restoring the nation's economic health impedes efforts to limit the spread of the virus.
 Amid the resurgence of the coronavirus in much of the United States, preliminary exit polling showed that voters are closely divided on whether U.S. efforts to contain the virus are going "well" or "badly." But roughly twice as many voters say efforts to control the pandemic have gone "very badly" than say they have gone "very well."
 Millions of voters who cast ballots in person Tuesday were braving the worst stretch of the pandemic to do so. Nearly 88,000 new infections were reported Tuesday, bringing the U.S. total to more than 9.3 million cases. The virus continued its surge through the Midwest and Plains states. Seven states set records for hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, including Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin.
 Control of the White House and the Senate was up for grabs Tuesday, circumstances not lost on voters whose families and finances have been battered by the coronavirus.
 "It's very personal to me, because it's right in my immediate family," said Betty Sullivan, 59, as she stood in line to vote in Jackson, Miss., on Tuesday morning.
 Two of Sullivan's sons and three of her grandchildren have contracted the coronavirus. Her oldest son, who is 36 and lives in Atlanta, tested positive after going to a bar. Her youngest son, 32, apparently was infected by a co- worker. Her grandchildren, ages 6, 8 and 14, contracted the virus after being in day care and school in the past three weeks, she said.
 "I think in the past, we've not really thought too much about voting; we've kind of been really, really casual about it sometimes, but, just with everything with the virus, with the pandemic, with the political climate, everybody now really realizes how important it is to get out, to come out and vote," Sullivan said.
 Regardless of the election outcome, the recent staggering increase in coronavirus cases has set the country on a difficult course for the next several weeks. A sharp rise in hospitalizations, already underway, follows the jump in infections, and a subsequent surge in deaths is expected in the weeks after that.
 "The trajectory that we're on is one that we should expect to be on for the coming weeks," said Jennifer Nuzzo, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "We should expect to be hunkered down for the coming weeks."
 Stopping a surge in the pandemic, experts said, is extremely difficult.
 "The virus doesn't know elections, doesn't know borders, doesn't know demographics," said Ali Mokdad, a University of Washington epidemiologist. "Unfortunately, the virus is taking its course irrespective of what happens today.
 "The election is not going to change the virus," Mokdad added. "Our behavior, our response to the virus, hopefully will change."
 Barring a major change in behavior, meaning much more widespread adoption of masks, social distancing and other mitigation measures, Mokdad said "some states, a large number of states, will have to do a hard stop, lockdown" by December or January.
 Although mortality rates have improved thanks to better medical techniques and drugs, the key driver of the pandemic is rampant community spread in much the country.
 "Even a vaccine won't flick any switch. There will be the hard work of actually vaccinating people," William Hanage, an epidemiologist at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in an email Tuesday.
 Columbia University epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman said part of the problem is that human behavior is not easily changed. There is "huge inertia," he said, and that will make it difficult for officials to slow outbreaks in many parts of the country.
 And if the United States follows Europe and enters a new phase of restrictions, there probably will be growing pressure for another large relief package, something Congress has been unable to agree on since the first one expired.
 "There's growing evidence about the need for providing resources to help people comply with public health recommendations," Nuzzo said. "I fear we have focused on increasing number and type of tests, but have not eliminated the disincentives that people may experience about getting tested. Lost income, in particular."
 Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said he hopes that after the election "we can come together as a country and collectively fight the virus and not each other. There are no longer red and blue states, counties or cities. They are all COVID-colored."

The Florida Supreme Court will hear arguments Feb. 6 on a proposed constitutional amendment that would expand Medicaid coverage in the state.
 The court scheduled the arguments Friday, two days after a political committee backing the proposed amendment requested oral arguments.
 The committee Florida Decides Healthcare is seeking to take the issue to voters in 2022 after Republican lawmakers have refused repeatedly in recent years to expand Medicaid to low-income adults who currently don’t qualify for coverage.
 Such an expansion is allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, with Washington picking up most of the cost for newly covered people. The Supreme Court plays a critical role because it determines whether proposed ballot wording meets legal tests, such as not being misleading.
 The Florida House and Senate filed briefs last month arguing that the Supreme Court should reject the proposed amendment on a series of grounds. But Florida Decides Healthcare filed a brief Wednesday contending that the measure meets the legal tests and should be allowed to appear on the ballot.

  # Trump seeks to stop ‘all voting,’ but only counting remains


  Mark Sherman


  Associated Press


  View Comments


  _Washington_ – President Donald Trump says he’ll take the presidential election to the Supreme Court, but it’s unclear what he means in a country in which vote tabulations routinely continue beyond Election Day, and states largely set the rules for when the count has to end.


  “We’ll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court – we want all voting to stop,” Trump said early Wednesday.


  But the voting is over. It’s only counting that is taking place across the nation. No state will count absentee votes that are postmarked after Election Day.


  Democratic challenger Joe Biden’s campaign called Trump’s statement “outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect.”


  “If the president makes good on his threat to go to court to try to prevent the proper tabulation of votes, we have legal teams standing by ready to deploy to resist that effort,” Biden Campaign Manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. “And they will prevail.”


  Election law expert Richard Hasen wrote in Slate on Sunday that “there has never been any basis to claim that a ballot arriving on time cannot be counted if officials cannot finish their count on election night.”


  Ohio State University election law professor Edward Foley wrote on Twitter Wednesday: “The valid votes will be counted. SCOTUS would be involved only if there were votes of questionable validity that would make a difference, which might not be the case. The rule of law will determine the official winner of the popular vote in each state. Let the rule of law work.”


  In any event, there’s no way to go directly to the high court with a claim of fraud. Trump and his campaign could allege problems with the way votes are counted in individual states, but they would have to start their legal fight in a state or lower federal court.


  There is a pending Republican appeal at the Supreme Court over whether Pennsylvania can count votes that arrive in the mail from Wednesday to Friday, an extension ordered by the state’s top court over the objection of Republicans. That case does not involve ballots already cast and in the possession of election officials, even if they are yet to be counted.


  The high court refused before the election to rule out those ballots, but conservative justices indicated they could revisit the issue after the election. The Supreme Court also refused to block an extension for the receipt and counting of absentee ballots in North Carolina beyond the three days set by state law.


  Even a small number of contested votes could matter if either state determines the winner of the election and the gap between Trump and Biden is so small that a few thousand votes, or even a few hundred, could make the difference.

Did you ever hear the old folks say, “They ain’t got a lick o’ sense,” in reference to the younger generation? Me too! And now I’m the one saying it! It appears as though I may be closer to being correct, though. What has happened to “having sense?” Where did we veer off the path when it came to raising kids? Was it because we didn’t require enough of them, like chores, cleaning up after themselves, or actually sweating while doing a job?
 In the last couple years I’ve had some health issues that have pulled me to a screeching halt, when it comes to my normal “git er done” speed. Things I’ve done for years, and love doing, I simply can’t or am very limited in my abilities now. I started looking for a young person who might want to learn from my years, as well as earn a few dollars. I figured the search would be short and I’d find several home grown kids who wanted to work. Imagine my shock! Where are they?
 When I was growing up, you could call any guidance counselor at the school and get kids that wanted a job and were willing laborers. You could check with neighbors because everyone knew a youth who would work and learn. What I’ve located are several young folks who want to be paid but don’t want to get a blister, mess up their nails, or get sweaty. They don’t want to get their new shoes (or jeans or shirt) dirty, or listen to instruction, or get too hot. They definitely don’t want to put their phones down, or better yet, leave it in their bag, and don’t even think of asking them to silence it.
 They generally don’t know a thing about the soil or the plants but they “know everything.” They expect me to feed and water them and give them frequent breaks, and they’re more than willing to sit and watch while I demonstrate ... which means I’m doing the job for them. Most of them can’t tell a weed from a perennial, a tree from a shrub, and forget asking them to go to the shed and retrieve the spade (not a shovel or hoe). They can’t balance a 3-wheeled wheelbarrow or push a load of manure uphill to the garden. And muck out the chicken house? Are you kidding? What about digging a “good” planting hole, hauling water from the pond, clipping grass around the flowerbeds with hand snips or getting on their hands and knees for anything?
 Maybe I’m expecting too much. I was a farm kid and I can’t remember not having chores, both inside and out. Dirt, splinters, blisters, bee stings, split nails, sore toes, and sunburns were part of my daily life. I also knew there were consequences for talking back or being disrespectful, being mean to my sister, or refusing to do what I was told – not asked – to do. Reckon it’s the “respect” thing? The more I listen to the young-ins talk, the more I’m convinced that’s the problem. They weren’t taught to respect anything. So now we have a whole crop of less-than-30’s who have no idea what to do if the power goes off, like for a long time. If they lost their phones it would be very difficult for them to communicate face-to-face. That’s a skill learned very early. They don’t know where milk and eggs come from or that an animal has to die for them to have chicken nuggets or burgers.
 I’m concerned. What happens when the “grid “goes down, and it will, eventually. These young folks will be tomorrow’s leaders, and yet they have no clue how to grow a tomato or harvest potatoes or pluck a chicken. Is this beyond help? No, but these young-ins need to seek out the wisdom of the old folks and learn, if they’re to survive. Remember, no matter how much money you have in your pocket, or how fancy your car is, or what neighborhood you live in, without clean food and water and air, you will die. Technology might be a good tool but it’s no substitute for hands-on experience under the direction of a seasoned dirt person, and there are a few of us still able to teach.
 Off my soapbox now and headed back outside to finish weeding and put down pine straw for the winter, then move and plant a few trees and shrubs and tuck the nursery in before cold. I’ll wait here if you want to learn how.

Sometimes, you have your invention ready, but you do not have any investors or companies lined up to partner with you. In such cases, you should file a provisional patent application. This application ensures that no one can patent your idea or invention up to a year from its filing. However, if the year ends and you still do not have your invention patented, then it is up for grabs. Getting patent approval can be a very lengthy and complicated process. This is why more often than not, inventors choose to consult with patent attorneys to make the process easier on themselves. This gives inventors more time to develop their products. You want to put your ideas out there so that people who are interested in it can start investing, but you do not want a company to steal your idea and patent it as one of their own, which is where specialized attorneys come in.

 Las autoridades ocuparon 362 paquetes de droga, presumiblemente cocaína, en una operación de interdicción en la playa del municipio Paya, Baní, provincia Peravia, en la que apresaron a dos colombianos.
 A través de informaciones de inteligencia, las autoridades daban seguimiento a los ocupantes de una embarcación, que fueron sorprendidos tratando de introducir el cargamento a territorio dominicano.
 Los dos extranjeros habrían llegado a las costas dominicanas procedente de Colombia y trataron de evadir la persecución. Una vez desembarcaron en la playa fueron detenidos en el acto por los agentes de la Dirección Nacional de Control de Drogas (DNCD), efectivos militares de la Armada Dominicana y miembros de la Policía, bajo la coordinación del Ministerio Público.
 En la embarcación tipo pesquera, de 28 pies de eslora, encontraron un saco blanco con 17 paquetes de droga, forrados con plástico de color negro.
 Luego se realizó una inspección más exhaustiva al bote, determinándose que tenía en su estructura tres compartimientos secretos (caletas), donde se hallaron distribuidos otros 345, para un total de 362 paquetes presumiblemente de cocaína.
 En el operativo se ocupó además un radio de comunicación, dos GPS, pilas de distintos tamaños, 14 garrafones de combustibles, un motor fuera de borda de 75 HP, una caja de herramientas, lonas, dos chalecos salvavidas, una neverita, celulares, entre otras evidencias.
 El Ministerio Público y la DNCD amplían las investigaciones en torno al caso y tratan de determinar si hay otros implicados en esta red de narcotráfico, mientras los extranjeros están siendo puestos a disposición de la justicia.
 Los 362 paquetes fueron enviados bajo cadena de custodia al Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Forenses (INACIF) para determinar tipo y peso exacto de la sustancia.

CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — Republican state Rep. Ashley Hinson defeated Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer on Tuesday to win a northeastern Iowa congressional seat. Hinson, a former television news anchor, won the House seat after an election in which she stressed the need for lower taxes, smaller government and border security. Hinson had been endorsed by President Donald Trump in the Republican primary and since the beginning of her campaign enjoyed broad support among state and national Republicans. Finkenauer lost in her first bid for reelection following her victory in 2018 over Republican Rod Blum. During her freshman term, Finkenauer devoted much of her time to ensuring disaster relief to her district after a damaging wind storm this year. She also supported legislation designed to help small businesses, aid governments amid the coronavirus pandemic and expand the Affordable Care Act. Finkenauer was 29 when elected in 2018, making her the second-youngest woman ever elected to the House. The 1st Congressional District covers 20 counties and the cities of Cedar Rapids, Dubuque and Waterloo. Hinson, 37, had a conservative voting record in the state Legislature, where she represented a House district in suburban Cedar Rapids. She supported a law deemed unconstitutional that would have banned abortions after six weeks, a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period for women seeking an abortion and another that denied funding to Planned Parenthood. Hinson also supported restrictions on felon voting and expansion of gun rights.

  # Retail therapy, last pints: England readies for new lockdown

  _London_ – Last-minute shoppers in England were out in force Wednesday and thirsty drinkers planned their final freshly poured pints in a pub for the next month as Britain prepared to join large swathes of Europe in a coronavirus lockdown designed to save its health care system from being overwhelmed.


  All non-essential venues – which in England included pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, swimming pools, entertainment venues and stores selling items like books, clothing and sneakers – must close Thursday until at least Dec. 2. That ruling came after a sudden change of course last weekend by Britain’s government, which had for weeks been advocating a targeted regional response to the pandemic instead of another national lockdown.


  Two changes from the U.K.’s spring lockdown is that this time schools and universities in England are remaining open, as are construction sites and factories.


  British lawmakers are set to approve the latest lockdown measures later Wednesday so they can take effect at midnight. Many in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party are opposed to the new lockdown, saying the response is too draconian and will devastate the economy, but the measure is sure to pass with the backing of the opposition Labour Party, which says the new restrictions should have been imposed weeks ago.


  “I don’t think any government would want to impose these measures lightly, or any parliament would want to impose these measures lightly on the people of this country,” Johnson said.


  England’s lockdown follows similar restrictions elsewhere in the U.K., which has Europe’s highest virus-related death toll at 47,250. It also follows fresh restrictions across the continent – in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, among other nations – amid mounting new COVID-19 infections and clear signals that the number of people hospitalized – and subsequently dying – from the virus are increasing,


  The World Health Organization said European countries recorded a 46% increase in virus deaths compared with the previous week and were responsible for about half of the 1.7 million new cases reported around the world last week.


  In recent days, many European nations – including Belgium, Russia, France, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and the U.K. – have reported their highest daily virus death tolls in months, and sometimes ever. The pandemic has already caused more than 1.2 million confirmed deaths – over 270,000 of them in Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll, due to missed cases and limited testing, is much higher.


  Italy, which suffered badly during the first wave of the pandemic, is also facing new curbs on freedom of movement beginning Thursday, including a nationwide overnight curfew and high schools placed on full-time distance learning.


  The country is expected to be carved up into three zones of contagion with corresponding restrictions on movement, commercial activities and school openings depending on surging infections and hospital capacity. Travel restrictions will prohibit anyone from entering or leaving a hard-hit region and restaurants and shops will close, except for supermarkets and pharmacies.

  The northern region of Lombardy, which bore the brunt of the pandemic earlier this year, is reeling under another surge, especially in its financial capital, Milan, and is expected to face harsher restrictions.


  Yet elsewhere, earlier restrictions appeared to be producing some results.


  Belgium, one of the most-affected nations in Europe, said Wednesday that new coronavirus infections and hospital admissions have started to stabilize after measures like closing pubs and restaurants were introduced weeks ago.


  “The high-speed train is slowing down,” said virologist Steven Van Gucht of the Sciensano government health group.


  But Van Gucht said it was important that people don’t let their guard down. Belgium has been recording around 1,750 cases per 100,000 people, triple the rates in Italy, Spain or the U.K.


  “Let there be no doubt that the tough rules need to be maintained,” he said.


  In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said there were some signs that closing bars and restaurants was working but that further curbs were needed. Beginning Wednesday night, Dutch cinemas, theaters, museums and pools will be closed.


  “It’s not going too bad but certainly not good enough,” Rutte told the country. “The infection numbers have to go down quicker.”


  Pope Francis urged people to be “very attentive” to measures to prevent coronavirus infections as he switched his weekly general audience Wednesday back to his private library and livestreamed the event. The move seeks to better protect the 83-year-old pope after someone at a recent public audience tested positive.


  Not all countries are going down the lockdown route. Russia has shunned a second lockdown, insisting that its health care system is able to cope with the recent surge. Still, Russia on Wednesday reported 19,768 new infections and 389 new deaths – both records.

Storm Eta pounded Nicaragua and Honduras with torrential rain on Wednesday after unleashing major floods and landslides over Central America, reportedly killing at least three people and stranding dozens of fishermen in the Atlantic. Eta, one of the most powerful storms to strike Central America in years, hit Nicaragua as a Category 4 hurricane on the five- step Saffir-Simpson scale, before weakening to a tropical storm as it forged inland in the impoverished country.

VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — A 32-year-old man has been sentenced to 15 years in prison in four separate cases. The most recent involved a shooting near Vancouver Lake that prompted a manhunt for days. The Columbian reports Clark County Superior Court Judge Daniel Stahnke on Monday accepted the attorneys’ recommended sentence of 180 months for Brad Lee Reeves of Vancouver. Senior Deputy Prosecutor Colin Hayes and defense attorney James Sowder said the stipulated sentence was reached after significant negotiations, and Reeves would have faced more time behind bars had he opted for a trial. Sowder said his client should receive more than two years of credit for time served. Reeves apologized to the victims, stating he “never had a chance growing up.” Depression and drug addiction drove his actions for years, he said. Reeves was booked April 5, 2018, into the Clark County Jail on an outstanding warrant and on suspicion of assault and attempting to elude police. The next day, he appeared in court to face those allegations and charges of failing to appear for older cases. On March 29, 2018, Reeves fired five to six shots at a man near Vancouver Lake. The victim was trying to report that he saw a woman exit and then run back to a Kia sedan occupied by Reeves on the secluded road, according to a probable cause affidavit. In early April 2018, Vancouver police tried to stop Reeves, who was driving a stolen white Ford F-250 pickup, but he fled down Interstate 5. Reeves rammed a pursuing patrol vehicle before the chase was called off near Jantzen Beach in Portland. The next day, police say Reeves was spotted driving another stolen pickup, a blue Ford F-350. He allegedly sped off and avoided arrest once more. Those three incidents led up to an overnight search April 4 in...

Arsenal has revealed their nominees for their Player of the Month for October.


  The Gunners have had an inconsistent start to the season in domestic competitions, but they have been fine in Europe with two wins from as many games in the Europa League group stages so far.


  The Gunners just came off beating Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League and some of their players were in impressive form.


  Throughout the month, the likes of Gabriel Magalhaes and Bukayo Saka stood out from the rest of their peers and they have earned a nomination for the Player of the Month.


  Gabriel won the September edition, but the Brazilian remained impressive throughout October which earned him another nomination for the month.


  Hector Bellerin was also in fine form on the right side of the defence for the Gunners last month and he has also been recognised by a nomination.


  Nicolas Pepe can be frustrating to watch, but the Ivorian scored twice and provided an assist last month to earn a nomination.


  Bukayo Saka is the final nominee. The English youngster continues to impress in the club’s first team and he scored a goal against Sheffield United last month too.

PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) — The former director of a western Kentucky nonprofit has been sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing nearly $25,000 from the organization that police said went to pay social media scammers. McCracken Circuit Court Judge W.A. “Tony” Kitchen declined a request on Monday that David Boggs, 51, receive probation, saying it would “unduly depreciate the seriousness” of the crime, The Paducah Sun reported. Boggs pleaded guilty in September to taking the money from Paducah's annual Barbecue on the River. He was arrested in May in Columbia, South Carolina, after being on the run since November 2018. Police said he took the money to pay off social media scammers after sending thousands of dollars of his own money.

PRESIDENT Republicans extended their White House winning streak in Alabama as President Donald Trump carried the state against Democrat Joe Biden and claimed nine electoral votes. The GOP has won Alabama in every presidential election since 1976, when Jimmy Carter from neighboring Georgia was on the ballot. The outcome was hardly in doubt this year given Republicans hold every statewide office but one, as well as large majorities in both houses of the Legislature. While issues including impeachment and the coronavirus pandemic threatened Trump nationally, none of that mattered in Alabama, which Trump carried handily in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. Some Republican candidates campaigned on little more than supporting Trump for a second term. The state Democratic Party was better organized this election than in 2016, and the former vice president visited Selma before the coronavirus pandemic shut down much of his campaign for months, but Biden couldn’t close a gap that has taken on historical proportions in Alabama. U.S. SENATE Former college football coach Tommy Tuberville recaptured a U.S. Senate seat for Republicans by defeating Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama on Tuesday. Jones was widely considered the Senate’s most endangered Democrat as Republicans made retaking the once reliably conservative seat a priority in the 2020 election. Tuberville has never held public office and last coached four years ago. He aligned himself closely with President Donald Trump and declared in the primary campaign that “God sent us Donald Trump.” Republicans hammered Jones over his vote to convict Trump in the Senate impeachment trial earlier this year. U.S. HOUSE Two Republican newcomers won U.S. House seats over Democrats, and two GOP incumbents were easily reelected to Congress. . ..

Data is now scattered across multiple systems and endpoints. It’s being generated constantly with less structure and standardization. Timescales have vastly accelerated, requiring different monitoring approaches that must still produce results in real time.
