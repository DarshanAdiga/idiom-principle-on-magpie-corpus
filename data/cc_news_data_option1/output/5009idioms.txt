They’re coming from more places than you may think."

The causal link is objectively assessed at three levels – by the IEC and the DSMB and the DCGI. If someone isn’t satisfied with the assessments of all three regulators, a medico-legal process is the only way to go. These complexities are also explained in the consent form, where it is also clarified that the IEC, DSMB and DCGI will determine the outcomes of any outliers, explains Dr Samiran Panda, Director of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National AIDS Research Institute (NARI) — the organisation tasked with conducting the WHO Solidarity Trial in India. The DCGI ultimately decides whether to attribute a side effect to the investigational product, or refute it. In this particular case, the causal link was not found and established, Dr Panda added.

ANSA) - BARI, 06 DIC - In una deserta Basilica di San Nicola, con la città ancora avvolta dal buio della notte ma i baresi già svegli davanti a televisori e pc per l'inizio della festa, si è celebrata alle 5 del mattino la messa per il santo di Mira, patrono di Bari. il sindaco Antonio Decaro era l'unico fedele nella chiesa, che aveva chiuso le porte per le norme anti- Covid. Alle 4.30 la città è stata svegliata come da tradizione dal suono delle campane a festa e invitata a partecipare alla celebrazione, quest'anno in diretta streaming e con divieti di stazionamento nel centro storico, mentre gli altri anni in migliaia affollavano la Basilica e la città vecchia.   "È tradizione in molti Paesi del mondo nella notte fra il 5 e il 6 dicembre attendere San Nicola portatore di doni. Anche in questa notte tormentata dalla pandemia - ha detto nell'omelia il rettore della Basilica, padre Giovanni Distante - il santo più buono della storia dell'umanità non ha mancato di visitare le nostre case. E' venuto a far sentire il calore della sua voce confortante e incoraggiante e a ricordare, soprattutto ai più piccoli, di continuare ad essere buoni".   "Noi che amiamo San Nicola - ha aggiunto - abbiamo imparato dalla sua straordinaria testimonianza di fede che nessuna sfida al mondo, neppure questa pandemia, può impedirci di vivere la fede. A dicembre come a maggio queste navate sono vuote e possono simboleggiare il deserto del cuore dove è possibile incontrare Dio per non perdere la speranza".   Alla fine della celebrazione, padre Distante ha rivolto "un saluto a tutti i pellegrini che ci seguono da lontano, che in questo giorno venivano qui per San Nicola, e ai baresi che festeggeranno nelle loro case". (ANSA).

VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis says the Christmas season provides reason for hope amid the difficulties of the coronavirus pandemic. Francis noted during his Sunday blessing that the Vatican’s Christmas tree had gone up this week in St. Peter’s Square, and work is underway to build the life-size Nativity scene next to it. Francis pointed to the tree from his studio window over the square and said such symbols of Christmas “are signs of hope, especially in this difficult period.” He urged the faithful to recall the true meaning of Christmas and lend a hand to the neediest. He said “there’s no pandemic, there’s no crisis that can extinguish this light.”

Although Cranston has regularly appeared in lighter projects throughout his career, “Your Honor” presents the latest addition to his extensive gallery of complicated figures with a dark edge.
 “I am attracted to damaged characters that still have some manner of humanity and decency within them, despite their flaws and shortcomings,” he says while relaxing in the large, leafy backyard of his San Fernando Valley home. “Audiences relate to people like that, saying, ‘I’m not good at that, but what would I do in this situation?’ When I tell people the elevator pitch of what ‘Your Honor’ is about, to a person, they say, ‘I would do the same thing. I would do anything to protect the life of my child.’”
 Some viewers may see some similarities between Desiato and White, who first turned to a life of crime after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. His initial goal was to make enough money to provide for his survivors. Although White and Desiato, at least at first, are both dedicated family men with good intentions, Cranston says there are clear differences between the two.
 “Walter White made a very methodical decision, where Michael makes a very impulsive decision,” he says. “In ‘Your Honor,’ he has no time to think of the repercussions or to really assess what the possible damage could be down the road. It’s right here, right now. For him at that moment, it was the right decision. My character wasn’t about to take a chance that this mob boss wouldn’t harm my child.”

“I’m just so proud of ‘Breaking Bad’ and recognize it changed my life,” says Cranston. “It gave me opportunities professionally that I may never have had otherwise. It was a huge stroke of luck in many ways, and a daring, bold, audacious attempt at storytelling. [Creator] Vince Gilligan pulled it off, and we were along for the ride. We contributed, but the template was there in the writing.”
 And he is aware that the anticipation is growing for the next installment of “Better Call Saul” to merge with “Breaking Bad,” bringing the saga of Walter White full circle.

It’s also a series that speaks to our divisive political environment, in which facts often take a back seat to twisted theories, Cranston maintains.
 “Michael is using his 30 years as a lawyer and judge to re-engineer a new reality, a new reality for his son,” he says. “He has to erase what really happened to create the new reality. Audiences are certainly prepped for that because we see it in our political sphere. What is it that [former counselor to President Trump] Kellyanne Conway said? Alternative facts.”

Giersbergen has stated that this newest project is inspired in part by heartbreak. The album's title refers to the idea that, when facing personal challenges, we are forced to find answers to life's biggest questions. “My Promise” is the first peek into the long-awaited new effort from the artist, and her words about the albums themes and motifs are certainly verified in it. The new singles lyrics in a lot of ways are embodied perfectly in its music video, in which Giersbergen herself is performing in an eatery to an audience of lovers from across the relationship spectrum. There is a proposal, smiles shared between an older couple and even first date nerves on display here. Captivating as she is, Giersbergen jaunts along to the stringed arrangement backing her with her soft yet expressive melodies paving momentum.

In Long Beach, for example, the findings of the Citizen Police Complaint Commission are often disputed by the city manager because the group isn’t privy to statements officers provide in administrative investigations. Last year, the commission sustained 52 claims of misconduct, but the city manager — who has final say — sustained only five.
 “It is frustrating for us to see those decisions overturned,” said Christian Cooper, the commission’s chair. “We’re doing the best we can with information that we have.”
 And in Inglewood, the city’s police oversight commission exists only “on paper,” according to Mayor James T. Butts.
 He said there was no official decision to end the meetings but that the commission had lacked a quorum and it “just fell apart.” It could make discipline recommendations but didn’t have investigatory authority.

So, when personal protective equipment was in short supply with the coronavirus spreading across the U.S., he felt he could help.He set up 15 3D printers in his living room, turning it into a makeshift factory, and started printing masks around the clock.When PPE was in short supply with the coronavirus spreading across the U.S., 26-year-old Jason Erdreich, a middle school shop teacher, stepped up, helping to produce more than 12,000 pieces of vital equipment for frontline workers.“I mean, I had to,” Erdreich told CNN. “I had the resources to help, I was able to help, I couldn’t not help others that were doing so much to help us. Frontline workers were, and are, doing so much to care for us. Someone needs to make sure they are taken care of, too. I’m glad I was able to contribute to that.”He also taught others what he knew, and together, they produced more than 12,000 pieces of PPE for hospitals, nursing homes and frontline workers.Now, Erdreich is one of 50 people Mazda is honoring with an MX-5 Miata 100th Anniversary Special Edition.“This has been a truly incredible experience. I feel very fortunate, and I am endlessly appreciative to my colleagues, students, administrators, community members and my wife that really helped make all of the PPE in the thick of the pandemic – and even more so for the frontline workers we were making the PPE for,” he said.Copyright 2020 CNN Newsource.

During construction times, my employees once woke me up at 3 am to tell me that there was a fisherman in our lagoon fishing on the house reef too close to the resort. I grabbed my big torch and walked through the jungle to the direction the fisherman was driving off to. When I caught up with him from the beach, I pointed my torch directly at him to make him come over. Now, imagine a Papuan fisherman in the dark of the night seeing a white woman on an island he thought was still deserted! The poor man thought he was seeing a ghost! I will never forget his eyes as big as saucers. He froze and just stared at me without saying a word until I started explaining that there were now people on Pulau Pef and that we were constructing a resort.
