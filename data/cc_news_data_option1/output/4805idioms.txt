A new technologic solution that would eventually take the current infrastructure’s place, should address this issue and allow users to track the journey of their data until it becomes anonymised. That is also related to enhanced transparency, users nowadays are not granted with adequate visibility of their data flow and therefore don’t trust the handling of it.”_

Ron, a longtime baker who has a cookbook coming out in January, starting in the kitchen with his mom and aunts. All of the baked goods in the shop are created from his recipes.
 "Baking has been a release and an outlet I've enjoyed my entire life," he said. "I am a perpetual learner and am always perfecting recipes and trying new ones. It got to the point where I was giving so many cakes and desserts away that I started competing in shows, which brought success.
 "Eventually, I wanted to see what it would look like to open a storefront."
 Nick said those working at Skratch Bakery put their heart and soul into their baked goods by only using the best ingredients.
 "It's good stuff because we make it the way we want to eat it and not just to be sold," he said. "We have a high standard of excellence within our family and we believe in, not just the food, but the effort and love that goes into the food. We put that into every single bite as much as possible."
 Although the bakery is nly offering carry-out during the pandemic, the Kelly family hopes to open things up again as the lobby was created to feel comfortable, with antique decor.
 "The atmosphere feels like you are home and that's what we go for in our decor and in friendliness to associates and customers alike," Nick said. "We make sure we go the extra mile because we want to make a business that we would want to go to."
 _Skratch Bakery, at 862 S.W. Blue Parkway in Lee's Summit, is open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday. Visit them @sKratchbakery, or skratchbakery.com or call 816-434-5330._

The victim and surviving family members are not being considered again.
 The state is thinking again about giving inmates "good time" off their sentence for good behavior and successful programming-again-no thought to the victims and their surviving families. It is already bad enough that rarely does the sentence handed down match the crime, and it is also bad enough that the victims have to endure this, but now to shorten an already inadequate sentence is another slap in the face/
 It should be against the law to shorten anyone's sentence who has committed murder, DUI Fatal, child molestation and others.If the state ends up doing this it should be for very small and limited kinds of crimes. Wrongly, the consideration is always about the perpetrator. For all the "bleeding hearts" who think reducing sentences seems like a great idea, put yourself in the victims or their family's shoes for once and try to imagine their hurt and betrayal.Where are the advocates for the victims, the criminal has far too many.

Lia Wälti and Malin Gut however are in the Swiss squad for that game against Belgium as Switzerland need a point to qualify for the finals in England in 2022
 Wälti has been praising Gut as she told Arsenal.com on their understanding of one another’s games: “I obviously knew her a bit before because I’m always watching the national team under-17s and under-19s to see what talents we have.
 “Malin was always one of the better players in the youth national teams, so I knew she was going to be in the senior team pretty quick.
 “I think it was two years ago when she came up and played her first games, and she’s just someone who really impressed me from the start.
 “You can’t really see that she isn’t as experienced because she’s pretty calm, she looks really confident on the ball and that was really impressive to see from a young player.”
 “There are many young players who are maybe still a bit wild or don’t really have the structure in their game yet, but she really brought that from the first moment.
 “That’s why she impressed me from the start, “I didn’t tell Joe not to get Malin, I was definitely one of the people who said she had a really big talent.”

The repatriated earnings stood at $548.1 million in the corresponding period of the last year. However, the repatriation in October fell to $101.9 million, compared with $169.2 million sent by the multinational companies to their headquarters overseas in the same period of the last fiscal year.
 Data issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP further revealed that foreign companies repatriated $648.2 million worth of profit against the foreign direct investments in various businesses in July-October FY2021. That compared with $499.3 million in the corresponding period last year.
 Moreover, they sent profits worth $30.5 million against investments in shares at the local bourse. These earnings stood at $48.9 million a year earlier. Food sector remained on the top, repatriating an amount of $161.4 million to overseas in July-October FY2021, while the outflows were $44 million a year ago.
 Profit outflows from the communications sector increased to $118.7 million from $6.2 million. Financial businesses repatriated $91 million in the first four months of FY2021, compared with $112.1 million in the same period of FY2020.
 The SBP figures showed that $275.4 million was repatriated to the United Kingdom in the period under review, followed by the United States ($109.2 million) and Malta (91.7 million). Analysts said the improvement in the economic activity, better corporate profitability and relaxation in conditions for profit repatriation contributed to this increase.
 The foreign investor’s confidence in Pakistan's economy is restoring. The momentum in the economy has gained traction on the back of the government and the SBP stimulus. Furthermore, country’ gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to hover around 2.0-2.5 percent in FY2021.
 The expected resumption in the International Monetary Fund’s loan programme may also bode well for investor confidence in the economy in the days to come.

This is a play we have seen time and time again for Leeds this season, and one which will continue to stretch opponents and catch teams out. Leeds' ability to make a rigid defence appear wide open in a matter of seconds is indicative of patterns that have been worked on continually at Thorp Arch.
 Secondly, Raphinha's movement allowed the likes of Patrick Bamford to get valuable time on the ball. Given the way Arsenal set up, in a low block from around the 25th minute onwards, Bamford was understandably starved of service.
