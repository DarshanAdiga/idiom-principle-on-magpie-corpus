In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and mostly without federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.

Why this happened is a bit of a puzzle. But Wolf found what she thinks was a clue.

Wolf hypothesizes that giving up the chew-and- pour approach "was really going out on a limb" for these teachers. So in the face of even indirect pushback from parents, the child-centered approach "was the natural thing for teachers to step back on."

Along with punters, long-snappers and holders, offensive guards are often among the most anonymous players on a high school football roster.
 And Radson Ngirasob doesn’t mind one bit.
 The senior guard for Lawton High isn’t a big talker, often having to speak up just so his words can be heard. And while may not start every game and may not get a ton of attention, those things don’t matter much to him.
 “I know what I’m doing and I know what I’m doing is good. I don’t need a lot of people to know,” Ngirasob said. “ At the end of the day, if we win, that’s all that matters. It doesn’t matter who gets recognition.”
 He might not get recognition from fans, but the LHS coaching staff certainly knows all about the kind of player and person Ngirasob is.
 “Top of the line kid, doesn’t talk a whole lot but highly intelligent kid, product of the program who does a real good job for us,” Lawton High head coach Ryan Breeze said.
 Ngirasob is now a 6’0, 275-pound senior, but just three years ago, he weighed nearly 100 pounds lighter. Thanks to the strength and conditioning program at Lawton High, he’s gotten stronger, faster and in much better shape.
 “I was much smaller, but I’ve just focused these past few years, try to turn into a good football player,” he said.
 At six feet, he might not be the tallest guard, but neither is one of his o-line idols, Quenton Nelson of the Indianapolis Colts. While the All-Pro guard might be more outspoken, he still has traits that Ngirasob commends.
 “He’s shorter than everybody else but he has a great work ethic and I admire that,” Ngirasob said.
 Away from the field, Radson enjoys hanging out with friends, but said his main relaxation activity is painting, something he’s been doing since 7th grade.
 “It soothes me, I like to listen to music while I do that,” Ngirasob said.
 Born in the state of Washington before moving to Lawton-Fort Sill due to family military commitments, Ngirasob lives with his parents and sibling, but says most of his family is back in Micronesia, the group of islands in the Pacific Ocean where his family is based out of. And his mom still provides some island flavor from time to time.
 “She cooks really good fish, like Rainbow Trout, I like how she grills it,” he said.
 Post-graduation, Radson said he wants to go to college and study medicine in hopes of becoming a physical therapist. Until then, he wants to be remembered as a player who set an example with his deeds, not words.
 “To be a leader, I just try to lead by example,” he said. “If (younger players) mess up, I try to work with them one-on-one, and tell them they’ve got the next one.”

A proposal to bring a graduated income tax to Illinois was heading for defeat Tuesday although supporters of the idea would not concede.
   
 With nearly 88% of precincts reporting, the amendment was losing with 55% voting "no" and 45% voting "yes." The "no" votes outnumbered the "yes" by nearly 458,000.
      
 Opponents of the amendment issued statements Tuesday night claimed victory. The Vote No on the Progressive Tax Coalition thanked voters "for preserving jobs and defeating the Springfield politicians' tax increase."
   
 Illinois Chamber of Commerce President Todd Maisch said the issue came down to trust.
   
 "It is clear that the majority of the electorate doesn't trust their state government with their precious tax dollars  
 However, Vote Yes for Fairness, which supported the amendment, refused to concede.
   
 "We are encouraged by the Illinoisans who cast their ballots in support of the Fair Tax despite the onslaught of misinformation and lies from those who were desperate to defeat the amendment," the organization said in a statement. ""Until every ballot is counted, we will stand with the Illinoisans who cast a ballot by mail, early and in-person today to ensure their voices are heard."
   
 To be become part of the state Constitution, the amendment must be approved by 60% of the people voting on the amendment or get over 50% of the total votes cast in the election. Neither possibility looks likely.
   
 If the amendment fails, it would be a major setback for Gov. JB Pritzker who has made approval of the amendment a cornerstone of his administration. The amendment was a major part of Pritzker's agenda as he campaigned for governor. He pushed to have lawmakers approve placing it on the ballot a full year before the election.
   
 Pritzker's office did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday night. During a coronavirus briefing earlier in the day, he repeated that; a tax increase on all taxpayers -- which he said would be regressive under the current system -- will be necessary along with deep budget cuts if the amendment failed.
   
 Pritzker also put significant amounts of his own fortune behind the effort in a campaign that was described as a battle of billionaires. Illinois' richest man, Ken Griffin, contributed significant amounts of his own money to the campaign to defeat the amendment.
   
 Voters were asked if the state should change from a flat tax system to one where different rates are charged at different income levels. The higher a person's income, the higher the tax rate that person would pay. It is the system used by the federal government and most of the states that have a state income tax.
   
 Lawmakers approved tax rates that will be applied if the amendment is approved. Proponents said those rates would result in 97% of taxpayers paying the same or less than they do now. Only those making more than $250,000 would see a tax increase.
   
 The new tax rates are estimated to raise an additional $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion for the state. Proponents said that it is revenue badly needed for the state to cope with its ongoing financial problems, including pension debt and a large bill backlog.
   
 Proponents called the graduated income tax the "Fair Tax" because they said it would force millionaires and billionaires to pay their "fair share" of state taxes.
   
 Opponents largely ignored that argument and played to voter cynicism about state government. They conducted an expansive campaign in which they said graduated rates will make it easier for lawmakers to raise income taxes on all income levels in the future, particularly the middle class, despite a study that showed lawmakers reluctant to raise income taxes regardless of the system their states used.
   
 Opponents also raised the specter of Illinois beginning to tax retirement income which is currently exempt from state income taxes. Ads said the amendment would give lawmakers "new power" to tax retirement income even though they already have that power.

BROCKTON -- Typically, when the last name Colombo is mentioned in Brockton circles, it's about the legendary Boxers football coach and others from the Italian family who were known for their exploits on the gridiron.
 But for Jack Colombo, sports was never his forte, instead applying his creative skills in the field of music.
 Jack Colombo, 61, recalled going to a physical education class in high school led by his father's cousin, Armond Colombo, the late, renowned Brockton High School coach whose football teams won nine Eastern Mass. Division 1 Super Bowl championships.
 "I went to gym and Armond used to say, 'Go to the Fine Arts Building,'" Jack Colombo said. "My claim to fame is I'm the only Colombo who existed with no athletic ability."

 Colombo, a full-time musician and lifelong Brocktonian, was named a KORG USA- endorsed artist this year, as the keyboard company recognizes him for a career of accomplishments, including performances with 140 different acts with top 50 hit songs.
 Colombo, as a multi-keyboard performer, pianist, arranger and producer, has played with award-winning groups like The Drifters, featuring Charlie Thomas, serving as the group's music director for 23 years. He's also played concerts around the country and arranged music for The Lettermen, Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, The O'Jays, Bowzer of Sha Na Na, Ben E. King, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, The Manhattan Transfer and many others.
 Colombo is joining a long list of KORG artists that is highlighted by legends of the music industry like Phil Collins and Herbie Hancock.
 "I'm in good company," said Colombo, speaking recently by phone. "I'm humbly happy about it. It's a godsend. The opportunity doesn't come along people's way a lot. The keyboards are difficult endorsements. The products are a lot of money. It's different than drumsticks or guitar sponsorships. Those are more easy to come by."
 Colombo is founder, co-owner and an instructor at the Southeast School of Music in Easton.
 And Colombo has directed oldies music specials for PBS, made music for television commercials, served as music director for a Boston City Hall Plaza concert series, directed ballet pop concern series, provided a soundtrack for a Pittsburgh Steelers pre-game show, orchestrated a private Super Bowl celebration for the New England Patriots, directed music for the Catholic Tri- Parishes of Brockton and led national artist shows for Caribbean and Alaskan cruise companies. He also worked for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a musical director for three years. And he put together the The Drifters vocalists reunion in 2005 that aired on PBS.
 Colombo has shared his love of music with his daughter, Tori Colombo, a seventh grader at West Middle School, who has joined him on stage, including once with The Drifters playing percussion at just nine years old in 2017 at Stadium Theatre in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Jack Colombo said he started playing organ and piano at age 9, first playing professionally as a 16-year- old at local function halls and family parties, calling the rock organ his "first love."
 "It was really cool as a dad to see her on stage," Colombo said. "And it was really cool for them, too. She was the youngest person to ever perform with The Drifters. It was awesome."
 Colombo said his daughter also brought her percussion rig on stage to join him and Bowzer from Sha Na NA in front of an audience of 16,000 people at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during an oldies rock concert in 2018.
 "I think it is crazy to have a dad that has played in front of thousands of people," Tori Colombo said, during a break from remote learning classes, congratulating her father on the Korg artist endorsement. "I'm really happy. He always works hard no matter what. I'm glad this happened for him. It's amazing how he gets recognized everywhere and how he's so talented on the piano. It really is a blessing to have a dad that amazing."
 Colombo said another cool moment in his career was when he was complimented by singer and songwriter Paul Simon, who was in the audience for a 60s music show headlined by The Drifters at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey around five years ago or so.
 "I was in disbelief," said Colombo, adding that he would have been a lot more nervous performing had he known Simon was in the crowd. "He said, 'You know, I'm not a fan of four-piece groups, but you guys really pulled it off and it sounded amazing.' I thought that was an awesome compliment."
 When Colombo became a musical director for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, it opened up a new world for him, as he began to work with great singers, musicians and nationally renowned bands who made so many top hit songs.
 "I played with like 18 groups the first time around who had top hits, including Mary Wilson, The Manhattan Transfer and Al Jardine," Colombo said. "That kind of opened up that whole world and got me really involved in that circuit. Then everything became wide open. The floodgates opened up."
