WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr defended the aggressive federal law enforcement response to civil unrest in America, saying on Tuesday "violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests" sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police.
 Barr told members of the House Judiciary Committee at a much-anticipated election year hearing the violence taking place in Portland, Oregon, and other cities is disconnected from Floyd's killing, which he called a "horrible" event that prompted a necessary national reckoning on the relationship between the Black community and law enforcement.
 "Largely absent from these scenes of destruction are even superficial attempts by the rioters to connect their actions to George Floyd's death or any legitimate call for reform," Barr said of the Portland protests.
 The hearing marks Barr's first appearance before the House Judiciary Committee after 18 months in office, bringing him face-to-face with a panel that voted last year to hold him in contempt and is holding hearings on what Democrats say is politicization of the Justice Department under his watch. It comes during tumultuous stretch in which Barr has taken actions cheered by President Donald Trump but condemned by Democrats and other critics.
 Among those actions is the Justice Department's decision to drop the prosecution of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn and Barr's urging for a more lenient sentence for Trump ally Roger Stone, a move that prompted the entire trial team's departure. Trump later commuted the sentence entirely.
 Opening the hearing, committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said the Trump administration had "twisted the Department of Justice into a shadow of its former self," serving the powerful before average Americans. He said the committee has a responsibility to protect Americans "from that kind of corruption."
 Nadler said Barr had "aided and abetted" Trump's worst impulses and excoriated him and the Justice Department for turning a blind eye to necessary reforms to police departments, for dismissing Black Lives Matter protests and for flooding streets with federal agents to stop protesters.
 Republicans hit back hard in defense of Barr and Trump's administration. The top Republican on the panel, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, used his opening statement to show an eight-minute video that spliced together images of violence by protesters around the country, showcasing law enforcement officers under attack in Chicago, Portland and New York. The images were cut from hundreds of hours of racial injustice footage of largely peaceful protests around the nation.
 Under combative questioning, Barr acerbically defended himself but revealed little new information about his motivations or the Justice Department's recent actions on policing or otherwise. Fuming Democrats often used their five minutes to lay out their frustrations and cut him off as he attempted to answer questions.
 "Many of the Democrats on this Committee have attempted to discredit me by conjuring up a narrative that I am simply the President's factotum who disposes of criminal cases according to his instructions," Barr said in his opening statement. "Judging from the letter inviting me to this hearing, that appears to be your agenda today."
 On policing, Barr's testimony underscores the Justice Department's ongoing effort to differentiate between increasing violence in some cities and Floyd's death, which has led to state charges against four officers and is under investigation by federal authorities. Massive but peaceful demonstrations followed Floyd's death in May.
 The attorney general, speaking as Congress and the public pay respects in the Capitol to the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, acknowledged to lawmakers Floyd's death struck a chord in the Black community because it reinforced concerns Black people are treated differently by police. But he condemned Americans who he says have responded inappropriately to Floyd's death through what he said was rioting and anarchy.
 "As elected officials of the federal government, every member of this committee — regardless of your political views or your feelings about the Trump administration — should condemn violence against federal officers and destruction of federal property," Barr said. "So should state and local leaders who have a responsibility to keep their communities safe."
 Civil unrest escalated in Portland after federal agents were accused of whisking people away in unmarked cars without probable cause; the people were detained and later released. And in Washington, D.C., peaceful protesters were violently cleared from the streets by federal officers using smoke bombs and pepper balls last month before a photo op by Trump in front of St. John's church, where Barr had accompanied him.
 Barr defended the broad use of law enforcement power to deal with the situation, noting that protesters had earlier set fire to the church and "it was total consensus that you couldn't allow that to happen so close to the White House." The department's internal watchdog has opened investigations into use of force and other tactics by agents in Washington and Portland.
 He also said the force was used because the protesters would not disperse from the area when law enforcement officials were trying to move back the security perimeter, a decision made the night before. When pressed on details, he pointed to the investigations.
 The use of pepper spray is warranted, even if peaceful protesters are also harmed, he said.
 Beyond the federal response to the demonstrations, Barr was pressed in detail about his intervention in the Flynn and Stone cases, both of which arose from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Democrats criticized him for partly taking into account Stone's health and age, 67, and said those standards haven't been used in other similar cases.
 While Stone's health was one of the factors considered by senior level officials at the Justice Department, the point of the contention about the sentencing recommendation was over whether a specific sentencing enhancement over witness tampering would apply. Barr said that enhancement is "traditionally applied to mafiosos" and he didn't agree that it was warranted in Stone's case.
 Barr said he told the acting U.S. attorney that "we are going to leave it up to the judge" and that he ordered the revised recommendation to be filed whent the line prosecutors submitted an initial recommendation calling for a sentence of seven to nine years.
 "And even though I knew I would get a lot of criticism for doing that, I think at the end of the day my obligation is to be fair to the individual," Barr said.
 Republicans and Democrats also repeatedly revisited Mueller's probe, with Democrats arguing he downplayed the report to the public before it was released and Republicans pressing him on the origins of the probe. The department is investigating the department's decisions as it started investigating Trump's ties to Russia during the Obama administration in 2016.
 In a prepared opening statement released by the department, Barr derisively referred to "the bogus 'Russiagate' scandal." Barr didn't read that part of his statement in the hearing room, but defended his actions as he has questioned the probe.

What's eerie about an outbreak, every outbreak I've run, is that in the beginning it's always quiet. In February the country was going along its way. On February 1st, the surgeon general even tweeted, "Roses are red, violets are blue, risk is low for the coronavirus but it's high for the flu." February 1st, president trump, he's at mar-a-lago. He's playing golf, he's hosting a super bowl party. The first thing he does in February is he bans travel to and from China. The U.S. Is closing the door to slow the spread of novel coronavirus. And he then goes on to basically brag about it on fox News. Coronavirus. How concerned are you? Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. It was a good idea to do travel restriction from China because it was clear that that's the source that was seeding us. The truth is, that the travel ban was probably already too late when it was put into place. And the world didn't know it, but the virus had already jumped continents because of that commerce very early on. As February develops, the president proceeds to downplay the virus. You know a lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat. But behind the scenes, a group of people, current and former senior federal government officials, top doctors, are engaged in a series of email chains called red dawn. I had seen the movie, yes. A pretty good, cheesy, 1980s classic. Will wufl Ver eens? Our group has been referred to as the wolverines, you know, how I guess we're the group in the movie that saved the united States. These signs were out there pretty early. The surprise, to us, was that folks weren't learning this out of the official channels that should have been broadcasting that information. On my email, some Pentagon officials had essentially written off this pandemic as a bad flu. And so, this was my somewhat tongue-in-cheek response to that. And I described Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, just a little stroll gone bad. Pompeii, a bit of a dust storm. And Wuhan, just a bad flu season. The red dawn group ultimately becomes fixated on a cruise ship in the far east, the diamond princess because of an outbreak of the coronavirus onboard. Today 70 new cases of the virus have been confirmed onboard the ship. Reading from the red don email chain, the case count is now up to 136. This is unbelievable. We are so far behind the curve. So the diamond princess was one red flag amongst a sea of red flags at that point of what we should have been doing as Americans to be prepared. As you know in those early days, we still had not ramped up testing in the United States. When there's a new pathogen like this, you know, the CDC sets out to develop a test. That's routinely what we do, and we do it very well. Which they did, and they did in record time, seven to ten days. And initially we were all flooded with relief. We can test. And they immediately came across a problem. The initial samples that came from the CDC that were sent out didn't work. So they had to call them back. And so the CDC then had to send out a second batch of test kits, which also had a problem. And as the weeks ticked by, we were running out of time to contain the spread of this virus, and we knew it. It took us about, close to four to five weeks to figure out the contamination, and within five weeks we got the test to the health departments throughout the nation, which I would still say is pretty record time. In an outbreak scenario, every day matters. Our chances to contain this virus were gone. We could have brought in the gigantic manufacturers of diagnostic tests, and our failure to take that approach with a homegrown test out of CDC has cost us lives. I don't think CDC will manufacture tests in the future. I think what we'll do is we'll contract a manufacturer to manufacture the tests. This is pretty much the most critical time in the outbreak for us to be flying blind. The virus was seeding America, and sadly, lives were lost. On Valentine's day weekend, I was part of a number of square dance of events where I and many others contracted covid-19. If we had known, we could have taken some precautions or we might have been able to cancel or we might have done something different. Within two weeks, the first person in the square dance community would be dead. It was a very sad -- it was a very sad time. And it still is because these people were good people. And they were my friends. And they were taken from us. By the middle of February, the federal government was only processing about 100 covid-19 tests a day. Meanwhile, alarm bells are ringing all around the world. So far, 454 cruise passengers have been infected. And then as February developed, president trump held a series of campaign rallies -- I think it's going to work out fine. I think when we get into April and the warm weather that has a very negative affect on that. Near the end of February some of the testing becomes more available. The CDC began to ship out the new version of the test. In Kirkland, Washington, Dr. Francis riedo decides he's going to randomly test two of his patients. And, shockingly, they both come back as positive for coronavirus. I knew this was -- this was the event. This was now the beginning, everything changed at that point. And that's when we first started realizing the first community spread that was not related to an identifiable source. Without a doubt February was a lost month for this nation's response. It's going to disappear, one day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear. Meanwhile, the CDC is confirming the first covid-19 death in the United States. The disconnect between what the president was saying and what we knew to be the science, it was frightening. Obviously there was a failure of leadership in dealing with this pandemic, without question. It was too late. The outbreaks were already out of control. There was no way to stop it at that point. We had missed our chance to contain it. There was a parade of ambulances coming from lifecare.                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Built in 1975, the parking garage contains 338 spaces. However, the facility has been underutilized in recent years with officials saying more than half the spaces were vacant each day. Officials are hoping the upgrades and a new rate schedule will increase the garage's usage.                  "We've done some work over the years ... we upgraded the electrical system and lighting and make expansion joint repairs and did work on the elevator," said Jeff Rhodes, city administrator. "But this will be the final step to make a restored garage. The idea is to bring it up to date and hopefully it will encourage more people to use it. It also makes it an automated garage, so we don't have to pay for manpower to be there and operate it."                   Morriss said, "The garage functions like a modern garage now. We're excited about it. It also lowers the rates for the average permit parking and hopefully makes it more attractive to people that are using our downtown."                  Currently, the spaces are leased according to a three-tier payment structure of $90, $75 and $55 per month, depending on the location in the garage.                  Under the new plan, Rhodes said the $75 option will be eliminated in favor of a two-tier structure of $80 per month for those accessing the Union Street entrance spaces and $55 for the spaces accessed from the George Street entrance.                  "We lowered the rate of the high-end parking in there to try to get more folks to use it," said Rhodes. "We will also continue hourly parking at $1 per hour with a maximum of $8 per day."                  Other changes in downtown parking arrangements include a shift in free parking, which will be discontinued at Lot No. 1 across from Atlantic Broadband. However, free spaces will now be available at Lot No. 6 between Pepper's Restaurant Supply and the Howell Sunoco Station, beneath Interstate 68.                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

July 28 (Reuters) - Adam Lallana says Brighton & Hove Albion's ambition was a major factor in his decision to join the club from Premier League champions Liverpool.
 Lallana, who has won 34 England caps, joined the Seagulls for free on a three- year contract after spending six years at Liverpool.
 "It's a breath of fresh air coming here. It's a challenge I am looking forward to," the 32-year-old told Brighton's website.
 "The whole infrastructure and ambition around the club excites me. There is so much young talent and so much ability. It was a pretty easy choice for me in the end.
 "I look at how ambitious the chairman is to start with and how highly the manager is regarded since he has come into the club. I looked at all those aspects... and it was a perfect fit really."
 Brighton finished 15th in the Premier League this season with 41 points, their best-ever points tally in England's top-flight. (Reporting by Arvind Sriram in Bengaluru Editing by Christian Radnedge)

CNN has previously reported on Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, as it is the subject in a wrongful death lawsuit filed earlier in July.

Adds quotes, context on border tensions)
 BEIRUT, July 28 (Reuters) - Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab said on Tuesday Israel had violated his country's sovereignty with a "dangerous military escalation" along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier on Monday, and called for caution after a rise in border tensions.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had thwarted an attempt by the Iran-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah to infiltrate across the Lebanese frontier on Monday. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite group denied this.
 A Reuters witness in Lebanon counted dozens of Israeli shells hitting the disputed Shebaa Farms area.
 "I call for caution in coming days because I fear the situation will deteriorate in light of heightened tensions on our border," Diab said on Twitter.
 Israel was trying to "change the rules of engagement," he said.
 Israeli forces have been on alert along the northern border in anticipation of Hezbollah retaliation for the killing of one of its members a week ago in an alleged Israeli attack on the edge of the Syrian capital Damascus.
 Occupied by Israel, the Shebaa Farms is claimed by Lebanon. The United Nations regards it as part of Syrian territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
 Netanyahu has said any attacks from Lebanese territory will draw a powerful response. Hezbollah, which last fought a war with Israel in 2006, denied its forces had tried to cross the frontier and said the incident was "one-sided".
 After the killing of two Hezbollah members in Damascus last August, the group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, vowed to respond if Israel killed any of its fighters in Syria. But Hezbollah's deputy leader said on Sunday all-out war with Israel was unlikely.
 Hezbollah fighters deployed in Syria as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad. Israel sees the presence of Hezbollah and Iran in Syria as a strategic threat, and has mounted raids on Iranian-linked targets.

But there is a silver lining, or really a sliver of a silver lining in the name of Zack Godley.
 The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Godley’s four measly-but-great innings in Monday night’s third straight debilitating loss, 7-4 to the N.Y. Mets, is the best news over the losing streak.
 The loss was another early blowout, leaving Red Sox bats to save the day.
 But there is something about trailing 4-0 every game, before your starting pitcher hits 35 pitches, that can take the sails out of a great one.
 The Mets were up 7-0 before the Sox were up in the fourth inning and basically mailed in the rest of the game.
 “It’s tough,” said Red Sox “captain” Xander Bogaerts, trying to be nice. “It’s not like it’s one run.”
 That’s where Godley comes in.
 Godley, who didn’t have a job 10 days earlier and was in fact delegated to the Boston Red Sox 30-man taxi-squad in Pawtucket, has already earned a spot in the starting rotation.
 The new normal.
 Of course there are extenuating circumstances. David Price (trade/salary dump) is gone forever. Chris Sale (Tommy John surgery) is out for at least one year. And Eduardo Rodriguez (COVID-19) is out for at least two weeks.
 The 2018 Red Sox rotation this is not.
 There are other extenuating circumstances, as in Martin Perez, Ryan Weber and Josh Osich, three guys you’ve probably never heard of.
 They were also Games 2, 3 and 4 starters.
 It is a tad unfair to destroy the Red Sox season four or five days into it. Sure, it doesn’t look good, particularly the four starters after Nathan Eovaldi, but losing Rodriguez was unplanned and unfortunate.

The USDA’s regulations for labeling genetically engineered food have come under fire in a lawsuit that accuses the agency of violating the federal law requiring such disclosures.                                  The complaint filed by the Center for Food Safety, as well as grocers and other nonprofits, alleges that USDA’s labeling rules are so narrow or restrictive as to misguide consumers about genetically engineered food ingredients.                                  “Unfortunately, in its final decision the agency fell far short of fulfilling the promise of meaningful labeling of GE foods,” the complaint said. “In fact in many ways the result is in the direct or de facto concealment of these foods and avoidance their labeling.”                                  A representative of the USDA said the agency has “no comment due to pending litigation.”                                  Before Congress enacted the Bioengineered Food Disclosure Act in 2016, controversies over mandatory labeling for genetically engineered foods swirled for years at the state level. Vermont, Maine and Connecticut passed GE labeling laws while voters in Oregon, Washington and California rejected ballot initiatives mandating them.                                  The federal law was intended to establish a nationwide labeling system, with the USDA implementing the statute with regulations that were enacted in late 2018.                                  However, the plaintiffs claim that USDA’s regulations violate the Bioengineered Food Disclosure Act as well as free speech rights and administrative law.                                  First of all, the USDA allows companies to disclose “bioengineered” food on labels with a matrix “quick response” bar code, despite findings from its own study that determined many shoppers don’t have access to smart phones or the internet, or don’t know how to use that technology, the complaint said.                                  This rule doesn’t comply with the disclosure statute’s requirement that packages contain an “additional and comparable” labeling method, in addition to the matrix bar code, according to the complaint.                                  “Even if consumers had access and knowledge to use a QR Code, it is unrealistic for a shopper to scan all of the many items they are shopping for on any given shopping trip,” the plaintiffs claim. “This would be an undue burden on the consumer and greatly impede access to information that is currently required for all other forms of food labeling.”                                  Secondly, the USDA has required labels to use the term “bioengineering” rather than more common terminology, such as “genetically engineered” or “genetically modified,” which is used by the agency itself in other contexts, the complaint alleges.                                  While the Congress used “bioengineering” in the disclosure law, the statute also allowed “any similar term” to be used on label packaging, so the USDA’s prohibition against the other words “is contrary to the plain language of the statute,” the plaintiffs claim.                                  “The record evidence overwhelmingly indicates that, because consumers are unfamiliar with ‘bioengineered,’ limiting the language to only this term fails to adequately inform consumers of the fact that foods are genetically engineered,” the complaint said.                                  Thirdly, the statute requires labels for food made with highly refined genetically engineered ingredients, but USDA has instead excluded products which don’t contain a detectable level of genetically modified material, the lawsuit alleges.                                  Refined beet and cane sugar, high fructose corn syrup and degummed refined vegetable oils made from genetically engineered crops aren’t likely to require labels because the DNA has been eliminated or degraded through processing.                                  “Consumers will see other products disclosed as GE, but not processed foods, and wrongly assume that these foods are not GE foods,” the complaint said.                                  Finally, the plaintiffs argue that USDA’s regulations violate the right to free speech by restricting label language to the “narrow and inadequate forms” mandated by the agency, even though alternative terms are truthful.                                  “To limit speech as it does the rule must be supported by a substantial government interest, but there is no cognizable governmental interest, let alone a substantial one, in prohibiting disclosures on genetically engineered foods beyond the bioengineered classification,” the complaint said.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

During the fourth game against the Beasts, both Conaway and Johnson said the team was tired after a long day of softball in the extreme heat. The players were down 3-1 in the last inning. Knowing if the team lost the game they would have to play a fifth game that afternoon, Chaos was determined to win.
 “The bases were loaded. … We finally just started hitting the ball again, and we just started cranking them. I hit a double, and all of a sudden we were up by I think four. We just went after it even more, and that was game,” Johnson said.
 Chaos won 5-3 for its final game on Saturday.
 On Sunday, the team returned for two more games, both against Purple Haze. The first game was a close one the entire time, and Chaos won by three runs. Johnson credited Chaos’ pitcher.
 “Our pitcher was literally on fire. She just kept wheeling them in there. At the end of the game when the buzzer went off, we came up on top,” Johnson said.
 For the championship game, the Chaos offense kept sending balls to the outfield, and Chaos came out as the champions after defeating the Purple Haze 7-3 in the last game.
 Sharing the win with a couple of her Western teammates meant a lot to Johnson.
 “It means the world to me, actually. Like losing our season with Emma (Key) and Kinsey (Smith) literally broke my heart losing those two. Like that has impacted the game so much for me. It meant the world to me just walking off that field one last time with a win with Kinsey. It just meant a lot to me,” Johnson said.

 AUBURN-Canton Klinedinst Baseball had a great weekend at the Auburn Baseball summer tournament this past weekend. The boys went 2-2 in their division and came away with a runner-up finish in the Silver Bracket.
 Hayden Trigg threw an excellent game one against the Springfield Phillies allowing only four runs over 5 2/3 innings and striking out five.
 Derek Spiva recorded the final out of the game in relief of Trigg. Canton put up 16 runs against the Phillies capped off by a 12-run second inning with every player on the roster contributing to the offense.
 Devin Martin went deep for his third home run of the summer; Gus Lidwell, Parker Roddis, Colin Johnson, and Martin had multiple hits in the game. Dylan Dudek led the base chase by snagging four stolen bags against the Phil's.
 Canton ran into a very solid Collinsville team for game two. The bats fell silent as Canton only had three base runners for the game. Spiva, Dudek and Smith all reached - none were able to cross home and the game ended quietly. Collinsville held on for the win, 12-0. Parker Derenzy and Roddis would share the mound against the opponent; six outs on the arm of Derenzy and three from Roddis.
 Canton rebounded well on a strong pitching performance by Martin in game three against the West Central Elite. Spiva would leadoff the game with a single and then steal second. Dudek singled, plating Spiva.
 Trigg knocked a base hit allowing Dudek to score. Colin Johnson delivered a clutch double allowing Trigg to score.
 Canton was up 3-0 after the first inning.
 The game would go into a pitcher's duel for the next four innings until Johnson would lead off with another double for Canton and be driven in by Martin. Canton won with a final score, 4-1. Martin recorded the win with 6.0 innings pitched and 14 strikeouts; Spiva would lead the offensive production with two hits.
 Next up for the Giants was the Mahomet Mavericks. A hard-fought battle with several ebbs and flows of momentum from Canton to Mahomet and back and forth; a true nail biter that would show some great baseball to the fans and players.
 Pitcher by committee was the order of the day: Roddis, Trigg and Johnson would all toe the rubber in game 4.
 Canton and Mahomet would each plate one in their halves of the first inning. Mahomet capitalized on some defensive miscues by the Giants in the second inning and plated six.
 Your Little Giants would rally back and plate four in the bottom half to narrow the gap; down by two.
 A few spicy moments on the diamond would see a long ball by Johnson, a steal at home by the Mavericks, a double play by Martin and all sorts of fireworks would culminate to a final score of 9-7 Mavericks as the Giants just couldn't catch up and seal the win.
 Your Little Giants were back it Tuesday against Dunlap and will be in action Friday against Peoria Notre Dame.

“It means a lot. Not having high school season was really hard because I grew up with all those girls, and we’ve been playing since we were young, forever. And then being able to play in travel ball with some of the girls that I had been playing with in high school like Izzy (Johnson) and Kinsey (Smith), it was nice to have some high school girls there and winning tournaments … ending our tournaments on a win,” Conaway said.
 The travel league season began in the winter with a slow start, Conaway said, but the lack of a high school season drove the players to work even harder to have a good season.
 “When we first started, we started off really slowly. We were losing games back to back to back. We hadn’t won a game. I didn’t think we were going to be very good when we first started,” Conaway said. “After high school ball, we found out it got canceled. It just like lit a fire inside everyone. We were like, ‘We’re missing that. We just want to play even more.’ So then we started winning even more games.”
 Johnson was a substitute player for Chaos after the team became short a player for the final weekend due to an injury. The team played a total of four games on Saturday, losing the first two pool-play games. After that, the players were determined to perform better, according to her.
 Chaos beat the Elite team for the third game of the day. With several recently-graduated seniors on the team, such as Smith and Jacey Grimm from Lewis Cass High School, Johnson said she and the other underclassmen felt a responsibility to end the day well for the recent graduates who didn’t get a final high school season.
 “Just being able to like play one more last time with them was like, ‘OK, we got to pull through for them at least.’ From then on, we just had our minds set of, ‘We’re going to win this whole thing.’” Johnson said.

Players who are at higher risk can sit out and earn $350K, while players with lower risk can earn $150K. Wick signed to the practice squad late last season and then signed a futures contract in January. Vander Laan signed to the Saints’ practice squad October 23 as an insurance policy while Jared Cook was out with an ankle injury. He earned a promotion to the 53-player roster November 25.Their departures leave the Saints with only four tight ends — Jared Cook, Josh Hill, Adam Trautman, and Garrett Griffin. ",

For history buffs out there, Buffalo mayor Stan Makowski proclaimed July 29th National Chicken Wing Day all the way back in 1977 and, as fate would have it, the rest is history.
 0comments
 A description on NationalChickenWingDay.com, apparently the main lobbyist behind the holiday reads, "Buffalo, New York lays claim to the birthplace of the chicken wing and that's why they are often called Buffalo wings as well. The story goes that Teressa Bellissimo created chicken wings at the Anchor Bar, which she owned with her husband Frank, when her son Dominic and some of his college friends decided they wanted a late night bite to eat. She wanted a fast and easy dish so she deep-fried some chicken wings, which in 1964 were usually reserved for soup stock. She tossed them in butter and hot sauce. Naturally, they were an instant hit. The Bellissimos weren't the first Buffalo restaurateurs to realize the potential of chicken wings. John Young had opened Wings'n Things on Jefferson Avenue in 1963. But his wings were breaded and dressed in a tomato-based sauce."
 It adds, "The Anchor Bar's chicken wing recipe turned out to be irresistible to customers and competitors. Other restaurants in town started catching on. Duff's, in Amherst, started selling them in 1969. A few years later, the City of Buffalo declared July 29 Chicken Wing Day and in its proclamation proudly noted that 'thousands of pounds of chicken wings are consumed by Buffalonians in restaurants and taverns throughout the city each week.'"

The concept of “coronawashing” describes “the biased disclosure of information on the company’s actions developed to address issues related to Covid-19” (Ferrón, 2020). Drawing on earlier notions of CSR-washing, it includes the deployment of solidarity initiatives to change image perception during the crisis. Zatoński _et al._ (2020) provide the example of tobacco companies which “ostentatiously behave like model corporate citizens in their CSR efforts around the coronavirus crisis, [while] behind the scenes they aggressively push back against emergency public health actions to reduce coronavirus transmission.”

Man-for-man, Everton’s current squad seems star-studded compared to their class of 2010/11. And as far as managers go, Ancelotti’s track record in European football trumps David Moyes’ no end.
 The Everton squad of 2010/11 was punctuated by a spread of domestic players who played a pivotal role in first-team affairs.
 Baines, Jagielka, Jermaine Beckford, Neville and Leon Osman were all regulars in Moyes’ side.
 And away from the domestic players, the squad was still packed with Premier League experience in Saha, Tim Howard, Cahill, Arteta and Marouane Fellaini.
 Across the board, Everton had a relatively secure squad but it lacked individualism, which was synonymous with Moyes’ workmanlike sides.

“The purpose of this is to clearly draw a line in the sand acknowledging that, while the borough has sponsored events in the past, they’re relinquishing that now,” Penatzer said. “From this day forward, they’ll no longer be directly involved in the sponsorship or conduct of these events.”                                  Council granted tentative approval to an ordinance establishing a process by which organizations can apply for permits to host parades and other special events. It also approved an operating agreement laying out the new relationship between Ebensburg Borough and the Ebensburg Main Street Partnership, including the level of support to be provided by borough employees and the fee to be paid for that support by the partnership.

By comparison, Everton in its current incarnation is younger and squad has more match-winners, but their downfall has been a lack of solidity and security in midfield.
 While Moyes had Arteta and Osman to anchor, Ancelotti has been tasked with getting the best out of Tom Davies and Andre Gomes in unfamiliar defensive roles.
 In terms of progress, the club has grown in stature. Everton have recently negotiated deals with Barcelona, Juventus, Arsenal and Monaco where in the past they were recruiting players from less well-established clubs.
 To the Toffees’ frustration, though, so have every other Premier League club.
 The division has developed massively on and off the pitch over the past ten years with the influence of coaches such as Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp.
 In 2010/11, Everton’s game-changers were seasoned professionals: Saha, Cahill and Arteta for example. This term, the likes of Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin and Alex Iwobi are all relatively young, Iwobi being the oldest at 24.

Alamance County topped 2,000 COVID-19 cases Monday, July 27, as the local case count makes significant jumps day after day.
   
 Since the first confirmed case reported March 20, the county has seen a total of 2,006 confirmed cases. Two hundred fifty-five of those cases remain active, with 1,710 patients already released from isolation.
   
 "Prior to July 4th we were seeing about 20 [new] cases per day. This week, we're seeing 29 to 30," county Health Director Stacie Saunders said two weeks ago.
   
 In the past week, since July 20, the county has seen an average increase of 40 new cases per day.
   
 The rate of doubling in Alamance has increased to about one month, with case counts doubling from 1,004 on June 24 to 2,006 on July 27. While it took about three months for Alamance to hit 1,000 confirmed cases, it has taken just one month to see the next thousand cases identified.
   
 Travel and increased gatherings are suspected contributors to the rising case counts.
   
 Earlier this month, Saunders said more patients have reported recent travel, whether to popular summer vacation spots, to different parts of the state to see family, or even just to different parts of the county.
   
 Public health officials suspect when residents gather with their families, they are less likely to follow all precautions than when gathering with strangers, she added.
   
 "We're trying to really stress to folks not only when you're out and about around strangers to use the 3 W's, but when you're around your family," Saunders said. "As we're getting together, our friends and families, our neighbors whom we're hanging out with during cookouts or parties, we don't know all the places they've been before they came there."
   
 The three W's are Wear a face mask, Wait six feet apart, and Wash hands or use a hand sanitizer.
   
 As public health officials saw after Memorial Day, household and family clusters in confirmed cases are still evident.
   
 "That has not gone away," Saunders said. "That is a trend that is holding."
   
 The Alamance County Courthouse also reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 Monday. The patient is an employee of an agency with offices inside the courthouse and was last in the courthouse Thursday, July 23.
   
 Officials say this person wore a mask in all common areas and had minimal contact with the public.
   
 "As a precaution, the known location in which this individual appeared will be cleaned and disinfected in accordance with Alamance County Health Department, CDC, and EPA protocols and guidance. All persons who were in these facilities during this timeframe are strongly encouraged to self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19," a statement from the county court district said.
      
 Deaths, outbreaks
   
 As of Monday, 14 people remained hospitalized for care, and 41 deaths (2.04 percent of the total case count) have been reported.
   
 Two of the county's three long-term care facility outbreaks have been mitigated, Saunders said, White Oak Manor in Burlington and Peak Resources in Graham. An outbreak is considered mitigated when the facility goes through two incubation periods without any new cases, she explained. Peak Resources' outbreak was mitigated at the end of June, while White Oak Manor's outbreak was mitigated last week.
   
 The third outbreak, at Brookdale Senior Living in Burlington, affected one resident and two staff members, neither of whom are Alamance County residents.
   
 Testing numbers, availability
   
 More testing locations are opening up in the county, Saunders said, and increased access to testing will reveal higher case count numbers.
   
 Testing sites in Alamance County include the Health Department, Piedmont Health Services, the Grand Oaks Center at Alamance Regional Medical Center, Kernodle Clinic West, FastMed Urgent Care, NextCare Urgent Care, and the CVS Pharmacy on West Webb Avenue.
   
 The Health Department also has partnered with Cone Health to host mobile testing sites throughout the county. Testing at these sites, advertised on county social media accounts, is free. Those who want to be tested should bring photo IDs, face masks and their insurance cards if they have them. No appointments are needed, but tests are offered on a first come, first served basis.
   
 Testing data have been added also to the Health Department's weekly report, though Saunders said there is a delay to allow a full week's worth of collection results to be published.
   
 In Alamance County, 2,605 tests were collected the week of July 11, with 8.8 percent testing positive. The county has hovered around 9 percent of tests resulting positive since late June.
   
 Statewide numbers
   
 Neighboring counties are seeing higher case counts as well. As of Monday, Guilford County had reported 4,789 cases with 139 deaths (2.9 percent), while Orange County had reported 1,219 cases with 45 deaths (3.7 percent). Chatham and Caswell counties are reporting 1,181 and 173 cases, respectively, with 49 deaths reported in Chatham County (4.1 percent) and two deaths in Caswell County (1.1 percent).
   
 On Monday, the state reported 114,338 people had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, with 1,790 deaths (1.56 percent) reported statewide. Of the 1,635,476 tests completed in the state, about 6.9 percent of people had tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday. One thousand one hundred sixty-nine people were hospitalized statewide Monday.
   
 All of North Carolina's 100 counties are seeing cases of COVID-19.

PARIS -- Olivia de Havilland, the doe-eyed actress beloved to millions as the sainted Melanie Wilkes of "Gone With the Wind," but also a two-time Oscar winner and an off-screen fighter who challenged and unchained Hollywood's contract system, died Sunday at her home in Paris. She was 104.                                               Havilland, the sister of fellow Oscar winner Joan Fontaine, died peacefully of natural causes, said New York-based publicist Lisa Goldberg.                                               De Havilland was among the last of the top screen performers from the studio era, and the last surviving lead from "Gone With the Wind," an irony, she once noted, since the fragile, self-sacrificing Wilkes was the only major character to die in the film. The 1939 epic, based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling Civil War novel and winner of 10 Academy Awards, is often ranked as Hollywood's box office champion (adjusting for inflation), although it is now widely condemned for its glorified portrait of slavery and antebellum life.                                               The pinnacle of producer David O. Selznick's career, the movie had a troubled off-screen story.                                               Three directors worked on the film, stars Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable were far more connected on screen than off and the fourth featured performer, Leslie Howard, was openly indifferent to the role of Ashley Wilkes, Melanie's husband. But de Havilland remembered the movie as "one of the happiest experiences I've ever had in my life. It was doing something I wanted to do, playing a character I loved and liked."                                               During a career that spanned six decades, de Havilland also took on roles ranging from an unwed mother to a psychiatric inmate in "The Snake Pit," a personal favorite. The dark-haired De Havilland projected both a gentle, glowing warmth and a sense of resilience and mischief that made her uncommonly appealing, leading critic James Agee to confess he was "vulnerable to Olivia de Havilland in every part of my being except the ulnar nerve."                                               She was Errol Flynn's co-star in a series of dramas, Westerns and period pieces, most memorably as Maid Marian in "The Adventures of Robin Hood." But De Havilland also was a prototype for an actress too beautiful for her own good, typecast in sweet and romantic roles while desiring greater challenges.                                               Her frustration finally led her to sue Warner Bros. in 1943 when the studio tried to keep her under contract after it had expired, claiming she owed six more months because she had been suspended for refusing roles. Her friend Bette Davis was among those who had failed to get out of her contract under similar conditions in the 1930s, but de Havilland prevailed, with the California Court of Appeals ruling that no studio could extend an agreement without the performer's consent.                                               She is survived by her daughter, Gisele Galante Chulack, her son-in-law Andrew Chulack and her niece Deborah Dozier Potter.                              *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

AUBURN-Canton Klinedinst Baseball had a great weekend at the Auburn Baseball summer tournament this past weekend. The boys went 2-2 in their division and came away with a runner-up finish in the Silver Bracket.
   
 Hayden Trigg threw an excellent game one against the Springfield Phillies allowing only four runs over 5 2/3 innings and striking out five.
   
 Derek Spiva recorded the final out of the game in relief of Trigg. Canton put up 16 runs against the Phillies capped off by a 12-run second inning with every player on the roster contributing to the offense.
   
 Devin Martin went deep for his third home run of the summer; Gus Lidwell, Parker Roddis, Colin Johnson, and Martin had multiple hits in the game. Dylan Dudek led the base chase by snagging four stolen bags against the Phil's.
   
 Canton ran into a very solid Collinsville team for game two. The bats fell silent as Canton only had three base runners for the game. Spiva, Dudek and Smith all reached - none were able to cross home and the game ended quietly. Collinsville held on for the win, 12-0.  Parker Derenzy and Roddis would share the mound against the opponent; six outs on the arm of Derenzy and three from Roddis.
   
 Canton rebounded well on a strong pitching performance by Martin in game three against the West Central Elite. Spiva would leadoff the game with a single and then steal second. Dudek singled, plating Spiva.
   
 Trigg knocked a base hit allowing Dudek to score. Colin Johnson delivered a clutch double allowing Trigg to score.
   
 Canton was up 3-0 after the first inning.
   
 The game would go into a pitcher's duel for the next four innings until Johnson would lead off with another double for Canton and be driven in by Martin. Canton won with a final score, 4-1. Martin recorded the win with 6.0 innings pitched and 14 strikeouts; Spiva would lead the offensive production with two hits.
   
 Next up for the Giants was the Mahomet Mavericks. A hard-fought battle with several ebbs and flows of momentum from Canton to Mahomet and back and forth; a true nail biter that would show some great baseball to the fans and players.
   
 Pitcher by committee was the order of the day: Roddis, Trigg and Johnson would all toe the rubber in game 4.
   
 Canton and Mahomet would each plate one in their halves of the first inning. Mahomet capitalized on some defensive miscues by the Giants in the second inning and plated six.
   
 Your Little Giants would rally back and plate four in the bottom half to narrow the gap; down by two.
   
 A few spicy moments on the diamond would see a long ball by Johnson, a steal at home by the Mavericks, a double play by Martin and all sorts of fireworks would culminate to a final score of 9-7 Mavericks as the Giants just couldn't catch up and seal the win.
   
 Your Little Giants were back it Tuesday against Dunlap and will be in action Friday against Peoria Notre Dame.

West Indies captain Jason Holder feels "relevant" authorities need to ensure that smaller teams get to play regular international cricket as in a world scarred by Covid-19, only India, Australia and England have the resources to stage games in bio-secure bubbles. The cricketing fraternity has lauded the West Indies' decision to tour England amid the pandemic. The three Test-series, which England won 2-1 on Tuesday, marked resumption of international cricket. The series was played in a bio-secure environment increasing organisational costs significantly and Holder said teams like the West Indies are likely to struggle to create a similar environment.Also Read | Pathan asks valid question after Kohli's photo on top of a tree goes viral "If something doesn't happen soon we'll see less international cricket being played by smaller countries because we simply can't afford it. We've gone from having four, five-match series, down to two and three," Holder said after the conclusion of the third Test here. "And it's very difficult to host any more than that for us, particularly the Caribbean. So yeah, it is a serious dilemma that we're faced with. I think the relevant personnel really need to sit down and have a look at it," he added. The West Indies were confined to just two venues -- Manchester and Southampton -- during the eight-week tour. Both teams stayed on site. Holder hopes that England too will reciprocate their gesture and tour the Caribbean soon. "We only really make money from England, and I think India. We break even with Pakistan and Australia, and all the rest of the series we play are losses. But in these trying times only England, Australia and India can probably host cricket," he said. "Outside of that, the smaller territories are struggling financially to get cricket on...if there's an opportunity for England to come over to the Caribbean before the end of the year, I'm sure that would help significantly for Cricket West Indies' financial records." The West Indies players and staff have had to take pay cuts due to the financial impact of Covid-19 on their board. "It's been a tough couple of years in West Indies cricket financially. We've pretty much had to take a pay cut, so if it's possible to host a tour before the end of 2020, it would probably keep us afloat as an organisation," Holder said when asked about the current situation. Despite the challenges posed by this tour, Holder said it was enjoyable. "I've thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It's the first time I've had the opportunity to mingle with, more or less, the A-team players, because I haven't played much first-class cricket in the last couple of years."I'm not sure right now if Cricket West Indies could afford to have an academy, or something similar to Loughborough here in England, but that is definitely something that would help CWI," he added.

Sommers reported that the Optum site currently averages 150 tests a day. Last Friday, 156 people were tested.
 According to Sommers, the local health department is on track to take over the testing center.
 “We’re actually ahead of the curve in terms of planning for the center,” Sommers said. “We need to keep the momentum with testing up, so we hope to open as soon as we can.”
 Sommers and the Howard County Health Department have been working with both the county and state to secure funding and resources to open the center. It will cost around $100,000 to operate the new site for a 10-month period. The site will be funded largely by state and local grants.
 The new site is required to be open at least 35 hours a week, for at least two evenings a week and on Saturdays to receive the funding.

A grandson of Singapore's founding leader Lee Kuan Yew and nephew of the current prime minister was convicted Wednesday of contempt of court over a Facebook post criticising the judiciary during a bitter family feud.                                  Li Shengwu, an academic at Harvard University, was also fined Sg$15,000 ($11,000) by the High Court over the 2017 post in which he described the Singapore government as "very litigious and has a pliant court system".                                  He will have to serve a week's jail if he does not pay, Justice Kannan Ramesh said in the judgement, although Li is currently living in the United States.                                  Li is the eldest son of business executive Lee Hsien Yang, who has been at loggerheads with his brother, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, over their father's legacy.                                  He made the Facebook post as the family feud raged publicly following the death of the Lee patriarch in 2015. The spat pitted his father and aunt against his prime minister uncle.                                  The Attorney-General's Chambers had described his post as "an egregious and baseless attack on the Singapore Judiciary" and lodged contempt proceedings against him.                                  Li initially took part in the proceedings through his lawyers, but withdrew later.                                  "I disagree with the judgement," Li said in a Facebook post Wednesday after learning about the court's decision.                                  He said he was worried that the verdict would reinforce the ruling People's Action Party's "tendency to suppress ordinary political speech" in the city-state.                                  The PAP was returned to power in elections earlier this month although with a sharply reduced share of the popular vote and with the opposition gaining more seats in parliament.                                  Li's father Lee Hsien Yang joined an opposition party before the polls and campaigned for its candidates although he did not run.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The theory of the voter's illusion describes checking a ballot box as an exercise in altruism [source: Munsey]. Consequently, what drives people to the polls isn't so much a desire to benefit a candidate, party or issue, but rather to keep a civic ripple effect going and thus benefit the entire nation. Like sports fans doing "the wave" in a stadium, active voters supposedly inspire those around them to follow suit. And just as a solo fan might not want to look like a spoilsport by refusing to hop up and flap his arms in the air, voting is also a way of fitting in with a national identity and dodging societal guilt heaped on non-voters who aren't proudly flaunting "I Voted" stickers. In other words, people vote because it looks good, and it makes them feel good.

We are always at threat for the next pandemic. These viruses exist out in nature. As people go out in nature they get infected and then move their way back into humans. If we were to imagine the origins of covid-19 as a movie, it would begin at the end of the contagion movie. Exactly that process of bulldozing down the forest, bats flying off infecting livestock that then we get infected. That happens every day, every week. That's how these things begin. With you Wuhan is a major hub on the wildlife trade pathway. It's close to hot spot areas for new coronaviruses. Ever since the covid pandemic hit, we've been trying to determine if anybody knew anything about a contagion sweeping through Wuhan last fall and when did they know it. Researchers looked at satellite photos of Wuhan hospitals in October of 2019. And what they show are packed parking lots. All those red dots are cars. And we took those photos and we put 'em next to October of 2018. Mirror images. And you can clearly see in some cases there are 50% to 90% more cars. That shows that those hospitals were busy during this time. Then they found another clue when they looked at baidu, that's the Google search engine for China. During this time, there was an increase in searches for terms like "Cough" and "Diarrhea," two symptoms of covid-19. Now, this is three months before China announces that they have a problem with the coronavirus. Clearly, something was happening in Wuhan. On the 29th of October, we flew to Wuhan to start the river part of the cruise on the yangtze. We were very excited. We had not ever been to Wuhan. At the time, it seemed weird. The treatment of us, on this particular city, was different than other cities we'd been in on this tour. We're lined up to get onto the ship. They really emphasized, "Stay in line. You don't have time to go wander anywhere." And once we were on the ship, nobody was allowed to get off. Having 150 western tourists from the uk, Australia, Canada, United States get sick and trace back to Wuhan might have not been a good idea. We were immediately told that we would be leaving and -- bing, bang, boom. We were gone. 3, 2, 1, happy new ar! So I was at home with my wife and a couple of friends. We were cooking a dinner and celebrating the new year's. I was snuggled on the couch with my sons watching the ball drop in New York. They say close to a million and a half people gathered here tonight. It was the first time, in a long time, that I had an opportunity to get my whole family back together. And I did get a phone call from my colleagues at CDC, that there was a mysterious new pneumonia that appeared not to be flu. We have a brand new virus that's jumped species from an animal to a human. And immediately, that was an alarm bell. It was clear the threat was real. The threat was serious. But on new year's eve, if someone had told me a pandemic was coming, that wouldn't have surprised me. The world was overdue for one. And that's what's always kept me up at night. It is the perfect storm, and my worst nightmare. At the end of 2019 into 2020, the trump white house wasn't focused on a global pandemic. But frankly, nobody was in Washington. We do have breaking news tonight, president trump has just been impeached. First of all, the president had just been impeached. We were going into an impeachment trial. Quite frankly, we were focused on Iran that first week. The stunning sight, millions of Iranians taking to the streets demanding revenge for the killing of their top military leader. There is a lot going on that is consuming all attention, the president's attention, the Democrats' attention in congress, the military's attention -- beyond a global pandemic. Chinese health authorities are still working to identify the virus behind a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of There were reports of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China and they were images of people in hazmat suits spraying down a seafood market. It kind of gave me a bit of a chill. Reading about people being locked into apartment buildings, streets being closed off, entire streets being cord onned. That is a signal of how serious this pathogen was. Happy new year. Happy new year. We're going to have a great year. As we ring in the new year, president trump is in Florida at mar-a-lago. When we wrote up our first situation report on January 1st, I had my first meetings to discuss this with the national security council on January 2nd. What's not publicly known is that behind the scenes, in the presidential daily brief, there's information being put in telling the president that there's something strange happening in the Wuhan region of China. We felt that this had potential to be a very serious situation that had national security implications. Dr. Redfield at the CDC, he's on the phone with Dr. Fauci. It was ding, bing, back and forth. Both of us agreed that this looks, smells, and almost certainly is a new coronavirus. And the question is what are we going to do about it. Is this a pathogen that goes from animals to humans, or is this a pathogen that went from human to human? Bob was trying to get information in real time exactly what was going on over there. The frustration is that he wanted to get his team there and to go to Wuhan and find out what was going on. But the Chinese were not allowing that. I had strongly suggested that we send some CDC folks in to help out. And the president actually made the request to the president of China that we be able to come and assist. And the Chinese are stonewalling. They're not letting them have access to the key sites. We had literally, you know, 20, 30 people ready to go. The fact that they were not allowed to go there in realtime and see what was going on was very disconcerting to us. So on January 8th, the CDC issues its first health alert connected to the pandemic. And president trump heads to Ohio, where he holds this big rally. Make America great again. No, the president didn't publicly predict any danger. And America's future has never ever looked brighter, ever. In early January, China hasn't released the genome, or the genetic map of the virus. You need the genome of the virus to develop tests and drugs and vaccines, and there were significant delays in sharing it with the world. On January 12th, the Chinese government, after resisting American requests for information, releases the genetic sequence of the virus. All right, all hands on deck. We gotta make a vaccine 'cause we don't know where this is going. There's a lot of unknowns. It was just a matter of time before it arrived in the united States. To think otherwise would be completely naive.                     *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Adds minister comment, details)
 ATHENS, July 28 (Reuters) - Greece will make mask-wearing compulsory at more indoor public spaces to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus after a small flare-up of COVID-19 infections in the second half of this month, its Deputy Civil Protection Minister said on Tuesday.
 Health authorities made mask-wearing mandatory for consumers at supermarkets 10 days ago. Masks must also be worn on public transport.
 The new measures come into effect from Wednesday and will require masks to be worn by everyone inside retail shops, offices, banks, food stores and bakeries. Churches are excluded for the time being.
 "The rise in infections in Athens and Thessaloniki proves the virus is still here. The requirement is for the collective good. The situation must not cause panic but neither complacency," Nikos Hardalias said.
 Greece's health minister said last week the country was not facing a second wave of infections but needs to remain vigilant.
 Greece has managed to contain the spread of COVID-19 infections to 4,227 confirmed cases and 202 deaths up to Monday after imposing an early lockdown.
 "We must not let any room for things to go wrong," Hardalias said. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos, editing by Ed Osmond)

“A newly defined Exploration Target for Colomac suggests that up to 1.5 Moz Au with grades between 1.8 gpt Au and 2.0 gpt Au could be added to the current resource. We believe this can be achieved with anywhere from 50,000 to 75,000 metres of additional drilling, of which we plan to complete upwards of 25,000 metres this year with drilling already well underway. Furthermore, with limited drilling information available with respect to the recently discovered widening of the mineralized portion of the Colomac Main sill and especially in light of the sill’s expansion to upwards of 155 metres in true width at approximately 750 metres depth at Zone 1.5, this tremendous prospect was not captured in the current resource estimate. There remains significant upside to build additional ounces, over and above the Exploration Target within the vastly unexplored portions of the host quartz diorite. Given these strategic prospects we anticipate rapid resource growth in addition to the outlined Exploration Target areas.                                                      *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

SHEFFIELD — David Johnson said his love for Sheffield, plus his lifelong work based on community relations, is a combination that will benefit the city if he is elected mayor.
 Johnson, 70, is hoping to fill the seat being vacated by Ian Sanford, who is not seeking re-election.
 Municipal elections are Aug. 25.
 Johnson, a native of Sheffield, worked in the music recording industry from his Sheffield base for 21 years. He also served 21 years as director of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame from its construction to operation.
 The past 10 years he has operated David Johnson Productions, specializing in music event presentations.
 In addition to his work in the music industry, Johnson served from 1980 to 1989 on the Sheffield Commission, during which time he said he was involved in bringing many businesses into the city, and was responsible for getting city employees into the State Retirement System.
 Appointed by two different governors to the Alabama Music Hall of Fame board, Johnson has served as president of the Alabama Mountain Lakes Tourism Board, the Southeast Tourism Society board, the Sheffield Utilities board and the Northwest-Shoals Community College Foundation Board.
 He said he'll continue pursuing businesses to locate in Sheffield with the same fervor, but added, "first, we need to clean up Sheffield.
 "We can't ask people to come to Sheffield and locate their businesses here when it doesn't look great," he said. "There are spotty areas around town in need of cleanup, and we need to do that and take pride in our clean city so it will be beneficial to us all."
 Johnson said the downtown growth that has been a point of pride in recent years has to continue and spread outward.
 "With downtown continuously being renovated and the possibility of Inspiration Landing, Sheffield could be the center of the Shoals beyond its geographics," he said.
 Johnson said he'll put his strong local and state governmental ties to work for the city.
 "Working with local organizations and small businesses, I have worked on initiatives that directly affect economic development, tourism and recognition both state and nationally," he said. "I have the knowledge and proven success with securing grants and funding, and have good rapport with governmental agencies."
 He said he recalls 10 years ago seeking (real estate developers) Rodney and Laquita Logan's sponsorship for Sheffield's first street party.
 He said Shoals area businessman Danny Hardeman was already renovating buildings and taking an interest in Sheffield properties, and he approached the Logans about doing so as well.
 "After that introduction to downtown, the Logans really got involved with the (revitalization of) Sheffield," Johnson said. "We need to find more people like this."
 For Johnson the possibilities are limitless for the city he loves.
 "I know how to find opportunities for our city and seize them."

The Red Sox, despite an electric lineup – yes, I said that! – have no chance against even the Baltimore Orioles using starters being paid the veteran minimum.
 And while the names Josh Taylor (starter) and Darwinzon Hernandez (lefty specialist) aren't going to scare anybody, they're absence due to COVID-19 means two pitchers on the roster wouldn't/shouldn't be there.
 Sox Baseball Ops president Chaim Bloom did not even attempt to replace Sale or Price, despite having ample time.
 This is a “gap” year for Bloom. He was not ready to blow things up as we first thought. He basically has allowed the Red Sox to be the Red Sox, which over the last two decades has wavered between champs and dysfunction.
 The only player the Red Sox could not afford to lose is Rodriguez. He is the ace. And there is not even a guy on this staff, as a potential starter, that is even half as good.
 His elite, seven innings of Cy Young stuff are gone and won’t be replaced any time soon.
 Godley’s resume is interesting. He had one very good year in 2018, going 15-11 with a semi-hefty 4.74 ERA while striking out one batter per inning.
 The rest of his career is 32-29; hardly a savior.
 But the Red Sox don’t need a savior just yet. They need a starter who can pitch four or five innings and allow this offense to take control.
 The Red Sox bullpen is pretty good, we think. But you need a lead or close game in the sixth or seventh inning to show their stuff.
 I get it. This doesn’t look good, particularly this early to be flipping coins on which no-name is starting tonight.
 On Wednesday, Eovaldi, who looked like his old self in the opener, is back on the mound versus the Mets in Queens, N.Y.
 Unfortunately for him, losing is out of the question. As crazy as this sounds, the Red Sox season hinges on him saving this sinking ship.
 "Obviously we have to get better pitching," said Roenicke. "But I think the pitching will get better."
 As for Godley’s next gig, as a starter, the Red Sox need a decent five innings allowing two or three runs. Or else.

With _The Princess and the Frog_ , the fan-favorite movie that has long been all-but-invisible at Disney Parks, taking over the theming of the beloved Splash Mountain log flume ride at Disneyland and Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, the film's star hopes to see Tiana's Palace, the character's restaurant from the end of the film, incorporated into the area. Anika Noni Rose said in an interview with People that she expects the ride to be Mardi Gras themed, with music, fun, and a little bit of fright. But she also thinks it would be a missed opportunity not to incorporate food.
 The decision to re-theme Splash Mountain came earlier this year. After years of being lobbied by a small but dedicated number of fans to remove the ride's _Song of the South_ characters and theming -- the film contains numerous racist caricatures of Black people and has been all but disavowed by Disney, with no official release in decades -- the company finally made the move after the death of George Floyd sparked a nationwide conversation about how pervasive racism is in everyday American life.
 Along with removals or re-examinations of monuments to Confederate soldiers and blackface performances in film and TV, Disney announced that they would be embracing a suggestion to re-theme Splash Mountain with _Song of the South_ characters replaced by _The Princess and the Frog_ , the movie that featured Disney's first Black princess. A press release issued when Disney made the decision public claimed that it had been in the works for a year -- which, as stated, is possible, since they have been hearing similar requests for quite some time.
 The ride's storyline will pick up "after the final kiss, and join[s] Princess Tiana and Louis on a musical adventure -- featuring some of the powerful music from the film -- as they prepare for their first-ever Mardi Gras performance."
 Louis, for those who might not remember, is a horn-playing alligator who appeared in the movie and will seemingly serve as the ride's musical guide.
 "Anytime you talk about Mardi Gras, the music has to be fantastic," Rose told _People_. "I'm hoping Louis will get to play and make us laugh. It should be a little thrilling, but it also should be just a whole lot of fun."

 Given the Princess branding and its importance to Disney, it would not be surprising to see them embrace the "Palace" setting, although how it would play into the ride (or IF it would -- even if they decided to use it, they could just make it a nearby restaurant) is anybody's guess.
 There's something of an irony built into the challenge of re-theming the popular Splash Mountain attraction; before the ride was opened in 1989, then- CEO Michael Eisner, who had already started distancing the company from _Song of the South_ , didn't like the original, planned name (the Zip-A-Dee River Run) and wanted to tie the ride to _Splash_ , the hugely successful 1984 film in which Tom Hanks falls in love with a mermaid played by Daryl Hannah. Eisner's note was mostly ignored, except for the name change, but it seems likely that the Zip-A-Dee name and the more explicit ties to _Song of the South_ might have hastened changes to the ride. On the other hand, if they had more fully embraced _Splash_ , it likely would have been changed much sooner, since while the film remains loved by many, it's hardly thought of in the same way that DC's animated classics are.

LONDON, July 28 (Reuters) - Britain is looking at setting quarantine rules for different regions within countries overseas, but will continue to make decisions on a country-wide basis for now, junior transport minister Charlotte Vere said on Tuesday.
 "For the time being we are taking the approach by country for border measures, but it is the case that it could be that we could put them in place for regions in the future," she told the House of Lords. "We are not there yet but we are certainly looking at it."

Such an example raises the question of what's to be done when an injustice is committed. Over the years, many black people have asked the government to make restitution for the years of unequal treatment that their ancestors received. When any crime or abuse is committed, we want justice, both for the offender and for the victim. For the offender, justice means that crimes don't go unpunished, but also that the punishment fits the crime. We treat a 13-year- old who stole a pack of gum differently than we treat a grown man who commits homicide, so justice has some flexibility in its administration. For a victim, justice may be seeing a criminal put behind bars, or it may be monetary -- the goal is to make the victim feel equal again.
