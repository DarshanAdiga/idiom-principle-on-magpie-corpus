“We had to reduce our operational hours just to keep operational costs down. We tried to critique our open hours,” Cox said. “But what we had to do was scale it back, just to try to cover the high volume foot traffic time frame, while reducing hours. And that’s what we had to do, basically, to keep the doors open. We had to make cuts everywhere we could to try to skimp and keep things running at the lowest costs we could, just to keep things afloat. I’m proud to say, we didn’t have to close. We didn’t lose any employees, and we’ve maintained the same staffing level. We really pulled through. It just took the effort of everybody here. I mean all of us had to make some sacrifices.”
 According to Cox, Moe Joe’s took a hit in business when the downtown coffee shop lost indoor seating, particularly on weekends. Moe Joe’s lost the ability to have its regular Friday live music, and customers no longer were able to sit inside and work on their laptops, both of which drew in customers.
 However, Moe Joe’s coffee saw a jump in gift card sales. According to Cox, several area banks purchased gift cards from Moe Joe’s and gifted them to their own customers. Cox said that during the initial 90-day period of the shutdown, Moe Joe’s sold more gift cards then than it had since the store opened in April 2018.
 Though most restrictions have lifted, Cox said that he still sees a direct correlation between foot traffic and new announcements from the state regarding COVID-19.
 “As these news releases come out, it kind of dictates how it’s going to be for the week,” Cox said. “When there’s an announcement on Monday from the governor that says this restriction will happen, we’ll take a small dip. But it seems by Thursday we’re back to being full speed or better. As news comes out, it kind of dictates the flow of business.”
 Although Moe Joe’s is still operating on reduced hours, Cox remained optimistic that, as fall approaches, the store will continue to see a rise in traffic.
 “I think by Thanksgiving we’ll be back to full speed,” Cox said. “In this business, when you have the fall drinks, the pumpkins, the spice lattes and stuff, a lot of people get into that type of thing. I think fall is a huge advantage for us because it’s such a busy time in the business.”
 Currently, Indiana remains in Stage 4.5, which allows for restaurants to operate at 75-percent capacity, bars and nightclubs at 50-percent capacity, and movie theaters and other entertainment venues at 50-percent capacity. Stage 4.5 is slated to end on Sept. 25.

The addition was seen as an escape clause, avoiding any impression that Mandela was goading the court to impose the death penalty.

Graham’s evolving position on drilling has been a focal point for opponents, eager to portray the three-term senator, a frequent golfing partner of the president’s, as malleable to his influence. After the Trump administration’s 2017 announcement of a five-year plan to open 90% of the nation’s offshore reserves to private development, Graham said “there are ways to drill offshore that would not hurt tourism” — a $24 billion South Carolina industry — adding since then that he felt states should be able to opt out or in before drilling occurred.
 A PAC supporting Graham’s Democratic opponent, Jaime Harrison, has seized on drilling to try to erode support for Graham in the conservative-leaning state. The day before Trump’s announcement, as thousands of visitors flocked to South Carolina’s beaches for Labor Day, the Lindsey Must Go PAC flew a banner plane with the message “L. Graham Wants to Drill 4 Oil Here.” It also launched a digital ad highlighting Graham’s purported support of drilling expansion and ties to the oil industry.
 It’s a line of attack that has proven successful before, albeit on a smaller scale. In 2018, Democrat Joe Cunningham became the first Democrat to flip a South Carolina seat from red to blue in decades, in part by seizing on Republican Katie Arrington’s support for Trump’s drilling proposal.
 The political dynamic is similar in Georgia, where — due to the retirement of longtime Sen. Johnny Isakson at the end of 2019 — both of the state’s Republican senators are on the ballot.

According to the video’s creators, Jordan Grainger and Brian West, the idea for the video came about after they were discussing the “rose-colored glasses kind of viewpoint” that, in their eyes, the citizens of Kokomo have, particularly in regards to the opioid epidemic.
 “The whole idea behind it was we wanted to create something with a tone of positivity but about a subject matter that was dark and negative,” Grainger said. “But we’re also watching every day as our citizens in this town are overdosing left and right. And the other half of the citizens are voting against a rehabilitation center and policies that would actually help curve the opioid crisis and the methamphetamine crisis. The subject matter and the tone that we conveyed were on completely different levels and sides of the coin in order to bring awareness and shed light on what we think is an issue that a lot of people are overlooking.”
 While they both defended the video as satire, both Grainger and West said that they wished they would have contacted a local organization that assists those battling substance abuse to provide an opportunity for substance abuse education after the video.
 The video was removed by Facebook. Since posting the video, the moderators of Kokomo Press have posted links promoting Steps to Success, a program that works to assist those fighting addiction.
 The video was published two months after Howard County experienced the highest number of overdose deaths in recent years, with 15 deaths from April 1 to June 20. To date, twenty-four people have died from overdoses in Howard County this year.

CHICAGO -- With the wind blowing in from center at Wrigley Field on Tuesday, the name of the game was line drives. The ivy-covered walls must've seemed 500 feet away with the way fly balls died in the outfield.
   
 That spelled bad news for a Cincinnati Reds offense that has relied on home runs for much of its run production. At a time when every game carries extra weight as the Reds try to stay afloat in the postseason race, the Reds were shut out for the sixth time this season in a 3-0 loss to the Chicago Cubs.
   
 The Reds are six games under .500 with 18 games remaining in their season and they have the fourth-worst record in the National League. Those playoff dreams are quickly fading away. They dropped to 3.5 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals for second place in the division (an automatic playoff spot) and three games back in the wild-card race.
   
 "These are all must-win games and when you lose, it kills you," Reds starter Tyler Mahle said. "All we can do is find out what we did wrong and move forward and look to tomorrow to come out and win."
   
 Including Sunday's 3-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Reds haven't scored in 15 consecutive innings. The Reds have an 0-15 record when they score fewer than three runs; an 18-9 record when they score at least three runs.
   
 The lack of offense spoiled another strong start from Mahle, who should be a lock for the starting rotation in 2021. Mahle allowed three runs on four hits and one walk in seven innings, but he was disappointed in himself.
   
 With two runners on base and two outs in the second inning, David Bote thumped a line drive into right field that flew over the head of Nick Castellanos for a two-run triple. Castellanos, who was playing shallow, was spun around by the line drive and never had a real chance to catch it.
   
 "Really hard-hit ball right at him and you make one wrong reaction and before you know the balls over your head," Reds manager David Bell said.
   
 In the third inning, it was Javier Baez's turn. Kris Bryant was on first base after he was hit by a pitch and Baez lined a fastball into the right-field corner that Castellanos couldn't run down for an RBI triple.
   
 Both run-scoring triples were two-strike pitches with two outs. Bote connected on a 95-mph inside fastball that was above the strike zone.
   
 "I was trying to go up-and-away," Mahle said. "It ended up being up-and-in. If you're trying to go up-and-away and the ball runs in, it's just not as good of a pitch as if you were trying to go in. Not only did I miss, but I wasn't fully convicted in that pitch.
   
 "I kind of wanted to go up-and-in. The ball ended up being there, but I tried to throw it up-and-away. Bad things always happen when you do that. So, I shook yes to an up-and-away fastball and he hit it. Those two runs are 100% why I said I'm disappointed in myself."
   
 Mahle retired 13 of the next 14 batters after Baez's triple. He pitched well enough to keep the Reds in the game, striking out 10. He drew an impressive 15 swings and misses with his fastball, which topped out at 96.4 mph.
   
 With the wind blowing in, he felt like he could "get away with some things." Baez barreled a slider in the sixth inning that would've flown to Waveland Avenue on most nights, but it died on the warning track.
   
 "I don't know that I've ever really seen a starter really consistently just gets stronger as the game goes on like he does," Bell said. "He's going to get some complete games in his career and that's pretty rare these days, so it's just really impressive how he continues to get better."
   
 In Mahle's last three starts, he yielded eight runs and 10 hits in 20 2/3 innings (3.48 ERA). He was supposed to be on the outside of the starting rotation at the beginning of the season, but he's made it difficult for the Reds not to give him the ball every fifth day.
   
 "I don't think I've had a stretch of games like this," Mahle said. "I don't think I have put together three quality starts in a row, it feels like. Definitely, it's a confidence booster."
   
 The Reds didn't have a runner touch third base against right-hander Alec Mills and the Cubs bullpen. Mills had allowed at least three runs in each of his last five starts prior to Tuesday, but the Reds produced just four hits against him in six innings.
   
 The fifth inning was a turning point. Shogo Akiyama lined a leadoff single to left field, but rookie Jose Garcia grounded into a double play on the next pitch. Tucker Barnhart tried to restart the rally with a double into right field and Joey Votto followed with a walk.
   
 The Cubs had Ryan Tepera warming up in the bullpen, so Mills was on the ropes. Then Mills struck out Castellanos on three pitches - all sliders that swept off the plate. Catcher Willson Contreras pumped his fist when Castellanos offered a check swing on strike three. Mills pounded his right hand into his glove as he walked off the mound.
   
 "When you don't score any runs, you definitely look at what we could have done different," Bell said. "I don't want to take anything away from (Mills) because I think he pitched a good game, but we'll definitely evaluate that and then see what we could have done different."
   
 The Reds will have to win 12 of their final 18 games to finish the season with a .500 record. They entered the year with playoff-or-bust expectations and, well, their hopes of making the playoffs are on life support.
   
 "Within the next 10 games, teams will be starting clinching playoff spots and I know that," Akiyama said through translator Luke Shinoda, "but as of now, I just want to focus on each game."

On the other sideline, North Vermillion head coach Brian Crabtree has a squad that lost ten days of practice this fall and who still have several starters who cannot play due to having insufficient practices.
 The veteran coach has had to cobble together a team from whomever is available – including three freshmen in the defensive backfield – and depend on the solid foundation he and his staff have built at the school to do the best they can.
 There is no doubt that Crabtree has the team motivated, but their inexperience, lack of practice time and inability to do conditioning due to having to spend so much time teaching makes it tough going for the Falcons.
 “It doesn’t matter whether we’re 15-0 or struggling, the values are the same,” he said in describing the North Vermillion program. “We call these life lessons. When life is tough, you get up and go to work and it will pay off down the road.”
 Crabtree continued, “Right now we’re a couple of weeks behind. We’re working on fixing things in week three that we normally would have fixed in week one, but we’re getting better and we’re going to win some games this year.”
 North Vermillion opened the game with the ball, but went three-and-out and punted.
 Covington then drove 62 yards in five plays, keyed by an opening 41-yard pass and catch from quarterback Alan Karrfalt to Asa Hohenstein, to put six points on the board as the two-point try failed.
 It was not until the second quarter that anyone scored again, and it was North Vermillion who put six points on the scoreboard after a 12-play drive capped off by a five-yard touchdown run by Carter Edney.
 Last season, the only “misses” on extra points by McKenzie Crowder were against Covington when her line let defenders through to block two kicks and her bad luck against the Trojans continued when the snap on thi9s extra point try was off the mark and the kick never took place, leaving the score 6-6.
 Covington came right back with a seven-play drive with Karrfalt connecting on passes to Hohenstein, Neil Ellmore and Dane Gerling before running the final nine yards to put the Trojans up 12-6 when the two-point try came up short.
 North Vermillion responded by running Cody Tryon for ten yards and then having Edney keep the ball for four runs before he threw to Eli Peaslee for a 30-yard gain.

Howard County has moved to "yellow" across the board in the Indiana State Department of Health's newly-implemented scoring system that aims to track the change in COVID-19 community spread by scoring counties either blue, yellow, orange, or red in two categories (cases and positivity rate) and then awarding an overall score.
 Last week, the first week the scores were released, Howard County received "blue" scores, the best possible, in the overall weekly score and for its seven-day posivitity rate, meaning it was less than 5 percent. The county received a "yellow" score in the category of weekly cases per 100,000 residents, meaning 10 to 99 new cases were reported.
 This week, the county lost its "blue" scores and moved to "yellow" across the board for a slightly increased positivity rate (5.24 percent), which affected the overall weekly score, moving it to "yellow." To score "blue," counties must have fewer than 10 new cases of COVID-19 per week and a seven-day all tests positivity rate of less than 5 percent.

HUNTINGTON — Savannah’s Restaurant in Huntington is planning on reopening soon, according to the new owner, but an official date has not been set.
 When Savannah’s closed its doors, Tara Dunn, a former employee of the restaurant, took on running the business with the intention of continuing the legacy and traditions of Savannah’s.
 The fine-dining establishment, located at 1208 6th Ave., has received numerous awards and accolades over the years, including the Five Diamond Award of Excellence from the North American Restaurant Association, the Wine Enthusiast Award of Unique Distinction, the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence and the Talk of the Town Award for Customer Satisfaction.
 Dunn grew up in Huntington and began working for Savannah’s because the restaurant needed extra help during the holiday season. She worked full time for the restaurant, and the owner, Ava Bicknell, became a role model and like a second mother to her.
 “I talked about owning the restaurant one day, and when the opportunity came available to run the restaurant myself, I went for it. I talked to the head chef, who agreed to return to run the kitchen, and then I went after my dream,” she said.
 Dunn raised three children in Huntington and has worked on and off for 21 years for Savannah’s.
 She was referred to Unlimited Future for getting her business started, and she met with Ursulette Huntley and Jules Bills from Unlimited Future a few occasions before signing up for Planning for Profit, an eight-week business startup taught by Unlimited Future’s training director, Jules Bills.
 “Jules has been great, and what I love about her the most is she has helped me whenever I needed it,” Dunn said. “She would help me fill out the paperwork, come to the restaurant, coach me through challenges and kept me on track. … If I didn’t have Unlimited Future, I do not think I would have been able to do this.”
 Dunn has been busy getting the restaurant ready to reopen with fresh paint and look, while keeping many of the same traditions such as menu item favorites.
 “We’re excited that we are going to offer brunch on Sundays that will include an awesome brunch menu along with drink specials,” she said. “We will be serving dinner Thursday through Sunday that features different specials.”
 You can keep up with updates on Savannah’s reopening on their Facebook page or call the restaurant at 304-529-0919.
