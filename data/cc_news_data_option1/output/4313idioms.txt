"As vice president I'm president of the Senate. And I'm gonna be in the chair because I wouldn't miss that vote for the world," Pence said.


  Democrats have pushed back against Pence's plan in light of recent positive coronavirus testing of two top staffers in Pence's orbit.


  Democrats have also lambasted Trump and Republicans for moving forward with Barrett's nomination so close to the election, especially when the Republican- led Senate in 2016 refused to hold hearings for then-President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, nearly eight months before that year's election.

A stop, subsequent safety and another porous defensive effort broke out the roller coaster yet again as Dallas falls behind early.

Normally, whenever the Dallas Cowboys go wheels up for a trip to Maryland to face the Washington football franchise, they prepare to play a home game on road soil. Because of the proliferation of Cowboys fans that reside in the Washington, DC region, and because the home team is normally bad and rarely gives their home fans a reason to pay to see them, games at Fed Ex Field normally have more Cowboys fans in attendance than any other road venue.

Moreover, it’s hard to justify an English-language remake of _The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo_ (especially one that cost $90 million in 2011) when A) the original thriller was widely available on DVD and B) most overseas audiences would have to watch it dubbed or with subtitles just the same as if it were the original Swedish-language flick from 2009. Some of this goes into my “rip- off, don’t remake” philosophy, as a shameless modern update like _Disturbia_ is going to have more relevance and a longer shelf-life than a straight-up _Rear Window_ redo. Ditto a legacy sequel like _the Craft: Legacy_ versus a straight remake of _The Craft_. You’re creating “yes, and…” content that makes the previous version more valuable and avoids direct comparisons with the previous film or adaptation. _The Fast and Furious_ and _Insidious_ spawned blockbuster franchises. The remakes of _Point Break_ and _Poltergeist_ did not.

  The new reporting by the Mississippi Department of Health leads to a total of 115,088 COVID-19 cases and 3,255 COVID-19 related deaths statewide since the state began tracking the virus in March.


  Gov. Tate Reeves announced additional COVID-19 measures on Monday. People in nine counties, including Neshoba, have to wear a mask when they are indoors and interacting with the public, but cannot social distance. Indoor social gatherings in those counties must be limited to 10 people and outdoor social gatherings must be limited to 50.

As _Dancing With the Stars_ fans are fully aware, ABC fired longtime host Tom Bergeron ahead of Season 29. The show then tapped Tyra Banks to take his place. In a recent interview on the _Stuttering John Podcast_ , Bergeron was asked whether he misses the show, and the former _DWTS_ host did not hold back in his response.


  When asked whether he misses _DWTS_ , Bergeron immediately replied, "No. No, because it started changing early in 2018, there were staff changes and I think philosophical changes about how to do the show. So, I miss the earlier years. I miss up until that point when it had a different vibe, a different feel. No, I'm kind of digging this time off and I'm quite capable of being very lazy." The interviewer then asked whether Bergeron would take on another job at the moment. For the former host, it would entirely depend on what the job would entail. Bergeron said, "No, it would depend. I never say never. But, I've hosted, as you've pointed out, so many different formats. I'm not really looking to work a lot, five days a week ... Now, I'm 65, I've got some money in the bank. I'm enjoying my life."


  Elsewhere in the interview, Bergeron was asked about the new "creative direction" that _DWTS_ has taken itself in, including the fact that they tapped Banks to take his place. But, the former host held his tongue and kept his answer on the demure side. "Well, I can't speak to their (producers) mindset," Bergeron said. "Look, my bottom line is, I've had a wonderful career. I've got friends who are still on that show, both on camera and behind the scenes, so, out of respect for them, that's about all I'll say." He later added that some of the pros on the show even reached out to him when he announced in July that _DWTS_ had fired him alongside co-host Erin Andrews.


  The former _America's Funniest Home Videos_ host said, "There are a lot of people who I really care about who are on that show, who I hope have long, thriving careers. And to those who came to me when the word came down in July that I wouldn't be part of it anymore, some of the pros said, 'We don't know if we want to be part of it.' I said, 'Look, you're building a brand, you're in your 30s, or late 20s or whatever, and I'm an old guy. I've made my money. I'm alright, so don't worry about me. Just go and build your brand."

Yes, the IP is available for the purchase and brand awareness is of prime importance, but the “perfect” older movie being remade (or revamped) is more readily available than ever before. Why go to a theater (or pay PVOD prices) to watch a remake of _Memento_ when the original is available to rent. If you’re revamping the _Men in Black_ franchise, then _Men in Black International_ better be good enough to justify not just watching _Men in Black_ or _Men in Black 3_ at home. Rupert Wyatt and Matt Reeves’ _Planet of the Apes_ movies passed this test. Chris Nolan’s _Batman Begins_ passed this test. Alas, recent redos of _The Witches_ and _Rebecca_ are, like _Amazing Spider-Man_ , so damn similar and/or beholden to prior filmed versions that they negate their own existence. Watching _Rebecca_ (2020) and _The Witches_ (2020) serves only to remind you that you’d rather be watching _Rebecca_ (1940) and _The Witches_ (1990).

There aren't a lot of chances to get home these months.


  College football players' lives are scheduled to the hilt. If South Carolina's guys are from Columbia, they can probably sneak in a quick visit to see family, but even that doesn't happen often once a season begins. If they're from farther away, a trip home probably isn't happening.


  An off week is traditionally a chance to slip out of town. A few days of no activities are built into the schedule. Their coach, Will Muschamp, won't tell them they can't leave. But ask the current set of Gamecocks, coming off a loss to LSU, and a few don't seem set on going home.


  "I'm definitely not going home," tailback Deshaun Fenwick said. "Probably catch up on some schoolwork, get ahead or just try and relax."


  Fullback Adam Prentice, who is from California, added: "I think if you left the state, we'd have to quarantine. I'm not 100% sure about that. But I'm planning to stay and I think a lot of guys are to get some necessary recovery."

This is ever more important in our current VOD/streaming/DVD era, where audiences have the ability to access the previous versions of a given movie at the click of a button in high-quality at-home exhibition. Why sit through Tom Cruise’s mediocre _The Mummy_ when you can either A) watch _Edge of Tomorrow_ or _Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol_ or B) watch _The Mummy Returns_ or _The Scorpion King_ on VOD or streaming? The differences between Stephen Summers’ swashbuckling _The Mummy_ and the 1941 original may be night and day, but not so much the 1999 adventure and the 2017 incarnation. Filmmaking frankly hadn’t advanced that much, comparatively speaking, over the 18-year gap. And why watch Robert Zemeckis’ inferior _The Witches_ on HBO Max for any reason other than passive curiosity when you can watch Nicolas Roeg’s superior _The Witches_ on Netflix?  Of course, streaming counts on passive curiosity, but I digress.
