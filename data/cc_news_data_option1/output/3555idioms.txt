Even though the month of September in Erie has featured some terrific weather in recent years, Labor Day marks the unofficial end of summer. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly put a damper on many of the usual Erie summer highlights, but our weather has been nothing short of fantastic. Many local people claim they've never seen so many gorgeous sunsets. On the other hand, most of us will look forward in 2021 to the return of Erie SeaWolves baseball, Presque Isle Downs horse racing, crowded ethnic festivals, 8 Great Tuesdays, CelebrateErie and so many other events that make the city such a special place in summer. Many season-oriented businesses bravely soldiered on in the midst of social distancing and the rest, but attendance at Waldameer Park & Water World and other venues took a steep decline. I only hope the financial hit many of the businesses suffered will not prevent them from returning to form once the pandemic passes. While many places will close for the season on Labor Day, Sara's, at the entrance to Presque Isle, will remain open through Sept. 30.
   
 Speaking of the SeaWolves, a lengthy piece on ESPN worries me about the future of minor league baseball in Erie. The contract between the Major Leagues and Minor Leagues ends on Sept. 30, and it appears the minors will have practically no leverage in negotiations. The ESPN report claims that minor league team owners who believe their franchises are safe, might be in for a rude shock. The only thing for certain, according to the story, is that nothing is certain.
   
 The recent death of former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson at 78 reminded fans of Gannon University men's basketball of the memorable 57-56 victory by the Golden Knights over the Hoyas at the 1975 Porreco Cup. Thompson, then in his fourth season as coach at Georgetown, was beside himself after the game, in which he felt his team was robbed. When I bumped into Thompson 20 years later at a banquet in New York City, I mentioned the game against Gannon in Erie. "Don't remind me!" Thompson said, shaking his head. But he admitted that the close loss woke up his team, which went on to win 21 games and a berth in the NCAA tournament. "It might have been the most useful loss we ever had," Thompson said.
   
 The late Betty and Hoot Scully would be so proud of their son, Steve Scully, who will moderate the Oct. 15 presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Steve is the 14th of Betty and Hoot's 16 children (including five sets of twins) and he's been a rising star in TV journalism ever since he started at WSEE many years ago. Steve has remained in close touch with his Erie family and friends over the years and has helped coax many national pundits to appear at the Jefferson Educational Society's annual forum in the fall.
   
 I recall some years ago when Betty was ill in the hospital that she took a call from President George W. Bush, who said he hoped she would recover quickly. Steve Scully has always had good friends in high places.

For the first time since 1979, two solo female artists were nominated for CMA Entertainer of the Year this year, with both Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert finding their names on the ballot when the 2020 nominations were announced last week. Speaking to media last week, Reba McEntire, who won EOTY in 1986, shared her thoughts on the nominations, noting that she was "thrilled."
 "I'm thrilled with the girls getting back in there," she said, via _The Country Daily_. "The thing that we have to realize and remember, whether it's a male or female, the song usually drives the situation -- it drives the boat. So when anybody has such a great song that can keep them in front of the public for a while -- because there's so much competition -- that's the thing. And then them coming in with the hard work and the creativity to do different things year after year."
 McEntire also praised Underwood, who co-hosted the 2019 CMAs with McEntire and Dolly Parton and visited 60 cities on her Cry Pretty Tour 360 last year. "Carrie has worked her tail off. I've watched her. I've watched her show," McEntire said. "I'm very impressed with how much work she puts into her production and to her creativity, whether it's the people who surround her [during] her concerts or her costuming -- she puts a lot of thought into it. She sings her butt off, so I'm very, very proud of Carrie coming in and working so hard and representing country music."
 Underwood has previously been nominated for the award in 2016 and 2019, where she was favored to win, though the honor ultimately went to Garth Brooks, the results of which led him to remove himself from future nominations in the category. This is Lambert's fourth nomination, as she was previously up for the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015. The last woman to win Entertainer of the Year was Taylor Swift in 2011, and the last time two women were nominated in the same year was 41 years ago, when Crystal Gayle and Barbara Mandrell were both up or the honor. This year's category is rounded out by Eric Church, Luke Combs and Keith Urban.
 While Underwood's tour ended in October, Lambert went straight from her Fall 2019 Roadside Bars and Pink Guitars Tour to her Wildcard Tour, which was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Underwood's most recent album was 2018's _Cry Pretty_ , while Lambert, who is now the most-nominated female artist in CMA Awards history, released _Wildcard_ in November. The 2020 CMA Awards will air Wednesday, Nov. 11 on ABC.

The Summer Olympics in Tokyo will not be pushed back again even if the COVID-19 pandemic is still going on next summer. International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates spoke to news agency AFP about the Olympics and said the start date is Jul. 23, 2021. Originally, the Olympics were set to begin in July of this year but were postponed due to the pandemic.
 "It will take place with or without COVID," Coates said while also adding the 2021 Olympics will be the "games that conquered COVID." The IOC said earlier the Olympic Games would not be delayed beyond 2021. And for the event, Coates told the AFP: "The Games were going to be their theme, the Reconstruction Games after the devastation of the tsunami. "Now very much these will be the Games that conquered Covid, the light at the end of the tunnel."
 Back in April, Tokyo organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said it's possible the Games may not happen in 2021 if the coronavirus pandemic is still happening. "I don't think anyone would be able to say if it is going to be possible to get it under control by next July or not," he said at a news conference. "We're certainly are not in a position to give you a clear answer." He also said if the Olympics could not be held in 2021, it would have to have canceled.
 With the Olympic Games being pushed back a year, athletes have had to make adjustments. USA Softball star Valerie Arioto recently sat down with PopCulture.com about competing in the Olympics for the first time in her career. She was disappointed about the Games being delayed but using the extra time to be the best player possible.
 "I was initially devastated, but I understood the situation," Arioto said. "We were on the road when we got sent home because of COVID-19 in March. It was funny because at first, I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I've been waiting so long for this.' I reframed it as 'I'm going to take that first part of tour [training January and February] and try to adjust for this next year of training to get better. Luckily for us, softball already qualified for the Olympics." This is the first time in the history the Olympic Games the event was postponed rather than canceled.

Matt Hardy seems to be doing okay after hitting his head on a concrete floor during All Elite Wrestling's pay-per-view event _All Out_ on Saturday night. AEW president Ton Khan went to Twitter to announce Hardy is out of the hospital after passing a concussion test. He was sent to the hospital right after his match with Sammy Guevara.
 "An update on Matt Hardy: it's great news! Matt's ok, we sent him to the hospital as a precaution & he's passed the MRI + CT scans, he doesn't have a concussion, and he's being driven home now," Kahn wrote on Twitter. "Matt will be at Dynamite on Wednesday night to thank you amazing fans for your support!"
 Fans were concerned about Hardy's health when he and Guevara crashed onto a table at _All Out._ Hardy's head hit the concrete as soon as he landed and Hardy seemed to be knocked out. He was able to get back up but was staggering and it seemed the referee called the match. Hardy said he was fine which led to the match continuing with Hardy ending up with the win.
 Hardy's wife, Reby, made it very clear that she was not happy the match was not called as soon Hardy hit his head. "Let me be absolutely f--ing clear. There is NOTHING entertaining about a concussion. Shame on everyone in that g --d-- building, she tweeted on Saturday. Reby was at the hospital with Hardy and said he suffered a concussion. However, Khan told reporters Hardy "cleared the concussion protocol" before the match continued.

 "When the doctor checked him, he passed him and cleared him on the concussion protocol," Khan said. "He checked with Matt and then Matt came back after and passed the concussion protocol and he's doing OK. I spoke with him after the match and talked to him again just now. He went as a precaution to the hospital to get some tests and check out that he's OK."
 Hardy, 45, joined AEW earlier this year after his contract with WWE expired in March. During his time with WWE, Hardy won the WWF/World Tag Team Champions six times with his brother Jeff. He has also won the Cruiserweight Championpionship, ECW Championship, United States Championship, European Championship and Hardcore Championship. Hardy also won the Raw and SmackDown Tag Team Championship a combined four times.

Anche per quanto riguarda il pubblico ci sarà un ridimensionamento: solo 150 persone presenti e una distanza di un metro e mezzo fra uno spettatore e l'altro. Data l'impossibilità di gestire la fase di reclutamento dal vivo, tutti i vip che hanno scelto di partecipare allo show hanno potuto inviare un video da casa.

L’assessore Orsomarso, introducendo l’incontro, ha presentato in sintesi gli interventi che la Regione dovrà presentare al governo sul Recovery fund, ed ha chiesto ai sindacati la presentazione di proposte sulla direttrice dell’innovazione e della semplificazione. Le parti hanno poi discusso del precariato storico, manifestando soddisfazione per la definizione dei bacini di lavoratori appartenenti alle leggi 12, 15, 31 e 40, e per le relative contrattualizzazioni e stabilizzazioni per chi ha già un contratto a tempo determinato. Sul percorso di stabilizzazione degli ex Lsu/Lpu, l’assessore Orsomarso si è impegnato a sollecitare al ministro del Lavoro l’atteso decreto attuativo. Più in generale l’incontro di oggi è stato finalizzato all’apertura di un confronto tra Regione e sindacati, strutturato e programmato che, attraverso l’operatività dei tavoli tecnici, abbia l’obiettivo di riordinare il mercato del lavoro calabrese e chiudere la stagione del precariato pubblico regionale. Per quanto riguarda il settore pubblico, si è discusso dell’apertura di una nuova fase di politiche attive del lavoro in linea con i fabbisogni professionali del mondo produttivo, al fine di costruire percorsi di lavoro privato stabile e di qualità. La organizzazioni sindacali hanno ribadito la necessità di coinvolgere tutti gli attori interessati (pubblici e privati) alla fuoriuscita dal tirocinio dei soggetti interessati, consapevoli che tutti sono chiamati a dare il loro reale contributo in termini di chiarezza ed effettiva fattibilità dei percorsi di contrattualizzazione.
