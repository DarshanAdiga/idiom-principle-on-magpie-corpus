 "I hope it can help corona patients, and I'm eager to see the results of the experiment," he said, according to a company press release. "Selinexor's mechanism has proven effective for various diseases, and also in consideration of the high safety profile of the drug, the decision of testing it also in viral disease is right and important."
 Karyopharm expects the clinical trial to be completed in about three months.
 It is too early to know what will happen next, Haas Mizrahi said.
 "We will need to receive all the data from the trial first," she said.
 The testing was approved by the Health Ministry and the Central Ethical Committee in Israel.

 "We are very committed to the Israeli community," she said.
