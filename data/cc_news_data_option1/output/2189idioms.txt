 While waiting for our sandwich to be made, we check out the refrigerator and freezer sections. During our last visit, we bought a crème brûlée to take home. It was wonderfully creamy and crunchy.
 We’ve tried a number of interesting butters including the locally made Ghost Rock Farms butter — by the way, the Ghost Rock Farms’ macaroni and cheese flies off the shelf — plus sheep butter from Wisconsin’s Carr Valley Creamery as well as its combo butter with sheep, goat and cow.
 There are cheeses from all over, but we were most excited to be introduced to Grand Mesa Creamery cheeses from Cedaredge. The Hog and The Hen is a store that selects from the world but really supports local businesses. We love that.

In fact, what we should do is take a moment and actually appreciate the lesson West is teaching all of us, particularly in this moment of national crisis. When all is said and done, what matters more is what is done than what is said. And by stepping up and making contributions to those impacted by America’s racial violence, rather than just talking about it, Kanye West is showing that he understands the power of actions as much as he understands the power of words.

Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan are all great pals today but, back in 2002, a major fight between the two superstars had erupted owing to Salmans fallout with his ex-girlfriend, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. It was reported that Shah Rukh Khan was done with Salmans friendship, when the latter barged in on the sets of Chalte Chalte and had a heated argument with Aishwarya Rai. Fed up with Salmans interruption on the sets, Shah Rukh not only replaced Aishwarya with Rani Mukerji in Chalte Chalte, but also almost cut off his ties with Salman. In 2008, things turned even bitterer for Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, when the duo came under one roof for Katrina Kaifs birthday bash. Reportedly, when SRK entered the party with his wife, Gauri Khan, Salman welcomed the actor with snide remarks, and took multiple digs at SRK for not doing a cameo in Main Aur Mrs. Khanna. Shah Rukh, on the other hand, gave it back to Salman Khan, and after a heated argument, SRK & Salman were on the verge of having a physical fight. Reportedly, it was Gauri and Katrina, who intervened between the two Khans and stopped the fight! In an interview with a magazine, when Katrina Kaif was asked if she has tried to resolve the issue between Salman and Shah Rukh, the Dhoom 3 actress had said, I dont know. This isnt about me. Its about Salman and Shah Rukh. I know Salman for many years but I dont control him. (Smiles) I dont even have control over him. Its a matter he has to sort out on his own. Back in those days, Katrina was allegedly dating Salman. In the same interview, when she was asked if she has mellowed down Salman, she said, I dont think so. If he has mellowed down, thats wonderful. On occasion, the media can be aggressive and write something hurtful. But at the end of the day, theres no need to be upset. Im glad that hes more comfortable with the media...because I think no one is against him.Cut to present, Salman and Katrina are good friends and even though the duo parted ways long back, they still got each others backs and are very comfortable with each other.CONFIRMED!

Schwenke and Dave Davia, chief executive officer of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors and another advocate pushing for a public vote on the independent oil and gas commission proposal, say negotiations had been taking place recently with setback supporters to drop all the ballot initiatives. But the setback supporters backed out for reasons that aren’t clear, Schwenke and Davia say.
 “We were willing to sideline our measure because now is not an ideal time for another expensive ballot fight. But this whole episode shows how broken, chaotic and absurdly political the system for regulating Colorado’s energy sector has become,” the two said in a joint prepared statement.
 In an interview, Davia said conversations were in the works last week about dropping the initiatives, but he later got the word that the group Colorado Rising decided not to pursue the deal that parties were reaching.
 “The bottom line is I’m disappointed,” Davia said.

Meanwhile, Apple held onto AppleTalk which itself survived well into the early 2000s when NetWare had already disappeared into the aether. The explosion of Wintel PCs throughout the 90s had given NetWare a market position that should have been very difficult to dislodge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The full story of NetWare's fall from grace is a story for another time, but I do want to go into the more technical aspects that were both the boon and bane of NetWare. Much of NetWare's success can be attributed to its own IPX protocol which made networking plug and play and drastically lowered latencies compared to NetBIOS or even TCP/IP.

Once you've escaped the glare of street lamps, neon signs and highrise apartments, you'll be treated to a light show of truly cosmic proportions. A good pair of binoculars should reveal even more astronomical wonders if you haven't got access to a telescope - just be careful you don't trespass on private property. Happy stargazing.

Aishwarya has a huge fan following and many look upto her as an inspiration. Not only fans but even celebrities love to work with her. But did you know that Aishwarya had once complimented Alia Bhatt for exploring her craft and her time in Bollywood? In a throwback interview, Aishwarya was asked to give a message to Alia Bhatt. On this, the Miss World said, “I’d like to say, way to go. It’s wonderful that she is enjoying and exploring her craft and her time here in films the way she is. I’ve said this to her also, it’s fantastic for you, the kind of support Karan Johar has given to her from the beginning. To have that kind of an establishment with you is very comforting. It’s not tough to have it laid out for you, for the longest time, and she smiled. It’s great for you as an actor as there is only good work and good opportunities ahead. What’s nice is she’s also doing good work along with great opportunities which are virtually there on her lap literally, regularly. So, it’s nice she is doing good work within that, so Kudos!"

France enters phase two of "deconfinement"! Restaurants and bars are back in business and Paris' parks reopen.

The jacket I am wearing here is the rather excellent Rivs from Italian maker Tucano Urbano.
 I like it because, style-wise, it reminds me of simple, straightforward leather jackets from back in the day – minimalist we’d probably call it in modern parlance.
 The difference, of course, is that it packs a host of up-to-the-minute features.
 First off, it is made from super supple, super soft goatskin leather.
 Stretch panels on either side at the back create a perfect fit whatever your ride position and there is a detachable quilted thermal vest liner for colder days.
 The shoulders and elbows have CE-approved armour and there is a pocket for an optional back protector.

The University of Idaho is knee-deep in a handful of construction projects and one of the most significant of these seeks to make major improvements to campus roadways that are reserved for pedestrians.
 UI Vice President of Facilities Services Brian Johnson said this project is multifaceted. The first phase will seek to create improved access for firefighters in a pedestrian mall between the school’s Memorial Gym and the building which houses the UI’s College of Education, Health and Human Sciences. He said the need for improved firefighter access was mentioned by fire officials during the approval process for previous renovations to the Education Building but it was difficult to include the work in the funding model for that project. Instead, Johnson said, the UI committed to pursuing those improvements in a separate, future project.
 “There’s already an existing (fire lane),” he said. “But our city officials would tell you, it doesn’t meet any requirements for modern firefighting equipment — it’s not wide enough, (and) it’s not strong enough.”
 Johnson said phase one of this project also seeks to “pedestrianize” a small road that loops in front of the UI Administration Building’s eastern entrance. This work would raise the roadway in the loop to make it more pedestrian- friendly and more prohibitive for cars — similar to the pedestrian mall surrounding the school’s Idaho Student Union Building.
 “Many of the central roads on campus were pedestrianized — they were closed to vehicular traffic — and the driver was when Mount St. Helens blew in 1980,” Johnson said. “(Because of) the ash cleanup that was needed in the core campus, all these streets were closed and when the ash cleanup was complete, the university made the decision to not reopen some of those roads.”
 Johnson said workers hope to complete work on the loop before the end of the summer. He said future phases of the project would seek to pedestrianize roads closed to traffic on the north of the Admin Building as well and would improve Campus Drive where it passes in front of Ridenbaugh Hall. However these future phases aren’t expected to get underway for at least a few years.
 The project costs about $1.7 million and is entirely paid for through the state’s permanent building fund, Johnson said.
 Johnson said another project installing turbines in the school’s steam plant is perhaps eight to 10 months from becoming operational. He said currently, the plant produces steam under high pressure which then needs to be filtered through a series of pressure reduction valves before it can be sent to buildings on campus.
 “As the steam runs through the pressure reduction valves, essentially, you lose energy and these turbine generators ... will be sited in parallel to these pressure reduction valves,” Johnson said. “If you route the steam through them, you will achieve the same pressure reduction but you will at the same time generate electricity.”
 Johnson said systems will be reconfigured to feed that extra power back into the campus grid. He said altogether, that project will cost more than $3 million and was financed entirely through university funds. However, the improvements are expected to save the university $298,000 annually, meaning the UI will recoup the full cost of the project in a little more than 10 years.
 Finally, a $1.6 million upgrade to the facade of the Bruce M. Pittman Center on the northeast corner of campus is nearly complete. Johnson said the project was supported through a combination of state and university funds.
 He said part of the reason terracotta tiles were selected to replace the old facade was because the russet color of the material would help tie the aesthetic of the Pittman Building to other structures on campus, many of which feature a brick exterior. He said the new facade and simultaneous improvements to insulation will boost the building’s energy efficiency as well.
 “That work is largely completed now … the terracotta panels are on the building now,” Johnson said. “The failing exterior tile system was all removed and a significant amount of exterior repairs were completed before those terracotta panels went up.”

While these tools used by serious kokanee anglers make it easier to find and catch fish, that doesn’t mean you need any of them to pursue these landlocked salmon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Now is a good time to give it a whirl: Kokanee fishing tends to be at its best through mid-summer, so if you want to try out kokanee fishing without breaking the bank, here’s how to get started.

“There have been so many tournaments cancelled this year, I wasn’t sure if we would even get to play this summer,’’ Laird said.
 Not even Wednesday’s thunderstorms could keep the Danville Horseshoe Club from opening on Thursday night.
 “Fortunately, our pits were dry tonight,’’ Block said. “And it was nice that we had some new guys here tonight.’’
 There was also a new female thrower — LinAnn Riggleman, who made her debut in the club pitching against Laird, her grandfather.
 “She is a third generation thrower,’’ Laird said. “She had two ringers and that’s great. She beat my first score.’’
 This season, the Danville Horseshoe Club has five teams and they will pitch every Thursday night at Douglas Park.
 The annual Danville Open Tournament is scheduled for Saturday, July 11th.

La Confederacion General del Trabajo (CGT) y la Union Industrial Argentina (UIA) prorrogaron el acuerdo marco original de abril para sostener "el empleo y la produccion en el contexto de la pandemia de coronavirus", que tendra otros 60 dias de vigencia y mantendra las suspensiones temporarias y el pago del 75 por ciento del salario neto, segun el articulo 223 bis de la Ley de Contrato de Trabajo. Regira a partir de su homologacion por parte de la cartera laboral.
 El convenio original habia expirado el 31 de mayo ultimo, por lo que los representantes de la entidad industrial y la central obrera lo extendieron hasta el 1 de agosto.
 Segun la UIA, las entidades procuran mitigar "el impacto de la pandemia a partir de un marco de previsibilidad que contemple tanto a trabajadores como a empresarios", por lo que continuara el pago de "una prestacion no remunerativa del 75 por ciento del ingreso neto y la continuidad de los puestos de trabajo durante el tiempo en que se haga efectiva la suspension de personal".
 Estaran exceptuados de esa realidad los trabajadores que no concurran a sus lugares de labor por estar encuadrados en algun grupo de riesgo o por tener mas de 60 años, y quienes hayan convenido con los patrones realizar tareas desde sus hogares.
 El acuerdo original que acepto la central obrera, que colideran Hector Daer y Carlos Acuña, habia estipulado "el compromiso empresario de no producir despidos durante su vigencia".

Brian Johnson passed away peacefully in his home on June 2nd 2020. Brian was born on September 27, 1952 and grew up on the Saanich peninsula. After a career as a red seal carpenter and raising his 3 children, he spent his remaining years enjoying retirement. He was an avid gardener and he and his partner Ruth spent many hours (and years) transforming their backyard into a piece of paradise. He was also an accomplished woodworker, his favourite projects were refurbishing old furniture, and other wooden pieces to give them new life. His sense of humour and larger than life personality will be missed. He will be remembered fondly by many. He is survived by his partner Ruth, his children; Todd (Shala), Ginelle (Gord), Chad, and grandchildren Arys, Cassia and Bowen. No service, donations to the Heart and Stroke foundation in Brian’s memory would be appreciated.

Influenced by The Who, their new sound was harder, and yielded hits like Fox On The Run and Action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    After Connolly departed the group in 1978, Priest took over lead vocal duties and Sweet continued as a trio until 1981.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ## 'A brave glam rocker'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    In recent years, there had been two competing versions of Sweet: Priest had the right to use the band's name in the US, where he lived, while guitarist Andy Scott toured the UK with an alternate line-up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Their biggest songs continued to get radio play - while Ballroom Blitz, a song inspired by a Scottish gig where the band were bottled offstage, gaining a new lease of life in the 1990s after featuring in the movie Wayne's World.

You can now start getting users to install your app right? Wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But how do you build reputation? First of all, Microsoft needs to be able to gather information on who has published the app, and this is done by a code signing certificate. The most obvious implication is that unsigned apps will always trigger SmartScreen. The more insidious implication is that acquiring a code signing certificate is a big expense for an individual developer. There is currently no “Let’s Encrypt” equivalent to code signing certificates; so you have to purchase it from trusted authorities. The price range is wide but a certificate only valid for a year will typically go for about $100.

Kanye West is putting his financial status to good use during the ongoing civil unrest in the USA. Ever since people started holding protests across the country to raise their voice against the brutal killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old security guard, who died after police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck rendering him unable to breathe, celebrities have been coming forward to join the Black Lives Matter movement. Not just by physically joining the protest, but also extending financial support.

Said Schwenke, “If they want to come back to the table obviously we’ll come back to the table.”
 Joe Salazar, executive director of Colorado Rising, declared that “there’s no deal” but declined to talk about any negotiations that occurred.
 He did say, “We receive overtures all the time about trying to pull back on our initiatives.”
 He said setback proponents are weighing their ability to proceed with getting any measure on the ballot this year. Initiative signature-gathering efforts are being complicated by COVID-19 social-distancing measures. Gov. Jared Polis has ordered allowing the gathering of signatures by mail or email, a move that now faces a court challenge, and meanwhile the Secretary of State’s Office has released rules for implementing the Polis directive. Salazar said setback proponents are following what happens with the court challenge and whether there will be enough time to move forward under the new rules. If backers of the setback measures have to gather signatures in person, they’ll have to weigh if that puts signature-gatherers and the public at risk, Salazar said.

Inmates do not have to worry about missing work, paying rent, or getting enough to eat. Inmates even have enough toilet paper! Inmates are already restricted in movement, so the “Stay At Home” order is redundant. They exist in a microcosm of society, a self-sufficient machine, and the prison “wheels” continue to turn despite the shutdown on the outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Recently, a famous astronaut gave some sound advice on how to cope with being housed in a small space, especially with other folks. The advice might translate well to incarcerated people. First, he said to have a schedule for all day, every day, and to follow it without fail. Time passes more quickly this way, and people feel more rewarded because they accomplish goals. Inmates can write letters, learn music, attend school programs, work their way through complex text, or otherwise refine skills with hobby craft and the like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In the end the inmate is the only one who can hold himself accountable for a productive schedule, but fruitfulness certainly improves a person’s state of mind and helps him cope. Second, he advised to accept being confined for a designated time with other folks, and, no matter how they react, try to make the best of the situation. Service personnel learn this acutely!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            A person does not have to like everyone else, but life is a whole lot better when people learn to get along. A smooth prison stay is more desirable than a tumultuous one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            These concepts are probably not groundbreaking and original, but sound advice is still sound advice. For an inmate to emerge from this crisis no worse for the wear is going to take some strategizing, but the people outside are being forced to evaluate similarly. Gratefulness for the many small things an inmate receives is a great start.

Of course, the experience of flying will be quite different for the foreseeable future, with a number of additional health protocols in place to ensure the safety of passengers. These will include enhanced cleaning on aircrafts and in terminals, contactless check-in and bag drop, face masks handed out for flights, physical distancing enabled on board, reduced or suspended in-flight meal services and increased access to hand sanitiser.

Instead, Polis announced last month that he was allocating $500 million to the state’s 178 K-12 school districts and $450 million to colleges and universities.
 On Thursday, House Speaker KC Becker, D-Boulder, Senate President LeRoy Garcia, D-Pueblo, and other legislators unveiled a long list of ideas, ranging from business loans to expanding access to unemployment benefits.
 “As a House and Senate majority caucus, we’re really focused on helping Coloradans get back to work safely and directing support for families and hard-working businesses,” Becker said.
 “There’s a large variety of impacts from COVID-19 to folks in Colorado and therefore we're really prioritizing a diverse set of legislation to help people get back on their feet,” added Senate Majority Leader Stephen Fenberg, D-Boulder. “One of the ones that we think is important is to ensure that businesses, especially small businesses have access to capital through low interest loans, or potentially even grants they can use to get back up and running.”

While NetWare did compete on UNIX, Sun had already gotten their foot in the door by porting NFS and making it the de-facto solution for all UNIXs of the era, as well as Linux. Meanwhile, Apple held onto AppleTalk which itself survived well into the early 2000s when NetWare had already disappeared into the aether. The explosion of Wintel PCs throughout the 90s had given NetWare a market position that should have been very difficult to dislodge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The full story of NetWare's fall from grace is a story for another time, but I do want to go into the more technical aspects that were both the boon and bane of NetWare. Much of NetWare's success can be attributed to its own IPX protocol which made networking plug and play and drastically lowered latencies compared to NetBIOS or even TCP/IP.

MOSCOW -- A Russian safety watchdog warned a subsidiary of mining giant Norilsk Nickel in 2017-2018 about dozens of violations at a fuel site in the Arctic where a huge leak of diesel fuel occurred last week, the RBC media portal reported on Friday.
 Greenpeace has compared the scale of the accident, which saw 15,000 tonnes of fuel spill into rivers and 6,000 tonnes into subsoil near the remote northern Russian city of Norilsk, to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.
 President Vladimir Putin has declared a state of emergency in the region and upbraided a senior official on television over what he said was a bungled state response.
 Norilsk Nickel, whose share price has been hit by the incident, has said melting permafrost driven by climate change may have eroded the foundations of a fuel tank at a power station in Norilsk, causing it to lose pressure and spill out the diesel fuel.
 Environmental scientists have warned for years that climate change causing the Arctic to warm faster than other areas of the world poses a threat to infrastructure built on permafrost.
 Rostekhnadzor, a safety watchdog, carried out three major spot checks in 2017-2018 at the power station operated by the Norilsk Nickel subsidiary and found an array of violations, including ones that concerned fuel tanks at the site, RBC reported.
 The power station was found, among other violations, to have failed to clean rust off the walls and roofs of some of its fuel tanks as it had been instructed to do by authorities years earlier, it said.
 Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, says that such violations had not been identified at the fuel tank that lost pressure however, but concerned other fuel tanks, the media portal reported. (Reporting by Tom Balmforth and Polina Devitt; Editing by Andrew Osborn)

A possible deal to drop various proposed state oil and gas initiatives that backers have been seeking to get on this fall’s ballot is off the table, at least for now.
 Industry advocates including Diane Schwenke, president and chief executive officer of the Grand Junction Area Commerce, are pushing to get a measure before voters that would establish an independent oil and gas commission. It would be made up of an even mix of Republicans, Democrats and unaffiliated representatives and appointed by a panel of retired judges.
 Pro-industry entities are pursuing other measures as well. Meanwhile, separate efforts are under way to get a drilling setback measure on the ballot, with various proposals calling for 2,500- or 2,000-foot setbacks of drilling operations from buildings.

With the COVID-19 pandemic in full swing across the globe, it has become imperative that the Namibian student population not be left behind as traditional educational institutions struggle to provide them with the education they require to become productive members of the Namibian workforce."

On an individual level, Salazar has endorsed Andrew Romanoff in Romanoff’s race against John Hickenlooper in the Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Cory Gardner, who is seeking re-election. Salazar said while the ballot measures have become a highlight in the primary race and candidates likely will receive questions on them, that isn’t a consideration when it comes to the question of whether to proceed with a setback proposal.
 “That’s not how we operate. Right now the concerns are COVID and the lawsuit against the executive order,” he said.
 The setback proposals concern industry advocates who worry about an increased setback putting some oil and gas out of the reach of drilling rigs or too difficult and expensive to develop.
 Meanwhile, Schwenke said of the independent commission proposal, “The whole concept is to take politics out of the picture and put at the forefront of it expertise and the best people to be on these boards making decisions.”

"Working on the film was a good process. It was a long wait. It started in 2015 with a script. At that time, there was no demonetisation. When demonetisation came, it had to be included in the script and we had to rewrite the script. Nihit Bhave kept on. Saiyami Kher came on board in 2017 and Roshan Mathew came on board 2018.

Accanto a tale indicazione è poi prescritta una dettagliata disciplina del contratto di garanzia finanziaria con trasferimento della proprietà, la quale rappresenta un meccanismo completo di autotutela privata. Ciò in quanto la tutela giurisdizionale è meramente eventuale, successiva e comunque subordinata al mancato rinvenimento di un previo accordo delle parti sulle condizioni di esecuzione, ovvero, quando queste siano comunque riconducibili a soggetti qualificati, dotati di compiti di vigilanza e di caratteristiche di imparzialità, con la conseguenza che, a livello probatorio, deve essere accertato che il creditore abbia agito in maniera irragionevole sotto il profilo commerciale. I tratti salienti della disciplina del contratto di garanzia finanziaria possono essere individuati nei termini che seguono. Anzitutto, deve potersi rinvenire il carattere istituzionale di entrambe le parti; in secondo luogo, deve potersi rilevare l’obbligo di restituzione dell’eccedenza in fase attuativa; infine, deve sussistere la tutela speciale dell’azione di irragionevolezza commerciale finalizzata alla rideterminazione dei criteri di realizzo.

While NetWare did compete on UNIX, Sun had already gotten their foot in the door by porting NFS and making it the de-facto solution for all UNIXs of the era, as well as Linux. Meanwhile, Apple held onto AppleTalk which itself survived well into the early 2000s when NetWare had already disappeared into the aether. The explosion of Wintel PCs throughout the 90s had given NetWare a market position that should have been very difficult to dislodge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The full story of NetWare's fall from grace is a story for another time, but I do want to go into the more technical aspects that were both the boon and bane of NetWare. Much of NetWare's success can be attributed to its own IPX protocol which made networking plug and play and drastically lowered latencies compared to NetBIOS or even TCP/IP.

A 19-year-old was arrested after he was caught in bed with a 15-year-old girl.
 On June 2, Cherokee County Sheriff's Deputy Jimmy Tannehill was dispatched to Hilltop Circle on a report of a disturbance. Dispatchers said the caller reported Chade Seaton climbed through her daughter's bedroom window and was trying to "hook up" with the girl.
 "I spoke to [the mother] and she stated she was in bed and her son said he heard someone having sex," Tannehill said in the sheriff's report. "[She] stated that she went looking to see what was wrong and found a guy in her daughter's bedroom."
 The girl's father grabbed a shotgun and hit Seaton in the head with it.

You can now start getting users to install your app right? Wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But how do you build reputation? First of all, Microsoft needs to be able to gather information on who has published the app, and this is done by a code signing certificate. The most obvious implication is that unsigned apps will always trigger SmartScreen. The more insidious implication is that acquiring a code signing certificate is a big expense for an individual developer. There is currently no “Let’s Encrypt” equivalent to code signing certificates; so you have to purchase it from trusted authorities. The price range is wide but a certificate only valid for a year will typically go for about $100.

The suggestion is that financial advisers had an interest in them doing so, as they could levy a charge only when the transfer went through.

The debate over pension transfers hit the headlines following the case of the British Steel pensioners who were pushed to transfer out of secure pensions in what was condemned as a feeding frenzy by advisers who levied high charges when transfers went ahead.

The FCA found that in 192 instances it reviewed, 21% appeared to be suitable, 47% appeared to be unsuitable, and 32% appeared to contain "information gaps".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The regulator will write directly to all 7,700 former members of the British Steel scheme who transferred out to "help them revisit the advice they received, and to complain if they have concerns".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Separately, it is conducting 30 enforcement investigations of pension advisers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The FCA's action has been criticised by some pension advisers, who say that genuine assistance will be lost as a result of the regulator's attempt to tackle rogues in the sector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Andy Bell, founder of AJ Bell, said: "Banning contingent charging swaps one set of problems for another and doesn't get to the heart of the issue.  Most importantly, defined benefit transfers will now become an option only available to the wealthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "Covid-19 will see the failure of businesses, which in turn will weaken or bring down final salary pension schemes.

Much of NetWare's success can be attributed to its own IPX protocol which made networking plug and play and drastically lowered latencies compared to NetBIOS or even TCP/IP.

ASK TONY: How did my £3,454 cheque with Halifax vanish into thin air when I tried to make a payment in euros?

After finding where the fish are, two of the most important aspects of trolling for kokanee are depth and speed. Early in the summer, kokanee can be found near the surface, but tend to move into deeper waters as temperatures rise. Kokanee feed almost exclusively on zooplankton, which are microscopic invertebrates that drift in the water column. In mid to late summer, kokanee are often found at 30 to 60 feet or more in their search for cold water and the best supply of zooplankton.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Getting your lure to the depth of the fish is best done with the aid of a downrigger. Manual downriggers can be purchased for less than $100, but you can troll successfully without them. With kokanee at shallower depths in the spring and early summer, downriggers are less important. Even as the fish move deeper later in the season, you can get your lure to depths of 30 to 60 feet without one, using tackle you likely already have in your tackle box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you are trolling without a downrigger, the amount of weight you are using, the amount of line you have out, the diameter of your line, and your trolling speed will determine the depth of your lure. A quick internet search will yield numerous helpful charts that explain how these are related. In order to get a good estimate, you will need to know how much line you have out, which makes a reel with a line counter extremely useful. If you have a way to check your speed, about 1.5 mph is a good place to start.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    One easy setup that can be used for trolling for deeper-water kokanee without a downrigger involves using a cannonball weight on a sliding sinker sleeve that leads to a swivel (see below), followed by a 18-24 in. leader to a dodger, and another six inches of line from the dodger to the terminal gear. The slider allows an angler to easily adjust their weight for a given trolling speed to get the right depth. It also allows the rod tip rather than the weight to absorb the energy from a hooked kokanee (which are notoriously soft-mouthed), and that should lead to fewer fish coming off the hook.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Another option: jigging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you want to avoid trolling altogether, vertically jigging spoons, bait, such as shoepeg corn, a piece of worm, or both, can be productive if you can locate a school of fish particularly later in the summer. Again, if you are without a fish finder, look for areas where boats (and likely kokanee) are concentrated and start there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Drop your jig deeper than you think the kokanee are likely to be, then gently jig with your rod while slowly reeling your line (just a few turns at a time). Hopefully you will catch a fish, then try to immediately return to that depth. You can hit a consistent depth by flipping your bail and counting how many seconds you let the jig sink, then count how many times you turn your reel handle on the retrieve.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    If you have a two-pole permit, you can also fish a drone rod and let the motion of the boat do the jigging, or use bait on that rod and manually jig with the other.

Many of the everyday freedoms that were suspended in mid-March have been slowly reintroduced in recent weeks and with more restrictions due to be lifted later this month, it's somewhat easy to imagine that life is now slowly returning to normal. In truth, there's still a long way to go before we have everything back that we once had. Perhaps the most notable prohibitions that continue to stand are interstate and international travel bans, however, while it's unlikely that trips overseas will be an option before the end of the year, news from the airline industry signals a return to freer domestic movement within the month.

You can now start getting users to install your app right? Wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              But how do you build reputation? First of all, Microsoft needs to be able to gather information on who has published the app, and this is done by a code signing certificate. The most obvious implication is that unsigned apps will always trigger SmartScreen. The more insidious implication is that acquiring a code signing certificate is a big expense for an individual developer. There is currently no “Let’s Encrypt” equivalent to code signing certificates; so you have to purchase it from trusted authorities. The price range is wide but a certificate only valid for a year will typically go for about $100.

Wrong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But how do you build reputation? First of all, Microsoft needs to be able to gather information on who has published the app, and this is done by a code signing certificate. The most obvious implication is that unsigned apps will always trigger SmartScreen. The more insidious implication is that acquiring a code signing certificate is a big expense for an individual developer. There is currently no “Let’s Encrypt” equivalent to code signing certificates; so you have to purchase it from trusted authorities. The price range is wide but a certificate only valid for a year will typically go for about $100.

Fried began filming this group of wide-eyed, beatboxing college grads in 2005, when they did a run of shows at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival to mixed reception and again in 2007 when Kail and Miranda are about to debut “In the Heights.” The hook is that after some on and off years and then a big hiatus while “Hamilton” took off, the group reunites for a 2019 run of off-Broadway and Broadway performances. Or, as Kail puts it “one last ride.”

When it became apparent the state would lose upwards of $400 million in revenue for the next fiscal year, the Scott administration was prudent and asked state agencies to cut spending by two percent, or $32 million through July, August and September. House lawmakers Wednesday reversed those cuts, preferring to wait until August when they intend to pass a full budget for FY2021. Spending for the first quarter of this fiscal year will be largely a repeat of spending for the first quarter of this year.
 The decision by lawmakers to postpone the inevitable is defensible because so many variables are unknown. We don’t know if there is more stimulus money coming our way and we don’t know the limitations of the $1.6 billion we do have. We don’t have a clear idea of the damage, or how quick or complete the recovery will be. We don’t have a clear vision as to the pandemic itself and whether another wave will come, or whether a vaccine will be found sooner than expected. We don’t know whether our schools will reopen, or at what level. We don’t know how many businesses will be lost and how many people will remain unemployed.
 There is every reason to believe we won’t know the answers to these questions in August when the full budget is prepared. But we should know more than than we know now. When you’re talking about state government — and the health and welfare of Vermonters, it’s important to weigh all considerations and to have as much information as is humanly possible.
 The decision by House lawmakers to wait and to spend close to normal levels for the next three months doesn’t change the outcome. It just piles the necessary cuts into nine months instead of 12. It makes it harder for those affected, only because the cliff ahead becomes steeper.
 By delaying the cuts and proposing to do a complete budget in August lawmakers are also taking it upon their shoulders to help identify where the cuts are to be made and to what degree. That’s the difficult, albeit essential work. The acknowledgement is that a $400 million shortfall can’t be made up by across- the-board cuts. Some programs will survive, many will not. They can’t. It’s better to have a few programs kept strong, than to keep all programs alive and having all of them on life support.
 There will also be programs that will need more, not less money. Child care programs are one. At least initially the state is going to need to up its subsidies of child care centers; these centers, for the immediate future, are an essential underpining of the need to restart the economy. Without them, businesses can only limp forward, at best. That makes no sense.
 This issue is not partisan. It should appeal to Republicans and Democrats in equal measure. The only way to rebuild the economy is to get people back to work. It’s the revenue that businesses generate that pays for the programs that make up the budget. This is also a cause that addresses all levels of the economic scale. Adequately subsidized child care is perhaps one of the best tools we have to lift up the poor and middle class. Do that, and the economy rises.
 It’s also a tool to use in dealing with our sagging demographics. In the moment there is a rush to buy real estate in Vermont; people are interested in Vermont as a safe place to live and work. That may be Covid-19’s silver lining for Vermont. Everything we do to put together next year’s budget should be built around the need to have our economy sustainable and progressive.
 It’s difficult stuff, and its unavoidable. It’s a budget process that should include all our voices.

Zoos in England have been told the earliest they can reopen is in July.
 Mr Field said: "We are talking to the Scottish government and hope we can reopen within the next few weeks if Scotland moves into the next phase of lockdown and outdoor attractions can open again.
 "Zoos with these covid-secure restrictions will be just as safe as private gardens and far safer than a crowded beach or public park.
 "The many educational, physical and mental health benefits of visiting zoos and enjoying nature are also well known, which is why zoos in Europe have been among the first places to reopen."

Step forward the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Traditionally, these winter-defined parts of the Nordic landmass have competed with each other for visitors, despite the fact that some overseas markets - Britain included - tend to see them, not a little unfairly, as much of a muchness when it comes to ice hotels, husky excursions, wood-fired saunas and encounters with the aurora borealis. But sensing that this is also a quiet time in which to make a loud statement, the three nations have banded together to promote their uppermost areas beneath the banner of “Arctic Europe” (thisisarctic.com).

EDIT - hello all. Thank you for all the lovely messages. I should have said that the main reason I posted was to thank the incredible folk who stopped and helped (although the sympathy is very cheering) so don’t worry I’m ok and being well looked after. Richard has been amazing and the kids are being very sweet ❤️ Lots of love. I ended up in a&e last night after I took a tumble from the tow path down to the side of the Thames on my bike during an evening cycle. I’ve put the photo in black and white so it’s not too gory. 🩸I am ok, just a bit bruised and sore. I want to thank the ambulance crew and the staff at west mid hospital (where I was born, as it happens) for gluing me back together. I also want to thank Lucas, Colin, Josh and Willow who were 4 runners who stopped and helped @richardjonesface and I when I hurt myself. You were so calm, thoughtful and reassuring. Thank you very much. I hope you see this message as I didn’t get your details. You’re all lovely people. Xxxx

Some old-school Harley riders may give the Iron short shrift, but this bike is undeniably cool.
 It is part of the company’s Dark Custom range, so looks mean and moody with the frame, engine casings, exhausts and most other parts blacked out.
 The only colour on my silver test bike was on the rather groovy peanut tank and the two fenders.
 It may be a smallish version of it, but that V-twin motor is unmistakable and completes the look, showing this bike means business.

We raced across Kimberley with the hot summer sun beating down on us, but we were never going to make it. As we got closer to the church, we spotted a police helicopter hovering above and, not surprisingly, we had to go through two police checkpoints to get to where we were supposed to park. The car was searched at both checkpoints and we were frisked and told in no uncertain terms to adhere to the rules governing the day. Cameras were forbidden, identity documents checked and names ticked off a list.

“But the world is looking to semi-localize supply chains, and we are seeing a big push for this with new production facilities being planned, particularly in Europe,” Rawles said. “Having said this, these new facilities seem to be largely focused on the cathode and battery sections of the supply chain, and little in the pipeline for chemical refining.”

Yes, most of us may not be as posh as the Mehras. But it is safe to assume that problems like theirs trickle down to all classes in India. And it is made worse by the ongoing lockdown induced by the coronavirus outbreak. The Mehras were stuck together, and forced to confront each other on a cruise ship. We may not be on board the Sovereign, but the situation is rather similar. They were surrounded by endless stretches of ocean, which happens to be the virus in our case.

The lockdown, like Dil Dhadakne Do, has taught us how to live with our families despite the differences, just like we will learn to live with the virus now.

While NetWare did compete on UNIX, Sun had already gotten their foot in the door by porting NFS and making it the de-facto solution for all UNIXs of the era, as well as Linux. Meanwhile, Apple held onto AppleTalk which itself survived well into the early 2000s when NetWare had already disappeared into the aether. The explosion of Wintel PCs throughout the 90s had given NetWare a market position that should have been very difficult to dislodge.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The full story of NetWare's fall from grace is a story for another time, but I do want to go into the more technical aspects that were both the boon and bane of NetWare. Much of NetWare's success can be attributed to its own IPX protocol which made networking plug and play and drastically lowered latencies compared to NetBIOS or even TCP/IP.

Cambodian police on Friday ruled out a probe into the alleged disappearance of a self-exiled Thai democracy activist after a rights group said he had been abducted in broad daylight from outside his Phnom Penh apartment.
 Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a sharp critic of the Thai government led by ex-general Prayut Chan-O-Cha, was dragged into a black car on Thursday evening, according to Human Rights Watch.
 Citing several witnesses and CCTV from security cameras, HRW says he was on the phone with a colleague when he was taken by "a group of armed men".
 But on Friday, Cambodian police said they knew nothing the of the alleged disappearance.
 "We don't know about it, so what should we investigate?" Chhay Kim Khoeun, the spokesman of Cambodian National Police told AFP.
 Wanchalearm is wanted in Thailand for allegedly breaching the criminal Computer Crimes Act by running an acerbic anti-government Facebook page.
 Since a May 2014 coup, Thailand has vowed to track down pro-democracy critics, especially those accused of attacking the kingdom's unassailable monarchy.
 Wanchalearm last posted on his personal Facebook account a few hours before his disappearance, writing cryptically "Compromise Mode".
 At least eight prominent Thai activists who fled after the last coup to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam have subsequently disappeared, HRW added.
 A spokesman for Cambodia's Interior Ministry suggested the HRW report could be "fake news".
 "We don't where HRW got the information," Khieu Sopheak told AFP, adding "there's a lot of fake news out there".
 Thailand's government emerged from the 2019 elections but remains a legacy of the coup five years earlier with a cabinet stacked with ex-generals and their military allies.
 Pro-democracy parties and activists have been hemmed in by legal cases.
 The Prayut government is increasingly unpopular -- more so as the coronavirus rips through the Thai economy.
 In an expletive-laden video posted on Facebook June 3 which ran up 12,000 views, Wanchalearm hammered the government and the premier for his "failed administrative skills".

_Stimo moltissimo Carolyn Smith. Lei è una vera donna power. Nonostante quello che ha passato ha sempre il sorriso e sul web lancia messaggi molto importanti. Mi piacerebbe moltissimo anche perché coltivare i talenti è una cosa bellissimo e il ballo è un talento a tutti gli effetti. Accetterei di partecipare anche come concorrente perché imparerei a ballare. Quando ero piccola frequentavo la scuola di danza ma poi ho interrotto. Partecipare sarebbe una bella sfida per me. Non si sa mai nella vita ma se dovesse succedere non mi tirerei indietro._
