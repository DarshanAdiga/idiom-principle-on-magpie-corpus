Jonny Evans may have made his Northern Ireland debut as an emergency left- back but since then he has matured into one of the most composed and consistent central defenders in the Premier League.


  When Lawrie Sanchez gave the 18-year-old Manchester United player his first cap in the sensational 3-2 victory over Spain in 2006, it was clear for everyone to see that here was a star in the making.


  However, it was at the heart of the Manchester United defence that Evans eventually made his name and in nearly 200 appearances for the Premier League giants he won three league titles and two League Cups.


  Now at Leicester City, his presence in the back four alone emits calmness to those around him - his assuredness on the ball and timing of his tackles are qualities that have seen him develop into a truly world class player.


  Evans was an integral part of Michael O'Neill's Euro 2016 squad and with 84 appearances to his name, and still only 32, he has every chance of becoming only the fourth Northern Ireland player ever to make it to a century of caps.

BCCI, like most other major sporting organisations, was caught off guard. Who could imagine that a virus would bring live sport across the world to a halt. Insurance against pandemic was not a necessity and, as a result, the league and teams all will lose heavily if IPL is a no-go this year, which is becoming a likelihood day-by-day. The losses could be north of Rs 100 crore for teams (combination of ticket sales, sponsorship and broadcast revenue share.) But it's not all doom and gloom. The product will have to reinvent itself and a possible scenario could be a no-spectator event...which could be beamed to houses across the world!

I was perusing a copy of the Ladies’ Home Journal from 1900, as I often do, when I happened upon “What May Happen in the Next Hundred Years,” an article by John Elfreth Watkins Jr.


  Watkins was somewhat of a visionary — as many of his predictions about innovation and technology have become true in the past century. Some, not so much.


  Let’s take a gander at what he predicted 120 years ago:


  ♦ “There will probably be from 350,000,000 and 500,000,000 people in America.”


  Pretty spot on. As of 2020, the population of the United States was 331,000,000. But Watkins is referring to “America,” meaning the North American continent, which has a population of 579 million.


  ♦ “Photographs will be telegraphed from any distance.”


  Watkins opines that “if there be a battle in China a hundred years hence, snapshots of its most striking events will be published in the newspapers an hour later. Photographs will reproduce all of nature’s colors.”


  True dat.


  ♦ “There will be no C, X, or Q in the every-day alphabet.”


  Quite counterfactual and inexact.


  ♦ “Trains will travel one hundred and fifty miles an hour.”


  Yep. There’s a bullet train in Japan that goes over 180 mph. And he also predicts that train “cars will, like houses, be artificially cooled.”


  ♦ “Automobiles will be cheaper than horses are today.”


  Still waiting on this. He also stated that horses will be scarcer in the future than “yoked ox is today.” I will inform you of the veracity of that statement as soon as I find out what a yoked ox is, or was.


  ♦ “Everybody will walk 10 miles.”


  He forecasts that “exercise will be compulsory in the schools. Every school, college and community will have a complete gymnasium.” Right. “A man or woman unable to walk 10 miles in a stretch will be regarded as a weakling.” Not exactly right.


  ♦ “Giant guns will shoot 24 miles or more, and will hurl anywhere within such a radius shells exploding and destroying whole cities.”


  Yes, sir. He also forecasts submarines being used in warfare.


  ♦ “Americans will be taller by one to two inches.”


  That’s actually accurate. He also astutely predicts a move of population from the city to the suburbs. “The trip to suburban home to office will require a few minutes only. A penny will pay the fare.” Not as astute.


  ♦ “Mosquitoes, house flies, and roaches will have been practically exterminated.”


  Not just no, but never.


  ♦ “Persons and things of all kinds will be brought within focus of cameras connected electrically with screens at opposite ends of circuits.”


  He foresees “the instrument bringing these distant scenes to the very doors of people will be connected with a giant telephone apparatus transmitting each incidental sound in its appropriate place.”


  So, that’s where Al Gore – a fellow Ladies Home Journal reader – got it from.


  Furthermore, he said “wireless telephone and telegraph circuits will span the world.”


  I couldn’t have predicted that 35 years ago.


  There’s more. He also correctly anticipates the escalator, the use of alternate forms of energy, laser surgery, and the rise of supermarkets. No word about a pandemic that keeps us quarantined for months. Still, quite the prognosticator, this Mr. Watkins, who was an engineer and museum curator by trade.


  Unfortunately, for him, there wasn’t a lottery in 1900.

_Saracens Mako Vunipola in action during a Gallagher Premiership match at Allianz Park_


  With Sarries due to play in the Championship next season as part of a series of punishments for salary cap breaches, the short-term prospects of their star international players has been a source of much intrigue.


  A handful have already signed permanent or loan deals elsewhere for the 2020-21 campaign, and while the likes of Jamie George, Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are committed to staying at Allianz Park, speculation continues to follow those who have yet to publicly follow suit.


  That includes the elder Vunipola and Itoje, with the latter linked earlier this year with a short-term move to French side Racing 92.


  Mitchell is happy for others, including head coach Eddie Jones, to offer counsel during the current coronavirus lockdown but is confident that the lure of pulling on an England shirt will be a guiding principle in any choice they do make.


  “I’m sure Eddie, as he is very good at, is guiding them and helping them. They’ll probably seek his advice at some point,” said Mitchell.


  “They’ve got people they respect in their families and friends and they’ve got people within Saracens they respect who they have built up trust with.


  “I’m quite confident both of them will make good decisions – decisions that are right for them and their families but also what’s right for them in terms of playing Test rugby for England, because they are two guys who love playing for England.”

At present Mitchell has no idea when he might see the likes of Itoje and Vunipola again, let alone when they will be back at Pennyhill Park working on drills.


  But, despite a long and impressive CV that includes a stint as All Blacks head coach, the 56-year-old is ready to embrace a new way of working that makes allowances for a world still coming to grips with the prevalence of social distancing.


  “When we do get the green button, we as a coaching group will need to be ready,” he said.


  “We’re going to have to be creative and innovative about how we do things. That’s exciting as well, it’s really refreshing to try a different way.


  “I’m sure a lot of our players are going to be better for the situation as well, a lot of them have had to find a way to train during this period with home constraints and that will benefit us in the long run. We can empower players when they do come back into the environment.”


  Selection might be another area that requires fresh thinking after a long lay-off that will deny international coaches the chance to assess the respective form of emerging talents and established names.


  “In the last cycle Eddie was very smart in this area,” added Mitchell.


  “In Lions year there was a window of opportunity to introduce players because of the load the top players experienced being in the Lions. That brought through the likes of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill.


  “I think there’s a real core in his thinking and strategy. Once rugby starts again, if that cycle recurs, there’s no reason why we won’t take the same window of opportunity to introduce younger players that could (reach) the World Cup.”

Così la capogruppo regionale del Movimento 5 stelle in Campania Valeria Ciarambino. "A partire dai tempi ancora biblici delle liste d'attesa - ha proseguito - Basti ricordare che per una mammografia si aspetta anche un intero anno, mentre per interventi urologici e oculistici l'attesa sale fino a tre anni, per non parlare della chirurgia oncologica. A scorrere i dati Agenas, si scopre che primi in Italia lo siamo anche per morti da ictus, mortalità tumorale, per mortalità materna e per morti evitabili. E laddove ci ritroviamo ultimi, in questo caso in Europa, lo siamo per aspettativa di vita. L'unico vanto della sanità campana sono la straordinarie eccellenze che vi lavorano, purtroppo mortificate da una politica che premia l'appartenenza politica a scapito del merito e della professionalità.

Over the past two decades, India's ranking in world cricket moved up dramatically, both on and off the field.  Mind you, this is not coincidental-- these two developments are closely linked. A leisurely game associated with the English countryside became India's favourite sport which on most days easily tops Bollywood blockbusters for television rating points. An important element of this transformation is the commercialisation of the sport.  From a genteel, noble and aristocratic sport, cricket today has transformed into a more indigenised game--a noisy, brazen and vivid commercial extravaganza catering to its biggest audience.

She had not even seen the Indian Premier League (IPL), that crazy crossover between _Mad Max_ and _Terminator_ , with the glamour and lucre of a Las Vegas casino thrown in. The gentleman's game invented by the stiff upper-lipped British to be played between lunch and afternoon tea is…well, no longer the pastime of lazy afternoons in the English countrywide. Cricket is now a board game, played as much by corporate honchos in pinstripe suits in five-star hotels as much by tattooed gladiators with rippling muscles and hairdos in front of delirious spectators in modern-day Roman amphitheaters. Even Kerry Packer's revolutionary day-night cricket league that introduced coloured clothing looks like kid's play now. Yes, IPL is no cricket. But fans say it's even better. Those who run the league say everyone's a winner. And no one seem to have enough of this money-minting, glamour-fuelled event that defies cricket's very grammar and language.

Deltapoll director Martin Boon said the result show that the UK public fears the virus more than its economic consequences.


  "So far, Britain’s workers are happy to stay locked up so long as money keeps flowing their way, even though many fear for the country’s economic future," he said.


  “There is a real fear that the economy is going down the tubes but the public still puts handling of the virus and lives lost ahead of economic consequences."


  The poll also shows a majority of the public approve of Mr Johnson's handling of the crisis, with 62 per cent saying he is doing well and 30 per cent saying he is doing badly.


  However, there are concerns about the shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS workers, with 59% saying the government is doing badly in this area.


  Meanwhile 68% are worried about the crisis in care homes, and do not feel residents and staff have been adequately protected.

The firm would have influence over voting in Congress and over government appointments in Republican administrations. When his close friend Colin Powell became secretary of state, Armitage himself followed him into government, serving as Powell's deputy secretary.


  But that type of high-powered consultancy was unheard of in Japan, so Okamoto had to start from scratch. He pitched his plans to business leaders so that they would be sponsors. To sustain the business, Okamoto Associates spread its wings to various areas, including serving as a go-between connecting U.S. venture capital firms with unique Japanese entrepreneurs.


  The ex-diplomat taught enthusiastically at universities, inviting students to home parties where he would enlighten them with his deep knowledge of history. He was passionate about nurturing a younger generation of talented individuals.


  Eventually, Tokyo came calling. Okamoto was tapped to serve in multiple Japanese governments, either in an official or an unofficial capacity. He took charge of Okinawa affairs under Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in 1996 as the first person to hold a special adviser post established in Japanese law. When the Iraq War broke out in 2003, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi asked Okamoto to handle Iraq issues.


  Both were critical junctures for the alliance with the U.S. He took the former position when the fate of U.S. forces in Okinawa -- in particular the controversial Futenma Air Base -- became the burning question.


  The latter responsibility came when deploying Japan's Self-Defense Forces to Iraq was a sharply divided issue due to its constitutional restraints. Building on the trauma of the first Gulf War, when Japan contributed $13 billion to the operations but was not thanked by Kuwait because it had not sent boots on the ground, the government -- as was Okamoto -- was determined to make visible contributions by sending the SDF this time.

The IPL also continues to see high sponsorship fees, underscoring the keenness of various brands to be associated with the IPL. The IPL title sponsorship fee has  grown a massive 800 per cent since its inception (when DLF became the title sponsor), to its current partnership with VIVO. As per GroupM, the IPL as a whole made US$ one billion in sponsorship money in 2017, compared to the US$ 892 million made by Major League Baseball. This is quite an achievement considering that the IPL season is shorter than the MLB season and given that sports is a major part of the US culture and economy whereas the economics of sports is just beginning to take root in India.

With Sarries due to play in the Championship next season as part of a series of punishments for salary cap breaches, the short-term prospects of their star international players has been a source of much intrigue. A handful have already signed permanent or loan deals elsewhere for the 2020-21 campaign, and while the likes of Jamie George, Elliot Daly and Billy Vunipola are committed to staying at Allianz Park, speculation continues to follow those who have yet to publicly follow suit. That includes the elder Vunipola and Itoje, with the latter linked earlier this year with a short-term move to French side Racing 92. Mitchell is happy for others, including head coach Eddie Jones, to offer counsel during the current coronavirus lockdown but is confident that the lure of pulling on an England shirt will be a guiding principle in any choice they do make. "I'm sure Eddie, as he is very good at, is guiding them and helping them. They'll probably seek his advice at some point," said Mitchell. "They've got people they respect in their families and friends and they've got people within Saracens they respect who they have built up trust with. "I'm quite confident both of them will make good decisions - decisions that are right for them and their families but also what's right for them in terms of playing Test rugby for England, because they are two guys who love playing for England." At present Mitchell has no idea when he might see the likes of Itoje and Vunipola again, let alone when they will be back at Pennyhill Park working on drills. But, despite a long and impressive CV that includes a stint as All Blacks head coach, the 56-year-old is ready to embrace a new way of working that makes allowances for a world still coming to grips with the prevalence of social distancing. "When we do get the green button, we as a coaching group will need to be ready," he said. "We're going to have to be creative and innovative about how we do things. That's exciting as well, it's really refreshing to try a different way. "I'm sure a lot of our players are going to be better for the situation as well, a lot of them have had to find a way to train during this period with home constraints and that will benefit us in the long run. We can empower players when they do come back into the environment." Selection might be another area that requires fresh thinking after a long lay-off that will deny international coaches the chance to assess the respective form of emerging talents and established names. "In the last cycle Eddie was very smart in this area," added Mitchell. "In Lions year there was a window of opportunity to introduce players because of the load the top players experienced being in the Lions. That brought through the likes of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill. "I think there's a real core in his thinking and strategy. Once rugby starts again, if that cycle recurs, there's no reason why we won't take the same window of opportunity to introduce younger players that could (reach) the World Cup."

De Warhol a Lichtenstein', en la que el Kupferstichkabinett, el museo de grabados e ilustraciones, presenta por primera vez las obras estrella de su colección de arte pop.


  OBLIGATORIEDAD DE MASCARILLAS Y ACCESO RESTRINGIDO


  El uso de mascarillas será obligatorio para acceder a esos lugares y el número de visitantes quedará limitado y se controlará por franjas horarias en los billetes de entrada.


  'Nos alegra poder levantar para algunos de nuestros museos los cierres vigentes desde el 14 de marzo debido a la pandemia del coronavirus', señaló el director general de los Museos Estatales de Berlín, Michael Eissenhauer.


  Agregó que la salud de los visitantes es la 'máxima prioridad', por lo que las medidas de seguridad se analizarán continuamente según las disposiciones oficiales, al tiempo que saludó este 'primer paso' de reapertura, a pesar de que la situación de acceso restringido implique 'considerables desafíos económicos' para los Museos Estatales, dijo.


  Otros museos anunciaron su reapertura para la semana entrante: el lunes el Gropius Bau, la Galería Berlinesa y los ubicados en la Ciudadela de Spandau; el martes el Centro Anna Frank, el Museo Käthe Kollwitz, el de Comunicación, el de Ciencias Naturales y varios museos palaciegos; el Futurium, el miércoles; el Museo de la Cinemateca Alemana, el jueves; y el viernes, el Museo Brücke.


  Varios de los casi 180 museos que hay en Berlín, sobre todos los privados, que dependen aún más de la venta de entradas, abrieron ya sus puertas el pasado día 4, como el de la RDA, el Alemán del Espionaje, el de cadáveres humanos plastinados de Gunter von Hagens y Dalí-La exposición, mientras que otras pequeñas galerías ya lo hicieron incluso antes.


  Al igual que en la capital alemana, el resto del país está ultimando los preparativos para la reapertura de sus principales lugares de exposición bajo estrictas medidas de higiene y seguridad.


  UN PRIMER PASO HACIA LA NORMALIDAD TAMBIÉN EN EL ÁMBITO CULTURAL


  La canciller alemana, Angela Merkel, expresó en su habitual vídeomensaje de los sábados su satisfacción por la reapertura de museos y lugares conmemorativos y celebró estos 'primeros pasos' hacia la normalidad, precisamente también en el ámbito cultural.


  Entre los programas lanzados por el Gobierno alemán para apoyar al mundo de la cultura figura la iniciativa 'Reinicio', que con hasta diez millones de euros financiará las reformas necesarias en equipamientos culturales para adaptarlos a la pandemia del coronavirus con el fin de contribuir a su pronta reapertura.


  Pueden optar a estas ayudas museos, salas de exposiciones, lugares conmemorativos, recintos de conciertos y de teatro y centros socioculturales, que podrán recibir entre 10.000 y 50.000 euros para la realización de obras destinadas a reducir el peligro de contagio en caso de una reapertura.


  'La cultura es un alimento para nuestra democracia', afirmó la responsable de Cultura alemana, Monika Grütters, al presentar el programa.


  Agregó que 'precisamente en estos tiempos, la cultura fortalece la cohesión social y la participación' y subrayó que la reapertura de museos y lugares conmemorativos 'sería un próximo paso importante para garantizar una atención cultural básica'.


  'Nuestro objetivo es que nuestro amplio y diverso panorama cultural pueda seguir existiendo una vez superada la pandemia, una vez superada esta profunda incisión. Es una tarea ambiciosa, pero esta tarea figura entre las principales prioridades del Gobierno', aseguró Merkel. EFE

Violence against Indigenous women during COVID-19 sparks calls for MMIWG plan
 Teresa Wright
 The Canadian PressMay 10, 2020, 8:00 a.m. UTC
 OTTAWA — With reports of a sharp rise in violence against Indigenous women as COVID-19 restrictions keep families stuck in their homes, concerns are being raised about whether the pandemic could delay the promised June delivery of a national action plan on missing and murdered Indigenous women.
 The Native Women's Association of Canada has been conducting a series of nation-wide, grassroots consultations with their local member offices and with Indigenous women to determine how COVID-19 has been affecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis women in Canada.
 The preliminary results reveal a deeply concerning spike in the number of Indigenous women who say they are facing more violent incidents since the pandemic began, often by an intimate partner.

  __
 A survey of more than 250 Indigenous women  found one in five reporting they've been a victim of physical or psychological violence over the past three months.
 Also, the preliminary results of this survey and two additional consultations suggest more of these women are concerned about domestic violence in the midst of this pandemic than they are about the virus.
 Native Women's Association President Lorraine Whitman says she finds the numbers "shocking" and is deeply concerned about the safety of Indigenous women in Canada, as public health officials continue to ask people to remain in their homes.
 "We know in a perfect world staying at home is a safe place, but it isn't a perfect world and it isn't a safe place for some of our women and families," Whitman said.
 "With the social distancing and self-isolation, women have had to stay in a home in a confined area with their abuser or perpetrator and they cannot escape. There's nowhere where they can go."
 The federal government did commit $40 million in funding to Women and Gender Equality Canada, with up to $30 million earmarked for the "immediate needs" of shelters and sexual assault centres. Another $10 million was provided to Indigenous Services Canada's existing network of 46 emergency shelters on reserve and in Yukon to support Indigenous women and children fleeing violence.
 Story continues
 But Whitman says many shelters and sexual assault centres in the country are not run for or by Indigenous people, which is why many First Nations, Inuit and Metis women won't access them, even if they're in trouble.
 "They don't have that comfort zone there and they're not culturally influenced or inclusive of the Indigenous values that we have and our traditions and ceremonies."
 Even before the pandemic began, Indigenous women in Canada were facing higher levels of violence and abuse — a stark reality laid bare in the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.
 The situation has been made worse by the arrival of COVID-19 in Canada, Whitman said.
 That's why, earlier this week, the Native Women's Association held a virtual roundtable with Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne and International Development Minister Karina Gould urging the federal government to implement a national plan for meeting the inquiry's 231 "calls for justice."
 The urgency has been heightened by the global pandemic crisis, Whitman said.
 "We need to have some action. The families of the missing and murdered women and girls and two-spirited (individuals), we're tired of talk. If you're going to talk the talk, walk the walk. And I'm not seeing that."
 Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett said in December the federal government would release its national action plan to respond to the inquiry's findings in June of this year, which would mark the one-year anniversary of the release of the calls for justice.
 In Ottawa on Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said work on this national response to the inquiry's work has been ongoing and that this work is "more important than it has ever been."
 "This government has worked from the beginning to give more support to shelters and organizations and networks that are supporting victims of family violence or gender-based violence. We will continue to do that work," he said.
 "We will continue to work very hard on that national action plan coming from the missing and murdered inquiry. This is a priority that continues and is even intensified because of this crisis."
 Michele Audette, who worked as a commissioner on the MMIWG inquiry, says she believes work on the national action plan — which she says must also include commitments from the provinces and territories — has been delayed by several events over the last year, including the election.
 However, she believes even if an action plan had already been in place before the pandemic began, she's not convinced it would have changed the sad realities now being faced by Indigenous women experiencing increased incidents of violence.
 "I don't know if we would see a change right away because it's rooted so deeply in the culture, the colonial system," Audette said.
 "Because we are facing the impact of colonialism, we are not a top priority and we can see it with COVID right now."
 She stressed the need for all levels of government — federal, provincial, municipal and Indigenous — to ensure shelters, social workers and first responders who serve Indigenous populations are well supported so they can respond to issues of violence against women.
 NDP MP Leah Gazan says the Liberal government has failed to adequately respond to the MMIWG inquiry's work.
 "With the increasing rate of violence, which has occurred during COVID, we are now in an even worse crisis," she said.
 "We need to move swiftly. This is a life and death situation."

"Another year, yet another excellent album from Black 47! It’s hard to fathom how they can keep it so fresh after twenty years, but they do it. Their previous album Iraq, a vividly thematic soldiers-eye view of the never-ending war, took the #1 spot on our best-of-2008 albums list. This one finds the Irish-American rockers exploring more diverse terrain, a characteristically eclectic mix of Clash-style anthems, a small handful of electrified Celtic dances, a reminiscence of better days in the New York rock scene, snarling sociopolitical commentary and more lighthearted, comedic fare. The title track, a big sardonic Clash-style anthem speaks for the generations disenfranchised by the new Great Depression; likewise, the vivid opening cut, Long Hot Summer Coming On ominously foreshadows a city where all hell’s about to break loose. There’s also a fiery tribute to Rosemary Nelson, the murdered Irish human rights crusader; a cynical number about an Irish music groupie; and a couple of absolutely surreal ones, the first about a Lower East Side romance circa a hundred years ago that isn’t actually as unlikely as it might seem (and on which the band proves perfectly capable of playing a good freilach), the other a long anthem based on the true story where former Jimi Hendrix bassist Noel Redding absconded with tapes of Hendrix’ last live recordings, using them as collateral for a mortgage in Ireland. All of this is catchy, a lot it is funny and you can sometimes dance to it, in other words, typical Black 47." _— Lucid Culture_

The world's finest players gravitate to India--like they once did to the English counties--to play in tournaments like the IPL, giving Indian youngsters exposure to the best. Money flows into grassroots cricket and better facilities for first class cricketers, who now at least have reasonable dressing rooms and quality practice facilities. Lastly, all this wealth helps cricket hire professional administrators who can effectively package and sell the sport to global TV networks and sponsors.  Rahul Johri, CEO of the BCCI- headed Discovery Channel in India; Sunder Raman former COO of the IPL was a senior media executive with WPP's Group M. In fact, Indian sport administration talent is now global--the Chief Executive of the ICC, Manu Sawhney, honed his skills as head of ESPN India and the trading arm of cigarette major, ITC. All because cricket can afford to pay top dollar salaries matching the best in the corporate world. Now contrast this with the folks who run other sports in India, and one can understand why these sports struggle to get the basics right.

BERLIN (AP) — They prepared for icy cold and trained to be on the watch for polar bears, but a pandemic just wasn't part of the program.


  Now dozens of scientists are waiting in quarantine for the all-clear to join a year-long Arctic research mission aimed at improving the models used for forecasting climate change, just as the expedition reaches a crucial phase.


  For a while, the international mission looked like it might have to be called off, as country after country went into lockdown because of the virus, scuppering plans to bring fresh supplies and crew to the German research vessel Polarstern that's been moored in the high Arctic since last year.


  News of the pandemic caused jitters among those already on board, said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado and co- leader of the MOSAiC expedition.


  “Some people just wanted to be home with their families,” he told The Associated Press in a video interview from the German port of Bremerhaven, where he and about 90 other scientists and crew have been kept in isolation to ensure they're virus-free.


  Organizers at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research managed to fly out a handful of people via Canada last month. The rest of the crew will be exchanged with the help of two other German research ships that will meet the Polarstern on the sea ice edge.

The government bailout of GM demanded the company close hundreds of its franchise dealerships, including the one in Cleveland.
 To boot, the population in The Bolivar Commercial’s footprint has declined significantly (15 percent since 2000), all this among poverty rates over 25 percent.
 Working at a newspaper is a lot like that time you forgot to do a big school project until the day before it was due – every day, and the whole readership is grading you. It takes a whole team of a certain kind of person to make that happen. It takes a diligent, stalwart, faithful people, like the staff of The Bolivar Commercial. Between them, the paper’s staff of 10 people marked a combined 222 years of working at that paper. The paper’s publisher, Diane Makamson, started her 42-year tenure at the paper as a bookkeeper.
 “What good is a local newspaper?” you might say.
 Journalism, in its creation and in its consumption, is about accountability. Local newspapers live that mission out to the fullest. They ask tough questions of the officials who have the most influence on our lives – how our city evolves, how our tax dollars are spent, how our children are cared for and educated. What’s done in the dark, they bring to the light, often at a fair amount of personal and professional risk.
 Readers can hold journalists accountable, too. If you disagree or find error in some Washington Post story, the odds are low that the reporter will ever hear your complaint. However, if I get something wrong, you can bend my ear at Kroger or write your own letter to the editor.
 Though internet content may be free, and it may be more to your liking, there is far less accountability. As I’ve written here before, an online article with no date, no byline, is a red flag. Even if you find the author, they might not be who they say they are, and there’s likely no way to find out who’s paying them. It’s highly likely that all they wanted from you was a click, anyway.

Many believe that a new era of oppression is being rolled out, right now as we sit in our homes, enabled by the high-power, high-speed and low latency 5G network, worldwide by a hidden agency. Conspiracies aside, there are many questions to be asked about our rights, what our freedoms should consist of and what the limits of government and corporate actions should be. We need to ask those questions, we need to demand answers and show the ‘powers that be’ that the thirst for true democracy is still alive and kicking. If we volunteer to be imprisoned or to become our own jailers then there is no hope for humanity. As in the past, humanity needs to assert itself in order to remain free of despotism and it has never been more urgent than now. Corny as it may be, the simplest way to express this is for me to repeat the words of the late Bob Marley -- “Get up, stand up, stand up for your rights!”
