As I helped a young woman complete her voter’s registration, she told me she wanted to vote for Measure 109 because two of her friends had died from using shrooms (psilocybin mushrooms) sprayed with fentanyl. Dealers of street drugs, like cigarette companies, add addictive substances to encourage return customers — which works, except when customers die.
 Criminalizing drugs only contributes to the problem. It discourages medical communities from exploring how drugs might benefit patients, and it encourages some from marginalized, poorer communities to engage in criminal behavior to profit from supplying drugs people can’t find elsewhere.
 Ironically, the decision to engage in a “war on drugs” was made by the Nixon administration wanting an excuse to arrest those protesting the carpet bombing of Cambodia — just as research was discovering the therapeutic benefits of using psychotropic drugs. Because I had the good fortune to be involved in early government-funded tests with psilocybin, conducted by Dr. Roland Fischer at Ohio State, I feel honored to share with readers what I learned.
 First, psilocybin’s value in helping alcoholics overcome addiction was already known. told us that tests with Native American males chronically addicted to alcohol, psilocybin provided the most effective cure. Consider people, separated from a heritage of tribal rituals using psychedelic drugs in spiritual ceremonies uniting the tribe, having only alcohol as a means to alter their mental state to achieve the same results. Dr. Fischer told us: when psilocybin presented them with a spiritual experience they couldn’t achieve with alcohol, they were willing to stop drinking.
 As for my own experience, psilocybin allowed me to rise above the constant chatter in my mind. It released me from preconceived notions that distorted how I viewed the world around me. This became most obvious when, having finished our series of tests with Dr. Fischer, we were offered a tour of the hospital building by the monitors paid to watch over us. They led us into a room where experimental animals were sitting in individual cages with electrodes implanted in their skulls. Perhaps our monitors wanted to freak us out; instead we eyed them with compassion. Here were animals as vital, lonely, and frightened as people would be in their circumstance. From there, we took an escalator down to lobby of the hospital, where families had brought their children in for treatment. Behind the brave faces we saw their vulnerability. Our empathy for others increased. After this experiment, I ceased to take myself so seriously. I allowed humor and a sense of irony to balance my life.
 Now that our war on drugs has caused more trouble than it’s worth, we are again, considering whether drugs like psilocybin might provide relief to those suffering ailments of addiction, depression, and end-of-life anxiety. Friends of mine living in Denver tell me one of the benefits of legalizing marijuana has been that students look at drug use more critically. Smoking pot lost its cache as a form of protest. Legalization has tended to take drugs off the streets.
 I can understand why law enforcement organizations might oppose Measure 109 because they want to arrest dealers, but nothing in this would affect that. But I disagree with the position taken by The Bulletin, saying “we don’t see the advantage to Oregon being out in front of the rest of the nation.” Do you really prefer the status quo—where suicide has become the leading cause of death for Oregon teenagers? Are we to accept the massive addiction to opioids and anti-depressants among those suffering from PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. Should we turn a blind eye to young people dying from overdoses of fentanyl? Other states would benefit if Oregon would take the lead on this issue. Vote “Yes” on Measure 109!

Pep Guardiola ruled out ever taking charge of Barcelona for a second spell as the Manchester City boss insisted he retains the “desire” to succeed in England.
 Guardiola is the most decorated coach in Barca’s glorious history after winning 14 trophies in four years in charge between 2008 and 2012.
 Josep Maria Bartomeu finally bowed to pressure to resign as president of the Catalan giants this week, with one of the leading candidates to take over, Victor Font, saying he wants to bring legends like Guardiola and his former players Xavi and Carles Puyol back to work for the club.
 “I said many times, my period as a manager in Barcelona is over. I think in life there is once you have to do things,” Guardiola said after City’s 1-0 win over Sheffield United on Saturday.
 “There are incredible people who can be in charge, now for example (Barcelona coach) Ronald Koeman is an excellent manager. It is over.”
 A boyhood Barca fan, Guardiola also enjoyed an illustrious playing career at the Camp Nou and still holds season tickets as a supporter.
 “I will come back to my seats to see my club to watch a game. I am incredibly happy here, still I have the desire to do well and this is the most important thing.
 “Now there will be elections in Barcelona. Hopefully, they can choose the right board to maintain this incredible club Barcelona at the highest level.”
 Guardiola is already into the longest managerial spell of his career with this his fifth season at City.
 His side still look a long way off the heights they reached in winning back- to-back Premier League titles between 2017 and 2019, but they are slowly getting up to speed after a start to the campaign disrupted by injuries, coronavirus cases and just a two-week-long pre-season.
 Kyle Walker’s long-range effort against his former club was enough to secure City’s fourth win in five games in all competitions as they move up to seventh in the Premier League, just two points off the top.
 Without a natural striker due to injuries to Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, City struggled to turn their dominance into goals at Bramall Lane.
 “We played really well,” added Guardiola. “We struggled to score goals for the chances we created, 16 shots, eight on target, is a lot against this team.”
 Aaron Ramsdale was busy in the Blades’ goal as he twice denied Ferran Torres from close range, while he unconvincingly parried Rodrigo’s long-range effort behind.
 Walker finally broke the deadlock from similar range on 28 minutes as his shot arrowed low past Ramsdale’s right-hand, but there was a muted celebration from the England international against his boyhood club.
 “My mum and dad live here, so if I’d celebrated I’d have got a lot of stick,” said Walker. “I’m a Sheffield United fan, so I couldn’t celebrate.”
 Kevin De Bruyne flashed a shot wide following another attacking burst from Walker early in the second-half before Ramsdale produced his best save of the game from Riyad Mahrez’s free-kick.
 However, City’s failure to kill off the game gave Chris Wilder’s men chances to snatch an unlikely point.
 John Lundstram had the best chance for the hosts when he side-footed Sander Berge’s low cross over.
 But Sheffield United have still scored just three goals in seven games to start the season and remain second bottom on just one point.

RR and Stokes have more pressing matters at hand on Sunday, when they take on KKR. Even a win might not be sufficent for either teams to get to the playoffs, because of their poor run-rate.
 RR will hope they beat KKR, while CSK get the better of Kings XI Punjab in the first game on Sunday. That still might not be enough as RR will then need Mumbai Indians to do them a favour by beating SunRisers Hyderabad on Tuesday.

Cui and Chu note that polypropylene will lose its electrostatic charge when you wash it, but you can recharge it by ironing it or by rubbing it with a plastic glove for around 20 seconds. Once you've got static cling, ka-ching — you're back in business. Cui says a two-layer tight-weave cotton mask alone can filter out about 35% of small particles. But adding a filter made out of two layers of charged polypropylene could boost that filtration efficiency by as much as another 35%, Cui says. You still want a cotton layer closest to your face, he says, because it's a more comfortable material.

by Tom Stimson
    Originally published in the March 2011 edition of The Stimson Group’s AV Matters newsletter.
 In the February 2011 issue of Building Connections the official newsletter of NSCA, Chuck Wilson penned an insightful letter to his members. The title says it all, "Ten Reasons You're Not Profitable, and 10 Ways to Change That." Chuck's audience is integrators and contractors, but this list applies to all of my readers (and probably more so to Rental-Stagers). Read on to learn why.   In his article, Chuck has captured the contrast between managers that blame the world around them for changing the rules of the game and those that see change coming and respond to it.  
 He begins by listing ten qualities he sees in companies that struggle with profitability. There's a consistent pattern of justifying the status quo through isolationist posturing and self-denial. What has happened - in a nutshell - is that the microeconomic factors that affect our industry have changed and many, many companies either did not recognize the shift or didn't respond appropriately.  
 I work with a lot of companies and the most difficult attitude to overcome is "If we don't drop our price, we won't win the job." When I ask, what's the bottom limit to price? No one seems to know the answer, or how to consistently calculate it. We live in a price-driven world, but I like to remind my clients that they are not negotiating price, they are negotiating profit. Managers must understand where the profit comes from, so they can tell the sales folks what the lowest acceptable profit is. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter what other companies are willing to charge; you need to sell at a profit. Unfortunately, too many of the businesses in our industry either don't have the data to analyze or do not understand what their numbers are telling them.
 Benchmarking is an excellent way to uncover clues about how to manage your business, which is Chuck's point. However, if your data is not properly collected then you will benchmark the wrong numbers and draw the wrong conclusions. For example, managers often focus on gross profit by job or month. In my experience of reviewing scores of AV industry financial statements, I have not found two companies that measure gross profit in exactly the same way. Benchmarking works best when you analyze related sets of data (I feel another article coming on....). This is not necessarily intuitive and is why outside advisors (accountants, bankers, consultants) are important for your business.
 Moving on to the qualities that fit the positive side of Chuck's list, we see more than just the flip side where proactive companies follow metrics, benchmark, and walk away from bad business. Chuck describes a culture where managers are involved in decision-making, financial terms are mission- critical, and strategic thinking is applied. However, adapting the practices in the "profitable" list aren't necessarily enough if your assumptions are wrong.
 Which brings me to Chuck's final teaching point about the observation that big companies get their price advantage from buying more product. He's right; they do not. Big companies may buy products for less than smaller competitors, but in general their costs and overhead are lower as a percentage of revenue because at some point "scale" kicks in. When you realize that you can do twice as much business with the same overhead costs, why wouldn't you take timely projects at lower margins? In other words, every opportunity needs to be evaluated based on timing, strategy, and potential profit together.
 The best business decisions do not follow straightforward rules. Managers should be guided by a matrix of variables that lead to the best decision at this moment. That decision is why managers exist.
 In my opinion, the reason lack of profitability has become pandemic is that the industry in general focuses too much on the outside factors that explain current conditions and not enough on the internal response to those circumstances. The basic rules for running a good business have not changed: Know your costs, balance your resources, and differentiate your services. What has changed is the margin for error. The lesson from Chuck's insightful article is in essence, that companies are in charge of their destinies, the tools for better decisions are available, and poor profits are a lagging indicator of poor management.

A community that has fewer than one daily new case per 100,000 is green. One to 9 is yellow; between 10 and 24 is orange; and 25 and above puts you in the red. "When you get into that orange and red zone it means, in all likelihood, you're seeing a lot of velocity, a kind of fast upward trend," Allen says.

Randy Wayne Hundl August 12, 1962 - October 3, 2020 Dripping Springs, TX It is with devastated, broken hearts, that we have to say goodbye way too early, to our larger than life father, husband, son, brother, uncle, and friend Randy Wayne Hundl. Born August 12, 1962 in Houston, Texas to Delphin and Estella Hundl, Randy passed away October 3, 2020, at his home in Dripping Springs, Texas. Randy grew up in Houston, attending Pilgrim Elementary School, T.H. Rogers Junior High School, and Robert E. Lee High School. He graduated from Texas State Technical Institute with and Associate Science Degree majoring in Aircraft Pilot Training (Certified Flight Instructor) which was a short-lived endeavor when he discovered he was colorblind. He changed gears and drank the Aggie Kool Aid (Much to his two Longhorn sisters' disapproval) graduating from Texas A&amp;M University with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Industrial Education, even though he was already full of, and had the gift of BS. With that gift and his vivacious, outgoing personality, he had a successful career as a salesman. He worked throughout college at Montgomery Ward and Foley's selling electronics. After College he had a successful career as salesman and manager for Air Products &amp; Chemicals, Pulse Electronics, Exar, and Max Linear, Inc. throughout the United Sates while residing in San Diego, CA and then Dripping Springs, TX. A successful career man no doubt, Oh but there is SO MUCH MORE!!Please visit Randy's online memorial tribute at www.greencremationtexas.com/obits where memories and words of comfort and condolences may be shared electronically with his loved ones.
