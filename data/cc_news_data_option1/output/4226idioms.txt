DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors plans to spend $2 billion to convert its Spring Hill, Tennessee, assembly plant into a third U.S. site to build future electric vehicles.

Reform-minded prosecutors are now cautiously testing this approach in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, and elsewhere. Restorative justice is not easy to put into practice, because our entire legal system is based on the idea that for every crime there must be a punishment. And what is that but, writ large, the age-old human thirst for revenge?

But the murderer was already behind bars. “The state boys got him.” That left Eric and his friends even angrier. “So you want to rumble, but there ain’t nobody to rumble with. I feel like I want my quart of blood. I deserve to get some revenge. _Her_ kids deserve not to cry. _His_ kids deserve to cry too. _His_ mom should be feeling the same thing my mom’s feeling right now.”

“I don’t agree with all the burning and looting but I think it is about time that we do have equality in this country,” he said. “And especially in the Black Lives Matter Movement, let’s not get lost on what we’re there for, peaceful protesting for equality.”

Some of the work Eric does is on the fly, as with Andre and Anthony. But he also holds scheduled talks with groups of students. At one, he asks, “How many know someone who’s been in jail?” Almost all kids raise a hand. “How many know someone who’s been murdered?” About half put a hand up. In another session, he spends an hour with 17 boys whom he seats in a circle. “As adults,” Eric says to the boys, “we haven’t given you reason to trust us.”

When I checked back in a few months later, Eric was feeling more optimistic that the teachers he was working with were starting to “get it.” Not long after that, however, COVID forced schools everywhere, including Hudson middle school, to go online. By that point, however, there was already one sign of his impact: referrals from Hudson to Selma’s juvenile court system had dropped sharply. The principal says they’ve cut back on paddling, and no longer make kids face the wall when being disciplined. Eric has been busy during the virus shutdown consulting with school principals in different cities, but “most of the work I was doing in Selma was face to face, and almost has to be face to face.” Once things are back to normal, the nonprofits funding him and Mark plan to have them train others in restorative justice practices—and to expand that work to other schools, including the city’s high school.

Last week, the Johnson County Board of County Commissioners authorized a series of bond sales to refinance existing debt, saving nearly $6.5 million in taxpayer dollars. The board refinanced bond sales in light of current lower market interest rates.

Students say “No, sir,” and “Yes, ma’am,” and if Eric introduces himself to a teacher and asks her name, it will be “Ms. Thomas.” He cuts a very different figure. Cruising the hallways, with his earrings, baseball cap, sneakers, and Beats headphones pumping a mix of Stevie Wonder and ’90s R&B, he calls out to students and gives them hugs, fist bumps, high-fives. “Don’t ‘yes, sir’ me. My name’s Eric!” “How y’doing, cousin!…My _man_!…How’s my homie?…What do you wanna be when you grow up? Maybe I’ll tell you what I want to be when _I_ grow up!” Sometimes he’ll roll up his sleeve and show off his tattoo: “Find Something Truly Worth Dying For And Live For It.” This is only his second week at Hudson, and the teachers are clearly not sure what to make of him.

The three-member committee’s initial mandate was of one month, which was subsequently extended indefinitely. In the committee’s last meeting held on October 15, the PTI had committed to responding to its queries regarding evidence on alleged illegal funding from the US.
 The committee was reassigned by the ECP through its order of August 27 2020 to conduct scrutiny afresh and complete it in six weeks, ending on October 22, 2020. Its earlier repor submitted on August 17, 2020 was rejected by ECP for lack of credibility and transparency. Since then, the committee has met on a few occasions with little progress to report.
 It is expected the committee will approach the Election Commission for further instructions after expiry of yet another deadline of October 22, 2020. Instead of verifying the evidence on its own account, it was learnt that the committee in its last meeting of October 15 had presented the details of illegal funding downloaded from the US Department of Justice to PTI, asking the accused to verify the evidence against it. Whereas, the ECP in its order of August 27, 2020 had ordered that it was the committee’s duty and responsibility to scrutinize the authenticity and reliability and credibility of each and every document submitted by both parties and after proper scrutiny of documents.
 It is understood that since there are piles of evidence to verify, it appears impossible for the committee to complete a detailed and comprehensive scrutiny of PTI foreign funding evidence by October 22 as directed by the ECP and yet another extension in the deadline is on the cards.

The boys nod. Eric asks each about the other, “What’s his name?” They respond with first names only. Eric says, “I want first _and_ last names…You gotta _know_ each other, man, instead of fighting. Instead of being punished, we’re gonna learn how to talk to each other. What I see is two Black men. We fight each other over and over again. And at the end of the day we can’t even say what it was about.”

Plans to develop a residential project in West Jackson got the green light this week.
 The Jackson County Board of Commissioners voted Monday, Oct. 19, to approve a rezoning and special use request for Ray Vaughn for 44.5 acres off Jackson Trail Rd. near the intersection of Marshall Clark Rd. The property backs up to the Traditions subdivision.
 Vaughn requested an R-1 zoning and a special use for a master planned development.

However, it wouldn’t be the first time that Voyager 2 entered the heliosphere, apparently, Voyager 1 made it to the edge of the heliosphere in 2012 as it conducted two probes to help scientists understand how far this boundary was located from the sun. Although, many such key details had remained a mystery. The two probes were held at Sun’s period of high and low activity, with a difference of approximately 11-year solar cycle. While Voyager-1 had exited the heliopause, an edge of heliosphere known to the scientists, Voyager-2 didn’t exit the undisturbed interstellar space amid the probe. “Voyager 2 appears to be in a perturbed transitional region just beyond the heliosphere,” NASA informed, indicating that the spacecraft had reached beyond Pluto.

Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden's running mate Kamala Harris broke into a little dance in the rain and the Twitter users can not keep calm. From calling it the "best thing on the internet" to saying that's "what a boss looks like", the short clip showing Harris grooving while holding an umbrella has taken the internet by storm. Saying "rain or shine", democracy doesn't wait for anyone, the California Senator was captured thoroughly enjoying while light dancing in front of the voters in Florida on October 20. She herself shared her image from the campaign rally where the supporters were also seen enjoying the music.

Corporal punishment is legal in Alabama public schools, as it is in 18 other states, mostly in the South. To Eric, this echoes the days of slavery. “It’s on your backside. You have to turn your back to the person that’s disciplining you. You don’t get to look at them. It’s a shaming process. And more often than not, it’s done in front of others” to make them think, “What could happen to me if I get out of line? That was the slave master’s idea of how to maintain control. And it’s the exact same idea in the schools. We’re not really trying to teach. We’re trying to _maintain control_. But the real message is, ‘I’m doing this because I’m angry.’”

Forse, in questo caso, la pezza messa dalla Lualdi e stata peggio del buco. Va bene la diretta, ma una gaffe a sfondo razzista ai danni una collaboratrice domestica, anche se riferito a tanti anni fa, non e proprio il massimo. E di certo il pubblico di "Oggi e un altro giorno" avra apprezzato la presa di posizione della sua beniamina Serena Bortone. Sempre attenta che il linguaggio dei suoi ospiti non scivoli verso il trash ed il volgare. Ormai la conosciamo bene.
