It is almost a consensus that the broadcast deals that provide the money that sustain the majority of the top flight sporting events can only be fulfilled if the remaining games for the season are completed, even if it means taking them behind closed doors. Because of that, the ECB has been instructed by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to study the viability of this option for all high profile sports including football, so as to share and implement it according to the results of the research. However, it is not all doom and gloom because even if this is the case, as sports fans we will still be able to bet on the fixtures and watch them. Nowadays you can watch live cricket on most betting websites through their streaming services. Here you can find some reliable UK options where you can sign up for free.

The city of Enterprise is getting ready to reopen after state-mandated closures over the COVID-19 pandemic, as the city council held its last virtual meeting Monday, May 11 and made plans to support businesses to reopen under Gov. Kate Brown’s most recent executive order.
 City Hall’s doors will again be open to the public beginning Monday, May 18, although a budget committee meeting schedule for tonight will still be virtual.
 “However, we will closely monitor the visitors in order to maintain social distancing and keep our staff safe,” said Lacey McQuead, city administrator.
 She said one person will be allowed in the foyer at a time with others asked to wait outside for their turn. One-on-one meetings must be prescheduled. Customers are urged to either use the drop box outside City Hall or to pay online.
 The council also approved letting food service-related businesses to place tables and chairs on sidewalks in front of their restaurants. No special permits are needed, McQuead said.
 “We want to get businesses back up and running,” she said.
 Under Brown’s order, restaurants may allow inside seating as long as social distancing is maintained. The sidewalk tables would allow for more customers at acceptable distances.
 The city will require the restaurants to have their own garbage cans available to patrons who choose to eat outside.
 In another matter, Council President Jenni Word was voted mayor pro-tem effective June 1 through the end of the year as Mayor Stacey Karvoski stepped down. Karvoski is moving outside Enterprise city limits, meaning she no longer qualifies to serve as a public official with the city.
 McQuead said that in July, she will begin advertising for anyone interested in running for mayor in November. A candidate must file by Aug. 25. A new mayor will be sworn in Jan. 10, at which time Word will revert to her position on the council.
 The council honored Karvoski for her 11 years of service both as a councilwoman from 2009 and as mayor since 2017. McQuead read a letter noting the many committees Karvoski has served on, expressed the council’s appreciation and presented her with a plaque.
 “You are being honored with much appreciation and gratitude,” McQuead told the outgoing mayor. “We will miss you.”
 Council members agreed.
 “It’s nice to have someone on council who’s not there for their own personal agenda but to serve the public,” Councilman Larry Christman said.
 Also, Dr. Kenneth Rose, of Wallowa Memorial Hospital, proposed creating a community garden on hospital property with water supplied by the city. Numerous questions were raised, including that of the cost to the city, which will be explored jointly by the city’s Parks Committee and Rose. McQuead said she would organize a meeting within the next week.

Many of the Kem Kem fossils date back to the Cretaceous period, but there is disparity among researchers about when certain species would have been around so long ago. According to the paper, some believe that the fossils "as a whole represent a 'compound assemblage' derived from two formations or from disparate paleoenvironments."
 Still, one thing researchers do agree on is that the Kem Kem collection is one of the most comprehensive groups of fossils to come out Africa.  
 The paper point out that "the Kem Kem vertebrate assemblage...captures the taxonomic diversity of a widespread northern African fauna better than any other contemporary assemblage from elsewhere [on the continent]."

We are all pulling at our tethers. Fettered, hobbled, and haltered by the coronavirus, we are beginning to rear back against our restraints. The sun is shining, the grass is green. Winter is past. We yearn to be free. We pray for a return to “normal.” In the space of two months our lives have changed into a sort of fairy tale, and not a good one. We want to share our lives, our meals, and our joys with loved ones. But there is a wolf outside our door.
 Just as we wish to do, Little Red Riding Hood set off on a mission to help her ailing and frail grandmother, to bring food and companionship to a frail loved one. Along the way, she met a wolf who beguilingly distracted her, suggesting she pick flowers and take those to her grandmother, too. Little Red Riding Hood did not recognize the danger the wolf presented. And so while she was picking a nice bouquet, the wolf ran ahead, ate her grandmother, dressed in her clothes and climbed into her bed to await the girl’s arrival.
 When the girl arrived at the cabin with food and flowers, the awkwardly disguised wolf lay in wait. Little Red Riding Hood repeatedly observed things that were suspicious: What big ears you have. What big eyes you have. But she failed to recognize the threat, and although she questioned the unusual visage of her “grandmother” she continued to ignore the clear evidence of a threat, recognizing only what she expected to see in a normal world—a grandmother—and not the wolf. What long whiskers you have. What big hands you have; and finally, of course, what big teeth you have. At which point the wolf revealed his true nature and gobbled her up.
 We face equal peril. Like the compassionate and well-meaning girl in the story, we want to help our neighbors, our family, and our community. We want to see them prosper. But in a tourism-based economy, we cannot bear the whole burden of community prosperity on our own.
 We have already seen out-of-state plates, people posing in front of statues in Joseph, and people heading into the store in maskless splendor from their Washington or Idaho or Utah plated vehicles. We are torn between embracing them and rejecting them, even running away. They seem friendly enough, but they might have invisible whiskers, big ears, and, yes, big teeth.
 Like the wolf, COVID-19 has no intention of mercy. Wise medical minds have warned us of a second wave in the fall. Physicians have pointed out that isolation and social distance are essential to halt the spread. We are learning that children are susceptible to insidious variations of the disease, and that COVID-19 strikes at much more than just our lungs. We know this disease is remarkably contagious.
 Phased opening is the most logical and strategic way to go. It lets us check the whiskers, the nose, and the ears before we notice how big Grandma’s teeth are. Had Little Red Riding Hood taken heed of the signs that all was not “normal,” she would have avoided being devoured.
 We can too. But it requires self-discipline. Following the governor’s guidelines for opening will let us recognize any resurgence of the wolf, whether whiskers, ears, or even teeth. In the end, it’s the best way to ensure community prosperity.

How long must Erie County continue to wait for a development plan for a brick- and-mortar community college? Local career training and local workforce development are needed for the next generation and future economy of Erie.
   
 I had the advantage of attending and graduating from my community college in 1975 with an associate degree in nursing. My college experience was valuable, and I received excellent training and preparation for my career as a staff and charge nurse. I was surprised when I moved to Erie in 1989 that no community college existed here.
   
 Tuition at community colleges is an affordable alternative to for-profit colleges. I paid my tuition by working as a nurse's assistant and owed nothing and graduated debt-free.
   
 Meanwhile, in my opinion, the unaccredited Northern Pennsylvania Regional College has been attempting and failing to meet the educational needs of local students while diverting public funding to their video classroom college. Most of their students are high school students in surrounding counties while Erie- area high school students are already able to earn transferable college credits from local accredited regional universities.
   
 We need community leaders who represent the interests of Erie County to approve and develop a standalone community college in Erie that meets the requirements for classroom instruction.
   
 Erie County has met the requirements to establish a community college. It is past time for a final hearing before the state Board of Education. Until then, Erie County remains the largest municipality in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania without development of a community college that educates and values the future of local students and the future prosperity of Erie.

 Our county executive has again demonstrated her lack of qualifications to manage Erie County as we recover from the economic problems. On Monday, May 4, she announced concern about the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. She concluded they must be caused by increased group activity on the weekend.
   
 She expressed that the increase would require a return to "red status." COVID-19 cases take many days to test positive. The increase in exposure was clearly spread over many days. On Tuesday, May 5, she announced that we would need many more cases to change our status.
   
 Where did she get the new opinion? These people should control the "message" and avoid the confusion.
   
 There are a number of businesses that have remained open as "essential." The information on how these places have remained open provides data to permit all businesses to open.
   
 It is likely that having all people wear masks and avoiding all close group activity works to limit the virus. Any location with a senior population must remain protected. Restaurants, barbershops and small retail locations should be open with simple procedures.
   
 It is not necessary to wait for the governor to dictate every decision for Erie County.

 We'll beat COVID-19 with
   
 science, not division
   
 A recent news photo captured unruly protesters sporting Trump hats rushing the doors of the Ohio state Capitol, whining about feeling too constrained during the effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. With screaming mouths agape and spittle flying, the image is a terrifying evocation of apocalyptic Trump zombies, ignorantly threatening to spread their disease, separated from us by only glass.
   
 President Donald Trump called them "very responsible people" and promptly tweeted for his supporters to "LIBERATE!" the states of Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia, adding that Virginia's gun-toting citizens' "2nd Amendment rights are under siege!" After all, what good is a call for "liberation" without firepower?
   
 Trump's apparent strategy is to continue to gaslight America and to promote idiotic "disinfectant" remedies, all while simultaneously inciting public mutiny and turning his most fervent supporters into "Branch Covidians" by proffering magic elixirs.
   
 While Trump stokes the clamor to succumb to greed, his administration has had the foresight to place an order for 100,000 body bags. Yeah, that sign is flashing at you!
   
 A clear majority of Americans want to stay the course and to ramp up testing and tracking as we prepare to reopen business. It is un-American to selfishly flout sensible, science-based guidelines just so Trump's minion minority can romp on the beach as the president orchestrates Blue Angels flyovers. Real patriots must refute these reckless attempts to bully the nation into abandoning the effort prematurely.
   
 We must stop the insanity now! Call, text or email your congressman or senator today.

 A pair of Fort Smith-area preps standouts who later played at the University of Arkansas will be advancing as part of an online contest.
 Martine Bercher, a 1960s football standout for the Razorbacks, and Connor Noland, currently a pitcher for the Razorback baseball team, were the latest winners of the opening round Twitter polls as part of the voting to determine the Greatest All-Time Athlete from the Fort Smith Area.
 Bercher won his poll pitting four random athletes by garnering 55.2 percent of the vote.
 A 1962 graduate of St. Anne's High School, where he was part of the Buffaloes' legendary gridiron tradition in that era as well as playing basketball and baseball, Bercher found even more success when he went to Arkansas.
 Primarily a safety who also returned punts, Bercher was part of the Razorbacks' 1964 national championship squad.
 But he really made quite a name for himself two years later, in 1966. Bercher was named to the All-American team after recording 30 tackles and intercepting three passes on defense.
 In addition that season, he led the Southwest Conference with 375 punt return yards.
 Bercher was drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the sixth round of the 1967 NFL Draft. He spent one season with the Falcons and the 1968 season playing for the Minnesota Vikings.
 Finishing second in the poll behind Bercher was former Alma standout athlete Dallas Smith, who had 27.1 percent of the votes. Smith played both football and basketball for the Airedales.
 Former Northside football standout Benny Shepherd, who was part of the Grizzlies' memorable 1967 state title team and later went on to play at Arkansas Tech, placed third with 10.4 percent of the vote, while former Southside football standout Chase Pressley was fourth with 7.3 percent.
 Noland won his respective four-person random poll by generating 46.5 percent of the vote.
 He was one of the state's top athletes in the last decade playing both football and baseball at Greenwood. As a quarterback, Noland threw for 5,768 yards and 61 touchdowns in his career with the Bulldogs, and capped it with a 13-0 record and the 6A state title in 2017.
 Then in baseball, Noland recorded a 0.45 earned-run average his final two seasons pitching for the Bulldogs. In his senior season, 2018, he did not allow a run over his last eight starts, including pitching a shutout to win the 6A state championship.
 Noland signed to play both baseball and football at Arkansas. After seeing some action at quarterback for the Razorbacks in 2018, Noland has now shifted his focus to the diamond. As a freshman, he was named to the Southeastern Conference's All-Freshman team and was 2-0 this season before it was shut down.
 Another Razorback finished second behind Noland, as former Spiro player Anthony Eubanks finished with 21.7 percent of the vote in a close race. Eubanks went on to play receiver at Arkansas in the late 1990s and had nearly 2,500 yards in his career with the Razorbacks.
 Eubanks edged out former Booneville standout Trey Holloway for second.
 Holloway, who won state as both a football and baseball player for the Bearcats, ended up with 21.2 percent of the votes. He went on to play baseball at Arkansas and later ended up coaching Noland as Greenwood's baseball coach.
 Fourth place in the poll was former Roland standout Austin Cantrell with 10.6 percent. Cantrell excelled in both football and track for the Rangers and also ended up at Arkansas, playing mainly tight end.
 The Greatest All-Time Athlete from the Fort Smith Area continues with its opening-round Twitter polls pitting four random athletes against one another. Those can be found on the Times Record's Twitter page.
 Both poll winners and runners-up will move on to the 64-person second round which will be unveiled at a later date.
