ELDRIDGE — North Scott head coach Kevin Tippet said at the beginning of the season he felt his team could be pretty scary by October.
 The Lancers certainly terrorized Clinton.
 North Scott dominated both sides of the ball Friday night, rolling to a 50-0 win at Lancer Stadium, sending North Scott into the postseason at 4-1. North Scott scored on every possession except for the final one of the night and the defense posted its third shutout of the season.
 Still, due in part to a two-week hiatus after a COVID-19 scare in the high school, Tippet feels the Lancers still have plenty of work left to do.

Before the likes of West Side star Dana Evans came around, it was Angela Hamblin who starred in the Steel City.


  One of the greatest female players in Region history, Hamblin was a mega-star at now-defunct Lew Wallace. She finished her career with 2,053 career points. In her senior year, she averaged 26.2 points, 18 rebounds, 5.3 steals and two blocks a game. She finished third in the voting for Miss Basketball and was an Indiana All-Star.


  She continued her basketball career at the University of Iowa, where she was an All Big-Ten player and earned Big Ten Tournament MVP honors her junior year.


  Hamblin was drafted in the third round (23rd overall) by the Washington Mystics in the 1998 WNBA Draft. She was waived by the Mystics on June 10, 1998, and signed by the Detroit Shock on July 18 of that same year. Hamblin played six games for the Shock that season and was waived on May 6, 1999. She also played semipro ball until an Achilles heel injury several years ago ended her playing days.


  She returned to coach at Lew Wallace in 2005 before winding up at Lake Central High School, after leaving Glen Park in 2009. She was part of the L.C. coaching staff that won the 2011 sectional championship.


  As of 2014, Hamblin lived in Gary. She has two daughters, who are also talented players.

The son of former basketball star Glenn Robinson has made a name for himself in the same sport as his father.


  He even did something pops never could: Win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.


  A late bloomer who was a junior varsity player as a freshman at Lake Central, "Trey" emerged the following season, when he led the Indians in scoring. By his senior year, which saw Lake Central capture a sectional title, he had developed into a top recruit. He led Lake Central to a sectional title and chose to continue the region pipeline by committing to Michigan.


  In his two seasons in Ann Arbor, the Wolverines enjoyed unprecedented success, winning 59 games in the span. One of three Northwest Indiana players on the UM roster, Robinson shined on the national stage, playing a key role in a run to the 2013 national championship game, where Michigan fell to Louisville. His stock rose to the point that he was projected to be a first- round draft pick, but he chose to return for his sophomore season.


  The Wolverines reached the 2014 regional final, falling to Kentucky, and the 6-foot-7 Robinson declared for the draft. He was taken 40th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, but played sparingly and was waived late in his rookie year.


  Philadelphia claimed Robinson two days after and he finished the season there, making his first professional start in the season finale. The 76ers didn't make him a qualifying offer and Robinson became a free agent. He played in the summer league with Atlanta, eventually singing a three-year contract to play back in his home state with the Indiana Pacers for just over $1 million per season.


  Robinson entered the starting lineup in 2016, then became a national star in February when he claimed the NBA Slam Dunk championship.


  He briefly played for the Detroit Pistons during the 2018-19 season before becoming a free agent and signing with the Golden State Warriors. He has started all 25 games he's played in and is averaging a career-high 11.5 points and 4.7 rebounds per game.

On a practical note, a small PST wouldn’t balance Alberta’s budget. A general rule of thumb is that a PST would generate about $1 billion in government revenue for every one percentage point increase. So, to wipe out this year’s $24-billion deficit, Kenney would need to impose a 24 per cent PST. And even that wouldn’t balance the books as the crippling tax would send Albertans, and our tax dollars, fleeing for greener pastures.

The Gordon Central Warriors were beat black and blue in Blue Ridge on Friday night after a trip to take on the Fannin County Rebels ended with a 57-6 loss.


  The Warriors not only failed to slow down the Rebel offense but also sabotaged their own chances by turning the ball over four times (two fumbles, two interceptions) on the opponent's half of the field.


  The Rebel offense set the tone on their first play of the game with an 55-yard touchdown pass from Luke Holloway to Jalen Ingram. Then their defense forced a quick three-and-out from Gordon Central before their special teams blocked the Warrior punt and returned the loose ball for another touchdown. With the extra points tacked on, Fannin County was up 14-0.


  Gordon Central went three and out on their next possession, and then Fannin put together a steady drive that ended with a nine-yard touchdown run from Carter Mann.


  The Warriors' third possession saw the team record three first downs while driving downfield before a bobbled pitch from Tre Williams hit the turf and was scooped up by the Rebels. Gordon Central defender Brock Shellhouse recorded a big sack on Fannin's following possession, but then Holloway connected with Andre Bivens for a 56-yard touchdown. A successful extra point pushed the score to 28-0.


  On their next two possessions Fannin added two more scores with a pair of 35-yard touchdown passes to Cohutta Hyde, knocking the score up to 42-0.


  Then Bivens, playing on the defensive side of the ball, picked off a Gordon Central pass and returned it to the Warriors' five-yard-line. Their offense pounded in the final score of the half one play later and set the score at 49-0.


  Gordon Central's Brison McGinnis had a big play on the Warriors' following possession, and a Sean Gray run set the team up in the red zone, but then the Rebels nabbed another interception, this time on their own 10-yard line, ending the drive before running out the clock.


  The third quarter brought a running clock and a slew of back up players for Fannin County. And while Gordon Central was the only team to run an offensive play in the third quarter, the Rebels still scored eight points after returning a fumble for a touchdown and converting a two-point conversion to make the score 57-0.


  Warriors running back Jordan Boone tacked on the only Gordon Central points of the night on the first play in the fourth quarter, but a missed extra point left the final score of 57-6.


  The Fannin County back-ups managed a couple of first downs, including a converted fourth down attempt, before fumbling the ball to Gordon Central. The Warriors then completed one big pass before taking a last-second shot in the end zone that fell incomplete.


  Gordon Central (1-4) are off next week. They'll host the Pepperell Dragons on Oct. 23 at 7:30 p.m.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) – Unforced errors. Lost fumbles. Missed tackles. Penalties. A targeting ejection. Giving up a 19-yard touchdown pass on third and goal to surrender the fourth-quarter lead.


  You name it, the University of Louisville football team piled it up in Friday night’s 46-27 loss to Georgia Tech at Bobby Dodd Stadium.


  Call it what you want, but it was a pile of something. Louisville had a 14-point lead in the first half. With 9 minutes to go in the game, the Cardinals led by 1 point and were driving near midfield. But Scott Satterfield's team melted down from that point on, giving up up 3 touchdowns in the final 8:40.


  Now, after its worst loss of the young Satterfield era, Louisville has a fight on its hands to keep its season from slipping away.


  Louisville controlled the line of scrimmage Friday. It just couldn’t control its own mistakes. Three Cardinal turnovers led to 19 Georgia Tech points, and negated what good things they was able to do on both sides of the ball.


  As a result, the Cardinals come home with a 1-3 record — 0-3 in the Atlantic Coast Conference — with the schedule showing a trip to No. 5 Notre Dame next week.


  "They did an excellent job of stripping the football," Satterfield said after the game. "We've obviously got to do a better job of hanging onto the ball. That resulted in 19 points. I think it's one of the things you've got to get better at. We had the lead at 21-6 and a huge play in the game when they hit a screen right before the half and got the ball down the field and scored a couple of plays later. I thought that was a huge point in the game. Then they get the ball back after halftime."


  Georgia Tech took an early 7-0 lead after a Hassan Hall fumble on Louisville’s first possession. Despite all the mistakes, however, Louisville was in the game and looked as if it might get some kind of control with a 27-26 lead and driving near midfield early in the fourth quarter. Then, a Javian Hawkins fumble gave Georgia Tech good field position, and the third- and-19 TD pass from Jeff Sims to Malachi Carter put the Yellow Jackets on top.


  Louisville couldn’t sustain a drive on its next possession, and Georgia Tech did with the ball what Louisville failed to do – keep it on the ground, pound it forward, amass first downs and then hit a big pass to put the game away.


  Louisville couldn’t even get the ball across its own 25 on its next possession and turned the ball over on downs.


  Georgia Tech scored a touchdown on five of its six second-half drives.


  The end of the game for Louisville was listless and a bit bizarre. Georgia Tech was just looking to hand the ball off and run out the clock, but, after a Louisville timeout, Dontae Smith went off tackle to his right, and no one tackled him.


  Missed tackles were a problem in the game. Nor did the Cardinals benefit from losing standout cornerback Marlon Character on a targeting call.


  "To sum it up in two words, missed tackles," Satterfield said when asked about his team's defensive struggles. "(Jahmyr Gibbs) is a really good back, and he's run the ball hard against everybody he's played, but that's no excuse for us. We've got to do a better job tackling. We're not a very good tackling football team. And I think it's been that way for 3-4 years probably. We've got to do something about it. We've got to get better at it. And I think for us, we work on it. But we've got to continue to work on it. We've got to get stronger. We've got to get around the legs and get guys down. We've got to take better angles. It's all those things, continuing to work on tackling."


  Louisville got a decent enough game from Malik Cunningham, who completed 19 of 33 passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 50 yards (67 before sacks) and a pair of scores.


  But Hall's two fumbles and particularly the one by Hawkins – who nonetheless ran for 155 yards on 26 carries – told the tale of the Cardinals' night.


  And it wasn’t a happy one. This is a Louisville team that has not moved forward after being one of the most-improved teams in the nation a season ago. Losses to ranked opponents in Miami and Pittsburgh were disappointing. Losing to a Georgia Tech team when you’re favored is perplexing.


  Now, Satterfield said the challenge is handling adversity. He said he talked to his players about it after the game.


  "You've got to take it one day at a time," he said. "You can't look at expectations. If we looked at expectations last year, we would have tanked it early. You take it one week at a time and do the best you can. If things keep going tough like they are right now, then some people in this world jump ship. They quit and they give up. Just like life, is what I told them. It's like in a marriage, you and your partner are in a sticky situation, what are you going to do? Are you going to run from it, or are you going to fight for your marriage? It's the same situation. That's an analogy that we use. We've got to fight for our team and continue to bring it every single day. We play too many teams in this league, they're all good, they all can beat you. ... It all starts in practice. How committed are you? So we'll see when we get back to practice Sunday."


  For Louisville, questions still abound. Answers remain elusive.

East Chicago native Kenny Lofton enjoyed a 17-year career in Major League Baseball as a skilled center fielder and a premier lead off man and base stealer.


  Lofton graduated in 1985 from East Chicago Washington High. He attended the University of Arizona where he was torn between playing baseball or basketball, Lofton told Times sportswriter Glenn Minnis in 1993.


  “I didn’t really have a preference,” he said. “I loved them both and if it was left up to me, I’d be playing both professionally right now.”


  The Houston Astros drafted the 25-year-old speedster in the 17th round of the 1988 draft. He recorded the most triples (17) of any professional baseball player on any level while playing for Houston’s AAA team in Tucson, and then being brought up to the majors in 1991.


  The Astros traded him to the Cleveland Indians where Lofton hit .285 in his first full year, setting an American League rookie record by stealing 66 bases. He had 15 doubles, eight triples, five homers and 42 RBI, and was second in voting for AL Rookie of the Year.


  By 1993 he was chosen the AL’s “Most Exciting Player,” “Best Bunter” and “Fastest Baserunner” in a poll of major league managers.


  Lofton had three tours of duty with the Indians and played single seasons with the Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Philadelphia Phillies and Los Angels Dodgers; the White Sox, the San Francisco Giants, the Cubs, The Pittsburgh Pirates and Texas Rangers.


  Northwest Indiana baseball great Dan Plesac told The Times’ Al Hamnik, “Kenny had a real good idea of the strike zone. He wasn’t afraid to take pitches, he could bunt, he could hit in the alleys and he had a little bit of pop, too.”


  Lofton last worked in the majors in 2007. He now owns his own television production company, FilmPool Inc.

_Service animal goes on field during Maroon Typhoon performances_
  _•_
 In a year that is anything but normal, the Jones College Maroon Typhoon Marching Band has welcomed its first known service dog member this fall.
 Laurie, a 3-year-old golden retriever, is baritone saxophone player Sara-Beth McKellar’s service dog. The Vicksburg native was diagnosed with epilepsy as a sophomore in high school after her first seizure. McKellar was preparing to lift the barbell during a powerlifting competition when she passed out and began seizing. She began taking medication for epilepsy to try to control the seizures, but they were happening almost weekly.
 “It always seemed to happen at the most inconvenient time,” McKellar said. “I fell down the bleachers and herniated a disc, and I had a seizure in the bathroom and somehow locked the door. My mom (Kiely) is a nurse and she was very relieved when we got Laurie, especially when I decided to come to Jones for college.”
 Having her sister Anna Claire on campus her freshman year helped to ease her mom’s concerns. Last April, the family decided to launch a fundraising campaign to get a service dog, for additional reassurance. The day before McKellar’s birthday, the family drove to Madison, Va., to pick up Laurie from Service Dogs by Warren Retrievers. This life-saving addition to the family has changed Sara Beth by providing her more independence.
 “I’m a pretty shy person, and the last thing I wanted was to draw more attention, especially after having seizures,” McKellar said. “Having Laurie has certainly attracted more attention. However, she has also helped me to become more sociable and independent.”
 McKellar is also happy to report she has been seizure-free since adopting Laurie six months ago. There have been a couple of close calls, she admits, but Laurie was ready to help.
 “I have learned to take more breaks while working on the computer,” McKellar said. “Hopefully, I will grow out of the seizures like my dad, who inspires me, too.”
 Sara Beth’s father is Dr. Jason McKellar, principal of the Academy of Innovation in Vicksburg.
 Also inspired by Sara Beth and Laurie is Director of Bands at Jones College Dr. Ben Burge. This is the first time in his 21 years of teaching that he recalls having a service dog in the marching band. Laurie is also reportedly the first canine in the Maroon Typhoon Marching Band’s history.
 “I’m grateful Sara Beth has Laurie to provide that very special service. The puppy has added a lot of smiles to the band! She is adorable. However, we know we must let her work and not disturb her, but after practice, Laurie gets some love from band members,” Burge said. “We gladly welcome our first ‘marching’ service dog and Sara Beth. We are glad they are both members of the Maroon Typhoon.”
 Sara Beth said her freshman year in the Maroon Typhoon was a lot different than this year with COVID-19 and social-distancing protocols. Yet, her sophomore year has been special because of Laurie.
 “Thankfully, Laurie enjoys band, too. She does not like Walmart,” McKellar said. “I also hope as people who are intrigued by Laurie and want to get to know her, they will also want to get to know her handler and learn how Laurie provides medical help, protection and loves her ‘person’ while continually working.”

When it comes to why we root for the teams we root for, I think it comes down to a few factors: location, family, players, history and uniforms.


  The reason for my lifelong love for San Francisco teams started with my grandfather, Charlie Dossi. Charlie was the child of Italian immigrants and grew up in Sonora. After graduating from high school, he, like most in that era, fought in the war. After the war ended, he met my grandmother and they set up shop in San Francisco.


  Even though the 49ers were founded in 1946 and joined the NFL in 1949, the main attraction was college sports. Stanford, Cal and UCSF were the main attractions. In 1951, my father was born. His early memories of watching football with his dad were going to Stanford games. And because of that, Stanford is the college football team he roots for to this day.


  As time went on, the 49ers became a bigger deal and both my father and grandfather became fans. Then in 1958, San Francisco was given the Giants. Previously, the Giants were in New York and you can bet that grandpa didn’t follow an east coast team. But when the Giants headed west, he embraced the new club with open arms. And because of that, my dad became a Giants fan as well.


  Fast forward to 1988. I entered the world in August and, within weeks of being born, my father had me wearing little baby Giants and 49er outfits. So yeah, I guess I was born into being a fan. And rooting for the Giants and 49ers is a bond my father and I still have.

In a game that didn’t feature a lot to feel good about, the return of all-pro tight end George Kittle was the exception. In his first game back on the field since the opening contest of the season, Kittle picked up right where he left off. Kittle had a game-high 183 yards receiving on 15 receptions with one touchdown.


  The loss of defensive end Nick Bosa has really been on full display the past few games. San Francisco was unable to put a major pass rush on Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz, which allowed him to have all the time he needed to complete passes.


  And just like every week, the injuries continue to pile up. Newly signed defensive end Ziggy Anash is out for the year with a torn bicep and cornerback K’Waun Williams is likely headed to the injured reserve with a knee sprain.


  The loss pushes the 49ers to 2-2 on the season. The good news is there could be some fresh bodies returning to the field. Linebacker Dre Greenlaw, running back Raheem Mostert and possibly Garoppolo could be back sooner, rather than later. And this week the practice window is opened for cornerback Richard Sherman to return to action, after being placed on short-term injured reserve with a calf injury.


  The 49ers look to return to the win column as they take on the Miami Dolphins (1-3). The last time they took the field, the Dolphins lost to the undefeated Seattle Seahawks 31-23. On paper, the Dolphins should be a team who San Francisco should be able to beat, but the same was said last week against Philadelphia.


  If the 49ers can somehow figure out a way to put pressure on Miami quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick and get back to running the ball with authority, a win should be in the cards. If the 49ers do win, perhaps it’ll be another close game. The prediction is San Francisco 23, Miami 17.

Born in Merrillville, Eugene Wilson went on to star for the hometown Pirates, eventually leading to a collegiate and professional football career where he won two Super Bowl rings with the New England Patriots.


  At Merrillville, Wilson was a letterman in football and basketball. He was a two-time All-State selection and, as a senior, was named the Duneland Athletic Conference's defensive player of the year. In basketball, he was a four-year varsity letterman and starter, and was a two-time All-DAC selection.


  He attended the University of Illinois, where he majored in speech communications. The safety finished his career with 176 tackles (139 solo, 37 assists), 11 interceptions and 60 pass deflections. He also had 93 punt returns for 896 yards and two touchdowns.


  Wilson was selected in the second round (36th overall) of the 2003 NFL Draft. He helped the Patriots win Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2003 and Super Bowl XXXIX in 2004. In '04, he recovered a fumble by Philadelphia Eagles tight end L.J. Smith before leaving the game after sustaining an injury on a kickoff. He also intercepted Ben Roethlisberger in a 41-27 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004 AFC Championship.


  In 2007 against the New York Jets, Wilson returned a Kellen Clemens interception for a touchdown, making him the 21st Patriot to score a touchdown that season, tying an NFL record. Wilson bounced around in 2008, signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 14 before being released Sept. 1 that same year. Two days after his release, he was signed by the Houston Texans, where he had an interception in a win over the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 20.


  On February 18, 2011, the Texans released Wilson. He played 96 games in his eight-year career finishing with 399 tackles, four fumble recoveries, 41 pass deflections and 14 interceptions.

After a month on the run, Sip got swallowed up by law enforcement on Thursday afternoon.
 Stephen “Sip” Ruffin, 19, was taken into custody by the Jones County Sheriff’s Department, with assistance from U.S. Marshals, at a residence on 29th Street in Laurel, lead Investigator Reuben Bishop of the JCSD said.
 Ruffin is charged with kidnapping and armed robbery after the Sept. 8 hold-up at a residence on Moselle-Oak Grove Road in the pre-dawn hours. Ruffin and accomplice Trevon Lampley, 21, of Laurel are accused of taking a young teenager hostage after holding his grandfather at gunpoint and stealing items from the home. Lampley is being held on $40,000 bond and Ruffin was set to make his initial appearance in Jones County Justice Court on Friday afternoon.
 The case was a high priority and Bishop is glad to have Ruffin in custody. So are the family members who were terrorized that morning, he said.
 “We’ve been constantly going by and checking on addresses of his family members and associates,” Bishop said. “We followed up on every tip … we finally got some good info.”
 Tips led law enforcement to the 29th Street residence where Ruffin was taken into custody without incident early Thursday afternoon. “He came out the front door,” Bishop said.
 Bishop had been keeping the victims posted throughout the investigation and they were “very happy” to find out that the second suspect was in handcuffs. The crime was apparently random, Bishop said.
 The suspects are accused of going into the residence around 4:30 that morning and stealing a wallet, phone, Xbox and other items while wearing hoodies and masks and armed with guns.
 “The grandfather woke up with a gun in his face,” Bishop said.
 Two adults and two teenagers were in the home at the time. The robbers “told them to be still,” and after they stole the items, they forced one of the teens to go with them, Bishop said. The teen was forced into the robbers’ car at gunpoint, then released “about a mile down the road.” The victims were not injured, Bishop said.
 Law enforcement officials were able to identify the suspects using bank surveillance footage from when they tried to use the victim’s debit card, Bishop said.
 "We greatly appreciate the assistance of the U.S. Marshals in tracking down 'Sip' and helping us bring his running to an end,” Sheriff Joe Berlin said. “We have said it before — ‘Run all you want, you will just go to jail tired.’”

Former White Sox slugger Ron Kittle was never afraid of hard work.


  Kittle was born in Gary on Jan. 5, 1958. He was one of six children born to Jim, an ironworker in the steel mills, and Dorothy Kittle.


  Kittle took to baseball at a young age, and his father began coaching him at age 6 in the Aetna Little League.


  Kittle told The Times when his father died in 1994 that his dad was his "biggest fan and hardest critic."


  The future power-hitter spent his freshman year at Andrean High School before transferring to Wirt High School where he played baseball for legendary coach Jerry Troxel.


  Kittle was drafted by the Dodgers in 1976 after a tryout camp in LaPorte. In his first official game in the Midwest League, Kittle broke his neck when a catcher stepped on it while he was sliding into home.


  He thought his baseball days were over and went to work in the steel mills as an ironworkers' apprentice. He said the hard manual labor helped him regain his strength.


  He tried out for the Sox in 1978 after being scouted by the late Billy Pierce and they signed him to a contract. He made his Major League debut in 1982 and earned the American League Rookie of the Year Award in 1983 with 35 home runs and 100 RBIs.


  He stayed with the Sox through 1986 and hit seven career rooftop shots at old Comiskey Park, a Major League record.


  Kittle wore jersey No. 42 for most of his career, the number worn by Jackie Robinson. Major League Baseball retired the number for all teams in 1997 in Robinson's memory.


  The designated hitter, left fielder and occasional first baseman played for the Yankees, Indians and Orioles but returned to the Sox in 1989 and 1990 and briefly again in 1991, the year he played his last game.


  In 1989, Kittle founded Indiana Sports Charities to support cancer research and education. The organization hosted annual celebrity golf tournaments in the Region and later, motorcycle runs.


  After he retired from baseball, Kittle went on to manage the Schaumburg Fliers nonaffiliated minor league team from 1998 to 2001.


  In 2005, he wrote "Ron Kittle's Tales from the Chicago White Sox Dugout," sharing his life's story and anecdotes from his years in baseball.


  Kittle is co-owner of the Northwest Indiana Oilmen, a Midwest Collegiate League team in Whiting.


  He also makes hand-crafted benches and chairs from bats, bases and baseballs, often for current and retired players and for charities. He currently serves as a White Sox ambassador.


  The father of two made his home for years in Chesterton before moving to the far southern suburb of Mokena.

This evening, the two most productive passers in the SEC — Matt Corral and Mac Jones — will go head-to-head in an SEC West showdown between the Ole Miss Rebels and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Kickoff is set for 6:30 tonight (Saturday) on ESPN.
 Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin, who served as an offensive coordinator for Alabama head coach Nick Saban, joked that his former boss was too old and bent out of shape to cover him on a football field. When the two teams meet at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, however, Kiffin will face a much taller task, as he attempts to slow down a Crimson Tide offense that has averaged 62 points per game against the Rebels over the past three seasons.
 Ole Miss lost its opener to No. 5 Florida in an explosive offensive battle, but bounced back in a wild 42-41 overtime win over Kentucky last weekend. The Rebels now hope that they can knock off No. 2 Alabama at home, which would make Kiffin the first former Saban assistant to topple his former employer’s team.
 "I think that's a storyline," Kiffin said, "but I don't think it's really that big a deal. We worked together for three years, (I) learned a lot from him, had a great run, very productive teams with a lot of great players and a lot of great wins.
 "We have the No. 1 team in the country coming in. In my opinion, the premier program in the country. No offense to Clemson, you know, those are the two premier programs that are operating at the highest level over the last, whatever, 10 years. And this one's doing it in the SEC, so it's a little bit harder."
 Ole Miss trailed 28-14 early in the third quarter against Kentucky before rallying with three unanswered touchdowns. An extra point made by Hattiesburg native Luke Logan in overtime provided the margin of victory. The Rebels sit just below the Tide at fourth in the FBS in passing offense, averaging 381.5 yards per game through the air. Ole Miss also ranks 42nd nationally in rushing, with an average of 154.5 yards per game on the ground, led by former Hattiesburg star Snoop Conner and former Jackson Prep star Jerrion Ealy.
 Corral, who outlasted Oak Grove alum John Rhys Plumlee to win Kiffin’s first quarterback battle in Oxford, has connected on 46 of 60 pass attempts for 715 yards with seven touchdowns and one interception.
 Former Laurel standout Dontario Drummond has contributed scoring plays all three times he has touched the ball in the first two games, reeling in two catches for 62 yards and two touchdowns against Florida and connecting with Plumlee on a 45-yard touchdown toss to show off passing skills he gained while playing quarterback during his youth football days.
 Elijah Moore boasts a team-leading 20 receptions for 319 yards and a score on the season, while Kenny Yeboah (8 catches, 174 yards and 2 TDs) and Jonathan Mingo (8 catches, 128 yards and 2 TDs) have served as solid secondary options in what has proven to be a deep, talented group of receivers.
 Though the offensive numbers are exceptional, Ole Miss has struggled defensively in its first two games. The Rebels were shredded in the opener by Florida and then were gashed for 557 yards and 41 points against Kentucky. That kind of showing could be detrimental against an Alabama offense that has not skipped a beat despite having to replace four first-round draft picks from last fall.
 Alabama ranks fifth among FBS teams in passing offense this season, racking up 369 yards per game through the air, and the Tide ranks third in scoring with an average of 45 points per game. Jones, who won the starting quarterback position over true freshman Bryce Young, has completed 38 of 51 passes for 684 yards and six touchdowns. DeVonta Smith leads the receiving corps in receptions with 14 for 152 yards and a score. Jaylen Waddle and John Metchie III have been the biggest down field threats, however, both averaging more than 21 yards per catch in their first two games as starters on Saban’s offense.
 If the two coaches' familiarity with one another plays a factor, such would not seem to favor Kiffin. Saban is 20-0 in games against head coaches who have worked for him.
 Saban ran his record to 4-0 against former assistant Jimbo Fisher in a 52-24 victory against Texas A&M last Saturday.
 When Kiffin was Tennessee's head coach in 2009, he fell just short of taking down the Tide in a 12-10 loss.
 "Everybody says (the former assistants) know him," Kiffin said. "Well, he knows the assistants. I think it goes both ways."

HOUSTON — All Houston resident Alice Torres has wanted in the three years since Hurricane Harvey hit was to repair her family’s flood-damaged home so her 85-year-old mother can feel safe and settled again.


  But when her mother, Dolores Torres, died from COVID-19 on Aug. 2, her family was still trying to get help from a Houston program that has been criticized for its slow pace in repairing homes damaged by the massive storm. The state took over the program this week and Torres and other residents who have applied for assistance say they’re worried that could lead to yet more delays.


  “She deserved so much better. She deserved her house. She deserved to have seen it nice,” Torres, 54, said Thursday. She said her home still has Harvey- related electrical and plumbing issues due to insufficient help from insurance and shoddy work from a contractor.


  Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner called the state takeover a “power grab,” while the Texas General Land Office, which now runs the program, said its actions are justified because the city’s lack of progress in repairing homes was unacceptable. Housing advocates say they worry that the discord between the city and state will result in vulnerable people who still need help — including the elderly and disabled — being left behind.


  The GLO announced this week that it has received federal approval to take control of the $1.3 billion the city was awarded to repair and rebuild homes, provide rental assistance and create new affordable housing. A third of the funding — nearly $428 million — went to a program for home repair and reconstruction.


  Harvey dumped up to 50 inches of rain on the Houston area following landfall on Aug. 25, 2017. It killed 68 people and caused about $125 billion in damage in Texas. In the Houston area, Harvey flooded more than 150,000 homes, with more than 16,000 residents identified as potentially needing repair help.


  GLO spokeswoman Brittany Eck said the city has only fixed or rebuilt 88 homes and has reimbursed 93 people who did their own repairs. In its own program, the land office has fixed more than 2,000 homes and has approved nearly 2,900 reimbursements statewide.


  “To those homeowners that are still waiting three years after the storm, (the takeover is) really the only option to get them any assistance,” Eck said.


  The GLO has offered to let the city keep control of some funding, including for multifamily rental and homebuyer assistance programs.


  Turner said he was frustrated by the takeover but remained committed to finding a solution. The city blamed the GLO's muddled guidance over homeowner assistance applications for the slow pace of repairs.


  “We will continue to do everything on our end to make sure that homeowners are not overlooked and shortchanged,” Turner said.


  A lawsuit the city filed to stop the takeover remains pending. The Texas Supreme Court in August stayed a lower court ruling that had blocked the GLO from taking over the city’s Harvey recovery funds.


  Julia Orduña, with Texas Housers, a nonprofit that works on housing issues, said her organization is worried the GLO focuses too much on statistics and that because it operates on a first-come-first-serve basis, the most vulnerable will be left behind.


  “We are more concerned that equitable work gets done and the funding should be utilized quickly and for the people that need it ... The government should be able to get on the ball and do that for its constituents,” Orduña said.


  Tension over the city’s repair program was apparent during a City Council meeting Tuesday in which Turner and some council members pushed back on criticism from a group of residents known as the Harvey Forgotten Survivors Caucus, describing their comments as scripted. One caucus member, Doris Brown, told council members “we need action for the people, not infighting and red tape.”


  Torres, who is also part of the caucus, said she was upset by the reaction officials had to their concerns. Mary Benton, a spokeswoman for Turner, said some of the comments during Tuesday's meeting were not productive but that the mayor “listens to all Houstonians and he is willing to work with them, especially as it relates to the repair program."


  Torres, whose health problems worsened when she also contracted COVID-19, said she remained hopeful the city or state will help her and others whose homes still need repairs.


  “I have to hope that somebody is going to do right by us,” she said.

Today (Saturday) marks the final day of National Newspaper Week, an annual celebration of the importance of newspapers to American society. If ever a time in America needed newspapers, it is now.
 The national media, whether in the form of 24-hour cable news or through social media platforms, has proved itself to be agenda-driven and reliant almost completely on clicks. Most outlets play to their ideological base, which tamp down opposing views. Watch CNN or MSNBC and there is no news — it is agenda-driven drivel. Fox News, although better than the other two, has a substantial lean to the conservative side. The three national news networks — CBS, ABC and NBC — have foregone most of their historical objectivity. It is blatantly obvious. Large newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post, once held up as beacons for straight-news gathering, have fallen into an agenda-driven strategy as well. In too many of these outlets, the line between news and opinion not only has been blurred, it’s been destroyed.
 And then there are local newspapers whose goal is to inform the public without fear or favor on its news pages, while delivering opinions where they belong. The job of a local newspaper is to keep an eye on public officials, call out corruption and stand up for those who cannot stand for themselves.
 That has been proved true in these pages again over the past several weeks after reporter Jack Hammett discovered a bevy of eviction cases getting thrown out of Jones County Justice Court by Judge Noel Rogers. Digging deeper, Hammett found that payments hadn’t been being recorded and conditions at the Section 8 housing development have been as bad as the bookkeeping. Most of those residents don’t have the means to hire an attorney, so their voices have gone unheard. But because of coverage in this newspaper and a reporter’s efforts, officials have said they will investigate further. As Supervisor Travares Comegys said, “I saw it in the newspaper.”
 Taking stances against the comfortable members of our society is not always the popular thing to do. It has cost this newspaper many thousands of dollars over the years. But we are confident that what we do not only is important to our community, but 100 percent necessary. It is with that commitment that we will continue to watch and act, whether it is popular or not.
 We are happy to have been able to celebrate another National Newspaper Week. We hope we are around to celebrate 100 more of them. That will be up to you, our readers, to make that happen. True, unapologetic news sources are few and far between in today’s society. Don’t let it go the way of the Dodo bird. Support it. The truth is harder to find than ever now.

Republican incumbent Jim Biggs is facing Democrat Becky Mateja Lombardini in the race for 1st District Porter County commissioner.


  The district covers the northern third of the county and all Porter County voters have this race on the ballot regardless of where they live.


  Biggs is a veteran of Porter County government. He has served two nonconsecutive terms on the Board of Commissioners, 1992 through 1999 and 2016 to now. He also was elected twice to the Porter County Council.


  Mateja Lombardini is a newcomer to county government, although she has lived in the county 20 years. Mateja Lombardini was slated after the primary, when she realized no Democrat was on the ballot for that race.

Law360 (October 9, 2020, 7:27 PM EDT) -- A Georgia federal judge has given preliminary approval to a derivative settlement that would require new controls at MiMedx Group Inc. and pay $3.5 million to plaintiffs' counsel to resolve shareholders' allegations that the biotech company's executives engaged in a yearslong scheme to inflate revenue.      U.S. District Judge William M. Ray II gave the initial green light Thursday to settle a federal suit and two related shareholder derivative actions pending in Florida and Georgia state courts that alleged the executives amplified revenue in a so-called channel-stuffing scheme.

It is every kid's dream - Halloween on a Saturday night. But this year, COVID-19 may have put a curse on the trick-or-treaters of Greater Sudbury.


  Mayor Brian Bigger said Friday the city is still deciding whether or not to permit the annual activity, in light of the rising number of cases of COVID-19 locally and across the province.


  "As for Halloween, I continue to speak with Chief (Paul) Pederson and Dr. (Penny) Sutcliffe about the safest scenarios for our children and our community for Oct. 31," Bigger said in a statement to the press. "Other communities have already cancelled trick-or-treating and we're waiting for direction and guidance from the province. It might be best to now start considering some creative options for your kids that can still make the day fun."


  Public Health Sudbury and Districts reported earlier this week the 110th case of COVID-19 within its catchment area. Currently there are two unresolved cases and 106 successful resolutions. Regionally there have been two deaths attributed to the coronavirus.


  Bigger also offered advice for the upcoming long weekend.


  "As we approach Thanksgiving weekend, there is a lot to be grateful for," he said. "As mayor, I'm thankful for the fortunate situation we find ourselves in as the country deals with this second wave of COVID-19. Greater Sudbury still remains in the lowest category of communities with cases and transmission. We're doing things right."


  This, he said, "is in no small part due to the fact all of us are listening to our public health experts, masking up when going out, and avoiding crowds and gatherings. We have all seen recently in Washington how one bad choice can spread this virus to so many people so quickly. It's an example of what happens when we let our guard down and think we are invincible to this virus."


  With Thanksgiving just around the corner, Bigger cautioned residents to "stay resilient, strong and smart." He referred to provincial guidelines to only celebrate the holiday with those in your immediate household.


  "Every level of government and every public health expert is asking all of us to keep this weekend's dinner to people within our household," he said. "I know this is a weekend when we usually all gather round; it's when our kids come home from school or when we travel to see loved ones -- but this is the weekend to put those plans on hold if possible. We have all seen how one event can spread this disease at a fever pitch and if we want to avoid more cases, if we want to see our restaurants, retailers and schools stay open, it will be up to us to keep our community healthy, COVID-free and running as it does now. I will be the first to acknowledge these are hard decisions to make, but restricting this weekend's celebrations is the choice we all must make in order to keep ourselves and one another safe."


  Bigger also encouraged residents to get outside to enjoy the fall foliage. The leaves are turning quickly now and fluttering to the ground. It is an excellent time to go for a hike, if just to hear the dried leaves crunch underfoot.


  "This is one of the most beautiful times of the year to see and explore Greater Sudbury," the mayor said. "The colours are magnificent, the air is fresh. I'll be out for walks with my wife or riding on my bike, taking in everything I can before the weather turns cold. My kids and grandkids will be staying south, but we'll be in touch and celebrating together from afar."

I was one million percent genuine in that, because -- like I said -- it took me awhile to really get into the game and play _Big Brother_ the way it should be played because I had so much on my mind about wanting to do the right thing, wanting the right people to be successful and when they ended up on the block together, I felt like it was my fault. I felt so guilty that I could’ve possibly prevented it and I didn’t. So, I was one million percent being genuine with that and Christmas kinda had to knock some game sense into me and be like, "Listen, I can’t backdoor you. You are my final two." Like, that would make no sense. And from there, I kinda had to turn on _Big Brother_ mode and keep playing, ‘cause that’s what I was there for. But I was one million percent genuine.

Fast food entrepreneur Junior Bridgeman couldn't believe what he heard while working next to an employee one day, a young man who seemed quiet and distant.


  "How's it going?" asked Bridgeman, trying to break the ice.


  The kid shrugged as if to say "What is it to you?"


  Bridgeman wondered how life had been treating his employee and was told, bluntly: "Today is no different than tomorrow's going to be or the day after that."


  Most employers might shake their head regretfully and walk away. But the 1971 E.C. Washington grad and former NBA star is not your ordinary boss.


  Bridgeman helped lead unbeaten Washington to the 1971 state basketball championship, then starred at Louisville before enjoying a productive 12-year NBA career, much of it with the Milwaukee Bucks.


  As CEO of Bridgeman Hospitality Group, he owns 244 Wendy's franchises and 120 Chili's franchises — more than 400 stores counting the Perkins Restaurants and Fazoli's he also runs.


  That's 18,000 employees and all are an integral part of Bridgeman's food empire. So much, in fact, his businesses offer health care and educational assistance to help workers improve their lifestyles.


  Years ago, he established a charter school in Milwaukee and then a boys school in Louisville, where he claims there are 1,000 homeless children.


  Some, like that quiet kid, can be impossible to reach.


  "He told me what he was doing ... he was in the illegal drug business," Bridgeman recalled. "He's just a teenager, so your heart breaks because you know where that life can lead. He was not ashamed to tell me 'This is the only reason I'm here.'"


  The boy wanted to have a W-2 form to hide his income.


  "As I stood there and listened to him, I wondered just how did it get to this point? How did it become so acceptable that he had no qualms about telling me and that it had become sort of a badge of honor for him out in the community," Bridgeman said.


  "He told me the only way that changes is if maybe he moves up in whatever hierarchy they had, but he did not see himself in a situation that would be improving at all."


  Bridgeman spoke in November 2014 at a Gary Chamber of Commerce luncheon. He spoke about having dreams, a backup plan, specific goals, and the importance of a solid education.


  Most kids will never become professional athletes, the odds are heavily against them, but education or technical training can open countless doors to a fulfilling life.


  "Not everybody has the ability to get a four-year degree or an advanced degree but you can become a plumber or electrician and be successful," Bridgeman said. "It's the training that matters."


  Today, his net worth is estimated at almost $600 million.

If all three verdicts are appealed, the survivor has the choice to either dismiss the case or move forward with a formal resolution which includes a pre-hearing conference and panel hearing. The hearing consists of three to five University employees and students, wherein parties can present evidence and provide witnesses for cross-examination.
 According to LSU's Title XI statement, “Students found responsible for violating this policy may expect the range of sanctions to include, but not be limited to, disciplinary probation, deferred suspension, suspension, expulsion psychological assessment, counseling, social restrictions, limited presence on campus, revocation of admission or degree.”
 All of that sounds great on paper, but it's proven to be essentially useless in practice. Sexual assault survivors on our campus often go through this painful, extensive process and get no justice. Too many have just fallen through the cracks.
 I spoke with one student who said many who go through this hopeless process express feel mistreated by the administration and believe the University’s consistent suggestions to 'seek therapy' is simply a way to get claimants to dismiss their cases so they can be swept under the rug.
 Victims dread speaking with administration, as the University handles cases like they could care less if justice is served.
 One of the employees who regularly came up in my investigation was Associate Dean of Students & Director Jonathan Sanders. The student I spoke with said she and other victims she knew felt Sanders has interrogated them in a condescending manner.

Kupcho -- winner of the inaugural Augusta National Women's Amateur -- has yet to transfer the success of her celebrated collegiate career over to the LPGA Tour. She was the No. 1 ranked amateur at Wake Forest and won the 2018 NCAA Division I Golf Championship. At majors, she failed to make the cut four times, including at the last two Women's British Opens.
 At Aronimink, Kupcho went back to what worked for her in college. She decided to use the Ping i210 irons she played with as an amateur after a talk with her parents.
 Kupcho, who also brought on a new caddie in Kyle Alexander, played each nine at Aronimink only once leading into the tournament and found the unfamiliarity with the sloped greens may have worked to her advantage.
 "Going into last week, I was not prepared, like I felt completely unprepared," she said. "I felt the same way coming into this week. I didn't feel like I was ready to come play this type of a golf course. I think not being prepared brings another challenge for me, and I think that's what helps me play well."
 Kang, the 2017 KPMG Women's PGA Championship winner, also is in the hunt for her second career major. If she gets it, it will come on one of the tougher courses this season on the tour.
 Kang visualized she was in a putting contest with her brother in a bid to loosen up and steady her short game, and promptly sank a 15-footer to close out the 12th hole.
 "There is no right shot, but there are wrong misses," she said. "That creates that opportunity of really tough up-and-downs. A couple times I hit a really good shot and I got penalized for hitting a good shot, but I just didn't think far enough to not hit it there."
 Ciganda, a 30-year-old Spaniard, suffered through a lengthy bout of COVID-19 earlier this year that left her quarantined in her Arizona apartment for at least a month. She said at least three tests over that span came back positive and she needed at least another month and a half after her first negative to truly start to feel completely healthy. A two-time winner on the LPGA Tour, Ciganda suffered from memory issues, fatigue and weight loss during her ordeal.
 "I'm happy that I'm playing again and feeling pretty good again," she said.
 Nelly Korda, the No. 2-ranked player in the world, dropped out with a back injury after she shot a 71 in the opening round. ANA Inspiration winner Mirim Lee also withdrew because of an injury.
 Su Oh, at 5 over at the time, had perhaps the shot of the day on 16 when she lofted one out of the green-side bunker and sank the first eagle of the tournament.
 There are only 13 players under par through the second round.

Victims have gone through this process with clear evidence to support their claims and still received no justice. One woman I spoke to had a written confession from her attacker, yet the only punishment he served was a deferred suspension.
 Under a deferred suspension, the attacker can still roam freely around campus, with the only stipulation being that he'll be suspended if he violates University policy again.
 How is that supposed to make victims feel? It's as if their cases don't really matter to the University.
 The student I spoke to described the joy and hope she felt when she found out her attacker had received guilty verdicts, only to be let down when she realized he would still walk free. Throughout this process, she went through panic attacks and nightmares reliving her attack, hoping to keep other people safe from her assaulter.
 And victims are not even protected from their attackers on campus. The student in question requested her attacker be removed from any classes she was also enrolled in and her request was denied. The administration offered to remove her from the courses instead.
 Sexual assault survivors on our campus cannot even go to class without potentially running into the person that assaulted them. The University doesn't even keep a public record of the students that have committed these crimes in order to keep other potential victims safe.
 Our administration has proven that it cannot effectively deal with sexual assault cases on campus. The University should not be given the authority to preside over these cases on its own. It cannot protect its students.
 We commit so much to this school when those in charge can't even commit to trying to keep us safe. Enough is enough.

Callaway said that she respected Bluestar for taking action to address the litter problem.


  “You can talk about what a mess it is, or you can just come out and clean it,” she said. “It’s incredibly well organized. I’m so impressed.”


  Down by the old limestone quarry, Robert Peffer was wrangling a mass of rusty barbed wire into manageable shape to be placed in the bed of a pickup truck. He brought along a truck and dump trailer from his tree removal company, Peffer’s Tree Service, which is based in Dorrington. His family and his work crew also volunteered for the day.


  “I went to school with Kopavi, and I saw her reaching out for help out here,” he said. “I figured myself and my guys could come out and lend a hand cleaning up our hometown.”


  At 12:30 p.m., the group gathered for lunch. The meal was provided at no cost courtesy of Murphys Pizza Co., Firewood and Murphys Pourhouse. Sierra Hills Market pitched in to provide free bottles of ice-cold water.


  Other businesses and individuals that contributed to the event include Sierra Stain & Seal, Country Yard Care, Calaveras Clean Up, Freedom Energy Inc., Thompson Construction, JR Woodworks, Murphys Historic Hotel, Nash Chevron, and Lisa and Tim Mutterties. Rangers from New Melones provided trash pickup tools, masks and sanitizer.


  Along with Bluestar, the other administrators of the Facebook page are Jeff Brown, Shaira Hegel, Krystina Jarnagin, Ian Aiton and David Wiegel, while Cynthia Sudduth is the page’s moderator.


  Bluestar and Jarnagin, of Arnold, have been the main drivers behind the group. This summer, Jarnagin joined the White Pines Park Committee and began leading a weekly clean-up event at the park at 3 p.m. on Tuesdays.


  “There’s no one paid to take care of that park, so it’s all up to volunteers,” she said.


  Jarnagin’s grandfather, Jim Carlon, owner of Arnold Auto Supply, helped form the White Pines Park Committee many years ago, and recently paid out-of-pocket for several signs and banners discouraging littering which have been placed by the group.


  “They’re only in Arnold right now, but we’re hoping to get more,” Jarnagin said.


  Jarnagin said that she was excited that the group was bringing people together during a divisive time.


  “It doesn’t matter what your political beliefs are or if we disagree or agree on different situations,” she said. “This is something we can all come together and agree on – that we need to pick up and do something about the litter problem. That’s what I think is really cool about it. … It’s contagious too, just helping out. I’m excited to see where this goes.”


  While the volunteers were working hard, they seemed to be enjoying themselves.


  “It’s almost like a party,” Jarnagin said. “Especially now, where we can sit down and eat and enjoy each other’s company, feeling good about ourselves for doing all of this work.”


  Jarnagin said that the formation of the group has been a bright spot in a challenging year.


  “It’s keeping us happy and busy and doing good things,” she said. “We need that right now, especially this year.”


  Bluestar said on Monday that she was happy with how the event turned out.


  “We managed to fill up four trailers, and so many trucks left with loads that I couldn’t even count them all,” she said. “We didn’t get everything, but at the same time, I feel like we got more than we thought we were going to get. I feel like people showed up just willing to work.”


  The best part of the event was all of the positive feedback from volunteers, Bluestar said.


  “Even though it was a dirty job, and when we showed up it seemed impossible, at the end I feel like everyone was so proud and spirits were really high,” she said. “Everyone was really happy with how it went.”


  The group plans on finishing up the job this coming Sunday.

FOMO is the acronym for the “fear of missing out.” The term was coined in the mid-2000s as shorthand for a growing form of social anxiety about not being in on the latest happenings and events, particularly as online displays of all the fun other people were having increased through channels such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram being delivered directly to developing smartphone technology.


  While I’ve never particularly cared much about those avenues or many of the things that happen on them – I’m just thankful that my columns and stories about the outdoors are automatically posted to them for my tens and tens of readers - I do experience this phenomenon, sometimes on a daily basis and particularly in fall.


  It’s not because I don’t have tickets to Coachella, or the Red Bull sky surfing series or some other social media status-worthy event, but rather because I, like many hunters this time of year, find myself thinking about all the options available in the field.


  Take last Friday for example. All around me, singles and doubles of sharptailed grouse were flushed by my hard-working dog along the edge of the cut wheat field. One would get up, I’d take a shot or two and then ten feet closer another pair would flush.


  Ole would work the grassy border of the field and go on point at some unseen target, and with the command would dive in to send another up. I shot so poorly on the amazingly close birds, I could have coined a new term by the end of the walk, and just gone with FOM for “fear of missing.”


  Perhaps it was because my mind was elsewhere, like on my deer stand 15 miles away. Especially as the wind began to drop and a stillness settled in over the rolling hillsides as evening approached, I found my mind wandering there, thinking of the five-by-five whitetail that certainly was standing broadside in front of my perch at 11 yards, setting up an ideal chip shot that even a half experienced archer like myself could have made.


  Even though the recent set of trail camera pictures showed most antlered activity in the area happening around two in the morning, I couldn’t shake the idea that I was missing out on tagging up. As I finally bagged a bird and made the turn back toward the truck, I began to think that the sweat developing in the slight heat of the hike was less about physical exertion and more from the stress of imagining what was going on in another realm of hunting.


  As an outdoorsman - and one who is high strung to begin with (the fact I bowhunt at all I consider a small miracle due to the patience and stillness required) - I possess that heightened gene which makes it not just a requirement, but almost second nature, to always be thinking ahead. Living in the moment can be difficult when one is already planning for pheasant opener, the start of deer season, or thinking about first ice, when it’s only late September.


  Even when standing in the middle of the field watching a dog curl and charge on fresh scent, I’ll find myself considering the options I may have months down the road, and while the element of time and planning for it is the challenge that all people face, the fear of missing out is doubled when you add in the concept of space.


  Should I hunt this Walk-In Area or that Wildlife Management Area? Stand A or Stand B? Head north to the draw or south to the river bottom? Geez, I haven’t even snuck in a fall trout trip this year – would that be a better option?


  The many places and pursuits available this time of year make a form of FOMO real, but instead of comparing social media feeds, it’s more about wondering what the next best alternative would be, and I’m not going to get into the opportunity cost lessons from a macroeconomics class I’ve long since forgotten and save that for another column.


  Oh, and the trail camera photos from the time during the Friday afternoon grouse hunt? Just grass blowing in the wind which confirmed I did make the right choice, but they led me into a little bit of an existential deep dive.


  The realization of who I am, where I am, and what I love doing will always drive me a little bit crazy while trying to live in the moment. As I try to prioritize my activities, the growing enjoyment of each new one I’ve added to my autumn collides with the satisfaction of those I have pursued the longest and loved the most, which also occur in fall.


  That’s why I, and likely you, keep coming back to as many outdoor opportunities as possible as the season shifts with the limited hours we all seem to have these days and doing any one of them means we’re not missing out on anything (unless we’re not shooting well).


  In the end, the first step out of the truck is the first step toward living in the moment and overcoming FOMO, because the only real anxiety this time of year for any hunter should be the concern of ending up on a couch during daylight hours when all these opportunities abound … in our outdoors.

ADRIAN -- In the past 16 seasons, the Siena Heights men's soccer team has only had four final records that were at or over .500, and has not had one since 2010 when the Saints went 10-8-1 under Aldo Zid.


   


  SHU's men's squad has had three coaches in that span, Zid, former Tecumseh girls soccer coach Thomas Goodman and Drew Crawford, who is in his third season at the helm of the team. This year's iteration of the Saints might not be the one to snap that ignominious streak of seasons under .500, but this is a team that is balancing working on building toward the future with competing now.


   


  "Our expectation now is to always make the playoffs in the conference and we'd love to finish in the top half of the conference, so sixth or better," Crawford said. "Our conference is extremely competitive so we know that's a tough task for teams like us that are not the top four teams that have kind of separated themselves from everybody else, but we're trying to close those gaps and a top six would be a great year for us."


   


  Just looking at the Saints list of opponents this year is a bit unique due to the coronavirus pandemic.


   


  Their schedule isn't a fully fall schedule, as SHU's conference, the Wolverine-Hoosier Athletic Conference, did what most other NAIA conferences did when COVID-19 hit and pushed all championships to the spring. That move effectively forced most teams to change their schedules to be a split between a very trimmed down fall season and the majority of the games in the spring of 2021.


   


  For their part, the Saints entered the season with four official fall games scheduled and have already played one of those four, a 3-0 loss to Indiana Tech on Oct. 3 after having lost 4-0 in an exhibition against crosstown rivals Adrian College at the end of September. Once SHU wraps its fall slate with its lone game away from O'Laughlin Stadium at Cornerstone on Oct. 24, the Saints will not see the field in competition again until February.


   


  While Crawford is exploring options, including the possibility of renting some dome space, the four-plus month hiatus between games is an added challenge.


   


  "When you're playing once or twice a week you get into a rhythm and a routine and I think the guys like that," Crawford said. "To play three or four games and then have a five or six-month break, especially in the winter here where we can't get outside and continue to practice, I think that will be a detriment to us in the long run."


   


  One of the keys to the Saints being able to overcome the added test this season is its core of seniors, which out of a roster of 45 student-athletes, brings to bear 10 seniors, least of all their three captains, midfielder Remy Collard, forward Gustavo Barros and goalkeeper Andrew Kozan whose experience guiding traffic at the back is going to be big this season with Siena having a large number of young defenders.


   


  "(Kozan) almost like having a coach on the field," Crawford said, "especially being in the back line being able to see and help organize the defenders and let the players know what he's seeing from his sightline. He's played the game long enough and understands it well enough that he can make those adjustments in-game and make us much better in the back."


   


  As it builds toward the future, the SHU squad needs its seniors to lead but there will be some less inexperienced players that are going to be looked at to take on a bigger role this year, including senior Webster Ruiter (defender), freshmen Cezar Oliveira (defender) along with sophomore Robert D'Angelo (defender).


   


  "(Oliveria) brings an intimidation factor," Crawford said. "He's six-four, six-five, he's a big body that has a lot of talent as well, he's very good in the air. But just the size factor as a defender, a lot of teams have smaller forwards that are going to have to go up against a guy that's his size that can be intimidating. When you actually see him play, you realize he's actually got good foot skills and is a smart player, so he's not just an intimidation factor, he's also a player that can play."


   


  Three of those players who are looking to have that type of increased role this year are Lenawee natives. Sophomores midfielder Alex Hanosh (Adrian) and defender Nicholas Giovannone (Tecumseh), along with junior midfielder/defender Sedrick Yatzek (Adrian) could be seeing the field more as SHU looks to build itself toward the future.


   


  "Between the three of them, I would expect that they will to get more (playing time), Alex for sure," Crawford said. "Cedrick played some significant varsity minutes in our first game. Nick is coming off of a knee injury, so he sat all of last year, so we don't know what exactly to expect from him yet until we can get him into some games and see where he's at physically as well as mentally from playing in a contest that he hasn't played in in 18 months."

A Sudbury family that recently moved farther north to pursue a job opportunity is looking for help after losing everything in a suspicious fire that destroyed their home, their van and most of their belongings.


  Jeseanne Lacasse awoke in the middle of the night on Sept. 13 to breastfeed her seven-month-old daughter. When she looked outside her new Pickle Lake home, she noticed the van parked in the driveway had caught fire.


  "It was really scary," she said. "I just grabbed my daughters and ran out of the house."


  The family ran to a neighbour's house to try to call police because Lacasse had left her phone behind.


  "After we contacted the authorities, I went back to the house, and I was just panicking, standing there watching my house on fire, and crying," she said. "I had no shirt on or anything. We left everything behind."


  The family of four made it out of the house unscathed, but the fire spread from the van to their residence, causing extensive smoke damage and leaving little of their belongings salvageable.


  Lacasse and her boyfriend Matthew Pilon, along with their infant and eight- year-old daughter, are now staying in a motel while they wait for news about housing options.


  Pilon's sister Megan Dupuis, who lives in Sudbury, set up a GoFundMe page to help the family raise money to purchase essential items and get back on their feet. The fundraiser has so far reached about a quarter of its $10,000 goal.


  The family had moved into their new home, which they were renting through Ontario Aboriginal Housing Services, just two nights prior to the incident.


  Lacasse and Pilon packed up their lives and drove over 17 hours to Pickle Lake, which is located about 530 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, so that Pilon could pursue an apprenticeship opportunity as a heavy-duty mechanic.


  When they moved, they only brought the essentials. They purchased new furniture and stocked up on baby formula and other food items because the closest grocery store is about an hour away.


  Most of what they brought with them was still in boxes when the fire started in the early hours of Sunday morning.


  According to a release, officers were dispatched to Lakeview Crescent shortly after 2:30 a.m. on the night of the incident.


  "Pickle Lake OPP are investigating this fire as suspicious," the detachment said. "Officers were also dispatched to a second attempted arson on Lakeview Crescent involving an attempt to light a vehicle on fire. It is unclear if the two incidents are related."


  Earlier in the evening on Sept. 12, Lacasse said that a woman who was quite obviously impaired by alcohol or drugs attempted to walk through the front door of their home.


  The woman was allegedly being "very rude," and asked for a cigarette a few times before leaving. Pilon asked the woman to leave repeatedly, and eventually told her that he hoped she got home safely.


  That night, Lacasse said that she was very nervous.


  "After the fire, neighbours told us that the house we moved into used to be a party house. People used to hang out there and drink," she said.


  "That night, after the woman showed up at our door, I had a weird gut feeling. I kept looking out the window every 20 minutes. I have two daughters, and I was worried. I kept looking out the window, but eventually we ended up falling asleep."


  Later that night, Lacasse awoke to the sound of the van horn blaring.


  The fire damaged major appliances like the washing machine and destroyed other items, including their television, the crib mattress, and their baby swing. The rest of their things suffered severe smoke damage.


  Sgt. James Davis of the OPP said that the incident with the woman is being considered as part of the investigation into the cause of the fire, which is ongoing.


  "We've engaged our crime unit and we are trying to determine the cause," he said. "Arsons are very difficult investigations to start with because a lot of the evidence gets destroyed. We have a couple of persons of interest at this point in time, but no suspects yet."


  Members of the Kenora Forensic Identification Service and the Northwest Region Crime Unit are assisting with the case.


  Dupuis, who set up the GoFundMe account in an effort to help her brother and his family, said that when she heard about the fire, she was initially angry.


  "They had just dropped everything to move far away from home for his apprenticeship, and it was a great opportunity. They weren't even in their home for a week and then someone burns down their car," she said.


  "He is just trying to better their lives. And the fact that they have children - one of whom is an infant - I was super angry when I first heard about it. I am doing a little better now."


  Through a number of generous donations, Dupuis has been able to send the family some supplies, including baby clothes and other essential items.


  However, because Pickle Lake is so far away, some of the bigger items, like a playpen and furniture, are still stored in her basement until she can work out how to transport them to her brother.


  Until then, the GoFundMe is still accepting donations, which will be used for food, clothing, furniture, school supplies and other essentials. The family would also like to put some of the funds towards purchasing a new van.


  Anyone interested in donating can visit the family's GoFundMe page at tinyurl.com/y4vrbenq.

Mullens never looked comfortable under center. From missing open passes, to throwing head-scratching interceptions, Mullens had perhaps his worst game as a professional. Mullens finished the game with 200 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. The first interception he threw came in the red zone, which cost the 49ers points. And the final interception came late in the game and resulted in a pick-6.


  Mullens was eventually benched for CJ Bethard. In his first action since 2018, Bethard went 14 for 19 in the fourth quarter. Bethard gave the 49ers a chance to win the game, but on the final play, a heave into the end zone landed on the ground and not in the hands of a San Francisco receiver.


  For the second game in a row, San Francisco had trouble running the ball. Jerick McKinnon had a team-high 54 yards on 14 carries. As a team, the 49ers rushed for 116 yards on 20 attempts. Perhaps the best run of the evening came on a carry by rookie Brandon Aiyuk. The speedy receiver was able to get into the flat, break a number of tackles and then hurdle a defender on his way to a 38-yard touchdown.

Rather than complain, Bluestar decided to do something about it. She mentioned in a Facebook post that she would like to start a group of volunteers, and quickly received about 200 encouraging responses.


  “I was shocked that people were so excited about it,” Bluestar said. “But at the same time, I did have faith in the community. There’s a lot of things we can disagree on, but I think we can all agree on picking up trash and not having a litter-filled county.”


  Unfortunately, the day after Bluestar started the group, she broke her heel in a car accident. While she has been organizing and attending the events, other volunteers have stepped in for the physical labor.


  “We had so many people going down to Natural Bridges right away and bringing out loads of trash, and also in Murphys and up at White Pines,” she said. “I had people start donating grabbers and buckets, so that whoever was going out could come by my house and grab supplies.”


  Steve Gonzales, the owner of The Garden in Murphys, helped to organize a clean-up event on Murphys Grade Road.


  “It went so well that the next week we did another one and did a lower part of the grade,” Bluestar said. “We had about 10 people show up each time, but still got two huge truckloads full of trash.”


  Bluestar said that she was surprised by how quickly the group had grown.


  “It just grew really organically,” she said. “People are being so amazing.”


  The Calaveras HWY 4 Clean-up Crew Facebook page now has over 800 members. Some have attended scheduled clean-up events, while others have independently picked up trash on their own, often posting pictures to the group’s Facebook page.


  “There’s a place for everyone in the group,” Bluestar said. “If people want to go out and do their own thing, I just want them to have supplies.”


  The Calaveras County Department of Public Works has made some supplies available to the group, including trash pickup tools, orange safety vests and construction signs.


  “Public Works is amazing,” Bluestar said. “They said no matter what events we set up, just let them know as soon as we are planning them, and they’ll set aside stuff for us. And if we need them to order more, they can do that as well.”


  Bluestar said that she hopes to inspire others to help clean up the county and to discourage people from littering. She hopes that people will be less inclined to litter if trash isn’t already present.


  “If we get the trash thing somewhat under control, then we can start doing other things to make the county more beautiful – planting wildflowers, stuff like that,” she said.


  On Sunday, the group held its largest clean-up event so far – the 1st Annual Community Clean Up on Camp Nine Road. Several stations were set up with refreshments and supplies, while roughly 40 volunteers spread out along the length of the roadway, picking up any trash that they came across. Many wore recently made bright yellow t-shirts featuring the group’s name.


  Trucks and trailers were loaded up with old mattresses, appliances, tires and an assortment of other trash to be hauled off to the dump. One volunteer, Jeremy Leonard, even brought an excavator to move some of the larger appliances.


  District 3 Supervisor Merita Callaway was one of many who came out to lend a hand. She previously volunteered on the Murphys Grade Road clean up.


  “It’s interesting how this is happening organically,” Callaway said. “This is something that’s growing, and helping to keep Calaveras clean and green and beautiful. Hopefully, it will stretch to other parts of the county.”


  Callaway said that at the next meeting, the board of supervisors will consider doing something to help the group.


  “I’m hoping on the 13th, when the board comes together, that they’ll allow them to dump all of these appliances and tires and wave the fee,” she said.

Mark Asprogianis of Greeneville works daily toward the goal of turning his hobby and sideline into a full-time job.


  He “bears” down constantly on making that happen. That’s a weak joke that will become more clear (but no less weak) if you read on.


  To help keep the bills paid, he works in the grocery business in Greeneville. When he’s not in the store, he can be found up 11E with his chainsaws, skillfully turning logs or random big hunks of wood into critters … usually bears, but sometimes eagles, alligators, birds, turtles, owls, squirrels and the occasional dog.


  Among Mark’s mix of finished and in-progress chainsaw sculptures, even a nervous-looking hedgehog peeps out across the sawdust layer that covers the ground inside his open-sided shelter where most of the work is done.


  Eventually, Mark swears, there’s going to be a big wooden gorilla in his menagerie. He plans to paint it purple or blue just to grab attention.


  How did a 48-year-old who grew up in the Charlotte, N.C., area and drifted over to Tennessee get into sculpting with a chainsaw? That’s one of the things we talked about when I visited him Monday morning at his Chuckey worksite on 11E, where he has been pursuing his craft about two-and-a-half years.


  If you’ve driven from Greeneville to Johnson City on 11E, you’ve passed and maybe noticed Mark’s workplace to the right. It’s on the far end of the row of metal flea market buildings on past the Chuckey Post Office, Dollar General Store, and Handlebar Grill. You’ll know Mark’s from the wooden bear standing out front, facing the highway, and a sign made on a split log.


  Mark’s critter factory is no-frills, with just a covered work area filled with sawdust and wooden animals, and a table or two. He gets power from a nearby building owned by the landlord who rents him his site.


  Mark learned how to handle a chainsaw through an earlier time of working in the tree-trimming and removal business. During that time he happened to see a man, working on a tree, who took a few moments to skillfully saw out a bear’s head on some of the wood. Mark was impressed, and it set him to thinking how something like that could maybe be turned into a business, and also be a fun pastime.


  Though he does sell his creations, he still thinks of his sculpting as a sideline and hobby, albeit one slowly evolving into a business he hopes can someday be his full-time job.


  He uses multiple chainsaws as sculpting tools, with different sizes of bars to allow for different levels of detail. Some are used for bigger cuts such as those that shape the head and shoulders of a sculpted bear, and other, smaller ones come into play to craft the trickier wooden snouts, ears and surprisingly real-looking eyes of his carved creatures.


  He uses terms such as “dime tip” and “quarter tip” in describing the different saws and bars he uses.


  “People have asked me why I don’t go to Gatlinburg to do this. But there’s a lot of people doing this there already, and I don’t want to have to fight the competition and all the drama that goes with it. I like being out here by myself and doing my work.” Looking around at his little private world of creativity, he says, “This is my hobby and my 401-K, right here.”


  Sculptures can be left in a natural wood color for those who prefer that, but most of Mark’s bears are black. This is achieved not by painting the wood, but by burning it with a blowtorch to blacken it, then sealing in the black under a protective varnish.


  Mark is mostly self-taught, but has learned much from several other people, chiefly Johnson City’s Pete Tucker, a friend he considers his mentor. Mark also is in a carver’s organization in Greeneville, EverGreene Woodcarvers, but has been less active in it since COVID-19 came along.


  Usually, Mark says, the facial features of a sculpture are the hardest to do well because of the close, small nature of the work.


  As a general rule, the larger the piece of wood being worked, the more forgiving it is of errors, according to Mark.


  There are fixes and workarounds that can be employed when essential, such as gluing together damaged portions to be reshaped. The declared ideal for Mark, though, is to do it right the first time so as not to need any sneaky fixes.


  Asked if he angrily kicks sculptures that go wrong due to a large bad cut or other irreparable error, Mark replied that he typically does not kick. He simply cuts the head off the failed sculpture and starts over.


  The biggest sculpture Mark has created to date is a seven-foot sculpted bear in Dandridge. Whenever his planned blue/purple ape is made, he anticipates that will be larger yet.


  The size of a sculpture is limited only by the size of the original wood piece and the skill of the craftsman running the chainsaw. Mark knows another chainsaw sculptor who created a life-sized nativity scene for a church. Mark hasn’t tackled any projects that large just yet, but he’s open to any ideas.


  Much of the wood Mark uses is obtained from his friend Art Fall, of Affordable Tree Service, with a few other sources.


  Mark welcomes visitors who stop by his site when he is there working, and also is glad to take phone calls for information or orders. He may be reached at 865-973-7028. He requests that messages be left in that he often fails to hear phone calls ringing in when he is working with saws, power sanders or other loud equipment.


  As he pursues his full-time carver dream, Mark plans to keep on one-man crewin’ and making those bruins.


  Mark is the father of two grown children from a past marriage. His daughter manages a hotel in Cumberland Gap and his son is in school in Middle Tennessee. Mark has two grandchildren.


  The Asprogianis name (pronounced az-pro-jee-ah-niss) is Greek. Mark’s father, who now lives in Statesville, N.C., is a native of Greece.

Bridget Pettis, an East Chicago native and 1989 E.C. Central High School graduate, has been a part of the WNBA since its inception in 1997.


  The seventh overall pick of the Phoenix Mercury in the inaugural WNBA Draft, she played eight seasons in the association with the Mercury and Indiana Fever, appearing in a franchise-record 154 consecutive games with Phoenix. Over an eight-season career, Pettis scored 1,408 points in 228 games.


  Pettis served as assistant coach with Phoenix from 2006-2009, winning two WNBA championships. She was director of basketball operations from 2010-11 with Phoenix and then an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Sparks in 2013. She joined the Tulsa Shock staff in 2014 and remains in that capacity with the franchise, which relocated to Dallas in 2015.
