Sokratis Papastathopoulos would be a solid presence in defence during Emery's early tenure it was reasoned. Give him a three year, £90,000-a-week contract then even though he would be past his prime entering the final year. Arsenal weren't to know the damage coronavirus would inflict on the transfer market, making it far harder to shift older, high earners, but equally they knew from experience that getting players off their wage bill was easier said than done.
 It is hard not to see the same hallmarks of Sokratis' signing or David Luiz's in the three year deal to Willian, the hope that in year one he will pay back the £100,000-a-week wages and sizeable signing on fee by firing Arsenal to the Champions League places.
 Such an approach has not been enough yet but even if it was the club would still be on the hook for millions more in bonuses and salary. That does not fit with the Kroenkes' vision for a streamlined operation that maximises the value of every pound.
 Since his appointment to the board last month Tim Lewis has been examining ways in which Arsenal can be leaner in their approach. That is the club's stated rationale for parting ways with Sanllehi, that from a governance perspective it makes far more sense for there to be a single ring leader in Vinai Venkatesham.

GALESBURG -- When it comes to important dates in his life, Carson Cheesman recalls them all.
   
 The 25-year-old vividly remembers when he underwent Tommy John surgery on his left elbow.
   
 The 2013 Galesburg High School and 2017 Western Illinois University grad, who played baseball for the Silver Streaks and then the Leathernecks, did so May 11, 2015.
   
 Cheesman sat out the 2016 season after ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction. The procedure was first performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Frank Jobe, then a Los Angeles Dodgers team physician, in 1974 on left-handed pitcher Tommy John, who had a 26-year Major League career, seven with the Dodgers. John pitched for 13 years after recovering from the procedure, earning 164 of his 288 career wins in that span.
   
 After rehabbing and recovering, Cheesman was diagnosed with an olecranon stress reaction, but his UCL looked fine. He only made two appearances in the 2017 season for WIU on the hill as a senior, and Cheesman allowed three hits, two runs -- both earned -- and walked two for a 6.75 ERA in 2 2/3 innings of action.
   
 As a Leatherneck, Cheesman appeared in 14 games (14 innings) -- nine in 2014 as a freshman and three in 2015 as a sophomore. He allowed 13 runs (nine earned) on 13 hits, struck out two and walked 18 for a 5.79 ERA.
   
 "It definitely wasn't the career I wanted to have or I thought I could have had, but it was a blessing in disguise," said Cheesman, who majored in fire science and minored in public administration. "I focused on what was next after baseball. You can only play for so long before you have to move on from baseball. I thought it was kind of a way to move on with the injury. I had a good arm and it just eventually wore out. The doctor gave me a 75% chance that it would be back to what it was or even better, but I was in the 25% were it didn't get any better.
   
 "I knew that if I stopped playing I would be able to use my arm the rest of my life and still throw with my kid when I have one someday," Cheesman added. "That was kind of an eye-opener for me. It was being able to use my arm fully and not have that soreness through it with day-to-day life.
   
 "It's fine now. I can do all kinds of stuff that I want."
   
 Including working for the Moline Fire Department.
   
 "I'm coming up on my two-year mark," said Cheesman, who had a 7-2 record and 0.88 ERA along with 67 strikeouts in 64 innings in his final season as a member of the GHS baseball team. "I got sworn in on Sept. 11, and obviously being in fire service it's a pretty memorable day."
   
 Those who work for the MFD are trained as firefighters and paramedics, and Cheesman loves both aspects of his job.
   
 "We run ambulance calls along with fire calls. We run about 8,000 calls a year," he said. "I think having ambulance we get to help in a lot more ways. We get to be with the patients longer. We can stay with them from the time they have their emergency and then into higher hands.
   
 "I do like the fire side of it, too. Helping people in that way is hard to describe," Cheesman added. "We do water rescues with the Rock River and Mississippi. We have a lot of waterways.
   
 "We do car extractions. We have a lot of interstates that run through that area. Any type of firefighting operations."
   
 In other words, Cheesman wears many different hats.
   
 "Becoming a fireman, you kind of become a jack of all trades," he said. "If you don't know who to call, you call the fire department, and that is kind of a running joke, but you take pride in that. It's an honor and you have to earn people's respect every day.
   
 "You get what you put into it. You have to practice just like athletics. You can't take a day off. You can't have an off day when you're at work."
   
 And just like athletics, there's a family environment.
   
 "The big thing I like about being in fire service is the camaraderie," Cheesman said. "We work 24 hours on and then 48 hours off. We work every third day, so you are with these people a lot."
   
 "You depend on the guys you work with and you train with them, so you trust each other," he added. "Firefighting is different than athletics because you are trusting them with your life. The guys you work with would do anything for you, and they become like a second family."
   
 Cheesman still has a lot to take in.
   
 "I am still on the bottom -- just learning and soaking it up each day," he said. "It is a job where you can't stop learning. No call is ever the same. It can be what you think is a normal call and something different happens. You have to learn from it, and learning from the people before you is a big thing.
   
 "You can't become complacent."

Planning in-person lessons and grading in-person assessments is part of our life's work.
