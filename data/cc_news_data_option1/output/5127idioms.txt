Kevin Durant still can score in bunches.
 The four-time NBA scoring champion returned from a lengthy injury absence to score 15 points in his debut with the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday night.
 Durant ruptured the Achilles tendon in his right leg during the 2019 NBA Finals. He left the Golden State Warriors after that season and joined the Nets, but he missed the entire 2019-20 season while recovering, delaying his chance to play with close friend Kyrie Irving.
 Durant played just under 24 minutes as Brooklyn beat the Washington Wizards 119-114 on Sunday night in its preseason opener.
 ‚ÄúIt felt great to be back in the routine and be back on the floor and feel like a player again," Durant said. "It felt great. Everybody‚Äôs texting and calling and asking me how I‚Äôm feeling. I can‚Äôt wait until that‚Äôs over with so I can get back in the swing of things and just feel like one of the guys again.‚Äù
 Durant looked confident as he donned No. 7 instead of the familiar No. 35 he had worn for Oklahoma City and Golden State. His first basket on Sunday was a driving two-handed dunk.
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one thing to come back," said Steve Nash, the Nets' new coach. "It‚Äôs another thing to come back and look as explosive and mobile and skillful as he has after a long layoff. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of him.‚Äù

Florida‚Äôs next drive ended on one of the most bizarre plays many people have ever seen and resulted in Trask‚Äôs second interception of the game. The pass was intended for wide receiver Kadarius Toney but as he was falling out of bounds, Toney tipped the ball, which then hit LSU freshman cornerback Dwight McGlothern right in the facemask, bounced in the air, and was caught inbounds by Jay Ward. Ward initially dove at the ball before Toney tipped and was on his stomach on the turf when the ball popped up off McGlothern but he had the presence of mind to get on his knees to secure the interception.Ball Don&#39;t Lie...

One of the downsides of playing a really bad team like the Jets ‚Äî and they are breathtakingly bad ‚Äî is that you get little credit for the good things, while the flaws tend to stand out glaringly.
 Fortunately for the Seahawks, there wasn‚Äôt much to complain about in a game that prompted coach Pete Carroll to say afterward, ‚ÄúI'm just really fired up that at this time of year, we're playing our best football.‚Äù
 As a counterpoint, I would repeat two words, which are the linguistic equivalent of a cold shower: The Jets.
 But with that disclaimer out of the way, dominating a game on both sides of the ball as Seattle did certainly beats the alternative. Even if it‚Äôs achieved against the team pursuing the No. 1 draft pick with a single-minded purpose that is aided by a rare confluence of incompetent leadership, subpar talent and waning motivation.
