Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on 'Mann Ki Baat' in the 68th edition of his monthly radio programme at 11 AM on Sunday.
 PM Modi had sought ideas and suggestions from people on Twitter earlier this month about topics for his radio programme where he addresses the country and range of issues.
 The Prime Minister had tweeted to ask people to send their inputs by writing to him using NaMo or MyGov App or by recording their messages by calling on 1800-11-7800. Phone lines have been opened from August 10.
 In the previous edition of Mann ki Baat, which was also a date when India celebrates Kargil Vijay Diwas, PM Modi had paid tributes to soldier who fought valiantly against Pakistan's forces during the Kargil War. He also said that despite efforts to establish cordial relations Pakistan remained resolute in pushing cross-border terrorism.
   
   
 PM Modi also reminded citizens to not let their guard down amid the rising cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He said that it is necessary to wear masks when outside and asked those who think wearing them is troublesome to reflect upon the amount of time frontline workers have to spend in a day wearing masks. He reiterated that people need to follow all precautions to prevent Covid-19.
 "At many places, Covid-19 is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning - that's why we have to be cautious," PM Modi had said.

The Youth Congress on Saturday launched a 'Rozgar Do' (Give Jobs) campaign in a bid to reach out to the unemployed youth.
 As part of the nationwide campaign, Youth Congress president Srinivas B V said the activists will hold protests in front of residences and offices of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarians and ministers across the country and also launch signature and letter campaigns to demand jobs for the unemployed youth.
 He said the Youth Congress will also stage a 'Parliament Gherao" to press for their demands.
 "Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says that the impact on the economy is due to coronavirus pandemic, but it's actually lack of vision which has led to unemployment due to wrong policies of the Modi government," Srinivas said, launching the campaign at the Congress headquarters in Delhi.
   
   
 A song for the 'Rozgar Do' campaign was also released in different Indian languages. The Youth Congress activists will also organise wall writing and poster making on the unemployment issue, Srinivas added.
 All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Krishna Allaveru accused the ruling BJP government of "destroying" the economy even before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 "Demonetisation, flawed GST and an unplanned lockdown in March, despite warnings of an 'economic tsunami' by Rahul Gandhi were not act of God but the policies and decisions of the Modi government that have led to unemployment among the youth," he said.
 Party's national spokesperson Pawan Khera said the unemployment had assumed "fearsome" proportions before the Covid-19 and claimed that around 135 million youth are likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.
 "A record of 45 years of unemployment has been broken," he added. "We keep warning the government but they are not bothered."

MADRID (AP) — Barcelona is unwavering in its intention to keep Lionel Messi, who told the club earlier this week that he wanted to leave.
 Spanish media say Messi has contacted the club to try to resolve the situation, but Barcelona confirmed to the Associated Press on Saturday that it will not negotiate to allow the Argentina great to depart before his contract ends next year.
 Earlier this week, Messi said he wanted to invoke a contract clause that allowed him to leave at the end of last season, but the club said the clause had already expired.
 A lengthy legal battle may ensue as the 33-year-old forward is expected to say the clause was valid until the end of the season, which was pushed back because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Barcelona is not willing to give up on the player, especially not for free. Messi’s contract, which ends in June 2021, has a buyout clause of 700 million euros ($831 million). He has been with the club for nearly two decades, leading it to more than three-dozen titles and holding most of its individual records.
 Spanish media said Messi and his team contacted the club late this week to try to discuss his situation. He had announced his intention to leave by sending the club a burofax, a certified document similar to a telegram.

The guy we had quarterbacking (Jackson Champion) doesn't have as many reps and can’t read it as well. But he plays hard and he’s young.”
 The Tigers, after turning the Bulldogs away on their first possession of the second quarter, appeared to be stringing a drive together only to have the ball squirt out of the hands of their running back and into the open arms of Holtville’s Brady Webster.
 Holtville used that fortuitous swing of momentum and put another score on the board. The Bulldogs managed to find the end zone, despite shooting themselves in the foot early with a holding penalty.

 Things in the Granite City were bad enough in the wake of the decision to reimpose a local lockdown without a group of Derek McInnes’ players breaching coronavirus protocols.
 A wave of criticism crashed down on the Dons culprits as politicians, fans and pundits lined up to take a swipe, with the club left playing catch up after seeing three games postponed.
 Thankfully for McInnes, Hampden disciplinary chiefs have shown mercy on Jonny Hayes, Scott McKenna, Sam Cosgrove, Craig Bryson, Bruce Anderson, Dylan McGeouch, Matty Kennedy and Michael Devlin after deciding to issue each only a suspended three-match ban.
 Now with the storm clouds clearing, Lewis is hoping his side can chart a route to calmer waters as they look to build on three straight wins when they take on Hibernian at Easter Road on Sunday.
 The Reds goalkeeper said: “It’s been the most turbulent time for every football club in the world so we’re not too different.
 “Obviously the issue we had a few weeks ago with the eight boys clearly didn’t help. The lads made a mistake and it was a mistake. There was no malice involved, they are all good lads.

Michigan surpassed the 100,000 mark for known coronavirus cases on Friday.
 On Aug. 28, the University of Michigan announced it’s identified two students that tested positive for COVID-19, Michigan’s Attorney General says she’s horrified by the 42-to-62 year sentence a man, now with COVID-19, is serving for a 1994 marijuana charge and Smart Helmets that use thermal energy to read your temperature are being tested at Flint’s Bishop Airport.
 Here’s the latest on how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting people across the state.
 Michigan surpasses 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases
 If it were a country, the Midwest state would rank 31st in the world in confirmed COVID-19 cases -- ahead of significantly larger countries like China, Japan, Egypt and Poland, as well as countries with more-similar populations like Sweden, the Dominican Republic and Belgium, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 On Friday, Aug. 28, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reported 741 new cases and six new deaths linked to COVID-19.
 The additions pushed the state’s known totals to 100,699 cases and 6,446 deaths over the course of 24 weeks. That’s not including the 10,385 probable coronavirus cases and 266 probable coronavirus deaths reported by the health department.
 In a Friday afternoon statement about eclipsing the 100,000-case mark, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer touted the state’s aggressive action against the virus, noting that those actions put Michigan in a better spot than states that “closed down late and reopened early.”
 “But our work is far from over,” Whitmer said. “The COVID-19 pandemic is still a very real threat to our families, our brave frontline workers, and our economy.

 Michigan AG ‘horrified’ by Michael Thompson’s 42- to 62-year sentence for 1994 marijuana case
 Michigan’s treatment of marijuana is illogical and contradictory.
 That’s a sentiment Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel shared as she explained how she became involved in an effort to free Michael Thompson, a 69-year-old Flint native essentially serving a life prison sentence in a state where marijuana is now legal to possess, grow and sell.
 Nessel fielded a myriad of marijuana-related questions from Cannabis Caucus of Michigan member and legalization champion Rick Thompson during a public Facebook live conversation Friday, Aug. 28.
 The first question regarded Thompson, who’s serving a 42- to 62-year sentence after he was convicted of selling three pounds of marijuana to an undercover informant in December 1994. His sentence was compounded by prior felony convictions, including another drug crime in 1983 and for bringing contraband into a prison in 1986 and the discovery of a gun during the investigation.
 Thompson has spent 23 years behind bars and isn’t eligible for parole until he’s 87.

LONDON (AP) — Street artist Banksy has released a video with a strong political message explaining why he became involved in a search-and- rescue ship helping migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. “Like most people who make it in the art world, I bought a yacht to cruise the Med,” the artist wrote in captions accompanying the video, which was posted to his Instagram account Saturday. “It’s a French Navy vessel we converted into a lifeboat.” “Because EU authorities deliberately ignore distress calls from ’non- Europeans',” the subversive artist continued. “All Black Lives Matter.” The video featured footage of migrants at sea and clips of the vessel, called the MV Louise Michel, which is painted bright pink. The Louise Michel crew has said it is sponsored by Banksy, whose real name remains a mystery. Details of his financial involvement were not available. The crew has in recent days reported picking up several groups of migrants in the central Mediterranean in what appeared to be its maiden rescue voyage. In a series of tweets over the past few days, the ship’s crew has strongly criticized the European Union over its migration policy. It said it contacted both Italian and Maltese coast guards seeking a port to disembark migrants, but received no response. The tone of the tweets has grown more urgent in the past 24 hours after the crew reported that the numbers of migrants on board were getting too high, that the ship was essentially stranded and that the crew was seeking a port to disembark the passengers. It reported women and children were among the dozens on board and in an adjacent dinghy, as well as the corpse of a migrant. “We need immediate assistance,” the crew tweeted via its @MVLouiseMichel handle on Saturday. “We are safeguarding...

 Critics, including new-car dealers, say that allowing state registration will only encourage more southbound car trafficking. Elorduy, the president of Coparmex Mexicali, a local organization for business owners, said the problem needs to be addressed more holistically.
 He said Mexican customs agents are not supposed to allow unregistered California vehicles to enter the country, but “Mexico has a very porous border and corrupt customs system, and it’s been corrupt for generations.”
 They are also often permitted by U.S. customs agents to cross back northbound into the United States on a daily basis when the owners of the cars work north of the border, even though it’s technically illegal.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation on 'Mann Ki Baat' in the 68th edition of his monthly radio programme at 11 AM on Sunday. PM Modi had sought ideas and suggestions from people on Twitter earlier this month about topics for his radio programme where he addresses the country and range of issues. The Prime Minister had tweeted to ask people to send their inputs by writing to him using NaMo or MyGov App or by recording their messages by calling on 1800-11-7800. Phone lines have been opened from August 10.In the previous edition of Mann ki Baat, which was also a date when India celebrates Kargil Vijay Diwas, PM Modi had paid tributes to soldier who fought valiantly against Pakistan's forces during the Kargil War. He also said that despite efforts to establish cordial relations Pakistan remained resolute in pushing cross-border terrorism.PM Modi also reminded citizens to not let their guard down amid the rising cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). He said that it is necessary to wear masks when outside and asked those who think wearing them is troublesome to reflect upon the amount of time frontline workers have to spend in a day wearing masks. He reiterated that people need to follow all precautions to prevent Covid-19."At many places, Covid-19 is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning - that's why we have to be cautious," PM Modi had said.

We love the fact of how rainbow hues or unicorn colours can play up any dull vibe. Monotones are subtle and powerful but sprucing up once in a while with some colours in tow is just what Raashi Khanna seems to have on her mind in the throwback photoshoot. She clearly seems to be telling us - why have just one colour when you can rain them all in? While combining different colours and hues to create a more modest colour pair with contemporary western ensembles is a tricky trend to confront, Raashi goes on to give us a glimpse of how to create the perfect style harmony. Raashi Khanna regaled with her multi-hued just before the lockdown vibe. For a photoshoot, Raashi took to flaunting a multicoloured hoodie. She allowed the outfit to take centre-stage being perched on a chair and keeping it relevant with a subtle beauty game in tow. Raashi Khanna debuted with Shoojit Sircar's _Madras Cafe_ in 2013. She transitioned down South into the Telugu and Tamil film industry. She is counted amongst the sartorial stunners there, having maintained a fine temperament of chic styles from home labels as a staple.

Aberdeen have been regular challengers for Scottish football’s ‘best of the rest’ tag since McInnes took over seven years ago – but this season it is Hibernian who have taken the fight to the Old Firm as they sit joint top of the table five games in.
 Lewis said: “It’s very early in the season and the league table takes a while to even out. People have good starts, others have poor starts.
 “Certainly Hibs will be looking to challenge us at the top end of the table so this will be a big game.
 “They have started very well and have some good players. It’s going to be a test, that’s for sure. It’s not going to make or break either team’s season.
 “Hibs are in good form but we are too. We’re confident going into the game.”

As the wind howled and the rain slammed down, a team of nurses, respiratory therapists and a doctor worked through the night to care for 19 tiny babies as Hurricane Laura slammed southwestern Louisiana.
 The babies, some on ventilators or eating through a feeding tube, seemed to weather the storm just fine, said Dr. Juan Bossano, the medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital for Women.
 “They did very well. They tolerated it very well. We had a very good day,” he said.
 Laura made landfall early Thursday morning as a Category 4 storm, packing top winds of 150 mph (241 kph), and pushing a storm surge as high as 15 feet in some areas.
 Hours before it made landfall, officials had to move the babies from the women’s hospital to the main hospital in the system after it became clear that storm surge could inundate the women’s hospital, located on the southern end of Lake Charles. The hospital has its own generator and hospital administrator Alesha Alford said it was built to withstand hurricane force winds. But in the single story facility, there's no room to move up and storm surge in that area was expected to hit nine feet.
 In a roughly two-hour operation the babies in the intensive care unit were transferred by ambulance to Lake Charles Memorial Hospital, a ten-story facility on the northern side of the city. Trucks carried needed equipment such as incubators.

Connections of Judicial will consider the Betfair Sprint Cup at Haydock next weekend, but the veteran is more likely to run at York a day later.
 The eight-year-old has arguably been in the form of his life this season, winning the Chipchase Stakes at Newcastle and defying a penalty in fine style in a Listed race at Chester most recently.
 While he has come up short in Group One company before, should the field cut up and conditions suit, then trainer Julie Camacho could give the green light.
 “We’re going to have a cursory look at the Haydock sprint just to make sure all the main protagonists stand their ground and are fit and well – and of course we hope they are,” said Steve Brown, Camacho’s partner and assistant.
 “But he’s most likely to go to the Garrowby Stakes at York, which is the sort of six-furlong race which fits well in his profile now. We could just do with it drying up.
 “He’s had a good year and if we had to turn his attentions to the all-weather further down the line, we will, but it’s very difficult to plan as we’ve only got the programme for September in front of us, but that how it is – we’ve got to get on and do our best.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Haneef Salaam spent the early years of his adulthood in and out of prison, first for drug distribution, then for probation violations that landed him back in jail multiple times. Being a young Black man from the Southbridge area of Wilmington during the crack epidemic, the odds were already stacked against him. Poverty leads to crime, Mr. Salaam said, and without fair economic opportunities and resources available, what options are there for urban communities? “Poverty breeds crime and violence,\" said Mr. Salaam, 41. “African Americans have been neglected equal economic opportunities for a long, long time. While there are opportunities to gain employment, when you look at a livable wage or a livable salary, a salary that one can live off of and also save and build off of, those opportunities are few and far between for African Americans, with or without a criminal background.” Before his then-girlfriend, Qaadirah — who is now his wife — gave birth to their first daughter 17 years ago, Mr. Salaam’s life looked very different. Now, for the past 15 years, he has been working for local nonprofits to help formerly incarcerated individuals like himself reintegrate into society and find success. Mr. Salaam said he’s in the unique position of being able to effectively communicate with urban communities, while also connecting them to professionals who can provide aid. “I actually think knowing the criminal justice system and just having a firm understanding of urban communities, or ‘the hood’ as I would typically say, is one of my gifts,” Mr. Salaam said. “Because of my desire to be a professional and engage in this work, I now have the unique ability to be relatable and effectively communicate in two different societies,...

Trump is hoping for a late development that could be a campaign game-changer: The release of a vaccine that would mark the beginning of the end of the pandemic on his watch, before Americans vote. His administration has been doing everything it can to accelerate the process, along with hyping new therapeutics, even when it's not clear they work. “We’ll produce a vaccine before the end of the year, or maybe even sooner,” he said in his convention keynote. It’s unclear, however, whether science can deliver on his timetable.

 HOW IMPORTANT ARE THE DEBATES?
 They're crucial.
 The conventions largely succeeded in fulfilling both campaigns’ objectives, so the debates -- scheduled for Sept. 29, Oct. 15 and Oct. 22 -- will be the most high-profile opportunities for the candidates to highlight contrasts, animate core supporters and cajole the small but critical slice of persuadable voters.
 Biden and his team say they relish the idea of confronting Trump face to face. “The debates will give the V.P. the chance to call Trump on all of his B.S.,” Richmond said.
 It also will be another chance for the 77-year-old Democrat to work to dismantle Trump’s framing that Biden is too old for the job. Richmond said that narrative could backfire on Trump, himself a 74-year-old who regularly mangles syntax and offers meandering answers.
 Some in Trump’s camp seem to agree. After months of trying to cast Biden as feeble and mentally diminished, they're now talking up Biden’s abilities as a way to try to lower expectations on Trump's side.
 “Joe Biden is really good at debates,” Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller has been saying, portraying Biden as much more skilled than Hillary Clinton.

The Youth Congress on Saturday launched a 'Rozgar Do' (Give Jobs) campaign in a bid to reach out to the unemployed youth.
 As part of the nationwide campaign, Youth Congress president Srinivas B V said the activists will hold protests in front of residences and offices of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) parliamentarians and ministers across the country and also launch signature and letter campaigns to demand jobs for the unemployed youth.
 He said the Youth Congress will also stage a 'Parliament Gherao" to press for their demands.
 "Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman says that the impact on the economy is due to coronavirus pandemic, but it's actually lack of vision which has led to unemployment due to wrong policies of the Modi government," Srinivas said, launching the campaign at the Congress headquarters in Delhi.
 A song for the 'Rozgar Do' campaign was also released in different Indian languages. The Youth Congress activists will also organise wall writing and poster making on the unemployment issue, Srinivas added.
 All India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Krishna Allaveru accused the ruling BJP government of "destroying" the economy even before the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 "Demonetisation, flawed GST and an unplanned lockdown in March, despite warnings of an 'economic tsunami' by Rahul Gandhi were not act of God but the policies and decisions of the Modi government that have led to unemployment among the youth," he said.
 Party's national spokesperson Pawan Khera said the unemployment had assumed "fearsome" proportions before the Covid-19 and claimed that around 135 million youth are likely to lose their jobs due to the pandemic.
 "A record of 45 years of unemployment has been broken," he added. "We keep warning the government but they are not bothered."
