The 27-year-old has lost his regular first-team spot under United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and was limited to nine league starts in the 2019-20 season.


  "This season has been difficult for so many reasons," Lingard said in an Instagram post on Tuesday.


  "I lost who I was as a player and person, but I never wanted to give up, I knew who I really was on and off the pitch and knew that having been there before I could get there again.


  "This meant working harder than I'd ever done before and trusting in those around me that they knew how to best help me achieve that."


  In an interview with the Daily Mail last December, Lingard said he took on greater responsibility for his younger siblings after his mother became unwell earlier in the season.


  Lingard also said he had feared for his United future after posting a bizarre video on social media with team mate Marcus Rashford before the start of the last campaign.


  "I know the fans have been frustrated but in all this time my love for this club and everyone connected to it has never left me," Lingard, a United academy graduate, said.


  "This team, this club is my family and I will continue to keep working harder than ever to help this team achieve its goals."


  Lingard has been linked in the media with a move away from United in the current transfer window, having less than a year remaining on his contract.

Lubbock- Ann Burke Rowley passed away suddenly on Friday, July 24, 2020, after a brief hospitalization. She had suffered from multiple medical issues for the last few years and is now at peace with her husband Milton "Mac" Rowley, who passed away last September. The family will host a time of fellowship and remembrance from 6 pm-8 pm, Thursday, July 30, 2020, at Lake Ridge Chapel and Memorial Designers. Attendees will be asked to socially distance and wear a mask when possible. A mass to celebrate her life of 78 years is scheduled at 10 am, Friday, July 31, 2020, at St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church.Ann Patrice was born to Lawrence "Larry" and Jane Wall Burke on September 22, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of 5 children. She is preceded in death by her husband, her parents, and her brothers Lawrence, Edward, and Patrick and is survived by her sister Jane Burke Kleinheinz of Lake Oswego, Oregon. She graduated from St. Scholastica High School in Chicago, Illinois, in 1959. That fall, Ann matriculated at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. Legend has it that Ann met her future husband, Mac Rowley, the first week at Creighton in the fall of 1959. She started dating the tall, handsome, slightly unpolished boy from Clovis, NM, that first week of college, and although there were significantly more men than women enrolled at Creighton in those years, she never looked back. Ann graduated from Creighton University in 1963 with a B.S.M.T degree, and she and Mac were married on August 10, 1963, at St Mary of the Woods Church in Chicago, IL. Ann began working as a medical technologist in Omaha until Mac received his Medical degree in 1964.Ann kept busy having and raising three children in four years while Mac was a surgery resident at Creighton. Jane was born in 1964, Mike, in 1966 and Susan in 1968. If that wasn't enough work, Mac was then a surgeon in the United States Air Force, so the young family moved to Misawa, Japan, from 1969-1972. Those years in Japan were a source of many fond memories of travel, fun, and friendships that lasted a lifetime. At that point, Mac decided he would pursue training in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, so once again, Ann packed up and moved the family of 5 into a two- bedroom apartment in New York City while Mac completed his training for two more years. Finally, after 11 years of marriage, in 1974, Mac got a real job, and the family settled for good in Lubbock, TX. Ann then had a real home, and she began to get involved heavily in local charities, politics and also become the practice manager for her husband's medical office. She was very active in the Lubbock Women's Club, serving on many committees over the years, and was also a past president of the L.W.C. She was involved in the L.C.G. county medical auxiliary, including serving as past president. She was very active in the Lubbock Symphony Guild and was co-chairman of the Symphony Ball in 1987. She volunteered as a host family for Reese Air Force base in the early 1990s. She volunteered for the ARCS Foundation and the Adult daycare center. She was also heavily involved in Republican politics and a member of the Lubbock Area Republican Women and served as a local precinct chairman. She was also involved in her church and served on the Altar Society at St. Elizabeth's Church as well as the council of Catholic women. As the kids left for college and careers, Ann and Mac began to travel extensively as a couple and with friends, domestically and abroad. Their passion for travel lasted for decades, and they traveled to almost every corner of the globe. Ann is survived by her children Jane Rowley and her husband Randy Kinnison; Mike Rowley and his wife Carolyn and Susan Rowley; grandchildren Annie, Katie, and Ellie Kinnison; Meg and John Rowley; and Matt SlowikThe family would like to thank Ashely and Sandy for their care of Ann, especially after Mac passed away last year. The family of Ann Burke Rowley chose the Buddy Holly Hall of Performing Arts and Sciences or the Lubbock Women's Club Historical Foundation for dedications in her memory.

Chandigarh (Punjab) India July 29 (ANI/NewsVoir): Bow Valley College in Calgary, Alberta, is a publicly funded College that has announced a pathway program with Chitkara University, India, in the faculty of healthcare for students.


  Chitkara students who have graduated from any stream of healthcare programs can now transfer to the Health & Human Services Management (HHSM) one-year post-diploma certificate at Bow Valley College through Chitkara University.


  Eligible candidates will be offered a letter of acceptance from Bow Valley College in Canada. The students will apply for their study permit and go through four weeks of orientation programming at Chitkara University, before coming to Canada.


  Nursing and healthcare programs are much sought after and completing them offers promising careers in Canada. Amid uncertain circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, this pathway ensures that students can continue to achieve their international study goals during this time.


  The first cohort under the HHSM post-diploma certificate arrangement is expected to start in January 2021, based on the easing of travel and other restrictions in Canada.


  An innovative healthcare program, HHSM combines elements of business study and managing the Canadian Health system to prepare students for management positions in the Canadian healthcare sector.


  Students who will graduate from Bow Valley College will be eligible to apply for a post-graduate work permit in Canada or even pursue other diploma programs from Bow Valley College or a degree with a public university pathway partner.


  "This partnership is a significant step in providing our international learners with a seamless pathway leading to a unified system of lifelong learning. We offer global education with learning outcomes aligned to industry-validated competencies and skills in healthcare. International students are an important part of Bow Valley College's student body, and this announcement reflects their importance to Canada and our local community. We continue to shape the future of education and make all learning count through leading practices and partnerships," said Dr Misheck Mwaba, Bow Valley College's Vice President, Academic about this innovative pathway.


  "The pathway program is being launched at a very appropriate time. Given the current situation, students will be able to continue their education while keeping their dreams of international education intact. We have a formidable and robust faculty of Healthcare at Chitkara University that spans across programs of Nursing, Optometry, Pharma programs, allied healthcare etc. Canada is a favourable and rewarding choice for healthcare careers, and our partnership with Bow Valley College in Canada will help our students realize their dreams of studying and working in Canada while serving humanity," said Dr Madhu Chitkara, Chitkara University's Pro-chancellor.


  This initiative opens the door for Indian students to equip themselves with the skill sets and education that is required to work in a stringent and highly regulated healthcare sector in Canada.


  There is a gap in the demand and supply of foreign-educated healthcare workers in Canada and education from a public college like Bow Valley can significantly help address the need for Canadian educated healthcare professionals to fill different positions in the healthcare sector, be it in the province of Alberta or anywhere in Canada.

  Former presidential candidate and FDC founding president Dr Kizza Besigye yesterday declared he is still in the struggle to liberate Uganda and will only leave when the job that brought him into the struggle is accomplished.


  Dr Besigye said many are wondering whether he is going to contest for presidency for the fifth time against President Museveni in 2021.


  However, he warned that nobody invited him in the struggle for regime change in Uganda and, therefore, people should stop focusing on him and rather concentrate on the purpose.


  “There is confusion in the public on whether Besigye is coming again. Do not focus on me, you should keep your eyes on the ball. Is there anybody who invited me in this fight or is there anyone who invited you here? Everybody is invited in the struggle with their conscience,” Dr Besigye said yesterday at the ceremony where FDC was unveiling Kampala Lord Mayor Erias Lukwago as their new member.


  Mr Lukwago, formerly of Democratic Party, was unveiled yesterday at a ceremony held at the FDC offices in Najjanankumbi, a Kampala suburb.


  “We all came here to fight until the job is done. Me who brought myself here will fight until the job is done. By the way, my eyes are not on the office but on the freedom and equality of all Ugandans where we can share the wealth of this country equally,” Dr Besigye charged.

And the teenager, who arrived from Everton last summer having also been in the Manchester United Academy as a youngster, admitted the step-up had been a learning curve.


  “I have learnt lots of things from training every day and being around the dressing room," said the 18-year-old, speaking to Burnley's official website.


  "As a striker I learnt lots off Jay (Rodriguez). He gave me really good advice on how to work together with your strike partner on and off the ball.


  “Westy (Ashley Westwood) and (Phil) Bardsley set a great example of working your absolute hardest every day in training and I feel this has definitely rubbed off on all the young players.


  "Every player works their hardest in training for each other and you can see it on match days.”


  The forward is contracted at Turf Moor until next summer and is highly thought of by the coaching staff at the club.


  He was a key part of the Clarets side that reached the last eight of the FA Youth Cup and has proved capable of stepping up to the Under-23 set-up.

  The change certainly makes sense too. EA stripped "fitness" out of their NHL 'HUT' mode years ago. Madden's Ultimate Team went in the same direction; MUT now simply refreshes player stamina back to the max '99' after every match.

Most brokerages have maintained neutral or sell ratings on Nestle India after COVID-led disruptions impacted the company's June quarter result. Domestic revenue of the company grew 2.6% year-on-year in the June quarter, the lowest in 17 quarters. However, it still managed to report a 11.14% growth in net profit to Rs 486.60 crore. Antique Stock Broking and Jefferies maintained `hold’ while Haitong Securities and Motilal Oswal maintained neutral recommendation. Elara and Kotak maintained reduce rating. Emkay maintained sell but CLSA downgraded the stock to sell from underperform. Nestle India had a somewhat disappointing show, possibly on the back of concentrated production, supply constraints and high urban exposure, said CLSA. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as it believes Nestle's PE of 64 times on FY21 estimates is expensive. Motilal Oswal has also cited rich valuations as the reason for maintaining neutral stance. Jefferies said Nestle's June quarter numbers appear lacklustre in the context of strong and double digit growth reported by most peers in the packaged foods space. Nestle is a strong franchise and rides on the packaged food theme, valuation at 71 times CY21 (calendar year 2021) already capture this, said Jefferies. While most have neutral or sell stance, Investec has upgraded Nestle and increased target price to Rs 17,079 from Rs 16,019. Investec expects Nestle's earnings growth trajectory to accelerate going forward given a greater in-home packed food and beverage consumption trend driving key categories and lower raw material prices aiding operating margins.

I have read one particular lengthy post on reddit that I find very interesting — it’s basically somebody else’s version of this article you’re reading now, breaking down the end of “Dark.” Though I don’t agree with all of its conclusions, it certainly provides some food for thought, particularly in the part about the final paradox with Jonas and Martha and Tannhaus’s family. You can read that here.

Another dark horse that likes the steep stuff, and one that despite his age continues to learn and impress in the big one-day races. The _puncheur_ 's last day of racing ended with him being carried away from Paris-Nice with a broken leg, but having performed well in the virtual world during lockdown will hope to be in the running when the real business returns.

Before we jump into the nuts and bolts of season 3, it’s important to understand that there is really no way to conclude a story like this in a way that would be satisfying in a normal way. The reason for this is because “Dark” is full of bootstrap paradoxes. That’s the term that describes, to cite one example from the show, how Charlotte could be her own grandmother.
