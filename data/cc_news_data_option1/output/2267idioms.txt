Leonardo Goi said in our review, "Patrick Vollrath’s _7500_ is a one-room, one-man show. It asks you to spend 92 minutes inside the cockpit of an Airbus A319, and in intimate quarters with a young first officer who must land it back to safety once the aircraft is hijacked by a group of Islamist terrorists. It is, for the best part of its brisk running time, a stomach- churning ride that bursts with the same force and anxieties of another recent–but far superior–single-setting drama: Steven Knight’s _Locke_. Much like Knight’s sophomore directorial work, it seesaws between claustrophobic and expansive, a testament to how much can be achieved in a location spanning a handful of square meters. Take it as a real-time thriller, an intelligently crafted study in cinematic minimalism, and _7500_ works. The trouble starts when Vollrath’s feature debut (a follow-up to his 2015 Oscar-nominated short _Everything Will Be Okay_ ) attempts the landing. High above the clouds is where _7500_ feels most visceral; but when the hijacking narrows down to a face-off between pilot and terrorist, things hit a cliché-riddled, insipid terrain."
