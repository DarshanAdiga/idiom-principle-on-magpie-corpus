Even during good times, community theaters get by on a shoestring budget. Reopening in a limited capacity likely won't be enough for some to cover expenses, and even reopening fully doesn't guarantee that the resources will be there to start again.

Partition is India’s own fracture, a wound to rival Germany’s memory of World War II. More than a million people may have died as a direct result of the cleaving of India, though a number has never been agreed on. People were butchered in cold blood and died on the road and of illness and hunger in the camps afterward. Widespread sexual violence, hushed up then, continues to come to light. The resultant ill feeling poisons India-Pakistan relations to this day.

LEAGUE : The NRL hopes of Toowoomba’s next generation of players have received a shot in the arm.
 Despite the coronavirus pandemic playing havoc with the current NRL season, ARL Commission chairman Peter V’landys is pushing ahead with expansion plans as soon as 2022.
 V’landys believes a 17th team is needed and his preferred destination is south east Queensland.
 The announcement at the weekend has been welcomed by the Toowoomba Rugby League.
 “Another team means more opportunity for players to live out their dreams in the NRL,” TRL chairman Rex Zeeman said.
 “Having another team in Brisbane or south east Queensland doesn’t guarantee Toowoomba players anything but it’s another 30 contracts out there that need to be filled.
 “It’s a step in the right direction provided they do it the right way.”
 Zeeman, who accepted the role of TRL Chairman earlier this year, hopes the biggest positive from NRL expansion will be seen at a grassroots level.
 “I think teams like the Mustangs stand to benefit the most and I hope they do,” he said.
 “We (the TRL) have been behind their Instrust Cup bid from the beginning and NRL expansion.
 “They (the Mustangs) might be able to get on board with the new team.
 “In the past people have shown concern about an Instrust Cup team here – they think it might be a drain on local player talent.
 “I don’t see it that way.
 “Someone like the Mustangs can only take on so many players and they may have to look outside the region when recruiting.
 “But those players that don’t line up for them on the weekend come back to the TRL and strengthen it.
 “It’s also another opportunity for the local players to try and test themselves at another level of the game.”

For the most part, though, the Chinese let the government get on with what is seen as being its business. This includes letting it control practically every part of their lives, as long as they feel they’re being looked after and their interests protected—among other things, a high level of personal safety and access to the benefits of China’s economic growth. To a people accustomed to having the state take care of things like this, the way the pandemic has shaken out at home is very much par for the course.

Sri Lanka are preparing to host India for a limited-overs series in July.
 However, India's cricket board has said it will wait for more clarity regarding curbs on international travel before making a decision on the tour.
 On Saturday, South Africa also allowed training and playing of professional non-contact sport, a decision welcomed by its cricket board.
 "This is a big boost for the operational side of our cricket," Cricket South Africa's (CSA) acting chief executive, Jacques Faul, said in a statement.
 CSA's COVID-19 steering committee will meet on Monday to draw up a protocol for the return to training and playing, he added.
 On Saturday, Britain allowed elite competitive sport in England to resume behind closed doors from Monday, in compliance with strict conditions.

Germany hadn’t faced a challenge of the pandemic’s magnitude since “German reunification, no, since the Second World War.” Any response to it demanded “action in a spirit of solidarity.” All action was being taken in consultation with experts. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI), Germany’s federal health organization, was explicitly name-checked. “There is still neither a way to treat the coronavirus, nor is there a vaccine,” Merkel said. As long as that remained true, all that mattered was to slow the virus down, “flatten the curve over the course of several months, and buy time” so more people wouldn’t die in a health system that couldn’t cope.

A tweet from the president that discussed mail-in ballots was labeled as an "unsubstantiated claim" by Twitter. When Trump tweeted, "There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent," a bright blue sentence was added by the social media platform at the bottom of the tweet. The link said, "Get the facts about mail-in ballots." The label led to a Twitter Events page, which said, "Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud."
