Em um artigo publicado em janeiro de 2016, Nuno Fernandes, professor na escola de administração suíça IMD, escreveu: “Assim como na série _Guerra dos Tronos_ , o inverno está chegando. Apenas alguns unicórnios vão sobreviver, e deve haver uma era de retorno aos princípios básicos” — ou seja, empresas precisam dar lucro. De forma pouco surpreendente para os conservadores, são justamente as empresas rentáveis, preparadas para os desafios escondidos na próxima esquina, as mais preparadas para o mundo pós-coronavírus. O investidor japonês Masayoshi Son, que dizia mirar os próximos 300 anos ao apostar em empresas como WeWork e Uber, prevê perder 16 bilhões de dólares com a pandemia. Muitos de seus negócios não sobreviverão 300 dias, que dirá anos. Nada melhor, para chegar ao próximo oásis, do que um passo seguro após o outro.

Marseille and Nice have both made enquiries for Valencia midfielder Kangin Lee, according to reports.
 Plaza Deportiva cite L’Equipe as reporting that Marseille have proposed a loan deal with an option to buy for the midfielder who is out of contract at the Mestalla in 2020.
 It had been thought the 19-year-old – capped three times by South Korea – is highly valued at the club and they see him as a future star, with Gols Media saying they had reassured him on first-team opportunities.
 Lee joined Los Che’s academy as a 10-year-old in the summer of 2011 and six years later received his first call-up to the club’s B team.
 In October 2018, the midfielder became the youngest Korean player to play professional football in Europe as he made his first-team debut against Ebro in the Copa del Rey.
 He made his La Liga debut three months later when he replaced Denis Cheryshev, becoming the second youngest player to feature in that season’s La Liga after Ander Barrenetxea of Real Sociedad.
 Lee was officially handed the club’s number 16 jersey that month and has now made 27 first-team appearances – including five in this season’s Champions League.

Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro brought an Israeli flag to a rally on Sunday that called for shutting down the country's Supreme Court and Congress. Leading Brazilian Jewish organizations say that including the flag sends a false message about the Jewish community's feelings toward the president, who has come under fire for a political scandal and his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
