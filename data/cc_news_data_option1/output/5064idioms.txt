We are not sure whether the patent will see the light of the day. However, modular phones have not exactly been successful. Motorola offered Moto mods on phones like the Moto Z. The list included power back, style shell with support for wireless charging, and much more. The modular concept has always looked great on paper but the idea never took off. Even Google scrapped its Project Ara modular smartphone concept.

The phone in the patent is very similar to a traditional device except for the detachable camera module. We don't see any physical buttons or fingerprint sensors. Most of the time patent designs exclude unrelated information and focus on the essential. In other words, the figure is only for illustration purposes.

Yet, we constantly scratch our chins wondering why Democrats fail to get more support from conservative white voters, especially in rural areas. Is it their policy choices? The fact that they nominate too many candidates from the Northeast? Are they not showing sufficient “respect”? Should they offer more praise to country music, pickup trucks and other rural conservative cultural markers? Would that do the trick?

Get ready for a new era of The CW's _Riverdale_ , as the first look at the show's fifth season has officially arrived. On Wednesday, the network debuted a minute-long trailer for the show's upcoming fifth season, which is set to premiere next month after delays tied to the COVID-19 pandemic. As showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa tweeted upon the trailer's debut, the footage only reveals details surrounding the season's first few episodes, which will conclude the high school-set storylines for many of the show's teenage characters, something that was briefly put on pause amid the pandemic. Based on the trailer, that looks like some major milestones like prom and high school graduation -- as well as whatever's going on with the mysterious tapes being delivered across the town.
 "It's funny, we had shot almost two-thirds of episode 20, which was going to be our prom episode. And we looked at that footage and tried to see if there was a way we could cobble together that episode," Aguirre-Sacasa explained back in May. "We actually had shot the prom, where a lot of very dramatic things happen, but we still hadn't shot some big character moments between Archie and Veronica and Betty and Jughead. So we kind of just couldn't do that."
 "However, when I saw the cut of 19, what's great about it is all of the kids are in one big story together united against Mr. Honey. And it does end on a pretty shocking, disturbing cliffhanger," Aguirre-Sacasa continued. "So, it sort of was like, "Oh wait a minute, this could be a great season finale" and then prom would be a great season premiere next year. So it worked out in kind of the best way possible given everything. Obviously we would have loved to have finished the full season, and the last three episodes are fantastic. But to me, this one is fun. It's a special conceit and it brings everyone together, which I think people love."
 Once those storylines commence and _Riverdale_ 's ensemble gets out of high school, the show will be jumping forward at least five years in time, to follow the characters on their post-college trajectories as adults.
 "Season 5 we're actually doing, I believe, a seven-year time jump into the future so we're not going to be teenagers anymore," Lili Reinhart, who plays Betty Cooper on the series, revealed in an interview earlier this year. "I'm really psyched about it. I think it'll be nice to play an adult. But I also really appreciate that Roberto, our showrunner, was like, 'Yeah, let's revamp.' You know, we're not just stuck in high school for seven seasons."

“The other memory was at the end of the final Army-Navy football game. The game was played at the now demolished JFK Stadium that seated over 100,000 fans. After our victory I just stood there taking in the fans, the noise and the smoke from our cannons as it drifted in front of the stadium lights. I wanted to embrace that moment so I could remember it forever. Well, I don’t know about forever, but today, over 50 years later, I remember it as if it happened just this past weekend.”
