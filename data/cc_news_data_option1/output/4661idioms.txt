Ole Miss: The win checked off a few important boxes, including the first win at home and consecutive wins for the first time this season. With three games remaining, Ole Miss is still in the postseason bowl picture with an opportunity to finish .500 or better.

The emotions elicited by these two books from my late mom and my recently college- graduated daughter are best related here in the words of Tom Hanks as Captain Miller in the film, _Saving Private Ryan._ During the final minutes of calm before the storm of the film’s furious final battle, Private Ryan (Matt Damon) graphically and happily tells the intimate and long story of how he spent his last night at home in Iowa with his three now deceased brothers, all of whom he has just learned to have been killed in the war. When he’s finished, he asks Miller to speak from his heart about the Captain’s wife and how she tends her garden and their rose bushes at their home, to which Miller softly replies, “No, no—that one I save just for me.”

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - We’re just over a month away from the start of winter, and those frigid temps can cause big problems for those in the homeless community.Brittney Bowman, who lives in Jackson, knew she wanted to find a way to lend a helping hand."We often complain, complain, complain, but it’s vital if you see a need to address that need,” said Bowman, a community organizer.Assisting people in Jackson’s homeless community is nothing new for Bowman.Five times this year she’s had boots on the ground serving and helping people in need.On Saturday, she saw there was a need to donate warm clothing in light of the cooler temperatures that’ll soon set in.As a result, she teamed up with Association Of South Jackson Neighborhoods, as well as state and local leaders to give away socks, pants, and coats, among other items.“We gave away clothes, shoes, socks, hand sanitizer, masks, food,” said Bowman.“I feel like that’s a good idea to help the homeless,” said Michael Beckley, a Jackson resident. "This is a good blessing from the Lord.”Beckley was one of the people on the receiving end.He admits, he often feels forgotten.That’s why he appreciates this donation, and just knowing someone is thinking and caring about him."That’s a good feeling, the best feeling a person can get sometimes,” said Beckley."People want to feel loved, they want to feel valued, they want to feel someone else cares about them,” said Bowman.Bowman said she’s just thankful to be a blessing to those who need it the most.The Association Of South Jackson Neighborhoods said this is something they plan to continue doing annually."We all can fall on hard times, and we all can stand a little help when those situations happen,” said Ernest Ward, president of Association Of South Jackson Neighborhoods.“They are in this situation today, but it could very easily be us before nightfall,” Bowman expressed. "They are here by so many different circumstances, which we are not all aware of, so we shouldn’t treat them any different than we would out fellow sister, brother, cousin, and or relative, and employee.”Copyright 2020 WLBT.

He gives an erudite and exciting history in the _Annals_ of the days of the earliest post-Augustan rulers, Tiberius and Nero, both of whom descended into violent behavior as a form of political terror. Tacitus is a fabulous, yet strict storyteller and the reader marvels at the intimate details of the many larger than life historical figures that make appearances in the book.

One of her main motivations for setting up her Cake Academy Wales is to help other mothers achieve their dreams and to help others enter a career in the catering sector.
 "I want to give back and help others achieve their goals," she says. At first she opened a shop in Neath but she closed this in March after a disagreement with her landlord. She shows me emails between her and her lawyer about trying to recoup money she says she’s owed.
 It’s not hard to see that her approach to life – typically brash American – is a little out of kilter in a place like Neath, or indeed much of south Wales. But rather than put her off it makes her only more determined, she said.
 This is a woman who has experienced institutionalised racism, been told to "disappear back to where she came from", and threatened and accosted on Neath's streets.
 Wouldn’t it be easier, perhaps, to set up some place else, like Cardiff, or to have stayed put in London, I ask again. "Why should I?" she asks, indignation positively oozing out of every pore.

Augusta, United States, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 15th Nov, 2020 ) :Tiger Woods was going the wrong way on a long day at Augusta National on Saturday, where his bid for a sixth Masters title was on the rocks.
 Woods was four shots off the lead after playing the last eight holes of his second round on Saturday morning, but an even-par third round saw him walk off the course nine off the pace being set by world number one Dustin Johnson.
 Woods, the defending champion, said at the conclusion of his second round that he expected Augusta to yield some low scores in the afternoon.
 "The golf course is definitely gettable," Woods said.
 But Woods couldn't take advantage, making bogeys at the eighth and 11th before his only birdies of the round, at 12 and 15 on the way to a 54-hole total of five-under par 211.
 "It got a little bit faster," Woods said of the course drying out after Thursday's rain. "But the putts just still aren't quite breaking." Woods said the long days resulting from a three-hour weather delay on Thursday were hard on his surgically fused back.
 "It's just part of the deal," said Woods, who looked stiff as he bent to retrieve his ball as the round went on.

Not long afterward, Brown nailed a 24-yard field goal making it a 17-13 lead for the Jaguars at the half.
 “At the end it became the reason we won. It wasn’t the main reason, but it was a big help,” said Brown.
 During the Jaguars first possession of the second half, another fumble gave the ball back to the Cougars.
 And Newton County took advantage, scoring another rushing touchdown before adding a successful two-point conversion to jump back ahead, 21-17.
 Just like a heavyweight bout, North Pike answered back with a blow of its own. A scoring pass from McDowell to Zamarea Fountain gave the Jaguars the lead once again at 24-21.
 Following the score, Newton County displayed its strong running game once again and it showed on the scoreboard following a short touchdown run.
 The Jaguars trailed 28-24 entering the fourth quarter. And it was at this time more than ever in the contest when they called upon the fans to help provide a spark.
 “Our fans, the band, everybody who comes to support, we feed off of their energy and when they get loud for us, we start to get the momentum and make big plays as a team,” said senior Damuriyon Montgomery. “I just thank everybody who came and supported us.”
 Montogomary and the Jaguars fed off of the energy and found success moving the ball down the field. The senior back gave North Pike the lead at 31-28 following a 3-yard touchdown run.
 Then it was the defense's turn to secure the win and it did just that after Tavorius Quin recovered a fumble at the 5:30 mark. From there the Jaguars ran out the clock before walking away with the win.
 “We fought to the very end… honestly it was just a hard fight,” said Mock. "That’s a good team over there and they played their hearts out and I respect them. We talk about it all the time, about taking it one game at a time, but anytime you play the number one team in 4A and their 10-0… we’re the underdogs.”

Because Trump’s narcissism was so profound, he responded to criticism with the political equivalent of a nuclear counterstrike. And because Trump’s insecurity was infectious, his fan base — which had outsize power in primaries — would follow suit. This ensured that most Republican politicians shouted their praise of Trump and muzzled their criticism.
 The same dynamic applied to most right-of-center media and many conservative institutions. Kellyanne Conway may have been joking in 2017 when she said CPAC (the Conservative Political Action Conference) was now TPAC, but it didn’t take long for her observation to seem prophetic.

myself on this meme, living in a striver working-class-to-small-biz owner immigrant Bronx nabe, what I can't get over as a powerful negative is the bad p.r. from the protests in the summer where woke type mixed crowds of college kids either went after people eating in restaurants or went marching through residential neighborhoods yelling that supposed "gentrifiers" don't belong there and give it back to the poor. While it was a small percentage of protests, these videos got tons of play and buzz on social media, I am sure including on Facebook. It's class warfare brassy and bold. The immigrant and 2nd generation of those immigrants aspire to being exactly those gentriifiers. It's like slapping their "American dream" in the face. I'm not making it up, it's a major meme in TV shows like _Shameless_. Or _The Simpsons._ Or heck go all the way t _o The Jefferson's_ and "moving on up." Script writers get that from somewhere, it's not fantasy, it's real. That's really the core of the negative association with the word "socialism". Nearly everyone who chooses to come here does so because they want to get into some of that capitalism via small business and real estate. Ain't for nothing that "prosperity gospel" evangelical storefront churches are popular with lots of urban immigrants. (And of course, a left wing Afro-American "socialist" argument to that has long been that their ancestors didn't choose to come here. Is at the core of some disagreement between immigrants from Africa and Afro-Americans.)

Control of the Senate remains up in the air, and the outcome could have a profound effect on whatever shape another stimulus bill takes. As of this week, the Democrats appear to have 48 seats and the Republicans 50. Georgia's two seats have yet to be filled, given a unique rule in that state requiring candidates to win a majority of the votes. No candidate in either race reached that threshold, sending each election to a runoff in early January. If Republicans win either race, the Senate will remain under their control. If Democrats win both races, the Senate will revert to their control, given that the Vice President casts the deciding vote in a tie.

AUGUSTA -- Comfortable at Augusta National Golf Club since his first visit, Justin Thomas has felt he possessed the course knowledge and game plan to contend for a Masters title.
   
 Poor execution in his first four appearances -- particularly on the greens -- denied the No. 3 player in the world the success he's enjoyed elsewhere in professional golf.
   
 Everyone knew he had the skills to succeed here, too. Through two rounds in the 2020 Masters Tournament, his ball striking and putting have matched his insight. Thomas birdied his final two holes in the second round Friday to reach 9-under for the tournament and earn a share of the overnight lead.
   
 He enters the weekend looking for much more than his first top-10 finish at Augusta National.
   
 "It's definitely not as low as I feel like I could or should be, but we're in good position going into the weekend," he said.
   
 Thomas wasn't pleased with how his first-round 66 ended, either. He missed a downhill 9-foot birdie putt on the 18th green around 9:45 a.m. and squandered other good chances in the closing holes. He ate a quick snack and spent the rest of the 30-minute break with putting coach John Graham, who he started seeing in September.
   
 "A little something was off and I was just trying to figure out what it was," Thomas said. "I had an idea, but I just wanted confirmation from him. We just kind of did that and stuck to what we were doing and I got back out there."
   
 He also knew the receptive greens would yield scoring opportunities if he remained patient.
   
 "You can make so many birdies out here if you have control of your golf ball," Thomas said. "You're driving it well. You have a fair amount of short irons into the greens. And the greens are so good, if you get it in the right spots, you can make it from everywhere."
   
 One of the best iron players in golf, Thomas has hit 80.56% of the greens in regulation (10th in the field) and ranks seventh in proximity to the hole through 36 holes.
   
 Shots of his day
   
 The stellar approach shots have helped him generate 13 birdies, and two in particular were critical to his momentum in the second round.
   
 Thomas was 2 over on his first five holes after a poor wedge forced him to settle for par at 14. From the fairway on the No. 15, he used a 5-wood from 232 yards out to set up an easy two-putt birdie on the par 5. Thomas put the club in his bag five years ago specifically for Augusta National, which in most years demands high, soft approach shots to hold the firm greens.
   
 "15 was a really, really good shot," Thomas said. "I was in between clubs. I knew if I roasted a 4-iron I could get there, but that wasn't the appropriate play."
   
 It was the first of four birdies to close the side and gave Thomas a share of the lead at 8 under making the turn.
   
 He squandered the momentum with a sloppy double-bogey 6 on No. 1, yelling out in frustration and shaking his head as he stood on the back of the green. An errant drive on No. 2 found the fairway bunker but, after laying up, he rebounded again, hitting a wedge approach to 6 feet that set up another birdie and kept him within reach of the lead.
   
 Thomas made his first trip to Augusta National in February 2012, when he was a member of the University of Alabama golf team as the guest of a teammate's father. He made six birdies that day and also developed a healthy respect for the course.
   
 At times in past Masters, he gave too much respect to the trouble spots to avoid at Augusta National and it hindered his scoring. His best finish is a tie for 12th last year.
   
 "I kind of go back to that round, like, dude, remember you made six birdies (at Augusta National) when you were a freshman in college," he said. "I would hope you'd be able to handle it in your fifth appearance now."
   
 So far, he has.

İzmir'i vuran 6.6 büyüklüğündeki deprem kentte büyük çapta hasara yol açtı. İzmir’de depremzedeler için yapılacak olan 3 bin konutluk projede, sosyal ve kültürel tesislerin yanı sıra okul, cami ve bir de millet bahçesi yer alıyor İzmir'i vuran 6.6 büyüklüğündeki deprem kentte büyük çapta hasara yol açtı. Çevre ve Şehircilik Bakanlığının kentte yaptığı hasar tespit çalışmalarında 506 apartman hakkında ağır hasarlı olduğu için yıkım kararı verildi. Evsiz kalan 15 bin kişi kentin çeşitli yerlerinde kurulan çadır kentlere yerleştirildi. Deprem sonrasında evleri yıkılan ve ağır hasar gören vatandaşların çeşitli kurumlar tarafından geçici süreyle ihtiyaçları giderilirken rezerv konut alanına yönelik çalışmalarda da önemli mesafe kat edildi. TASLAK PLAN BELLİ OLDU Çevre ve Şehircilik Bakanı Murat Kurum, evleri yıkılan vatandaşların bulundukları yerden talep etmeleri halinde 2+1, rezerv konut alanından talep etmeleri halinde 3+1 daire sahibi olabileceklerini açıklamıştı. Maliyetine, düşük faizli ve uzun yıllar ödemeli yeni konutların taslak planı da ortaya çıktı. Bayraklı Şehir Hastanesi'nin yanından başlayan ve tünellerin üzerinden itibaren geniş alana yayılan 3 bin konutluk alanda eğitim alanı olarak anaokulu, ilkokul, orta okul ve lise bulunuyor. Sosyal tesis alanı ve kültürel tesis alanının bulunduğu alanda iki adet cami yerinin de ayrıldığı görüldü. Konut alanı tünellerin üzerine doğru bir hilal şeklini alırken Bayraklı Doğançay Köyü bölgesine doğru arka alanda da geniş konut stok alanı yer alıyor. MİLLET BAHÇESİ Bakanlık, rezerv konut alanının yapılacağı bölgede geniş bir millet bahçesi alanı da planladı. Vaziyet planında bu alanın mevcut yerleşim yerlerine yakın bölgede olması dikkat çekiyor. Daha önce Bayraklı Belediyesi'nin kurban yeri olarak kullandığı, Büyükşehir Belediyesi'nin ise Ord. Prof. Dr. Ekrem Akurgal Kapalı Spor Salonu ile Yaşam Parkı yaptığı alanın yakınında yer alan millet bahçesinin planlandığı alanda şu anda bir yapı bulunmuyor. Bakan Kurum, 'İlk etapta 3 bin konut planlıyoruz, zemin artı 4 katı, 5 katı geçmeyecek şekliyle bir projelendirme yaptık. Hızlı bir şekilde depremde hasar gören vatandaşlarımızın sıcak yuvalarının inşasını gerçekleştirip bir yıl içerisinde sağlam konutlarımızı inşallah vatandaşlarımıza teslim ediyor olacağız' demişti. GEÇİCİ BARINMA MERKEZİNE İLK KONTEYNERLER GELDİ İzmir'de meydana gelen depremin ardından evleri zarar gören vatandaşlar için yapılacak geçici barınma merkezine ilk konteynerler yerleştirilmeye başlandı. Depremde yıkılan veya yıkılma tehlikesine karşı kontrollü yıkımı gerçekleştirilen binalarda yaşayanların kullanımına yönelik AFAD tarafından bin konteynerden oluşan geçici barınma merkezinin hafriyat çalışmaları tamamlandı. Haydar Aliyev Caddesi'nde kurulacak geçici barınma merkezine ilk konteynerler geldi. Bin konteyner ve sosyal donatı alanları kısa sürede hizmete sunulacak.

LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) — In 1950, Harry Truman was president, Earl Long was governor of Louisiana and Hilma Levis was Hilma LaBauve, a 19-year- old sophomore at Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute in her hometown of Lafayette. She was majoring in elementary education at SLI, and outside of class, she wrote for The Vermilion and cheered on the Bulldogs as one of the Red Jackets. The pep squad was known for their formations on the field, their white pleated skirts and gloves, and their red jackets, of course. Seventy years later, Levis, 89, returned to her hometown and alma mater, wearing a red jacket and reminiscing with old friends about how they would get demerits if their saddle shoes weren’t clean. “It was a lot of camaraderie,” said Betty Lowry of Lafayette. “We all cheered and marched together.” Lowry, 87, was on the squad from 1950 to 1953. “It gave me a group to be a part of,” Lowry said. The squad lasted only through 1957, to be replaced over time by other groups like the Sweethearts and the Ragin’ Jazz, but that hasn’t stopped them. The Red Jackets are still at it. Members return to campus every year for homecoming, calling themselves the Agin’ Ragin’ Cajuns, to hold a meeting, share a meal and watch the football game together. “It’s our little community,” said Corinne Randazzo, 88, from Vidalia.

Chatham's elections officials launched the county's by-hand ballot recount on Friday, mobilizing some 50 workers on short notice to begin the meticulous vote-verification process within a buzzing Savannah warehouse.
   
 Following Wednesday's order by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to conduct a hand recount of all general-election presidential votes cast statewide by Nov. 18, the Chatham County Board of Elections hopped into action to round up enough qualified workers required for carrying out this Herculean feat of democracy.
            
 According to Chatham's initial Nov. 3 election results, 78,369 county residents voted for Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, while Republican President Donald Trump garnered 53,288 votes.
   
 On Friday afternoon, Chatham County Elections Assistant Supervisor Lynn Trabue was overseeing the temporary Board of Election annex set up within Building C at 10 Mall Terrace in Savannah. She said that approximately 50 workers were beginning the recount process on Friday, with another 35 expected to be hired to work daily through the weekend and onwards to the Wednesday deadline.
   
 "I'm so grateful everybody came today," Trabue said, noting that the Board of Elections is also keeping a list of backup workers to join the effort as needed.
   
 "You never know what may come up with so many people getting sick."
   
 On Thursday, Chatham Elections Supervisor Russell Bridges said that the department was only hiring the county's experienced poll workers and absentee- ballot counters for this effort because anyone involved in the hand recount must have passed a background check, and there is not enough time to conduct new employee screenings at this point.
   
 Bridges added that he believes 70 workers will be able to successfully complete the recount on time by working eight-hour shifts daily until Wednesday, but that these arrangements could be changed later depending on the rate of progress made. He said that the total cost of this effort to Chatham taxpayers is projected at $60,000.
   
 Within the converted warehouse that was also used for counting absentee ballots immediately after the Nov. 3 election, pairs of election workers sat at long tables on Friday afternoon as they began the process of verifying votes one at a time. Piles of paperwork and office supplies were divided between tables as additional boxes of ballot materials were continually unloaded nearby. Participants wore face masks and were seated with social distancing.
   
 The ballot-counting center also features a spectator area divided by plywood- and-plexiglass walls, where the press and public can observe the entire process. Additionally, volunteers from Chatham's Democrat and Republican parties were on hand Friday as registered volunteer poll watchers.
   
 Chatham County Democratic Committee Chairman James "Jay" Jones stood within the observation area on Friday afternoon, speaking with his party's poll watchers. After arranging five Democrats to keep tabs on the recount Friday, he said that more volunteers would be arranged for each of the following days.
   
 "I think the recount is ridiculous," Jones said, adding that the entire endeavor was organized by Republicans "fishing to try to find ballots that don't exist."
   
 Nonetheless, Jones said that Chatham's Democrats would make sure to do their part in this process in coordination with the Democratic National Committee.
   
 "Of course, the DNC is based up north, so they're leaning heavily on the CCDC," Jones said. "Each day we'll bring in more people."
   
 Standing a few steps away, Chatham County Republican Party Chairman Don Hodges was speaking with his gathered poll watchers, urging them to stay vigilant throughout the recount.
   
 "You've got one observer for seven tables, so it's almost impossible to see everything," Hodges said, adding that he'd arranged for six poll watchers to keep an eye out on Friday, while more would be coming during the upcoming days. "They're volunteers. You've got attorneys that are donating their time."
   
 Asked if he expected the hand-recount results to differ considerably from the original vote outcome, Hodges said that this was certainly plausible.
   
 "It possibly could. We've discovered that you have to vote to die in Georgia," Hodges said. "Any of this stuff could be hacked. … It only takes one nefarious person to put something in a computer to change every dynamic of an election."
   
 Late Friday afternoon, the Chatham Board of Elections met via Zoom to certify the county's initial Nov. 3 results. During the brief meeting, Bridges noted that if the hand recount produces any variation in vote totals -- which he expects would only be a minor change -- the board will need to later certify the updated results.

 “We want to stand with the president until a decision is made,” said Williams.
 “So if Biden is really the president, I will accept that and I don't believe it’s on the up and up right now. And that's what I want to see before I end my support,” said Arrington.

Berlin, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 15th Nov, 2020 ) :Chelsea striker Timo Werner scored twice on his return to Leipzig Saturday as Germany went top of their Nations League group with a convincing 3-1 win over Ukraine.
 Having joined the Premier League side last July after four years with RB Leipzig, Werner played a starring role behind closed doors at the Red Bull Arena.
 "I had four good years here and it was fun to come back here and win," Werner told ZDF.
 "We had a few players missing," he added with Toni Kroos suspended and Joshua Kimmich sidelined by a knee injury, "which made it hard to find our ryhthm".
 "But we have enough time to improve before the Euros" he added in reference to Germany's opening Euro 2020 match against world champions France in Munich in seven months' time.
 The win leaves Germany undefeated in their last 12 games and top of their Nations League group, a point ahead of second-placed Spain with the sides due to meet in Sevilla on Tuesday.
 "We had plenty of tempo in the first-half, controlled the game after the break, even if we gave away too much possession at times," said Germany head coach Joachim Loew.
 "All in all, we have to be happy with the win." Ukraine took an early lead when Roman Yaremchuk caught the German defence napping.
 The hosts roared back with three unanswered goals by Leroy Sane and Werner, who scored either side of half-time, to seal a deserved win.
 The game was only confirmed hours before kick-off after five of the Ukraine squad were quarantined after testing positive for Covid-19 on Friday.
 However, further tests on Saturday revealed no new cases of the coronavirus.

 Pine-Richland (9-0) moves on to play Governer Mifflin in the PIAA semifinals. Peters Township finishes the season with an 8-1 record.
 The Rams have won WPIAL titles five times: 2003, 2014, 2017, 2018 and 2020.
 "We ran into a team that made a few more plays," said Donovan McMillan, headed to Florida soon to extend his athletic and scholastic ventures. "I think we had a wonderful season. These guys are like brothers to me. It's going to hard to leave them."
 This was the second time Peters Township has made the finals, losing both.
 "It wasn't our night," said Peters Township head coach TJ Plack. "They have talented guys at every position. They won the war up front and that really hurt. Hats off to (Pine-Richland). They have a very good team."
 Pine-Richland quarterback Cole Spencer, headed to Penn to wrestle, had a terrific game, passing for 131 yards on 15 completions in 31 attempts. He also ran the ball 14 times for 103 yards.
 "We got off to a good start, except for the first drive," said Spencer. "But I think we scored on every other possession of the first half. We have a state championhip team here. That's the goal."
 Eli Jochem had eight receptions for 72 yards, running back Brooks Eastburn rushed five times for 102 yards and Caden Sweiger had 58 yards on 18 attempts.

WASHINGTON -- Republicans are flooding Georgia with cash and field operatives as they look to keep Democrats from seizing control of the Senate under President-elect Joe Biden's administration.
   
 The Republican National Committee said Friday it is funding more than 600 staffers in the state with an investment of at least $20 million ahead of the Jan. 5 runoffs for the seats held by GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Democrats are eying victories for Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the respective races to create a 50-50 tie in the chamber, which would be decided by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
   
 The GOP's investment follows on the party's massive ground game and data operation in the 2020 presidential race, which fought a large Democratic operation. The party said it organized more than 2.6 million volunteers and had more than 3,000 paid field staffers across key battleground states. In Georgia alone, the RNC says it knocked on more than 3 million doors, made more than 8 million phone calls and registered at least 16,000 voters in the leadup to the presidential election.
   
 "Georgians are counting on Republicans to hold the line against the Democrats' desire to raise taxes, pack the Supreme Court and give government control over their health care," RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel said. "We need Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the Senate, and the RNC is mobilizing our grassroots army to help keep them there."
   
 Both candidates fell short of the 50% threshold to win the seats, and under state law the top two finishers will face off head to head. The twin runoffs are expected to approach or even exceed records spent on Senate races, as the prospect of unified Democratic control of Washington hangs in the balance.
   
 The Associated Press has not called the presidential race in the state, which is heading to a recount with Biden holding a narrow lead over President Donald Trump. The RNC had already sent about 100 staffers to help with fixing small errors or omissions on voters' ballots, called "curing," and assist with the recount.

The period between an incumbent's defeat and the new president's inauguration is always awkward. At the end of this lame duck-ship, the outgoing president traditionally welcomes the new first family to the White House for a social visit and then accompanies the new president to the inauguration ceremony. This can hardly be enjoyable for anyone who just lost an election, and for Donald Trump it might be intolerable.
   
 To avoid all this unpleasantness, President Trump should retire immediately and let Mike Pence concede the election, occupy the White House, and handle the transition.
   
 COVID-19 remains a terrible problem. Pence has generally been credited with doing a decent job -- within limits imposed by Trump -- of chairing efforts to cope with this problem. He could continue doing so as president. He and his wife, Karen, could host the Bidens cordially on inauguration day and participate gracefully when Joe Biden is sworn in.
   
 A few months in the White House could give Pence a head start on securing the Republican nomination in 2024. Giving him this opportunity would be a gracious reward for his undivided loyalty to Trump during the last three and a half years.
   
 As a former member of Congress, Pence has frequently negotiated with members of both parties. He probably found himself grinding his teeth, given Trump's frequent changes of mind about legislation. But he would be in a good position to work effectively with congressional Republicans and Democrats during the transition period.
   
 Pence's political enemies might claim that he is damaged goods because of his close association with Trump. Trump's personal life was certainly not what Pence -- as a born-again Christian -- could have admired. As Benjamin Franklin supposedly said, "If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas." But this argument assumes the worst about Pence's motives for agreeing to run with Trump in 2016.
   
 Pence as an undergraduate supposedly told fellow students at Hanover College that God intended to make him president. So he may simply have let his political ambition override all questions of propriety or prudence. But it is also possible that he felt that his advice, based on long political experience, might help Trump avoid doing something dangerous.
   
 Whether you see Pence as an unscrupulous opportunist or as a sincere idealist doing an unpleasant but necessary job, there can be no doubt that he is well- prepared to fill in as president.
   
 Pence's ability to work with both parties could pave the way for the bipartisanship promised by president-elect Joe Biden. Biden, probably facing a Republican-controlled Senate, will need to work closely with leaders of both parties, and Pence could get this process going during his occupancy of the White House. If he is successful at this, Biden might find it useful to find a place for Pence as well as other Republicans in his own administration.
   
 Of course Pence has his critics. Conservative columnist George Will once described him as "America's most repulsive figure." Michael D'Antonio and Peter Eisner noted that "The vice president reached the nadir of his toady ways … when he spent three minutes extolling Trump at a Cabinet meeting and managed to work in one note of praise every 12 seconds."
   
 But as D'Antonio and Eisner concluded, he "believes God has a plan for him, and if that plan requires him to abandon his principles as well as his dignity, so be it."
   
 Perhaps Pence overdid in praising Donald Trump, but we can't evaluate him with any certainty until we see him in action as his own man. For the good of the country, his own state of mind, the Republican Party, and a smooth administrative transition, Trump should give Pence this chance.

HOMEDALE — Third time is the charm. At least that’s what the Homedale football team is hoping.
 The Trojans clinched their third straight trip to the 3A state championship game on Saturday, beating South Fremont 48-28 in the semifinals.
 Now Homedale (8-1) will try and do something not done in 23 years. The Trojans will be eyeing their first state title since 1997 next weekend when they face off against Sugar-Salem, the same team that has beaten Homedale in the championship game in each of the last two years.

This also works the other way: When you think of Aspen, Colorado, the mountains of Vermont, or even international alpine destinations such as resorts in the Canadian Rockies, you probably think of snow, skiing, and sky- high prices. Well, during the summer months, many areas famous for their winter sports are significantly cheaper. You can often book a room in a ski town for half the cost of winter rates during the warmer months, and provided you like hiking, biking, and spending time in nature, your recreational activities can be all but free. There are no lift tickets when you're walking up a mountain, and if you're cool with a picnic lunch, you can bring all the food and other gear you'll need right on your back. As another bonus, ski resorts that are open for summer hiking mean all the pleasure of a nature excursion with all the convenience of bathrooms, restaurants, and shops close at hand.

Yes, absolutely. So that is a question for all therapies that people have grappled with. What is enough? And basically, what I think most people including us have landed is it has to be going down in the right direction and it has to be beyond just significant, so very significant. So it's not just [indiscernible] observation. But to Sheila's point, I think that other folks and us including have really zeroed in here. Do we have then proteomics biomarkers that go with it? You see some significant change in cytokines, in chemokines, which we do, and that is really that you want in fact in the biology. And then as Sheila mentioned, at the end of the day the tumor is all about the T cells, specifically the CD8. And are you seeing an increase in CD8 into much infiltration? And we are.

For example, in conversation with a friend the other day, I observed how I’ve become less readily able to connect with some basic human matters of the heart and the soul. (During the 80s and 90s, my ability to be open-hearted, and to enter into such humane conversation in a deep way, had been growing. But now it’s as though I must first peel a scale off my heart.)
 Back in 2004, I had to drag myself kicking and screaming (figuratively speaking) to answer that call of duty.
 At that point in 2004, I had been on a path that was feeding my soul. Out of a powerful spiritual experience, my soul had been lit on fire to write a book called “Mapping the Sacred.” Having spent my whole adult life dealing with the darkness of humankind — e.g. the threats of nuclear holocaust and environmental destruction — that task felt like a gift. (Now at last I could focus instead on something joyful: exploring “the sacred” in its many dimensions — things like “the good, the true, and the beautiful” — and noting with awe the larger Wholeness to which they all pointed.)

Those are all really good questions that should be explored in the curriculum. Most are not in and of themselves race based. For example the history we choose to teach should address how people challenge power. But it doesn't begin and end with racism or MLK and BLM. The fight for 40 hour work weeks, labor protections, minimum wage, and the union movement is part of the history. It predates FDR and the New Deal. Of course the civil rights movement but also Women's suffrage, NOW and ACT UP. The value in those questions depends on how they are answered. If the answers become nothing but race and racism it's as much a disservice to our history as the faultless greatest nation on earth ultra nationalistic over the top patriotic narrative that came before it.

Burnett: Strelow finding ‘over the top’
 News

Two hundred seventy votes are required for election.
 But Margarita Urtubey, 49, a horse breeder from Miami, said the election was "so corrupt," adding, "Trump won by a landslide. We are here to march for the 'stop the steal' of this election, to make our voice heard." Trump tweeted that "hundreds of thousands" had turned out -- while his spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany made the greatly exaggerated claim that more than a million people were present.
 But the turnout was undoubtedly high for a strongly Democratic city, boosted by protesters from around the country, from Florida to Pennsylvania to Colorado.
 Darion Schaublin, who drove from Columbus, Ohio, said "the whole system's rigged... in the way that the information is getting to the people." "The truth never actually gets out," said the 26-year-old, who says he lost his job in a restaurant after refusing to wear a mask to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
 Kathlin Erickson, who said she flew from Colorado on a plane "filled with Trump supporters," kept alive hopes of a second Trump administration.
 "A Trump victory? That's a long shot, but anything is possible with God," she said.
 Trump is impeding Biden's transition ahead of inauguration on January 20 and has filed numerous lawsuits -- unsuccessfully -- to challenge vote counts around the country.
 He said Friday "time will tell" if he remains president, in a momentary slip of his refusal to concede defeat.
 \- Biden prepares for power - Despite his own intelligence officials' declaration this week that the election was "the most secure in American history," Trump and his right-wing media allies show no sign of giving up their quest to get the results overturned.
 After driving past the marchers in Washington, Trump headed to his golf club outside the capital as he kept to his regular weekend routine.
 Half a dozen supporters stood at one side of the entrance with Trump flags, and about the same number stood on the opposite side with a big "Biden Harris" sign and one that said: "We voted. You're fired."Biden on Saturday went biking in a Delaware state park with his wife Jill and a security detail. When asked if he was closer to choosing his cabinet, he replied "yes."

Geneva, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 15th Nov, 2020 ) :After years of US disengagement and confrontation, international organisations in Geneva appeared to breathe a collective sigh of relief at Joe Biden's presidential election win -- but the anticipated honeymoon could be short.
 "I think everyone is basically waiting with open arms for the US government to come back," said Manfred Elsig, an international relations professor at the World Trade Institute of Bern University.
 Republican President Donald Trump's administration has been a traumatic experience for international organisations that in many cases were created by the United States and accustomed to strong US support and leadership.
 In Geneva alone, the United States has, under Trump, cut its ties to the UN's top rights body, hamstrung the World Trade Organization and begun withdrawing from the World Health Organization even as the body strives to coordinate the global response to Covid-19.
 After the election was called for Democratic Party candidate Biden last weekend, "there was a huge sigh of relief" within the international organisations, a Geneva trade official told AFP, asking not to be named.
 Observers expect Washington under Biden to re-engage with the international community and its institutions, and to resume discussions on a number of issues blocked by his predecessor.
 \- Celebration time - "I think there will be a bit of a honeymoon," Elsig said, warning though that the blissful period could be "short".
 The narrative pushed hard for four years that international organisations are taking advantage of the US remains deeply engrained, especially among Republicans, he said.
 "Every step that the Biden administration will take towards engaging with the world and international organisations will be critically monitored in the United States." While plenty of stumbling blocks remain, there is optimism in Geneva that discussions within international forums will become more constructive.
 The WHO has particular reason to celebrate, after suffering relentless US attacks in recent months.
 Accusing the United Nations health agency of mishandling the Covid-19 response and of kowtowing to China, Trump has begun withdrawing the United States \-- traditionally the WHO's top donor -- from the organisation.

FAYETTEVILLE -- Two of the SEC's hottest quarterbacks sizzle tonight in the same place they quarterbacked the same team.
   
 At the Florida Gators' "Swamp," former Florida quarterback Feleipe Franks quarterbacks the revived Razorbacks against the Gators' Kyle Trask, Franks' former backup become Heisman Trophy candidate.
   
 Franks, 6-6, 238, has become a huge Arkansas story. He's the 2020 graduate transfer quarterbacking first-year Coach Sam Pittman's Razorbacks to a 3-3 SEC start that for an egregious officiating error in the 30-28 loss at Auburn would be 4-2.
   
 Quite the contrast to the Hogs wallowed 1-7, 0-8, 0-8 in the SEC the previous three years.
   
 Trask sets SEC records while quarterbacking the 4-1 nationally No. 6 Gators going into tonight's 6 p.m. televised by ESPN.
   
 Both arrived in Gainesville as redshirting freshmen in 2016.
   
 Trask was injured all of 2017. Franks, with a Hail Mary pass victory over Tennessee, started the most games in a 4-7 season of quarterback roulette.
   
 Coach Jim McElwain was fired, and former Arkansas assistant Randy Shannon finished 2017 as interim head coach.
   
 Franks started every 2018 game starring for then new Florida Coach Dan Mullen. Florida went 10-3 and thumped Michigan in the Peach Bowl
   
 Trask played well off the bench once when Franks struggled. Then Trask broke his foot missing 2018's remainder.
   
 In 2019 Franks started the first three games. He and the Gators struggled trailing Kentucky Game Three when Franks broke his ankle. It ended Franks' season.
   
 Trask overcame Kentucky and so fueled the 11-3 Gators that Franks knew he needed somewhere anew to be a starting 2020 senior.
   
 Tonight after four years of competing and commiserating, the friends rival on game night.
   
 "Yeah, we did get along pretty well," Franks said. "He drove me to get better. I hopefully drove him to get better, and he's playing really well as well as their team. We have a really good relationship but at the end of the day one person is going to win and one is going to lose."
   
 That there seems even a remote possibility acknowledged that 17-point underdog Arkansas could win speaks glowingly of Franks.
   
 Count Mullen among the chorus.
   
 "I knew he would be successful wherever they went," Mullen said.
   
 Franks and Mullen parted more than amicably. Each did so much for the other. Mullen knew the disservice relegating Franks second team if the senior wished finishing starting elsewhere.
   
 "A lot of our discussion was make sure you find the best situation for you," Mullen said. "I'm really happy for him and it doesn't surprise me."
   
 Franks' talent and leadership and winning experience would enhance any team, Mullen said.
   
 Same for Pittman, Mullen said of the nationally respected offensive line coach including 2013-2015 at Arkansas, now head coaching after 2016-2019 coaching the O-line for Kirby Smart's four consecutive SEC East Georgia champions including a national runner-up.
   
 "They have a new coach and a new quarterback into a program that hasn't won," Mullen said. "But both those two came from winning programs. Just follow what we are doing. We know how to win. Obviously they (the Razorbacks) have talent both sides of the ball. What changed is the mindset. I know Feleipe was probably a major part."
   
 Franks was and is, Pittman says.
   
 "We count on Feleipe," Pittman said. "He's our guy. He's our leader. He's our bell-cow or however you want to say it."
   
 Intangible leader bringing tangible results.
   
 Franks has completed 123 of 184 for 1,428 yards with 14 touchdowns vs. three interceptions. Since the 37-10 season-opening loss to Georgia and with two interceptions, Franks TD/interception ratio is 13-1, 6-0 the last two games, plus big plays running including a 28-yarder.
   
 "I'd be lying if I said I haven't paid attention to it," Franks said of recent stats. "But it's not something that's my main focus. My main focus is just spreading the ball around to the guys, and they make plays for me. I'd be selfish if I took any credit for that."
   
 Trask truly astounds. His completion ratio, 125 for 182, nearly mirrors Franks, but wow the 1,815 yards passing in one less game and the 22 TDs vs. three interceptions….
   
 "Kyle Trask plays lights out," Pittman said. "Lot of confidence and a lot of help. The guy can throw any ball, but he has some outstanding skill players. He's getting good protection and the guys are getting open and he's getting rid of the ball because he knows where he wants to go."
   
 Mullen in short described Trask's long success.
   
 "He's not going to force the ball," Mullen said. "If they're going bracket and take away and double people, he's going to go to who you're not doubling or covering."
   
 Mullen chose the right one for Florida.
   
 Turns out he helped choose the right one for Arkansas, too.

 To be successful, Van Dusen says, take responsibility for your people and never sue your biggest customer. As for TV ads, remember that they’re trend- driven, and that the best parts are often rejected in editing. When in business, don’t assume anything, keep your family close, and never stand behind a female lion.
 Oh, my, but there’s a lot of swagger inside “60 Stories about 30 Seconds.” It shouts from nearly every page and sometimes, it’s rather offputting. The one thing that’s worse are the short sentences. Short. Constantly short. Half- thoughts. Hard to read. Not easy.
 If you can look past the fact that most of the 60 (plus) stories aren’t about TV commercials, and you don’t mind that the ones that are TV-related can tend to be dated, you’ll eventually find author Bruce Van Dusen’s biography, which is interesting and varied but also somewhat dated. Van Dusen won awards for his work, and he made films with some of Hollywood’s best ... 30 or 40 years ago. Ad-making technology has overwhelmingly advanced since then; still, many of those short vignettes are enjoyable enough to seek out.
 As for business readers, there are nuggets here, and still-relevant advice on TV ads, but you’ll have to search for both while you’re reading “60 Stories about 30 Seconds.” If you haven’t the patience for that, though, then just zap past it.

Thread provides many substantial benefits over existing connectivity options, and now that Apple has added it to HomePod mini, it is poised to be a game-changer for the HomeKit platform. Here's why. The new Nanoleaf Essentials Bulb that supports Thread Why Thread? Thread is a new IP- based smart home connectivity standard, akin to Zigbee or Z-wave. Thread- enabled devices create a mesh network that interconnects all of the different devices together. With a mesh network, they can all connect and expand their reach far further than any single device could connect on its own. Thread could connect lights, thermostats, smoke detectors, contact sensors, and more, allowing them to communicate throughout your home and extending their range. Unlike Z-Wave and Zigbee (used by Philips Hue lights), Thread devices don't require their own hub to work. They can connect independently as well as too one another. It can also self-heal, so if one device goes out of commission, it will readjust to the next most substantial connection and keep stay up and running. Rather than a single-use hub, these devices can connect online with what's known as a Border Router. This isn't a device itself by itself, but a feature of existing devices you may already have in your home. Some new routers are including Thread support, and of course HomePod mini. Thread will create a mesh network between all Thread-enabled devices in your home, with no user configuration, and be aided by existing devices that can double as a Border Router. It is also very low latency, making it usable for battery- powered accessories. Since it is an open standard, devices from many manufacturers will be compatible. Compared with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi We already talked about how Thread is better than Zigbee and Z-Wave by not requiring a bridge to work and having no singular point of failure. Now, let's compare with what is more common in the HomeKit space. That would be Bluetooth and Wi- Fi. At the moment, nearly all HomeKit devices, except Philips Hue, use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth-- both are very problematic. Wi-Fi is useful because no matter where you have the device in your home, it can (hopefully) connect to your network to be reachable. It also can more easily enable remote access or connectivity to your Home Hub. But it has problems-- it only works on the 2.4GHz channel, almost always is required to be plugged into power, and must be in range of your Wi-Fi to connect. Thread can extend far beyond the range of your Wi-Fi and into low-coverage areas of your home by simply connecting to other Thread devices that are nearby. It can also run on battery or low-power devices like door locks, smoke detectors, light bulbs, contact sensors, and more. Assuming your Home Hub supports Thread to enable remote connectivity, these Thread HomeKit devices will have all the benefits of Wi-Fi without the downsides. Then there is Bluetooth. Bluetooth is fantastic because it is low power and allows the devices to run on battery power rather than a wall socket. Contact sensors, locks, temperature sensors, and more are all common Bluetooth HomeKit devices. These devices run into their own issues. They must be within close Bluetooth range of your Home Hub to be reached when your phone isn't nearby. This can be very limiting, and automations can fail if you don't have a Home Hub within range. Bluetooth also can't extend itself. Latency is a problem with Bluetooth too. The latency isn't bad, but it can be between 80 milliseconds and 800 milliseconds. ZigBee is around 50 milliseconds to 230 milliseconds, and Thread is only 40 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds. Out of all of them, Thread responds the fastest and has better range. Connected by Thread The non-profit group developing Thread has been around since 2016 but Apple didn't join until 2018. While we always assumed Thread would be coming to HomeKit accessories, it has taken some time before any Apple-specific hardware has supported the standard. Apple's first piece of Thread-enabled hardware is the new HomePod mini. Apple's keynote came and went without a mention of Thread for HomePod mini, but it was listed as a line item in its tech specs. Many assumed we'd see something sooner rather than later, and they were right. Nanoleaf has announced its new smart light platform, dubbed Nanoleaf Essentials, which support Thread. Additionally, Eve Systems has started to add Thread to its already existing products, rolling out firmware updates starting with its Door and Window Sensor before expanding to its entire product line. It is incredible that Thread can simply be added through firmware and doesn't necessarily require new hardware. We anticipate that Thread will expand as big names like Apple hop on board. The clear path forward When you picture a future where all of your HomeKit devices pair together to blanket your whole home in a mesh network that has remote access and lightning-fast responsiveness, Thread seems like the logical path forward. All of the current weak points -- lack of Wi-Fi coverage, hubs not close enough, no Wi-Fi on battery-powered devices, slow response times -- would be a thing of the past. Thread is only now starting to make its way into consumer products, and it will likely play a big part in HomeKit and the Project Connect Home over IP group that Apple also joined in late 2019. Apple has been keeping the end-game square in its sights for years, and its vision can finally be realized with Thread. HomeKit is ready to take off, and Thread is what will be tying it all together.

The character that Suriya plays is based on GR Gopinath (aka Captain Gopinath) who gave India its first budget airline, Air Deccan. The film is inspired by Captain Gopinath's book _Simply Fly A Deccan Odyssey_. However, before the movie was made, director Sudha K Prasad had to pursue Captain for a long time before he agreed to give her the rights to make the film. "Sudha had approached me several times but somehow I wasn't too convinced," says the Bengaluru-based entrepreneur. She even got a producer from Andhra to make the film, I had turned her down that time as well. I had written the book keeping the rural youth in mind. I wanted it to be an inspirational story for those youngsters who hesitate to take the plunge and follow their dreams. It is my story, I studied in a local school and I pursued my dreams. So, when I was approached for the rights, I told them the film had to be true to the essence of the book," he explains about why he was so hesitant to give permission.

Mă întreb şi eu dacă nu cumva prezenţa acestui om în fruntea Bisericii Ortodoxe Române în acei ani a fost providenţială. Poate că nu era altul mai potrivit, din toate punctele de vedere, să treacă această Biserică, cu bunele şi relele ei, cu tăria şi cu slăbiciunile ei, prin urgia acelor ani. Nu mă îndoiesc că ceva de dincolo de el l-a dus către această funcţie. La început, a fost un preot vrednic din Oltenia cu o oarecare ascensiune în ierarhia locală, aşa cum erau mulţi alţii în toate zonele ţării. A devenit văduv, a simpatizat sincer cu stânga, l-a ascuns pe Dej fugar înainte de august 1944 şi aşa s-au împrietenit. După august 1944, începe adevărata lui ascensiune. Nu ştiu dacă ştiţi, dar după moartea ciudată a bătrânului patriarh Nicodim, comunistul Emil Bodnăraş avea candidatul lui la scaunul patriarhal, iar Dej, iată, pe al lui. Au fost ceva lupte intestine în partid şi a câştigat, în cele din urmă, propunerea lui Dej: Justinian Marina. Şi gândiţi-vă ce ani a prins ca patriarh! A prins din plin stalinismul în forma originală, vagul dezgheţ hruşciovist, a prins trupele sovietice în România, dar şi plecarea lor, concomitentă cu o anume renaştere a naţionalismului în politica statului comunist, falsa liberalizare din primii ani ai lui Ceauşescu şi închiderea de după 1971 – vremuri foarte complicate, care i-au derutat pe mulţi dintre cei care le-au trăit, inclusiv oameni inteligenţi şi curaţi sufleteşte. I se reproşează patriarhului Justinian că n-a fost un erou. Când am înţeles ce-i eroismul, mi-am dat seama că e o ticăloşie să îi reproşezi cuiva că, într-o situaţie tragică, nu se comportă ca un erou. Eu nu pot să-i reproşez niciunui om care a trăit în comunism că nu s-a comportat eroic şi tocmai de aceea îi venerez, pur şi simplu, pe eroii anticomunişti. Câţi au fost. Trist de puţini.

Devillier said the problem was not so much the number of positive cases but the number of kids who had to be quarantined as a result.
 Devillier said offering daily in-person instruction for 1,000 teenagers makes social distancing very difficult. Seats are spaced a few feet apart, but not the six feet that is recommended by health authorities.
 Standing in one classroom, Devillier tried to illustrate how quarantines can add up quickly. He did so by pointing one by one to a cluster of five empty desks.
 “If you got a kid sitting in that seat,” Devillier said, pointing at one desk, “and they come up positive, then that kid, that kid, that kid, and possibly this kid have to come and quarantine. That (positive) kid might go to seven different classes, so you might quarantine 30 different kids because of one.”
 He said a few cases can mean that 150 or more students have to quarantine. And that’s not counting quarantines that occur because students are exposed by positive family members and consequently can’t return to school for 14 days.
 With so many children quarantined, it became hard to have in-person instruction. That persuaded Devillier that it was time to make the high school virtual-only. The decision does not affect Zachary’s six other schools.

BOISE – Idaho Gov. Brad Little held a press conference Friday regarding the current state of COVID-19 across the state, starting with an emergency declaration to activate the Idaho National Guard to aid in the current COVID crisis across the state, rolling the Reopen Idaho plan back to a modified stage two, and pleading with residents to take the initiative to wear a mask.
 Little started with the activation of the National Guard, inviting Commanding Gen. Michael Garshak to explain the different areas that the Guardsmen will be aiding. Gen. Garshak said they will provide supportive services to medical professionals in areas such as contract tracing, cleaning and disinfecting, mobile testing units, and other areas. The Guard units will activate with local doctors who are in the National Guard being left in their position working in their healthcare field. The National Guard will facilitate anything they can to help in slowing the continued spread of the virus.
 Little said he will be moving the state back to stage two of the Reopen Idaho plan because of the current infection levels, intensive care unit burdens, and the responses from hospital administrations stating that they are just weeks away from being on full triage level of care. St. Luke’s Hospital in Boise has already started its plans for the continued influx of COVID patients and flu patients by canceling elective surgeries until after Christmas. The rollback into stage two limits social gatherings to 10 people inside or outside — that does not include schools or churches — and allows businesses to remain open with the only limits being that restaurants and bars should allow seating room only.

One of the bright spots of the reaction to the pandemic is that “consumers have learned how to cook at home again,” he added. “We see that trend continuing.”
 Demand has remained strong at the retail level and the foodservice industry is bouncing back quicker than people had anticipated, Muir said.
 “We are seeing a recovery,” he said.
 Fortunately, despite the coronavirus-related restrictions and other challenges posed by the pandemic, “demand (for potatoes) is still very strong,” said Potatoes USA President and CEO Blair Richardson.
 He said there has been a 15 percent increase so far this year in retail sales of potatoes and spuds account for 22.4 percent of all vegetables sold at grocery stores this year, ranking them No. 1 in that category.
 The pandemic forced more people to cook food in their own homes, Richardson said, and Potatoes USA has increased its social media efforts to “build a broad and dynamic conversation about potatoes….”
 “This has been a turbulent year,” he added. “However, it has shown people how important our industry is to the country and the world.”
 Early during the coronavirus shutdown, “toilet paper, hand sanitizer and potatoes were all out of stock,” Muir said. “When push comes to shove, potatoes are a (must-have) item that consumers have to have at home.”
 State and national potato industry leaders, assisted by Idaho’s congressional delegation, also pushed for relief from USDA for potato farmers impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns, industry leaders said.
 Those efforts helped result in potatoes being included in USDA’s bonus buy program of surplus commodities as well as in USDA’s food box program. In addition, more than $119 million has been provided so far to potato farmers through the federal Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.
 Richardson said the clear steps the nation’s potato industry took during the COVID-19 crisis has put it on a path to recovery.
 “Hopefully, the actions we took can be applied to (other) challenges in the future,” he added.

Britain dramatically shut the door on its 47-year membership of the EU after a 2016 referendum, ending a testy relationship marked by anti-EU euroskepticism, especially among older voters.
 Going forward, relations between the U.K. and Europe could be governed by a trade deal, but only if negotiations currently underway deliver, which is hardly guaranteed given still wide divergences.
 Officials on both sides of the Channel are eying an EU leaders video summit on Thursday as the de facto last chance for a breakthrough.
 This gives negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost just four days and nights to bridge differences that have remained unchanged since talks began in March.
 And this, in turn, might give the European Parliament just enough time to ratify the deal for the end of the year.
 "Logic and reason would all point to a deal," said one EU diplomat with a close eye on the talks.
 "But if anything became clear in the past three years, when it comes to Brexit, economic rationale and pure logic are not enough to explain what's happening," the diplomat said.
 Failure would see the U.K.'s ties with the European economy governed by WTO rules, slapping high tariffs, quotas and other impediments to cross-Channel trade that flowed unencumbered for decades.
 Today's British economy, the sixth biggest in the world, was built on EU membership, with the London financial hub and a tapestry of car plants and multinationals enjoying access to the EU's 450 million consumers and complex supply chains.
 Given the danger, U.K. big business implored the government to find middle ground and replicate the benefits of membership as closely as possible, even if this came with the condition that the U.K. align closely with EU rules.
 But, when the pro-Brexit Boris Johnson became prime minister last year, London went the other way, asking for a zero-tariff deal on goods and services that must, he insisted, leave the U.K. sovereign to make its own decisions.
 With positions starkly apart, the talks, led by EU chief negotiator Barnier and the U.K.'s Frost, became bogged down on three core issues.
 Fishing has been the least economically significant but most politically explosive issue, with Europe eager to keep open access to the U.K.'s bountiful waters.
 Fishermen in France, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands have trawled British waters for centuries, but London wants the access rethought to satisfy Britain's coastal communities, which voted strongly for Brexit.
 Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said, on fishing, Europeans giving ground was "inevitable."
 "If there is no agreement, it will be dramatic; if there is an agreement it won't be great," said the Greens MEP, who sits on the European Parliament's Brexit committee.
 The other obstacle is the lack of faith from the Europeans that once outside the EU single market Britain will play fair in terms of competition rules, even with a deal.
 This view sharpened when Johnson's government introduced a bill in parliament that effectively ripped up the terms of the divorce pact, potentially in violation of international law.
 Under the trade deal, will British companies enjoy easier rules on the environment or food safety only to sell their goods cheaply in the EU, where their rivals must abide by stricter measures?
 Seeking to maintain what it calls a "level playing field," the EU is demanding that Britain make a commitment to not backtracking on standards as well as cooperating on how these evolve in the future.
 The EU is also worried about how the U.K. will subsidize companies, afraid that too much taxpayer largesse could prove unfair toward firms in Europe, where state aid oversight is strict.
 To solve those problems, the EU is insisting that the deal hold some sort of emergency mechanism, that could swiftly inflict penalties if either side breaks the terms.
 "Either the British accept and we then move on to difficult negotiations on fisheries, or they refuse, and we will then be out of time and the negotiations fail," a senior European diplomat warned.
 How matters develop in the next hours or days will be hard to predict.
 Brexit from the very start has had its fill of surprises, delays and disappointments.
 Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said last week that, while an agreement is likely, "it is quite possible that this could fall apart."
 That "will represent an extraordinary failure of politics and diplomacy."

Eleven workers in Effingham County were able to hand count 14,000 ballots Friday, putting them in good shape to finish the presidential race recount by the state deadline of midnight Wednesday.
   
 Olivia Morgan, the director of elections and registration, said the crew worked from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and will return Monday at 9 a.m.
   
 "I feel pretty confident that we should be able to wrap things up on Monday or Tuesday," she said.
   
 They are counting ballots cast by 31,677 people in the Nov. 3 election.
   
 The recount, technically called an "audit," must be finished soon so that the state can certify its results by Nov. 20.
   
 Two members of the Republican Party and two members of the Democratic Party watched the recount. Members of the public also are welcome to watch.
   
 Morgan had said beginning a hand recount on Friday the 13th was par for the course for 2020.
   
 "It's 2020," she said. "They're not making our job easy this year.
   
 Morgan said she doesn't expect the tally will be much different from the one already done by the scanning equipment, but she hopes it will give voters confidence in the new voting system.
   
 The three full-time employees of the elections office were joined by eight poll workers in performing the hand count. Four teams of two workers pulled the paper ballots out of boxes, put them in separate stacks based on whether the vote was for Joe Biden or Donald Trump, then counted the stacks and put the numbers into the computer.
   
 Voters who cast ballots in person already have seen that their votes were recorded correctly on a piece of paper and scanned correctly. But, "Maybe this will go to help people trust this new system," Morgan said. "I hope this reinforces to voters there's no hanky panky going on."
   
 The original tally in the president's race in Effingham was 23,358 votes for Trump and 7,720 votes for Biden.
   
 Morgan estimates the presidential hand recount will cost Effingham County taxpayers about $3,000.
   
 That's in addition to $38,000 the Senate runoffs in January will cost.
   
 The extra expense is just something taxpayers will have to bear. "I have to do these things," Morgan said. "It doesn't matter if the money is allocated."

 If that happens — and increasing COVID-19 numbers have made it all but inevitable at this point — restaurants can only seat patrons outside starting Friday. Churches, gyms, movie theaters and museums, which were also able to operate indoors on a limited basis, will also be restricted to outdoor activity again. With temperatures dipping locally, once again business owners are trying to figure out how to adapt.
 Instead of fans, misters and portable coolers that restaurants invested in over the summer, this time around restaurateurs are scrambling to find tents, patio heaters and propane to keep diners comfortable in chilly temperatures.
 Stephanie Duhart, manager of popular Basque restaurant Benji's on Rosedale Highway, was searching high and low for patio heaters this week. Lowe's and Home Depot were out and renting is expensive, she said. She finally found some at Costco. Then she learned that propane is in short supply locally.
 "Propane is now like toilet paper," she said.
 Indeed, a woman who answered the phone at Home Depot on Mount Vernon Avenue said the store was out of propane and other locations in town were running low. Lowe's website showed the same.
 And that was just one of a number of problems Duhart was dealing with. She was thinking about her 25 employees, and whether they would be impacted by a move back to the purple tier. Business at Benji's, started by her uncle Benji Arduain in 1986, had picked up once the dining room reopened, she said. But how many people will want to eat under a tent outside when it's cold and dark? Will she have to lay off some of her staff?
 "You've got 25 families relying on you to stay open," she said. "They've got families and have to pay rent and want to be able to have a decent Christmas. It's not an easy thing to deal with."
 There's also the fact that takeout isn't a great alternative for a restaurant like Benji's. The traditional meal revolves around the setup, a steady stream of dishes being brought to the table.
 A plate of steaming french fries taste wonderful after a bowl of soup and salad, but they're not the same when they come stuffed in a to-go container, she said.
 While the situation feels all too familiar for some — this is the third time restaurants have had to scale back under COVID-19 restrictions since March — Kern County Supervisor Mike Maggard noted that the dynamic this time around is a bit different.
 For one thing, schools have started to reopen, Maggard said. That will help to alleviate some of the strain for parents. And salons, barbershops and other personal care services have been exempted from the reopening plan and will be allowed to stay open.
 With the election of Joe Biden as president there is also the possibility of another COVID-19 relief plan on the horizon, Maggard said.
 "It's a whole new paradigm in which we're working," he said.
 Maggard, who worked closely with businesses in his previous line of work as an accountant, suggested now is a good time for businesses to strategize about their operations and have a heart-to-heart with their advisers.
 "It won't go back to the way it was, at least for a while," he said. Maybe it's safer and less costlier for a restaurant to stick to takeout and outdoor seating even if indoor seating is allowed again, he said.
 As COVID-19 cases have increased again throughout the state and nation, 11 counties were moved to more restrictive tiers on Tuesday. They were Amador, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Modoc, Placer, Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Siskiyou, Stanislaus and Trinity counties. Of those, Sacramento, San Diego and Stanislaus were moved to the most restrictive purple tier.
 David Goh, senior pastor at The Garden, a church in downtown Bakersfield, said Friday his staff will discuss what to do when the county is officially moved into the more restrictive tier next week. His church had reopened using a reservation system for families to ensure capacity wasn't exceeded and guidelines were followed.
 A spokeswoman for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno said Mass would likely have to go back to being celebrated outdoors if one of the eight counties the diocese covers moves back into the purple tier.
 The city of Bakersfield had offered free permits for gyms, churches and youth sports to operate in its parks. So far permits have been granted to one church, one gym and three youth sports group. A second permit for a gym is pending approval.
 Ralph Fruguglietti, owner of Frugatti's, an Italian restaurant on Coffee Road, said the constant change in how restaurants operate is frustrating but has prompted innovation that he thinks will help the restaurant in the long run.
 "We're always looking to see what can we do better. If you're not going forwards, you're going backwards," he said.
 To that end, the restaurant created a patio around the fountain in front of its entrance, covered with umbrellas for dining in the summer. People loved it, Fruguglietti said.
 He now plans to put up a tent and add patio heaters to the area in anticipation of indoor dining shutting down next week.
 He still gets annoyed. When dining indoors was allowed again, the restaurant began to book up its special event wine cave space next door for holiday events. All but a few days were booked till the end of the year, he said. Those will likely all be canceled or turned into catering orders, he said.
 But because of the pandemic, the restaurant has put more emphasis on improving its takeout service, including expanding family meal options, advertising specials on Facebook and converting iPads no longer used for reservations into an option for customers to place takeout orders.
 When Frugatti's opened 30 years ago, it was meant to be "a loud, Southern Italian, plates clanging" kind of place, he said.
 "We were good at takeout but we weren't great. It's turned us into a good takeout business," he said.
 "I think we've become a better operation because of it," Fruguglietti said of the pandemic and the shifts and changes it has prompted in his business. "If you can take something positive away from it, it's not as bad it seems."

 Abbott's Shield century has certainly dominated the headlines, his 102* was the first of his career and included four boundaries and six maximums.
 But his bowling has also caught plenty of attention, opposition batters regularly commenting that his pace is up on previous seasons.
 His career first-class statistics are 157 wickets at an average of 32.71, but this season's return suggests he's taken his bowling to the next level.
 "Air speed is handy to have especially when we’ve been playing on the flat wickets that we have in Australia," Abbott said.
 "But I’ve done an enormous amount of hard work off the field, especially during this COVID period and time during the winter when we couldn’t always be training.
 "It got to periods this winter where we didn’t need to train, we were ready to go.
 "It helped gain a yard but also sustain that for long periods of time and you want to be at your best on day four when the wickets are flat and you’ve got to take ten wickets to win a game.
 "Because if you don’t take ten 20 wickets in a game of cricket, you’re not going to win.
 "We certainly needed that and to sustain over four days, that’s nice to get and good feedback and hopefully we can keep getting better."
 Abbott recognises that he sits down the pecking order when it comes to pace bowlers in Australia.
 His NSW teammates in Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood are far and away considered the three best fast bowlers in the country.
 An honest chat with selector George Bailey during the recent white-ball tour of the UK gave him more perspective on what he needs to do to crack the Test side.
 Abbott has played five times for his country, including four T20s, but making his debut in the red-ball format is still his ultimate goal.
 And he's prepared to sacrifice playing in the BBL if it means it could get him closer to a baggy green.
 "I’d certainly prefer to be in the place where I’m closer to hopefully playing for my country," Abbott said.
 "That could mean I’m playing a little bit less cricket considering the form that the Test squad is in at the moment, especially the bowling group.
 "We’ve got some great depth at the Sixers and I’m not too concerned that they’d be missing me too much.
 "I had a conversation with George Bailey back in the UK.
 "He called me into his room and we were just talking about roles and that sort of thing for white ball cricket.
 "I was like ‘obviously the dream is to play Test cricket, what do I need to do considering all these things are taking a heap of wickets every year and the four guys that are there at that minute who are doing so well for the country?'

For the second time this week, a Northside girls basketball standout signed a Division I letter of intent.
   
 Tracey Bershers, a 6-foot-2 senior forward for the Lady Bears, signed to play at Oklahoma State University. She made it official at a formal ceremony on Friday after having verbally committed to the Cowgirls in the spring.
   
 "After I had committed, I was pretty set on going there," Bershers said. "I haven't really looked anywhere else.
   
 "I don't like the de-committing and doing all that; once I commit, I want to stay there. But yes, I was dead set on going there pretty much."
   
 Bershers didn't get to take an official visit to OSU due to COVID-19. But she had constant contact with OSU coach Jim Littell and his staff, which really sold Bershers on signing with the Cowgirls.
   
 "The coaches, that was a really big one for me," she said. "I'm close to my high school coaches, I'm close to even my AAU coaches and we just kind of hit it right off the bat.
   
 "They've been watching me for a while. ... I couldn't go on my official visit yet, so they sent me videos and stuff and the facilities are super nice, and I just love the conference they're in (the Big 12). I'm excited to get to play."
   
 Bershers added Littell is more than anxious to have his newest signee on board.
   
 "Coach Littell is real close with (Lady Bear) Coach (Rickey) Smith and he asked Coach Smith after they offered me, 'Can't she graduate early and come, because we need her right now,' Bershers said.
   
 "I think they expect me to come in and they want me to play a little bit right off the bat because they need shooters and they want me to come in and play and just provide for the team."
   
 Bershers will be a four-year starter this season for the Lady Bears.
   
 As a junior, she averaged 15.4 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. The season before, Bershers averaged 8.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.0 blocks per game while helping Northside to the 6A state championship.
   
 During her Lady Bear career, Bershers has averaged 11 points and 6.6 rebounds while accumulating 953 total points.
   
 She is the second girls basketball standout from the River Valley in as many years to sign with OSU. Last season, Muldrow forward Taylen Collins signed with the Cowgirls, and she is now a freshman on the OSU roster.
   
 Oddly enough, Bershers admitted she doesn't really know Collins very well.
   
 "I really don't know her that well; I've heard her name before and I know she's from Muldrow," Bershers said. "I have friends that grew up with her but I've never met her actually."
   
 Bershers is also the second Lady Bear to sign with a Division I school this week, joining point guard Jersey Wolfenbarger, who inked with Arkansas.
   
 "It's unheard of really, and since we've been playing with each other since we were freshmen, it's kind of cool to sign to DI schools," Bershers said of Wolfenbarger. "That was our goal since our freshmen year, so it's really cool and unheard of to have two DI signees and it's just really special."
   
 In addition, Bershers is the second member of her family to sign to play basketball at a DI school.
   
 Her older sister, Sara, signed with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, where she is a sophomore guard. The Bershers sisters were teammates on the 2019 Lady Bear 6A title squad.
   
 "We talk every once in a while, and I'm like, 'I'm ready to go to OSU and get there,' and she's like, 'Just enjoy your senior year while you have it,'" Tracey Bershers said.
   
 "She just wants me to enjoy being in high school when I can and close to the family and home."

President Donald Trump is the projected winner of North Carolina's electoral votes, according to NBC, ABC, and CNN. Trump currently leads by more than 70,000 votes in the state.
   
 And while votes are still being counted in a statewide hand recount, President-elect Joe Biden was projected as the winner in Georgia, according to the same TV networks. Biden leads in Georgia by about 14,000 votes.
   
 "At the end of the day, more people voted in Georgia, for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, than voted for Donald Trump and Mike Pence," said well-known election lawyer Marc Elias of the law firm Perkins Coie in a telephone press briefing by the Biden campaign. "And there isn't anything that a count or a recount or, or, you know, legal action is going to do to change that."
   
 Georgia and North Carolina were the last two states without declared winners in the presidential election.
   
 Biden surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency Saturday after winning Pennsylvania.
   
 Georgia is in the midst of an audit of the presidential election, which comes in the form of a hand recount of nearly all 5 million votes in the state.
   
 The state's deadline to certify its results is Nov. 20, and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has said election workers will work overtime to get it done. He denied claims the recount is in response to calls from the Trump campaign to recount the vote, and Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling said the recount would have happened if Biden were the one trailing in the state.

 The latest vote tallies gave the Democrat Biden a clear win in the state-by- state Electoral College that decides the presidency, with 306 votes against Trump's 232. Two hundred seventy votes are required for election.
 But Margarita Urtubey, 49, a horse breeder from Miami, said the election was "so corrupt," adding, "Trump won by a landslide. We are here to march for the 'stop the steal' of this election, to make our voice heard."
 Trump tweeted that "hundreds of thousands" had turned out -- while his spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany made the greatly exaggerated claim that more than a million people were present.
 But the turnout was undoubtedly high for a strongly Democratic city, boosted by protesters from around the country, from Florida to Pennsylvania to Colorado.
 Darion Schaublin, who drove from Columbus, Ohio, said "the whole system's rigged... in the way that the information is getting to the people."
 "The truth never actually gets out," said the 26-year-old, who says he lost his job in a restaurant after refusing to wear a mask to help stop the spread of Covid-19.
 Kathlin Erickson, who said she flew from Colorado on a plane "filled with Trump supporters," kept alive hopes of a second Trump administration.
 "A Trump victory? That's a long shot, but anything is possible with God," she said.
 Trump is impeding Biden's transition ahead of inauguration on January 20 and has filed numerous lawsuits -- unsuccessfully -- to challenge vote counts around the country.
 He said Friday "time will tell" if he remains president, in a momentary slip of his refusal to concede defeat.
 Despite his own intelligence officials' declaration this week that the election was "the most secure in American history," Trump and his right-wing media allies show no sign of giving up their quest to get the results overturned.
 After driving past the marchers in Washington, Trump headed to his golf club outside the capital as he kept to his regular weekend routine.
 Half a dozen supporters stood at one side of the entrance with Trump flags, and about the same number stood on the opposite side with a big "Biden Harris" sign and one that said: "We voted. You're fired."

 "I keep saying I don't think it helps me in terms of the shots that I hit out there or anything like that," he said of the new perspective fatherhood has brought. "But I think just the approach to the game ...
 "As soon as you get home you're not thinking about yourself, you're thinking about something else. It's nice to get away from the thought of the tournament sometimes."

Algoma District School Board is ending the separation of its in-class and remote elementary learners during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Starting Tuesday, students who are studying online will join their classmates, via video, in classrooms. They will no longer be in their own online classrooms where students were drawn from different schools. All current virtual learners will have new teachers.
 "We did not consider this option in August, as we were monitoring parent choice and our ability to accommodate both modes of learning,” said director of education Lucia Reece in an email. “Since September, we have received ongoing requests from families for changes to their child’s mode of learning. Accommodating such requests has caused, and would continue to cause, multiple changes of teacher, change of classroom/cohort and change of classroom.”
 With the move, no additional restructurings will be done in the new year.
 The English public board has fielded 319 requests from parents wanting to change the teaching delivery model for their children since September.
 Cameras “will be focused on the teacher and the teaching area at the front of the classroom” to protect the privacy of classroom students, superintendent of education Marcy Bell told trustees during a committee of the whole meeting on Nov. 10.
 Parents learned last week if their children, who are attending schools, must change classrooms due to the learning delivery shift.
 "Once we do this reorganization that is it and they are in place until June,” said Bell.
 Parents can now move their children between remote and face-to-face learning in the same classroom.
 Students will not go to school Monday. It is a transition day for staff to learn how to use communication platform Microsoft Teams and learning management platform Edsby for the hybrid model. Physical layout of classes will be adjusted . Educators will share information about the strengths, needs and interests of their students. Children meet their teachers online.
 "This is not an easy decision for administration to make,” said trustee Sheryl Evans-Price. “We have to think of sustainability of the system.”
 Meanwhile, Huron-Superior Catholic District School Board is keeping its in- class and remote learning options separate.
 About 500 students are studying online. The board’s enrolment is about 4,600.
 "We’re just more comfortable with teachers teaching in one modality and we’re comfortable with students in that environment as well,” said director of education Rose Burton-Spohn.
 Some classrooms at Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary Virtual Academy and Our Lady of Fatima and Our Lady of Lourdes in Elliot Lake will be reorganized on Monday.
 "We have tried to contain the number of classes that have been affected,” said Burton Spohn.
 She estimated about 15 classes between the three schools are impacted. Split- grade classrooms may move to one grade. Teachers could be transferred.
 "When you add a classroom or you remove a classroom then it can domino throughout the entire organization,” said Burton Spohn.
 No educators will be cut.
 "Largely it’s movement of staff within a building,” said Burton Spohn.
 Classroom shuffles are usually done in September once schools see the actual number of students compared to projected enrolment. HSCDSB decided to wait for the reorganization to coincide with the fall date when students could switch between remote learning and in-class instruction.
 "Rather than putting families and students and staff members through two reorganizations what we thought was we would delay that until November,” said Burton Spohn.
 About 50 students have opted to study online, while approximately 85 are returning to classrooms. The 135 students represent 3 per cent of enrolment.
 "It was interesting for us to see how little movement there actually was,” said Burton Spohn. “By and large many parents have chosen to stick with the same modality that they selected in September.”
 Students can change their type of instruction again on Feb. 8.

 # Jensen Beach's Blair Stoneburg, LPA's Jake Sciscente put on a show at 2A state swimming

 Saturday was anticipated to be a monster night for one of the Treasure Coast’s top swimmers at the 2A FHSAA Swimming and Diving championship.
 It turned into a great night for two.
 Jensen Beach junior Blair Stoneburg doubled her career gold medal count with three on the night and Lincoln Park Academy junior Jake Sciscente blew away his expectations by winning his first two career gold medals on a big night for the Treasure Coast swimming contingent at the Sailfish Splash Waterpark in Stuart.
 Stoneburg, a Wisconsin commit, was dominant in her two specialty races, winning the 200 freestyle by nearly eight seconds that earned her Automatic All-American honors and was just a shade over three tenths behind the state record held by Stanford All-American Morgan Tankersley.
 In the 500 freestyle, Stoneburg’s margin of victory was nearly 15 seconds, again earning Automatic All-American honors. The race that meant the most for the Falcon star was the 400 freestyle relay, as she was the anchor leg that brought home the victory, teaming up with her Brynn, junior Madeline Kohs and senior Emily Miller.
 Wanting to help her senior teammate who has shown her the ropes throughout the years end her high school career in style was the cherry on top of a brilliant evening for Stoneburg.
 “She’s put in so much time and energy into this team and I’ve always looked up to her,” Stoneburg said. “To do that last relay for her and for the team and for everything we’ve worked for this season, it was really special.”
 Several Falcons made the podium to help the girls’ claim third place behind runner-up Gulliver Prep and state champion Pine Crest. Brynn Stoneburg was fourth in both the 200 freestyle and 500 freestyle behind her sister in each race. Miller took seventh in both the 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle and the same relay team that took gold in the 400 freestyle took home silver medals in the 200 freestyle relay.
 The satisfaction of seeing herself do as well as she did along with the effort her teammates displayed made the night fulfilling for Blair Stoneburg.
 “I’ve been working so hard with my coaches over these past couple months coming out of COVID-19 and I’m really happy with the swims I put together and my team put together today,” Stoneburg said. “There’s always room for improvement and I think that’s something really exciting looking towards the future, but Jensen Beach and I feel like myself had a good swim and meet today.”
 For Sciscente, entering Saturday's meet, he had never finished higher than sixth in any race at a state meet. In the 200 freestyle, he needed to dig deep on the final turn and hit the wall five tenths ahead of Rockledge's Elliot Wiesel to claim his first gold of the night.
 Entering the 100 backstroke as the No. 2 seed, Sciscente lowered his time from the morning prelims and comfortably touched the wall ahead of the pack to earn his second gold.
 Reaching new heights at the same pool in which he grew up and developed his skills, Sciscente was well prepared to set out what he believed he could accomplish.
 "During regionals about a week ago at this same pool, I was going through my races experimenting on what pacing I should do in the 200 and 100 backstroke and I went in with the mindset that I had the ability to push my limits as far as they could go,” Sciscente said. “I really felt that my races today showed exactly what I was capable of.”
 The Greyhound boys with Sciscente leading the way finished ninth as a team with senior Grayson DiBernardo earning a sixth place finish in the 100 butterfly and the 200 medley relay team consisting of DiBernardo, younger brother Noah DiBernardo, senior Spence Wagner and seventh grader Kaleb Cason taking seventh.
 It was a strong night as well for Jensen Beach sophomore Ayden Cason, who took fourth in the 100 freestyle and added an eighth place finish in the 200 freestyle.

Poplarville (8-3) came out firing on all cylinders, putting up 21 unanswered first quarter points using their signature wing-T offense and dynamic running backs.
 Hornet back Tyron Holsten broke the scoring seal on the game's first drive with a 15-yard scamper. With the extra point, the Eagles faced a 7-0 deficit.
 After the Eagles' first offensive drive stalled, Poplarville took to the ground again in the second drive starting from its own 34.
 On the first play, fullback Gregory Swan burst through the middle of the Eagle defense then raced down the sideline before being brought down at the South Pike 15. Dj Richardbey then scored on the following play with a run of his own making it a 14-0 lead for the hosts.
 Looking for a spark, South Pike took the air but things didn’t pan out very well. Quarterback Chris Royal's first pass attempt of the game sailed over the outstretched arms of Brandon Johnson and into the hands of Hornet defender Jamaya Henry for an interception that he returned to the Eagle 34. A few plays later, Holsten took sweep play around the left sideline and followed a convoy of blockers for a 30 yard touchdown. The extra point put the Poplarville up 21-0 heading into second.

Running back Bryson Carroll threw his first career touchdown pass to quarterback Trae Hall to give New Mexico (0-3, 0-3) a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter.
 Tyson Williams intercepted a screen pass by Hall that bounced off the hands of the intended target and on the next play Doubs caught a 33-yard pass from Strong in the back of the end zone to make it 10-10 with 3:21 left in the first half. George Steinkamp kicked a 48-yard field goal about two minutes later to put New Mexico back in front at the break.
 Talton, a sophomore, moved into a tie for eighth in program history with 29 career field goals. Brothers Marty and Tony Zendejas made 72 and 70, respectively in the 1980’s.
 The Lobos have indefinitely relocated their football program to Las Vegas due to strict guidelines regarding COVID-19 throughout New Mexico.
