There’s no denying that every single business investment will carry with it some level of risk. Ever-increasing and evolving government regulations, economic conditions, new competitors and emerging technologies ensure that regardless of the type of business you want to start or are currently running, there are always going to be some risks to get to grips with and ensure that you are prepared for.

GRANT: I’ll try to think of an example. You know all those films I did with Richard Curtis, like _Notting Hill_ and _Love, Actually_ and _Four Weddings and a Funeral_? They’re comedies, but I have a feeling that they worked because they were dealing with a quite painful love. And it was real, because Richard Curtis, although he’s a very funny guy, has suffered more than most people I know, on the horns of terrible, unrequited love affairs. So for him, those scripts were a way of dealing with pain.

“You’d have to ask Dennis Allen about that,” Jenkins said, referring to the Saints defensive coordinator. “It was a package that I just wasn’t in. I take a lot of pride in being available and being on the field as much as possible, but it made me feel a lot better that we won the game.”

GRANT: I think first up is better. There are people who just don’t give you off-camera what they’re going to give on-camera, at all. I won’t name names, because I can’t be bothered with the stress afterward, but it’s a surprising number who just don’t really care about doing it when they’re not on camera, and it does screw you up.

If Twitter was going to keep playing this game, the company was going to have to block users from being able to see a government website, which certainly would not be a good look for the social media company that has come under fire on numerous occasions for disproportionately censoring conservative voices over liberal ones.

In recent years, the actor, now 60, has shown a dramatically different side to his acting prowess, building a fascinating and rigorous resume by taking on a range of difficult, complicated, morally compromised characters who you might prefer to see stepping out in front of a bus rather than riding off into the sunset. In 2018, he played the closeted, murderous parliamentarian Jeremy Thorpe in the 1960s and ’70s period miniseries _A Very English Scandal_ (for which Grant was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe). Earlier this year, he chewed the scenery—and then spit it out—as a dubious private eye in Guy Ritchie’s heist ensemble, _The Gentlemen_. This fall, he tackles the role of the dashing, possibly homicidal oncologist husband to Nicole Kidman’s Upper East Side therapist in the HBO murder-mystery series _The Undoing_. Amid the lacquered backdrop of New York City, Grant juggles charisma and chilliness with dexterity, making him the perfect suspect in a thriller that runs on the unreliability of pretty appearances.

The upcoming festive season seems like the bright side to an otherwise morose year. And while celebrations will be muted and contained to one's own home, there is no reason why you can't raise a toast to better days ahead. And what better way to do that than with one the finest Japanese whiskies. A rage in the spirits world, Japanese whiskies appeal to, both, cocktail as well as whisky aficionados. And adding a fine option to the range of Japanese whiskies is Beam Suntory's Toki. An exquisite blended whisky, it is a marriage between Suntory's Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita. To the nose, it is fresh and light with a fruity aroma derived from green apple, a soothing touch of honey, a speciality of Chita, wrapped in pleasant basil. The gentle notes of grapefruit and green grapes, which is a trademark of Hakushu, leads to an interlude of peppermint and thyme which plays on the palate. A hint of vanilla oak, white pepper and ginger lends to the subtly sweet and spicy finish, a trademark of Yamazaki. The smoothness of the whisky allows it to be savoured neat, or on the rocks as a highball. Commenting on the process behind the blend, Shinji Fukuyo, Chief Blender at Suntory, says, “Toki is a blend of grains from our Yamazaki, Hakushu and Chita distilleries, resulting in a delicate balance of mouth-watering flavours that are unique in character and boldly innovative. The Yamazaki American white oak cask malt whisky reinforces the sweetness of the Chita heavy-type grain with peach and custard aromas. By including a second Yamazaki malt - the Yamazaki Spanish oak cask malt whisky - the woody and bittersweet notes are accentuated, adding to the smooth finish.” Guaranteed to add your celebrations, Toki - meaning ‘time’, is not only a great addition to your collection, but also an impressive gift option.

GRANT: Out of the blue, when I’m doing a scene that’s not very challenging, I’ll be overcome with shocking nerves. I start shvitzing from my armpits, and the makeup people can’t bring sponges fast enough to get rid of the sweat from my face. I can’t breathe, I can’t remember my lines, and it’s extremely embarrassing. I went to see a shrink, and he told me that the answer is to go away and do a lot of press-ups, so that’s what I do. I manage it better now than I did. But you really cheered me up by telling me that you’re so nervous before day one of a shoot that you actually throw up. Is that true?

GRANT: I feel like I’ve had too much synthetic life. I used to say that when people asked why I’d done all this political stuff with Murdoch, and then more recently when I made a huge effort to try to prevent this latest British government becoming the government, because I thought they were lethal, really, and I think I’ve been proven right about that. People ask me, “Why bother to do that?” And I say, “Although it’s stressful, it’s a lovely relief, after decades of creating synthetic life, to be dealing with real life.” It’s got some texture. You get your teeth into it, and people are not nice to you. In our world, too many people are lovely to us. And I have found that in the world of politics or campaigning, it’s brutal out there, and it feels quite bracing.
