But the owners of some small hotels and motels have complained of being shut out of the process. LAHSA, which is responsible for operating the hotels, has asked negotiators to target properties of 100 rooms or more to ease the logistics of contracting for food service, security, healthcare and case management.
 Echoing Steinberg, Roberts said his agency has had to scramble to find people with the proper training to help run the hotel shelters. Still, he’s very pleased with how quickly they’ve gotten rooms up and running.

While the phrase Please Believe These Days Will Pass can initially feel flippant or reductive, the simple repetition of it being plastered on billboards feels powerful, like a 20ft mantra on your daily walk. This arresting presence is a conscious move by Titchner. "I've tried to think about what someone can take on board as they pass by. So I tend to use short, sharp words," he explains. "The whole atmosphere of the work is supposed to be like a voice, someone addressing you in a certain way. It could be helpful, it could be aggressive, it could be a friend." For the artist, this faceless voice, accompanied by a sunset-coloured backdrop, creates a sort of temporary escape from the day-to-day.

Governments cannot openly admit that the "controlled easing” of COVID-19 lockdowns in fact means controlled progress toward so-called herd immunity to the virus. Much better, then, to pursue this objective silently, under a cloud of obfuscation, and hope that a vaccine will arrive before most of the population gets infected.
