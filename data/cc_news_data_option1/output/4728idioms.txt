BATON ROUGE, La. (WAFB) - Just about every in-person event is going virtual this year due to COVID-19.Fundraisers, benefits, and even holiday shopping markets.Before you buy anything, make sure you know exactly where your money is going.These virtual pop-up holiday markets or craft fairs could be legitimate events but scammers are creating fake copycat events that charge admission.Their goal is to steal your banking and personal information when you go to pay the admission fee.That’s why the Better Business Bureau of South Central Louisiana is warning shoppers to do their research before checking out.“We know that 2020 is different so people are trying to adapt with their businesses and virtual is the new way to go," said Carmen Million, CEO and President of the local BBB. "But there are some things that consumers and businesses need to be aware of when they’re talking about these virtual events. One is if you know that there is a virtual event you need to do your homework you don’t need to just click on a link that you received. You need to do your homework. You need to look at what they’re offering and what the rules are.”Million said usually, these markets are not going to sell tickets up front so if somebody asks you to purchase a ticket and they ask for your credit card information and some personal information consider that to be a red flag.If a website or even page looks credible in asking for an admission fee Million recommends directly calling the organization hosting the event.If the holiday market is an actual event and you find some things you want to buy, use a credit card or a PayPal account.“At the end of the day if you don’t receive the merchandise or if you receive it and there’s something wrong with it then you have the option to dispute it through your credit card because you haven’t actually paid for it yet. Of course when you use a debit card they immediately remove it from your bank account so then you have to negotiate with your bank to try to get your money back and that’s not always the easiest thing,” she explained.Before you check out know what the return or exchange policy is. It is the buyer’s responsibility to know whether they’re able to get their money back for an item they don’t want.Million also advises online shoppers to keep an eye out for pop-up ads.“When you’re searching online, and we all do this, and we’re searching for a particular item you’re going to get all of these pop ups. We recommend that you not open up the pop-ups. You want to make sure that you’re researching and that you’re not providing information so they can hack into your computer because one of the scams that’s involved in this particular online purchasing is that they will bring you to another site by a pop up and they will steal your information, they will take control of your computer and they may even release malware onto your computer. So you really need to be very cautious. Investigate before you give any personal information and always check with the Better Business Bureau before you order from a particular company," Million said.If you think you have been scammed you can always report it to the BBB through its live Scam Tracker online.When shoppers report their mishaps it helps the BBB figure out where the scammers are targeting and hopefully it can help the shopper recoup their losses.Click here to report a typo.Copyright 2020 WAFB.

TBS reports with the national figureThis comes as Tokyo reports a record of more than 500 cases in the Japanese capital, with a few other prefectures also reporting record daily figures notably Hokkaido (+266), Aichi (+219), Osaka (+338). That will make it two consecutive days that Japan reports over 2,000 new daily cases following that of yesterday.Meanwhile, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike is out saying that citizens need to take extra care when eating in groups. I guess that underscores the sense of urgency - or lack thereof - felt by officials for the time being as the virus situation continues to gather pace.

W. David Hemingway was born on April 28, 1947 and for 73 years David enriched the lives of those he met through encouragement and kindness. He always enjoyed a challenge and rarely encountered a problem he couldn't solve. It was because of his knowledge and character that the heavens above demanded his return home on November 16, 2020. While his friends and family who have passed on before him are celebrating his return those of us who remain on earth will miss him dearly.        David married the love of his life Gay Etta Jorgensen, and they raised three sons Ryan, Jonathan and Jamon. Family was very important to David and he was loved and adored by his grandchildren. David had a very playful side and the grandkids could always count on a fair amount of teasing and learned quickly to tease him right back. I know it is said that you can't teach an old dog new tricks but after a great deal of effort by the girls David was well trained in the art of playing Ken in the game of Barbie. His generosity knew no bounds and at sleepovers he often relinquished his own bed so the grandkids could sleep with Gigi in the big bed.        In addition to the fun and games David valued education and found time to pass on his love of investing. It was rare to have a visit from Grandpa that didn't include a list of interesting companies and stocks to buy. Despite Grandpa's efforts on teaching the importance of diversification one or two of the grandkids learned an unforgettable lesson as they watched their stock of choice lose most of its value.        After David graduated from the University of Utah with his MBA he went to work for Zions Bancorporation. David loved Zions so much he never left. In his 45-years at Zions not a day went by that he didn't strive to make Zions the best. After David's successful career as Chief Investment Officer for Zions Bancorporation he approached his retirement with the same passion and zeal as only he could. Most people retire and pick up hobbies such as golf or fishing, but David loved to take the road less traveled and started to produce a documentary on near death experiences titled "Through the Veil." He worked to improve people's lives through education and started working with numerous people at the State and Federal level in an attempt to better the world around him.        He spent a great deal of his personal time in the pursuit of knowledge and was a dedicated member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He served a LDS mission to Brazil and had a great love for the scriptures.        He is survived by his wife, Gay Etta, Salt Lake City, sons, Ryan (Karalee), Jonathan, (Phoebe), Jamon (Alexandria) Grandchildren, Ryley, Haley, Kaitlin, Elise, Sterling, Vienna, Avery and Jonas. Siblings, Mike (LeeAnn), Delwin, (Janis) Mary (Ed) Bywater, Flora Shumway and Jan (Ray, deceased) Mecham, and a host of loving nieces and nephews, cousins.        A public viewing will be held 6-8PM on Friday, November 20 at Larkin Mortuary, 260 E. South Temple, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Masks and social distancing will be enforced per the COVID requirements.        Funeral services will be held on Saturday, November 21, 2020 beginning at 11AM for family attendance only. Friends are encouraged to attend the services virtually with a link that can be found at www.larkincares.com where memories and condolences may be shared with the family. Interment at Salt Lake City Cemetery.       In lieu of flowers David would hope that you share your kindness and generosity with someone in need.

My beloved husband of 59 years left me on November 8 to join our Lord and Savior in Heaven. He was born in Youngstown, Ohio on September 2, 1938 to Ralph and Teresa (Schwellinger) Hersman. His loving baby sister, Kathryn was born in 1942. After graduating High School he joined the Army; then spent a short time working in the steel mills. He grew tired of that very quickly. He came to California in 1959 and vowed to never live where a palm tree could not grow. He went to work for the telephone company where he met his future wife, LaDene.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We moved to Santa Barbara where we started our family by welcoming a daughter, Kathleen. Dave applied to the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's department and was hired as a Deputy in 1963. He at last found his dream job. He attended every school and class that was offered and excelled in all of them. When he had enough tenure, he took the Detective's test. He got the promotion and was off and running. At this time, we moved to Solvang where we welcomed our second child, a son we named Mark. As time went on, he progressed through the ranks. He made Sergeant, Lieutenant, and ultimately, Commander. He attended the FBI academy and taught criminal law at Allan Hancock College for five years. Upon his retirement, he was honored by notables from President Clinton, the FBI, Santa Maria Police Department and Guadalupe Police Department. The honors that meant the most to him were the ones given by his colleagues and co-workers. He felt that he had worked thirty-five years for the finest department in the land.

CHICAGO (WLS) - One 72-year-old man in Illinois is finally out of the hospital after an eight-month battle with coronavirus.“It has changed me completely,” Mike Margelewski said. “I mean, I can’t do anything like I could before.”Mike Margelewski was taken by ambulance back to his home this week. He had been in and out of hospitals and rehab facilities since April.During his battle, the father, husband, and longtime city of Chicago employee was in a medically induced coma and was on a ventilator twice.“The first couple of days, it wasn’t too bad, and then it was like somebody just turned out the lights. I don’t remember nothing,” Mike Margelewski said.His wife Pam Margelewski was at his side and was his advocate when the prognosis was grim.“He went into acute respiratory failure twice and even coded. For a while, all of his organs were not doing very well. Everything was shutting down and it was all from COVID,” Pam Margelewski said.After months of fighting for his life, Mike Margelewski has a message for people who still said COVID-19 just isn’t that bad.“Just take a look at me and you will find out that it is real,” he said.His family is asking for people to take the virus seriously.“You don’t believe it? Come over here, come look at this 72-year-old man, who by the way only had high blood pressure when he went to the hospital,” Pam Margelewski said.Mike Margelewski isn’t fully out of the woods yet. He still has to go through rehab and dialysis from home.Copyright 2020 WLS via CNN Newsource.

Getting nowhere in the courts, President Donald Trump’s scattershot effort to overturn President-elect Joe Biden’s victory is shifting toward obscure election boards that certify the vote as Trump and his allies seek to upend the electoral process, sow chaos and perpetuate unsubstantiated doubts about the count.

(KSLA) - This stretch of great weather is about to come to an end, sadly. We will have the clouds increase and the rain return by next week. Temperatures will at least be cooler though!Overnight, it will be chilly again, but not quite as cold as the last few night. It will cool down to the lower to mid 40s. Maybe only a select few spots will get down to the upper 30s, but not many. It will be quiet otherwise with no clouds and no rain.Thursday will be another great day too! In fact, this could be the last great day before things start to change. So, try to get out and take advantage of the sunshine and enjoy the warm temperatures. There will not be any rain with temperatures warming up to the mid 70s.Friday will bring some changes with the clouds on the increase. There will still be sunshine mixing its way in, so it will not be a completely cloudy day. Temperatures will still be warm and increase to the mid 70s. Good news is that it will remain dry with no rain.Saturday will have a few more clouds around. Some sunshine is still likely though. It will stay dry as the rain is still nowhere to be found. Temperatures will remain warm and heat up to the mid 70s. This might be our warmest day of the week.Sunday will have more clouds and limited sunshine. A cold front will be getting ready to move in later in the evening. There will be some rain later in the day, starting near the I-30 corridor. Through most of the day, it will stay dry though. Temperatures will increase to the lower to mid 70s despite the lack of sunshine.That rain should be more likely north of I-20, and will be coming to an end as we approach sunrise Monday. I think by the time we start the day, it will all be gone. So you may not need your umbrella. You will need a jacket though as temperatures will only heat up to the lower 60s.In the tropics, Iota is nothing more than just remnants now. The rain is finally coming to an end in Central America. There is an area in the Caribbean with a 10% chance of development. This is decreasing from earlier in the week, so this is good news. Another area in the Atlantic has popped up and has a 20% chance to develop. Even if anything does, it will move east away from the United States.Have a great rest of the week!Copyright 2020 KSLA.

“Teens are often tempted to use group and anonymous messaging apps due to social media FOMO [fear of missing out],” says Daniel Markuson, digital privacy expert at NordVPN. “Communication platforms usually make kids feel safer and bolder, making them reveal too much information, participate in cyberbullying, or even make risky decisions.”                     Most apps that should be used with caution usually have a few common features. These include anonymous messaging, the ability to chat with strangers, and self-destructing messages, images, and videos. “With features like these, your child can hide important things from you. Most importantly, they could get involved in cyberbullying, sexting, online predators, and much more,” Daniel Markuson notes.                     And yet, dangerous or unsafe social media apps usually aren't dangerous as such. It is people with ulterior motives abusing these apps that make them risky. By taking advantage of a social media app, an individual may extract personal information for stalking your child online. Not only could they make the child a target of cyberbullying, but also one of sexual harassment, unethical social engineering, etc.

"The aim of Green Schools is to create environmental awareness among not only the students, but teachers, non-teaching staff and parents involved in the running of the school.

“When we’re back playing, fingers crossed, in that January time period, we can start to get that other exposure of thrust and you really see it on ice,” Jennings said. “And as excited as I am now, I’m so always excited to see when it comes to watching a professional athlete put it on and get out on the ice."

Kumamoto - Kumamoto Prefecture approved Thursday the restart of a decades-old controversial dam construction project that was halted 11 years ago, following the deadly flooding of a major local river triggered by torrential rains in July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Kumamoto Gov. Ikuo Kabashima said during a prefectural assembly meeting that he gave the green light to the central government plan to build a dam on the Kawabe River, the main branch of the flood-hit Kuma River, withdrawing his earlier opposition to the project over environmental concerns.

The prices are supported by demand in mainland China and a smaller-than-expected build in US inventories as reported by the Energy Information Administration.

To create a safe environment for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles existing workshop buildings will have to adapted and upgraded. Workshop upgrades are designed to detect a potential hazard, dilute the gas to reduce ignition risk, and then extract the gas for safe re-entry. Local regulations and health and safety laws may vary and dictate exactly what adaptions need to be made in the workshop. However, at minimum, a process must be in place for safely defueling the bus before certain operations. All electrical equipment must be classified for hazardous locations to avoid sparks.

All this started at a brainstorming session at Adidas' “Creator Farm” in Brooklyn a few years ago when Commissioner Gary Bettman and other executives got to hear about some jersey ideas. Adidas senior director Dan Near said a 2018 survey showed 22 of the 25 most popular jerseys in a fan survey were retro or defunct, which set the wheels in motion for what he called a “complicated but pretty rewarding process.”

Such student groups do not become effective because they are hindered from serving the purpose of the group.”

Luckily, many of the big providers have offers – it seems common to see discounts for 3 months this Black Friday (NOW TV Sky Sports pass also recently saw 50% off for 3 months).

“My favorite treatment hands down is Sculptra. Sculptra is a collagen stimulator that has gained popularity in recent years — it’s unlike a traditional hyaluronic acid filler. Sculptra is a “bio stimulator” that stimulates your own collagen production, which helps to restore facial volume. Sculptra also enhances the tone, texture, and integrity of your skin, sometimes referred to as the “Sculptra Glow.” Sculptra evolves gradually so your results are natural and long-lasting, sometimes longer than two years. Typically patients see results in eight weeks and maintain with one or two vials annually. Your birthday is a good time and a reminder to come in for maintenance.”

Londa Nwadike, state extension food safety specialist with the University of Missouri and Kansas State University, said, "If you want to have leftovers after Thanksgiving, buy 1 pound of whole turkey per person." A rule of thumb is 3/4 pound of turkey per person if you don't want leftovers or if you're cooking a turkey breast.

During his four-day trip to Tokyo earlier this week, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach likened the forthcoming Tokyo Games to “a light at the end of the tunnel.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Successfully hosting the Olympics would serve as a symbol of humanity’s resilience in overcoming the novel coronavirus, Bach said during his first visit to the capital since the Summer Games were postponed in March for a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Y como hace falta frio -mas o menos, pero hace falta- para el almacenamiento, hay que estar muy atentos y aprovechar infraestructuras ya existentes, adaptandolas. En esto, Asturias puede jugar un papel importante, porque cuenta con instalaciones en las que se puede usar nitrogeno para el enfriar, como declaro la semana pasada Borja Sanchez, consejero de Ciencias, Innovacion y Universidad, al valorar la propuesta inicial del sindicato minero SOMA-UGT de acondicionar los pozos mineros asturianos para almacenamiento a temperaturas muy bajas.

The alliances have therefore been tasked to look at key areas of economic growth: Sustainability, enabling safe and innovative visitor experiences, facilitating smart commerce, digitalising the built environment, digitalising supply chains, robotics and educational technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The solutions the alliances have come up with include creating more tie-ups between companies so that shoppers are engaged both online and offline, and launching two autonomous transport shuttles by the end of this year, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said separately on Thursday in a press release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This comes amid the increasing popularity of e-commerce and a greater demand for personalisation and engagement, as well as the need to address the country’s manpower crunch, the ministry said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Other concepts in the works include a carbon market where carbon credits are exchanged and a system for companies to measure, mitigate and offset their carbon footprint.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa
 One player in the South Africa cricket squad has tested positive for the coronavirus ahead of a six-game limited-over series against England and two others have also been isolated after being in close contact with him.
 Cricket South Africa said the positive result came back among 50 tests conducted on Wednesday on players and support staff before the squad goes into a "biosafe environment" in Cape Town ahead of the games, which start at the end of next week.
 The three players who have been isolated are showing no symptoms of COVID-19, CSA said. None of the players were named.
 England's squad flew in to Cape Town on Tuesday on a chartered flight and all the players were negative for COVID-19 after arriving, the England and Wales Cricket Board said.
 The England and South Africa squads will stay in the same hotel in Cape Town in a controlled environment throughout the series. England players need to observe 10 days of quarantine before the games but are being allowed to train at the Newlands cricket ground during the quarantine period.

The body of a man killed in a 1985 church shooting in north Camden County was exhumed Wednesday as part of a new investigation conducted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Stacy Carson, special agent in charge of the GBI office in Kingsland, said the body of Harold Swain was exhumed to search for DNA evidence that could potentially link another person to the shooting deaths of Swain and his wife, Thelma, 35 years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The investigation was reopened earlier this year after Dennis Perry, convicted in the shooting deaths, was released from prison after being behind bars for 20 years. Lawyers on Perry’s behalf argued during a hearing in July that newly obtained DNA evidence would have eliminated their client as a suspect at the time.

She suggested that it could be Dr. Elvis Francois -- a surgeon who gained viral fame earlier this year with an emotional cover of "Imagine" that was posted online.

KitchenAid is the gold standard in stand mixers, proving popular in the Black Friday sale every year. Very has a great discount for an early Black Friday offer, and if you’re certain this is for you, it’s a deal we’d recommend. Anyone into their cooking shows will be used to seeing the KitchenAid grace the screen whether that’s Nadiya Bakes (she’s got a nice pastel one) or Nigella (her one is hot pink) – it’s clearly a talking point and a must-have for any serious chef. This deal is on the graphite rather than the popping colours you see on TV, but we’re sure other colours will appear with deals soon – red and cream were both on offer last year.

Once you’re finished with “Mangrove,” perhaps you’d like to indulge in a little holiday fantasy, like, say, “Dolly Parton’s Christmas on the Square,” a glossy musical coming to Netflix Sunday. Christine Baranski plays a Scrooge in stilettos who is trying to evict an entire town by Christmas eve. Dolly, naturally, plays an angel who visits to convince her otherwise. And if that weren’t enough, it was directed and choreographed by none other than Debbie Allen.

Worldwide, more than 1.3 million people have died of COVID-19 and over 55 million have been infected with the virus since it first surfaced in China late last year, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. In Switzerland, one of the worst-hit countries in Europe, the Swiss Society for Intensive Care Medicine (SSMI) warned that intensive care units "are practically all full".

"If you want to have leftovers after Thanksgiving, buy 1 pound of whole turkey per person," Nwadike says. A rule of thumb is 3/4 pound of turkey per person if you don't want leftovers or if you're cooking a turkey breast.

The COVID-19 condition he’s experiencing is rare for a young man his age without underlying conditions," his rep says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        "His family would like to remind the world that COVID-19 is real and not to be taken lightly," the statement continues. "Also, It’s important for people infected to quarantine and let their families and friends know ASAP. There’s no shame in contracting COVID-19, and people that have it need to be responsible and considerate of others. Everyone diagnosed with COVID-19 is affected differently, Unfortunately for Jeremih, COVID-19 viciously attacked his body."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "The family is very grateful for everyone who is praying, and we ask for continued prayers. The family believes daily prayers to God and a great team of doctors and nurses is helping him pull through," the statement concludes. "He’s not out of the woods yet, but progress is being made. The family and friends are praying that he starts breathing on his own soon, and makes a full recovery."

In more than 5,500 cities, Brazilians voted for mayors and city councilors on Sunday. The wave of political renewal that two years ago catapulted Bolsonaro to the presidency appeared to ebb in the face of well-known candidates and traditional parties, which scored the most votes in the two most populous cities. Of the nearly 60 candidates whom the leader backed, only nine advanced, according to a tally by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo.

Unfortunately, new highs in hospitalised Covid-19 patients in the US and positive testing at a six-month peak both point to more deaths due to the virus. While a full lockdown is not on the cards yet, the risks of other US states following actions in New York as winter becomes harsher need to be taken into consideration. We will not know the economic consequences for several weeks, but clearly activity will slow significantly. That's when US politics will come back into focus and stimulus talks will become more market-moving than vaccine news.

BRUSSELS (AP) — NATO could pay a heavy price for leaving Afghanistan too early, its chief warned Tuesday after a U.S. official said President Donald Trump is expected to withdraw a significant number of American troops from the conflict-ravaged country in the coming weeks.NATO has fewer than 12,000 troops from dozens of nations in Afghanistan helping to train and advise the country’s national security forces. More than half are not U.S. troops, but the 30-nation alliance relies heavily on the United States for transport, air support, logistics and other assistance. It’s unlikely that NATO could even wind down its operation without U.S. help.NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, wearing a face mask stands next to Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis before their meeting in Athens on Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2020. Stoltenberg warns there may be consequences from a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan.“We now face a difficult decision. We have been in Afghanistan for almost 20 years, and no NATO ally wants to stay any longer than necessary. But at the same time, the price for leaving too soon or in an uncoordinated way could be very high,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement Tuesday.He said Afghanistan still “risks becoming once again a platform for international terrorists to plan and organize attacks on our homelands. And ISIS (Islamic State) could rebuild in Afghanistan the terror caliphate it lost in Syria and Iraq.”The U.S. decision comes just days after Trump installed a new slate of loyalists in top Pentagon positions who share his frustration with the continued troop presence in war zones. The expected plans would cut U.S. troop numbers almost in half by Jan. 15, leaving 2,500 troops in Afghanistan.U.S. officials said military leaders were told over the weekend about the planned withdrawal and that an executive order is in the works but has not yet been delivered to commanders.NATO took charge of the international security effort in Afghanistan in 2003, two years after a U.S-led coalition ousted the Taliban for harboring former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. In 2014, it began to train and advise Afghan security forces, but has gradually pulled troops out in line with a U.S.-brokered peace deal.Stoltenberg said that “even with further U.S. reductions, NATO will continue its mission to train, advise and assist the Afghan security forces. We are also committed to funding them through 2024.”NATO’s security operation in Afghanistan is its biggest and most ambitious undertaking ever. It was launched after the military alliance activated its mutual defense clause — known as Article 5 — for the first time, mobilizing all the allies in support of the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington.“Hundreds of thousands of troops from Europe and beyond have stood shoulder to shoulder with American troops in Afghanistan, and over 1,000 of them have paid the ultimate price,” Stoltenberg said.“We went into Afghanistan together. And when the time is right, we should leave together in a coordinated and orderly way. I count on all NATO allies to live up to this commitment, for our own security,” he said.The United States is by far NATO’s biggest and most influential ally. It spends more on defense than all the other countries combined. But Trump’s term in office has marked a particularly tumultuous time for the organization. He has routinely berated other leaders for not spending enough on defense, and has pulled out of security agreements that European allies and Canada consider important for their security, such as the Iran nuclear deal and the Open Skies aerial surveillance pact.French President Emmanuel Macron said last year that NATO was suffering from “brain death,” in part due to a lack of U.S. leadership.Stoltenberg has refrained from publicly criticizing Trump or his decisions since Trump came to power in 2016.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Fact is, as a result of this forced isolation of sorts, human behavior has become chaotic. Do you believe there is an appropriate response to anything any longer? After spending close to a year in closed quarters, the reflex of making small talk is extremely difficult to say the least. What if, you have to take that flight to that seminar and socialize with a bunch of people you haven’t met? Where would you start? When panic and built in drama has been your fodder for a year, how do you rationalize?

A new walking initiative is being launched in Derry to get people out and about during these tough times.

Those who exhumed Harold Swain’s coffin and re-interred it left little sign the grave at the back of the cemetery and near the church had been disturbed. The slab had been replaced over the top of his grave and the ground around it smoothed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Swain said he was one of six siblings left of 20 from a blended family, 10 on each side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  After he arrived at the cemetery, Carson called him and told him the GBI had informed a “Mrs. Clayton,’’ Thelma Swain’s sister, of the exhumation. He wasn’t totally satisfied with that and told Carson Mrs. Clayton was not related to his side of the family.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Swain said he wasn’t in a position to say who killed his brother and that he had sat in court every day of Perry’s trial and believed officers had the right man.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “I’m sorry Mr. Perry went to jail,’’ he said. “I went with the evidence I had.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Swain said it still hurts years later and remembers how it felt when he got the call that his brother and sister-in-law had been slain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  “It’s awful to hear your loved ones getting killed just over foolishness,’’ he said.

Black Friday wouldn’t be Black Friday without TV deals. The best TV deals are often found at retailers like Currys or AO.com, but Very is giving them a run for their money this year with a great 4K TV offer. You’ll also start to see TV bundle deals appearing the closer Black Friday gets. Currys is already offering a Nintendo Switch with its LG OLED TV. If you’re confused just remember from best to worst picture quality: 8K, 4K/Ultra HD, Full HD, HD ready and standard definition. QLED in a nutshell means greater brightness, OLED means better contrast generally and lower power usage. Below, we’ve rounded up our top TV picks.

When Liz Sether went hunting for a sculptor recently she had a pretty good idea where to start.
 “The internet is the way to go these days,” Sether said with a laugh.
 Sether’s family has owned a farm a mile west of Carlisle near Lake Oscar for six generations. She grew up there and it has always been a special place for her.
 Sether got the notion one day to do something extra special at the farm. She wanted some trees in the yard reshaped by someone who was good with a chainsaw. The person she hired for the project was Jason Soderlund from Chisago City — a community only 12 miles from the Minnesota-Wisconsin border.
 Soderlund was working on a dairy farm in northeastern Missouri when on one of his days off he decided to visit a chainsaw sculpting competition near Quincy, Illinois. That trip changed his life.
 “I experienced the art form for the first time and immediately became mesmerized and hooked,” Soderlund said.
 Soderlund apprenticed with a chainsaw sculptor from Brainerd for two years before striking out on his own. He currently runs a business in Chisago City called “Soderlund's Wood Mill” with his brother, Josh. They create and sell rustic furniture along with carved signs and chainsaw carvings.
 The job Sether had in mind was the sculpting of four trees in the farmyard. She had quizzed the family about what shapes she should ask Soderlund to sculpt. One of her great-nephews had recently shot a bear so that was his suggestion. A great-niece suggested an owl. Sether already had an idea of her own. Bowing to her roots, she decided to ask for a gnome.
 “My mom and dad are 100% Norwegian so you have to go with something Scandinavian,” she joked.
 After sending pictures of the trees to Soderlund and describing the type of trees they were, Soderlund said he was interested and would take the job.
 “He was so personable, I think that is what sold me on him,” Sether said.
 Only one of the four trees would not work according to Soderlumd, a boxelder. The rest were oak and ash and would work very well.
 “A tight-grained wood makes a great sculpture,” Soderlund said.
 Soderlund’s truck and trailer arrived at the Sether farm on a Thursday and 4 ½ days later he departed — leaving two bears and a gnome behind.
 There was only one obstacle of any note to be overcome. Soderlund was not wild about the idea of leaving his property parked by a motel at night and the three-hour, 175-mile drive from Chisago City to Carlisle was quite a haul.
 With permission of the family he ended up staying on the Sether farm and taking his meals with the family. By the time he left his employer said “he was practically a member of the family.”
 Soderlund only travels a great distance for on-site work a few times a year. That is what made staying on the Sether farm so special.
 “It’s a real neat place and I really feel grateful for her letting me stay there. You need to be right by the work at times,” Soderlund said.
 His 17 years as a chainsaw sculptor has taught Soderlund plenty about his unique craft.
 “You have to kind of see what you are going to be leaving in before making your cuts,” Soderlund said. “I have a rough idea of what I want to do. It just starts out very rough and then it just gets refined and refined more until I have the basic shape.”
 Soderlund has always had an interest in art and as an artist he has to be pleased with what he does.
 “That’s first and foremost,” Soderlund said. “I have to be happy with it. I have never had a situation where I have been extremely pleased and the customer has not been happy with it.”

Five judges will determine the best recipe after the time limit to prepare the meals ends.

What we've done is we've drilled it, as we've said before, and now we've tested it and oil has come to surface, actually free floating oil has come to surface. That means we've not stimulated it by swabbing, we've not stimulated by a pump, it's just come up because of the pressure. It's good quality oil, it’s 36 API, it’s light oil, and we're very pleased with the results because obviously it's a first and our medium pre-bill estimates, we’re looking at initial production over 200. Just how over 200, it will be wrong to say at this stage, we would prefer to err on the side of caution, simply because there's no analogues, it's alright testing at over 36 hours but in terms of longer term production, you want to see what's going to happen to the reservoir, especially where there's going to be water coming through and such like.

Declassato a tempesta tropicale, l’uragano Iota, il trentesimo della stagione, ma per gli esperti quello atlantico piu forte, dopo aver devastato il Nicaragua gia sconvolto dal tifone Eta del 3 novembre, ha attraversato l'Honduras e ha toccato infine terra ne El Salvador con venti fino a 65 chilometri orari. Nel piccolo Stato caraibico un motociclista e morto dopo essere stato colpito da un albero sradicato dal vento e 800 persone sono state evacuate. Secondo il Centro nazionale degli uragani negli Stati Uniti, Iota ora si indebolira ulteriormente e raggiungera il Pacifico sotto forma di "sistema a bassa pressione".

ABC’s “Big Sky,” from veteran writer-producer David E. Kelley (“Big Little Lies”), is a Montana-set thriller driven by the kidnappings of two sisters on a road trip. There’s marital discord and a rift among the private detectives on the case, to boot. Kylie Bunbury, Katheryn Winnick and Ryan Phillippe top a cast that includes sterling character actors John Carroll Lynch (“The Founder,” “Fargo”) and Valerie Mahaffey (“Dead to Me,” “Young Sheldon”). The series, debuting 10 p.m. EST Tuesday, is based on novels by C.J. Box featuring investigator Cassie Dewell, played by Bunbury.

But there's also the simply perfect Gillian Anderson as Thatcher, and Emma Corrin as Diana to add to the magic.

Zimbabwe came back from two goals down to hold Algeria to a 2-2 draw and boost their chances to qualify for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Cameroon. Goals from Andy Delort and Riyad Mahrez fired Algeria into a two-goal lead before Knowledge Musona and Prince Dube found the back of the net to draw level.

But enforcing statewide orders can be easier said than done.

Trump's Mideast plan, which overwhelmingly favored Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians, would allow Israel to annex up to a third of the West Bank, including all of its settlements there, which are home to nearly 500,000 Israelis.

It was among the iciest transitions of power in U.S. history. The coming Jan. 20 may do it one better. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if President Donald Trump — who is as sore a loser as he is ungracious a winner — makes like President Andrew Johnson and skips Biden’s inauguration. That wouldn’t be a bad thing for the country, either, despite the predictable handwringing over yet another tradition defied. Out of sight, out of mind — though it’s hard to imagine Trump staying out of sight — or out of earshot — for long.

The pressure was not limited to disparaging remarks. The Detroit Free Press said the election board site was spammed with messages containing personal details of the dissenting Republicans and links to their social media pages with the apparent goal _" to create offline consequences"_ for Palmer and Hartmann. Some people who were outraged by the holdup called for the places where the two work to be found out and revealed, while one commenter offered a reward for anyone willing to confront them in person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  There was also similarly vicious pushback against Democratic representative-elect Abraham Aiyash. One of the online critics, he accused Palmer of _" deciding to enable and continuing to perpetuate the racist history of this country,"_ and suggested that she should think about what that means for her kids and their future interactions with black schoolmates. The remarks went viral and were interpreted by many as a threat against Palmer's family, causing a wave of anger against Aiyash.

After the Second World War, many professors who had survived returned, and began organizing the university from scratch, giving lectures to almost 4,000 students in the ruins of the campus. The buildings were gradually rebuilt and until the late 1940s the university remained relatively independent.

"Trying to create those fans remotely is slightly harder, but at the same time, touring for emerging artists is expensive," said Lord. "So, rather than spending that money when you might just keep saying 'yes' to stuff because it feels like the right opportunity, take that distraction away and really concentrate on the creative side and work on building your audience in other ways. Then, when you are ready to hit the road again, you're coming with a bigger catalogue and people who've been desperate to see you."

W. David Hemingway was born on April 28, 1947 and for 73 years David enriched the lives of those he met through encouragement and kindness. He always enjoyed a challenge and rarely encountered a problem he couldn't solve. It was because of his knowledge and character that the heavens above demanded his return home on November 16, 2020. While his friends and family who have passed on before him are celebrating his return those of us who remain on earth will miss him dearly. David married the love of his life Gay Etta Jorgensen, and they raised three sons Ryan, Jonathan and Jamon. Family was very important to David and he was loved and adored by his grandchildren. David had a very playful side and the grandkids could always count on a fair amount of teasing and learned quickly to tease him right back. I know it is said that you can't teach an old dog new tricks but after a great deal of effort by the girls David was well trained in the art of playing Ken in the game of Barbie. His generosity knew no bounds and at sleepovers he often relinquished his own bed so the grandkids could sleep with Gigi in the big bed. In addition to the fun and games David valued education and found time to pass on his love of investing. It was rare to have a visit from Grandpa that didn't include a list of interesting companies and stocks to buy. Despite Grandpa's efforts on teaching the importance of diversification one or two of the grandkids learned an unforgettable lesson as they watched their stock of choice lose most of its value. After David graduated from the University of Utah with his MBA he went to work for Zions Bancorporation. David loved Zions so much he never left. In his 45-years at Zions not a day went by that he didn't strive to make Zions the best. After David's successful career as Chief Investment Officer for Zions Bancorporation he approached his retirement with the same passion and zeal as only he could. Most people retire and pick up hobbies such as golf or fishing, but David loved to take the road less traveled and started to produce a documentary on near death experiences titled "Through the Veil." He worked to improve people's lives through education and started working with numerous people at the State and Federal level in an attempt to better the world around him. He spent a great deal of his personal time in the pursuit of knowledge and was a dedicated member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He served a LDS mission to Brazil and had a great love for the scriptures. He is survived by his wife, Gay Etta, Salt Lake City, sons, Ryan (Karalee), Jonathan, (Phoebe), Jamon (Alexandria) Grandchildren, Ryley, Haley, Kaitlin, Elise, Sterling, Vienna, Avery and Jonas. Siblings, Mike (LeeAnn), Delwin, (Janis) Mary (Ed) Bywater, Flora Shumway and Jan (Ray, deceased) Mecham, and a host of loving nieces and nephews, cousins. A public viewing will be held 6-8PM on Friday, November 20 at Larkin Mortuary, 260 E. South Temple, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Masks and social distancing will be enforced per the COVID requirements. Funeral services will be held on Saturday, November 21, 2020 beginning at 11AM for family attendance only. Friends are encouraged to attend the services virtually with a link that can be found at www.larkincares.com where memories and condolences may be shared with the family. Interment at Salt Lake City Cemetery.In lieu of flowers David would hope that you share your kindness and generosity with someone in need.

Grandpa wanted Ike to be able to hit the ground running, without suffering a fate similar to his own. Because Franklin Roosevelt compartmentalized, when he died on April 12, 1945, Grandpa ascended to the presidency knowing virtually nothing about how the White House had been running things.
