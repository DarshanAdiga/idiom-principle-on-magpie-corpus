With the election now behind us, COVID-19 still with us, and a cold winter packed with usually commemorated holidays before us, 2020 isn’t celebrating a happy ending any time soon. In fact, California Governor Gavin Newsom is throwing out even more guidelines and restrictions for families who want to spend the holiday season together. With Thanksgiving a week away, families are getting a lot of information about how they should spend their social gatherings with proper social distancing. The guidelines, when first announced in late October, were met with earned mockery, but since then, Newsom has come out and stated his guidelines are just that, guidelines. I was a teacher once. If I told my students late papers weren’t accepted, that was not a guideline; it was a rule. These series of guidelines are easy for wealthy people with families, but are a nightmare for poorer people who just want to see their families.

 Taysom Hill intends to treat the next couple of games on the New Orleans Saints' schedule as if the trajectory of his career as an NFL quarterback is in the balance.
 "There are a lot of really great players that didn't get an opportunity in the NFL and these opportunities are few and far between," said Hill, who knows better after not getting his first NFL start at QB until last weekend -- at age 30.
 "So my mindset is to do everything I can to take advantage of every single opportunity," Hill continued. "I'm preparing as hard as I can ... and each game is a big game for me."
 If this is indeed Hill's audition to succeed 41-year-old starter Drew Brees long term, then it's off to a promising start.
 In a 24-9 victory over Atlanta last weekend, Hill completed 78.3% of his passes for 233 yards without an interception and ran for two touchdowns.

Recasts with U.S. Navy statement)
 MOSCOW, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday one of its warships caught and chased off a U.S. destroyer operating illegally in its territorial waters in the Sea of Japan, but the U.S. Navy denied wrongdoing by its vessel and accused Moscow of making excessive maritime claims.
 The Admiral Vinogradov, a Russian destroyer, verbally warned USS John S. McCain, a U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, and threatened to ram it in order to force it to leave the area, prompting it to return to neutral waters, Moscow said.
 Russia said its Pacific Fleet warship had been tracking the American destroyer in the Peter the Great Gulf, and that the U.S. vessel had violated Russia's territorial waters at 0317 GMT by going two kilometres beyond the sea border.
 But the U.S. Navy said its warship had been in international waters throughout as it carried out a "freedom of navigation" operation to assert its rights and challenge what it said were Russia's excessive maritime claims.
 "...the United States will never bow in intimidation or be coerced into accepting illegitimate maritime claims, such as those made by the Russian Federation," said Lieutenant Joe Keiley, 7th Fleet spokesperson.
 "The Russian Federation's statement about this mission is false," he said. "USS John S. McCain was not 'expelled' from any nation's territory."
 The U.S. destroyer made no further attempts to enter Russian waters after leaving the area, Moscow said. The Admiral Vinogradov was continuing to observe its movements and another vessel, a corvette, was dispatched to the area, it added.
 Such incidents at sea are rare, but they underscore the poor diplomatic and military relations between Russia and the United States whose ties are languishing at a post-Cold War low.
 The last remaining major arms control pact between the former Cold War foes is due to expire in February despite months of talks to find a replacement.
 Also, President Vladimir Putin has yet to congratulate U.S. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden with his Nov. 3 election victory over President Donald Trump.

Given such a history, mistrust is not irrational, and the only way to overcome it will be to treat it with respect. Ultimately, the answer is to end the medical racism that affects so many Black people around the world — the belief that Black bodies don’t feel pain, the inability of doctors to recognize life- threatening symptoms on darker skin and the inequitable care given to Black patients across the board.

Germany announced Wednesday that it will push for Europe to ban ski holidays in a bid to curb coronavirus infections, while cases of Covid-19 reached a new peak of more than 60 million globally.
 The prospect of a cold, dark Christmas behind closed doors without the classic fresh air-filled sojourn on the slopes stretched before Europeans as Americans faced their own holiday gloom on the eve of a subdued Thanksgiving.
 US President-elect Joe Biden cited accelerating plans to deliver a vaccine as he appealed for his "weary" countrymen to dig deep.
 "There is real hope, tangible hope. So hang on. Don't let yourself surrender to the fatigue," Biden said in a televised Thanksgiving address.
 "You will get your lives back. Life is going to return to normal. That will happen. This will not last forever."
 Biden spoke as a tally of official sources compiled by AFP showed that 60,014,291 infections leading to 1,415,258 deaths have been recorded around the world since the new coronavirus emerged in China late last year.
 The number of infections -- roughly equivalent to the population of Italy -- likely only reflects a fraction of the actual total, as many countries lack testing capacity.
 Rising cases have seen countries around the world impose new restrictions in recent weeks, though some -- such as France and the United Kingdom -- have begun cautiously opening back up again.
 Germany, however, announced Wednesday that it will extend its virus curbs until 2021 and plans to seek a deal with European partners to close ski slopes until January 10.
 The statement from Chancellor Angela Merkel dovetailed with French plans announced one day earlier to shutter ski resorts through the year's end. Infected tourists at ski resorts helped spread the virus across Europe earlier this year.
 "I will say this openly that it won't be easy, but we will try," Merkel said.
 The move put Berlin and Paris on a collision course with resort operators and holiday hotspot Austria ahead of the crucial Christmas season.
 In non-EU member Switzerland, however, skis resorts are open -- although police have been spotted patrolling to ensure that skiers respect anti-Covid measures such as wearing masks and social distancing.
 \- 'Ready to feed 4,000' -
 In the US, travel appeared to be down the night before Thanksgiving, when Americans usually criss-cross the country to be with family and friends for the carbs-laden feast marking one of their most important national holidays.
 With more than 150,000 cases daily in the US, which has the world's highest death toll of more than 259,000, health authorities had for the first time ever called for Americans not to travel for the annual holiday -- but stopped short of issuing an outright ban.
 In recent days images on social media of crowded airports fueled concerns Americans were not taking the warnings seriously.
 But one day before Thursday's celebrations, officials and passengers in Los Angeles noted an eerie quiet compared to previous years.
 "The plane was basically empty. There was only a handful of people there," Nathan Peterson, a student arriving in LA from Utah on Wednesday, told AFP.
 "On a normal Wednesday morning before Thanksgiving out here, there would be a lot of traffic behind me. Typically, we have a quarter of a million passengers ... coming through here," airport spokesman Charles Pannunzio said.
 US food banks on the other hand have seen long queues in recent days as the economy continues to stagger under the pandemic.
 "We are ready to feed 4,000. Me and my crew, we worked constantly at this, just to make sure that whoever didn't have was able to have a nice Thanksgiving meal this year," said David Thomas, head chef at the Los Angeles mission.
 \- 'Zombie mutant killer minks' -
 With the end of 2020 in sight, the virus continued to batter the global economy.
 Britain is expected to see its greatest annual slump in more than three centuries, with the government forecasting the economy will shrink 11.3 percent on coronavirus fallout.
 Finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled plans to slash the foreign aid budget to help mend the battered finances, prompting one minister to quit and defying impassioned calls to protect the world's poorest people.
 And the pandemic began heaping new pressure on the animal world.
 While in Denmark a rushed cull of minks over concerns about a coronavirus mutation has left the country facing a new horror, as cadavers of the animals re-emerge from the earth, lifted by pressure from gases released by the decomposition.
 Photos and videos of the macabre phenomenon have set social media abuzz, with one Twitter user dubbing 2020 "the year of the zombie mutant killer minks".

Adds details on transition decision)
 By Trevor Hunnicutt
 WILMINGTON, Del., Nov 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden focused on building his incoming administration and offered a message of healing on Tuesday as his transition team began contacting federal agencies to prepare for a handover of power in January from President Donald Trump.
 The Democratic former vice president has been moving swiftly to assemble his team and make Cabinet choices after defeating the Republican incumbent in the Nov. 3 election. Trump has waged a flailing legal battle to try to overturn the results, falsely claiming that the election was stolen from him.
 "The election is over. It's time to put aside the partisanship and the rhetoric designed to demonize one another. We have to come together," Biden, due to office on Jan. 20, said on Twitter on Tuesday.
 Trump has said he will never concede the election but after weeks of limbo his administration on Monday finally gave the green light for the formal transfer of power to begin. That process had been held up despite Biden emerging as the clear winner and world leaders recognizing him as the next president.
 Monday's announcement meant the Biden team qualifies for $6.3 million in funds and among other things can officially coordinate with the 17 agencies that are part of U.S. intelligence gathering, according to the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service.
 The Biden team also gets access to federal office space, secure facilities for intelligence briefings and the succession plans for executive agencies. In addition, the State Department typically supports a transition team's discussions with foreign leaders.
 One of the first departments that Biden's team reached out to was the Pentagon, underscoring the importance of emphasizing national security during the transition. Trump fired Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Nov. 9.
 In a small but symbolic move hours after the transition announcement on Monday night, Biden opened a ".gov" website available only to government agencies for his transition, launching buildbackbetter.gov.
 LEGAL BATTLE
 Critics have said Trump's refusal to accept the results and approve the transition of power to Biden undermined U.S. democracy and undercut the incoming administration's ability to combat the intensifying coronavirus pandemic that has killed about 258,000 Americans and left millions more without jobs.
 The administration's decision to allow the transition to go forward followed meetings at the White House, including one with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Trump, who called in by phone, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 The source said it did not mean Trump was giving up on his legal battle to try to overturn the results in number of states or conceding, but that it was the appropriate thing for the process.
 "He's not throwing in the towel," the source said.
 Asked how long the legal challenge could go on, the source said it could not go past Dec. 14, when electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia convene as an Electoral College to formally select the next president.
 Trump's legal strategy has hinged on stopping certain states that he lost from certifying their election results, an effort that has met no success. Michigan on Monday certified its results showing Biden the winner, while Pennsylvania's governor said on Tuesday his state had done so as well. Trump won both states in his 2016 victory.
 Trump and his lawyers have promised new lawsuits in their fading legal fight, which has dwindled to two appeals of rulings against the campaign and a case in Nevada by electors pledged to Trump seeking to nullify the state's election results.
 NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY
 Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are due to formally introduce their foreign policy and national security teams on Tuesday in Wilmington, Delaware. On Monday, the Biden team said it had tapped Antony Blinken to be U.S. secretary of state, Jake Sullivan as national security adviser, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security.
 Biden's foreign policy is likely to focus on repairing Washington's relationships with key U.S. allies in Europe and around the world and taking new paths on issues like climate change.
 Attention is also building on Biden's possible pick to become treasury secretary, whose first task will be to steer the government's response to the economic fallout of the pandemic.
 Biden is likely to tap former Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen to become the next Treasury secretary, two Biden allies said on Monday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 Yellen, who would be the first woman to hold the job, is a seasoned economist and labor market expert respected by Congress and Wall Street. Her appointment would shift the department away from the tax cuts and easing of financial regulations that were the paramount focus under the Trump administration.

Updates with Jehovah's Witnesses reaction, adds details)
 MOSCOW, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Masked law enforcement officers carried out mass raids on the Jehovah's Witnesses across Russia on Tuesday and made a number of arrests as part of a new criminal case against the group, the Investigative Committee said.
 The law enforcement agency said it had opened an investigation as it suspected the Christian denomination was organising the activity in Moscow of its national centre and affiliates.
 Yaroslav Sivulskiy, a spokesman for the European Association of Jehovah's Witnesses, denied the centre had resumed its activity and said the group was being targeted in a campaign of persecution.
 Russia's Supreme Court ordered the Jehovah's Witnesses to disband in 2017 after labelling it extremist, and some of its adherents have since been jailed or hit with criminal charges in a crackdown.
 On Tuesday, black-clad officers used a crowbar and an axe to break down a door to gain access to one property, footage released by the Investigative Committee showed.
 The agency said it had identified a number of group organisers and followers and had taken them into custody as part of its investigation. It said in a statement that searches had been carried out in more than 20 regions.
 Some adherents have met privately in a flat in northwest Moscow from June 2019 to discuss and study religious literature relating to their faith, and have converted some Moscow residents, it said .
 Six Jehovah's Witnesses were detained in the Russian capital during the searches, Sivulskiy said.
 The Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia where the Orthodox Church championed by President Vladimir Putin is dominant.
 Putin said in 2018 that he did not understand why authorities were pursuing the group and called for the matter to be analysed.
 The Kremlin declined to comment on Tuesday.
 Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions. (Reporting by Alexander Marrow and Maxim Rodionov; Writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Angus MacSwan)
