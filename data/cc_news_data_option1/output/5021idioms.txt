Since the Great Recession more than 10 years ago, few mainstream credit card companies have put effort into lending to subprime borrowers or to the poor. Credit card companies are now focusing most of their attention on middle- to upper-class borrowers, who typically have jobs allowing them to work remotely and are not in businesses that have been shut down due to the virus.

Shacter’s career as a ceramic artist began in Los Angeles, California, in the early 1960s where he worked with Otto and Vivika Heino at the Chouinard Art Institute, and later with Hank Murrow and Dora De Larios. For Shacter, De Larios was an important early influence and friend. After several years Shacter opened his own studio and shop called The Venice Pottery Gallery, and in 1968, as part of the back-to-the-land movement, he moved to Point Arena on the Mendocino coast. It was here that he continued developing his functional ceramic pieces, while also exploring new ways to work more creatively in clay, mostly by altering forms and allowing the material to become more expressive. Several years later, he moved on to Synanon in San Francisco to establish a working pottery called Synanon Ceramics, which he operated from 1974–80. Upon leaving Synanon Ceramics, he began working seriously in porcelain, which also led to his investigation of the teapot as a sculptural art form. These pieces, for which he later became well known within the ceramics field, were both time consuming to create and more difficult to sell in order to sustain a living.

Government leaders, including Gov. Tom Wolf, have stated repeatedly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic that science must be the key to the state’s policies and the public’s response.
 That science is dependent on data, but the pandemic has exposed some significant shortfalls in the state’s own standards and procedures.
 Early in the crisis, the administration’s definitions for essential and nonessential businesses was inconsistent, and the media and some lawmakers had to file Right-To-Know requests to obtain information that should have been readily available.
 To the administration’s credit, it has adjusted as the pandemic has progressed, applying what it has learned from the early phases to the latest wave of infections.
 Yet state and federally regulated nursing homes, in which more than 60% of the state’s early cases occurred, still have not been brought up to speed regarding state-mandated reporting on COVID-19 as the second wave continues to grow.
 The state requires nursing homes to report weekly on their residents’ and staffs’ positive tests, infections and deaths. But according to an analysis by The Times-Tribune, compliance is spotty, at best.
 On average, for example, 100 of the state’s 693 nursing homes failed to report their figures in one or more weeks between Sept. 28 and Dec. 1.
 Accurate information not only guides policy but is fundamental to public trust in long-term care.
 As put by Nancy Newcomb, president of fully compliant St. Mary’s Villa in Lackawanna County, “Being honest with the press, our residents and their families provides everyone with a sense of trust.”
 Once this crisis finally passes, the Legislature and administration should ensure that the state has modern, comprehensive procedures in place for collection and public transmission of its own data, and to ensure full compliance by relevant institutions.

The Indian National Lok Dal on Monday extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting at the Delhi borders against the new central agri-marketing laws.Abhay Singh Chautala said his party had announced its support to the protesting farmers the day the agitation started, adding that "each and every worker of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) will fight this battle shoulder- to-shoulder to strengthen this movement so that the Centre is forced to abolish the three black laws imposed on the peasants"."Our party has decided to extend full support to the Bharat Bandh," he said.Chautala, younger son of INLD president and former chief minister OP Chautala, said he will visit the Tikri border on December 9 and meet the farmers and leaders leading the stir.In a statement here, the INLD leader said no farmer organisation of the country had demanded the new agricultural laws, but the central government enacted the "black farm legislations to benefit the corporates".He reiterated his demand that the Centre withdraw these laws and guarantee minimum support price (MSP) of crops to farmers, and also make provisions of punishment for whoever buys the crop below the MSP.Chautala also appealed to all political parties that they should rise above party politics and stand with farmers to lend strength to the agitation.At a press conference here last week, Chautala had asked the Centre to immediately accept farmers demand to repeal the three farm laws, and asserted that the party was "solidly behind the farmers fighting against the three laws".Claiming that their agitation has spread across the nation, farmer leaders, who have maintained that their protest is apolitical, have welcomed the support and urged all to come forward to make Bharat Bandh a success.After five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions failed to end the impasse, the two sides are again set to meet on December 9, a day after the countrywide strike.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre, however, has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

With the increasing advancement of technology across the world and in India, coding is not just any other subject, but it is a method of mental development. Students develop long computational thinking and algorithmic intelligence and are able to break down a problem in a structured form by using art, design, and other creative techniques through coding. In today's time, coding is the most discussed and developing idea. In the view of teachers, experts, and parents, coding is important for children, preferably at an earlier age. Nowadays, most private schools have coding as a mandatory subject.
 While government educational institutions across the country are working their way out to come at par with the private schools and institutions, the Delhi government has been proactive in revolutionising education in its schools. Keeping in mind the importance of coding and the ongoing focus on the subject, the Delhi government has introduced HT Codeathon for government school students.
 During their second term in 2015, the Delhi government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, focussed its reforms to improve and modernise the existing education system. The education department of the Delhi government, under education minister Manish Sisodia, began developing from the scratch the educational infrastructure in the national capital.
 Starting with making new school buildings, establishing world-class schools of excellence, state of the art classrooms, swimming pools and gyms, the Delhi government transformed the old, rickety condition of the educational infrastructure under the state government. With time, the Delhi government also realised that for the development of the education system, upgradation of the infrastructure would not be enough. Education minister Sisodia began brainstorming with experts and introduce innovative elements such as happiness curriculum and entrepreneurship curriculum. The Delhi government also focused and developed student-teacher parents' interactions with the concept of mega PTMs.
   
   
 Smart education is the key to envision a smart future. Cultivating coding skills among school going students is essential to developing a problem- solving approach and ultimately imparting more algorithmic thinking to make complex problems easier. To promote critical thinking among students, the Delhi government has launched various initiatives to disseminate the language of coding among students. A similar, one-of-its kind initiative is She Codes, which involves building a strong foundation of learning coding and tech skills among girl students in Delhi government schools.
 The Delhi government partnered with She Codes in January. The idea was to build up coding and programming skills in the girl students. The first phase of the partnership was envisioned, where around 1000 girl students of Class 6 in the Delhi government schools were taught coding. Apart from imparting the specific coding skills, the aim was also to build algorithmic logical thinking in the students.
 During the pandemic, the focus of the programme shifted from coding to animation, which was taught remotely. In the last couple of months, the students have created animated videos, delivering a wide range of social messages on their YouTube personal channels. In the second phase, these students will be specifically taught programming.
 Recently, the Delhi government has partnered with HT Codeathon, through which the government is targeting to teach coding to the students of the Delhi government schools.
 During a recent interaction with students and teachers on the progress of the HT Codeathon sessions, Sisodia, while lauding the efforts and achievements of the students, said, "It is my dream to see our students create their own companies like Google, and watch them take it worldwide. Coding is giving these students the wings to fly from an early schooling stage."
 Under the HT Codeathon programme, 13.461 students from about 1,000 Delhi government schools are being trained in coding and programming skills. 2,567 students have completed all five chapters till date.
 Chief minister Kejriwal applauded the Codeathon initiative. "Being a trained engineer from the IIT, I have always realised the importance of technology and the scientific minds and methods. Childhood and school education are the most important parts of any person's life. Just the way charity begins at home, the basic learning of even the most complex subjects should begin from the very childhood. The Delhi government's initiative of teaching coding to the children will not only open a new door of their learning but also create an example in front of the world that the government schools can also dream big and make it happen," he said.

Os dados estão descritos pelos cientistas em artigo publicado na última sexta- feira (4) na revista científica PNAS, da Academia Nacional de Ciências dos EUA.
 Segundo os pesquisadores, a diferença da eficácia entre as cidades provavelmente esconde o fato de que algumas delas já tinham alta adesão ao uso de máscaras mesmo antes da exigência por lei.
 ## Bom custo-benefício
 Os resultados de sucesso em várias delas no período analisado, dizem, dificilmente podem ser atribuídos a outro fator.
 "Uma analise detalhada do histórico de todas as medidas de saúde pública nas regiões que estudamos garante que estamos atribuindo corretamente nossas descobertas às màscaras faciais, e não erroneamente a outras medidas", escrevem Mitze e colegas.
 Isso não significa que outras medidas, como implementação de quarentena e distanciamento social, não tenham funcionado. Os pesquisadores apenas as levaram em consideração para separá-las e medir o efeito do uso de máscaras isoladamente.
 "Como os custos econômicos do uso de máscara são próximos de zero quando comparados a outras medidas sanitárias, elas parecem ser uma maneira de bom custo-benefício para combater a Covid-19", afirmam.
 Uma das poucas limitações do estudo que os autores apontam é que a pesquisa se limitou à realidade da Alemanha, que tem uma taxa de adesão à lei acima da média e possui estrutura razoável de fiscalização. Dada a evidência extremamente favorável à eficácia da obrigatoriedade, os cientistas sugerem que se busque medir seu efeito em outros países que tenham tomado medidas semelhantes.

The housing activist organization Front d'action populaire en réaménagement urbain (FRAPRU) opposes the evictions. It claims that homeless camps have been around for years and will continue to be present in the city as long as Montreal fails to deal with the housing crisis.
 FRAPRU points to an Oct. 6 announcement by the federal minister of families, children and social development, Ahmed Hussen, as well as Quebec ministers Andrée Laforest and Sonia LeBel, to release $3.7 billion over 10 years to improve social and affordable housing.
 When the Canada-Quebec agreement was announced, LeBel, minister responsible for Canadian relations and the Canadian Francophonie, signalled that Quebec reserved the right to review all projects, therefore, that Quebec would select its priorities and that the government of Canada should then invest accordingly.
 FRAPRU spokesperson Véronique Laflamme accuses the government of Quebec of not doing enough to fulfill its electoral promise to deliver all of the 15,000 social housing units announced by the previous government. She reports that for two years, only 2,500 units have been built or are in the process of being built.

Unfortunately for bluebird bio and its investors, while the science behind its products may be sound, the manufacturing capacity is not. In early November, the FDA asked bluebird to prove its commercial manufacturing of a new treatment for sickle cell disease will match the manufacturing process from clinical trials. This was a huge setback for the company, as pandemic-related delays mean it likely won't be able to submit for FDA approval until 2022 -- but investors shouldn't be distracted by short-term problems. In the long run, bluebird bio is positioned for success. The company received priority review from the FDA for its multiple myeloma drug ide-cel, and bluebird will still be able to market its sickle cell disease treatment in Europe under the name Zynteglo as a treatment for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Bluebird bio shares are down nearly 50% year to date, but all is not lost for this gene therapy company, and investors looking for a value pick in this space may want to take a closer look.

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s governor is again telling lawmakers that he won’t call a special session to overturn Georgia’s election results and appoint 16 presidential electors who would support Republican President Donald Trump instead of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.Republican Gov. Brian Kemp issued a joint statement Sunday with Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, saying it would violate state law for the General Assembly to name electors instead of following the current state law that calls for the governor to certify electors after results are certified.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the Nov. 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” the two said in their statement.Trump and Kemp spoke by phone hours before Trump held a rally on Saturday in Valdosta. The president asked Kemp to order the legislative session and the governor refused. According to a tweet from the governor, Trump also asked him to order an audit of absentee ballots from the presidential race in his state. Kemp has said he can’t do that because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.Trump on Sunday tweeted more unproved allegations that Georgia’s election was fraudulent, blaming Kemp and Duncan for inaction.“Has anyone informed the so- called (says he has no power to do anything!) Governor @BrianKempGA &amp; his puppet Lt. Governor @GeoffDuncanGA, that they could easily solve this mess, &amp; WIN. Signature verification &amp; call a Special Session. So easy!”Duncan and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger appeared on television Sunday to defend the integrity of the election.“I’m proud that we’re able to look up after three recounts and watch and be able to see that this election was fair,” Duncan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Was it perfect? Absolutely not. I don’t know if any election was perfect in the history of this country.”“Right now, we don’t see anything that would overturn the will of the people here in Georgia,” Raffensperger said on ABC.Gabriel Sterling, who’s in charge of implementing Georgia’s voting system, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Trump is inciting unrest.“The president’s statements are false. They’re disinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters. And hell, I voted for him. The situation’s getting much worse and it’s an environment that’s been built out over years,” Sterling said.State lawmakers could call a special session on their own, but only if 60% of members in both houses of the General Assembly demanded a session in writing. That’s unlikely, especially because more than 40% of the current members of the state House are Democrats.On Saturday, four Republican state senators including William Ligon of Brunswick, Greg Dolezal of Cumming, Brandon Beach of Alpharetta and Burt Jones of Jackson launched a written petition trying to collect the signatures to force a special session. All four attended Trump’s rally Saturday in Valdosta.“I don’t believe that there’s the will in the General Assembly for a special session,” Raffensperger said. He said if lawmakers went ahead “they would be then nullifying the will of the people.”Kemp and Duncan said that going to court is “the only viable — and quickest option” for people challenging the results of Georgia’s presidential balloting.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

He commented that he felt like James Rodriguez hasn’t been doing enough from a creative point of view for Everton in recent weeks, and he opined that one of the reasons this might be the case is because the 29-year-old might not have expected it to have been as cold as it is in England.
 He said: “I feel like James as well, it’s got cold, hasn’t it? He’s probably thinking ‘I didn’t know it was this cold in England’. He’s not getting the time on the ball he was in the first few games, and I think he’s getting a bit found out to be honest.”
 "He’s not really offering the team what he should be and I think if Everton had a few more quality players on the bench, then I am sure James wouldn’t have been starting because he’s not really done much in these past few games. His body language is a bit, like, he throws his arms in the air if someone doesn’t pass to him and his work rate is non-existent."
 Of all the criticism that could be directed towards this current Everton side, singling out Rodriguez seems a bizarre choice. Worst yet, his comments look to lack any sort of evidence.
 If you were to look at assists alone as a form of chance creation, then yes, there’s a case to argue that the 29-year-old hasn’t been as influential as he was at the start of the season. This is because he is without an assist since the Merseyside Derby back in October.
 However, assessing the creative prowess of a player solely on assists in 2020 seems a very much outdated process. This is because the key issue with doing so is that the players making the passes are relying on the finishing capabilities of the recipient to be rewarded with any sort of credit.
 Take the below from Saturday’s fixture vs Burnley as a good example. In the closing moments of the match, Rodriguez picks the ball up on the edge of the Burnley penalty area and threads a pinpoint pass through the legs of a Clarets defender and into the path of Gylfi Sigurdsson inside the penalty area.

The Lord of the Rings Online MMO looks set to get a big update by 2022 in order to "capitalize" on the upcoming Amazon TV series.
 As _PCGamesN reports_, publisher Daybreak Game Company details plans for its game line-up in an _EG7 investor briefing_ presentation. On slide 19, there's a timeline listing "opportunities for growth." Under 2022, the slide details planned visual and technical updates for Lord of the Rings Online "for PC and next-gen consoles to capitalize on Amazon's highly publicized large investment" in the upcoming _Lord of the Rings TV show_.
 Originally released in 2007 for PC, the presentation seemingly confirms the MMO will be headed to the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S sometime in the future along with the planned update. Interestingly, while not officially confirmed, another MMO set in JRR Tolkien's fantasy world is said to be in the works from Amazon. Detailed Game License Agreement documents seemingly revealed a beta is due to release sometime in 2022, but we still don't know very much about it.
 The upcoming Amazon TV series set in Middle Earth doesn't have a concrete release date just yet. Word is the show is expected to premiere sometime in 2021, but with restrictions imposed on production as a result of COVID, there is of course still a chance it will be pushed back. Reports indicate that Galadriel and Elrond will feature in the series, and Sauron may play a key role.
 Daedalic Entertainment is also bringing us another new Tolkien adventure with the upcoming _Lord of the Rings: Gollum game_. Set to release on PC and consoles (including PS5 and Xbox Series X), the game takes place prior to the events of The Lord of the Rings, just after Gollum acquires the one ring.

“The best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our — or at least what used to be our — allies on the same page,” Biden told Friedman. “It’s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.”
 Jake Sullivan, the incoming national security advisor, is considering expanding the China team inside the White House National Security Council, to underscore that the issue is a foreign policy priority and that Biden wants to work with allies, according to a person close to the president-elect’s team. Also, because the White House advisors, like Sullivan, would not require Senate approval, Biden could avoid confirmation fights with Republicans who might control the chamber when he takes office.
 Hammering out his own trade strategy will prove complicated. Obama was pushing to ratify the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the free-trade agreement that would have linked the United States with other Pacific-fronting countries while leaving out China. The deal was on life support, however, even before Trump took office because of opposition from some Democrats and unions as well as Republicans.
 Now China has reached its own trade deal, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, with many of those same countries, leaving the United States on the sidelines.

When Joe Biden left the vice president’s office four years ago, the United States was a champion of the Paris climate accord, the architect of the multinational Iran nuclear deal and the leader of a 12-nation free-trade pact in the Pacific Rim region intended to limit China’s growing influence.
 None of those things is true anymore as he prepares to be inaugurated as commander in chief next month.
 Even as he will be preoccupied by the deadly coronavirus crisis at home, Biden faces a daunting array of global challenges, frayed alliances and emboldened adversaries. And he must confront these issues even as the country he’s set to lead has increasingly become skeptical of interventionism and a robust leadership role internationally — especially after President Trump’s inward- looking “America first” approach.
 “As much as there are a lot of people who just want to say, ‘We’re back,’ you can’t erase the last four years.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A proposed COVID-19 relief bill is expected to get backing from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell but it won’t include $1,200 in direct payments to most Americans, a Republican senator involved in the bipartisan talks says.“President Trump has indicated that he would sign a $908 billion package — there’s only one $908 billion package out there and it’s ours,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Sunday. “The pain of the American people is driving this, and I’m optimistic that both those leaders will come on board.”With time running out, lawmakers from both parties were closing in on the final language that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefits, leaving the issue of cash payments for President-elect Joe Biden to wrestle over with a new Congress next year.The package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.The direct payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.“The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion, to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by McConnell, R-Ky.Cassidy agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”The proposal is expected to include the $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.Still, potential sticking points remain.Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was “immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and “his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.“Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”Manchin said Biden’s team, when in power, “can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Founded by Emmanuelle Charpentier, one of the co-discoverers of CRISPR technology and co-recipient of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Crispr Therapeutics has a slew of therapies in the works. The company's main focus at the moment is CTX001, which treats patients with sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Another candidate in its pipeline is CTX110, a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which just enjoyed positive early results in its Phase 1 trial in late October. These are just two candidates among many that Crispr is working on, and any one of them could be incredibly profitable for the biotech company -- and its shareholders.

The Indian National Lok Dal on Monday extended its support to the 'Bharat Bandh' on December 8 called by farmer unions which have been protesting at the Delhi borders against the new central agri-marketing laws.
 Abhay Singh Chautala said his party had announced its support to the protesting farmers the day the agitation started, adding that "each and every worker of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) will fight this battle shoulder- to-shoulder to strengthen this movement so that the Centre is forced to abolish the three black laws imposed on the peasants".
 "Our party has decided to extend full support to the Bharat Bandh," he said.
 Chautala, younger son of INLD president and former chief minister OP Chautala, said he will visit the Tikri border on December 9 and meet the farmers and leaders leading the stir.
   
   
 In a statement here, the INLD leader said no farmer organisation of the country had demanded the new agricultural laws, but the central government enacted the "black farm legislations to benefit the corporates".
 He reiterated his demand that the Centre withdraw these laws and guarantee minimum support price (MSP) of crops to farmers, and also make provisions of punishment for whoever buys the crop below the MSP.
 Chautala also appealed to all political parties that they should rise above party politics and stand with farmers to lend strength to the agitation.
 At a press conference here last week, Chautala had asked the Centre to immediately accept farmers demand to repeal the three farm laws, and asserted that the party was "solidly behind the farmers fighting against the three laws".
 Claiming that their agitation has spread across the nation, farmer leaders, who have maintained that their protest is apolitical, have welcomed the support and urged all to come forward to make Bharat Bandh a success.
 After five rounds of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions failed to end the impasse, the two sides are again set to meet on December 9, a day after the countrywide strike.
 The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.
 However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.
 The Centre, however, has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

With the increasing advancement of technology across the world and in India, coding is not just any other subject, but it is a method of mental development. Students develop long computational thinking and algorithmic intelligence and are able to break down a problem in a structured form by using art, design, and other creative techniques through coding. In today's time, coding is the most discussed and developing idea. In the view of teachers, experts, and parents, coding is important for children, preferably at an earlier age. Nowadays, most private schools have coding as a mandatory subject. While government educational institutions across the country are working their way out to come at par with the private schools and institutions, the Delhi government has been proactive in revolutionising education in its schools. Keeping in mind the importance of coding and the ongoing focus on the subject, the Delhi government has introduced HT Codeathon for government school students.During their second term in 2015, the Delhi government, under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, focussed its reforms to improve and modernise the existing education system. The education department of the Delhi government, under education minister Manish Sisodia, began developing from the scratch the educational infrastructure in the national capital. Starting with making new school buildings, establishing world-class schools of excellence, state of the art classrooms, swimming pools and gyms, the Delhi government transformed the old, rickety condition of the educational infrastructure under the state government. With time, the Delhi government also realised that for the development of the education system, upgradation of the infrastructure would not be enough. Education minister Sisodia began brainstorming with experts and introduce innovative elements such as happiness curriculum and entrepreneurship curriculum. The Delhi government also focused and developed student-teacher parents' interactions with the concept of mega PTMs. Smart education is the key to envision a smart future. Cultivating coding skills among school going students is essential to developing a problem-solving approach and ultimately imparting more algorithmic thinking to make complex problems easier. To promote critical thinking among students, the Delhi government has launched various initiatives to disseminate the language of coding among students. A similar, one-of-its kind initiative is She Codes, which involves building a strong foundation of learning coding and tech skills among girl students in Delhi government schools.The Delhi government partnered with She Codes in January. The idea was to build up coding and programming skills in the girl students. The first phase of the partnership was envisioned, where around 1000 girl students of Class 6 in the Delhi government schools were taught coding. Apart from imparting the specific coding skills, the aim was also to build algorithmic logical thinking in the students. During the pandemic, the focus of the programme shifted from coding to animation, which was taught remotely. In the last couple of months, the students have created animated videos, delivering a wide range of social messages on their YouTube personal channels. In the second phase, these students will be specifically taught programming.Recently, the Delhi government has partnered with HT Codeathon, through which the government is targeting to teach coding to the students of the Delhi government schools. During a recent interaction with students and teachers on the progress of the HT Codeathon sessions, Sisodia, while lauding the efforts and achievements of the students, said, "It is my dream to see our students create their own companies like Google, and watch them take it worldwide. Coding is giving these students the wings to fly from an early schooling stage."Under the HT Codeathon programme, 13.461 students from about 1,000 Delhi government schools are being trained in coding and programming skills. 2,567 students have completed all five chapters till date. Chief minister Kejriwal applauded the Codeathon initiative. "Being a trained engineer from the IIT, I have always realised the importance of technology and the scientific minds and methods. Childhood and school education are the most important parts of any person's life. Just the way charity begins at home, the basic learning of even the most complex subjects should begin from the very childhood. The Delhi government's initiative of teaching coding to the children will not only open a new door of their learning but also create an example in front of the world that the government schools can also dream big and make it happen," he said.

ATLANTA — Even after he exits the White House, President Donald Trump’s efforts to challenge the legitimacy of the election and seeking to overturn the will of voters could have staying power.
 Trump’s tactics are already inspiring other candidates and have been embraced by a wide array of Republicans. Supporters include congressional candidates, state lawmakers, party chairs, conservative legal groups and appointees to previously little-known state vote-certification boards. The breadth of support for Trump’s effort could be a troubling sign for future elections.
 “What this president is doing is poisoning democracy,” former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm said. “And, yes, he is setting a precedent, suggesting that it is OK to violate these norms that have made our country great.”
 Granholm, a Democrat, joined with former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, to raise concerns about Trump’s refusal to concede and efforts to undermine the integrity of elections.
 “This is not who we are as Americans, and we don’t want the public coming away from this thinking this is the norm,” said Whitman, who served in President George W. Bush’s administration.
 Trump and his allies have pushed conspiracies involving voting machines manipulated by dead foreign leaders and tens of thousands of fraudulent mail ballots that somehow escaped layers of security and scrutiny by election workers across the country. They have filed lawsuits without evidence, tried to pressure state lawmakers into seating their own presidential electors and sought to influence low-level party members who sit on the state and local boards that certify election results.
 This is despite the fact that the federal government’s own cybersecurity arm declared the presidential election “the most secure in American history,” and Attorney General William Barr said the Department of Justice uncovered no evidence that would change the outcome.
 Even so, Trump has found friendly lawmakers and party officials willing to bolster his claims and adopt his tactics. On Friday, a group of 64 GOP lawmakers in Pennsylvania signed a statement urging Congress not to accept the state’s slate of electors for Democrat Joe Biden. They cited a litany of complaints over how the election was conducted.
 “A number of people have shown themselves willing to go along or at least being perceived of going along instead of just condemning the entire operation,” said Wendy Weiser with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. “It was not written off as it should have been.”
 In recent days, lawmakers in battleground states have provided friendly forums for Trump allies to air their suspicions. A group of GOP state lawmakers in Arizona held an unofficial meeting where Trump’s lawyers repeated claims of irregularities with the state’s vote count but provided no evidence of widespread fraud. The chairwoman of the Arizona GOP asked a court to overturn Biden’s win in the state.
 The effort then shifted to Michigan, where Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani appeared at a four-hour legislative hearing to argue that fraud had occurred.
 “Throughout this hearing, my colleagues continued to speak in circles about ‘getting to the bottom of this.’ But we’re already at the bottom, and there’s nothing down here,” said Michigan state Rep. Darrin Camilleri, a Democrat. “Down here at the bottom of all this, it’s just a dark, empty place.”
 On Thursday, a legislative committee in Georgia received testimony from a Trump campaign attorney about purported irregularities despite a hand count and machine audit that revealed no major problems with the vote.
 Election law experts say time will tell whether Trump’s approach and the support it has generated in the GOP represent a shift in how candidates handle defeat.
 “Next time could be worse,” constitutional law expert Edward B. Foley warned in an op-ed last week while offering praise for the few Republicans willing to stand up to Trump.
 Those included Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who certified his state’s election amid calls for his resignation from fellow Republicans and threats, and Aaron Van Langevelde, one of two Republicans on the Michigan board that certified that state’s results.
 While the other Republican on the Michigan board abstained, Van Langevelde said he was required under state law to certify Biden’s win. The result, Foley noted, could have easily been different if other Republicans more open to Trump’s arguments had occupied those same positions.
 “What makes this year’s narrow escape so unnerving is how far the plot to overthrow the election got with so little factual ammunition,” Foley said.
 Others believe Trump’s behavior is more of a fluke and unlikely to result in any lasting damage to the electoral process.
 “Everybody knows that it’s just because they lost,” said Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat. “There isn’t anyone from the president on down that genuinely believed that there was any real fraud. That’s what makes it so disingenuous.”
 A few candidates have followed Trump’s lead, refusing to concede and seeking extraordinary measures to address their concerns.
 A Pennsylvania congressional candidate who lost his race has yet to concede and signed on to a lawsuit challenging the validity of all mail ballots cast this year. A Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan called on the state to take the unprecedented step of delaying certification so an audit could be done — despite an extensive county canvassing process that did not find significant irregularities. He ultimately conceded.
 Using the 2020 election as a springboard to create more trust in the process would help, said David Carroll, head of the democracy program at the Carter Center, founded by former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn.
 That could involve requiring state and local election officials to be nonpartisan and appointed rather than elected by party, clarifying vague election laws, implementing federal standards for parts of the process and ensuring more training for election workers and volunteers.
 “There was a lot of discussion before the election that the process might not be credible. Those are the things we see around the world where democracy is weak,” Carroll said. “It will be important for us to sit down as a nation and as a society and say we don’t want this to happen again. If we don’t, it’s likely that it could.”
 Trump’s strategy, even if it fails, will probably still be an effective rallying tool for supporters, and it has generated at least $170 million in donations since Election Day. As Trump hints at running for president again, he will need his supporters to stay energized and on his side.
 “I don’t think it’s going to go away,” said Democratic California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, “because I don’t think he is going away.”

From his studies of Mexican folk art, as well his understanding of folk art in the US, he recognized that the survival of a tradition within this genre of art was largely dependent on the makers’ ability to sustain a living. His insistence on paying cash instead of taking items on consignment helps the artists survive from their work and encourages them to produce the highest quality works of art. One of the wonderful things about Mexican folk art is that it is still reasonably priced. Some of the work is so exquisitely crafted and decorated that it could easily qualify as fine art, but they are still priced as folk art, making it possible to own a museum-quality piece by a great master. For Shacter, high quality became the standard by which he wanted his gallery to be known, forging a paradigm for others to aspire.

Motivul trecerii în plan secund a rezultatelor e simplu. M-a preocupat prezența la vot. S-a spus că prezența va depinde de atmosfera de Pandemie. O nerozie. Localele au arătat că românii nu se tem de Pandemie. Românii se tem de milițienii care, veniți în București de la coada vacii, au orgasme de plăcere să se dea mari și cu bulan. Și forma de grandomanie a prostului e puterea de a sancționa. Românii se tem de sancțiuni. Când li se dă voie să zburde prin carantină, o fac. Așa s-a întâmplat în 6 decembrie 2020. Cei care au vrut să meargă la vot au mers. Prin urmare, prezența a fost anul acesta, ca și în 2016 anul celei mai proaste prezențe din postdecembrism, dependentă de voința de a merge la urne. O prezență mică a dat seama de o lipsă de entuziasm de mobilizare, de motiv de a merge la vot. Erau toate premisele pentru aceasta din punctul de vedere al tradițiilor postdecembriste. Oricât s-a străduit Klaus Iohannis să-i convingă pe români, aceștia din urmă n-au mai perceput PSD drept Monstrul, drept Ciuma Roșie. Ura față de PSD s-a consumat în trei rânduri de alegeri – europarlamentare, prezidențiale, locale. În plus, la Guvernare se află, de un an, alt partid decât PSD. PNL a guvernat catastrofal. Nu doar ca administrator, al țării, dar și ca pretendent la ipostaza de făcător de Altfel de Politică. Era greu de crezut că va stârni entuziasmul care împinge lumea să iasă la vot. USR PLUS putea cere acest entuziasm. USRPLUS a căzut însă în capcana Fripturii duse pe la nas de Klaus Iohannis. După ce președintele i-a anunțat pe Dacian Cioloș și Dan Barna că PNL va împărți cu USR PLUS puterea, Alianța a tras pe dreapta și a pus de un somn de ghiftuit în vis. Reducerea motoarelor anti-PNL a făcut ca antipatia față de PNL să nu mai meargă masiv în voturile USRPLUS. Că prezența slabă, cea mai slabă din postdecembrism, se explică prin absența imboldului de a merge la vot, ne-o arată incredibila victorie a AUR. Partid necunoscut până mai ieri, AUR a devenit, după aceste alegeri, cea de-a patra forță politică a țării. Explicația e dată de imboldul dat de AUR alegătorilor săi de a merge la vot. Iată că alegătorii AUR nu s-au temut de Pandemie.

She creates one-of-a-kind figurative pieces and has a production line of magnets and plates that she sells. Her husband, Tiger, helps with the production line, which is their main source of income. Their work is sold largely through Weibo, which is likened to Twitter, but has many more functions. Previously she had worked in Hangzhou as a fashion designer, but needed two jobs to make ends meet and had no time to create her own work. Moving to Jingdezhen, she has been able to learn ceramic techniques from peers and adapt the aesthetic she developed as a fashion designer to apply to clay. She says she values the strong sense of community among the ceramic artists who help her with the technical aspects of working in clay.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran says it is glad the United States “got the message” and modified its behavior in the Persian Gulf. The remarks by a spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry came after the top U.S. Navy official in the region said his forces had reached a state of “uneasy deterrence” with Iran after months of regional attacks and seizures at sea. Tensions remain high over Iran’s nuclear program after President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal and imposed heavy sanctions on Iran. The U.S. Navy routinely has tense encounters with Iran's Revolutionary Guard in the Persian Gulf.

I understand the fact that you can bring a much bigger profit if you cut down on costs of materials, but that could hurt your company in the long run. Once you start producing lower quality products, there is a possibility that your customers will be disappointed with your product and will ultimately switch to a different company.

Thunder Bay city council is looking at tightening rules around fireworks after noise complaints following Canada Day last summer.
 Coun. Aldo Ruberto brought the motion forward in July because of “numerous complaints about fireworks going off at all hours of the night three days prior to an event.”
 Ruberto cited the city’s bylaw saying that fireworks can be set off three days prior to events like new years, and he added that it looks like people can go all night despite the 12:30 a.m. noise bylaw.
 Council looked at eliminating New Year’s Day, Civic Holiday and Labour Day and allowing the use of fireworks only on the named-day and removing the previously allowed three days prior.
 They were also looking at including a weather delay exemption and increasing fines to the maximum permitted amount.
 Ruberto said he would like to bring a motion to council to look at having authorized dealers handle the sale of fireworks. Ruberto said there are now only two businesses that are trained and certified in regards to fireworks and safe handling, in contrast to fireworks being sold from virtually any retail setting.
 “I have had people call me saying the neighbours set off fireworks and it caught their siding on fire,” said Ruberto, citing the need to be safe when using fireworks.
 Doug Vincent, manager of licensing and enforcement, said that bylaw enforcement officers are not available during the evening hours but they have other options of enforcement like using fines as a deterrent.
