Watts has dropped a lot of outrageous remarks, but this is beyond the pale. Her “woke” awareness is leaving her blind to the rampant lawlessness plaguing urban communities and instead of following misguided and vindictive policies perpetuated by politicians chasing after “Defund the Police” demands. Left in the wake are cries of citizens left vulnerable to the cruel and heartless criminals running rampant.

LONDON (AP) — In the end, Sir Tom didn’t need to rise.On a day infused with emotion, Queen Elizabeth II tapped the blade of a sword once owned by her father on the slender shoulders of 100-year-old Tom Moore, making a hero of a nation a knight of the realm Friday.Moore captivated the British public by walking 100 laps of his garden in England and raising some 33 million pounds ($40 million) for the National Health Service in April. The queen knighted him with the traditional sword tap, but the World War II veteran was not required to take a knee before the monarch.Instead, Moore steadied himself against his now-famous walker and wheeled himself across the grass to stand in front of Elizabeth.“I have been overwhelmed by the many honours I have received over the past weeks, but there is simply nothing that can compare to this,‘' he tweeted after the ceremony. “I am overwhelmed with pride and joy.”The ceremony was staged outside of Windsor Castle west of London, where the 94-year old queen has been sheltering during the COVID-19 pandemic alongside her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh.Moore, who rose to the rank of captain while serving in India and Burma during the war, revealed that he and Elizabeth spoke about ages - slightly breaking the protocol of not revealing a private conversation with the queen.“She did mention I’m 100, and I said to her, ‘Well, you’ve a long way to go yet,’ so she’s alright,” he said.Moore walked into the nation’s hearts by setting a goal of marking his 100th birthday with a garden lap for each year of his life.His family elevated the challenge by using social media and the motto #TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay to seek donations to support health care workers during the pandemic, in part a show of gratitude for the doctors and nurses who took care of Moore when he broke his hip last year.He dreamed of raising 1,000 pounds. Instead, he raised so much more.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On a day when Tamil Nadu recorded its highest-ever daily death toll due to COVID-19 so far, the State government on Friday reviewed the prevailing situation and instructed District Collectors to go for focused intervention such as ganising fever camps. The Collectors were also told to boost health infrastructure and recruit adequate medical staff.
 Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam chaired a videoconference of District Collectors at the Secretariat and reviewed the status of COVID-19 cases and the steps being taken in each district to contain the spread. “The Chief Secretary asked us to map the disease spread and go for focused interventions like fever camps and awareness-building exercises, clear the backlog in obtaining results and take care of health infrastructure. By and large, the Collectors are focused [on the issue], and the number [of cases] is expected to come down in a few days,” a senior official who was present at the meeting told _The Hindu._
 The Chief Secretary instructed the Collectors to carry out “adequate testing”, i.e., 10 times the average case load. “If the [number of] positive cases were 100 the previous day in a specific district, he advised the Collector concerned to test at least 1,000 samples the following day,” the official said. Another officer said the Collectors were instructed to look at ways to exercise better control over containment zones and in the buffer areas to curtail the spread and distribute immunity-boosting products in these areas, besides improving enforcement in market areas and crowded spaces.

As one enters the retirement period, a smart allocation of assets is needed to enjoy a regular stream of income. Earlier, a rule of thumb was followed by the retirement corpus, which said that the stock part of one’s portfolio should equal 100 minus the retiree’s age. For example, if an investor retires at 60, 40% of his total savings would go to stocks and the rest to bonds.

I was thus pleased to learn that the title of the new album is also the title of an Italian poem by Eugenio Montale, a poem that Carter used for a song cycle scored for soprano and instrumental ensemble. Montale's phenomenology is orthogonal to Eliot's, so there should be no surprise that it can be applied to different periods of music history.

(Adnkronos) - Gli ultimi 40 cm sono stati quelli più complicati. Ora, il Comandante Carrolo, se la sente di tracciare un bilancio su quanto accaduto negli ultimi due giorni. "E' stata dura, sì - ammette in una intervista all'Adnkronos - Sono arrivato subito dopo su un mezzo anfibio per capire la situazione. Decine di persone in difficoltà e noi ci siamo messi subito al lavoro. E' stata una grande fatica". Ma qual è stato il momento più difficile? "Quando si era sparsa la voce di due possibili vittime - dice Carrolo - una persona ha detto di avere visti una coppia andare a fondo sulla loro auto. Sono stati momenti molto complicati. Poi, per fortuna si è rivelata una fake news. Non ci sono state vittime". "Voglio ringraziare tutti i vigili del fuoco - dice Carrolo per il contributo che hanno dato a testa bassa per garantire un servizio ai cittadini in difficoltà, ma anche la Protezione civile sia comunale che regionale e l'esercito. C'è stata una sinergia istituzionale importante". "A regime hanno lavorato 5 pompe idrovore ad alta portata senza mai interrompere il loro funzionamento", dice ancora Carrolo, Ma nel frattempo sono arrivate almeno "mille telefonate di cittadini preoccupati" per gli allagamenti di garage, abitazioni, campagne. Adesso la situazione è tornata quasi alla normalità. E già nelle prossime ore dovrebbe riaprire la carreggiata della circonvallazione rimasta chiusa per due giorni. (di Elvira Terranova)
