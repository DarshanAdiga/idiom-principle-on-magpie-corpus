“It’s just a dream. I’ve come full circle,” he said, standing behind a podium draped with dark blue bunting that bore the Princeton Rays’ logo.
 “I am proud, very proud, to be the first inductee into the Appalachian League Hall of Fame representing the Princeton franchise,” Holland said.
 “Today is indeed a great day to celebrate the 32-year history of baseball in this town,” he said. “Today is all about Princeton.”
 Holland served as Princeton GM from November 1991 to early 2016. For the first five seasons, the club was affiliated with the Cincinnati Reds, then in 1997 became an affiliate of the brand new Tampa Bay Rays franchise. Princeton’s only Appalachian League championship came in 1994.
 A native of the town of Dunbar in the Kanawha Valley, Holland arrived in Princeton after a couple of years working for the Appy League’s now-defunct Huntington franchise.
 He hit the ground running. For the next 24 summers, Princeton professional baseball had a promotion, giveaway or “special night” at every home game played. Holland worked continually on stadium renovations, community outreach, directing a corps of volunteers and part-time employees, and balancing the shoestring budget of a rookie-level baseball franchise.
 In 1993, Holland was named the Appy League’s Executive of the Year. He is the only five-time winner of the league’s Award of Promotional Excellence. He was the circuit’s corporate secretary from 2002 to 2012 and was presented the Appalachian League President’s Award in 2015 for “his long-term service to the game.”
 The Rotary Club of Princeton chose him as the 1998 recipient of its Service Above Self award, and in 2012 the Princeton-Mercer County Chamber of Commerce named him its Citizen of the Year.
 During his talk on Monday, Holland singled out two additional accomplishments of his tenure in town.
 He and Bluefield GM George McGonagle established the Mercer Cup competition in 1992, which has since been nationally recognized. A large trophy goes each summer to the team winning the head-to-head series between the Princeton and Bluefield franchises.

The race became extremely bitter, with candidates making accusations of nepotism, killing of pets, destruction of campaign signs, vicious online bullying and misogyny, fabricating high school sports achievements, educational degrees and career background.
 Massie won the election on June 9 but has not accepted the position.
 His victory meant that the Raleigh County Chief Circuit Court judge must, under state code, appoint a temporary magistrate immediately or wait until after Jan. 1, 2021, to appoint a permanent magistrate.
 Due to JIC proceedings, the appointment process has been slowed.
 Chief Raleigh Circuit Judge Andrew Dimlich reported earlier this month that, until the West Virginia Supreme Court formally accepts Massie’s agreement with JIC, the terms are not binding — meaning that Massie could, theoretically, accept the magistrate position he won.
 On Monday, there was not a set date for when the State Supreme Court would accept Massie’s agreement, West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals Clerk Ancil Ramey said.
 Raleigh Circuit judges are waiting on the West Virginia Supreme Court to approve the agreement and have not yet taken steps to appoint a temporary magistrate or a permanent magistrate, Dimlich said.
 The appointee does not have to be a Division 2 candidate.
 Dimlich said Monday that he has asked the State Supreme Court if the District 2 race may be placed on the upcoming November 2020 ballot. If another election is permissible, any candidate – meeting filing qualifications – may be placed on the ballot, he reported.
 He said he had not received a reply on the November election question by Monday evening.

" _Black Lives Matter community organizers in Rochester find it appalling that Monroe County faith leaders and law enforcement have taken another step towards division and authoritarianism. The police and faith leaders have failed miserably at an attempt to represent unity in our community. They excluded all other community organizations from this collaboration under the guise of unity. The have totally bamboozled Rochester residents. The formation of MCATCP (Monroe County Alliance for Transformation of Community and Police) without consulting any of the local Black Lives Matter community organizers is a slap in the face to the organizers. It is a slap in the face to the thousands of hardworking Rochester residents who have come together at MLK park for four consecutive weekends to denounce racism and police brutality._..We hope that MCATCP will do the right thing and get in touch with community organizers immediately."

The daily number of new confirmed cases in the United States has surged over the past week. The U.S. has the world's worst coronavirus outbreak, with nearly 2.6 million people confirmed infected and over 126,000 dead, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that experts say understates the pandemic's true toll due to limited testing and other reasons.
