Jumlisse, who worked 12 years as a licensed practical nurse and registered nurse in the United States before moving back to Haiti in 2010, and the medical staff at Mirebalais have been dreading a tide in the deadly infections that they know is coming, and that the Pan American Health Organization warns could overwhelm an already weak health system.
 In just one week, the number of confirmed infections of COVID-19, the disease caused by the flu-like virus, had more than doubled in Haiti. They increased from 123 laboratory-confirmed cases on March 8 to 310 as of Friday. By Saturday, the number had jumped by an additional 48 cases and by Sunday, the number of confirmed infections stood at 456. Of that total, 20 people have died — four of them at Mirebalais.
 While the spike in positive cases has yet to translate into a deluge of sick people at Mirebalais’ wrought-iron gates, things are starting to get critical.
 Several directors of private hospitals in recent days reported an increase in patients showing a range of severe symptoms that are the markings of the virus: respiratory problems, coughing, an acute fever. The government’s water agency reported the death of a driver from the coronavirus, and confirmed that several employees had been tested and were in self-isolation.
 The director of the country’s prison system, while pushing back rumors that the virus had hit his overcrowded prison population, acknowledged that there was a rapidly spreading fever inside the National Penitentiary. On Thursday, residents in the coastal town of Arcahaie, 30 miles north of the capital, protested after hearing that 75 inmates at the prison in the middle of town had been moved to make room for eventual COVID-19 prisoners.
 And on Friday, the medical director of Port-au-Prince’s St. Luke Hospital, a private nonprofit that only recently began receiving COVID-19 patients, acknowledged that 11 patients suspected of having the disease had died since Sunday, within three to four hours of arriving at the facility. Dr. Marc Edison Augustin also said with infected patients desperately in need of life- saving oxygen, the hospital was running low on stock.
 The staff at Mirebalais, which is two hours from Port-au-Prince through the mountains of central Haiti, say they are also seeing an increase in the number of suspected COVID-19 patients who are critical, and know it’s just a matter of days before they, too, face tougher decisions.
 “What’s going through our heads is, ‘Get it ready,’” Jumlisse said. “How many beds do we have, how many can we get prepared? How many staff … how many people can we train now?”
 With patients continuing to come for regular medical care, resources are being stretched thin.
 With a background in emergency response and public health, Jumlisse, wonders if she’s taking her best nurses away from other critical patients in the intensive care unit to put them in the COVID-19 treatment center, where an initial fear from health care workers to be assigned there has now turned into a raise of hands.
 Loune Viaud, the executive director of Zanmi Lasante, the Haitian nongovernmental organization that operates the hospital along with its U.S. partner, Boston-based Partners In Health, also worries.
 Hundreds continue to show up daily, traveling six hours or more on public buses and on the back of motorcycles to sleep in the hospital’s parking lot in order to secure a place in line at first light to see a doctor.
 “Every night when I go to sleep, I am thinking I am going to wake up and hear that the cases have spiked and they are going to send us more patients,” said Viaud, who is also running COVID-19 sites in St. Marc, Hinche and Belladère and has a team doing rapid testing at the Belladère crossing at the Haiti- Dominican Republic border.
 According to Dominican immigration officials, 25,000 Haitians have returned to Haiti since the start of the pandemic, deepening fears of rapid community transmission given the high number of infections in the Dominican Republic, where the health ministry reported 12,314 cases on Sunday and 428 coronavirus- related deaths.
 Haitians are crossing despite the official closure of the border. Last week alone, 1,321 Haitians crossed the official Belladère border in Haiti’s central plateau, according to the International Organization for Migration. There are at least 59 other crossings, all unofficial and unmonitored, in the same region.
 “I keep thinking, ‘What I am going to do when the cases start to increase, and for how long can we hold on?’” Viaud said.
 A nonprofit solar-powered teaching hospital, the University Hospital of Mirebalais is one of five officially designated COVID-19 hospitals in Haiti, where medical experts estimate they will need at least 9,000 hospital beds to combat the infection when it peaks.
 Combined, the hospitals have less than 300 beds devoted to individuals infected with COVID-19.
 Envisioned before Haiti’s devastating 2010 earthquake, the hospital’s $21 million construction was fast-tracked after the quake left more than 300,000 dead and the main government hospital was destroyed. Today, it is not just the country’s biggest operating hospital with its 300 beds but perhaps the best equipped to confront the global pandemic, even with just 17 beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients.
 Unlike other health care facilities, which depend on an oxygen dispensing site in a gang-controlled area of Port-au-Prince, Mirebalais’ ventilation system produces its own oxygen and uses cylinders as back ups if needed. One COVID-19 patient could use a minimum of two to three cylinders of oxygen a day.
 Between the time the hospital received the health ministry’s Feb. 7 request asking if it could help care for COVID-19 patients, and when it received the call on March 19 saying Haiti had two confirmed cases and they were en route, staff had just six weeks to transform the hospital’s grounds. Going into overdrive, they immediately started making preparations, doing so while managing threats from the neighboring community that they will burn the hospital if it were to open it doors to COVID patients.

"Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatising. It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks."
 The virus referred to in the abbreviation COVID-19 is actually known as SARS- Cov2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).
 And the reason these viruses are called coronaviruses to begin with is because of their appearance: under the microscope, they look like they are covered with pointed structures that surround them like a corona or crown.
 Their effect, however, ranges widely — from the common cold to severe respiratory illnesses.
 Here is a chronological list of notable viruses and how they were labelled.

For sure Bolsorano, Modi, Trump and Johnson -- what I term the 'Gang of Four' -- are unpleasant egotistical leaders, but does that make them 'fascists'? I think only time will tell, but at the moment one gets the sense is that each has become the leader due to a mixture of false pretenses, (social) media manipulation, populism, weakness/fragmentation of opposition parties and politics without any principles. To be fascists, in the truest sense, they would need to have significant popular support, both from the masses of ordinary working people from below and ruling elites from above. For a complex set of contradictory reasons, with some limited exceptions, neither of these constituencies favour them. Indeed, much of their 'popular' appeal is from precisely those who would suffer most from their policies.

Similarly, in the 1930s in Germany, following the Great Depression, which caused the economy to collapse and immense human suffering, and the failure of the established parties of the left and right, a path was cleared for Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist German Workers’ Party (NSDAP), more popularly know as the 'Nazi Party. Their promise was to create a “people’s community” (Volksgemeinschaft) that would overcome the country’s divisions. However, most critically, Hitler's reference to 'people' did not include minorities, most notably Jews, and other population groups that were termed “undesirables.” And it was this appeal to majoritarianism that led to the terrible crimes against humanity and the destruction of the country.
