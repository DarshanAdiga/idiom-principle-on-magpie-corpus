“Anything was better than how I’d been living – because I’d left it so long and made myself so ill, so I just accepted it.”
 But it has not been plain sailing, according to Bethany, who ended up in hospital after an incident at her 2019 work Christmas party.
 She said: “My stoma prolapsed, so my small intestine was coming out of my insides and into the bag.
 “I turned up to the hospital in a sequinned dress, feeling a little bit tipsy and the doctors had to manually put the intestine back inside me. I think being a bit merry helped in that situation!”

With so much going on right now, it’s easy to get lost in the moment.
 When we leave a store, we’re thinking about loading our car without contaminating interior surfaces with our hands that touched the shopping cart and surfaces inside the store. We then try to enter the car without touching anything inside it before we sanitize our hands, but also without touching anything outside after we’ve sanitized. While juggling those tasks, we’re thinking about our next steps, like where we’ll find the toilet paper the store we left didn’t have.
 We’re preoccupied, to say the least. That preoccupation got the better of a Walmart shopper last month. The woman mistakenly left her purse in a shopping cart after loading her car. She realized her mistake before getting out of the parking lot but it was too late. The purse was gone. Walmart’s security video shows who took it, but investigators need help identifying her.

My process almost always starts on the guitar. Once I find a chord progression or guitar part that I find interesting enough I'll start to put a melody over the top using gibberish lyrics, and that tends to lead to me fleshing out the full structure of the idea, music and melody. The tough bit for me is normally getting lyrics that I'm happy with, but that normally comes from noting down the gibberish I've been singing and latching on to a word in that and building out from there. It's amazing how much your subconscious often helps to tell you what a song is about before you know yourself.

Nearly 300 confirmed cases of coronavirus behind bars

There are now a total of 278 confirmed cases in 64 prisons as of 5pm on Sunday, according to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), and 13 inmates have died.Some 194 prison staff have also contracted the virus in 53 jails as well as eight prisoner escort and custody services staff.
 Some 700 staff have been tested and 6,268 were self-isolating, according to the latest available figures. Last week prison charities launched legal action against the Justice Secretary, claiming measures so far taken to address coronavirus behind bars are “unlawful” because they will have a “manifestly insufficient impact”.
 Lawyers acting for the Howard League for Penal Reform and Prison Reform Trust wrote to Robert Buckland with details of a proposed application for judicial review, should urgent action not be taken to address the concerns raised.
 This followed news there was an “outbreak” of the disease at HMP Wymott in
 Lancashire last week and inmates are being moved into single cells.The MoJ plans to build some 2,000 single-occupancy temporary prison cells in the grounds of seven jails in a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus, to be used by low-risk category C and D offenders.
 Self-isolating or symptomatic prisoners and those who have tested positive are put in a cell on their own, but those who have not displayed symptoms may still be sharing cells with other inmates.

The Higher Education Commission has quickly switched to online learning for the millions of students enrolled at private and public-sector universities around the country. On paper, this seems like a sensible plan given the Covid-19 pandemic and the havoc it has caused around the world, forcing places of work, universities, colleges and businesses to shut down. However, it has become obvious during the first month or so of the online system going into effect that a very large number of students are simply not able to keep up with classes. These include the many who have no access to high-speed internet, those who live in areas of the country including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan where wi-fi services are virtually non-existent and also the many who suffer from the periodic power shutdowns that have already begun with the arrival of the first signs of summer. Students have complained that when power disappears at random intervals, they are forced to switch to their mobile phones and data services, sometimes ripping through thousands of rupees within an hour.

Philadelphia-area grocers — including Giant, Acme, and Aldi — recently started limiting the number of shoppers allowed in their stores at the same time, to protect workers.
 Across the country, dozens of grocery clerks have been sickened with the virus. And a Trader Joe’s worker in Scarsdale, N.Y., a greeter at a Giant store in Largo, Md., and two Walmart employees from the same Chicago-area store have died from the coronavirus.
 Acknowledging how vulnerable essential workers are, Wolf announced new rules aimed at preventing the virus from spreading in businesses open to in-person customers. Grocery stores in the state must now make all workers and customers wear masks, and start taking employees’ temperatures if a coworker tests positive.
 But even as the state rolled out these new protections, it hasn’t done any more to ensure that the workers Wolf deemed essential are fairly compensated besides asking employers to step up and do the right thing. Wolf called fair pay for essential workers “the responsibility of the private sector.”
 Among the grocers that operate in the Philadelphia area, only Trader Joe’s and Whole Foods have offered bonuses or higher hourly wages to their workers since the coronavirus outbreak.

"Now we’re at a point where some of the upstate hospitals have significant financial burdens because they’re not doing the elective surgery, which is one of the places where they make money frankly," Cuomo said at the state Capitol.
 It was not immediately clear which regions would initially get the green light for resuming elective surgeries. However, rural regions of the state have had the lowest infection rates since the COVID-19 pandemic spread to New York in early March.
 In an interview with CNHI, Gary Fitzgerald, president of the Upstate New York Healthcare Coalition, called the governor's pivot on elective surgeries "encouraging." He noted over the weekend he presented the Cuomo administration with a "roadmap" spelling out how the hospitals could safely resume the procedures.
 Fitzgerald had explained to Cuomo that elective procedures could be resumed after the hospitals have three to four weeks to prepare for the surgeries such as cancer biopsies and joint replacements.
 In his letter to the governor, Fitzgerald pointed out planning for bringing back elective surgeries would address "COVID-19 related safety and risk mitigation surrounding a second wave" of infection, as well as the need for testing protocols and environmental cleaning at the hospitals.
 The planning would be based on guidance from the American Hospitals Association, the American College of Surgeons and other medical organizations, he noted.
 Hospitals that have furloughed medical staffers include Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center, Eastern Niagara Hospital in Lockport, Glens Falls Hospital, the University of Rochester Medical Center and St. Joseph's Health in Syracuse.
 Cuomo said the state's new policy for elective surgeries during the pandemic will address the need for "balance in the valve and the dial."
 "What happens if you have a need for those beds because of the coronavirus and you don't have the beds because someone is doing some form of elective surgery?" Cuomo said. "That's the balance."

NEW YORK — The world is awash in oil, there's little demand for it and we're running out of places to put it.
 That in a nutshell explains Monday's strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts, where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month.
 The price of U.S. benchmark crude that would be delivered in May was selling for around $15 a barrel Monday morning, but fell as low as -$40 per barrel during the day. It was the first time that the price on a futures contract for oil has gone negative, analysts say.

The Ministry of Agriculture issued an order on April 19, outlining that the farmers of Haor region can be given a subsidy of 70 percent on the purchase of farm machinery while farmers in other regions will receive a 50 percent subsidy.
 The Department of Agricultural Extension will have to spend the allocated funds in light of the relevant policies and financial regulations.
 No claim from the previous year can be adjusted from the amount and the department will have to spend the money after checking and confirming all the documents related to the subsidies on equipment, according to the order.
 The final audited account has to be submitted to the Finance Division to ensure that the subsidy has been paid following proper rules.
 The order also said the unspent money should be deposited to the government treasury by June 30.

RALEIGH, N.C. (Michael Hyland/WNCN) – An even larger crowd is expected in Raleigh Tuesday compared to last week to protest Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order, as protests occur in states across the country.Last week’s protest in Raleigh drew more than 100 people and ended when Raleigh police ordered them to leave, arresting one woman in the process.“I believe North Carolinians are extremely intelligent and could handle this given the chance without sacrificing their entire livelihood,” said Ashley Smith, co-founder of ReOpenNC.Over the weekend, attorney Anthony Biller sent a letter to Gov. Roy Cooper (D) and Greg Ford, chairman of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, calling on the two to put in writing that “protestors will not be detained, arrested, or prosecuted under their quarantine orders” as long as people adhere to social distancing.Biller works for Michael Best and Friedrich, a law firm headed by Reince Preibus, former White House Chief of Staff for President Donald Trump and former chairman of the Republican National Committee.On Monday, Biller gave CBS17 a copy of a letter he received from William McKinney, general counsel for Cooper.In the letter, McKinney writes that the governor’s executive orders do not ban outdoor protests.“Reports from your clients’ protest of April 14, 2020, show that the six-food Social Distancing Requirement identified above was not maintained by many participants. By doing so, they endangered themselves, their families, their friends, and others with whom they came into contact. When the six-foot Social Distancing Requirement is not followed, law enforcement may intervene to enforce the order, and thereby protect both the public and the protesters themselves,” McKinney writes.In an email, Dory MacMillan, spokesperson for Gov. Cooper told CBS17, “the governor is taking strong steps to slow the spread of COVID-19 with public health and safety as the top priority. The governor’s order does not interfere with first amendment rights and this letter explains that.”Cooper’s stay-at-home order runs until April 29 and could be extended or modified, he has said.The governor has said he’s concerned about the lack of supplies to test people who may be positive for COVID-19, adding that’s a key part of the strategy to reopen the state’s economy.Over the weekend, researchers at Harvard’s Global Health Institute said the country needs to triple its testing capacity to reopen safely.“We need all of these supplies to collect more test samples and to ensure hospitals and first responders have what they need,” Cooper said.A poll conducted last week by Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found 69 percent of North Carolina voters think the state’s response to COVID-19 has “been about right.” Meanwhile, 11 percent of voters feel the state is underreacting, compared to 15 percent who think it’s overreacting.On Monday, state Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Mandy Cohen said COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States, adding that the numbers would be higher if the state had not issued a stay-at- home order.Ashley Smith, one of the organizers of ReOpen NC, is calling for more clarity from Cooper on how he plans to reopen parts of the economy impacted by the virus.“I believe North Carolinians are extremely intelligent and could handle this given the chance without sacrificing their entire livelihood,” she said.U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC 9th) and state Sen. Vickie Sawyer (R-Iredell) have both said they plan to attend Tuesday’s rally. Both called attention to a tweet by Raleigh Police at last week’s rally in which they said, “Protesting is a non-essential activity.”Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said as with other protests in Raleigh, law enforcement agencies have discussed how to respond to Tuesday’s demonstration.“Law enforcement is prepared, hopefully, to maintain a safe opportunity for people to have their voices heard, but they’re also prepared that if necessary they’ll take action and enforce the law,” she said. “These types of activities place a lot of extra stress and responsibility on already insufficient law enforcement resources.”The letter sent over the weekend to Cooper and Commissioner Ford also called on the charge against Monica Ussery, who was arrested last week, to be dropped.Freeman said she did not receive the letter directly but later obtained a copy of it. She said she’s asked to review police body camera footage from the protest. “I did authorize that charge,” she said. “We will evaluate it and try to make a determination based on the evidence. I certainly respect the role of civil disobedience. At the end of the day, our responsibility is to uphold the law, and we will do that.”Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

These days, if anything on wheels is powered by an engine which makes more than 700 HP, it gets elevated into the 'Monster' category. Complex electronics and aerodynamic components play a big part for that power to be harnessed clinically. However, back in 1988, things weren't the same. Yet, the Nissan GTP ZX-Turbo was fitted with a V6 engine from the VG family which cranked out 800+ HP. The engine block was similar to the one fitted on the road-going 300ZX (Fairlady) but was paired with a massive turbocharger whose boost pressure could be adjusted on the fly!

Highlands Park have issued a stern warning to Premier Soccer League (PSL) clubs gunning for striker Peter Shalulile’s signature, saying they won’t sell him to a local club.
 According to the club’s media officer, Sibonelo Ngidi, the Lions of the North are looking to follow in the footsteps of Ajax Cape Town who are known for selling some of their players to overseas clubs.
 The Namibia international has been reportedly linked with a move to Bidvest Wits, SuperSport United and Kaizer Chiefs as Amakhosi reportedly identified the speedy forward as Leonardo Castro’s replacement.
 “We will not sell Shalulile to a South African club. The management is only prepared to listen to offers coming from overseas clubs,” Ngidi told _Isolezwe_.
 “We want to operate similar to the way Ajax Cape Town did in the past few years. They have made money by selling players to overseas clubs.
 “They made big money on Thulani Serero alone, they managed to use that money to sustain the club and ensure they remain competitive.”
 Although the 2019/20 MTN8 losing finalists may not match salaries from clubs such as the PSL log leaders, Ngidi explains the club has engaged Shalulile in terms of matching offers from the big guns.
 “The management has sat down with him and told him that even though they may not match the salary offers some of the clubs are promising but they can try and get closer to it,” added the media officer.
 “They told him that he is respected here and his contribution is acknowledged. However, if he goes to a new club he will have to start afresh and fight for his place in the starting eleven. He, therefore, decided to stay.”
 Having established himself as one of the top strikers in the South African top-flight, the 27-year-old is a key figure for coach Owen Da Gama’s troops as they look to remain in the elite division for many seasons.
 Taking a look at his contribution this term, the former Tura Magic FC striker has netted 12 goals and seeks to overtake against Orlando Pirates’ Gabadinho Mhango who has 14 strikes, for the top goalscorer award.
