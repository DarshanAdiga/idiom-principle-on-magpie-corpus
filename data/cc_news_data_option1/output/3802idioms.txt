CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Principals, counselors, and staff from 18 high schools across the state — including Winfield High School — are being recognized for their schools’ efforts to inform students of higher education opportunities after graduation.
 The “Champion of College Access and Success” recognition awards are annually presented by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission to select schools that go the extra mile to help students and their families plan for college.
 Dr. Sarah Armstrong Tucker, West Virginia’s Chancellor for Higher Education, said staff at all high schools across the state are working diligently to help the state reach its goal of a 60% post-secondary education attainment rate by the year 2030; however, the schools recognized have exceeded expectations in helping their students understand what opportunities are available after high school.
 “These 18 Champion schools have worked tirelessly to help students to prepare for a certificate or degree after graduation,” she said in a news release. “We must all work together to help young people pursue their academic goals, especially in this challenging time for our students, and ensure our state’s workforce remains competitive. I want to thank these schools for going above and beyond to help their students discover the many education and training opportunities they have right here at home.”
 For high schools to be considered a Champion of College Access and Success, they must participate in three college-planning milestone events during the school year:

Thursday’s activities provided another potential hurdle for a facility that was expected to be operational more than two years ago.
 Founded in 2016 and based in Charleston, U.S. Methanol broke ground on the Institute facility — which was to be made of parts from a deconstructed methanol plant from Brazil — in November 2017. Components were to be shipped from Brazil and assembled in time for a mid-2018 launch. But a series of delays occurred.
 They ranged from issues relating to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro to the replacement of equipment that did not pass customs safety inspections. The start of construction was pushed back to May 2019, and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year brought construction to a halt. The company has not announced when work will resume.
 This isn’t the first time the project has come under fire.
 Some discourse developed during the plant’s planning phases, specifically with regard to the approximately 300 temporary construction jobs it would create. That contract was awarded to Bilfinger Westcon, a North Dakota-based construction company.
 Bilfinger’s CEO said at the time it would lure workers from within a 200-mile radius — some of whom might not be from West Virginia — and the project would be shepherded from the company’s Canton, Ohio, office. The choice of Bilfinger drew criticism from various labor organizations who argued an in-state contractor likely would have made hiring West Virginia labor a priority.
 That history was referenced by UA Local 625 in its response to U.S. Methanol’s statement.
 “U.S. Methanol has consistently given the major portions of the project to out-of-state contractors who have imported out-of-state workers. Local contractors and workers have gotten some small portions. … These are significant jobs that local workers are losing. Local workers are tired of the crumbs.”
 Methanol is obtained from natural gas and is used in the production of fuel, LED and LCD screens, pharmaceuticals and more. Initial estimates were for the facility to produce approximately 200,000 metric tons of methanol per year.
 When it is completed, Green said the Institute plant is expected to have a full-time staff of 70 people serving in administrative and operation capacities.
