When Diana, Princess of Wales died in 1997, the Queen faced a tsunami of anger in Britain over her handling of the situation including her initial refusal to fly the flag at half-mast at the palace and her refusal to come back to London. It took her years and years to gradually replace the picture of her as a cold-hearted autocrat unresponsive to the outpouring of her people and to morph into the grandmotherly figure beloved by the nation.

SIK1 mediates HDAC7 stability. Established cardiac class IIa HDAC kinases in the heart, such as CaMK and protein kinase C/D (21–23), directly phosphorylate class IIa HDACs, leading to their nuclear export and subsequent derepression of MEF2 transcriptional activity. In contrast, our data on SIK1 support a differentiated mode of regulation that uncovers a new layer of control at the level of HDAC7 protein stabilization. In the heart, SIK1-mediated stabilization of HDAC7 is robust and appears to be specific for HDAC7 over other class IIa family members. Why HDAC7 stability is particularly sensitive to SIK1 inhibition is unclear, especially in light of the fact that other class IIa HDAC kinases (CaMK, PKD) can phosphorylate similar epitopes. Previous studies have shown that CaMKII signals exclusively to HDAC4 through a unique CaMKII docking sequence present only on HDAC4 and is absent in other class IIa HDACs (23). It is possible that the specificity of SIK1 signaling could be achieved through a similar docking domain within HDAC7.

This vision of the Queen - out of touch, highhanded and obtusely putting her son before her country - could wreak long term damage on the house of Windsor.
