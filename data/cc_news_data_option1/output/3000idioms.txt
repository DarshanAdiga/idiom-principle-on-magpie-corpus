From plagues to earthquakes, disasters often push people in wholly new directions. Will the current pandemic be the same? An inkling of a shift comes from a new study at the University of Michigan. It found more Americans have turned to mainstream news sites since the COVID-19 crisis began. They have shied away from what researchers call “iffy” sources on social media.


  This “flight to quality,” as the study puts it, is more than a desire for truth about ways to avoid personal harm. People are also worried about the virus’s impact on the world. Others have had their beliefs about nature, God, or humanity challenged. Trained journalists in traditional media have provided access to practical advice as well as broad meaning.


  The study’s conclusion: “It appears people turn to tried and true sources of information” to navigate through a life-and-death situation and all its uncertainties.” But, adds Paul Resnick, one of the researchers, “It will be interesting to see whether this ‘flight to quality’ is short-lived.”


  A crisis like a pandemic can quickly restore people’s trust in their ability to know the truth – and to seek out trustworthy news. Traffic to traditional media outlets has surged since the pandemic began. And social media platforms like Facebook are culling disinformation about COVID-19 from their sites.


  This truth-seeking is a frequent reaction after a disaster. When three earthquakes and a tsunami killed tens of thousands in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1755, the enormity of the devastation triggered a revolution among Europeans about the role of God in such events. People began to develop critical thinking skills and the tools for fact-checking. This gave them the information and the mental acuity to put disasters in context.

So it's a little bit different mix. But we're happy to see it kind of coming back to the 1,600 pound range. And we expect that is more of the smaller accounts come back online. It could drift down a little bit lower, but that 1,600 pound range is continued into the July at this point. And so, if we can see that stay around that sort of level for the time being, that'd be a good trends and contributor too to the overall revenue per shipment that we're seeing.

But generally most of the activity is from exits. And then inflows are obviously as we're raising capital around it and that’s really has been a big piece. You also see some inflows as we activate for fee earning AUM, so as we activate funds that we have raised, which would be otherwise included in total AUM but not included in fee earning AUM, until we activate them, and so they'll come in there. And then some of the funds which are dependent upon us investing, they'll flow into fee earning AUM as we invest that capital. So those are what really accounts for some of the ups and downs in the roll forward.

Everything sounds good from the motorized task force in Ocean City, but we have all learned time will tell. There is reason for optimism, however.


  All indications are the pop-up car rally (the new term because associating it with the former H2Oi event is irresponsible) will be a major problem again at the end of September.


  It's realistic to expect the thousands of vehicles and lewd owners and passengers to crowd Ocean City like they have every year. We don't see the current health pandemic having any impact on this lot of characters. They will come to Ocean City intent on raising hell and disrespecting our resort town and properties. We will most likely see a rise in local infections as a result, but most of these people come from outside the area.


  The good news is the police force in Ocean City and the allied agencies understand well the pandemic will not deter them and have been preparing on a two-track front - one involving toughening current statewide legislation and the other centered on municipal amendments.

Lo ha detto l'europarlamentare Raffaele Fitto (FdI), candidato del centrodestra alla presidenza della Regione Puglia, ai giornalisti che gli hanno chiesto quale sia la sua ricetta post Covid, a margine di un evento a Trani.   «Quindi bisogna avere una visione - ha aggiunto Fitto - cambiare la strategia della nostra regione, farla essere presente in Europa, ai tavoli nazionali e non farla brillare per assenza, e avere la capacita di poter dare risposte chiare non solo utilizzando le risorse europee che sono a disposizione della nostra regione, ma avere la capacita di cogliere e utilizzare anche le altre che potrebbe essere una opportunita che oggi non sono prese in considerazione».   Sulla proroga dello stato di emergenza per il Coronavirus, Fitto ha detto che «e una proroga che si giustifica soltanto con una scelta politica collegata al governo, l'unico governo che ha fatto una cosa del genere ed e chiaro ed evidente che parliamo di una scelta piu politica che motivata e giustificata dal punto di vista scientifico».

Ao jogar jogos de FPS, sempre há uma chance de você ser morto por um sniper, o que pode ser frustrante. Em _VALORANT_ , alguns jogadores acham que o Operador está forte demais. No entanto, a Riot não concorda.
 Durante a última stream do designer de personagens Ryan "Morello" Scott, ele disse que este é um problema de jogador e não do Operator. Ele disse que a Riot está estudando fortalecer outras utilidades antes de enfraquecer a arma.
 "Não achamos que o operator esteja quebrado", disse Morello. “Acreditamos que algumas utilidades podem estar com um desempenho inferior em Elos intermediários, mas não nos Elos de elite ou especialistas. Não achamos que haja um problema de balanceamento.”
 O Operator tem o maior dano por bala de todas as armas do jogo devido ao seu potencial de matar com um tiro no corpo. Para compensar isso, seu custo é alto, 4.500 créditos.
 "Existe um problema de 'não consigo acessar as ferramentas necessárias para combater um operator' em muitos casos", disse Morello. “É muito mais difícil coordenar uma equipe descoordenada que esteja sofrendo contra operators. Não achamos que o Operator esteja realmente quebrado.”
 Os jogadores precisam considerar avaliar seu estilo de jogo antes de culpar a arma pelo abate.
 “Você cruza uma esquina e tem um OP parado nela, ele atira em você e você morre? Isso é design, não vamos consertar isso”, disse Morello.
 Morello acha que usar agentes como Cypher, que é focado em vigilância, e Sage, que é focada em ser suporte da equipe, deixando de lado outras contra escolhas à Operator, está destacando parte do problema.
 "Se você estiver jogando com duas sentinelas, minha expectativa é que os OPs dêem trabalho", disse Morello. “Se você usa dois controladores, acho muito mais fácil de lidar com OPs. Minha preocupação é que não vejamos pessoas usando um Breach, Phoenix, ou Reyna que tenham utilidades rápidas, porque acho que esse tipo de utilidade pode não ser suficientemente potente em comparação com algumas das armas.”
 A Riot está se concentrando em outras soluções, fortalecendo as contra jogadas. Mas essas contra jogadas que a Riot tem para o Operator podem não estar funcionando como planejado e podem precisar de um fortalecimento se os números tenderem a ser mais poderosos do que se pensava inicialmente.

That's part of the charm of Donnie Durag's "No Laughin," featuring Sky Johnson & HighGrades. The video sees the three rappers performing on the roof of a park building one minute and then situated under a bridge the next — the pond's unmistakable green algae floating behind them. It's a low-budget romp with a simple message delivered by Durag about putting the park on the map. It's an admirable, if foolhardy, goal, considering the park has probably never been this popular in decades. To their credit, the three up-and-coming rappers all play distinct roles: Durag handles the hook with a confident edge, Johnson's verse is the most melodic and laconic, while HighGrades gravely and dexterous flow helps him secure the song's best verse. "No Laughin" is rough around the edges, but what part of life isn't right now?

Steve Howe, “Love Is” (BMG) Steve Howe’s guitar mastery was a key component of the success of prog-rock masters Yes and you can hear some of his trademark acoustic and electric sounds on “Love Is,” his first solo album since 2011. Occasionally overly mellow and held back by his limited vocal range, the album still has enough flashes of Howe’s stringed wizardry to attract a crowd. Beyond his work with Yes, Asia and GTR, to name a few of the lineups he’s anchored over the years, Howe has also appeared on songs by acts as diverse as Queen, Lou Reed and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Howe performs just about every sound on “Love Is,” and the 10 compositions are split evenly between instrumentals and songs, alternating in the running order. His son Dylan plays drums and Jon Davison, the singer in the current Yes formation led by Howe, handles backing vocals and bass on the songs. Opener “Fulcrum” has a “Christmas with Hank Marvin” vibe, while “See Me Through” is catchy and well- paced but a stronger lead voice could have put it over the top. Howe described the quasi-title tune, “Love Is A River,” as “a sort of quintessential track,” and its changes of pace and mix of environmental and mystical preoccupations make it one of the most Yes-sounding efforts here. In fact, you can discover snippets of Howe’s classic Yes-era arpeggios, strums and solos on practically all the tracks but as the minutes pass, they too often fade into less distinctive ideas. Closer “On the Balcony” opens with a furious GTR-like riff, deals with the challenges of live performances and Davison’s vocal support again so eerily echoes Howe’s seemingly eternally estranged former bandmate, Jon Anderson, that it’s bound to provoke double takes. Howe recently told...

NEW YORK (AP) — When historians look back on the top films at the box office in the summer of 2020, they may feel like they’ve slipped into a time warp, or maybe “Back to the Future.” Over the second weekend in July, “Empire Strikes Back” — 40 years after it was first released — was again No. 1. “Ghostbusters” claimed the July 4th weekend, 36 years after opening. Over the June 19-21 weekend and 27 years after it last led the box office, “Jurassic Park” again ruled theaters. In a pandemic that has resurrected all kinds of vintage pastimes, from puzzles to drive-ins, even the blockbusters are retro. That is much out of necessity. About 1,000 theaters in the U.S. are currently open, just about a sixth of the nation’s cinemas. That includes the approximately 300 drive-ins that have, since the multiplexes shuttered in March, hosted the majority of moviegoing. With all major new releases postponed until at least Labor Day weekend, summer moviegoing has again belonged to the classics — the kinds of films that, for many, remain as indelibly linked to the season as E.T. is to Elliott. Brian Keasey, a 44-year- old in Montrose, Colorado, has been going every week, when he’s not playing movies on his backyard screen. “I saw ‘Jaws’ on the big screen. I saw ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ on the big screen. I saw my childhood on the big screen,” said Keasey a few hours before heading to a double-feature of “Ghostbusters” and “The Rental,” a new indie horror film by Dave Franco. This is American moviegoing in the summer of 2020. A nostalgic trip to the drive-in. A white sheet hung off the patio. The comforting reunion with a great white shark. Keasey says he’s seen “Jaws” three times this summer, including once on a screen improvised next to a pond. “It’s the classic summer...

ATLANTA (AP) — Former President Barack Obama used Rep. John Lewis’ funeral on Thursday to issue a stark warning that the voting rights and equal opportunity the late civil rights icon championed are under increasing threat heading into the 2020 election. Obama, speaking from the pulpit of the church that Martin Luther King Jr. once led, called on Congress to renew the Voting Rights Act, which the Supreme Court diminished in 2012. “You want to honor John, let’s honor him by revitalizing the law that he was willing to die for,” Obama said. Obama endorsed ending the Senate filibuster if that is what’s needed to pass an overhauled voting law. The first Black president called the procedural hurdle that effectively requires 60 votes to pass major legislation a “Jim Crow relic,” referring to the segregation era. The Democratic-led House has adopted a sweeping rewrite of the Voting Rights Act, and Democrats want to name the act after Lewis. But it faces opposition in the Republican-led Senate. Obama did not name President Donald Trump or any GOP congressional leaders, and he noted that the original Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its renewal over the years have drawn Republican and Democratic votes in Congress and been signed by presidents from both parties. But, he said, “There are those in power doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws.” Obama’s eulogy for Lewis came hours after Trump suggested delaying the November election, something he doesn’t have the authority to do. Trump has falsely claimed that increased use of mail-in ballots because of the coronavirus pandemic will threaten the election’s legitimacy. Lewis, who died July 17 at the age...

When we when we did that deal with Allio I think we more than doubled our land package there at Rochester off to the west and so there is a lot to do out there and then Hans already talked about crown and Seahorse and then we have sterling down there all of that down in southern Nevada. There is a lot of drilling ahead and hopefully a lot of new discovery and a lot of resource growth. So no shortage of exploration opportunity.

FOLLY BEACH S.C. (WCSC) - As the pandemic presses on in South Carolina and&nbsp;Tropical Storm Isaias forms south of Florida, leaders in coastal cities across the Lowcountry are making sure storm preparations also match COVID-19 precautions.&nbsp;“We have been through the drill of hurricanes year after year after year, forever,” Isle of Palms mayor Jimmy Carroll said. “Now, we’ve got this new, unprecedented pandemic that has added some thing where we have to use the CDC guidelines.”During severe storms, all hands are on deck. That means certain city staff including first respondents have to stay in their station during the storm.&nbsp;Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach director of public safety, said that could mean up to 35 people housed during the storm.&nbsp;“One of the biggest concerns with COVID is making sure that we can have people spread out, have enough room to put people,” Gilreath said. “We are a 24 hour operation. So the key is with feeding and housing, making sure they were also doing that safely and making sure we are good to go as far as COVID protocols.”Gilreath said there will be no changes to response protocols. Fire and police will be sent out to calls during storms until they're told otherwise for safety.&nbsp;Carroll said agencies on Isle of Palms are also adjusting their hurricane preparations to incorporate&nbsp;more social distancing during long storms.&nbsp;But Carroll says there's another challenge beyond COVID-19 facing the Isle of Palms' police department this hurricane season.&nbsp;“To add insult to injury on the Isle of Palms, our public safety building down on front beach is being refurbished...so our police and fire are working out of trailers out of the side of the building,” Caroll said. “We have got them strapped down I think to about a hurricane category too. But beyond that we may have to take the trailers off the island if it became worse.”Carroll said leaders in beach towns across the Lowcountry are paying attention to the path of Tropical Storm Isaias and working with county officials to be prepared throughout the season.&nbsp;Copyright 2020 WCSC.

The HuffPost/YouGov poll came the same week Trump stoked racist fears in an appeal to white suburbanites, warning about an impending invasion of low- income housing that only he could stop. Touting his rescinding of an Obama-era fair housing rule, Trump told people living their “Suburban Lifestyle Dream” that “crime will go down” in the suburbs because of his action. The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing mandate required suburbs subsidized by federal grants and aid to evaluate their racial segregation and offer plans to address the issue. (Suburbs, which exploded during an even more explicitly racist period in American history, were heavily subsidized by the federal government, which for decades locked Black Americans out of the opportunity to build up their savings through homeownership, exacerbating the current massive racial gap in wealth.)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress has awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, its highest honor, to surviving crew members of the USS Indianapolis, the ship that delivered key components of the first nuclear bomb and was later sunk by Japan during World War II. The ship, with 1,195 personnel aboard, delivered enriched uranium and other parts of the atomic bomb ‘‘Little Boy\" that was later dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in August 1945. Four days after delivering its top secret cargo, the ship was sunk by Japanese torpedoes on July 30, 1945. Of nearly 900 men who went into the Philippine Sea, just 316 survived before being rescued nearly five days later. The death toll of 879 was the largest single disaster at sea in U.S. Navy history. Survivors were stranded in the open ocean with few lifeboats and almost no food or water, enduring severe burns, dehydration and shark attacks. \"In an instant, her crew went from fighting the battles without to fighting the battles within,'' said Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, one of a host of congressional and Navy leaders who spoke at Thursday's virtual ceremony honoring the eight surviving crew members on the 75th anniversary of the sinking. The Gold Medal was awarded to the ship's entire crew, living and dead, and will be displayed at the Indiana War Memorial Museum in Indianapolis. After the sinking, the crew “fought to stay alert, to look after each other — literally to hold on for dear life,'' said McConnell, R-Ky. He and other speakers were shown on video because of the global coronavirus pandemic. “Those who perished in the water gave our nation the ultimate sacrifice ... but the true legacy of the Indianapolis was secured before those torpedoes struck,'' McConnell said. \"Her crew turned the tide of the war.

That's part of the charm of Donnie Durag's "No Laughin," featuring Sky Johnson & HighGrades. The video sees the three rappers performing on the roof of a park building one minute and then situated under a bridge the next -- the pond's unmistakable green algae floating behind them. It's a low-budget romp with a simple message delivered by Durag about putting the park on the map. It's an admirable, if foolhardy, goal, considering the park has probably never been this popular in decades. To their credit, the three up-and-coming rappers all play distinct roles: Durag handles the hook with a confident edge, Johnson's verse is the most melodic and laconic, while HighGrades gravely and dexterous flow helps him secure the song's best verse. "No Laughin" is rough around the edges, but what part of life isn't right now?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held up India's track record of providing developmental aid to neighbours without any conditions and in line with their priorities, in a tacit reference to China and the "debt trap" created by its big-ticket projects,


  India's development partnerships are marked by respect, diversity, care for the future and sustainable development, Modi said as he and his Mauritius counterpart Pravind Jugnauth inaugurated the new Supreme Court building in Port Louis during a virtual ceremony.


  Modi didn't refer to other countries involved in development cooperation in the neighbourhood, though he appeared to be making a distinction between Indian aid and Chinese-backed projects, including the Belt and Road Initiative that have led to several countries in the region falling into a "debt trap".


  "For India, the most fundamental principle in development cooperation is respecting our partners. This sharing of development lessons is our only motivation," Modi said.


  "That is why our development cooperation does not come with any conditions. It is not influenced by political or commercial considerations," he said.


  In the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka leased the strategic Hambantota port to a Chinese firm for 99 years in 2017 after the country was unable to repay Chinese loans for developing the facility. The current government of the Maldives has sought India's help to cope with massive loans taken from China by the previous regime.


  India's development and security cooperation with smaller Indian Ocean states has been a key part of its "neighbourhood first" policy, with work continuing on projects in areas ranging from health care to defence amid the Covid-19 pandemic.


  Modi highlighted his government's vision of "Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)" for the Indian Ocean region and said: "Our development partnerships reflect the development priorities of our partner nations."


  Modi outlined the projects taken up and completed in diverse fields through India's development partnerships, including the Parliament building in Afghanistan, the Mahatma Gandhi Convention Centre in Niger, an emergency and trauma hospital in Nepal, and emergency ambulance services in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka.


  An oil pipeline project being implemented with Nepal will ensure the availability of petroleum products in the Himalayan nation, while another scheme will provide drinking water and sanitation in 34 islands of the Maldives. "We have tried to make cricket popular in countries as diverse as Afghanistan and Guyana by helping build stadiums and other facilities," he said.


  The Supreme Court building in Port Louis, built with grant assistance of $28.12 million, is part of a special economic package of $353 million provided by India.


  Other infrastructure schemes taken up under this package are the Metro Express project worth $275 million, the first phase of which has been completed, a $14-million ENT Hospital, which too has been completed, and a social housing project with nearly 1,000 units.


  India is the largest development partner for Mauritius, to which it has provided lines of credit worth $600 million on concessional terms. India is assisting in the building of health care facilities such as a renal unit, four medical clinics and two health centres in the country.


  Modi said India is also focusing on sustainable development through institutions such as the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. "Both initiatives are of special relevance to island countries," he added.


  In his speech, Jugnauth thanked the government and people for their solidarity in trying times amid the pandemic. He said Mauritius had benefited from medicines and equipment supplied by India and the three-week-long deployment of a medical team on board the Indian warship INS Kesari.


  He described the new Supreme Court building as a milestone in the modernisation of the infrastructure of Mauritius that will enable the judiciary to use new technologies to make justice more accessible to all. Judges often had to wait to use the limited number of courtrooms at the old building to hear cases, he added.


  Former ambassador Rajiv Bhatia, distinguished fellow for foreign policy studies at Gateway House, said India's development projects in South Asia and Africa highlighted how the approach of Indian policy-makers was different from that of the Chinese.


  "India's projects are part of a partnership of equals, not in terms of resources but in terms of mutual respect. China says the same thing but the facts show otherwise. If the same was true in the case of China, something like Hambantota port wouldn't have happened," he said.


  "India opts for elaborate and lengthy consultations on these projects, which are based on the needs of other countries - we don't fly down to a country and say this is what you're going to get."

Willey was jettisoned to accommodate Jofra Archer in England's World Cup squad last year, but with several regulars absent due to their Test commitments the Yorkshire left-armer took centre stage on his international comeback. In England's first home ODI since winning their first global 50-over tournament, Willey's five for 30 restricted Ireland to 172 all out in 44.4 overs, a total the hosts overhauled with six wickets to spare. England had lurched to 78 for four but Sam Billings, included after Joe Denly's withdrawal due to a back injury, settled any nerves with a supreme 67 not out off 54 deliveries in an unbroken 96-run stand with captain Eoin Morgan. England therefore got over the line with 22.1 overs still remaining at the start of a three-ODI series which marks the start of the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, forming part of the qualification process for India 2023. But, on a surface where timing proved troublesome for a number of batsmen, the day belonged to Willey, who was chiefly responsible for Ireland teetering on 28 for five after being invited to bat first under sunny skies. After the players took a knee to support Black Lives Matter, Ireland were saved from freefall by international debutant Curtis Campher, a South African-born all-rounder who qualifies through his mother's passport. The 21-year-old showed no lack of patience and fortitude in his 59 not out from 118 balls in front of the vast swathes of empty seats, before Willey returned to the attack and ended the innings. Willey's prowess with the new ball is well-known and despite little evidence of significant movement, he was still in business as Paul Stirling clipped to mid-wicket before Ireland captain Andrew Balbirnie was tempted into an expansive drive, only succeeding in nicking through to Jonny Bairstow. Saqib Mahmood cramped Harry Tector for room and the ODI debutant chopped on while Willey struck twice in two balls as Gareth Delany sliced to backward point to end a counter-attacking 22 from 16 deliveries, before Lorcan Tucker was trapped in front - a decision overturned on review after technology showed the ball crashing into leg stump. Campher survived the hat-trick ball and showed maturity beyond his years in steadying the ship alongside Kevin O'Brien and then Andy McBrine, partnerships of 51 and 66 which helped Ireland avoid abject humiliation. O'Brien holed out as he went in search of his first boundary on 22, while McBrine's 40 featured a towering six over mid-wicket off Moeen Ali, but his patience also ran out as he was caught in the deep. Either side of those dismissals Simi Singh was run out after being sent back attempting a quick single. Campher's knock contained just four fours but he ran out of partners before he had the chance to counter-attack, Willey fittingly ending Ireland's innings when last man Craig Young toe-ended to mid- off. Campher's watchful innings ensured England would not have a perfunctory chase in the late evening sunshine and that was underlined when Bairstow was trapped in front by off-spinner McBrine after seamer Barry McCarthy had limped off in the first over. Jason Roy and James Vince both flickered briefly before succumbing to Young, lbw and caught behind for 24 and 25 respectively, and England were in some strife when Campher struck four balls into his international career. Campher had accounted for Tom Banton for South Africa's Under-19 side a couple of years ago and history repeated itself when the Somerset batsman top-edged a pull, with Ireland wicketkeeper Tucker taking a steepling catch. Morgan had demoted himself to six but came to the crease to join Billings, who twice reverse swept Singh for four and seemed more confident on a surface that had given his top-order team-mates trouble. A crisp pull for his ninth four took him to a 41-ball fifty before Morgan (36 not out) thumped Singh back over his head to finish the game in style.

ANNA - Anna Police Chief Jeff Caponera says family considerations were a driving force behind his decision to leave Anna and become chief of the Grafton Police Department in Grafton, Wisconsin.


   


  While he and his wife both hail from Colorado, they have family in the upper Midwest and look forward to being closer to them.


   


  "The decision was hard, I'm not going to lie," Caponera said. "We have such a great group of folks who work here and care about the community. The next chief that comes here is going to be very happy."


   


  The city of Anna plans to announce its interim plans by the end of the week.


   


  Caponera's official retirement date with Anna is Aug. 31. He will begin his new role in Grafton on Sept. 21.


   


  Caponera joined the Anna Police Department in 2008. He was promoted to interim chief in 2018, a role that became permanent in July of that year.


   


  Prior to that, he served on the city's Planning and Zoning Commission, Technology Committee and Board of Adjustments. He was also elected to the Anna City Council in 2008 but never took office because he was hired as a police sergeant.


   


  "I greatly appreciate his service, and we at the city of Anna wish him the best," Mayor Nate Pike said. "I think he's done a really good job of bringing a culture of community policing where our officers get to know the residents in our community."


   


  Caponera's law enforcement career also includes stints with the Adams County Sheriff's office and Thornton Police Department, both in Colorado, as well as the Collin County Constable's office.


   


  He also attended the FBI Academy where he met current Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, Undersheriff Christy Knowles. She first told him about the Grafton opening.


   


  With his retirement eligibility date approaching this year, Caponera had been pondering his future plans.


   


  In addition to being closer to family, he liked the idea of living in an area that actually has four seasons.


   


  In Grafton, he found a community with many of the same qualities he liked in Anna. It's a town of less than 20,000 people located in the outer fringes of the suburbs, about 25 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.


   


  He was attracted to the city's vibrant downtown and community feel. While its weather there may not be warm, he said the welcome he received there was.


   


  "It's definitely a place where you would want to take your family and be happy raising your family," Caponera said.


   


  Under Wisconsin statute, Grafton's police chief is chosen by a police and fire commission responsible for hiring, firing and discipline. The Village Administrator then works with their chosen candidate to finalize the terms of employment.


   


  Before making its decision earlier this summer, the commission gave finalists the opportunity to meet with current police officers, city staff and community stakeholders.


   


  Grafton Village Administrator Jesse Thyes said he came away impressed with Caponera's credentials and the way he handled the meeting, particularly in light of the awkward face masks and social distancing requirements in place during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.


   


  Thyes also praised Caponera for his confidence, a quality he considers vastly important for a chief of police.


   


  "He was just very forthcoming with everyone. Obviously he was trying to get the job, but it didn't come across that he was trying too hard," Thyes said. "It was the commission's decision, but I felt he was the strongest candidate."


   


  Caponera officially accepted the job offer June 21.


   


  As he looks back on his time in Anna and as an officer in Texas, he cherishes all the relationships he's built over the years.


   


  He said he's learned a lot from the challenges he's faced in Anna, experiences that can't be replaced. He's also proud to have had a hand in many of the positive things that the city has done over the years that he's been involved.


   


  "I have a lot of good friends and a lot of positive relationships with the surrounding chiefs and of course the officers and others," Caponera said. "That's what I'm going to miss - the comradery and the people."

“How is it possible? Won’t they feel breathless?” I whispered into Mohini’s (not her real name) ears.
 “Stupid, one is supposed to be out of breath that time,” Mohini giggled as she imparted this pearl of wisdom.
 “But still...” I remained in doubt as I tried to crane my neck for another look at the object of discussion. It was a film poster on a lamp post near the base of a bridge. It was clear as day that the bloodthirsty vampire in the poster was eager to sink his teeth (perhaps more) into the flesh of a doe-eyed damsel in Bedouin-like clothes. But the title of the film — _Do Gaz Zameen ke Neeche_ — confused me. What’s the fun in being two yards below the surface, in the company of potatoes and earthworms?
 I kept thinking about the logistics till the vampire and his object of desire disappeared one morning. The lamp post was still there though, as was the bridge (until two years ago). And my rusty school bus — which ferried me to a convent and back for more than a decade — drove past them every morning. Mohini and I sat glued to the window for the blink-and-you-miss visual tour of film posters that tickled our imagination and hormones.
 These were films that were never the topic of dinnertime family discussion. These were not films that nuns wanted me, Mohini or any girl in the world to watch. These were films that found no mention in the column for show timings in newspapers. And yet they were at the centre of my universe — and also Mohini’s, who had more knowledge of the human actions that these films focused on.
 The lamp post at the base of the bridge — like many other lamp posts in Kolkata — was the most dedicated member of the support cast. It lent its slender body to the nimble worker who slapped posters on it every Thursday night. From frisky vampires to lustful witches ( _chudail_ or _daayan_ ), the whole gamut of paranormal creatures held the lamp post tight over the years. Asian air hostesses in outlandish blonde wigs and buxom Indian housewives, in nighties and saris as translucent as dim sum dough, filled in when the preternatural sought leave. The occasional _devar_ (brother-in-law), looking suitably naughty and shapely, created a flutter as much as the postman (there were no couriers or pizzas in my schooldays).
 The titles of these films were as spicy as the theme — _Pyaasi Raat_ , _Pyaasa Mera Dil_ , _Bhookhi Aatma_ , _Rangeen Raatein_ , _Airhostess ka Dil_ , _Chudail ki Chahat_ , _Jawani ke Sholay_ , _Meri Hot Bhabhi_ and so on. Heat and thirst seemed to be the leitmotif of the films, given the preference for words such as _pyaas_ (thirst), _pyaasa_ (thirsty), _garmi_ (heat), _aag_ (fire) and _sholay_ (flames).
 I felt the heat too, one sultry summer night, when my knackered mother caught me watching an adult Hollywood film on cable TV. It didn’t matter to her that I was above 18 years of age at the time — fully aware and proud of my legal right to walk into a theatre screening a “blue film”. Such a theatre was less than 100m from the metro station I used daily during my three years of undergraduate studies. Named after a certain goddess, it was truly a pilgrimage of sorts for bored students, desperate couples and frustrated men. The only thing that kept me from paying obeisance at this altar of desire was the thought of taking a thousand bugs to bed. An easier option was to spend time at a bus stand on the other side of the road — just to keep a ‘respectable’ distance — and watch the crooked illustrations of _bhabhis_ , _devars_ and perky _padosans_ (female neighbours) take turns in keeping their patrons in good spirits. The spirit, too, was easily available, in quarts and pints.
 Further away, perched on the side of a flyover that still exists, was another theatre that nurtured the ‘poster girl’ in me. This, too, was on my route to college — call this a quirk of fate or my parents’ belief in holistic education. The queue outside the ticket counter was as constant as the stench that arose from the nullah below the bridge. Unfortunately, there was no bus stand there that I could use as prop. What I found instead was a temple — the kind where people gather to sing, pray and offer sweets and flowers to deities who are oblivious to the fuss around them. To my advantage, the staircase of the temple offered a clear view of the hoarding outside the theatre. The added bonus of munching on the _nakuldana_ — cloyingly sweet sugar balls — distributed by the priest, took care of hunger pangs as I watched the poster of _Her Nights_ making way for _Gair Mard_ (the other man).
 Aren’t forbidden fruits — and films — the sweetest, after all?

Now the second part was I think where you're going with this, I mean philosophically in the past you have made a number of things to balance the portfolio but as you look forward and when Rochester is up and running I could make the case that it's a very significant asset and kind of dominates everything else. How do you and I realize that in the future how do you philosophically think about that is five minds the right thing out then? Does it make more sense take advantage of high prices that move something out right now realize some value to fund this because it's so important or how are you just sort of thinking about that going forward because obviously Rochester kind of I would argue dominate to a large degree going forward or maybe that's philosophically wrong I just like your comments on that.

A familiar face is once again overseeing the Van Alstyne Education Foundation.


   


  Mandy Montgomery recently assumed the role of executive director. She replaces Dacia McBride, who accepted a full-time teaching position with the district this summer.


   


  "I think Dacia did a great job and I just want to carry it on," Montgomery said


   


  Montgomery was instrumental in founding the foundation back in 2012. Her family moved to Van Alstyne in 2006 as it wanted a small-town experience. At the time, she put her career in finance on hold to stay at home with her three kids.


   


  The quality school district was one of the main reasons she moved to the city. After a few years in the area, she approached then-Superintendent John Spies about starting an education foundation.


   


  Spies had seen the benefits of such an organization at a previous career stop in Wylie and said he would help pitch the idea to the school board. Once its members agreed, Montgomery was ready to get to work.


   


  With the help of community leaders Sam Atkins, Bill Benton, Bob Sandford and Donna Kern, they formed a board, established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and drafted the foundation's bylaws.


   


  "Then we had community members that gave the seed money," Montgomery recalled. "From there, it just took off."


   


  This past year, the foundation awarded $40,000 in teacher grants and an equal amount in scholarships for graduating seniors.


   


  For six years Montgomery served as the executive director in a volunteer capacity. At her recommendation, the foundation hired McBride as its first paid executive director.


   


  After stepping back for a while, Montgomery said she now feels refreshed and ready to resume her role. She's excited about new opportunities as the city continues to grow and new business come in. Her hope is the they will fall in love with the area and want to support its schools.


   


  Of course, this may be one of the most challenging years to take over a job that involves extensive fundraising. Three yearly events account for a huge percentage of the foundation's budget.


   


  It was lucky that the annual gala was held in February, just before COVID-19 made large gatherings impossible. However, the Little Big Town 5K could not be held in May. In its place is a virtual run that the foundation has been promoting all summer.


   


  Supporters can still register to participate in the run until Aug. 1. They have until Aug. 8 to complete their runs.


   


  Montgomery also encourages the community to support the annual skeet shoot that is scheduled to be held Oct. 3. Hopes are that the event will proceed since the group sizes are small. Masks and social distancing requirements will likely be in effect.


   


  Montgomery admits that her job is not an easy one, particularly in light of the pandemic. However, the foundation is a cause she truly believes in.


   


  "It's really been my passion. I think that what we do with teacher grants and senior scholarships is important," she said. "What I'm most proud of is that we have a group of such hard working and successful board members that all want to see the foundation succeed."
