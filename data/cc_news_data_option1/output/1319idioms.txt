Film festivals give not only upcoming films an opportunity to make a splash but exhibit many smaller movies that are seeking distribution deals. Of the largest festivals canceled by the pandemic - Cannes, SXSW, Tribeca - each has taken a different approach to the crisis.

Some elements of Tribeca will go straight to viewers, including the festival's virtual reality and immersive storytelling entries (available via Oculus) and the advertising exhibition, Tribeca's X Awards (on tribecafilm.com). The festival has already been hosting "A Short Film a Day Keeps Anxiety Away," with shorts from the festival and Tribeca alumni.

A week ago in this space your humble correspondent prattled on at length about the Red Sox/Yankees playoff game of 1978, in my opinion the best baseball game I ever saw.      As luck would have it, I had the good fortune to moderate a panel discussion with old Red Sox and old Yankee players held less than 48 hours before baseball shut itself down due to the coronavirus. Representing the Yankees were Bucky Dent, Goose Gossage, Graig Nettles, and Mickey Rivers, all of whom played key roles in that game. On the Red Sox side were Luis Tiant, Bill Lee, Bernie Carbo, and Wade Boggs. Tiant and Lee were both on the '78 Red Sox, Carbo had been traded to Cleveland earlier that season, and Boggs, the baby of the group at age 61, didn't reach the majors until 1982. Needless to say, the playoff game was a major topic of discussion.      The event was held in Bonita Springs, Forida (just south of Fort Myers), under the sponsorship of the Ted Williams Museum. It was called "The Rivalry," and that's exactly what it was, especially in those days.

"But even with all of the beneficial provisions included in this new law, I appreciate that it can be difficult and time-consuming to search through federal websites looking for answers or figuring out how help will get to you and your family," continued Carper. "That's why, today, I'm unveiling new resources on my website to ensure Delawareans have the information that they need right at their fingertips. My office and all the members of my team want to make sure assistance is accessible to all those who need it, and we will continue working around the clock to make sure that Delawareans get the help they need quickly."
