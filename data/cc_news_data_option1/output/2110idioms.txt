Raymond should know as well as any performer, as the first person to take on the 6-foot-6, 300-pound, 90-inch waist frame of the Phanatic. He's since become a mascot consultant to the stars and helped create, brand and train the next generation of hundreds of stadium characters. Mascots are as much a ballpark staple as hot dogs and the long ball, and each fuzzy fist bump or chance concourse encounter hooks the youngest fans on the game.

The Allwood Escape is a 113-square-foot cabin that can be constructed using minimal tools in just one or two days. Once constructed, you can choose to have a licensed electrician hook it up with power, and if you're interested in using it throughout the winter, you can install some insulation, too.
 The one-room cabin comes with flooring and walls about seven-feet high. But you do have to purchase either shingles, tile, or some metal material to install proper roofing on the house. Still, that's a small price to pay for a next-level space you can call your own.
 Once it's all constructed, you add your furnishings and voila you've added an extra room to your home without the stress of consulting contractors and noisy construction that lasts way too long.
 At $5,350, the Allwood Escape is a total steal among other tiny homes. Plus, if you live in one of the contiguous states (sorry, Alaska and Hawaii) you can get the tiny home shipped to you for free.

“LGBT activists are doing a victory dance over conquering our U.S. military – but this is only a skirmish in a long battle to homosexualize our entire culture. I expect to see an effort down the road to include ‘transgenders’ in the military. That should be an interesting debate.” —Traditional Values Coalition, press release, 2010
