On Sunday, some 100 newly discharged lone soldiers demonstrated in front of the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling on the Defense Ministry for assistance as they have no parents to live with or any financial support.
 With many discharged less than six months before the coronavirus pandemic, they do not qualify for unemployment benefits from the state because they have not accumulated enough time as citizens with employment.
 One newly released lone soldier who is in debt told Army Radio that she contemplated suicide several times since the start of the pandemic.
 "I have no one to help me, no family to support me financially and the country abandoned me on the day I was released. I work a few jobs and I still can't pay rent," she said.
