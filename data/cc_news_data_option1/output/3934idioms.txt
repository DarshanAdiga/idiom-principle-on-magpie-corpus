  # Boilermaker staff 'eternally optimistic' for return to normalcy; virtual race still brings people together


  James McClendon


  Observer-Dispatch


  This year’s Boilermaker Road Race was certainly not traditional, but the organization’s goal of bringing people together was undeniably achieved.


  The nearly 5,500 participants — 4,338 for the 15K race, 26 for the wheelchair 15K, and 1,005 for the 5K — had several opportunities to share their 2020 Virtual Boilermaker experiences through photos, video and stories on social media.


  “Being the first time we had a virtual Boilermaker, we didn’t know what expect,” said Jordan Peters, the race’s Marketing and Sponsorship Director. “We tried to do things virtually and digitally that could bring people together. We had an exclusive community on Facebook, with about 1,000 race participants. The stories that were shared were just so uplifting.”


  While a few people decided to individually run the traditional course, many chose to make the course their own with unique and creative “mini-makers.”


  “To see all these mini-makers across the country was very special for us,” Peters said. “People took it seriously. They had finish lines and water stations. It’s not the Boilermaker we wanted to have, but when would we ever get to see the Boilermaker run on a mountain? People took the spirit of the race and created some pretty unique things.”


  Of the nearly 5,500 people who registered for the race, just over 2,500 submitted results — which can be viewed though the registration link on the Boilermaker’s home page. Peters said many more people likely ran the Boilermaker, but there may have been extenuating circumstances that kept them from submitting their results.


  As for next year’s Boilermaker, Peters said “that is a tricky situation.”


  Utica’s premiere road race typically takes a year’s worth of prep work, and with the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, returning to the tradition format is still up in the air.


  “Mentally we are preparing to hold the Boilermaker,” Peters said. “The future is completely unpredictable, and we are beholden to the state and the health department. We don’t have any more insight than anyone else, but we are eternally optimistic.”


  Peters did acknowledge that the organization discovered something new in preparation for this year’s virtual event and plan to utilize this information even after things return to normal for the Boilermaker.


  “We have learned that virtual races existed way before COVID,” Peters said. “Virtual races were kind of niche. The Boilermaker did not take them serious. We have learned that there is value and room in the Boilermaker portfolio. Not as a replacement, but we may look at a virtual option moving forward.”


  Peters was adamant that any new format would not “replace” the traditional Boilermaker, but would work as an option for people who may not be able to attend the in-person events.


  “The future of the Boilermaker is not a virtual event,” Peters said, “The Boilermaker is what it is because it brings people together.”

Brashear senior shortstop Hannah Grissom knows her softball fundamentals. But sometimes, in an instant, the body takes control from the mind.


   


  In the top of the sixth inning in a tied ballgame with Milan, Wildcat right fielder Danielle Henry sent a linedrive right in Grissom's direction. Grissom had maybe a second to react as the ball headed toward her chest and just got her glove up in time to snag the laser underhanded.


   


  Was it pretty? No. Did she make the catch and then throw over to first to double off Milan's Gracie Dickson? Yes. That double play -- where sunlight blocked her view of first base -- ended a would-be Milan rally and helped the Tigers win 3-2 on Wednesday.


   


  "I didn't have time to turn my glove the right way, so I just went with it," Grissom said with a laugh. "Then the throw to first was just instinct because the sun was right there. … I just threw where I thought it had to go."


   


  The game was still tied 2-2 at that point, as Brashear (6-4) headed to the plate in the bottom half of the sixth. Milan pitcher Cady Pauley was in one heck of a groove and hadn't allowed a baserunner since the second inning when Kynleigh White hit a home run for the Tigers. Pauley finished with 11 strikeouts and the Tigers had a hard time in the box. Brashear pitcher Alexa Borgmeyer hit a shot out to right-center in the sixth and Milan centerfielder Hallie Weaver made a great catch to keep her off the bases.


   


  Grissom came to bat after that and hit a two-out double to left-center. Haley McNamar hit an RBI single to score Grissom from second base, and that was the ballgame.


   


  "I saw a pretty pitch and I was just trying to get contact," Grissom said. "I wasn't trying to smack it. I think that's when you miss it and you miss the fundamentals. You just have to get the bat on the ball in those situations."


   


  These two teams met on Sept. 19 in the Milan Tournament championship game. Brashear won that contest 7-0, so Milan (5-13) and coach Nathan Dodson came into this game hungry for vengeance. Both squads turned in an excellent contest that either could have won.


   


  Brashear coach Chelsea Clark told her girls they had to come out hot because they knew Milan wanted the win. Even after four errors, the Tigers left those behind to start their late-inning rally.


   


  "We wiped everything clean and momentum and spirits, I believe, clicked in the sixth inning," Clark said. "We knew Milan was coming after us after that 7-0 win over in Milan and we knew they'd be hungry. So I told the girls we'd have to come out and fight tonight."


   


  It was Milan's defense that let the game's first run score, as Pauley overthrew first base on a ball hit by Grissom. But the Wildcats answered in the second with a two-run triple from Jordyn Gray. Unfortunately for Milan, those were the only runs they scored.


   


  They just needed that extra hit. Milan stranded runners on third in the first two innings and several others after that. As Brashear's offense was quiet for most of the game, Milan's got players on base. But Borgmeyer did a great job of limiting potential damage.


   


  Wednesday marked the fifth game Milan has lost by two or fewer runs, which shows they're just a few hits shy of an even better record. Regardless of that, Dodson is happy that his team is in these tight games with chances to win.


   


  "For a team that just hasn't been there before, it's getting over that hump. We're right there," Dodson said. "Tonight, I felt like we left a lot out there. We had runners on second or third, I believe, four times and twice with one out or less. We just needed a timely hit to break things open. … We hit the ball well and we've been hitting the ball well. The scoreboard wouldn't indicate that, but we just needed an extra hit or to string three hits in an inning."


   


  Much like Grissom's double play, not every game has been pretty for Brashear. But they're piling up wins and gaining respect with a week left in the regular season. The Tigers have won games where they've made several mistakes, which shows the potential they have if they clean that up.


   


  "That's intestinal fortitude to me," Clark said. "No matter what, you're able to dig down inside and find that spirit and that hope for your team, and do what you can to find success."

Roughly 30 minutes into Marc Meyers’ _We Summon the Darkness_ , the tables turn. The twist isn’t telegraphed. Paranoid viewers might catch the scent of something “off,” the way people with hyperosmia know the milk’s gone bad before opening up the carton, but noticing the clues that Meyers, screenwriter Alan Trezza and the film’s main cast—Alexandra Daddario, Maddie Hasson and Amy Forsyth—leave on the screen takes a little deductive reasoning and a lot of psychological study. No one gives anything away. Instead, Meyers carefully pulls the truth from the set-up, and in the process hints at not a small amount of relish on his part. He’s having fun. A good twist _should_ be fun, and _We Summon the Darkness_ does indeed have a good twist, but Meyers, Trezza and especially Daddario appear to realize that the pleasure of a twist isn’t the reveal, it’s figuring out how to hide the twist in plain sight. This is, at first, a horror story about teenagers uniting under the banner of heavy metal in 1980s America, a time when God-fearing Christian bedwetters saw proof of devil worship everywhere they gawked and blamed the rise of Satanism on objectively awesome things like _Dungeons & Dragons_ and Dio. Half an hour in, _We Summon the Darkness_ still is that story, but told from the perspective of religious vultures who happily exploit the fears of the flock to profit the church. It’s a ferocious joy to watch, particularly in light of how well _We Summon the Darkness_ holds back on secrets. Tipping the hand too much would be easy; the tells only become clear after the fact, couched in a choice of words here, a moment of hesitation there, a dose of forced enthusiasm there. For as unrestrained as things get, it’s the initial restraint that’s most memorable. — _Andy Crump_

During his relief appearance last week against the Buccaneers, Rypien methodically guided Denver's offense down the field (8 of 9 passing) with mostly underneath throws and one big play to an open Jerry Jeudy over the middle. The drive ended when he tried to hold or move safety Mike Edwards with his eyes before ripping a pass into the end zone, but Edwards made a spectacular one-handed interception. That play demonstrated Rypien's refinement -- attempting to hold the safety with his eyes -- but just didn't have enough velocity behind his pass to squeeze the tight-window throw into Jeudy for a score. Worth noting too -- Rypien came off the initial read a little too quickly to really sell it and the pass was going to be on the money.

Fans of zombie cinema were hotly anticipating at least one South Korean zombie feature this year: _Peninsula_ , the sequel to the much-loved _Train to Busan_ was heavily hyped, but ultimately fell far short of the original. Thankfully, though, there was another Korean zombie flick waiting in the wings to step into its place, in the form of the significantly more successful (if modest) _#Alive_. Fans of the original _World War Z_ novel will certainly find this story familiar, as it’s suspiciously similar to one of that book’s better-loved passages, about a young gamer/hacker in Japan who is so deeply engrossed in the web, he fails to notice the world descending into a zombie apocalypse around him, before finally being forced to unplug and go on the run. Here, the same basic premise is simply transplanted to South Korea, where the introverted protagonist must rappel down the side of his apartment building to avoid the prowling dead, while also looking for other survivors hiding among the carnage. It’s a much tighter, more neatly executed story than the disappointing excesses of _Peninsula_ , perfect for pandemic-era viewing. — _Jim Vorel_

Many viewers will think of ending _I’m Thinking of Ending Things_ not long after it’s started. A cross-dissolve cascade of crude shots details the interior of a farmhouse or an apartment, or the interior of an interior. A woman we have not yet seen is practically mid-narration, telling us something for which we have no context. It feels wrong, off-putting. Something is not right. This is not how movies are supposed to work. Finally we see the woman, played brilliantly by Jessie Buckley. She is standing on the street as puffy snowflakes start to fall, like we’re within a 3-D snow globe with her. She looks up at a window a couple stories up. We see an old man looking down out of a window. We see Jesse Plemons looking down out of a window. We see Jesse Plemmons in the next shot picking up Jessie Buckley in his worn car. The movie music twinkles and swirls. Jessie Buckley’s Lucy or Lucia or Amy is thinking of ending things with Jesse’s Jake. Things aren’t going to go anywhere good, seems to be the reasoning. Jake drives the car and sometimes talks; his behaviors seem fairly consistent until they’re not, until some gesture boils up like a foreign object from another self. Louisa or Lucy is forthcoming, a fountain of personality and knowledge and interests. But sometimes she slows to a trickle, or is quiet, and suddenly she is someone else who is the same person but perhaps with different memories, different interests. Sometimes she is a painter, sometimes a physicist, sometimes neither. Jessie and Jesse are great. Their performances and their characters are hard to describe. The best movie of 2020 is terrible at being a “movie.” It does not subscribe to common patterns, rhythms, or tropes. It doesn’t even try to be a great movie, really, it simply tries to dissect the life of the mind of the other, and to do that by any cinematic means possible. The self-awareness of the film could have been unbearable, except awareness (and our fragmentary experience of it) is so entirely the point of everything that the film is wrapped up within and that is wrapped up within it. To say the film accepts both the beauty and ugliness of life would be a platitude that the film itself rejects. To say that “love conquers all,” even moreso. But these false truths flit in and about the film’s peripheral vision: illusions or ghosts, but welcome ones. — _Chad Betz_

The smart speaker market continues to boom in this AI-driven world owing to the utilitarian nature of virtual assistant integrated speakers, which make daily life easier by handling small but inevitable tasks smartly and efficiently.      Moreover, the adoption rate of smart speakers has rapidly increased amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic due to shelter-in-place restrictions, which have led several house-arrested people throughout the world to tap on news content, important information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, music content and other entertainment stuff just via voice commands.      Additionally, the growing proliferation of virtual assistants and improving AI skills are aiding these speakers to become more advanced with each passing day, which is further increasing their adoption rate in this fast-paced world.      Further, increasing penetration rate of Internet usage and the emergence of 5G technology are continuously aiding growth of the market for these speakers.

“These are significant commitments,” Gov. Carney said of the state’s plan to use the funding. “We thank our congressional delegation, Sen. (Tom) Carper, Sen. (Chris) Coons and Congresswoman (Lisa) Blunt Rochester for their support of the CARES Act. For the next relief package that is still being worked on, we’re hopeful they’re able to push something over the goal line, although it looks a little uncertain at the moment.”      The second-most money went to the state’s child care assistance program with $128,055,262. Gov. Carney said this will help child care centers moving into the fall to provide backup support for children who are not in school.      Delaware’s Relief Grants Program was next on the list, receiving $100 million. The program, which is a joint initiative from the state and New Castle County, seeks to “give Delaware small businesses and nonprofits access to funds to cover expenses and provide relief related to COVID-19.”      The second round of applications for this program opened today. There will be a third and final round of applications in early November.      Gov. Carney said the state received 1,645 applications in the first round, with $54.4 million of the $100 million available this round. More than half the applicants were minority or women-owned businesses.      Of the businesses and nonprofits that applied, 75% had annual revenues under $1 million and 44% were under $250,000, while 75% of applicants have fewer than 10 employees and more than half of applicants have fewer than five.      Two-thirds of the dollar amount was accounted for by “disproportionately impacted industries,” such as food services, retail and personal care.      “I’ve said all along that some businesses have sacrificed more than others,” Gov. Carney said.      The state has also used $80 million from the CARES Act on COVID-19 testing, and that figure could increase, Gov. Carney said.      The rest of the breakdown of how the state is using its CARES Act funding is:   • $22 million for state agency pandemic-related expenditures.   • $20 million for broadband infrastructure.   • $20 million for the Community Provider Relief Fund.   • $15 million for Delaware State Housing Authority rent/utility assistance.   • $12 million for the COVID-19 contact tracing program.   • $10 million for the Rapid Workforce Training and Redevelopment Initiative.   • $7.2 million for HELP small business loans.   • $4 million for school-aged child care programs.   • $2.7 million for poultry-grower support.   • $2 million for local government allocations outside of New Castle County.   • $800,000 for public school transportation.

_The Platform_ benefits immensely from the strength of its simple, high- concept premise and all the superfluous information that is withheld from the viewer. It doesn’t matter that we don’t know _why_ exactly people are placed into this diabolical, vertical prison structure, in which the only sustenance arrives once a day in the form of a steadily descending, increasingly gross stone slab piled high with perishables. Nor do we really need to know how this apparent social experiment operates, although the repeated glimpses we get at cooks slaving over perfect dishes to be sent down to the doomed convicts is no doubt designed to needle at our curiosity. What matters is that we observe the differences in human reaction to this plight—the ways that different personalities react to adversity with an “us or them” mentality, or a predatory hunger, or a spontaneous drive toward self-sacrificing altruism. The fact that the position of the prisoners is constantly in flux is key—it gives them both a tangible reason to _be_ the change they want to see in their world, and an almost impossible temptation to do the exact opposite out of distrust of their neighbors. One expects a nihilistic streak here, and you won’t be disappointed—but there’s a few glimmers of hope shining through the cracks as well. Just enough, perhaps, to twist the knife that much deeper. — _Jim Vorel_

For centuries, empires have relied on military might to invade and occupy foreign lands. China has taken a different approach to expand its footprint across the globe: investment.

In the 21st century, the Chinese government has metastasized into a top national security threat for countries worldwide. Is it dangerous to become beholden to China and its promise of riches?

The 2.7% drop in incomes reflected a huge 14.8% decline in the category that covers government payments including unemployment benefits. Democrats and Republicans have been unable to restore the expired benefits because of wide differences between the two sides on how much additional support to provide.


  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held talks Wednesday about a massive COVID-19 rescue package, meeting face to face for the first time in more than a month in a last-ditch effort to seal a tentative accord on an additional round of coronavirus relief.


  At issue is a long-delayed package that would extend another round of $1,200 direct stimulus payments, restore bonus pandemic jobless benefits, speed aid to schools and extend assistance to airlines, restaurants and other struggling businesses. A landmark $2 trillion relief bill in March passed with sweeping support and is credited with helping the economy through the spring and summer.


  The 1% rise in consumer spending was driven by a 1.4% gain in spending on services with big gains coming for spending on food services and hotel and motel accommodations, two areas that were hit hard during the lockdowns. Spending on goods durable goods such as autos was up 0.9% in August while spending on nondurable goods such as food and clothing fell 0.1%.


  Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for 70% of economic activity in the U.S.


  Economists believe GDP growth, which fell at a record annual rate of 31.4% in the April-June quarter will rebound by a record amount in the July-September quarter but could face a severe slowdown in the current quarter in the absence of further government help.

_They’re heeeeeeeeeere…_ Steven Spielberg’s first big success in the producer’s chair (and notionally directed by Tobe Hooper) was released concurrently with _ET: The Extraterrestrial_ and could arguably be seen as the dark side of a dyad about alienation in suburbia. Nonetheless, it retains the Spielberg Feel Good Stamp even as a horror film. The Freelings are a “typical” unassuming middle class family living in a peaceful suburb that becomes not- so-peaceful as the house is caught in the grip of supernatural disturbances. The pet canary dies. There are bizarre weather events. Youngest-kid Carol Ann (Heather O’Rourke) stands entranced in front of the TV in one of the most iconic moments in horror film history, lit by a mysterious beam of green light while the room begins to shake. As Carol Ann is repeatedly drawn to the television, where she begins to talk to “the TV people,” and eventually gets sucked into a dimensional vortex in the closet, father Steve (Craig T. Nelson) consults parapsychologist Dr. Lesh (Beatrice Straight). Lesh finds she’s in over her head and calls for an exorcist. The anatomization of the “happy family” is lavishly paced, making the ensuing horror all the more vivid. Not the deepest movie ever made, certainly, but an enduring classic of the genre, a highly detailed take on the “unassuming regular-Joe family savaged by invisible menace” trope, and still pretty damn creepy. _—Amy Glynn_

The less you know about Karyn Kusama’s _The Invitation_ , the better. This is true of slow-burn cinema of any stripe, but Kusama slow-burns to perfection. The key, it seems, to successful slow-burning in narrative fiction is the narrative rather than the actual slow-burn. In the case of _The Invitation_ , that involves a tale of deep and intimate heartache, the kind that none of us hopes to ever have to endure in our own lives. The film taps into a nightmare vein of real-life dread, of loss so profound and pervasive that it fundamentally changes who you are as a human being. That’s where we begin: with an examination of grief. It’s remarkable for its foundation, for all of the substantive storytelling infrastructure that Kusama builds the film upon in the first place. The film starts in earnest as Will (Logan Marshall-Green in top form) arrives at a dinner party his ex-wife, Eden (Tammy Blanchard), is throwing at what once was their house. He has brought his girlfriend, Kira (Emayatzy Corinealdi), along with him. But something is undeniably off at Eden’s place, and because Will is the lens through which Kusama’s audience engages with the film, we cannot tell what that something is. There is oh so much more to be said about _The Invitation_ , especially its climax, where all is revealed and we see Will’s fears and Eden’s spiritual affirmations for what they are. Until then you’ll remain on tenterhooks, but to Kusama, jitters and thrills are sensations worth savoring. Where we end is obviously best left unsaid, but _The Invitation_ is remarkable neither for its ending nor for the direction we take to arrive at its ending. Instead, it is remarkable for its foundation, for all of the substantive storytelling infrastructure that Kusama builds the film upon in the first place. _—Andy Crump_

The _Child’s Play_ series has managed the supremely rare accomplishment of actually improving itself in its direct-to-video era, clawing its way up from the abyss that was the _Seed of Chucky_ days with its last two installments, _Curse_ and _Cult of Chucky_. This latest, the seventh in the series, is possibly the best since _Child’s Play 2_ , weaving together a complex web of characters from the history of the series. The voodoo mumbo-jumbo at the heart of the plot has gotten more fiendishly complicated than ever, resulting in not one but a small army of Chucky dolls, each containing the soul of Brad Dourif’s iconic serial killer, Charles Lee Ray. Stark and futuristic-feeling, the film is set in a brilliantly white-toned mental health institution, where recovering hero Nica (Dourif’s daughter, Fiona Dourif) must grapple with the legacy of Chucky, while also bringing original hero Andy Barclay back into the fold. This _Chucky_ is certainly a return to the original film in many respects, especially in its depraved attitude and copious amounts of gore. And unlike _Curse of Chucky_ , most of the FX are rendered practically, to boot. Ultimately, _Cult_ is a far better entry than you could ever hope for in the seventh film of a horror franchise, and it should be commended for that.

  WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - U.S. traffic deaths fell during the coronavirus lockdowns but drivers engaged in riskier behavior as the fatality rate spiked to its highest level in 15 years, a government report set to be released Thursday will show.


  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) found the fatality rate jumped to 1.42 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in the three months ending June 30, the highest since 2005.


  At the same time, overall traffic deaths fell by 3.3% to 8,870 while U.S. driving fell by about 26%, or 302 fewer over the same period in 2019, according to the report reviewed by Reuters. NHTSA's study showed "drivers who remained on the roads engaged in more risky behavior, including speeding, failing to wear seat belts, and driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol." By contrast, the fatality rate for 2019 was just 1.10 deaths per 100 million miles, the lowest rate since 2014 as traffic deaths fell by 2% to 36,096.


  Traffic data showed average speeds increased and extreme speeding became more common. Data from some states suggested that fewer people were wearing seat belts during the lockdown.


  "In short, the stay-at-home orders may have led the population of drivers during the height of the health crisis to have been smaller but more willing to take risks," NHTSA found.


  NHTSA also noted that in the wake of the outbreak enforcement of some traffic laws was reduced. "It is possible that drivers´ perception that they may be caught breaking a law was reduced," the report found.


  NHTSA also said that since coronavirus risks are higher for older Americans, that could have minimized driving by more risk-averse drivers.

You will certainly have no trouble finding ardent supporters of _Session 9_ as an “overlooked gem” of a horror movie, if you dig into the online world of horror fandom. It’s often mentioned alongside the likes of _Lake Mungo_ as an indie psychological/supernatural film that achieves a lot on a shoestring budget, but it’s also not without its faults and narrative inconsistencies. Its plot revolves around a team of asbestos removers who are clearing out an abandoned insane asylum, which might lead you to believe you know where the story is headed—rest assured, you do not. This is not a typical haunted house feature, filled to the gills with apparitions and jump-scares. Instead it’s a mind-bending, often confusing psychological thriller that is constantly asking the audience to reconsider the nature of reality and a possibly unreliable viewpoint character.

WISEMAN: The institution is also just an excuse to observe human behavior in somewhat defined conditions. The films are as much about that as they are about institutions. For most of the films, all the encounters take place within a relatively limited geographical framework. Sometimes it's just a building or in the case of "Boxing Gym," a couple of rooms. In the case of "National Gallery," it's a big building. In the case of "Public Housing," it was a housing project. Anything that takes place within the geographic boundaries of the institution is fair game to include in the film. Anything that takes place outside those boundaries is another film.

Brighton boss Graham Potter is eager to get the focus back on “boring stuff” like coaching and developing players once the international transfer window shuts on Monday.
 The Seagulls secured the services of Adam Lallana and Joel Veltman in July while defender Tariq Lamptey joined in January, but they continue to be linked with a move for a striker ahead of Saturday’s trip to Everton.
 Despite good displays in the Premier League and Carabao Cup this season, Brighton have missed a number of chances and yet Potter is relaxed about the attacking options available to him before deadline day on Monday.
 “I think it wasn’t so long back we were talking about football maybe resetting in the middle of the (coronavirus) pandemic and that seems to have gone out the window and now everyone is asking who you want to sign,” said Potter.
 “We have done some good business in the last couple of windows, to add different players to the group and sometimes you have to let them settle and let them perform, grow and take their game to the next level.
 “Unfortunately that is not interesting, especially when you have transfer window shows on. People don’t want to hear about this boring stuff where you help people improve.
 “They want to hear about who you will sign and the external solution – 15 minutes of fame, Britain’s Got Talent that type of stuff. We want the easy fix and we don’t want to hear about the other stuff.
 “There is only a few days left and then maybe we can get back to talking about coaching and developing players, that would be fun.”
 One of Brighton’s star performers this season has been full-back Lamptey, who moved to the south coast at the start of 2020.
 After a lack of opportunities at Chelsea, the defender has flourished at his new club and this week it resulted in talk Champions League holders Bayern Munich had registered an interest.
 Potter insisted: “Firstly I don’t know and I am not aware of any interest or rumours.
 “Again it is another joyous part of the transfer window because all of a sudden these stories come out and it becomes the truth and you have to answer on these false stories.
 “But the performances are down to him and his attributes, quality and personality. He has not been with us long but he has made a real impact in terms of how he is around the place.
 “Everyone loves him, he is a great kid and he has a bright future. The short, medium and long-term future is hopefully with us.”
 If Lamptey continues his upward trajectory, the next milestone to tick off could be an England call-up.
 Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate spoke of how strong displays at the beginning of the campaign were the reason behind Everton’s Dominic Calvert- Lewin being part of the squad for the first time this month.
 Before the Toffees striker links up with England, he will face Brighton at Goodison Park and attempt to add to his eight goals this season.
 “Firstly congratulations to him for that, well deserved. I think he has taken his game onto another level,” Potter said of Calvert-Lewin.
 “You could always see the quality, but I think he has taken that step forward and obviously goals and confidence help.
 “He is a striker that has everything in terms of being able to run in behind, offer someone to go into and can score. He deserves his call-up and hopefully he is celebrating a lot and doesn’t play so well on Saturday.”

Privacy and civil rights groups want some answers from Amazon over election security, or the lack of it.


  That came in a letter condemning the company for election security failures and seeking more transparency about how they have responded to breaches of election data.


  That followed a report from Reuters that voter information stored by Amazon in the cloud had been breached multiple times, breaches they argue could be weaponized to manipulate the 2020 election.


  Related: DOJ Says Amazon Employees Bribed to Provide Competitive Advantage


  "Amazon needs to be transparent about their response to these breaches, so the public can evaluate the security of the election system and the steps Amazon is taking," they said.


  They conceded that Amazon maintains the infrastructure and it is up to customers to secure their data, but they add that the election system is not an everyday customer.


  "If a car seat manufacturer didn’t provide proper instructions to make sure people installed their car seats correctly, and it put infants in harm’s way, people would blame the manufacturer for its negligence," they said. "It’s reasonable to expect a corporation the size of Amazon, handling contracts for the government, to devote resources to ensuring those accounts are safe."


  Among those signing on to the letter included Demand Progress, Color of Change, and Fight for the Future.


  "Amazon provides election services for more than 40 states," said Fight for the Future executive director Evan Greer. "With the election weeks away, we still don't know the extent of the breaches of election data or whether the issues reported have even been addressed by Amazon," Greer said.


  The letter was released the same day that the Senate voted to compel other Big Tech companies--Google, Facebook, Twitter--to testify over issues including election security and data protection.

RIDGE MANOR, Fla. (AP) - A woman who won $1,000 in a second chance drawing on July 29 isn't getting her prize because the certified letter she sent to the Florida Lottery's headquarters never arrived.


  Sue Burgess told WFLA that officials in Tallahassee told her "no ticket, no prize."


  The second chance lottery prize gives winners limited time to turn in a ticket to claim the prize. Their options are to either put the ticket in a drop box at a local lottery office, which were not then open to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic, or mail them to the headquarters.


  Burgess told the television station she felt it would be safer to send the ticket via certified mail with the U.S. Postal Service.


  The tracking information shows the ticket arrived at a Tallahassee post office at 7:12 a.m. on Aug. 12. But the online tracking shows the ticket was never delivered to the lottery office.


  When Burgess called, lottery officials told her that without a ticket, the prize would go to an alternate winner.


  In a second chance game, the lottery has a record of winners because players register their names and contact information. Burgess told the station she was notified she won by a lottery official who called to give her the good news.


  Typically, lottery winners of more than $600 can submit winning tickets in person at their local lottery office. But because of COVID-19, offices were closed to the public. Burgess says she was told she could send the ticket via certified mail or leave the ticket in a drop box at a local lottery office.


  Burgess said there was a one-week time frame to submit the ticket, but she missed an email about being a winner and by the time the office called her, she only had days to get the ticket post-marked.


  "That´s why you chose certified mail," Burgess told the station. "With COVID, I understand the mail is a little bit slow. But for safety sake, certified mail usually has priority."


  Lottery officials told WFLA the claim was never received at the headquarters.


  The claims department told Burgess to contact the postal service to find out what happened to the letter. The postal service said they are investigating what happened.


  In a statement to the station, the postal service offered an apology to Burgess for any "inconvenience."


  If the package arrives, lottery officials told the station they would bend the rules and pay Burgess the $1,000 if it was postmarked by the original deadline.


  "Ms. Burgess´ situation is an unusual circumstance and, to our knowledge, no other winner has experienced a similar issue," the lottery said.

At its core, there's a pretty familiar midlife crisis plucked from the advice columns underlying it all -- Has the magic left our marriage? -- that Jones nicely captures, while confronting her father both regarding his past and his slightly Neanderthal-like ways, at one point asking, "Who has a travel agent anymore?"


  "On the Rocks" also serves as a sort-of love letter to New York City, in the way Woody Allen's older movies were, which becomes oddly timely after the painful stretch the city endured during the height of the coronavirus outbreak.


  The film is receiving a few-week release in theaters, where it likely would have struggled in any event, before landing in the more comfortable confines of Apple TV+. However and wherever it's seen, "On the Rocks" is worth the time, if only for the warmth the movie exhibits toward its throwback leading man, and its vision of the town that his character cheerfully owns.


  "On the Rocks" premieres Oct. 2 in theaters and Oct. 23 on Apple TV+. It's rated R.

In a "Lost in Translation" reunion, writer-director Sofia Coppola lets Bill Murray let loose in "On the Rocks," an entertaining, wonderfully simple comedy with the qualities of a smooth martini -- it goes down easy, but delivers a bit of kick.


  Murray's presence takes a while to kick in, as the story begins with his daughter, Laura (Rashida Jones), who is understandably harried and stressed. She's trying to write a book and tend to a pair of young children, while her husband Dean (Marlon Wayans) is increasingly absent, traveling a lot for a new business venture he's working to establish.


  It all seems pretty idyllic until Laura drops by one of Dean's work events, and notices the attractive coworker (Jessica Henwick) with whom her husband has been spending a lot of time. She then shares those suspicions with her dad, Murray's Felix, an unrepentant playboy -- and still a shameless flirt -- who immediately assumes the worst ("It's probably nothing, but..."), dragging a reluctant Laura into spy work to ascertain if her hubby is cheating on her.

WISEMAN: I've probably been more influenced by the books I've read than the movies I've seen. I've never consciously drawn on the work of another filmmaker while I'm shooting or editing. When I read a novel or read a poem, I think about the same kind of things that I do when I'm editing. When I went to college a long time ago, it was called close reading. It probably has a fancier name now. But we were taught to pay close attention to the text and not incorporate in our analysis of the text anything outside of it. In other words, we weren't encouraged to read a biography of Ernest Hemingway to read "The Sun Also Rises." So I learned how to pay close attention. So when I'm shooting and in particular when I'm editing, in order to make a film out of 150 hours of rushes, I have to pay close attention to what people are saying and doing and how they're moving and how they're dressed and the language they're using. I have to explain the behavior that I'm seeing and hearing to myself in order to make a judgment. The making of these films involves an effort to be aware, in a sense to be awake.

Further, this Zacks Rank #3 company’s partnership with Starbucks — which allows China-based customers to order Starbucks’ beverages and food via Tmall Genie — is contributing well to the adoption rate of the smart speaker.      Meanwhile, Baidu — carrying a Zacks Rank #3 at present — is gaining from the robust AI platform called DuerOS, which is likely to continue aiding the adoption rate of smart speakers.
