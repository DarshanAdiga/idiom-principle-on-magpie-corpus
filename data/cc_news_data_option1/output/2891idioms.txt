Brown announced in an email to the BU community July 1 the formation of a committee that would advise him in deciding whether the nickname Rhett, which holds ties to a racist character in “Gone With the Wind,” should be retired.

“As President Brown noted, a committee member’s personal convictions do not necessarily impact their ability to serve,” Cella wrote. “As a result, it is difficult not to feel gaslighted by the President’s decision. I am disheartened, to say the least.”

“When we constitute a committee our hope is that it will be deliberative, i.e., that all committee members participate with a willingness to listen and consider arguments,” Brown wrote. “Based on your stated position, which I respect, I believe it is best that we recuse you from this service and recruit a new nominee.”

As the Cleveland Indians, Washington Redskins and several U.S. high schools currently look into their own mascot name changes in light of ongoing conversations on racism, Cella said he believes BU has a “moral obligation” to change Rhett’s name.
