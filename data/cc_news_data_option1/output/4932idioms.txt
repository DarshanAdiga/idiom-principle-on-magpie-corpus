Thanks Mike. It’s Ernie. Thanks for the question. You're spot on. We're seeing an increase in both service transactions and sales through our digital channel and we're also seeing a return back to slightly normal levels in reality in the branch network. But that said, we're constantly looking at the footprint and saying, are there opportunities for us to pull back to create a different operating model, whether they be our service capabilities? So that is what we're looking at and we'll continue to focus on as COVID ebbs and flows we're managing that accordingly now.

Next it explored a range of routes for the brand and packaging, all looking at how it could evolve the branding to be more of today without alienating loyalists, as well as setting up a packaging architecture to create a stronger and more confident branded presence on shelf. The agency then continued to refine the chosen direction, redrawing the camel icon, reviewing typeface, introducing the "Established 1974" underline along with "nut connoisseurs" and tackling the full brand packaging strategy across a number of ranges and products. After that, it captured the full brand world and principles for application on and off pack in a comprehensive set of guidelines.

Sure, thanks you’re talking about basically our NIM, which was really quite good, really during the quarter end and frankly for the year, better than a couple of things that cause that much better deposit growth than we had seen in the past, better loan spreads, frankly, than we had seen as we've been -- we've tried to be very disciplined, but continue to support clients. And then, the offset is just the lower rates, but we did pretty well to offset that this quarter. And I think to your question going forward, I don't see a big change. Over time, we may see some deposits leak away as they actually get back into investing in businesses with our clients. But I don't see a big change as we go through the year.

Unfortunately, due to her fame, her love life gets much more attention than necessary, but this album proves that at the end of the day, Kehlani loves with a heart just like ours.- _W.O._

OCTOBER 24, 1939-NOVEMBER 23, 2020      Born and raised in the small town of Gorham, NH, in the foothills of the White Mountains, Peter attended the local public schools where he was a dedicated student. He played basketball in a gym he described as "so tiny, the painted circle around the foul line nearly intersected with the circle at center court."      Growing up, he worked a variety of jobs including manually setting pins at the bowling alley and working at the town gas station. He recalls installing a seatbelt for Carroll Shelby, so he could participate in the Mt. Washington Hillclimb Auto Race. When he was older, he worked summers as a pole man for the Brown Paper Company on the Androscoggin River, standing on pilings in the middle of the river and sorting logs as they floated towards the mill.      When he graduated from Gorham High School with his class of twenty-four students, he received a scholarship to the University of New Hampshire where he studied engineering and business. UNH is also where he met Phebe, his wife of 59 years.      One summer, he worked as a civil engineer in Los Angeles, helping survey Dodger Stadium and the Hollywood Walk of Stars. The next year, he surveyed for the California Forest Service using pack horses to carry their gear into remote forest areas near Bakersfield, CA. At one point, his group had to stop what they were doing and assist a team of smoke jumpers fight a forest fire in Sequoia National Park.      Upon graduating from UNH, Pete enlisted in the Navy, attending OCS in Newport, Rhode Island, a location that became a family favorite. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant JG and proudly served aboard the USS Warrington, a destroyer that helped patrol the waters off the coast of Florida, monitoring the activity of Russian submarines during the Cuban Missile Crisis.      After the Navy, Pete returned to New Hampshire to get his MBA from Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business. Between years at Tuck, he worked for the Gillette Company. Upon graduating, he joined the duMont Corporation, an industrial cutting tool company in Greenfield, MA, where he worked his way up to president and owner until his retirement in 2000.      Pete was an avid volunteer, serving the Franklin Country area as a Little League coach, and a member of the school board. He also served on boards for the local YMCA, the Franklin Savings Bank, the Bay State Franklin Medical Center, and Bay State Health Systems.      He was a lifelong fan of New England sports teams, enjoyed history, and traveled the world with his family. Pete was a loving and devoted husband and loyal friend who could fill a room with his laugh.      The son of Harry and Mary Fitzpatrick Elliott, Pete is survived by his wife, Phebe Sherman Elliott; his sisters, Susan Schwarz, and Joyce (Tom) Carne; son Thomas (wife Stephanie), and daughter Elizabeth (husband Kevin McKelvey). He was a proud, loving Gumpa to Peter Elliott, William Elliott, Phebe McKelvey and Tim McKelvey.      Due to Covid, the family will have a private memorial service at the Sarasota National Cemetery.

Sure, thanks for the question, Paul. It's Pat. I guess first of all, we're definitely encouraged by what we saw last night and look forward to working with the government on organizing the details of that program. I would say definitely a positive, although it's the -- at the moment where we're seeing as loan size is capped at $1 million, which will be primarily beneficial for the Small Business segment. I think pretty obvious to say that there are definitely stress sectors that they're focused on, hotels, restaurants, entertainment and leisure. So we think the government is spot on with the targeted approach that they're taking.

Well, yes, but to the extent that your loans are down, there wouldn't be as much in fees there. So I think we've worked through that. So I think the point you're making is positive, and it's maybe in spite of lower loans than we've had in the past. So just more of as loans continue to grow, and start growing again, I think that's just more positive down the road.

Although any reading above 50 indicates expanding conditions, the index fell to a three-month low. In September, the index had reached an almost two-year- high in September.,
 Business conditions still haven’t returned to normal, however. The high index reading in the past several months mostly reflects a recovery getting underway after a massive slump early in the pandemic.
 The Chicago PMI is the last of the regional manufacturing indices before the national ISM factory data for November is released on Tuesday. Other regional manufacturing surveys showed mixed results in November.
 Most manufacturers have managed to resume full operations. They’ve implemented new procedures to safeguard employees and customers and have not been affected much by fresh government restrictions put in place after record coronavirus outbreak.
 They remain susceptible to a broader slowdown in the U.S. and global economies if the viral outbreak gets much worse, however. Exports still haven’t returned to the precrisis peak, for instance.

The third-quarter GDP was certainly an improvement, to say the least, from the record-setting second-quarter collapse. GDP increased 33% according to the estimate published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This surge in value can be largely attributed to the continual reopening of businesses across the country, and increases in personal consumption expenditures (PCE), where motor vehicles and parts led for goods sold. In addition, exports were also led by automotive vehicles, engines, and parts.

Trading in the Nasdaq was exhibiting panic-like-buying behavior Monday late morning, even as the broader market softened in the last trading session of November. The Nasdaq Composite undefined was sinking 0.8% at 12,111, while the Nasdaq Arms Index, a volume-weighted breadth measure, fell to 0.322. Many on Wall Street see declines below 0.500 as suggesting panic buying. The Arms Index is calculated by dividing the ratio of the number of advancing stocks over decliners by the ratio of the volume of advancing stocks over declining volume. As the stock market rises, the Arms often falls below 1.000, as the buyers rush into advancing stocks. The current dynamic suggests that investors may continue to adhere to a trend of buying large-capitalization technology- related names as a haven proxy in times of uncertainty. The number of stocks declining on the Nasdaq on Monday outnumbered advancers by nearly 2.4 to 1, but volume in advancing stocks represented 56% of total volume on the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average undefined was down over 400 points, or 1.4%, at 29,502, while the S&P 500 index undefined was trading 0.9% lower at around 3,605. Despite, the declines, the Dow may still register is bet monthly gain since 1987, while both the Dow and S&P 500 were aiming for their best Novembers since 1928.
