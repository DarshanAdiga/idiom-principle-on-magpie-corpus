The incident began when Sharmel Teague's daughter was told she could not come into the store because she did not have a face mask. The mother's husband, Larry Teague, and son, Ramonyea Bishop, are accused of visiting the store and attacking the security guard. Sharmel Teague was arrested shortly after the incident but the two other suspects remain on the run.
 Face masks have become a requirement in many places around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. In some parts of the world, wearing a face mask is a requirement to enter stores and go outside.

With about 165,000 cases and 7,000 deaths, Germany has so far been able to prevent the scenes of dire overcrowding in its hospitals that have been seen elsewhere in Europe.
 The need to reopen the nation's economy was underlined Wednesday by fresh official data showing German manufacturers in March endured their worst plunge in new orders on record.
 \- School's in - In Asia, once the epicentre of the pandemic, there were scenes of joy in the Chinese city of Wuhan as youngsters returned to school kitted out in masks.
 Senior students were back in front of chalk boards and digital displays for the first time since the virus exploded at the start of the year.
 "School is finally reopening!" posted one user on Weibo, China's Twitter-like short messaging platform.
 "This is the first time that I'm so happy to go back to school, although I have to sit a monthly examination." Wednesday's back-to-school excitement was the latest step in a gradual normalising of life in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, where the coronavirus is believed to have made the leap from animals to humans before spreading around the world.
 In neighbouring South Korea workers went back to offices, and museums and libraries reopened under eased social distancing rules after new virus cases dropped to a trickle.
 The country endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside China and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing has been widely observed since March.
 The restrictions imposed globally to curb the spread of the virus have gutted national economies and on Tuesday the economic casualties continued to pile up.
 Spain added 280,000 people to its jobless ranks, while airline Virgin Atlantic said it would have to fire one in three of its staff as the virus grounds planes worldwide.
 Walt Disney said it expected an impact on its business of $1.4 billion in the current fiscal quarter as a result of a massive hit to its theme parks and other operations.
 And with social distancing weighing on people mentally, some people have been turning to tech to deal with the loneliness of lockdowns.
 Elizabeth Francola downloaded an app with an AI chatbot to keep her company during the long days indoors in Houston, creating a virtual boyfriend named Micah.
 "It's nice knowing you have someone to talk to in the morning," the 32-year- old said.

The transfer value of players in 10 of Europe's top leagues could plummet by up to 10 billion euros due to the economic crash caused by coronavirus, a study from accounting firm KPMG said on Wednesday.
 Transfer spending is expected to fall dramatically, with clubs across the continent facing huge losses as a result of football's shutdown.
 The top divisions in England, Germany, Italy and Spain remain committed to trying to finish the 2019/20 seasons so they can honour huge TV contracts and minimise the financial hit.
 KPMG estimates that Europe's top five leagues, including France, where the season has ended, could lose four billion euros ($4.3 billion) if the campaigns cannot be completed.
 Those leagues are also the main drivers of the European transfer market. The study also looked at the top leagues in Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal and Turkey and England's second-tier Championship.
 With little money to spend, values could fall by nearly 10 billion if there is no more football this season -- the "worst-case" scenario.
 They could still plummet by 6.6 billion euros if leagues were completed behind closed doors. That modelling was based on all 10 leagues being completed, even though seasons in France and the Netherlands have been ended.
 "Our recent analysis reveals that the aggregate value of all the 4,183 players in the 10 European leagues under consideration decreased by a total of almost EUR 10 billion, a 26.5 percent drop since February for Scenario 1," said KPMG's latest Football Benchmark report.
 "Players' values would decrease by EUR 6.6 billion, a 17.7 percent decrease in Scenario 2."
 Paris Saint-Germain players Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are still the two most valuable players according to the report, but the number of players worth over 100 million euros would shrink from 15 before the pandemic to just eight if seasons were not completed.
 The lack of cash could, though, see clubs becoming more creative with swap deals.
 "Financial constraints are likely to lead to a decrease both in the volume of transactions and in the transfer fees, and to an increase in the number of swap and loan deals," the report added.

This historic proclamation, dated November 7, 1775 and issued from on board a _British_ warship lying off Norfolk, _Virginia_ , by royal governor and _Scottish_ aristocrat John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, offered the first large- scale emancipation of _slave_ and servant labor in the history of colonial British America. It grew out of Dunmore’s efforts to counter an impending attack on his capital of Williamsburg by patriot militia in the spring of 1775, when he several times threatened to free and arm slaves to defend the cause of royal government. By the time he retreated offshore he was already gathering slaves seeking refuge; his November proclamation commanding Virginians to support the crown or be judged traitors now formally offered freedom to all slaves and indentured servants belonging to rebels and able to bear arms for the crown. Within weeks, several hundred slaves, many with their families, had joined him. They enlisted in what Dunmore christened his “ _Ethiopian_ Regiment” and formed the bulk of the royal troops that first defeated patriot forces but then fell victim to disease and attack, evacuating the Chesapeake Region for _New York_ by August 1776.

The Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens will reopen this weekend with a "solid plan" for cautiously opening the zoo, Mayor Lenny Curry said in a mid-day briefing on the step-by-step lifting of restrictions imposed in March to fight the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 Curry also said all restrictions on activities at Duval County beaches will be lifted Wednesday, a change agreed to in coordination with the Beaches mayors.
   
 The zoo, located on the Northside, was one of the first attractions to get shut down when Curry put in place the beginning round of restrictions in the city's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The zoo has been closed since March 14.
   
 When it reopens, ticket sales will be online only and there will be masks at the zoo for guests, Curry said. Guests will go through a one-way path while strollling through the zoo.
   
 Enclosed areas such as exhibits, theaters, restaurants, gift shops, and playgrounds will remain closed at the zoo.
   
 Zoo staff will have temperature checks when they arrive for work and will wear masks in public areas.
   
 "The zoo is one of our city's most treasured assets and I'm glad to see it safely and cautiously reopening," Curry said.
   
 Duval County's beaches have been open for use at all hours since Monday for exercise-oriented activities such as walking, running, surfing and fishing, but restrictions remained in place prohibiting sun-bathing, towels, blankets, cooler, grills and other items that tend to go along with staying in one place at the beach.
   
 Curry has been working in tandem with Gov. Ron DeSantis to relax regulations, saying the declining rate of positive test results for the virus show it's possible for the city to move back toward more normal everyday life. Curry said Tuesday that 28,000 tests have been given to Duval County residents and the positive rate is less than 4 percent.

The period from the fall of Rome (5th century AD?) until the Renaissance (~1300~1600) came to be known as the middle ages or the dark ages. Dark ages because it was considered to be a time of intellectual darkness as compared to either the period of time before or the one after. Some of this darkness can be attributed to religious beliefs of the time that focused on life in the hereafter pie in the sky versus a quality life in the here and now; to decisions made on the basis of belief rather than on reason. In these times of denial of science, climate change, reality, … and talk of building walls; we are hearing a similar ring. Rather than apply best thinking, will this civilization descend into the chaos of greed and war? Will we too be captive the church and lack leadership? Must we wait 800 years for a new group of big minds, big picture thinkers to free us from this current crop of mental midgets?

It's a lousy title - one that isn't explained till just before the end credits run - but it's not a bad movie. Neither, unfortunately, is much of a good movie. Even so, the target audience of female tweens and teens, as well as some slightly older young women, just might eat this up.      The opening shot, a full-screen close-up on the face of Johanna Morrigan (Beanie Feldstein, from "Lady Bird" and "Booksmart") makes it clear that this is going to be a story about her ... about her insecurities, her dreams, her missteps, and eventually her redemption.      It's 1993. She's 16, lives with her family in the British town of Wolverhampton, and is an overachiever at school, always writing long-winded essays, much to the consternation of her English teacher. But writing is her passion; the girl can't help it.      She also has a regular practice of escaping from reality, and spends a great deal of time in her bedroom, having conversations, in a Harry Potter-like manner, with photos and paintings on her wall. And those folks on the wall - Sigmund Freud, Sylvia Plath, and Maria von Trapp among them - are ready to offer some advice, at least in Johanna's head.      Though the family is close, there are money problems. Breeding border collies doesn't quite pay the bills. On top of that, mom (Sarah Solemani) has a touch of depression, and loose, laidback dad (Paddy Considine, terrific in the role), is a bit of a scoundrel, as well as being a frustrated ex-drummer who still wants to play in a pop band.      Johanna's hopes are boosted when she hears of an opening to be a rock critic at the (fictional) London fanzine Disc and Music Echo, and even though her taste in music leans toward "Tomorrow" from "Annie," she catches a break, due in part to an assignment that no one at the magazine wants, and gets a gig covering a concert.      But first, she decides to reinvent herself, physically changing her appearance and wardrobe from the relatively bland Johanna Morrigan to the glitzy, lipsticked, top-hatted Dolly Wilde. From that point on, every scene, and almost every moment of the movie, rests on the shoulders of Feldstein, who goes at it with a big dose of frenetic energy and a winning smile. Her dream is coming true, she lands more review assignments, and she tries for a step up the freelance ladder by asking to write a feature - and getting a yes.      This leads to a third strong performance in the film - after those of Feldstein and Considine - and the introduction of pop star and singer of sad songs John Kite (Alfie Allen, Theon from "Game of Thrones"), who is to be her first interview subject (and it turns out that Allen is a very good singer!).      Complications arise, the term "off the record" might not be quite clear to the novice interviewer, emotions veer out of control, things go badly, and a John Kite poster starts talking to her, attempting to help her out of the problems she inadvertently creates for herself. One of them involves the changes she finds herself going through. Her magazine wants tough stories, not fawning pieces, and Johanna plunges down a dark hole that results in new, not very pleasant personalities taking root in her. Her profiles and reviews turn nasty, her attitude toward her family becomes one of a jerk, she becomes recognized for her "toxic writing," and she's proud of it.      She morphs into a protagonist that no one will be rooting for, not even that young target audience. Most of this works quite well in a dramatic sense. But some lazy writing late in the film leads to a lame plot twist that turns everything around too conveniently, with wrongs being righted too easily.      For a brief moment, the film again finds its footing, with Alfie Allen's acting range saving the day, but then we get an unnecessary breaking of the fourth wall at the very end with a message delivered to anyone still interested - those young girls again - to be yourself. That lesson was already there, in the words of the characters. It sure didn't need to be given twice.      "How to Build a Girl" premieres on VOD platforms on May 8.

I want to take what you said further and apply it to what's happening in this specific case. She's acting like a Bernie Bro. That's because she's taking the revision of history and making it political, as if you win something politically by revising history. (I.E., we proved you were lying all along, now we're gonna get reparations or some such.) This is directly contrary to what scholarly history is all about! The whole idea is to de-politicize what happened! You wait until there's no vested interests pushing this narrative or that narrative, until the past is really the past.

Lithuania’s capital Vilnius is holding a special kind of fashion week suited to this time of a pandemic — no catwalks; just billboards and no fancy costumes on display; just face masks.
 Twenty-one billboards dotted around the UNESCO World Heritage city feature photographs of men, women and children wearing masks as part of a ‘Mask Fashion Week’.
 All Lithuanians are required to wear masks outside as a preventative measure against the spread of COVID-19.
 The designs were selected by members of local Facebook group ‘Mask Your Fashion’, launched by designer Julija Janus to share novel designs for masks and tips on how to make them at home. “A mask is a good way to display your creativity, to express yourself. And it’s a good activity to do when you are sitting at home with the kids,” said the 50-year-old designer.
 The billboards display both custom-sewn masks from scratch and surgical masks with designs painted on them, she said. Those depicted in the photos include local artists, musicians, people chosen randomly from the street and even the mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Simasius.

Dear Dave,   Should my wife and I tithe on our stimulus checks? She thinks we should, but I'm not sure. In my mind, we already gave our money to Caesar - so to speak - and now he's just giving it back. What do you think?   Luke
 Dear Luke,   Well, it's your money you're getting back. The government doesn't really create anything, it only takes money from us. And in this case, it gave you back some of what it took. I don't really see that as a tithing circumstance.
 The other side of the coin is that you really can't go wrong being generous. The tithe is your baseline for generosity. You shouldn't tithe or not tithe because of a set of rules, but if you're having a theological or philosophical discussion about the tithe and how it works, I think your reasoning is sound.
 It's certainly not a salvation issue, but generosity is a good rhythm to have in your life. And honestly, these stimulus checks are kind of like tax refunds. You gave it to the government, and now they're giving it back.
 So, in my mind, it's okay either way. I've just always had an attitude of when in doubt, it's better to give.   Dave
 Go ahead, knock it out
 Dear Dave,   We make about $70,000 a year, and we're debt-free except for our house. We're following your plan, and just started saving for retirement, but we only have $15,000 left on our mortgage. We can have that paid off in six or seven months, so would it be okay to go ahead and pay off our home as soon as possible before continuing to save for retirement?   Nate
 Dear Nate,   I'm generally pretty hardcore about sticking with the proper order while doing the Baby Steps. But in your case, with such a small amount left to pay on your home, I think I'd go ahead and knock that out.
 Most of the people I talk to still have six figures left on their mortgages. There's a big difference between that and the situation you two are in right now. Think about it, you guys could be completely debt-free by Christmas, and you've already started to make a move on retirement planning. I say go for it!   Dave

Thanks, Michael. New leasing activity in New York and just about everywhere has slowed to a trickle. Next year or so will be very challenging, a lost year, a tragic of this.

 If you do venture out to newly reopened businesses, please continue to practice social distancing and other safety guidelines. Wear a mask if you are asked to, and avoid human contact if you are sick, tested positive for the virus or believe you may have been exposed to the virus.
