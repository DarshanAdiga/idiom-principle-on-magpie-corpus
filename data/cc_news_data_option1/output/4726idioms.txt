Attorneys for the Trump campaign organization inside the Federal Building were arguing why the state and seven county election boards were arguing should not certify the results of the general election because voters across the state were not treated the same.

"SMOKE" traces the fascinating and complex legacy of marijuana in the Black community. Early usage was recreational in nature, but political and racial dynamics led to the criminalization of cannabis and eventually its prohibition. America's unjust war on drugs systematically targeted marijuana use in the Black community, resulting in racially disproportionate numbers of arrests and convictions. "SMOKE" features the voices of high-profile lawmakers, who are fighting to bring restorative justice to those incarcerated and others saddled with felony convictions. "SMOKE" also spotlights the tragic story of Corvain Cooper, a father who is serving a life sentence for selling marijuana in the same neighborhood where legal dispensaries now operate in the open.

Winter is the time when the birds have to really work for food, and with less mouths to feed, the chance of survival for those carrying over into the spring increases significantly.
 The turkeys in the northeastern counties can almost become nuisances. There have been years when we‚Äôve hunted deer up in that country we have seen several hundred turkeys feeding in the hay along with the cattle on some of the farms. Most farmers don‚Äôt mind helping out the wildlife, but when the birds are eating all their cattle feed, and pooping in it to boot, they‚Äôre ready to have the turkeys gone.
 That being said, there is plenty of public land in which to hunt turkeys in several of those counties, but during this time of year, especially if there‚Äôs been some snow in the higher elevations, the turkeys will move down into the private lands.
 Most of the time landowners are open to the idea of maybe thinning the turkey herds around their area if hunters ask politely and are extra safe around livestock and other property.
 Fall turkey hunting is different than spring turkey hunting. The birds are not as eager to come to calls, unless their flock has been broken up, and most fall birds are taken by hunters who spot and stalk the birds. For some reason, fall birds are a little less paranoid, and if you take it nice and slow you can often times get within shotgun range.
 If you are considering a wild turkey for the upcoming Thanksgiving feast, just know this, wild birds do not taste the same as farm-raised birds. I tell people all the time, they are not like a Butterball you buy at the local grocery store. A wild turkey‚Äôs diet is different and because they are out there trying to make a living every day, being in perpetual motion, they are not the big fat birds that you will get at the market.

Many states have laws that punish public officials for the unauthorized sharing of official information. Missouri, however, might be the only other state that criminalizes non-officials for obtaining or sharing information. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling in the 1971 Pentagon Papers case is only the most famous case affirming the First Amendment right to publish information even if obtained from a government source who violated a duty or law in dispensing it.
