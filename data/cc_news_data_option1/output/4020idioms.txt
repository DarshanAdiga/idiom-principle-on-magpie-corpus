WEYMOUTH - District 3 Councilor Ken DiFazio said a plan to convert a 113-year-old warehouse mill at 44 Wharf St. into an 84-unit apartment complex would be "a good fit" for the neighborhood.          "It should not deter from any of the surrounding homes and their living environment," he said. "It should not impact them. I think it will be a great plus for that area."          The board of zoning appeals approved two special permits on Sept. 30 for Quincy-based Heritage Companies to renovate the former Francer Manufacturing warehouse, located near Osprey Overlook Park and the Back River trail network.          The special permits are required because the multi-family residential complex will be built in a flood plain district and a historic mill overlay district.          Principle Planner Eric Schneider said the conservation commission is drafting an order of conditions for Heritage to heed before it proceeds with the building project.          "It (conditions) is based on the testimony at the last hearing," he said.          Heritage plans to connect an existing drainage system to a town culvert under Summer Street, according to project engineer Karlis Skulte.          Skulte previously said the commission has requested Heritage to install sump pumps and swale drains to ensure the project complies with the state's stormwater management requirements.          Apartment complex design plan          Heritage plans to renovate the warehouse into a four-story, 66-unit apartment complex under the town's historic mill overlay district zoning approved by Town Council Feb. 3.          The site plan includes removing a rear section of the warehouse and replacing it with a 7,000 square-foot area to accommodate 18 additional units.          DiFazio said the historic mill overlay district was created to allow the warehouse to be converted into a multi-residential complex.          "People who live there would be within walking distance of the MBTA commuter rail station Jackson Square and Osprey Overlook Park," he said. "When I think of the logistics of where this (apartment) building will be, I'm certain it won't have any detrimental effects on the neighbors. The building will be fine-looking, and I believe it is something Weymouth will be proud of. That is my hope."          DiFazio said he believes renovating the warehouse into multi-family residences would "help put Wharf Street on the map."          Heritage's blueprint includes 45 one-bedroom units and 39-two-bedroom dwellings altogether.          The design includes parking for 146 vehicles on the 155,276 square-foot parcel that borders Osprey Overlook Park.          According to Heritage's attorney, Edward Fleming, there will be 1.5 parking spaces for each one-bedroom unit and two lanes to accommodate every two-bedroom dwelling.          The parking spaces will be placed behind the building to enhance the neighborhood's appearance, according to project Skulte.          Heritage President Michael Kiley said he believes the multi-residential development would draw attention to the Wharf Street area.          "It is in a tucked-away area that a lot of people don't know about," he said.          Kiley said he hopes to have the construction of the apartment units completed during the spring of 2022.          "The weather will obviously play a big role with when we start," he said.

El presidente del Gobierno, Pedro Sanchez, ha anunciado este miercoles que el 'Plan de Recuperacion, Transformacion y Resiliencia de la Economia Española' movilizara 72.000 millones de euros de los fondos europeos en los proximos tres años, periodo en el que aportara un crecimiento de 2,5 puntos porcentuales de PIB al año y creara en conjunto mas de 800.000 puestos de trabajo.                                 Asi lo ha anunciado Sanchez durante la videoconferencia para presentar el plan, a la que se han conectado todos los miembros del Ejecutivo, la patronal y los sindicatos, asi como los embajadores de los 27 paises miembros de la UE y numerosos representantes de la sociedad civil.                                 Sanchez ha destacado que el plan busca la "modernizacion" de España y un crecimiento "inclusivo", para lo que ha detallado que de los 140.000 millones de euros, el 11% del PIB, que recibira España entre 2021 y 2026, con el Plan de Recuperacion se movilizaran 72.000 millones los tres primeros años, procedentes del Mecanismo de Recuperacion y Resiliencia (59.000 millones) y del fondo 'React-Eu' (12.400 millones).                                 A ello se suman los mas de 79.000 millones previstos de los fondos estructurales y de la Politica Agraria Comun (PAC) para 2021-2027.                                 En concreto, la inversion verde vinculada a la transicion ecologica representara mas del 37% del total del plan y la digital cerca del 33%, ha precisado Sanchez, quien ha indicado que el objetivo es crear miles de puestos de trabajos, miles de empresas y aumentar el tamaño de pymes.                                 De esta forma, ha apuntado que el efecto multiplicador de la "modernizacion" del plan generara mas de 2,5 puntos porcentuales adicionales de crecimiento del PIB en los proximos tres años y creara mas de 800.000 empleos en el periodo.                                                                          _Con informaci on de dpa_

The festival was originally planned as a week-long event at venues across Manchester in May, but had to be postponed as a result of the pandemic and national lockdown.

The money raised will go to Help Musicians and Manchester Mind, to support young people and musicians struggling with mental health issues and financial hardship inflicted by the pandemic.           __________           United We Stream executive producer and Warehouse Project boss Sacha Lord said he had seen in role as Greater Manchester's night time economy advisor how prevalent mental health issues are in his sector - particularly now.                      "With new measures in place, many venues still closed, there is an underlying amount of fear and anxiety for the future, not just amongst operators, but amongst employees too," he said.

I'd like to begin by giving kudos to David Chye, Deb Del Zoppo, Brenda Reeber, Barry Mathews and so many other contributors to this forum for the eloquent, truthful and heartfelt letters. As common sense prevails, I can only hope they will continue to contribute.          That being said there are a few other contributers who continue to pound away at one issue. They begin by defending Trump, who is the most incomepetent, immoral unqualified person to ever hold the office of president. That issue is Roe v. Wade. Trump panders to the evangelicals on this issue, yet, truth be told, he couldn't care less. If you Right-to-Lifers pick up your Bible and turn to Genisis 2:7, you'll find life begins at birth. No one has ever murdered a baby. A woman's right to reproductive health has been the law of the land for 47 years. The irony is, most Right-to-Lifers are really only pro-birth as many don't care about the child once it's born. An ill-fed, ill-clad, ill-cared for, unloved child suffers the worst form of child abuse. Trump is a horrible racist, and he's playing that race card because it's all he has left. His favorite playbook is to create fear and bloviating. He's trying to recapture an eroding base as his numbers slide. He's speaking to a much narrower group of Americans at a time when he's desperate for a turnaround.          During the COVID crisis, he has lost ground and his overall approval ratings have plummeted. He's ceded a large portion of his non-college educatedwhite voters who form the heart of his base and fallen further behind Joe Biden.          He currently has plans in the works to do away with Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid. This will cause 180 million working Americans and seniors to lose their health insurance and a large part of their incomes.

Firstly, this deal on a 2019 Dell XPS 13 for just $783.99 (was $857.98) is closing in on the cheapest price we've ever seen on a baseline Dell XPS 13 model. We've seen a couple of $699 price tags before, but those tend to be the reserve of the budget Dell XPS 13 Touch models, which, while having a touch-screen, only have a measly 4GB of RAM and a 128GB SSD. Not this machine, however - it's rocking a full 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, plus a rather speedy 10th gen Intel Core i3.          If you need something with a little more grunt, there's also a fantastic $125.99 off right now on an upgraded 2019 Dell XPS 13 Touch model - going for $881.99 (was  $1,008) currently. With a 10th gen Intel Core i5-10210U, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, you're getting a really flexible machine here, equally at home with spreadsheets, editing tasks, or simply sitting back and casually streaming.          Of course, both these Dell XPS 13 deals come with that gorgeous InfinityEdge display and premium, super-thin chassis, so you simply can't go wrong if you're on the hunt for a cheap ultrabook. Also recommended is checking out the upcoming Amazon Prime Day sales. Due to go live next Tuesday, these are a fantastic way to pick up some accessories for your new Dell laptop.

On the Rocks review: "Bill Murray essays pure, distilled Murray-ness"


--DocBreak--
Joe Agolino is being remembered as a believer in West Pittston who set an example after the devastating 2011 flood by rebuilding his landmark restaurant so quickly.          Agolino’s Restaurant announced Agolino’s death on its Facebook page Monday, saying the Luzerne Avenue restaurant would close the rest of the week as they mourn his death.          “The biggest thing I could say about Joe himself was the flood. He immediately started rebuilding the restaurant,” said former West Pittston Mayor Bill Goldsworthy. “It gave the community a lot of hope. If Agolino can do it and do it quickly and have faith in the community, you could, too.”          Agolino’s, started by Agolino’s father in the 1960s, reopened in early December 2011, about 2½ months after being devastated by flood waters. The business was rebuilt once before after the 1972 flood.          “He was a great guy from a great family,” Goldsworthy said. “He supported the community immensely. Whenever we had something going on in the community he was there to support it.”          The restaurant “meant the world to him,” family members wrote on the business’ Facebook page.          “... He lived and breathed it. He truly loved all his customers. He loved the business. He loved the hustle, the rush. He loved it all,” they wrote. “He loved West Pittston, the community and everything it represented. Dad, we love you and will continue the legacy in your honor.”          Hundreds of people shared the Facebook post and left comments.          Agolino was proud to host the Wyoming Area Warriors for a celebratory dinner after the team won a state championship in high school football last year.          Cassandra Coleman, a past Exeter mayor and a former top aide to Gov. Tom Wolf, called Agolino “a staple in our community.”          “Over the years, Agolino’s became the ‘go-to’ place — so much so as folks from all across the Commonwealth came to visit Northeast Pennsylvania, they knew a visit to Agolino’s at lunchtime would be a worthwhile hour spent,” Coleman said. “That is a testament to the hard work of and the smart businessman that Joe Agolino was. But most importantly, he was a true gentleman who loved his community, his customers and so much so, his wonderful family.”

MARSHFIELD - The 2019 Marshfield High girls soccer team made a decent run to get into the postseason, only to be ousted after a tight competitive, game, 2-0 by Bishop Feehan. The Rams' disappointment at that loss was assuaged a bit when the Shamrocks (23-0-1) went on to win the Division 1 state championship.          But there won't be much chance of building off the pride of a close battle with the state champs, because the bulk of that 2019 team's core graduated. How much soccer talent that 2019 class contained might be seen by noting that players from that group now play for the University of Rhode Island, University of Massachusetts, Bryant University, and Salve Regina.          It's not like the cupboard is bare but the 2020 Rams will have a few veterans, and many more players either joining varsity for the first time, or seeing their first substantial minutes at the top level. Coach Dominic Centorino welcomed a stunning 71 candidates to the opening of practice this fall, so the varsity, JVs and freshman teams will all be fully stocked. And the Patriot League 'bubble' schedule is a bit unusual, in a good way for a young team, as five of the Rams' first six games are at home. They started the season Friday with a 6-0 loss to Hingham.          "We lost a really strong senior core to graduation," said Centorino. "I would say at least three of them were just stellar athletes, the kind that are very hard to replace. This year's team is going to have to have a whole new identity of its own. We have some carryover, in returning players, but the new rules and everything make it all initially a bit overwhelming. I think our starting later this year has all the girls itching to get out there and play soccer, but it also leaves us a little behind on team bonding. Ultimately this season will be about the girls having fun, and bonding with their teammates, and we're just hoping to emphasize that, while playing good, competitive soccer."          Marshfield has a couple of veteran captains in seniors Sam McGregor and Julie Alcaro, and the latter has a real desire to get back into action. Alcaro tore up her knee and missed all of her junior season.          "They are a good pair of players to build around, and they are helping the other girls learn what it takes," said Centorino. "We kept as many players as we could this fall, so we have 29 players on our varsity team, and it is very senior-heavy, with 15 seniors. So I think that class will play a big role here, and Sam and Julie are excellent leaders."          A couple of other veterans will play major roles for the new-look Rams, in juniors Riley Drosopoulos, a defender, and Bridgette Barrowman, an offensive-minded midfielder.          "Riley is an outstanding back and we're lucky to have her," said Centorino, "while Bridgette is a junior who's basically been a starter since her freshman year. Those are two really important cogs for us."          Marshfield High's reboot had to begin in net, where the 2019 team had standout netminder Kate McNeill.          "We'll have senior Stella Scholfield and sophomore Sydney Sheehan playing goalkeeper for us," said Centorino. "They have both looked good so far. We also have a freshman goalie playing on the JVs - it's always good to have a couple goalies in the system, and after graduating Kate we had to replenish that position."          Some other key performers come from all the classes.          "We're looking for a big season from senior Laney Zaslaw, who scored a hat trick against Cohasset last year," noted Centorino. "And Laney has her kid sister, sophomore Sammy Zaslaw, a midfielder also on the team. We have two sets of sisters, with Sam McGregor's sophomore sister Maddie, a defender and midfielder, joining us, so that's always a good thing."          "Mya D'Antonio is another young player with lots of potential, a sophomore forward who came up as a freshman last year," said Centorino. "And then we have junior Nadia Kiziuk, a very skilled midfielder. Sydney McCabe is another fine midfielder player, a junior, as is forward Sara Weijkus, and they've done well."          "A couple of seniors we're looking to are forward Celine LeDoux and midfielder Gwyn O'Sullivan, and they are certainly in the mix too," said Centorino.          When you get to the more specific roles, it isn't quite as clear who might emerge as the Rams scoring threats.          "Last year we shared the wealth, and no one person scored a lot of goals," said Centorino. "I suspect it may be that way again. We have a lot of forwards this year, and we'll try and rotate them all in. One thing that helps there is the quarters format, instead of just playing halves like we did before. Four periods will help break it up and help us manage everyone's minutes better."          The new pandemic MIAA rules changes are also likely to boost offense. There are no throw-ins but rather kick-ins, no heading the ball, no slide tackles, and minimal shoulder to shoulder contact allowed. Most observers would suggest it will make playing defense even more difficult.          "We are expecting there will be penalties and a lot of indirect kicks for contact fouls," said Centorino. "And with teams unable to form defensive walls, those set plays become even more important. I think we are expecting a big season from Julie Alcaro, who has been itching to play for over a year, and did a lot of work to recover from her knee injury. We also expect to get some scoring from Bridgette Barrowman out of the midfield, as well as Laney Zaslaw, and Syndey McCabe."          The Rams have studied the new rules and played two pre-season scrimmages, with referees to help them adjust.          "Initially we all had some officials do a Zoom meeting to explain the new rules, and how they would be interpreted," Centorino explained. "My first impression was that this could be a high-scoring season for everyone, and from what we've seen it will be, but not absurdly so. I also believe the boys game is much more physical and faster than our game, so it may not be as big an adjustment for us. The silver lining, for us coaches, is that the key to playing with this new rulebook is stressing possession. We have to be more deliberate and patient with how we progress the ball down the field. And those direct free kicks with no wall will be big plays."          "Our defenders have had two scrimmages with game officials to help us adjust," Centorino added. "The officials we had took the time to explain the calls they made, and those scrimmages - against Pembroke and Silver Lake - really helped us. If you kick the ball in the air, for example, it's a re-start. We have to play within the confines of the new rules, and find a way to be successful. But none of us wants a whistle every two minutes, or to ruin the flow of the game. We are hoping for consistency in enforcing the rules, and we know the officials' job is hard. But the main goal, is for everyone involved to have some fun playing soccer, and hopefully developing their skills, while enjoying all the social and emotional benefits of being part of a team"          After the Rams' opening game, the state lifted restrictions on crowd sizes, so they anticipate being able to have up to 250 fans for each remaining home game. All the players and coaches were anxious to get going, and they have had to basically shrug off any misgivings about getting a late start and a compressed season. But once again, Marshfield becoming a full-fledged member of the Patriot League this fall has eased the way, and provided a competitive 11-game season.          "There was a time we didn't know if this season would happen," Centorino admitted. "Finally they gave us a date and a structure, and we got to work. We do miss having more pre-season time, but we have 11 girls who play year-round, which helps. Every other team is in the same boat as far as limited practice, and I think we miss the opportunity for team bonding most of all. I have to give Bill Battis, our athletic director, a lot of thanks for all he's done, because he's been awesome, and brings so much credibility to our program. Our tryouts went well, the team looks good so far, and everyone is in agreement - it's great to be back."

Suzuki Motorcycle India on Wednesday said it currently has no plans to enter two-wheeler commuter segment in the country. The company, which on Wednesday introduced its Access 125 and Burgman Street scooters with bluetooth-enabled digital console priced at Rs 78,600 and Rs 84,600, respectively (ex-showroom Delhi), would continue to focus on 125 cc scooter and above 150 cc bike segments in the country.          "As a policy, we are concentrating on 125 cc scooter market and in motorcycle segment over 150 cc segment only, so we don't have any plan to bring a commuter scooter or 100 cc motorcycle. We don't have any plan right now," Suzuki Motorcycle India Pvt Ltd (SMIPL) Managing Director Koichiro Hirao told reporters. Commuter segment bikes and scooters usually come with smaller capacity engines with focus on fuel efficiency rather than out-and-out performance.          Suzuki Motorcycle currently sells bikes in above 150 cc category and two 125 cc scooter models in the country. SMIPL Vice-President (sales, marketing and aftersales) Devashish Handa said the company is looking to expand its sales network by just around 1 per cent this fiscal.          "It is very much by choice. After having improved our pecking order in the domestic two-wheeler industry from number seven in 2018-19 to number five now, we have realised that in order to secure our aspirations we need to start focusing on quality as much as we have focused on quantity," Handa noted. The company expanded its sales network by 8 per cent in 2018-19, which was reduced to just 2 per cent in 2019-20.          The company's entire network initiative this year would be on ensuring that its secondary network policy, which was initiated last year, gets completed on ground, he added. The company currently has over 530 dealerships across the country.          SMIPL, however, aims to expand its pre-owned business vertical across the country, Handa said. "In phase one we were present in one location, in second phase we added five more locations and now in third phase we plan to further scale it up and consolidate this initiative. We have now understood nuts and bolts of pre-owned vehicle business," he added.          Commenting on the upcoming festive season, Handa said the company remains optimistic about sales performance during the period stretching from middle of this month to November-end. "We have witnessed improvement in sales over the last few months. In September, we even performed better than same month last year. In line with this, we are optimistic about festive season as well," Handa said.          Commenting on the new launches, Hirao said bluetooth console on both the models can be paired with smartphone thus, enabling turn by turn navigation and other features like call and SMS alert display, WhatsApp alert, estimated time of arrival alerts, missed call alert and caller id, over-speed warning and phone battery level display. "The technology has been developed keeping the requirements of today's young customer in mind who always wants to stay connected, but doesn't want to compromise on his/her safety by using a phone while riding a two-wheeler," he added.
