He is survived by his mother, Minta Stovall, his sister, Susanna Pettis and her two children, Jaden and Amelia Janah, his aunt, Ginny Pettis Noyes and his aunt and uncle Barbara and James Stovall. David was the Grandson of Al and Irene Stovall who developed several hotel/motel properties at Disneyland in Anaheim. Born in Newport Beach, David grew up in Grass Valley where he attended Mt. St. Mary's elementary and Nevada Union high school, following which he went to the University of Nevada in Reno. He had a heart of gold and a great sense of humor. He spent his life pursuing his interests in farming, solar energy, and real estate development.

 Abramovich also seems happy to delegate authority at Stamford Bridge, particularly to chairman Bruce Buck and transfer guru Marina Granovskaia. While not through choice, UK visa woes have also made the 54-year-old an absent owner in recent years, at least in the physical sense.  
 In contrast, even though Galitsky has trusted lieutenants such as general director Vladimir Khashig and Serbian academy adviser Aleksandar Marjanovich, he appears to be as hands-on as owners come and his influence is all- encompassing.
 He is also unabashed in his desire to turn Krasnodar into a club which will do the region - and Russia - proud, almost as if it's a patriotic duty.
  _" Galitsky has built everything completely from scratch, quite literally,"_ said local journalist Potapova when asked to compare the Krasnodar patron with Abramovich.

 But with an estimated wealth of $3.4 billion, Galitsky is a man who can afford it.
 Born as Sergey Arutyunyan in Lazarevskoye, just along the coast from Sochi, he would later change his name on marrying, swapping his own Armenian surname for his wife's more Russian-sounding one.
 After completing national service, Galitsky studied economics at Kuban State University in Krasnodar, later doing a stint in a bank.
 But it was when he opened his first shop in the city in 1998 that Galitsky's business rise would truly begin.
 From there, he went on to build a mammoth retail empire under his low-cost Magnit brand, which grew to become one of the largest private companies in Russia.

With restaurants around the country shuttering due to the drop in business from the coronavirus pandemic, the drop in temperatures approaching the winter season has posed a new challenge for businesses relying on outdoor dining.
 During the summer, with warmer temperatures and loosened restrictions on outdoor dining to help restaurants stay afloat, many Taunton-area restaurants noted that customers have preferred to dine outside versus indoors. In turn, those eateries have sought to continue outdoor dining as long as possible with the use of large tents, heaters and blankets.
 At Barrels and Boards in Raynham, owner David Laghetto said they had been utilizing tables on their patio for seating, but had expanded to tented seating in the parking lot. As temperatures have dropped, they've installed heaters that have warmed up the tent for diners, with Laghetto saying that tables have filled up both outdoors and inside the Route 138 restaurant.
 But with the tent not equipped to handle snow load, and with questions about whether the heaters will be sufficient when temperatures get brutally cold, there's the potential for them to lose over 20 tables as they can't be brought back inside due to distancing requirements, Laghetto said.
 "We don't know what the winter is going to bring and how long we can keep the tents up," he said. "We're hoping for Nov. 30, we don't know if it's going to be Nov. 30, but we're hoping for that long. We do know when snow season starts, which is considered Dec. 1, the tent will have to come down."
 At Emma's Pizza and Pub in Bridgewater, owner Ron Emma said they're also hoping to hang on to outdoor dining as long as possible, as he said he's looking to buy industrial heaters that blow heat into the tent instead of the outdoor patio heaters using propane that he's seen other businesses using.
 During the day when the weather is nice, more customers are choosing to sit outside, Emma said, but as it gets dark and temperatures decline, a greater number of customers choose to dine inside. But he expressed concern about the winter, more specifically when it starts to snow.
 "There are two things the tent can't withstand, and that's wind over 30 mph and then a heavy snow load," he said. "Between the wind and the snow load, we're going to go as far as we can until we can't."
 Along with extensive renovations inside to install plexiglass dividers and add filtration systems to filter out airborne pathogens, Maguire's Bar and Grill in Easton has also chosen to utilize outdoor tents with heaters that pump in fresh air from outside instead of recirculating the air inside.
 "We're pretty confident that we'll be able to handle the winter," owner Neil Levine said.
 Unlike other establishments that expressed concerns about snow load, Levine said he's confident in the heaters, noting that they're capable of increasing the temperature inside the tent 20 degrees -- though Levine said he had one night recently where it was 40 degrees and the heaters were able to raise the temperature inside the tent to 69 degrees.
 "With the heater on and the temperature at 70, we feel most of the snow will run off and melt upon contact," he said. "Anything that doesn't melt upon contact, we'll rake off. We constantly want to maintain our parking lots and roofs of our building, always raking snow off and keeping snow loads down so we'll be able to maintain a zero snow load on top of the tent. If it ever got ahead of us, we'd obviously not seat anyone inside the tent until we make sure it's safe."
 Over at another Easton establishment, The Farmer's Daughter, owner and executive chef Chandra Gouldrup said she's a bit more nervous with winter approaching. Unlike other restaurants that have the space to expand outdoor seating into parking lots and private spaces, Gouldrup said they had to receive special permission from town officials to expand outdoor dining to the sidewalk and several parking spots in front of the restaurant due to their lack of outdoor space, which has limited their setup.
 But Gouldrup said they've recently received verbal confirmation to look at tenting some of the outdoor space, which she hopes will help with the heating situation. While she's hoping to receive official confirmation to have it set up for this year, they've implemented some outdoor electric heating in the meantime.
 "I don't see us being able to bank on extending our outdoor dining just based off of heaters," she said. "I don't think it'll be enough, personally, but we're certainly going to try everything we can."
 And there's the concern about any possible tents being able to handle snow and also snow removal by the town, especially with them using parking spots for seating, she said.
 In the meantime, with chillier weather, Gouldrup said they've started selling fleece blankets with the restaurant's logo.
 "It was so well-received, people were buying them more as a keepsake than a warming item," she said.
 While previously the blankets were sold for $5, for which the restaurant ate half the cost, the popularity of the item has led them to recently increase the price to $10 to cover the cost of it without any profit for the restaurant, Gouldrup said -- and they're encouraging customers to bring them back to reuse while dining.
 "Just because everything has to be single-use right now, there's no way to launder them," she said. "A lot of the regulars have come in with them already. A new BYOB -- bring your own blanket."
 And while she said she's nervous as a business owner about the wintertime, she's hopeful customers will continue to come out to support the business.
 "I have been pleasantly surprised since we've opened that we've been able to persevere throughout all these COVID challenges and we're doing numbers I wouldn't even be dreaming to see at this time, considering our guests have really rallied and not let the weather impact things," she said. "We're hopeful the weather is going to continue to stay and guests will continue to support us as they have."

One of Lake Havasu City’s schools was paid a special virtual visit from federal officials on Monday morning to highlight their students’ success and how they’ve wrestled with the pandemic.
 Frank Brogan, assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education for the U.S. Department of Education, held a Skype call Monday morning with Havasu Preparatory Academy leader Dana Mills, as well as multiple parents, students and teachers. The call was also attended by representatives of Sen. Martha McSally and Rep. Paul Gosar.
 Brogan’s goal for the virtual “showcase” was to learn more about how the school has helped students succeed and to better understand how they’ve managed the year’s biggest hurdle — the covid-19 pandemic.
 Before the virus, Brogan traveled across the country visiting schools in each state that were “making a change and doing things differently” and seeing “rising student achievement levels” as a result of those changes. But in a time where travel became restricted, they decided to take some visits virtual and focus on a new facet of education — how to safely reopen classrooms.
 “It has been an extraordinary awakening,” Brogan said, adding that it’s allowed them to visit many more schools on top of learning more about how education has changed in the face of a pandemic.
 “After the changes [in schools] began to be made, it didn’t take very long for both adults and students to come to terms with the fact that some of the changes were pretty good and maybe should hang around after the coronavirus passes us by,” Brogan said.
 The “showcase” visits also provide working examples to schools and districts that are trying to navigate and plan their own reopenings. Havasu Preparatory Academy was chosen to fill that role.
 Mills outlined how her school is currently operating and what precautions are in place, such as face mask requirements, desks placed six feet apart, and water bottle stations that have replaced drinking fountains. She also emphasized the continued use of online learning in tandem with in-person instruction, allowing for seamless transition both into and out of the classroom, should schools need to be closed again or students decide to return to campus.
 Brogan was also introduced to some teachers and parents, who expressed their confidence in HPA’s return to campus and the safety measures implemented. Students told him that their teachers are “nice,” and they’re glad to be back in classrooms.
 With years of experience in education roles and on school campuses, Brogan said, “I know, not only what a busy time of year it is, but I also know these could not be more interesting times if you tried to make it up on a good day… I know what an invasion like this can do by way of disruption.”
 But there’s “a reawakening” taking place in America as to the importance of schools, Brogan said, adding that “sometimes, you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone.”

The traditional ringing of the bells in front of red kettles will be a little quieter around the region this year, as the Salvation Army prepares for a holiday season with high demand.
 The Framingham Salvation Army has been busy, working with other agencies to deliver food to those in need, said Major Wendy Kountz, commanding officer at the Framingham Salvation Army. But despite that need, she says the Framingham chapter is skipping a long tradition.
 Kountz said she has made the decision not to put out any red kettles this Christmas and is requesting mail donations and online donations.
 "Safety is the most important thing," she said. "We also want to make sure families aren't going without, so we just put the necessary precautions in place."
    Framingham's emergency food hotline fills key gap in COVID-19 assistance: delivery  
 With some chapters making decisions like Kountz, and other factors, the Salvation Army will have fewer red kettles and that will directly impact the number of donations it receives.
 "We're anticipating the red kettle donations to go down by about 50%," she said. "Last year in Massachusetts, we raised about $2.5 million," said Heather MacFarlane, Salvation Army Massachusetts Communications Director.
 If a chapter does decide to have bell ringers, the Salvation Army has to negotiate with the individual landlords and stores to determine if it is safe to do so.
 Patricia James, public relations manager for the Salvation Army of Northern New England, an umbrella organization for the state chapters, said the kettles will be out this year across the country, with new rules in place.
 Bell ringers will wear masks; will stand 6 feet away from the kettle and will move even farther back when someone approaches to donate. The kettles will be sanitized in between shifts.
 Even without the threat of COVID-19, she worries about the future of the kettles as a fundraising tool because of the increasingly cashless society.
 "I can't say I blame them," James said of people who don't carry cash. "I do the same thing."

 The kettles have been around for 130 years, according to James, starting in San Francisco in 1890. Every year prior to COVID-19, the Salvation Army raised about $126 million nationwide through the kettles, with 82 cents of every dollar going to local needs, James said.
 To make up the loss, the Salvation Army has requested that people donate on a monthly recurring basis at salvationarmyma.org/rescuechristmas.
 "Our ability to raise vital funds to serve those in need this Christmas and beyond is at risk," Commissioner Kenneth G. Hodder, national commander of The Salvation Army said, as reported by the Providence Journal. "We need everyone who has the capacity to come alongside us and ensure that the holiday season is bright for millions. We're asking you to help rescue Christmas with us by providing support in any way you can."
 An increasing need
 The Salvation Army is expecting to see a 156% increase in the amount of Massachusetts residents requesting assistance this holiday season, according to MacFarlane.
 As the pandemic continues, Kountz said she anticipates drive-in distributions to continue for the foreseeable future.
 The Framingham chapter has also had to adjust their operations and the number of volunteers they bring in.
 "It's going to be quieter this year because we aren't going to have all our locations that we have before," she said. "So for instance, for our Thanksgiving distribution, normally we have families come into the building, pick up their turkeys, pick up their foodbox and leave, but this year we are doing a drive-in distribution where it will be outside under the tent. It will be the same thing when we are giving toys to keep everybody safe. Safety is the number one thing."

 The visit of Chelsea this week will invite inevitable comparisons between Galitsky and Abramovich, that most famous of Russian oligarchs.
 Galitsky has previously said that the pair are not acquainted, and while it would be _"interesting"_ to discuss football with his fellow billionaire, _"it's not one of his aims in life."_
 Whether Galitsky likes it or not, there are evident similarities between the pair: both are football obsessives who have ploughed vast sums into making their dreams become reality; both, by and large, are publicity-shy; and both have a penchant for superyachts (in Galisky's case the $225 million, 104-meter 'Quantum Blue', built in 2014).  
 Yet the contrasts are also stark. Abramovich's conspicuous consumption has come in a foreign field, causing a lingering resentment among some in his homeland that his London spending spree is unpatriotic, siphoning money away from the energy-rich country which has furnished him with his vast wealth.

Another beautiful day in Havasu...
 Orchids to Dr. Prater and staff for providing great healthcare. When performing an ear exam, think of how many times the doctor has heard “can you see through to the other side?” and still chuckled. Special effort from Sierra. Guinea Pig.
 Orchids to Air Control for their great service with our HVAC and plumbing. We appreciate the timely help with our leak.
 Onions to the guy who called my $24,000 custom car a jalopy just because he didn’t want his wife to buy it. The Curmudgeon.
 Orchids to George at Walgreens. His smile is only a part of his personality. He greets everyone as if they were family. I’m proud to call him my friend. “Ranger Terry”.
 Orchids to Cody at Shoreline who made an emergency trip Friday night to unblock our sewer line! He was friendly, knowledgeable and efficient! He is an asset to Shoreline Plumbing! Thanks, Cody from Apache Drive.
 Onions to the doctor’s office demanding an office visit before refilling diabetic prescriptions. No wonder we can’t get a handle on this nightmare.
 Orchids to the person who gave a great big onion to the huge eyesore, the blue sign, visible from State Route 95. And the stadium lighting on it too! And the business owner who allowed it! Really? A lot of money that could have gone to a better cause here in town!
 Onions to the theater whose popcorn is not buttered, but garnished with a rude oily substance instead. Very disappointing to purchase a popcorn card for a poor product.
 Onions to the busy body complaining about seeing a parent spank their child. Mind your own business. Maybe the parent doesn’t want their child to grow up to be a snowflake like you!
 Orchids to stop signs. They work great when you know how to use one, not so much when you don’t. Pay attention people.
 Orchids to both Bill Thompson and Terry Lahey, for your input. I agree with you entirely.
 Onions to the gigantic blue sign facing State Route 95. It is over the size limit and represents a dangerous distraction to drivers. It does not meet the rules governing such signs.

On October 30th, 2020 at 230 PM IST, the publication will speak to the Honourable Roosevelt Skerrit, the Prime Minister of Dominica, about why the island remains a top destination for many investors. His Excellency Emmanuel Nanthan, the Head of the CBI Unit will also present a step-by-step guide into the application process.

 Bucking the trend of Russia's billionaires making their fortunes from the country's energy resources, Galitsky's was a concern which grew from the provinces, rather than the traditional power centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg. From the outset, he was an oligarch with a difference.  
 He was also a man with a passion for football stemming from his youth - an interest he shared with an obsession for chess. Just as Galitsky's business interests grew, so did his ambitions to lay the foundations for something which would drag Russian football kicking and screaming into a new era.
 His vision was so all-consuming that it is rumored to have been a crucial factor in his decision to sell the majority of his stake in Magnit in 2018, for which he netted $2.45 billion.  
 By that stage, Krasnodar were already a fully-fledged force in the Russian top tier. After their foundation in 2008, they had ascended to the Russian Premier League by the 2011-12 season, finishing ninth. They have mounted title challenges in recent years, although their highest finish remains third.
 While this season is their first in the giddy heights of the Champions League - a right they earned by beating Greeks PAOK in a two-legged playoff in September - their continental bow came in the Europa League in the 2014-15 season, and they have twice reached the last 16 in the competition.

 “But it’s almost as if he’s been expected to have this leadership role right from the minute he came in the door.
 “It’s probably his own choice as he’s that kind of player.
 “It is a lot to take on your shoulders though when you are trying to adapt to playing for a new team.
 “There’s no doubt he’s made some mistakes and he’ll be the first to admit it. It could be that he’s trying too hard to impress.
 “There is always immense pressure when you play with a club like Celtic.
 “That’s another reason he should simplify his game and stick to doing what he does best. He’s going through a difficult spell right now but, the type of character he is, I’m sure he’ll come through it and Celtic supporters will see the best of him.”
 Bonner felt Celts had enough attacking intent on Sunday to be positive going to Lille in the Europa League on Thursday.

PLYMOUTH -- Four centuries after white Europeans stepped off the Mayflower and onto America's shores, some descendants of the colonists are wrestling with the complicated legacy of their ancestors amid a global racial reckoning.
 There is immense pride among those who can trace their families back to the passengers who boarded the ship in Plymouth, England, in 1620 to flee religious persecution and realize a better life. Yet for some, the devastating impact that the Pilgrims' landing in New England had on Native Americans weighs heavily in this moment of unrest over systemic racism.
 In interviews with The Associated Press, Americans and Britons who can trace their ancestry either to the Pilgrims or the Indigenous people who helped them survive talked openly about the need in 2020 to fairly tell the history.
 "Considering my ancestors helped incite the racial hierarchies that caused the need for these movements now, I do feel ashamed that that had to be part of history," said Olivia Musoke, 19, whose ancestor on her mother's side arrived in America on the Mayflower.
 Musoke, whose father is Black, said the pride she feels in coming from people who helped settle this country "gets diminished by the role they played in kind of manipulating and terrorizing people of color, which trickled down to the structures we have today."
 For some, it's a difficult issue to reconcile.
 "The pilgrims came out of religious persecution in England. And I'm very proud of the fact that they set off to create their own independent culture," said Seth Howland Handy, 53, another descendant of a Mayflower passenger. "But they came to a place where there was existing culture. And, you know, the history is not friendly and that is troublesome," he said.
 Handy said it's more important now than ever now to "recognize everyone's role in our history and the great diversity of this country." The U.S. was embroiled in civil unrest this summer, with protesters demanding justice for George Floyd and other Black Americans killed or injured by police.
 Ginny Mucciacco, a descendant of Mayflower passenger Degory Priest, said the Pilgrims' work ethic was admirable.
 "To have this tie to our early history is really, I won't say it's a privilege, an honor. But it's just something to be proud of because so many of them worked so hard, for so many years to help establish this country. And it's just very important to me," said Mucciacco, 90, of Dedham, Massachusetts.
 The soul-searching extends across the Atlantic to England, where Mayflower descendants say they, too, are trying to reconcile pride and prejudice.
 Vicky Cosstick, a Briton whose ancestors John Alden and Priscilla Mullins were passengers, said she's troubled by the suffering the Indigenous people endured -- but she doesn't feel guilt.
 "I'm of course horrified and appalled to know what happened as a result of British colonialism in America and what happened to their Native American tribes and the Wampanoags," Cosstick said.
 "It's not as if they went to America in order to steal land from an Indigenous population," she said. "Much of it was clearly wrong, but there are many stories that need to be told. And I think the anniversary gives a chance for all of those stories to be told."
 As the racial reckoning has brought new scrutiny to how African American history is taught in American schools, Native Americans have long pushed for the unvarnished stories of their ancestors to be heard.
 When the Pilgrims arrived at what we now know as Plymouth, Massachusetts, the Wampanoag tribe helped the exhausted settlers survive their first winter. But Native Americans also endured racism, oppression and new diseases brought by the European settlers.
 "We were exposed to disease. We were exposed to slavery. I mean, what happened here was people who came not just for religion -- that might have been their purpose of leaving their homeland -- but they came here and wanted to wipe out the existence of a whole culture," said Hazel Harding Currence, 78, of the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe of Cape Cod.
 Organizers of the events planned for this year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Mayflower's arrival pledged to amplify the voices of the Wampanoag, which have been marginalized in past years. Fifty years ago, state officials disinvited a leader of the Wampanoag Nation to the commemoration after learning his speech would bemoan the tribe's suffering.
 This year, many anniversary events were canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 "We should have never been treated the way that we were, our ancestors," Currence said. "I think that if they were here now, if they were looking down on us, I think they'd be very proud at the movement that's going forward now."
 Even though the virus has put a damper on the commemoration, some members of the Wampanoag tribe say they're hopeful that the attention on the problem of systemic racism this year will help their voices and stories be heard in a way they haven't been before.
 "It's opening up everyone else's eyes to how unbalanced the world is and unequal," said Troy Currence, Hazel Harding Currence's son and a medicine man from the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe.
 "The world is spinning out of control. So I think more people are going to be aware and more sensitive and open to receiving a message like that," he said.

It’s hard to believe, but the wave of covid cancellations has already stretched into next year’s events. Colleges and universities across the nation have begun cancelling their plans for spring break 2021. On one hand, March and April are still half a year away and nobody has a crystal ball to know if life as we know it will still center around facemasks and social distancing, or if crowds be able to gather in large groups again without second-guessing themselves about safety concerns. On the other hand, universities have to be able to plan their calendars months and years in advance, so the cancellations are understandable considering all of the current uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus.
 In the grand scheme of things, college students will be OK without a spring break. It’s hardly a crisis. However, that might not be true for resort communities like Lake Havasu City, where the local economy partially depends on spring breakers returning year after year.
 Each March, thousands of students from more than 40 schools head to Havasu for the annual celebration of spring, and their arrival is a welcomed occurence after the slower winter months.
 Fewer students heading to Havasu in 2021 could be a big problem for the local businesses that depend on them.
 Luckily, Havasu has broadened its economic base over the years with a larger marketing emphasis on regional and family-based tourism, but that doesn’t mean we should let spring break wither on the vine.
 Havasu needs a fresh approach to spring break, and that’s been clear for a while. Certainly long before coronavirus crept into the conversation.
 It has been decades since our MTV heyday, and the organizers of spring break vacations left town a few years ago.
 It’s time for a real community conversation about the future of spring break in Lake Havasu City. It’s always been an important piece of our tourism mix, so simply letting it die shouldn’t be an option.
