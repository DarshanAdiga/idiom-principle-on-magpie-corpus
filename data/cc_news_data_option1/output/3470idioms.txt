When a guilty verdict was finally delivered against him in July 2010, he was sentenced to 35 years, shortened to just 19 due to time served. The judges said they considered the Cold War context of the atrocities and Duch’s cooperation and expressions of remorse, however limited. But outraged survivors feared he could one day walk free. On appeal, the sentence was lengthened in 2012 to life in prison for his “shocking and heinous” crimes against the Cambodian people.

All in all, Scriptures is an album from scratch, where everything is just as it should be. A jewel in the catalogue of a band that has been present from the very beginning and - freely based on one of their most popular songs "We Bow To None" - has always remained true to themselves and their fans.

Aberdeen Central had to make some adjustments at the start of the match, but still came away with a 7-2 win over Milbank Tuesday afternoon at the Holgate Courts.
 "Right when we got done with warmups, the wind came up, so all the girls had to adjust on the fly," said Central coach John Vogel.
 But adjust they did, and the Golden Eagles nearly swept through singles play and took two out of three in doubles for the 7-2 final.

Sam Ehliger gets his last chance to win a Big 12 title for 14th-ranked Texas, which lost the league championship game two years ago after beating Oklahoma earlier that season. Charlie Brewer and Baylor took the Sooners to overtime in last year's title game, though the tough-minded quarterback didn't play after halftime following a hard hit he delivered on a defender on a running play before taking a hard sack.

GamesRadar+ recently spoke with Laura Bailey, who voiced Abby from The Last of Us 2 and Black Widow from Marvel's Avengers, so naturally we asked the actor what would happen if the two characters got in a fist fight.
 It's a testament to Abby that Bailey's first reaction was to ask whether Black Widow gets to use "all [her] toys." And considering Black Widow's - you know - a superhero, we figured it's only fair that both she and Abby go in with only their fists and all-natural talents for violence.
 "I would probably say Widow. You know, I think that Abby could definitely do some damage, but the training - the years and years and years of training in a different environment… Yeah," Bailey said.
 As much as we stan Abby all day long, we're inclined to agree. Abby's faced some pretty scary enemies - clickers, the Rat King, and Ellie, to name a few - but never anything quite as dangerous as a former SHIELD spy and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Let us not forget the fight from Iron Man 2 where she dispatched about a dozen thugs working for Hammer Industries without breaking a sweat.
 When Marvel's Avengers releases on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Stadia September 4, you'll be able to harness Black Widow's acrobatic, trick-shooting power as well as every other Avenger's unique strengths.

Scriptures (produced by Scott Atkins at Grindstone Studio in England), sounds 100% like Benediction: they blend death metal with a "fuck-off punk rock attitude", heavy metal riffing and a groove that hardly any other band can perform like this. Dave Ingram's "signature-growls" and powerful lyrics enhance the tonal framework so that you can hear after a few notes that you are listening to Benediction. As usual the tracks vary from slow and heavy to fast and intense, from shorter "in your face" numbers to epic masterpieces.
