How, when or where are impossible to predict, but Soleimani's influence was such that Iran's Shia proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria will do whatever the mad mullahs of Tehran order them to do.
 This can be taken as a given.
 In June of last year, Iran responded to Trump's attempt to curb its nuclear program by attacking oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz and shooting down a U.S. surveillance drone that entered its air space.
 Soon after, Trump ordered a retaliatory air strike, but pulled the pin on it 10 minutes before launch, claiming at the time that 150 innocent people would have been unnecessarily killed, which would have been a disproportionate response to the offence committed.
 But that was then.
 Fear of Iran has been a 40-year obsession for American presidents, going back to the April night in 1979 when Shia zealots took control of the American embassy in Tehran and held 55 hostages for 444 days until the very end of Jimmy Carter's presidency.
 By noon Monday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan's office said developments in Iraq's parliament are being closely monitored after it expelled all foreign troops from its country.
 Sajjan's press secretary, Todd Lane, refused, however, to say if there was a Plan B, but the Canadian-led NATO mission in Iraq aimed at ISIS militants was temporarily suspended once Soleimani was extinguished.
 Trudeau, though, has yet to personally comment on the terrorist commander's death by a Hellfire R9X Ninja missile launched from a Reaper drone taking its cues from almost 12,000 km away.
 But Croatia, rest assured, does have a new president.

A serial offender who murdered a woman on board a mail express train between Borivali and Dadar in December 2018 was arrested by the Government Railway Police (GRP). The accused, identified as Mohammad Aslam Shaikh (47), has also been charged with robbing two women in November and December 2019.
 Ravindra Sengavkar, Commissioner, Mumbai GRP, said the accused had set a pattern where he would target women’s compartments of long-distance passenger trains where there was only one passenger. “He would climb onto the train just as it was leaving the platform and then rob the woman. He would alight as the train was approaching a platform or if the train slowed down in the middle,” he said.
 GRP officials said using the description given by the two victims of the robberies in 2019, they laid a trap near Dadar station. “The accused used to board the train in Borivali, where trains would usually empty out. Since they were mail express trains, the next stop would either be Dadar or Mumbai Central,” a GRP official said.
 The accused was taken into custody on January 1 and questioned. He confessed to the robberies in November and December 2019 and then on further questioning, he confessed to the murder of Deriya Devi Chowdhary (40) in December 2018. “According to his statement, the victim slapped him while resisting his attempt to rob her, after which he stabbed her with his knife,” a GRP official said.
 Mr. Sengavkar said since his arrest they have recovered nearly 95% of the goods he had stolen from victims, which include mobile phones and gold chains. He said they were planning to also arrest his friend Shakeel Khan and his mother Salma Shaikh in connection with the crimes.
 A resident of Kalwa, Mr. Shaikh used to live with his mother and had been sent to jail for targeting women in long-distance passenger trains. “He was charged with robbing women by the Dadar GRP and was sent to jail for nine years in 2010. The sentence was later commuted and he was released in August 2018 from Kolhapur jail,” a GRP official said.
 While there was CCTV footage of the accused, GRP officials said, in most of them he wore a cap making it difficult to recognise the person. “We found that he was also carrying a bag in a particular fashion. He used to portray himself as a ragpicker to evade suspicion,” a GRP official said.

Sam Wyche      Pickens - PICKENS, S.C.--Sam Wyche, who brought imagination to the sport of football, an AFC Championship to the Cincinnati Bengals, and a joy of life to the players, friends and family around him, died Thursday after a short battle with metastatic melanoma. He was 74.      Wyche, who lived in the country town of Pickens for his last 20 years, died at home, surrounded by his family: wife Jane, daughter Kerry and son Zak and their families. He had a Renaissance life as an NFL player, a college head coach, pro head coach, broadcaster, amateur magician, pilot, sporting-goods store owner and county councilmember in Pickens County, his adopted home. He was close to death with heart disease in September 2016, but got a last-minute heart transplant that gave him three more years of life.      "He was funny, brilliant at football, complicated, forward-thinking and a great human being," said Boomer Esiason, who had an NFL Most Valuable Player season under Wyche's tutelage in 1988. "This is such a sad day. He meant everything to me. He made me into the quarterback I became."      "It's so sad when bad things happen to good people," said Joe Montana, whose first position coach in the NFL with San Francisco was Wyche, in 1979. "Sam was the best. He's one of those people that it's so accurate to say, 'They don't make 'em like him anymore.' "      Wyche had a brief pro football career, starting nine games for the expansion Bengals in Cincinnati (1968-'70) under then-coach Paul Brown. He then played as a backup in Washington (1971-'73), Detroit (1974) and St. Louis (1976). Familiar with Bill Walsh from Walsh's days as an offensive assistant in Cincinnati, Wyche got hired on Walsh's first coaching staff in San Francisco as quarterbacks coach in 1979. His first NFL student was a rookie named Joe Montana.      "Sam was exactly what I needed early in my career," Montana said. "He was a great teacher. I was a practical joker, and Sam was great at that too. He had a way of making you feel so good when you were feeling your worst."      They stayed close for years after Wyche left the 49ers to be the head coach Indiana University in 1983. Despite a 3-8 season with the Hoosiers, Wyche was Brown's choice to coach the Bengals in 1984.      Immediately Wyche pressed the envelope in the NFL, giving quarterback Ken Anderson and Esiason independence to change plays and run a wide-open offense. It was Wyche who eventually instituted the no-huddle offense that frustrated defenses league-wide and led Esiason to be a dominant NFL quarterback. "He entrusted me with his brainchild, the no-huddle offense, and we were able to make it something great," Esiason recalled. "Sam was always trying to come up with something new and different, and it's amazing how often he was able to do that."      He often said football should be fun, and players play better when they enjoy what they're doing. Choreographed by Wyche, the Cincinnati offense exploded for a league-best 448 points in 1988. Cincinnati made the Super Bowl that season against Wyche's old mentor, Walsh, and former pupil, Montana. And it was Montana who led a late drive for the 49ers to beat Cincinnati 20-16.      That was only part of what made Wyche the person he was. Before his first game as an NFL head coach n 1984, he posed for the front page of the Cincinnati Enquirer in a tuxedo, pulling a rabbit out of a top hat. He loved magic, and performed it often--including at a Christmas show at a Cincinnati orphanage in December 1984, during the season. Most head coaches would do their charitable works in the off-season, but Wyche would do them anytime, anyplace. "I love magic," he once said. "I love seeing the kids' faces when I can make them marvel at something I was able to do."      "Of course Sam was brilliant at football," said Cris Collinsworth, a wide receiver for the Bengals in Wyche's tenure. "But the thing I hope people see in Sam is the human side. He didn't sleep much, and I know many mornings he'd be out in Cincinnati, giving money or sandwiches to the homeless, or just listening to their stories. He cared so much more about people, about relationships, and in particular about racial relationships. People were much more important to Sam than football."      He then coached the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for four seasons before beginning a career as an NFL TV analyst. His final NFL stint came in 2005 and 2006 as quarterbacks coach of the Buffalo Bills. Then he coached at his adopted hometown Pickens High School.      His time in Buffalo was about when Wyche contracted the degenerative heart disease cardiomyopathy. As the disease progressed over the next 10 years, he knew one day he would need a transplant. That day came in 2016, and he went to a Charlotte hospital that September to wait for a transplant. With Wyche's time very short, he got the transplant on Sept. 13. In his last three years, Wyche became a fervent advocate for organ donation. At that time, he said, "If I told you that you have a chance to save another person's life … and you're going to pass, and you're not going to need your heart anymore, or your liver, or your pancreas, you would give it in a heartbeat. All you do is go by the DMV and get an insignia put on your driver's license. It doesn't cost a dime. You have a chance to save somebody's life … Infants can donate a body part. A 71-year-old man can do the same."      Born in Atlanta in 1945, Wyche played football and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at Furman University. He later got his Masters in business administration at the University of South Carolina.      Wyche is survived by his wife of 54 years, Jane Underwood Wyche, of Pickens; his daughter Kerry Wyche, of Velva, ND, and her children, Ryan, Caroline, and Hank Bodine; his son Zak Wyche and his wife Jennifer of Cincinnati, OH and their children Maddy, Sammy, and Jack Wyche. He is also survived by his brother Bubba Wyche and his wife Lindy of Atlanta, GA.      Sam was firm in his Christian faith and believed that you preach your own funeral everyday by your faith and actions. In honor of his wishes, no services will be held.      Memorials may be made to the Sam Wyche Scholarship Fund at Furman University, 3300 Poinsett Highway, Greenville, SC 29613, Donate Life www.DonateLife.net, or to Rock Springs Baptist Church, 201 Rock Springs Road, Easley, SC 29640.
