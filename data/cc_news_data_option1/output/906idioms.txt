The coronavirus has been tricky to keep from spreading due to the fact that these 82 percent only experience mild symptoms, believing themselves to be fit to get out and about, thus spreading the virus to other people. With other outbreaks of Coronavirus such as SARS, it did not spread on the same scale as COVID-19 due to patients becoming very ill very quickly.

YSRCP activists staged protests across the State on Thursday against the alleged attempts of TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu to stall the reservations being given to SCs, STs and BCs.                           They said that Mr. Naidu had approached the Supreme Court challenging the High Court order that favoured 59.85% reservations. The result was that it was truncated to 50%, they alleged.                          While the YSRCP government took steps for implementing the court verdict, Mr. Naidu unleashed a false propaganda that it was the YSRCP that cheated the BCs, they contended.                          Addressing the media in Vijayawada, Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana and MLA Kolusu Parthasaradhi said that in the present instance, a TDP-backed leader had approached HC questioning the validity of the reservations for the BCs.                          They said that if the local body elections were not completed by the end of this month, a sum of ₹4,000 crore, which was due from the 14th Finance Commission, would not be released by the Centre.                           “Mr. Naidu has conspired to drag the process of elections by filing a petition in the court to put the government in the dock,” they alleged.                          The protesters said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy gave four Deputy CM posts to SCs, STs, BCs and minorities and 60% of the Cabinet berths to members of those communities. “This reflected his sincerity to politically empower these sections that are numerically strong but faced injustices,” they added.                          It was Mr. Naidu who harmed the interests of the SCs, STs and BCs, and he pretended to be concerned with the fallout of the court judgment on the empowerment of the BCs and others, they alleged.

And now we have doctor -- hate the New York Presbyterian Hospital here with us now on set to give us some advice on how to protect ourselves. And our families accident thank you so much for being on we appreciate it thanks for having we have received questions from viewers and so I basically just won a relayed them to you and see if you're able to answer some of these our first person's asking. How worried does someone who is immune compromised have to be about -- ninety. So immune compromised. Patients are people who have underlying illnesses cancers transplant things that have them on immune suppression. Those people have more concerns they are certainly more vulnerable to diseases is why we're seeing these outbreaks in hospitals and nursing homes more commonly. And as someone else is asking thousands of mail packages come from China and are delivered every day should be weed we be worried about the virus being on these packages so so far the CDC and the WH are both saying that we do not need to worry about packages you know I think this is similar transmission is the flow it's not like you don't open packages coming from all over the country because someone may have had the flu who sent him we don't think it's going to be in packages we don't particularly about long on surfaces are for the most part we're saying Sato here. Back the nearest my daughter safely home in Pennsylvania on spring break she's scheduled to return to Florida this weekend should hot let her go or should they keep her here because. Florida has case is Pennsylvania and does not. We all want to keep our kids back on the right side and I think scares but I think that probably the best advice is we should let people go. You know there are cases an actor Eddie cases in every state pretty Stan there's no safe spot her saying. I think people have to live their lives there's going to be a lot of exposure to similar to the flow I think it's times like your daughter compact. And we're seeing an uptick of cases here in New York City someone's asking should people who ride the near city subways. Be worried about corona virus and of course this can apply to any major city with public transportation right I mean look. Public transportation places where large groups are congregating as always going to be a place for you can get diseases and viruses transmitted easily. Touching the subway pole sitting next to people but again think of it like the flow you don't ride the subway. You don't not ride the subway during flu season because you're worried that you're gonna catch the floats so I would. You know proceed with caution wash your hands very carefully always wash before and after Wear gloves on the assembly if you want. There's no indication to Wear masks right now in fact we really have to protect our. You know health care workers and not overuse personal protective equipment that they mean there's really a shortage actually going on so. I tell people it's fine to travels fight to take the subway if there's some change and that. Recommendation. A let us. And this next hearing is not in an area that currently is reporting cases that is saying just be prepared. When corona virus hits our area what should I be sure to have on hand and house. So I have told my patients and people I take care we have things like Tylenol and now. Ibuprofen and motor trend soups things that you would want to have if you were sick and needed wanna leave the house to go out and get it there's no real. There's no cure for that there's no special treatment but especially as people start to go out and panic shopping want to make sure you have the basics in terms of fever reduction cough production things like anything that you would need immediately that I have to -- yet exactly. And then I'm curious myself I have a little one at home and lots of other parents do and they hand washing advice works great for adults but. For my little guy I can't wash his hands and Alan and I don't wanna put hand sanitizing on the because he puts his hands it is now write your baby weights and effective alternative or what can you do in fact. You can use baby wipes you can use like the wet winds things like at that have you know some mild soaps and on to clean up my dad your right you shouldn't be putting up corral or any of the hand sanitize or is on children can put it in their mouth but you can't put a little bit on until you wiping yourself where it's dry so that once it's dry and evaporated it's safe but again you have to eat it caution. And of course the big stress in all of this has been people worried about catching the virus but. Those worries the concerned about catching the virus can breed stress so what can people do to make sure that they're mentally healthy amid this outbreak. Look it's good to talk with your friends but also you have to have some perspective here I mean we're talking about. A virus that has infected a lot of people but not as many people as things like the flu there have been a number of deaths which are all tragic but in general the death rate is relatively low compared to other illnesses that we've seen in the world. You know I want people to have about understanding that as we test more which hopefully will be wrapped up in the next few weeks for gonna seal homer people that are testing positive with mild symptoms. So try to reassure yourself take a bath Medicaid. You know talk to your friends that don't get all over excited trying to you know limit your exposure to. Sources that are not reliable sources of information so it well. As we see we may see a big uptick in cases of doesn't necessarily mean. The number of cases are exploding just that we're testing Morse are going to find more right we're not all gonna die of corona virus okay this is going to be this may in an in factor you know when we look. I have not yeah. I'll get a dime corona virus audited eyebrow and a virus you know think of H1N1 you know that was 645 to sixty million Americans were infected with you know it's like think what happened is we've got so much information coming out of China that was scary initially. And it's really shaped how everybody feels about it and look it is a serious fire as it can affect people a serious way. But if you looked at how many people we could know right now how many Americans actually have it. And compared to how many deaths there are I think people would feel much more real short time we'll thank you imagine handing me appreciated the issue.

It will be the top two seeds battling for a Division 3 district title 7 p.m. Friday at Centreville as Centreville topped White Pigeon, 63-57, in the opening semifinal, while Schoolcraft downed Marcellus, 57-8, in the second game Wednesday night.
 Centreville 63, White Pigeon 57
 They split in the regular season and battle number three was worthy of two teams that came in with 16-plus victories as Centreville outlasted White Pigeon 63-57 to win and advance.
 "We told kids after the last time we played them and they got us, we just didn't play with a lot of heart that game and we had to put it on the line," Bulldog coach Jill Peterson said. "This is the time to do it. You prepare 19 weeks for this moment and we had the last run today, but White Pigeon played incredibly well. The had a great game and knocked down shots when they need to."
 Lady Chiefs coach Brooke McClure knew her team left it out on the court.
 "Centreville is (20-1) for a reason, but I'm proud of our girls," she said. "We worked really hard and fought a good fight, but just came up short at the end there."
 White Pigeon (16-5) was able to jump out to a quick 8-0 lead by playing aggressive and moving the ball.
 "I was proud of the girls for not playing afraid most of the time," McClure said. "And to just come out and score. We knew they were going to double and face guard Claycee (West). I was proud of my other girls for stepping up and trying to take charge."
 After Melissa Hayden scored to put the Chiefs ahead 8-0, Centreville got a 3-pointer from Olivia Deeds to break the scoring drought. But the Chiefs quickly answered with a triple by Lauren Dressler to rebuild the eight-point lead.
 "Coming into the game, Claycee the last two games had shot 50 percent against us and the rest of the team shot 18," Peterson said. "We knew we were going to take our chances and we knew it could hurt us, but we were still erring on the side of Claycee's a great player and we needed to shut her down and have other kids step up. But we had kids step up on our end too and I think that was the difference."
 A late three-point play by Joanna Larsen and a split at the line by Amy Carpenter help the Bulldogs close the deficit to 15-11 after one quarter.
 West got a putback basket to move the Chiefs ahead, 17-11, but Centreville fought back to tie the game at 19-19 on a steal and layup by Deeds.
 Moments later, Larsen connected on a pair from the charity stripe to put the Bulldogs ahead, but West answered with a 3-pointer to give White Pigeon a brief 22-21 lead with just over three minutes remaining in the second quarter.
 The Lady Bulldogs retook the lead with a 8-0 run to build a 29-22 advantage. The run was capped by another Deeds triple, who finished with six on the game.
 The Chiefs got treys from West and Rainie Atherton to close the halftime deficit to 31-28. They finished with nine total as a team with Atherton, West and Dressler each canning three.
 Another Bulldog 8-0 run to open the third quarter gave them their largest lead of the game, 39-28.
 However, White Pigeon rebounded with a 15-4 run to tie the game 43-43. A three-point play by Atherton with Reyna Fielis picking up the assist was the play that knotted the game.
 But Larsen scored off a feed from Kenleigh West-Wing and added another bucket inside to give Centreville a 47-43 lead heading into the final eight minutes.
 White Pigeon opened the fourth quarter with a Dressler triple, Fielis steal and score and Atherton trey to retake the lead, 51-47.
 Deeds answered with back-to-back 3-pointers with Grace Edwards and West-Wing picking up assists to retake the lead, 53-51.
 After the teams exchanged split at the line, the Bulldogs closed the game on the shoulders of their senior center Larsen. She scored her teams final nine points in the paint as the Chiefs limited size was unable to slow her down at the end.
 "She played really well," McClure said of Larsen. "She's a tough player, hard to stop. Doubled her, tripled her and you can only do so much. She just came out and played the post really tough."
 She finished with a career high in points.
 "I didn't even realize how many she had while we were going and I looked at the book and she finishes with 33, I imagine that's a career-high and Olivia with 22 is probably a career-high too," Peterson said. "I think we had some career-high assists, I haven't looked at everything. But Kenleigh did a great job distributing the ball, Grace did a good job distributing the ball. We played the defensive plan we were supposed to play, White Pigeon did what they were supposed to do and came really close to winning tonight."
 West-Wing added four points for the Bulldogs, Faith Edwards had two and Paige Walton and Carpenter each had a free throw.
 Atherton topped White Pigeon with 16 points, West finished with 15, Dressler tossed in 13, Melissa Hayden added seven and Fielis had six.
 "White Pigeon made a great transition from last year to this year and Brooke is doing a great job with them," Peterson said. "Claycee, you can tell she loves basketball and she's still putting time with that and now that she's going to Taylor, I'm really excited for her. A big fan of Taylor University and excited to cheer for her and not have to play against her."
 Larsen collected 15 boards for Centreville, Grace Edwards grabbed eight and Deeds had six. West-Wing finished with seven assists and three steals, while Grace Edwards added six assists.
 Hayden corralled nine rebounds for White Pigeon, West added five and Dressler collected four. West added four assists and Fielis ended with three.
 The Lady Chiefs may have surprised some with their success this season, but McClure knew her team was capable of the success they attained.
 "Actually I knew how good we were, how hard we worked this off-season and in our scrimmages and stuff," she said. "And how we could really play when we were at full strength. But at the beginning of the season, we had a few starters injured, so it was a little bit rocky and we didn't really flow until we got everybody strong and healthy again. I knew how good we could be, but it was really fun to see their hard work come to fruition and payoff with some wins finally."
 Schoolcraft 57, Marcellus 8
 Schoolcraft's defense aided a 23-0 start on the way to the Eagles 57-8 win over Marcellus in the second semifinal Wednesday night.
 "We knew defensively they were going to transition us and we were prepared for that," Wildcat coach Don Price said. "We tried to prepare for that kind of pressure and obviously we weren't up to the task. We knew that we had to knock down shots tonight to have a chance. They got off to a fast start, we struggled offensively to get anything going and it set the tone for the rest of the night."
 Western Michigan signee Gabi Saxman jump started her team getting three quick steals to give the Eagles a 7-0 lead. She scored 14 of her game-high 18 points in the opening stanza.
 "Their pressure obviously took us out of what we wanted to do, what we planned to do," Price said. "We were just trying to be aggressive and get to the basket. We got that a couple of times and weren't able to knock a couple layups down. When you're getting beat and don't make those shots, it's even more defeating when those buckets don't go in."
 Schoolcraft (19-2) led 23-2 after one quarter and 40-4 at halftime.
 Marcellus (8-12) despite its' shooting woes continued to battle in the second half and Price was pleased with his team's effort.
 "That's what we just talked about in there," he said. "We're proud of the second half, we said we just have to play for pride and really happy with us not quitting. We could have quit."
 Mackenzie Miller added 11 points for the Eagles, Anna Schuppel tallied seven, Savannah Seath notched six, Allie Walther finished with five, Adrienne Rosey and Alison Bailey each added four and Madison Ingle had two.
 JoLeigh Small scored four points for the Wildcats, Savannah Lowery added three and Emma Holmes had a free throw.

It is precisely because knowledge is power that government officials can sometimes be so reluctant to share it.
   
 The silent infiltration of the COVID-19 virus into our communities is a pertinent example of this instinct to contain useful information, even though when it comes to public health everyone should be on a need-to-know basis. Journalists in the Herald-Tribune newsroom spent Sunday fruitlessly seeking to confirm the galloping rumor that a possibly infected patient was under quarantine at Doctors Hospital of Sarasota. It was not until late Sunday night that Gov. Ron DeSantis approved a press release.
   
 There is no good reason for such reticence and stonewalling, because rumor is always a greater hazard to public health than the truth can be. Nor would it be a violation of patient privacy to release more details about those "underlying health conditions" that appear to make a life-or-death difference in the outcomes of this infection.
   
 American adults deserve to be trusted, as a rule, with the facts that drive the decisions of their elected officials. If not, why should we have any right to elect them? And trust works both ways: A government that stints on the release of public information eventually erodes its own ability to lead.
   
 There are some legitimate circumstances under which officials are right to withhold facts from the public. But by far the most common motive for government secrecy is that telling the truth would make the government look bad.
   
 This certainly seems to be the operational mode behind a coverup of Florida's ongoing struggle against outside interference in its election process. As reported by the Tallahassee Democrat's Jeffrey Schweers, and published in the Feb. 26 edition of The Ledger, opacity about these hacking efforts was imposed from the top down. The state threatened to deny necessary federal funding to any county elections supervisor who did not sign a nondisclosure agreement -- effectively hindering them in their duty to manage a process that cannot exist without accountability and transparency.
   
 Schweers tells a tale of federal investigators swooping into Florida wearing a cloak of invisibility woven by the Department of Homeland Security. As state leaders were briefed and "cyber navigators" were trained to detect new assaults on the elections system, this idea of a hush-hush atmosphere was applied to anything and everything having to do with voting security.
   
 "Elections supervisors had to sign the NDA to see what the cyber navigators discovered during their risk assessment, according to an email they received in July and obtained by USA TODAY Network-Florida," Schweers wrote. "Two reminders went out in September to supervisors who still hadn't signed the agreement."
   
 "It just felt coerced," Polk County Supervisor of Elections Lori Edwards told Schweers. "We have a broad public records law for a reason, so having to sign a nondisclosure agreement didn't sit well with me … not only to receive funds, but information too."
   
 The uneven results of this suppression attempt are revealed by the wide discrepancies in elections supervisors' responses to a straightforward public records request on what they knew before 2016 and how they have spent money to secure their systems. From the unredacted records that were provided, it does appear that our vote tabulation process is now safer than it was for the last presidential election.
   
 But it remains to be seen whether the unnecessary insistence on concealing its previous vulnerabilities will do more harm than good.

It's one of those extra special Friday nights at the Fillmore in San Francisco, with one of the longest-running bands in popular music back at the scene where they helped forge the psychedelic rock 'n' roll counterculture in the 1960s. Hot Tuna have now been rocking the planet for more than 50 years, and there are very few of their peers who can say the same. This date has therefore been circled on the calendar for some time as the band returns to the Fillmore for the first time in three years, now making it their seventh decade playing at this hallowed hall.
 Guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady came of age rocking the San Francisco scene with the Jefferson Airplane, where they helped create one of the most influential sounds in rock history. But the Airplane's music was about more than just a fresh new sound. The band was also at the epicenter of the San Francisco socio-cultural revolution that swept the nation, leading to the massive Woodstock Festival, where the Airplane turned in one of the weekend's top performances. The Airplane's revolutionary vibe was a genuine force in the pop culture world in the group's peak years from 1966-1970.
 Then even as the Airplane was starting to fracture, Jack and Jorma went on to form Hot Tuna and have kept rocking as a force of nature ever since. The band is typically a power trio these days with drummer Justin Guip providing the backbeat to Casady's ever-dynamic low end and Kaukonen's bluesy guitar virtuosity. A "Been So Long" opener sets an appropriate tone for this return to rock's most sacred sonic temple, and the trio is off and running. Jorma starts the show on acoustic guitar, where he puts on a fingerpicking clinic on tunes like "Living Just for You and Me". The trio catches a great groove on the upbeat melodic number with Jorma singing of how "it takes a long time to be free".

Compared to Lawyer X, the Pell case, perhaps, doesn’t raise quite the same set of concerns.  The mainstream media, with its embedded progressivism and animus against the Catholic Church, has simply gone on strike in relation to investigating how an innocent man came to be hounded in the absence of a crime, then denied justice, and what his appalling conviction means for justice in Australia, for example in relation to reversing the onus of proof in cases of “he said/she said” sexual abuse.  Australia’s system of justice has been placed under the microscope, the country’s reputation for a fair go shot down in the manic desire of so many players to hold the Catholic Church leadership to account for crimes real and imagined.

Coming to the courts, despite the regular output of high-minded judgments, they too have failed miserably in ensuring police accountability. Our courts are prompt in passing sweeping judgements about certain aspects of police functioning such as arrests and encounters. But they are extremely ineffective in doing their basic job of dispensing justice in a time-bound manner, or in ensuring that the police receive proper backing in ensuring the rule of law. One example is the frequent misuse of Section 321 CrPC by all governments to withdraw riot-related cases with the consent of the court. All parties use this section to withdraw cases against their activists when they come to power. This gives rioters a powerful sense of impunity. Unless rioters know that they will face trial without fail, rioting will continue to serve as a viable tool of political mobilisation. The Supreme Court ought to frame strict guidelines that regulate the use of this provision of law.

Whatever the outcome of the upcoming High Court appeal by Cardinal Pell against his conviction on sex abuse charges, and despite the continuing social media tirades against the man and the undying hatred expressed by Pell haters against his small band of public defenders, there has been a recent, ever-so- subtle turn in elite opinion towards the possibility of an Alfred Dreyfus/Lindy Chamberlain scenario here.  That the man may have been wrongly convicted.  This is evidenced by some support for Pell’s innocence from unlikely quarters, and suggests hope against hope for justice.  Andrew Bolt has commented on it.  Yet, despite these tentative signs of hope, and the pleasant surprise, against the odds, that the High Court even decided to hear an appeal, there is still a massive job of work to be done in order to restore the Cardinal’s reputation.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who presented the Budget wearing a green shawl on Thursday, proposed to bring about a new agricultural policy to revive the economy.                           The proposed policy, among other things, will prescribe measures to encourage water security, concepts of land bank and mass cultivation, besides micro-irrigation, processing of farm produce, and marketing. The larger intention is to provide the status of industry to agriculture and horticulture, notes the Budget. The State is also set to announce another policy which will prescribe crops suitable for specific regions based on recommendation by the Land Resources Registry, availability of water, and soil health.                          Repeating an earlier announcement, the Chief Minister proposed to waive interest on default farm loans obtained from cooperative bodies for purchase of farm equipment. He also proposed to provide an interest exemption to the extent of 5% on loans taken by arecanut growers up to a maximum loan amount of ₹2 lakh availed of from cooperative bodies.                          Karnataka being a State that has large tracts of drought-prone land, the Budget announced World Bank-funded new multi-State watershed area development project (REWARD) for the next six years to assist farming on 10 lakh hectares of land. Jalamrutha project will be implemented in 810 small watersheds, covering four lakh hectares in the next three years.                          To take services to farmers’ doorstep, it has been proposed to launch “mobile agricultural health clinics” for soil and water testing besides providing various technical information relating to insecticides and diseases. However, there is no mention of size of the scheme and financial allocation.                          To address the issue of post-harvest losses in the horticulture sector, the Budget has proposed to establish 10 cold storage units with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes each under public-private partnership in the APMC yards at a cost of ₹75 crore.                          It has also proposed to strengthen HOPCOMS besides utilising the Krishi Rail scheme of the Centre to transport flowers and horticultural produce from Bengaluru to Delhi, Mumbai, and Thiruvananthapuram.                          The cultivation of teff, chia, and quinoa too has been brought under the ‘Raitha Siri’ scheme under which incentive will be provided for cultivation of drought-resistant varieties such as minor millets. Similarly, ₹200 crore has been earmarked for encouraging organic farming.

You dig a little deeper now into that question about travel because of course as people travel from country to country. We see this virus spreading so. As Karen mention lots of people are wondering is it safe to travel at all we're gonna bring in business an aviation reporter Mark Stuart here to break that part down forests. Mark this seems to be such a prevalent question and this time mere a lot of people like to get away. I know that the president met with the airlines CEOs yesterday what did we learn from that meeting in terms of how they're responding to this. Watching the big take away from the meeting was to let the administration but also the rest of us who travel that the airlines are fit to fly. And their takings have pretty aggressive steps Alaska Airlines for example. Is bringing in scientists from the University of Washington to make sure that their plea their planes are clean and safe. In fact if your on Alaska and you want another Coke you're gonna have to get a brand new cup they're not recycling. In addition carriers such as delta which fly those long haul international route they're using what amount to be. Fog machines to disinfect the planes after some of those long haul trips. It's important that they are out there because the last thing they want is for people to be afraid of flying and we know there's been so much scrutiny about how this disease travels in such. Travel numbers are down so the airlines want people to know in addition to the White House that it's safe. And so it the concern is being on the plane itself but then also once you arrive. If you have to get somewhere in the next 12 month summer in the near future you cancel. I think at the end of the day as the doctor just said you have to do with. What is comfortable for you it's not a one size fits all approach the good news is is that if you have some concerns in you are reticent. You can cancel to a degree to airlines are offering some flexibility. Its interest in a note though it airports around the world know people are on edge many airports are handing out. Free jell I just read that the airport in Denver as you board the plane is heading up those bleach whites see you can clean the seat of your plate but at the end of today yet do. With what feels right for you and your family. And for many people that may be staying home fewer people are booking trips and that means we're start misty some prices go down. If people feel up to it is this a good time to book travel and it does that apply to the near future or travel that's. Our events share unfortunately the airlines are not like the grocery store or the mall when demand goes down. Sales prices dropping not necessarily bright on Q. Talking to economists talking to industry experts they say sometime in the next two weeks if we see a price drop that's when it will really hit. Right now jet fuel is cheap so that's one thing that's helping the airlines or they don't wanna drop prices. Unless they absolutely have to you with that said last night Alaska Airlines was offering twenty dollar. One way fares between some cities. But I think that's more of a novelty as opposed to what's going to be the door OK so this isn't necessarily. A time for bargain hunters when it comes airfare at least there's always a bargain regardless of the health of the country. So if you want to travel absolutely go look. And then. For when you reach your destination is there something you can do before you leave to kind of if your mind a little bit or set set you know parameters in place in case something happens when you are right. Right if you're traveling with the domestic United States I mean fortunately we have a very. Large list at health care providers whether they beat the emergency clinics we see here in New York or or doctors' offices. I think the real question is if you are traveling to an international destination. Do you have a plan B or place to go to if you are sick sometimes just being prepared makes you feel better even if you happen any listen just for your peace of mind. But a lot of hospitals a lot of physicians have colleagues around the world. If you're going to London for business trip and you.

_Darkness Brings the Wonders Home_ is the Smoke Fairies' first album in four years. The South London duo recorded the tracks in another fog-laden city, Seattle, with producer Phil Ek (the Black Angels, Fleet Foxes, the Shins). Perhaps the nebulous environs of the New World rubbed off on the music. There is a fuzziness to the sound. The lyrics are indistinct, even as the words are carefully articulated. It takes a second or two after initially hearing them to decipher what was sung. The accompanying instruments have a wavering existence produced by the repetition of single notes in different pitches to create overtones. As the name of the final cut "Super Tremolo" suggests, this was deliberately done to create a nuanced effect. Both Blamire and Davies play a number of instruments, although it's unclear who contributed what sounds here.
 While sometimes it is necessary to squint to see things clearly, Smoke Fairies imply the opposite is also true. One has to stop focusing on the trees to see the forest. For example, the song "Out of the Woods" tells the tale of a lover whose directness causes problems. Sometimes the straightest path is one where the branches and other obstacles get in the way. Detours inspire an increase in passion. Intimacy gets lost when things are too straightforward.
 Overall, the album alludes to the danger of looking too closely in the light. It's only in the darkness where one can experience the marvelous. The duo note that it is in dreams where one can be safely unrestrained. "Don't You Want to Be Out of Control" they ask on the evocative track of that name. The answer to the rhetorical question lies in one's disconnection from reality. This doesn't require drugs, although sometimes the answer can be found in a pill. Existing in space and time creates its own opportunities, whether one is waiting for an elevator or sitting in a coffee shop. Illumination requires just turning off the lights.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed and sent to President Donald Trump an $8.3 billion funding bill to help state and local governments combat the spreading coronavirus, as public health experts outlined efforts to rapidly accelerate testing for the disease.
 By a vote of 96-1, the Senate approved legislation that was overwhelmingly passed on Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
 Republican Senator Rand Paul, who objected to spending the money without first reducing federal spending elsewhere, was the lone dissenter.
 Trump is expected to sign the bill into law so that the billions of dollars can flow toward developing vaccines against the highly contagious coronavirus and aiding international efforts to control transmission.
 Trump initially requested $2.5 billion, with much of that coming from already appropriated funds.
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said of the emergency funding bill, "It's a serious agreement to meet a serious challenge and today we will send it to President Trump's desk."
 Action by Congress comes as U.S. deaths related to coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday and new cases were identified on both coasts - around New York City and Los Angeles.
 New York state's confirmed coronavirus cases have doubled to 22, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Thursday.
 Washington state has been hardest hit so far. Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell said the legislation will provide $11.5 million to help her state's health department respond to the crisis.
 "We need these funds. We need them now and we need other states to heed the early testing that would have been helpful in our state and now may be helpful in yours," Cantwell said.
 The money to fight coronavirus includes over $3 billion for research and development of vaccines, test kits and medical treatments. Another $2.2 billion would aid public health activities on prevention, preparedness and response to outbreaks.
 The federal government would dedicate $1.25 billion in coming weeks and months to help international efforts aimed at reining in the virus, which was first detected late last year in China and has since spread around the globe.
 Earlier on Thursday, U.S. health officials briefed House members one day after Vice President Mike Pence held separate meetings with House Democrats and Republicans to discuss plans for responding to any coronavirus outbreak.
 Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, were among those taking questions from House members on Thursday.
 Representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs a House panel that oversees federal spending on health programs, said she did not get satisfactory answers from officials about access to testing and diagnostics and how to help people who do not get paid sick days through their jobs or who have no health insurance.
 Republican Representative Tom Cole, however, gave an upbeat assessment. "We're still behind the curve there, but the sense is we'll be moving pretty quickly and able to catch up," Cole said. He was referring to the growing number of tests that will be manufactured and could total around 1 million by next week.
 Besides dispatching money throughout the United States, the bill approved by Congress also would provide for low-interest federal loans to businesses affected by a coronavirus outbreak. (Reporting by Richard Cowan, David Morgan and Lisa Lambert; Editing by Dan Grebler and Jonathan Oatis)

NEWARK, N.J. -- After sitting out the past two games, Jordan Kyrou looks to be back in the lineup for the Blues for Friday night when they face the Devils at the Prudential Center.

 Kyrou missed the Dallas game because he was sick and then sat out the Rangers game on Tuesday. Berube said Kyrou was well enough to have played that game if needed, but Jacob de la Rose had shown well in the previous game and Berube stuck with him.
 "The first day I couldn't get out of bed," Kyrou said. "I had like no energy at all, no strength. I feel good now. I had strep throat. I was pretty sick. My energy felt good and I feel pretty close to normal."

Operation Plangere found the initial report, which caused such consternation in the halls of power, to have been wildly exaggerated.

Jorma switches over to a gorgeous Gibson Thunderbird, and the trio gets down to rocking out on "Can't Be Satisfied", with the guitarist singing about his worried mind as he rips melty hot licks with one of the sweetest tones in rock. Many of the usual suspects from the local classic rock crowd are here getting their groove on, and an old school Fillmore dance party is in session. The festive vibe continues with "Talking 'Bout You", a swaggering rocker that sounds kind of like a cross between a Chuck Berry tune and a 1974 era song from Aerosmith or KISS. Jorma's melodic fingerpicking is further featured on "Roads and Roads" and "Hesitation Blues", before dipping into some deep electric blues on "Ode to Billy Dean".
 Jack takes over the cosmos on "Bowlegged Woman, Knock Kneed Man", throwing down a massive groove to ignite the dance floor like the god of thunder that he is. This is power trio rock at its finest, with Jack crushing the monster groove while Jorma rips smoldering riffage as sonic sparks fly. Few bassists dare to play a semi-hollow body instrument, but Jack makes it sound as easy as breathing as he conjures one of the greatest bass tones in rock history throughout the night. "Trial By Fire" keeps things rocking as Jorma lays down sweet melodic riffage over a mid-tempo groove to paint a compelling sonic landscape.
 "Sleep Song" is another gem with Jorma's sweet licks and Jack's warm low end coalescing for melodic magic on an infectious groove with a swinging backbeat. The set is really catching fire now as the trio moves into a surging "Walkin' Blues" that explodes with glorious blues power. It's another showcase for Jack's mesmerizing bass power, with Jorma adding some scintillating slide guitar while Justin snaps the dynamic beat back and forth. It's like night and day from the Grateful Dead's version, as Hot Tuna transmogrifies the Robert Johnson blues classic with a Zeppish swagger.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked officials to increase the strength of the enforcement wing of the Prohibtion and Excise Department at the earliest.                           At a review meeting on Thursday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the services of two-thirds of department’s staff could be utilised in the enforcement wing.                           ## ‘Adhere to SOPs’                           “The targets set can be achieved if there is a coordination between the enforcement and other wings. Efficiency can be improved by adopting standard operating procedures (SOPs),” he said, and added that the officials should strictly adhere to the SOPs.                           Stating that illegal sand mining and illicit brewing were impediments in the smooth functioning of the administration, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the Police and the Prohibition and Excise departments would have to work in tandem.                           “Control of belt shops is the primary duty of the Mahila police. The government has provided telephones to the Mahila police. Get information from them at regular intervals. Similarly, there are Mahila Mitras. Their services can also be utilised,” the Chief Minister observed.                          “At any cost, there should not be belt shops and illicit brewing in the State. Also, illegal sand mining and transportation has to be curbed. Keep a strict vigil on the border areas.

EAST LANSING, Mich. (WLNS) - Poor or limited internet access in rural homes can cause students to fall behind, according to a new report from Michigan State University's Quello Center.      The first-of-its-kind report finds that these educational setbacks can have a significant impact on academic success, college admissions and career opportunities.      "What we found really underscores the importance of home internet and digital skills for students," said doctoral student and contributor to the report Craig Robertson. "Lack of access and lower skills are related to a range of negative outcomes. These have potential consequences for students' lives now and down the road."      The report is based on data collected from 15 Michigan school districts covering Mecosta County, St. Clair County and the eastern region of the Upper Peninsula, spanning from the Tahquamenon area to St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie.

Nawaharjan sure take their sweet time. The band from Germany first appeared in 2011 with their _Into the Void_ debut EP. The initial release was limited to just 50 copies, but thankfully Nawaharjan made part of it available through their Bandcamp, presenting a work of chaotic and hectic prowess. It would only take nine years for this early promise to come full circle, as Nawaharjan now unleash their debut record _Lokabrenna_.
 Drawing influences from Norse mythology is not necessarily novel for black metal, but how Nawaharjan weave these stories in _Lokabrenna_ is quite disturbing. With each song appearing as a lock, and thus a door that Nawaharjan open wide, it follows a mystic descent through the bitter edge of black metal. The assault is devastating with opener "Warassuz", the dissonant guitars building a tempest and the anthemic vocals aptly awakening an ancient ceremony.
 The eerie sense grows stronger as the record unfolds, with the opening phrases of "Skuwwe" constructing a terrifying ambiance and the lo-fi sense of "Utfursko" further fanning its flames. It is the flow and energy of _Lokabrenna_ that make it such a captivating listen, with Nawaharjan perfecting their black metal brew. Hopefully, it will not be another nine years until we hear from them again. – _Spyros Stasis_

Mohali The three Royal Bengal tiger cubs born to white tigress Diya at the Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park, Chhatbir village, in November last year are waiting for Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to pick their names.The two male and one female cubs were born on November 17 last year, taking the orange fur of their father Aman, a Royal Bengal tiger. The tiger pair was adopted by the former tourism minister Navjot Singh Sidhu in January 2019. "We had sent a request to the chief minister (to name the cubs)," said Dr Kuldeep Kumar, principal chief conservator of forests, Punjab.A senior official, not willing to be named, said a request was sent to the chief minister (CM) in February, but they had yet to hear back from his office. "This is a big event for us as tigers have been bred successfully here after a gap of six years. So, if the CM names the little ones, it will be really grand," said the official.Diya was born at the Chhatbir zoo in 2013 to a tigress named Dolly, who had given birth to two more cubs. While Lakshy remains in Chhatbir Zoo, the other one was moved to another zoo. Aman was born in 2012 and was acquired from Khanpur Zoo in 2013. The two tigers were paired and released in the same display enclosure in January 2016.Names recommended by zoo staffThe zoo staff has already recommended a set of names. As per practice, the male cubs are named with the same first alphabet as their father's name and the females of their mother. The staff members whose suggestions will be chosen by the CM will be given incentives.Aman not allowed to meet the cubsAman has yet to meet the cubs as male tigers are known to attack their young. "We will keep him at bay till the cubs are six months old as by then they will be able to run for protective cover if he attacks," the official added. Cubs to be displayed to public soon After nearly four months of isolation, the cubs will soon be out for public display. "They will be out on display soon, but we have not finalised the date yet," said zoo field director M Sudhagar. "It's up to Diya when to take out the cubs once the enclosure is open for display," he added.

It’s become obvious that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo considers local input on major projects affecting residents in upstate New York very annoying.
 How dare we express our views on the many wind turbines and solar panels that he wants to place here! Who are we to question whether having these structures built in our communities is in our best interest?
 Mr. Cuomo wants to silence the voices of those who don’t lay down when he snaps his fingers in pursuit of his clean power agenda. He’s proposed a monstrous change to siting renewable energy projects throughout the state.
 He has proposed dramatically altering the Article 10 process by removing the two local ad hoc representatives who sit on each New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. In doing so, he’s caving in to wind and solar project developers — many of whom operate foreign-based firms — who don’t like it when residents push back against their plans. The proposed bill also would eliminate intervenor funding for participating in the process.
 A story published Feb. 27 by the Wall Street Journal presented what Mr. Cuomo believes are the “benefits” of eliminating local voices on siting boards.
 “You wouldn’t have these contentious community vs. energy-project dramas that have gone on across the state, and you could actually get it done faster,” he said.
 In other words, why put up with potential opposition? Relegate community input to the back bench so that developers can have their way.
 The governor has introduced the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act. If approved by the state Legislature as part of the proposed budget, this would establish the Office of Renewable Energy Permitting.
 The Article 10 process calls for a siting board consisting of representatives of the state departments of Public Service, Environmental Conservation, Health, Economic Development and State Energy Research and Development Authority. Two ad hoc members, each living within the affected community, also are appointed to the board.
 Mirroring the complaints of developers, Mr. Cuomo believes this process has become overly cumbersome. He wants to “streamline” it by exerting more direct control. This would expedite wind and solar applications by replacing the judgment of local residents with people whose careers he oversees.
 “The new structure created by the act centralizes renewable energy siting and permitting activities within the Department of Economic Development,” according to a news release issued Feb. 21 by the governor’s office. “The structure also creates, separately, a new program through which the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority will collaborate with the Department of Environmental Conservation and Department of Public Service to develop build-ready sites for renewable energy projects.”
 There is no doubt that the siting process takes a lot of time to complete. And there has been vocal opposition to some projects in Northern New York.
 But there’s good reason for the concern expressed by people who live in the communities that would host wind and solar farms. On this page, we have warned of how a conglomeration of wind turbines adversely affects radar capabilities for Wheeler-Sack Army Airfield at Fort Drum and the Montague Weather Station.
 And not all developers are on the up and up when it comes to revealing what they know about the impact their projects will have. Apex Clean Energy had false information about the existence of a bald eagles nest on Galloo Island in its application for a wind farm. Without local input, these factors may never have come to light.
 Lewis County Manager Ryan M. Piche told the Watertown Daily Times that as the host of some wind projects, communities there strongly support clean energy initiatives. But balancing the interests of local residents with those of developers in the Article 10 process is essential, he said.
 State lawmakers must stop this proposed legislation in its tracks. They cannot allow Mr. Cuomo to amass more power for himself by reducing our influence.
 Pursuing clean energy is the most sensible plan for New York. But this must not come at the expense of communities that must live with the consequences of Cuomo’s dreadful ideas.

As the M.D. and the Town of Pincher Creek, along with neighbouring municipalities voice their concerns regarding adequate policing in the face of the province's new police funding model, the provincial government and K Division seem to be on a different page.
 K Division has indicated to the solicitor general's office that the Pincher Creek detachment is fully staffed, prompting M.D. council to unanimously approve a letter sharing reasons why they feel that has not been the case during the February 25 meeting.
 The Town and M.D. of Pincher Creek, along with Crowsnest Pass, Nanton, Claresholm, and Fort MacLeod have vocalized the fact that police forces in their areas over past years have been understaffed to Solicitor General Doug Schweitzer during talks surrounding the new funding model.
 M.D. of Pincher Creek CAO Troy MacCulloch said despite K Division's stance that the detachment is fully staffed, certain events over past years have proved strenuous on service levels.
 "(Livingstone-MacLeod MLA Roger Reid) was quite disturbed when he heard that our detachment was understaffed, Crowsnest was understaffed, and throughout Willow Creek and the whole area it sounded like they were understaffed," said MacCulloch.
 "We heard it ourselves, from our members, that during the summer (of 2019) they had staffing shortages," said MacCulloch.
 Pincher Creek's detachment is supposed to have 11 officers, including an enhanced officer.
 MacCulloch said that seemingly due to internal reasons, the Pincher Creek detachment has not been working at a full service levels.
 "We heard numerous times last year that we were down to four (officers), yet when the solicitor general calls K Division, they said… we were at full staff --that's not necessarily the case," said MacCulloch.
 "The solicitor general mentioned this… and said that if we were down to four, then it may have been some detachment issues, dealing with vacations and some other internal things," he said.
 MacCulloch said that it would be improper for the M.D. to comment on the internal workings of Pincher Creek's RCMP detachment, but added that at the end of the day it's the jurisdiction that suffers.
 "That's fine. It is what it is, and it wouldn't be right for us to comment further. From what K Division is telling the solicitor general's office is that we have all positions filled," said MacCulloch.
 "We may have 11 names on there, but either because of vacations or other things, you don't have 10 people available, and that's the issue. I know for sure on rodeo weekend, they said we had two officers," he said.
 "If K Divison and the solicitor general's office are on the same page with that, I'm not sure. That's between the RCMP and the province to figure out, but sadly we were the ones that had to reduce service."
 Reeve Brian Hammond said that while the M.D. can't speak to the RCMP's operational requirements, a lack of policing ends up affecting residents.
 "How many (officers) are boots on the ground? And that's a presuming question --I don't know how we can deal with the awkwardness of that, because don't know what their manning requirements are, and nor should we," said Hammond.
 "We can only say that this is what we got, which impacts, one way or the other, the people that we represent," he said.
 Hammond presented the motion for the M.D. to inform the solicitor general's office of why they feel that police services haven't been at full levels, as they are unable to present any further information regarding the internal aspects of the Pincher Creek Detachment.
 "(Schweitzer) is just an elected official trying to do his job. If we can help, than maybe we can at least explain why we we're not the voice to actually give that information, although we feel that at certain times we've experienced that there have been shortfalls," said Hammond.
