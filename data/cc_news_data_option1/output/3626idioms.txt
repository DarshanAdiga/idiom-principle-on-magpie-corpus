_Dear editor,_
 We've seen the pattern countless times: He projects his nasty character onto others.
 The man who called Ted Cruz "Lying Ted" has told more than 20,000 lies while in office. The president who doesn't start working until lunchtime calls Joe Biden "lazy." Now, he's saying the election will be rigged, and just to make sure, he is telling his followers to vote twice, by mail and in person.
 His shameful advocacy is illegal; he is inciting voters to commit a felony. It creates the very rigging that he will claim when disparaging the election results. He is anti-democracy.
 Our health, safety and democracy are on the ballot this November. Will the perpetrator who blames problems he has created on others be reelected, or will Americans reclaim our democracy and our decency? A landslide repudiation of this trumpery can rescue our future.
 Let every voter's ballot count, but only once.

Naturally, then, the court's four Republicans are very interesting in hearing their case.

For while Madeira and the Azores will be excluded from the quarantine list under the government’s new ‘island policy’, it will come as little comfort to the vast majority of holidaymakers, and the embattled travel and tourism sector, which has seen the 2020 summer holiday season effectively crushed.

Presente all’incontro di oggi nella sede di Ats Insubria anche Annalisa Donadini, Direttore UOC Medicina Preventiva nelle Comunità che si è invece soffermata sull’ultima e più recente riunione con i dirigenti scolastici e provveditori. “È stato consegnato a tutte le scuole un primo documento per cercare di garantire il diritto allo studio in totale sicurezza e il diritto alla salute – ha detto Donadini – L’obiettivo di tutte le norme di sicurezza, igieniche e comportamentali studiate è ovviamente quello di limitare al minimo i disagi per gli alunni e i loro genitori e quello di non chiudere la scuola”. Obiettivo raggiungibile però solo se “tutti si uniranno per affrontare una situazione del tutto insolita”.
