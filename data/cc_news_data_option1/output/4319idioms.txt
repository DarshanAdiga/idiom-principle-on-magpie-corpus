And it wasn't that he dropped out of high school and did only a few semesters of college, or that he was once fired by an employer for reading on the job. These were small missteps and shortcomings that were basically inconsequential in the long run. The larger issue is that, in his own view, William Faulkner was a failed poet.

China's Communist leadership will discuss Xi Jinping's ambitious carbon neutral pledge in talks that began Monday on the country's economic strategy for the next five years.
 The climate goals, which challenge the world's biggest polluter to reach peak emissions in 2030 and go carbon neutral 30 years later, are the most concrete environmental action announced by Beijing yet but are thin on public detail.
 The latest plenary will discuss the country's new five year plan, to take effect from 2021, which is expected to flesh out how a country that accounts for a quarter of the planet's greenhouse gases will rewire the economy to meet Xi's targets.
 The opaque meetings are always held behind closed doors, without media access, and a statement outlining decisions made by the leadership is usually published after the gathering concludes.
 China's draft five year plan will then be presented to its rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, for formal approval.
 The carbon promise, announced last month in a speech by Xi to the United Nations, came as a surprise as China has relied heavily on coal to spur its economic emergence from poverty to superpower status over the last few decades.
 Its five year plans are "not designed to attract votes or score political points as is done in the West by some politicians (but) are aimed at realising the people's aspirations for a better life", said official news agency Xinhua over the weekend.
 Xinhua said more than one million suggestions for the five year plan had been submitted online in August, and that input had come from universities, think tanks and other official bodies.
 The new plan will be the country's 14th since the Communist government was established in 1949.
 The state news agency said on Sunday that pollution targets in the last plan had been met, and urban residents in China "now breathe in unpolluted air for 82 percent of the days in a year, and water quality has improved to sound levels".
 China's new environmental targets have been welcomed by climate activists but have also prompted political fallout.
 Beijing accused the United States of "obstructing" the global fight against emissions last month, as tensions soar between the two over a number of topics including trade.

Voices from New York - Three writers take stock


--DocBreak--
Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Monday set a 2050 deadline for the world's third-largest economy to become carbon neutral, significantly firming up the country's climate change commitments.
 "We will bring the total amount of greenhouse gas (emitted by Japan) to net zero by 2050, meaning carbon neutral," Suga said in his first policy address to parliament since taking office.
 "I declare we will aim to realise a decarbonised society," he added, to applause from Diet members.
 Tokyo had previously only aimed to achieve carbon neutrality some time in the latter half of the century, a goal criticised by climate activists as vague and unambitious.
 The new goal puts Japan on the same timeline as Europe, Britain and a host of smaller nations, and a decade ahead of China, which last month set a 2060 goal.
 Suga did not give precise details on how Japan, a country still heavily reliant on coal, will achieve the goal but said technology would be essential.
 "The key is innovation," Suga said, citing examples including next-generation solar batteries.
 He said Japan would also push the use of renewable energy and nuclear power, stressing that safety would be a priority -- a key point in a country that suffered the Fukushima nuclear disaster.
 Japan, which is a signatory to the Paris agreement, was the sixth-biggest contributor to global greenhouse emissions in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.
 It has struggled to cut carbon emissions after shutting down nuclear reactors following the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima sparked by a devastating earthquake and tsunami.
 Reliance on fossil fuels like coal increased after the Fukushima disaster, as public anger over the accident pushed all of the country's nuclear reactors offline temporarily.
 \- 'The time is right' -
 Japan has regularly come under fire for continuing to build coal-fired plants at home, as well as financing projects to build them abroad, notably in Southeast Asia.
 The country's 140 coal-fired power plants provide nearly a third of its total electricity generation.
 The fuel is the second-biggest power-generation method behind LNG-fired plants, which provide 38 percent of the nation's needs.
 The new deadline is expected to shape the country's basic energy plan, which is currently being revised.
 The most recent plan, issued in 2018, aimed to have 22-24 percent of the country's energy needs met by renewable sources including wind and solar by 2030, a figure critics called unambitious based on current levels of around 17 percent.
 That plan also called for nuclear to provide more than 20 percent of the country's energy needs by 2030.
 Takaharu Niimi, a climate change specialist at the Japan Research Institute, told AFP that Suga's announcement was in line with an international move towards stronger commitments on the environment.
 In September, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter China announced it would be carbon neutral by 2060, a goal hailed by climate activists as a major step forward.
 "Considering the international trend, I think the time is right for Japan to declare the plan," Niimi told AFP.
 "I see this announcement as being part of the broad trend."

His first order of business after graduating from Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School in 2017 was joining the National Guard.
 John MacDermott delayed the start of college life and went to Missouri for basic training to fulfill one of his goals.
 "I've always wanted to serve,'' said the Bridgewater resident. "My cousin's been a role model to me, and he was in. My grandfather was in, too. I feel like it's something I had to do.''
 A couple of days after finishing basic training and military police school, MacDermott began his freshman year at Bridgewater State University in January 2018.
 He joined the Bears football team for the '18 season after playing four years at B-R and has been a two-year starter at linebacker in addition to earning the role of captain in 2020.
 And in addition to his studies and football, MacDermott is with the National Guard one weekend a month in Taunton. He has had several activations, and this year has been a busy time with COVID-19 and the protests to promote racial justice.
 It can be a balancing act, but MacDermott is happy that he made the decision to join the National Guard a few years ago.
 "As far as experiences I've had there, I wouldn't change it for the world,'' said MacDermott. "I think I definitely did the right thing. It helped me mature. It helped me grow as a person.
 "I wouldn't have had it any other way. I'm glad I went in early. I think it really matured me coming out of high school. I think it was the best thing for me.''
 MacDermott's fall semester isn't quite as hectic as normal since the BSU football team is playing no games this season due to the pandemic.
 Instead, the Bears are on the field three times a week doing some training to help in case they do play some games in April or to get a head start on the 2021 season, which would be MacDermott's final one.
 Since the end of the spring semester earlier this year, MacDermott has had plenty to do with the National Guard.
 He was sent to the Otis Air National Guard Base on Cape Cod in late April through late May to help with security at a field hospital that had been set up for COVID-19 patients.
 "It was awesome,'' said MacDermott. "It was real-world training. It doesn't get more real than that. I want to be a police officer, so it was great for that.''
 After finishing that assignment on May 31, MacDermott's National Guard unit was immediately sent to Boston where protests took place following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.
 "It was pretty quiet in the time that we were there,'' said MacDermott.
 The unit was there for each night for nearly two weeks, helping the Boston police keep the matter under control.
 "It's been pretty busy,'' said MacDermott. "My recruiter told me as far as activations, it would be hurricanes and stuff like that. I didn't see a pandemic and all the other stuff coming down the line.
 "But we got trained up to do whatever needs of the state, needs of the government. Whatever comes down the line, we're ready to go do that.''
 MacDermott found out in July that what was supposed to be his final BSU football season was called off due to the pandemic.
 He is expecting to return in the fall semester of 2021 in order to play one last year while finishing up requirements for a degree.
 "I think I'm going to give it one more season,'' MacDermott said. "We have a great group of guys and we've all been around each other since day one coming into college football. Those are some of my best friends. We've all kind of decided that we all have one more year left in us, one last hurrah to try to get a ring.
 "That first day of camp (next year) is going feel like Christmas being able to get back out there and get to a sense of normalcy. Reporting to camp hopefully next summer is going to be amazing. It's going to be something we've been waiting for for a year and a half.''
 MacDermott was an offensive guard at B-R and didn't switch to linebacker until joining the Bears program in 2018.
 He weighed 220 pounds as a high school sophomore and trimmed down to 185 pounds by senior year.
 "I wanted to go into National Guard and I lost a ton of weight my junior year because I knew that was something I wanted to do and I couldn't go in at 5-10, 220,'' he said. "I decided to cut down some weight.''
 MacDermott saw former B-R teammate Stefano D'Emilia while working out in the winter of 2018 and the wheels started turning for him to get back into football at BSU.
 "I saw Stevie D'Emilia at the gym over in East Bridgewater and he was the one who was like, 'Hey, we're down on linebackers. You look like you're in great shape. Why don't you come and try to play?' '' said MacDermott. "He set me up with coach (Joe Verria).
 "I've known coach V since me and his son (Ryan) played soccer together. I had a meeting with him and I was like, 'Obviously, I'm not a guard anymore. I'm 5-10, 185, where do you see me playing?' And he said, 'Why don't you try out for linebacker?' Honestly, I love it. I think it's the best spot to be on the field.''
 MacDermott moved into the starting lineup for the third game of the 2018 season and had 42 tackles and a fumble recovery in 11 games. Last season, he was in on 49 tackles with 3 1-2 for a loss of 16 yards and two forced fumbles.
 "It's been a good experience for him,'' said Verria of MacDermott playing linebacker. "He loves it. He's a smart kid, a very, very hard worker, extremely dedicated. He's done a great job for us. He's big and physical and he can run. He a great kid, a great leader and he loves football.''
 After playing one last season and graduating late next year, MacDermott has his sights on becoming a police officer, preferably with the state police.
 "From a very, very young age, I've wanted to do that,'' he said. "I always wanted to do something in public service. My dad's a firefighter. My uncle's a cop and my cousin's a cop. I always wanted to do something in that realm. I don't think there's a job that's more rewarding than that.''

_Depth_ is a sturdy, no-frills exercise. Rosen doesn't subvert the genre; he revels in it.

New York is no longer considered anything more than a satellite of America, but the fate of the entire country hinges on what's uncovered — or what remains buried — during the course of Simone's perilous investigation. Considering the setting, it would be easy to assume the book pontificates about climate change. Rosen isn't so obvious. Instead, he probes the uneasy relationship between coastal cosmopolitanism and backwater bigotry. He doesn't let New York off the hook, though, and his clear-eyed look at the sociopolitical dynamic of American culture transcends the deceptive simplicity of his nervy crime caper.

It became really important in World War II ... both American troops and British troops used it to combat malaria-carrying mosquitoes and typhus- carrying lice. And after the war it became commercialized in the U.S. and other places, and we went just gangbusters with it. We were really into it; we were using it on farmland and orchards, but also in the home quite a bit. There were all kinds of products: There were sprays; there were dusts. We could use it in the bedroom; there were wallpapers impregnated with it; there were varnishes that you could paint screen doors and drains with. It was all over the place. It just happened that it was very effective against bedbugs.

In honor of National Poetry Month, we invite our readers to join in on the discussion. What is it about poetry that causes so many readers and writers to view it as a superior art form? And, in light of Faulkner's assertion, what makes someone, especially one with such towering skill as a wordsmith, a "failed" poet?

You are 100% correct. People scream and scream and complain everything falls on deaf ears as far as the Board of Supervisors who are supposed to be the ones to hold her accountable. You try to ask the CEO for any information you just get a huge gigantic circular conversation that blame shifts off to everyone and 6 months later you wind up back at the point you started. It's ridiculous the games that they play and the lack of efficiency all of the money that gets awarded for Grants or new programs gets wasted and squandered down by the higher-ups before anything even happens. It's pretty gosh darn pathetic to watch this happening over and over again when smaller counties arerun much more efficiently and even larger counties run fantastically well and here we are in our swirling cesspool. No help from the higher-ups no help from the attorney general, grand jury reports fall on deaf ears. We should change the name of Mendocino County to Tarpit County. Because that's basically what happens everything gets stuck in the tar pits and that's it.
