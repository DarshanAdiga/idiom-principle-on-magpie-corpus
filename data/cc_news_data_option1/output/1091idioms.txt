“Literally, [my boss] told me to hide them,” said Allen, an X-ray technician at a Central Texas clinic who keeps the masks under lock and key. Many patients he sees get X-rays to check for pneumonia or other respiratory conditions.
 Allen was able to place a limited order for masks last week, he said, but a backlog of orders kept the manufacturer from fulfilling the complete request. He estimated his clinic had enough protective equipment to last roughly three months under normal conditions and said he had been told to reuse masks as long as the patients they came into contact with hadn’t tested positive for COVID-19.
 “I’ve heard from some of our members that they’re struggling just to get the disposable surgical gowns that they would use in the operating room and are having to resort back to cloth gowns that they would have to launder and sterilize,” said Serena Bumpus, director of practice for the Texas Nurses Association.
 In the eyes of Peter Hotez, the ability to protect health care workers from becoming sick is “our weakest link right now in our U.S. response to COVID-19.”
 Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN this week that keeping workers safe will be paramount in ensuring the health care system can handle an influx of sick patients.
 “If we have multiple front-line health care workers, ER physicians, nurses go down in this epidemic, a situation where we have colleagues taking care of colleagues in the intensive care unit, there’s nothing more destabilizing for the United States, and we have to make this our highest priority,” he said.
 Two emergency room doctors were reported to be in critical condition this week from coronavirus infection, one in New Jersey and the other in Washington. And on Monday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that one of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19.
 Texas reported its first coronavirus-related death, a Matagorda County man in his late 90s, late Monday.
 For Peterson, the Corpus Christi anesthesiologist, a main concern is the lack of testing, which can limit hospitals’ ability to perform effective triage, or sorting of patients based on how immediately they need care.
 One nurse at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston said the hospital had begun building a temporary structure in an ambulance bay to serve as a triage space. Brette Peyton, a hospital spokesperson, said it was one of "numerous proactive measures aimed at minimizing risk to our particularly vulnerable patient population."
 And Jacqueline, a nurse at Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, said her hospital was assigning some nurses to focus solely on patients who had tested positive for coronavirus.
 “In my years of experience in nursing, that’s absolutely unheard of because we just don’t have the staff for that,” she said. “I’m grateful, though, because that’s really what needs to be done.”
 Other nurses were being asked to prepare healthier patients to be discharged more quickly, she said, “because they don’t want them exposed to anything in the hospital and because we may need that bed.”
 A Parkland spokesperson did not respond to emailed questions.

A normal heart beat has two sounds typically described as "lub-dub" which are caused by heart valves closing. But sometimes when listening to a patient's heart with a stethoscope, a doctor may hear a heart murmur, a whooshing or swishing sound, during the cycle of a person's heart beat made by turbulent blood in or near one's heart.
   
 Sara Clagg, a family nurse practitioner at Novant Health Family Medicine Pine Forest, said a heart murmur may be present at birth or a person can develop murmurs later in life, and while it's not a disease or illness itself, some heart murmurs may indicate underlying heart problems.
   
 1) Two main types of heart murmurs -- innocent and abnormal
   
 A heart murmur is a sound that's made as the blood is pumped through the heart, and they are categorized as either innocent or abnormal. Often heart murmurs are innocent and harmless. These are not caused by structural heart abnormalities. They can be common in children. Overtime innocent murmurs may disappear on their own or once a condition causing it such as anemia or fever is treated. Sometimes they can last for a lifetime without causing further health problems. Clagg said children born with innocent heart murmurs can grow out of them.
   
 Abnormal heart murmurs indicate serious underlying heart problems, such as defective or damaged valves. Additional testing is usually needed to determine what's causing the murmur.
   
 2) Listening to the heart can help determine if a heart murmur is abnormal
   
 When listening to a patient's heart with a stethoscope, doctors can usually determine if a person has a heart murmur.
   
 "Abnormal murmurs have a different sound, and often alert us of things going wrong with the heart valves or the heart muscle," Clagg said. "When the doctor listens he will listen for things such as the character of the murmur he hears, whether it's loud or soft, the location of it--which heart valve is located where he's hearing the murmur, and what part of the heart beat cycle the murmur is in--is it when the heart is filling with blood or is it during when the heart is pumping blood, and those can all give clues as to which valve may be causing the problem."
   
 If a doctor believes a murmur needs further investigation, a referral to a cardiologist may be sent and various tests may be ordered such as an electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest x-ray.
   
 3) Pregnancy, exercise and various medical conditions can cause heart murmurs
   
 "Innocent murmurs can come and go and are caused by blood flowing more rapidly through the heart which can happen when you exercise, if you have extra blood volume with pregnancy, if you have fevers, anemia, or hyperthyroidism," Clagg said.
   
 Abnormal heart murmurs can be caused by structural heart problems, including congenital heart defects such as a hole in the heart's walls and abnormal blood flow between the heart's chambers or blood vessels and valve problems such as aortic stenosis, where the aortic valve is narrowed and doesn't open fully, restricting blood flow from the heart, and valve regurgitation, when a valve doesn't close properly, allowing blood to leak backward.
   
 "Abnormal heart murmurs are sometimes caused by infections, such as endocarditis, an infection in the inner lining of the heart, rheumatic fever caused by untreated strep(throat infection), and any kind of condition that might damage the structure of the heart" Clagg said. "Some medical conditions can cause heart murmurs over time, such as hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and pulmonary hypertension."
   
 Clagg said abnormal heart murmurs can also be caused by aging, heart damaged caused by uncontrolled diabetes, and structural damage to a baby's heart resulting from medications, drugs, or alcohol taken by the mother during pregnancy.
   
 4) Symptoms such as leg swelling, unexplained weight gain and shortness of breath
   
 Not everyone who has a heart murmur experiences symptoms. However, while symptoms aren't caused by the heart murmur itself, if there's an underlying structural heart problem, some may have accompanying symptoms.
   
 "Sometimes you'll have a blueish tinge to your lips and fingers, swelling in your legs, or unexplained weight gain, which is usually a sign of water- retention," Clagg said. "You can feel short of breath, develop a cough, have loss of appetite, chest pain, dizziness, fainting, and sometimes even a swollen liver will be noted in an exam…If they're having those types of symptoms, it's usually because of some structural problem going on in the heart, and a lot of times it's the valves that are causing the problem."
   
 5) Treatment for heart murmurs depends on cause
   
 If a heart murmur is caused by an underlying condition, doctors can determine a course of treatment.
   
 "Usually when doctors see your problem they'll try to take pressure from the heart using medication, and that can be things like diuretics which lower the blood pressure and prevents water retention and helps with the symptoms and blood pressure medications to lower the blood pressure and heart rate, such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers … ," Clagg said. "A lot of times they will put patients on anticoagulants, such as coumadin, aspirin, and Plavix to reduce the chance of blood clots going through the valves."
   
 Sometimes surgery is needed to repair or replace a valve and repair other heart defects.

She roped in as many members of High Society to help fund her project as she could and she got no less a personage than Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III to act as patron. For good measure she also later established a chapel adjacent to the asylum and managed to rope in George Viscount Townsend the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to attend the first divine service to be held there. As a result of such patronage many fashionable ladies were happy to attend and donate their purses to alleviate the plight of others.

But that isn't so easy right now. For Kirban's company and others, the sudden surge in demand has created upheaval in product manufacturers' typical courses of business and shocked supply chains in the process.
 Typically at this time of year, the Vita Coco warehouses are full of product in preparation for the busy spring and summer seasons. Now those stockpiles are quickly depleting. So, at a time when the company's manufacturers in Southeast Asia and Brazil would be winding down and operating at 60% to 70% capacity, they're running full tilt.
 "We still have a good 40 days' inventory on hand for all items," Kirban said. "It happened at a point in time that we're able to keep up."
 Vita Coco's supply chain remains intact, at least for now. The fully packaged beverages continue to arrive via ship -- a three-week boat trip from the Asian ports and a nine-day trip from Brazil -- and stored in warehouses in places such as California, Texas, Florida, Washington State and up the Eastern Seaboard. As long as the borders remain open for cargo, the supplies will continue to arrive, Kirban said.
 "There are no coconuts in the US," he said. "If we can't bring in coconut water, [Vita Coco is] in trouble."
 The company is preparing for the possibility of policies changing amid the uncertainty. On Monday, as local communities in the US hunkered down and took drastic measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, Kirban and his team drafted contingency plans if the lockdowns extended to state borders. If that happens, he said, "there are a lot of states in the middle of the country we just wouldn't be able to get product to."
 That potential scenario underscores the strangeness of this business boon for VIta Coco and Kirban.
 "We're dealing with these massive spikes in business," he said. "Yet the world is falling apart."

Nicolas Johnson, a Toronto-based gun-rights activist, said a blog post he wrote in July 2018 on how to buy a handgun legally has become his most-read in the past week.
 "In times of uncertainty, you focus on the basics like water, food and self- protection" Johnson said. "It's easy to imagine how things can deteriorate."
 The Liberal government, to the chagrin of the gun-rights lobby, has already taken steps to tighten laws. Its platform during last fall's election called for a ban on military-style assault weapons and allowing municipalities to ban handguns, among other restrictions.
 In Gormley, Ont., Target Sports Canada said possible shortages are on people's minds.
 "We're not quite at the toilet paper stage but people are buying a little more than normal," said Julie Howes, manager at Target Sports. "We don't have lineups or anything out the door."
 Some Canadian stores have opted to close in light of the virus, shifting to sales online.

“I understand the concern of some schools wanting the testing data to gauge how their students are doing. At the beginning of the year, we started the process of developing formative assessments. We have been monitoring our students on a regular basis this school year and will continue to collect that information once school resumes,” she said.
 Ward said he didn’t anticipate long-term effects on test lapsing for students in grades three through eight, but he was concerned about how the closures will affect End of Course tests high schoolers need to pass in order
 to graduate.
 “We still have seniors that were working hard and looking forward to taking the EOC in an attempt to gain a passing score to graduate with this year’s graduating class,” he said. “We are thinking of allowing our kids to test due to the effort they have put in preparing for it. More important, the data from those tests will prove invaluable to next year’s planning.”
 Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath in a Sunday call with school superintendents warned schools may be closed through the end of the academic year, though that’s a decision he said would be left up to local superintendents.
 “Texas is one of the largest public school systems in the world. Commissioner Morath is tasked with overseeing the 5.4 million children in Texas Public and Charter Schools. I agree with the commissioner that the best decisions are to be made at the local level,” Paris ISD Superintendent Paul Jones said.
 North Lamar ISD Superintendent Kelli Stewart said the information local school leaders are receiving is changing frequently, but “at the end of the day the safety and health of our students and staff is at the top of our priority list.”
 “In order for us to make the best decisions to continue to educate our students, North Lamar ISD is grateful for the flexibility Commissioner Morath has given to the school districts in the State of Texas,” she said.

GRAHAM - The Alamance County Board of Commissioners held an unusual called meeting at 11 a.m. Monday, March 16, for a closed door conversation with its outside counsel about the controversial permit for the Alamance Aggregates mine in Snow Camp.
   
 "The board had received legal advice from the county attorney and outside counsel concerning the permit issued to Alamance Aggregates, and the board has engaged the services of outside counsel to review the 2019 heavy industrial development ordinance to recommend improvements to that ordinance," Board Chair Amy Galey said after the roughly hour-and-10-minute closed session.
   
 Opponents of the mine, mostly Snow Camp residents living near the site and concerned about its impact, hired a lawyer who wrote to the county, saying the mine's permit was not valid and, unsatisfied with County Attorney Clyde Albright's dismissal of that argument, asked the commissioners to bring in an outside attorney to review it.
   
 The commissioners brought in Craig Justus, with the Van Winkle Law Firm in Asheville, who wrote them a 17-page report on the issue and "met" with them Monday by phone. The report and the conversation in closed session are exempted under attorney-client privilege from North Carolina open records and open meeting laws, so what advice Justus gave the commissioners, and whether the mine's permit is valid, is not clear.
   
 The controversy over the mine led the county to update its HIDO last year, increasing distances between some industrial sites and protected uses, like homes, churches and schools, but not necessarily preventing something like the quarry in Snow Camp.
   
 Later on Monday, County Manager Bryan Hagood responded to a Times-News email, writing "there are still a few steps before anything will be said about the permit issuance. As for the new HIDO, the idea is to have it reviewed to see if there are any specific parts of the new ordinance that could be made better. We don't know yet what those might be."
   
 The Planning Department approved a permit for Alamance Aggregates to open a crushed-stone operation on 321 acres in the area of Quackenbush, Clark and Snow Camp roads in early 2018. Neighbors brought it to the commissioners' attention about nine months later and formed the No Snow Camp Mine chapter of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League.
   
 Albright has been dismissive of their lawyer's conclusions and said the permit gives the mine owners a vested right, and the county could be sued if it interferes with that right. The mine opponents in Snow Camp have publicly criticized Albright for not taking their concerns and arguments seriously.

TORONTO - Transit agencies across Canada are adjusting their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic — in some cases by suspending fare collection altogether.
 Transit commissions in Halifax, Saint John, N.B., and Hamilton say they will stop collecting fares, while Montreal transit is operating on something of an honour system.
 The Societe de Transport de Montreal says fares aren't being validated on buses and people who don't use mobility aids should board at the back doors.
 But the Toronto Transit Commission is taking a different approach, saying fare inspectors will be on board but will no longer issue fines to fare evaders, instead educating them on the rules.

As analysts warn the country is entering a recession, the government is grappling with an enormous political undertaking with echoes of the financial crisis a decade ago.
 The House legislation would speed delivery of testing for the virus and provide paid sick leave to workers, but the focus in Washington has already moved to development of a larger response bill that would inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the faltering economy, provide relief to shuttered businesses, and help keep airlines from going under.
 At the Capitol on Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prepared his colleagues for unprecedented steps to deal with the epidemic’s body slam to the economy.
 “I will not adjourn the Senate until we pass a far bolder package,” McConnell said. “We aren’t leaving until we deliver.”
 But first, McConnell said, the Senate will vote on the House-passed package of sick pay, emergency food and free testing, putting it back on track for Trump’s signature — despite Republican objections over the potential impact on small businesses saddled with a new mandate to pay sick leave — subject to reimbursement from the government.
 “We’re going to vote to pass the House bill, but its imperfections will just make our more comprehensive package more urgent,” McConnell said.
 Overnight, the White House sent lawmakers a separate $46-billion emergency funding request to boost medical care for military service members and veterans, fund production of vaccines and medicines, build 13 quarantine centers at the southern border for migrants, make federal buildings safer, and reimburse Amtrak for $500 million in anticipated revenue losses, among other purposes.
 The Trump request also reverses cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and National Institutes of Health that Trump proposed in his February budget for next year and would create a $3-billion fund for unanticipated needs.

Returning to some semblance of normalcy is imperative for the Chinese and global economies.

As of March 18, China's economy was operating at 71.% of typical output, according to policy research firm Trivium. Factories are being inspected one-by-one before getting the green light to reopen, but the pace of revival will depend on the nature of business; services can recover much faster than manufacturing, for example, given the latter's reliance on knotty supply chains. High-tech and highly automated manufacturing also has a greater capacity to bounce back, being less labor-focused.
