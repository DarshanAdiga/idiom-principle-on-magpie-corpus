 LONDON, Sept 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Taking better care of nature could absorb many more climate-changing emissions - but will only work if big companies simultaneously slash their own emissions and focus on boosting biodiversity, not just planting trees, scientists warned.
 "It's vitally important to understand this potential can only be achieved with rapid and aggressive decarbonisation," said Nathalie Seddon, who directs the Nature-Based Solutions Initiative at Britain's University of Oxford.
 A broad range of companies, including some fossil fuel firms, are now promoting and adopting tree planting and other "nature-based solutions" as a smart and easy-to-grasp way to tackle the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.
 More than 560 companies, including giants such as tech titan Microsoft and retailer Walmart, on Monday urged governments to put in place stronger policies to protect nature and fight climate change, and guide business efforts toward those goals.
 Many of the companies, part of the Business for Nature coalition, said at New York Climate Week events that they were pressing ahead with their own green actions, from adopting clean energy to offsetting their carbon emissions by adding trees.
 But biodiversity and climate experts warned that in the corporate rush to cut emissions to net zero, too many nature projects are proving ineffective or even counter-productive.
 They called for tighter standards to ensure investment goes to what actually works.
 In particular, a surge of new tree-planting initiatives will be "hugely problematic" if it drives creation of commercial tree plantations rather than rejuvenation of natural forests, wetlands and other ecosystems, Seddon told an online event.
 "People like trees," the biodiversity scientist said. "You can physically plant them in the ground ... There's a romance around trees."
 But just establishing plantations "isn't a climate solution", she said, not least because the trees are often intended to be harvested and used, which can release the carbon they store.
 Worsening forest fires, pest plagues and simple neglect also can mean plantations do not last long enough to do the job promised, she and others said.
 Seddon called for green investments that focus on restoring land to "what was there before human interventions" and are done with the approval and guidance of local and indigenous people.
 The planet's forests and other ecosystems today absorb almost 30% of climate- changing emissions, with oceans taking in another 24% - levels that could grow if natural systems are restored and expanded, she added.
 'UP TO OUR EYEBALLS'
 Elizabeth Willmott, who leads Microsoft's efforts to become "carbon negative" by 2030 - eliminating more emissions than it produces - said the software giant was sorting through emissions removals proposals and finding the work complex.
 The company declared its intention to reduce or offset all of its emissions - dating back to its founding in 1975 - about nine months ago, and is now considering how to do that.
 "Due diligence on these projects is an enormous, enormous workload," Willmott said, including finding out if emissions cuts will be long-lasting and whether they can be verified.
 With more than 200 proposals in hand, some involving nature-based solutions, "we're up to our eyeballs in documentation", she said.
 Microsoft and other companies with climate targets would benefit from a system to provide a strong "seal of approval" for nature-based projects, and would likely ask standards bodies for that guidance, she added.
 Richard Black, of the UK-based nonprofit Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said more than half of the 30 biggest companies with net-zero emissions pledges were relying to some extent on nature-based solutions to meet them.
 Only a few have made clear how strong that reliance is, he noted. Seddon said judging how many were adhering to best practices and science was very difficult.
 Nigel Topping, Britain's high-level champion for the delayed COP26 climate summit, said pledges to boost nature "can't just be used as a sticking plaster over business as usual" and should follow - not replace - ambitious emissions cuts by companies.
 Failing to slash emissions would undermine both carbon offsetting efforts and the natural systems that act as planetary life support, Seddon warned.
 "We continue to erode biodiversity at our peril," she said. (Reporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering; editing by Megan Rowling. Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters. Visit http://news.trust.org/climate)

 ## HARVEST MOON
 Sometimes, when a place has been doing things so well for so long, there is a tendency to take it for granted. That may be the case for baby boomers and even the succeeding generation when it comes to Harvest Moon, but that has never been a major issue. Each generation that follows, it seems, finds its way to the Dawson Road eatery/watering hole that always seems to have the latest up-and-coming musical artists on its marquee.
 On this night, the fabulous Page Brothers Band were doing their thing, and while the band has become favorites all over south Georgia and north Florida, it’s definitely been adopted by a growing following in the Good Life City.
 With vocalist Dakota Page’s patented growl — a mix of Tony Joe White and Dr. John, with a dash of Otis Redding soul thrown in — in top form, guitarist/vocalist Travis Page offering up some of his hottest licks to date, and the rhythm section of bassist John Graham, who offered fine high-harmony vocal support, and drummer Paulie D each on the top of his game, the Page Brothers were, on this night, the epitome of music that’s best described as, just, “Southern.”
 The Page Brothers played some ZZ Top (“Jesus Just Left Chicago”), some B.B. King (“The Thrill Is Gone”), some originals (“Bloodhound” was a standout) and other favorites, showing newbie listeners why they’re one of the hottest bands in the region.
 With work — and a dozen or so other projects — looming, the evening out ended earlier than past such excursions. But, after six months of sheltering pretty much in place, this night out in Albany was enough to convince that, yes, there is the possibility of being entertained in the age of COVID-19.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (WBRC) - The Alabama Red Cross has more than 90 volunteers helping clean up after Hurricane Sally. More than half are on the ground in the coast and the rest are virtual, according to spokesperson Annette Rowland.Rowland said the focus is now on clean up and re-stocking fridges once the power became restored. She said crews are passing out hot and canned food along with cleaning supplies, like gloves and tarps.She said crews are also driving around and marking down highly damaged areas, so they can come back the next day with supplies. As for how long recovery efforts may take, she said it’s hard to say.“With anything like this," Rowland said. "Each community is different and each family is different. What could take Daphne a couple weeks could take Gulf Shores longer, so there really is no time frame. Each community is different, each family is different.”Rowland said they don’t know exactly how long they will stay on the coast.She said they plan be there as long as they are needed, which could potentially be weeks.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

In the meantime, there are various political attempts to convince governors across the country to legalize cannabis products either for medical or recreational use. Recently, a coalition of advocacy groups and cannabis businesses have introduced a new plan to legalize commerce across state lines regardless of federal prohibition. Adam Smith, founder and President of the Alliance for Sensible Markets, explained, according to the Marijuana Moment, that the proposed policy change, "immediately across producer states, you will see valuations for thousands of farms and businesses increased by multiples, which will spur an immediate wave of investment expansion and job creation. On the east coast in the consumer states, legalizing cannabis with interstate commerce, will mean that they can get industries up and running and stable in six-to-18 months, rather than three years or five years or seven years, spurring an immediate wave of investment, business formation and tens of thousands of jobs just when the states need them. We are looking to partner with the governors and be their partners in economic recovery."

It all started with a call to dispatchers in Summerville on Sept. 2, regarding a drug overdose. Police said when they arrived on scene they found a man being revived by EMS and a visiting maid, with numerous debit cards and an open line of communication with her incarcerated boyfriend.
 Police said they responded to a house on Aberdeen Circle in Scotts Mill. The person who called 911 was the eventual suspect in the debit card thefts, Angela Fleeman. A report from the Summerville Police Department states Fleeman told officers she works for a home cleaning business and while in between jobs her friend called her to pick him up for a ride home.
 Fleeman told officers she brought her friend along to the next job at the house in Scotts Mill. The report states while Fleeman was working she came down the steps and noticed her friend lying unresponsive on the bathroom floor and she then called for help.
 EMS was able to get the male stable and breathing and then took him to the hospital. Police said they found a syringe, uncapped, with brown liquid inside where he was lying. Officers began to question Fleeman, who was shaking and upset, about the drugs and she told them, she didn’t know where the narcotics came from.
 Police then asked Fleeman if they could search her car and she gave them permission. The report said the two officers on scene discovered nine debit cards in her car and none of them had Fleeman’s name on them.
 Police said when they inquired if she could provide any information regarding the names on the cards she told them a few of them belonged to her boyfriend and some others belonged to his friends. She told police they are all currently in prison. A couple of others, she said, belonged to her family members.
 The report states Fleeman went on to say her boyfriend is incarcerated at Lieber Correctional Institute and has been for the past eight years. Fleeman told officers she has messages stating she is allowed to use the cards. Police said they asked how she could possibly be messaging with an inmate, she told them, he has a cell phone and they frequently are reaching out to one another.
 Fleeman was then placed under arrest for financial transaction card theft. Police also took possession of her phone. The report states police later contacted an officer at the prison and gave him the names of the inmates Fleeman admitted communicating with.
 Fleeman was booked into the Dorchester County Detention Center. Information provided by the Dorchester County Sheriff’s Office shows she was later released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond.

After a few false starts, the Baylor Bears open their 2020 season on Saturday by hosting the Kansas Jayhawks in a Big 12 Conference contest in Waco, Texas.
 Baylor was originally set to open its revamped schedule on Sept. 12 against Louisiana Tech, but the game was canceled on Sept. 8 due to a Louisiana Tech COVID-19 outbreak. An impromptu matchup with Houston was added that same week, set for Sept. 19, to replace Houston's canceled game with Memphis.
 But Baylor was unable to meet the Big 12 threshold of available players, announcing another cancellation a day prior to the scheduled date. The conference requires its members to have at least 53 players total, with a minimum of one quarterback, seven offensive linemen and four interior defensive linemen.
 Max Olson of The Athletic reported Tuesday that Baylor lacked a sufficient offensive line depth chart due to contact tracing.
 "It was a hard Friday," said Baylor coach Dave Aranda on Monday. "It was a lot of emotion in that call. It left me with a great appreciation of our guys and just the character that they show continually."
 Aranda added that despite the disappointment, seeing the "character" was important in his ongoing feeling-out process as a first-year head coach. Aranda was hired to replace Matt Rhule, now with the NFL's Carolina Panthers.
 "Generally, you get to know your people playing games," Aranda said. "On the field, you can get a read of them and the type of character they have, and how they handle the good and the bad."
 Of those in McLane Stadium on Saturday, the one with whom Aranda has spent the most time on the field will be on the opposite sideline. Kansas head coach Les Miles hired Aranda as defensive coordinator at LSU in 2016.
 Miles was dismissed four games into that season, and Aranda remained for four seasons, culminating with last season's national championship.
 Kansas (0-1, 0-0 Big 12) hired Miles ahead of the 2019 season aiming to turn around a staggering run of misfortune. The Jayhawks have not finished over .500 since 2008, and last won more than three games in 2009.
 Year 2 of the Miles era opened inauspiciously with a 38-23 loss to Coastal Carolina on Sept. 12. The Jayhawks dug an early hole, falling behind 28-3 in the first half, and never recovered.
 "Offensively, we have to start fast," Miles said Monday. "It's pretty simple."
 Miles also pointed to Kansas' three turnovers, which Coastal Carolina converted into 21 points.
 Kansas used three quarterbacks in the loss: Miles Kendrick, who passed for two touchdowns, Thomas MacVittie and Jalon Daniels.
 "We'd like to move in the direction of one (quarterback), but we want to make sure that one is the best one," Miles said. "I don't think that's necessarily an easy decision."
 The Jayhawks seek immediate offensive improvements against a Baylor defense that last season ranked No. 19 in the country in points allowed, No. 7 in sacks and second in turnovers forced.
 While this Bears group features new faces playing for a new staff, Aranda's LSU defense was similarly outstanding with 37 sacks and 22 turnovers forced.
 Aranda said he anticipates Kansas will "test a 3-4 front with their run game." Jayhawks ball-carriers Velton Gardner and Pooka Williams combined for 148 yards on 23 carries and a touchdown in Week 1.

UCF has had plenty of success lately, and quarterback Dillon Gabriel is a large part of the winning formula.
 After a strong season-opening win at Georgia Tech, the sophomore signal-caller leads the No. 13 Knights (1-0) on the road again Saturday to Greenville, N.C., where the East Carolina Pirates will kick off their season with an American Athletic Conference clash.
 Gabriel passed for a career-high 417 yards and four touchdowns in last weekend's 49-21 road win over the Yellow Jackets, who had been riding the momentum of a season-opening upset at Florida State.
 "You saw what happened last week," chided Gabriel, whose previous best was 365 yards against ECU last year. "I guess you can say we're the best team in Florida."
 UCF has won 36 of 40 contests since 2017, and the last 13 games with Gabriel at the helm have been stout. Last year the left-handed Hawaiian threw for a freshman-record 3,653 yards as the Knights went 10-3 and 6-2 in the AAC.
 "From where he started a year ago, his comfort level and understanding how to play the game, when it's the right time ... He finished the season that way," UCF coach Josh Heupel said of Gabriel. "He started Week 1 further ahead than he ended last season."
 The Orlando team, which lost three road games by a total of seven points last year, had a pair of injuries at important positions Saturday as top wide receiver Tre Nixon and running back Greg McCrae were hurt.
 Replacing NFL receiver Gabriel Davis as the No. 1 wideout, Nixon was injured while hauling in his second TD pass, and senior rusher McCrae suffered a lower-leg injury.
 Heupel offered no update Monday on Nixon, but receivers Marlon Williams and Jaylon Robinson stepped up big in place of Nixon after Georgia Tech cut it to 28-21 early in the fourth quarter.
 Williams -- second with 51 receptions and third in receiving yards last year -- tallied a career-high in catches (10) and yards (154) and had two scores. Robinson, a transfer from Oklahoma, also set career marks with six catches and 105 yards.
 True freshman defensive end Josh Celiscar forced a fumble and pounced on it on his first career play, and later added an interception. Linemate Noah Hancock blocked a field goal.
 ECU struggled to a 4-8 mark overall (1-7 AAC) last season, and second-year coach Mike Houston will look to build upon a dynamic signal-caller in junior Holton Ahlers and an offense that sizzled at the end of 2019.
 Already with one 300-yard passing game -- Ahlers produced 313 at UCF in last year's 41-28 loss last October -- he dissected Cincinnati's potent defense in a 535-yard, four-TD performance in November's first game and passed for 498 yards and six scores in a 59-51 loss at SMU a week later.
 Ahlers completed 264 of 442 passes for 3,387 yards and 21 touchdowns. He connected on just 59.7 percent of his throws and had 10 interceptions but was also the second-leading rusher with 359 yards and six touchdowns.
 Houston said his group is anxious to get that first big win -- and beating the Knights would fit the bill.
 "You always remember that first signature win," said Houston, whose victories in 2019 were over Gardner-Webb, William &amp; Mary, Old Dominion and Connecticut. "That first big win that validates what you're doing. It'll come. I don't know when it's going to come. I'd love for it to be (Saturday)."

BRUSSELS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 23rd September, 2020) As the Russian government stands accused of poisoning opposition figure Alexey Navalny, politicians from various countries, including the United States, have proposed to suspend the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as a way of punishing Moscow for alleged transgression.
 The Nord Stream 2 project aims to lay a 745-mile-long twin pipeline that will carry up to 1.942 trillion cubic feet of gas per year from Russia to Germany, passing through the territorial waters or exclusive economic zones of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Russia, and Sweden.
 In late August, Navalny suffered a dire health situation and went into a coma during a domestic Russian flight. He is currently receiving treatment at the Charite clinic in Berlin. Germany claimed that the 44-year-old opposition activist had been intoxicated with a nerve agent of the Novichok group. As Navalny rose to notoriety through his criticism of the current Russian authorities, speculations of an alleged Kremlin involvement sprang up almost immediately.
 On Monday, US State Secretary Mike Pompeo told Germany's Bild newspaper that Washington was building a coalition to prevent the project from being completed, citing the Navalny situation as a possible motivation for Berlin, the pipeline's main supporter in Europe, to come on board.
 This is another step in the ongoing campaign by the United States to undermine the pipeline construction. Nevertheless, just like all previous attempts, the renewed charge by US President Donald Trump administration is likely to come out empty.
 In light of the Navalny incident, many German politicians spoke in favor of using the project's putative suspension as a cudgel to threaten. At the same time, some are not comfortable in bringing the pipeline into a separate matter. Thus, Germany's political world is in the process of making up its mind on how to proceed.
 "The unresolved issue of Navalny should not be used to jeopardize our security of supply. Both are processes to be considered separately from one another. So far, no evidence whatsoever has been provided that Moscow was behind the alleged poisoning of Navalny.

Yeah. And we didn't come back to pre-COVID looking -- we're looking and saying, there are certain jobs within our business that they were here that can work remotely, and they've been very successful working remotely. So we really challenged the team to say, what did we learn and what's the best practice coming out of COVID that we can take forward? And some of it is the remote workforce. The other is how we interact with the customers. I think like I've talked about, customers have changed the way we interact. You're going to have less face to face meetings going forward, right, for a while. And we've been able to really develop and adapt, because if you think about even our new Soleris equipment installs, a lot of those were doing remote.

Tusk V, Arkansas' live Russian boar mascot, will be relegated to taking laps in his carrier around the outside of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium on Saturday under COVID-19 protocols.
   
 Inside the venue where No. 3 Georgia opens its football season there be some 500 cardboard fan cutouts placed in the stands along with the approximately 17,000 real, live fans in a 76,000 seat stadium that will have reduced attendance.
   
 "I've been watching NFL games, and that Giants game, they had no fans there because of New York and their big corona breakout," Georgia outside linebacker Nolan Smith said. "We've just got to handle our business in front of us. Do what we do and bring our own juice."
   
 Georgia played its four true road games last season before an average of 68,878 fans
   
 Arkansas averaged 50,931 at home last year during a season in which it went 2-10 and fired Chad Morris.
   
 Georgia's next road game Oct. 17 will be at Alabama, which averaged 101,117, fifth most nationally and their other road games are at South Carolina (77,962), Kentucky (53,128) and Missouri (54,160). SEC schools are limiting attendance from 20 to 25 percent except for Vanderbilt which won't have fans through the end of October.
   
 Hunter Yurachek, entering his third season as Arkansas' athletic director, expects the Razorback fans in attendance will be "very enthusiastic and excited about the start of the season and excited about the fact that a team ranked in the top five from our conference that hasn't been here in over a decade is in Razorback Stadium."
   
 One measure of the temperature of the fan base after the hire of Sam Pittman as coach is that Arkansas had only a 35 percent opt out rate for season ticket holders. Students will account for about 1,600 tickets.
   
 Georgia athletic director Greg McGarity said he's not sure what the vibe may be for the Bulldogs but figures it will "be an eerie feeling for both sides."
   
 The video board and sound system will bring the noise -- including perhaps some booing, Razorbacks deputy athletic director Rick Thorpe told reporters last week--and about 150 Arkansas band members in the stands who will be miced up. Cheerleaders will be at the game, but also not permitted on the field.
   
 Things will certainly feel different before kickoff. There will no tailgating, Hog Walk and the players won't run through the A as they usually do.
   
 "We're going to do some things artificially to try to create an atmosphere for a home field advantage for our team that we all would normally enjoy in each of our SEC venues," Yurachek said.
   
 He hopes that "will give Sam Pittman and our team the best opportunity against Georgia."
   
 Georgia was allotted 500 tickets as the visiting team that is going to family members of players.
   
 Yurachek was impressed with the NFL's piped in crowd noise he heard on TV broadcasts in the opening weekend.
   
 SEC rules have said that amplified sound and the band can't be played once the center touches the ball.
   
 Athletic directors have had "robust debate," whether piped in crowd noise should be allowed to continue then like it would under normal attendance.
   
 "I am a proponent of the crowd noise being played past the time when the center has his hand on the ball because I think our student-athletes and our coaches, they're used to competing in an environment on the road that has a significant crowd noise," Yurachek said. "I think the crowd noise continuing I think is good for your TV audience and I think it just enhances your atmosphere in your stadium."
   
 Said Georgia associate athletic director Alan Thomas: "A lot of people are looking at, 'Hey, can we pump in crowd noise?' Since we have to put it through a sound system do we have to cut that when the center's hand touches the ball or will they allow us to continue that?"
   
 The ACC determined that home teams can blare music or artificial crowd noise but it can't be so loud that it "prohibits a team from hearing its signals once the offensive team breaks its huddle or, if no huddle, when the center addresses the ball," according to the Richmond Times Dispatch.
   
 Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly, whose team is playing in the ACC this season, said he was "blown away," by the atmosphere in South Bend against Duke in the Irish win Sept. 12 before a crowd of 10,097.
   
 "I was expecting it to be like, you know, an inner-squad scrimmage," he said. "That was a great environment. Our students created this, for our guys, and they said this to me, they or overjoyed in the sense that it felt like a football game."
   
 At Arkansas, fans had a chance to buy cutouts priced depending on seat location for $50 and $100, Yurachek said, with the more pricier one being the prime location including the front row around the stadium.
   
 Those will be signed at the end of the season by Pittman and sent to the fans.
   
 Arkansas also asked fans to submit videos to show on the board of them "Calling the Hogs."
   
 As for the hog, Tusk V, Yurachek said keeping him out of the stadium is prudent because of a risk he could contract COVID-19.

With no football in 2020, the onus will fall upon draft-eligible players to handle their pro football preparation.
 "I think they can still get prepared for the CFL but obviously nothing beats playing actual games," Allemang said. "I still think you're excited about the draft, there's some very good players going into it."
 The pandemic has created plenty of uncertainty. CFL officials remain unsure if there'll be an evaluation camp for '21 draft-eligible Canadian players.
 "Fingers crossed that's up and running and we're back to somewhat of a semblance of normalcy in the spring," Walters said. "There's a real question mark with the time some of these kids haven't been playing football.
 "It will be quite challenging without seeing them in person to gauge their fitness level, their health level, everything."
 U Sports is the lifeblood of Canadian content in CFL lineups. Franchises must carry 21 Canadians on their 46-man game-day roster and start at least seven.
 Walters feels clubs that have invested time recruiting Canadian universities and established relationships with coaches there will be better equipped to deal with the uncertainty. U Sports is important to Walters, who served as both the defensive co-ordinator and head coach of the Guelph Gryphons (2004-2009) before becoming Winnipeg's special-teams coach (2010-12).
 "When I was a Canadian university head coach it was a big deal when you had interactions with a CFL club rather than a week before the draft getting a random call asking, 'Who's good on your team?'" Walters said. "Out of respect for how hard these coaches and programs work, it's important to go support them and evaluate the players.
 "When you make your follow-up calls it's not a cold call asking about players. It's easier based upon the relationship you have and it's a conversation."
 Walters, Allemang and Mahoney all agree they're missing football right now.
 "I'm a big U Sports fan of all the sports and really miss getting out," Walters said. "I love driving to North Dakota to watch the Canadians play.
 "It's tough on all these guys to not be playing football."
 However, the pandemic has taught CFL officials how to make do with less and that more isn't necessarily better.
 "It's definitely different . . . but I've found you've kind of been able to be a little more efficient at times through this," Allemang said. "Our world changed a lot right in the thick of the ('20) draft process and we had to learn and try different things on the fly with video technologies that the rest of the world, the business world, were using.
 "You look at it as this is our situation and how can we make the most of it? And I think, for us, it feels like it's working pretty well so far."
 Walters agrees.
 "I think what this has shown is you don't need to be flying and meeting in person and spending money on trips and conventions to get stuff accomplished," he said. "From my point of view in regards to football, we can get a lot accomplished and save some money doing things the way we've operated during this crisis."

 Thus, at a time Turcotte and some of the club’s other top young players should have been returning to Southern California for rookie workouts and important development training, they’re heading across the Atlantic instead.

The big cups with pretzels are set to hit stores in November, and the mini cups with pretzels won't be available until January 2021.
 "Let's face it, we're all feeling a little bit salty this year," Ian Norton, Reese's senior director, said in a statement. "In true Reese's fashion, we channeled our feelings into sweet and salty deliciousness with new Reese's Big Cups with Pretzels."
 Reese's will also release Big Cups with Chips in March 2021, but those will only be available for a limited time. The Reese's with pretzels, however, are permanent additions to the candy brand's lineup.
 Hershey, like other confectioners, relies on impulse purchases to drive sales. But people are shopping less during the pandemic, making new and somewhat outrageous candy combinations more important than ever for junk food companies.
 That's why there are seemingly two dozen flavors of M&Ms in the candy aisle and a new variety of Lay's potato chips every month.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Vanessa Bryant, the widow of basketball star Kobe Bryant, has filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles County sheriff claiming deputies shared unauthorized photos of the crash that killed her husband, their 13-year-old daughter and seven others.After the Jan. 26 crash, reports surfaced that graphic photos of the victims were being shared. Vanessa Bryant was “shocked and devastated” by the reports, the lawsuit states.The suit seeks damages for negligence, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.“This lawsuit is about accountability and about preventing this disgraceful behavior from happening to other families in the future who have suffered loss,” Vanessa Bryant’s attorney, Luis Li, said in a statement. “The department formally refused Mrs. Bryant’s requests for information saying it was ‘unable to assist’ with any inquiry and had no legal obligation to do so. It’s now for a court to tell the department what its obligations are.”The victims died when the helicopter crashed into a hillside in Calabasas, northwest of Los Angeles, during cloudy weather. They were traveling to a youth basketball tournament at Bryant’s sports facility in Thousand Oaks. The National Transportation Safety Board has not concluded what caused the crash on the outskirts of Los Angeles County but said there was no sign of mechanical failure in the Sikorsky S-76. helicopter.Sheriff Alex Villanueva previously told news media that eight deputies took or shared graphic photos of the scene and he ordered the images deleted. The sheriff said the department has a policy against taking and sharing crime scene photos, but it does not apply to accident scenes.“That was my No. 1 priority, was to make sure those photos no longer exist,” Villanueva previously told&nbsp;NBC News. “We identified the deputies involved, they came to the station on their own and had admitted they had taken them and they had deleted them. And we’re content that those involved did that.”Vanessa Bryant’s lawsuit alleges the sheriff’s actions constituted a “cover-up” of the misconduct. The suit claims the photos could still exist.“Mrs. Bryant feels ill at the thought of strangers gawking at images of her deceased husband and child and she lives in fear that she or her children will one day confront horrific images of their loved ones online,” the lawsuit states.California Gov. Gavin Newsom has not yet signed a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for first responders to take unauthorized photos of deceased people at the scene of an accident or crime. The legislation was prompted by the crash photos.A statement from the sheriff’s department Tuesday incorrectly said such actions are now criminal. The bill has not yet been signed into law.“Shortly following this tragic crash, Sheriff Villanueva sponsored legislation which now makes it a crime for public safety personnel to take and share non-official pictures of this nature,” the statement said. “Due to the pending litigation, we are unable to offer further comment.”The&nbsp;Los Angeles Times&nbsp;first reported the allegations that the graphic photos had been taken and disseminated in February.Bryant previously filed a claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, in May. The suit was filed Thursday.Separately, Vanessa Bryant has also filed a lawsuit alleging the helicopter’s pilot, Ara Zobayan, was careless and negligent to fly in the fog and should have aborted the flight.The brother of the pilot has said in a court filing that Bryant knew the risks of helicopter flying and his survivors aren’t entitled to damages from the pilot’s estate, while the helicopter company, Island Express, says it is not responsible for damages, calling the crash, among other things, “an act of God” and “an unavoidable accident” that was beyond its control.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

SAVANNAH, Ga. (WTOC) -Voter registration jumped in both states by about 10 percent between the last presidential election and now. Chatham County alone saw a 35 percent increase, but that increase doesn’t always translate to voter turnout. In 2016, about three-fourths of Georgia’s registered voters headed to the polls. Chatham County Board of Registrars Chairman, Colin McRae, says we’re about on par with the number of registered voters compared to the last presidential election.“We expect to have a significant number of additional registrations between now and the cutoff date," says McRae. "The deadline for registering to vote for the November election is October 5th.”McRae says the latest count of registered voters is about 3,200 voters fewer than 2016. If you don’t know if you’re registered or not, you can check your status on the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page. Absentee ballot requests are also expected to skyrocket.“If you plan to vote by absentee get your absentee application in," McRae says. "Do all that on today, National Voter Registration Day, it would be a great day to celebrate it.”Absentee ballots were mailed out this past Saturday, and already, there have been around 33,500 people applying for those ballots. To help with the collection of those, the League of Women Voters raised money to buy eight more drop-off boxes to go around the County.“Just by happenstance, on today, National Voter Registration Day, we’ve received the eight physical boxes that will be used," he says. "So we anticipate getting those online pretty quickly.”McRae says if you plan to vote absentee, to give yourself four weeks before Election Day to do so.Copyright 2020 WTOC. All rights reserved.

One of my correspondents — a friend with whom I frequently disagree but deeply respect — said  the “…only thing I found objectionable at all was your use of the words suckers and loser;  No one knows what was actually said or not said; but when an article uses unnamed sources in such a derogatory manner about a sitting president in an election year as the Atlantic did, one would be foolish not to at least question its veracity, and candidly, its appropriateness.”
 This is certainly fair game. To question the veracity of anything unless you heard it with your own ears or saw it with your own eyes is the essence of critical analysis and I applaud my friend for so observing.
