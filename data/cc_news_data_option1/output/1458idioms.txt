“We moved here from the Chicago area in the Spring of 2013, thinking this would be a nice change of pace … about a month before the Black Forest Fire turned everything upside down around here,” says Tri-Lakes/Monument Fire Department Chief Chris Truty. “I was seeking a new life challenge, and got way more than I bargained for. So much for semi-retirement!”
 Chief Truty came to Colorado after 27 years in Mount Prospect, Ill., retiring as Deputy Fire Chief. “My wife Heidi and I are both Illinois natives, and we were ready for a change of scenery,” Chris said. “My parents relocated to Colorado Springs in 2000 and the kids were grown and doing their own thing (Jenna lives in the Springs, son Adam is in San Francisco and Hillary’s in Chicago), which made this make sense. It was a big change personally and professionally, coming from one of the country’s biggest metro areas to Monument, and there was some adjustment for both of us.”
 Chief Truty’s literal trial by fire in June 2013 was a big learning experience, even for someone with his decades of firefighting. “Dealing with an event like the one in Black Forest is vastly different from an urban fire, which I found out right away. In the Chicago area, you’re usually working to save a structure and assure people’s safety. Out here there’s just so much area to cover that it’s a whole different ballgame tactically. I was thrilled to see so many different departments, communities and even states coming together to fight this thing, along with the residents themselves.”
 Today’s public safety environment presents entirely new challenges, with both police and fire crews learning in the field, as it were. “While we adapt to the daily changes this crisis brings, I feel the need to keep the community up to speed on what we can be doing as individuals to stay safe … to be part of the solution against this virus and to not be misinformed. It’s another massive learning curve, but as always communication is a big part of the equation. It’s a two-way thing: we’re working make sure everybody has the latest information on this thing [Chief Truty’s updates may be found at tlmfire.org/covid19-blog], while encouraging people to let us know how we can help right now or what we can do to better serve the community.”

We can take this opportunity of pause to change/upgrade what normal life looks like.
 There are some lessons I want to carry over from this time of isolation. They include:
 KINDNESS — the increased amount of kindness among strangers and neighbors that I’ve encountered, and that I see in my own behavior. I wave to everyone on my twice-daily neighborhood walks with my dog, and from my “satellite” office on my porch. I greet every person I see — he or she may be my only human in- person encounter for the day. I appreciate the good mornings and hellos from strangers more than before.
 FAMILY TIME — I also notice families enjoying being together, seemingly more than before this pandemic. They are out for daily bike rides or playing in yards, writing inspirational messages on the sidewalk in chalk, chatting together on the front stoop.
 CONNECTION — I’ve reached out to friends and loved ones more often, often with video on Facetime or Zoom (something I was loathe to do before all this — God forbid anyone would see my messy hair). We celebrate birthdays, hold book clubs and play games together, from our separate screens. A group of friends recently did a video-chat painting party.
 COLLABORATION — While physically separated from others in my newsroom, I’m still innovating with my coworkers. We have a collective mission — to bring you the news, no matter what. We are, while working remotely, telling your stories and informing you of the latest news.
 BREATH — We are learning to manage our stresses and anxieties without the usual means. Gyms and yoga studios (and bars) are closed, so we turn to the outdoors. Working and studying from home bring their own challenges, so we learn to give ourselves space and time to adapt. Supplies are scarce, at times, so we learn to make do and get creative (conjuring masks from scarves, toilet paper from … napkins, tissues, whatever.)
 We can carry these lessons into our future. We can use them to help us get there.
 Belated Happy Easter and Happy Spring to you. We will get through this together, and apart.

“I used to be an EMT, so I’m very used to the idea of responding to an emergency,” he said on Monday. “You keep at it until you’re finished with your work, and we’re certainly not finished with our emergency response to COVID, but I do think we’re seeing some encouraging changes.”
 Bray said his committee and others in the Senate have worked on laws that address issues created by the pandemic and the government’s actions to mitigate the spread of the virus.
 Municipal governments are allowed to meet remotely during the crisis, and the Secretary of State has been given authority to alter election procedures for this year. Bray said right now the Senate is working on a measure regarding marriage licenses that would waive the requirement that they be signed in the presence of a town clerk.
 “I think we have a few more weeks of that kind of intense work, but I think eventually we’re all hoping that we will have an opportunity to turn to important legislation that’s now on the back burner,” Bray said.
 Among those back burner items are amendments to Act 250, Vermont’s major land use law, which prior to the pandemic had absorbed a great deal of the Legislature’s time and attention. The amendments were passed in the House and sent over to the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, where it’s been sitting.
 Bray said it’s easily among the top three bills the Senate would likely make a priority once it can divert attention from COVID-19. Even so, there might not be enough time to address it.
 “I’ll be frank, it’s a large and complicated area of work,” said Bray. “It has everything from municipal planning all the way through statewide planning and land use, it has economic development impacts, it has recreational impacts, it has environmental impacts, and so because it is really a complex group of vital laws I want to be extremely careful in how we take it up and what we move.”
 Given this is the second year of a biennium, any bill that doesn’t pass can’t be carried into the next session; it would have to be introduced again and go through the legislative process from the beginning. Bray said that can sometimes mean a bill is written again from scratch, or the last draft being looked at is submitted.
 Bray said Act 250 changes aren’t to be taken lightly.
 “A lot of how Vermont looks now has been shaped by how we’ve used Act 250 for the last half century, because it plays this fundamental role in who we are and how we grow and develop,” he said. “I think we have to work on it thoughtfully and carefully. My concern is, we may not have enough time, this session, to do that kind of work. I don’t know for a fact. If we do have more time, then I can see us making some progress.”
 House Rep. Charles “Butch” Shaw, R-Pittsford, said he and some House committees are working remotely, but they also had a hefty load in front of them even before the coronavirus complication.

Nevertheless, I was already little confident about the figures announced before the confinement – Mediapro envisages 3.5 million subscribers for a subscription at 25 euros per month. I still have doubts today about Mediapro’s strategy of buying rights at such a short cost for such a short period of four years. It took beIn Sport between seven and eight years to reach 3.5 million subscribers at the cost of many efforts. Mediapro will experience the first years of economic imbalance, it seems inevitable. This will only increase the figure to be reached in order to be viable in the long term … Perhaps they will be able to compensate for these losses by the partial resale of rights to other media players, that remains unclear. We were all delighted with this deal, but we all wondered about the arrangement that will follow…

“Because when you go down to the west of Ireland and into rural parts of it, it is remote. Your next door neighbour might be a kilometre or two down the road and so, as we said, the postman might be the only person they see from morning till evening.”
 One particular An Post initiative the two-time All-Star was delighted to see come on stream in recent weeks was the distribution to every household of two free postcards. Those cocooning appreciate far more a hand-written letter than a text or WhatsApp message.
 “What was a dying art was letter-writing. I have two teenagers myself who don’t know how to write a letter. I deliver to nursing homes and there is nothing but cards and letters at the moment. It is a throwback to 15 years ago when people were writing on a regular basis.
 “For grandparents, they see the handwriting and it is very touching for them, much more so than getting a text. It brings us back down to earth and it is nice to see it.”

Republic of Ireland defender John O'Shea would not be drawn on his international future after his side exited Euro 2016 following defeat to France.
 The 35-year-old started Ireland's opening two games at the tournament, but did not feature in the win over Italy and made only a late substitute appearance in Sunday's knockout loss.
 When asked about his potential retirement after the French reverse, O'Shea opted to focus on celebrating a strong campaign with his team-mates.

 "I'm going to enjoy tonight with a special group of players and a special backroom staff and coaching staff.

 As the number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 continue to grow in Michigan, transparency and accuracy in reporting is a must. I'm calling on the state of Michigan to share necessary information and more complete data relevant to the coronavirus in southeast Michigan and to the entire state. Sick patients are being forced to wait in parking lots at Beaumont Hospital. Their dedicated doctors and nurses are working tirelessly around the clock, so why are people waiting? They are waiting because the hospital is backlogged, and information about bed availability at nearby hospitals is unavailable.
 What is even more unsettling is that the data exists and is available to the state's Department of Health and Human Services, but it simply has not been disseminated to the hospitals that desperately need the information.
 Lack of information from the department isn't unique to medical professionals; it has been a major roadblock for me and other legislators as well - inhibiting the ability to make informed decisions that could help tackle the coronavirus issue in our state and understand where and what resources are most needed.
 Recently, two of my House colleagues sent a letter to Michigan Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh S. Khaldun requesting more information relevant to the state of coronavirus in Michigan. The letter urged the governor's administration to work with the Legislature and release further and more detailed information related to coronavirus in the state. The letter requests the following information:
 ‒ Bed capacity and availability numbers by hospital
 ‒ Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 by hospital
 ‒ Average length of stay for COVID-19-patients in hospitals
 ‒ Aggregate data on the age and health conditions of patients prior to contracting COVID-19
 ‒ Number of medical ventilators by hospital
 ‒ General information related to personal protective equipment supplies by hospital
 I echo the concerns brought forward by this letter and urge the administration to work with the health care professionals and the Legislature. Data collection and dissemination is integral to crisis response. Without necessary information, it is impossible to make informed decisions for the greater good of patients, families, workers and businesses across the state.
 On the front end of Michigan's COVID-19 action, I supported an emergency budget action plan to address evolving challenges with the spread of the virus. This plan provides $50 million for immediate needs such as virus monitoring and testing, $50 million for critical health care providers to expand capacity for coronavirus response, and $50 million to keep in reserve for when necessary.
 As confirmed COVID-19 cases in Michigan have surpassed 20,000 and with the number of deaths approaching 1,000, so grows the strain on resources and health care providers. I believe there is more the state can do to help, but until more data is made available, the ability to make informed decisions is severely limited. All branches of government must work together to be proactive and protect the people of Michigan from the effects of the virus. I am confident that if we work together, we can save lives and end this pandemic.

But a tournament like Roland-Garros turns out to be problematic. The money generated by this major event of French and international tennis weighs for 80% of the revenues of the French Tennis Federation. It is therefore this only tournament which makes it possible to finance leagues, clubs and technical managers. If it is canceled, the federal pyramid of French tennis collapses. And you have to move it to a time when you are sure it will be broadcast. Without dissemination, no sponsor. Conversely, Wimbledon has completely canceled its 2020 edition. But there is a big difference, it is a private tournament, organized by a club. If they have an agreement with the English tennis federation, the stakes are lower for the vitality of British tennis.

“When we adjourned on the 13th of March, we were going to be gone for a couple of weeks and hopefully back,” he said. “That hasn’t panned out, so now we’re looking down the road, and we’re really not sure when we’re going to go back, depending on how things are going with COVID-19.”
 Shaw is vice chairman of the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions. It’s been meeting remotely, he said, and has finalized the bill that deals with the maintenance, repair and construction of state buildings. Shaw said the committee hasn’t voted to send it to the House floor yet, in case it needs to be used as a vehicle for some COVID-19 related sending measure.
 Also, his committee is working on S.338, a bill that Shaw said would be a major change to how the state handles people who are incarcerated.
 “That’s a pretty heavy lift to be doing on Zoom,” said Shaw, pointing to the online teleconferencing system. “Fortunately, the committee had looked at the bill before we left the building and had a general understanding of where it was going.”
 The bill essentially would see probation and parole used more often than the furlough program. Shaw said people who’ve been incarcerated do better when out on probation and parole than they do under furlough. The bill establishes new rules around these programs and has greater input from victims.
 “I don’t know if we’re going to pass it out anytime soon. My thought to that is no, because we want to make sure we get this one right,” Shaw said.
 Sen. Cheryl Hooker, D/P-Rutland, said while everything the Senate is doing right now is related to COVID-19, that could include a lot of things given the pandemic and the response touches nearly every aspect of people’s lives.
 Hooker said she and others are working on getting some kind of hazard pay to people who continue to work in areas putting them at risk to the virus. The goal is to make those people’s pay more equitable with what the federal government has allotted to boost unemployment insurance for those unable to work or lost their jobs altogether.
 “Things are being delayed, and the hope is if we continue to meet this way, remotely, that we will take up some of the bills that went through,” said Hooker. “I had sponsored a bill on insulin caps for people that have diabetes, I’m hoping that doesn’t fall by the wayside.”
 Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, said there are a lot of little things he was looking forward to seeing get passed this session, but might have to be rebooted later.
 “Which is understandable, first of all, but it’s discouraging when you work on stuff and you look forward to seeing the results of the work but not being able to move forward,” he said.
 Perchlik said there were bills related to climate change and transportation that had strong support in the House that he had hoped to see advance, as well as bills pertaining to education.

I'm calling on the state of Michigan to share necessary information and more complete data relevant to the coronavirus in southeast Michigan and to the entire state. Sick patients are being forced to wait in parking lots at Beaumont Hospital. Their dedicated doctors and nurses are working tirelessly around the clock, so why are people waiting? They are waiting because the hospital is backlogged, and information about bed availability at nearby hospitals is unavailable.

Monaco should get out of it. Even though they have made several recruiting mistakes lately, they have amassed a significant war treasure of several hundred million euros over the past five years. Lille had a great season last year, allowing them to access the Champions League (LDC), but above all to save themselves before the DNCG (the National Directorate of Management Control, which controls the clubs’ balance sheets each year. allow them to register for competitions). In this context, the club does not have much margin, but the outcome of this season could guarantee them a reprieve, if they accede to the LDC again. Lille must therefore generate cash to avoid being in the alert zone. Luckily for them, the sporting dynamic of the club, when the championship stopped, was there – before the suspension of the Ligue 1 championship, the club was in fourth place, one point from the podium.

Ricardo Quaresma was Portugal's hero for the second game running as he capitalised on Jakub Blaszczykowski's missed spot-kick to seal a 5-3 penalty shootout win over Poland in the Euro 2016 quarter-finals.
 Substitute Quaresma scored the only goal as Portugal, who have reached the semi-finals without winning a game in 90 minutes, defeated Croatia in the last 16.
 And the winger rifled his spot-kick high into the goal after Rui Patricio had got down low to his left to push aside Blaszczykowski's effort at the Stade Velodrome as the match had finished 1-1 following extra time in Marseille.
 It could easily have been a different story for Poland - who had beaten Switzerland on penalties in the last round - as Robert Lewandowski, much maligned for a series of poor performances throughout the tournament, netted the second-quickest goal in Euros history to end a 645-minute wait for a European Championship goal.
 Portugal levelled just after the half-hour, though, as Renato Sanches - man of the match off the bench versus Croatia - marked his first international start by becoming the youngest scorer in a Euros knockout match.
 And Portugal were left celebrating after the shootout, the miss particularly harsh on Blaszczykowski, who scored twice earlier in the competition and has been so influential in Poland's best showing at a European Championship.
 Wales or Belgium now await Portugal in the last four.
 Both teams played 120 minutes in their last-16 ties, but Poland showed no signs of weariness early on and stormed ahead after 100 seconds.
 Cedric misjudged a looping pass and Kamil Grosicki raced down the left before centring for Lewandowski, who clinically side-footed into the left corner from 10 yards.
 Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani were largely isolated by Poland's stern defence early on, but the momentum slowly shifted Portugal's way, the former flashing a shot at Lukasz Fabianski from the edge of the box before seeing penalty claims waved away after being bundled to the ground by Michal Pazdan.
 And the leveller came in the 33rd minute. Nani's clever flick set up Sanches and his 25-yard left-foot effort took a slight deflection before nestling in the right of the goal past a despairing Fabianski.
 There was little to split the teams at the start of the second half, but Ronaldo will feel he should have done better after being slipped in on the left of the area and shooting straight into the side-netting.
 Ronaldo then fluffed his lines from eight yards with an air shot after finding space to meet Nani's low ball, before Cedric flashed a 25-yard effort past the left-hand post.
 Portugal almost got lucky when Artur Jedrzejczyk's attempted clearance came close to finding Fabianski's bottom left corner, while the luckless Ronaldo failed to make contact with Joao Moutinho's sublime ball over the top.
 Neither team was able to make the breakthrough in regulation time, though, and there were few talking points in a drab extra time - the match pausing briefly due to an ill-advised pitch invader.
 That meant penalties were required to settle the affair with Ronaldo and Lewandowski setting the tone for a fine shootout with excellent penalties.
 But it was Blaszczykowski that felt the spot-kick pain with the eighth effort, Patricio pushing away strongly with a big left hand to set the stage for Quaresma to emphatically hammer home the winner.

In the past, it seemed like there was never time for special moments like these. Now there’s all the time in the world.
 These are hard times to be sure. But I have to believe this horrible disease is bringing out the best in us. I think of watching neighbors bring each other groceries. I think of the thousands of people who have given their time and money to help others. I think of health care workers who are laboring incredible hours to save the lives of strangers.
 Walking a little farther, I turn the corner to see a woman sitting on her porch, playing a mandolin. A father stops pushing his stroller and stands to listen. The woman smiles. “This is dancing music!” she calls out, over the Celtic tune. And right there, father and child start a two-person dance party on a stranger’s front lawn.
 Would this have happened before COVID-19? I don’t know. But I guess I like to believe that this disease that has taken so much from us — and will take so much more — might also help us see how lucky we truly all are.
 It may look a little gray at times, but this is still a wonderful world.

In an effort to highlight the complexity of the problem, Pandolfo walked board members through a couple of scenarios that could stem from a strict adherence to room assignments based on gender at birth.
 “I understand this isn’t the most comfortable conversation for everyone,” he said. “I understand that everybody ... may have somewhat different perspectives on this. I’m just telling you the realities of what we deal with on a daily basis.”
 Pandolfo said offering to accommodate students who might have a gender-based objection to their room assignment under the current practice is an imperfect solution.
 “The only option is you get singled out,” he said.
 Spaulding Principal Brenda Waterhouse said students can’t be required to declare their sexuality – adding yet another wrinkle to the mix.
 According to Waterhouse, a draft proposal is in the works, with advice from various groups, including outside professionals.
 “Things are changing so rapidly from our perspective and not rapidly enough from the students’ perspectives,” she said.
 Pandolfo offered a similar assessment, noting he wanted board members to start thinking about the issue before it lands in their laps.
 “I think we have groups of students … who might … be prepared to weigh in on it sooner than you would think because they feel strongly about it,” he said.
 While settling on a solution might be complicated, Pandolfo said understanding the need for one is not.
 “It presents problems when students choose not to go on field trips and lose opportunities because they aren’t comfortable,” he said.

Chelsea winger Pedro insists he has no regrets over moving to Stamford Bridge, though he admits he does miss Barcelona.
 The Spain international was signed by Jose Mourinho in August last year and made an explosive start to life in the Premier League, scoring on his debut in a 3-2 win over West Brom.
 The 28-year-old endured a largely inconsistent campaign, however, hitting seven league goals in 29 games as Chelsea - having replaced Mourinho with Guus Hiddink following a dreadful first half of the season - missed out on Europe and failed to win a trophy.
 Pedro admits he misses life at boyhood club Barca and concedes the past season has been a tough one, but he maintains he made the right decision to join Chelsea.
 "It's been a very strange year, for everyone," he told Mundo Deportivo.
 "It was a very difficult situation. Imagine it - you arrive and it seems like everything's going well, I got a goal on my debut, but then you start on a very negative dynamic. We put ourselves on a decline and then a lot of things changed from there.
 "They sack the boss, a new one comes in, there is a lot of uncertainty. The players didn't really know what to do, we all came together in the dressing room and we tried to pull together to go forward. In the end, we were able to shift the situation a little but we didn't get back to where we wanted to be, where we should be.
 "Of course I miss Barca. I had many years there, I felt very loved on the street. I've had the best moments of my career there and I really miss it. But I do not regret going [to Chelsea]. I'm very comfortable, it's a great club.
 "It's been hard because a change is always tough for a player at the start. You start from scratch, in a new league, new team, new language, new culture. But my team-mates helped me a lot. We look forward to doing something big."
 Pedro was called up for Spain's Euro 2016 campaign despite his mixed form for Chelsea, and he is now desperate to fire the country to a historic third successive win in the competition.
 "It means a lot to me," he said of his call-up from Vicente del Bosque. "It means the coach still has faith in me. After having a bad year, to come to the national team, you take a break, you focus on this tournament and on doing things well.
 "The atmosphere is good, the squad is united. I'm raring to go."

In this regard, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Marten Dempsey likes to talk about radical inclusion. Similarly, Jean Monnet looked for common ground and social inclusion between the French and German people. In his strategic vision, French and German businessmen would work together and build a European Coal and Steel Community. Common bonds among businessmen would spread to the rest of the French and German populations and help turn longstanding enemies into friends. Did Monnet appear naïve and hopelessly idealistic? Possibly. But appearances can be deceiving. Monnet showed that a web of economic interdependence and social inclusion could lead to shared prosperity and a more durable peace than more short-sighted economic coercion. (Keohane, R. and Nye, J. 1989) In other words, shared prosperity would reduce the demand for violence and thus lower mutual threat perceptions – not a bad way to keep the peace in Europe for 70 years. If so, the time has come to abandon U.S. economic warfare and apply Jean Monnet’s strategy of shared prosperity to U.S.-Russian economic relations.

“The post was nearly gone,” recalls Fallon, who has been shoving envelopes through letterboxes for close on 30 years.
 “A lot of your standard bills had gone online so the union was trying to come up with different ways of keeping connected with rural Ireland.
 “Checking in on elderly folk to see were they okay and bringing them food and medicine were among the recommendations.
 “It is amazing how we have gone the full 360 and all these ideas are now in motion,” says the two-time All-Ireland football medal-winner.
 Of course, postal workers would have much preferred if these changes came about in very different — and far less worrying — circumstances. But like everyone else on the frontline, the men and women driving those familiar green vans — or cycling their bike in Fallon’s case — have adapted to these trying times, have done what has been asked of them, and then some.
