Israel's Ministry of Heath on Wednesday approved the Premier and National League teams to return to group training, the league administration announced. According to the statement released, "the professional soccer teams can return to hold contact-less training, with the pitch divided into two halves and in each of the halves the teams can train with 10 players, including the use of a ball, but without contact between the players."
 Since mid-March all soccer activities had been suspended due to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and, even for a couple of weeks prior to that, teams had been playing in empty stadiums with no fans.
 Israel Professional Football Leagues chairman Erez Kalfon said: "I welcome the decision of the Ministry of Health to return to group training, first in a reduced format, which is the first stage in the return of the professional soccer teams to activity and eventually real games. I am encouraged by the decision made at this time, with our goal now being to resume training without any restriction in early May, which will prepare teams for resuming their respective professional leagues.
 "I have said all along and I still declare that we will do our utmost to resume the games and end the football season on the field, with sportsmanship and not in any other way, as much as possible while conforming to the Ministry of Health guidelines," added Kalfon. "Beyond the tremendous sporting importance of ending the season on the pitch, the moral debt to the large fan bases and creating a cultural alternative for watching games, it is important to recognize that the soccer industry is a growth and employment engine for thousands of families in Israel whose income has been stopped and in need of unemployment money and other benefits from the government.
 Kalfon made sure to emphasize that it is not just the teams and players that will benefit.
 "In addition to the hundreds of professional players and teams in the team, there are hundreds of other families making a living from the soccer industry, ranging from photographers, production personnel, technicians, hair and make- up crews, team administrators, stadium workers, gardeners, concession personnel, food suppliers, clothing suppliers, security companies and more."
 While the theme of Kalfon's announcement was joyous, he also stressed the need for safety amid the still rampant pandemic.
 "I urge the players and teams taking part in training, please heed the Ministry of Health's safety instructions on the field and even more so off the field and avoid contacting other people beyond the team and your nuclear family to avoid possible contagion. The responsibility on your shoulders when it comes to resuming games is great and everyone has to behave in a mature and responsible fashion."
 Notwithstanding Wednesday's news, there is still no indication of when actual soccer games may resume, and even when they do the extreme likelihood is that they will take place without fans in the stands for the foreseeable future, possibly even until a COVID-19 vaccine is found and widely distributed.

In the meantime, all the attention remains on the COVID-19 amidst countries extending their lockdown periods, speculation of a global recession and further deterioration of fundamentals. On the supportive side of the buck, its status of "global reserve currency" and store of value underpins its safe haven preference.

BERLÍN, Alemania (EFE).- Las restricciones que rigen en Alemania en la lucha contra la pandemia son menores que en la mayoria de los otros paises -una excepcion es Suecia- y una de las libertades que existe es la de salir a correr, lo que ha sido ampliamente aprovechado como se puede comprobar en cualquier parque.  La gente tiene ahora mas tiempo libre, ademas los gimnasios estan cerrados. Tengo la impresion de que ahora hay mas gente que corre, dijo el vicepresidente del la Federacion Alemana de Atletismo (DLV), Mathias Reick en declaraciones publicadas por el diario Frankfurter Allgemeine.  Alemania va a estar mas en forma despues de la crisis. Nunca habia visto a tanta gente corriendo, aseguro, por su parte, el fondista Oliver Stoll en declaraciones al programa de television Sportschau.  La gente corre, de momento, sin objetivos precisos ya que las competiciones populares estan todas canceladas. Es posible que haya mucha gente que hasta ahora, en medio de la pandemia, haya decidido empezar a correr.  La acumulacion que hay en los parques y en las riveras de los rios a determinadas horas del dia hace muy dificil seguir la recomendacion basica de mantener una distancia de entre 1.5 y 2.0 metros ante otras personas.  Para ello, muchos recurren a rodeos aparatosos, se desvian de los caminos a los prados o hacen subitos cambios de ritmo segun las necesidades del momento.  Se calcula que en Alemania hay entre 17 y 18 millones de atletas aficionados que no solo se entrenan cada semana, sino que en tiempos normales corren a lo largo del año algunas competiciones que van desde relevos de 5x5 kilometros, una modalidad bastante popular, hasta el maraton, pasando por distancias intermedias.  La pandemia se ha llevado por delante las competiciones -la mas popular de todas, el maraton de Berlin que debia correrse el 27 de septiembre ya ha sido cancelada- pero la gente sigue corriendo.  La edicion alemana de la revista Runners World ha hecho una separata especial sobre la pandemia y en ella se incluye un articulo titulado Correr en tiempos del coronavirus.  La primera recomendacion es correr solo o con un compañero o compañera de entrenamiento con quien se viva bajo el mismo techo.  Lo segundo, mas dificil, es buscar trayectos alternativos a los populares y donde no haya suficiente espacio. Un bosque, en ese sentido, es mejor que un parque en la mitad de una ciudad.  La revista, por otra parte, insiste en que, incluso en tiempos de la pandemia, correr es una actividad saludable.  Quien corre, dice el articulo, no solo entrena el sistema cardiaco y respiratorio sino ademas fortalece el sistema inmunologico.  Pese a ello, es necesario no exagerar. Aquel que se pasa con la intensidad o con la extension de los entrenamientos puede verse confrontado con efectos negativos, no solo desde el punto de vista ortopedico sino tambien en lo relativo al sistema inmunologico.  Al margen de las razones organicas que hacen recomendable correr hay razones psicologicas que acaso sean incluso mas importantes. Correr puede dar una sensacion de libertad, importante en tiempos de encierro absoluto o relativo, las ideas se hacen mas ligeras y empiezan a dar vueltas por la cabeza, la imaginacion se delata.  Una ronda en un parque puede ser el mejor momento de la semana para despejar la cabeza, aclarar ideas o sencillamente olvidarse de las malas noticias, escribio el atleta Carsten Eich en la web laufen.de  Queda faltando, sin embargo, la falta de un objetivo a corto o mediano plazo. El salir a correr tiene, de momento, que ser algo que justifique por si solo.  Incluso el virologo Christian Drosten, uno de los mas consultados en Alemania a proposito de la evolucion de la pandemia, suele referirse en su videocolumna en la Television del Norte de Alemania (NDR) a las rondas que corre actualmente en los parques de Berlin.  Es imposible que no este bien hacer lo mismo que hace Drosten. decia un articulo reciente del semanario Die Zeit.

 Once those limits are reached, drivers should pass up other customers and the digital signs on the front of buses will read “Coach Full, Sorry.” At all other times, bus signs should read, “Essential trips only,” the bulletin said.

Without financial assistance, many restaurants won't make it until the shutdown orders are lifted and they're able to bring in customers again; 2 percent of the survey's respondents have already closed permanently, another 12 percent say they will close for good if the stay-at-home order extends to mid-May, and 23 percent say they'll be forced to close if the order extends until the end of May.
 The restaurant and bar closures were originally scheduled to be lifted on April 30 in Colorado and May 11 in Denver, but during an April 20 press conference, Mayor Michael Hancock stated that "the order will be extended; you can bet on that." Both Hancock and Governor Jared Polis have indicated that restaurant and bar reopenings will happen slowly and at reduced capacity, putting even more strain on the industry.
 So once bars and restaurants eventually reopen, you may find yourself dining next to a taped-off table or in a dining room with half as many chairs as it had before.
 Denver's restaurant landscape will definitely look different than it did before the pandemic, when the industry was riding a wave of record sales and popularity. Some of our favorites, such as Euclid Hall and the Market, have already closed for good, and many more are sure to follow.

Oil tank train cars sit idle Tuesday, April 21, 2020, in East Chicago, Ind. The world is awash in oil, there's little demand for it and we're running out of places to put it. That in a nutshell explains this week's strange and unprecedented action in the market for crude oil futures contracts, where traders essentially offered to pay someone else to deal with the oil they were due to have delivered next month.

Minnich, Wilbert P. "Bill" Age 87. Veteran U.S. Army Korean War. Purple Heart Recipient. Lifetime member of Bremen VFW Post 2791 Tinley Park. Usher with St. George Church Tinley Park for over 10 years. Beloved husband of Bridget "Patsy" Minnich (nee Galvin) for 63 years. Loving father of Joe (Maureen), Kathy (Neil Meyer) Minnich-Meyer, Steve (Barb) and Bill (Linda) Minnich. Cherished grandfather of 15 and great-grandfather of 10. Devoted son of the late Wilbert Minnich and Josephine (Tom) Tucker. Dear brother of David, Marshall, the late Tom Tucker and the late Ethel (Frank) Atkins. Bill was a friend to anyone who crossed his path. A man who never shied away from lending a helping hand to those in need. A role model to his kids, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Always a happy smile and a quick joke or sarcastic comment with his infectious laugh, sometimes at the expense of whomever was lucky enough to be with him at the moment. Bill was meticulous with his closet/drawer organizational skills, and insisted on ironing every item of clothing, right down to his famously ironed blue jeans with their crisp center crease. Loved his daily routine of buying his lotto ticket, then stopping into his favorite jaunt Teehan's Pub "The Library"; most days their first customer and always one, sometimes two beers being his limit, with a smile, a story and then back to his beloved wife Patsy. His Teehan's friends referred to Bill as "Korean War/Purple Heart Bill" and his seat at the bar is empty but his presence there and everywhere always remembered fondly. In light of the current health situation, the services for Bill will take place all in one day as a private service. He will be laid to rest along with the brave men and woman who gave their lives for our great nation at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery. The Minnich family would like to thank you for understanding and greatly appreciate your prayers and gestures of sympathy during this difficult time. Most importantly they wish for you and your loved ones to be safe. In lieu of flowers, donations to your local food pantry would be appreciated.

Worldwide, the coronavirus outbreak has infected millions and killed about 180,000, including more than 45,000 in the U.S., according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University from official government figures. South Dakota has reported 1,858 confirmed cases and nine deaths, though the number of infections is likely higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. The county where the racetracks are located has confirmed seven cases.

Those specs match up well with other similarly priced phones, and it also comes with wireless charging and an expandable storage slot. However, you won’t find a couple of things you’d expect. For one, while Motorola claims the Edge+ has a “water-repellant design,” the phone doesn’t have an official IP rating, so you probably won’t want to take it swimming. Also, its wired charging tops off at 15W, slower than most other phones. You can, however, use it to charge other phones or earbuds with reverse wireless charging.
 To take advantage of its dramatic curves, Motorola has a new software feature called Edge Touch, similar to Samsung’s own Edge screen settings. When on a table, the sides of the phone will light up to show charging status, incoming calls, alarms, and notifications, while you can swipe on the edge to bring up the notification panel or switch apps.
 In addition to a camera that rivals the S20 Ultra on paper, the Edge+ also can record in 6K and lets you pull 20MP pictures from videos. It also comes equipped with Quad Pixel technology with four times the light sensitivity “to capture incredibly clear and crisp photos in all lighting conditions.”
 The Motorola Edge+ will be available exclusively at Verizon on May 14 for $1,000.

WESLACO - A worker is recovering in the hospital after being rescued at 130 feet in the air in Edcouch.
 Angel Garcia said he's worked as a welder and repairman at Garcia Grain and Trading for 12 years.
 The father of three said something went horribly wrong during a repair on Tuesday.
 "I was repairing a damaged pipe line. I put on my harness and secured myself as much as I could. The problem was a cable that ran over the pipe," he said. "As I was descending, that cable made me lose my balance and I flipped over. So, I wasn't on the pipe anymore. I was under it."
 Garcia said after the falling off of the pipe and finding himself dangling 130 feet in the air, there wasn't much he could do but wait.
 "The only thing I was doing was praying and thinking that everything was going to be ok," he said.
 Garcia was rescued approximately an hour and a half later. He said he could hear screams and cheers from people on the ground happy to see that he was finally safe.
 Once on the ground, Garcia was rushed to the hospital. He explained being stuck in a harness nearly 12 stories high in the heat took a toll on his body.
 "Because of the time that I was up there, they told me I had built up fluid, which is why I will be in the hospital for about 4 to 5 days so that fluid can go away and not damage my kidneys," he explained.
 Garcia said he wanted to say one thing to his rescuers and supporters.
 "I would like to thank them on behalf of me and my family. They utilized everything in their reach to put me out of harm's way, and I'm very thankful to all the fire departments and all the people who have supported me with their prayers affection," he said.
 Garcia said most of all he is just grateful to be alive.
 He is looking forward to getting back to work but said he'll think twice before climbing a silo again.
 CHANNEL 5 NEWS will continue to track Garcia's condition and keep you updated with the very latest.

The State government will file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court challenging the High Court verdict on its plan to introduce English as medium of instruction from classes 1 to 6 in all government schools from the next academic year.
 “We are committed to introducing English as part of reforms to uplift the suppressed and oppressed classes. We will leave no stone unturned to fulfil the promise made by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh told _The Hindu_ on Wednesday.
 An order issued late on Tuesday night said as the court had observed that the freedom of selecting the medium of instruction should be given to the children and their parents rather than some school committees in primary sections, the Department of School Education has undertaken the task of eliciting parents’ choice.
 “We had submitted to the court the resolution of nearly 45,000 parents’ committees. Somehow, the court concluded that we did not give a choice to the parents. We want to conduct one more exercise through village volunteers,” said Mr. Suresh.
 ## Model format
 The Commissioner of School Education has prepared a model format which will be circulated among parents by the District Education Officers and the Mandal Education Officers through Village Secretariats.
 The district Collectors have been asked to instruct village and ward secretariats to elicit the the choice of the parents/guardians by strictly adhering to the protocols prescribed for COVID-19.
 Mr. Suresh said there was no reason for people to worry about the fate of Telugu which would continue to be a compulsory subject.
 “The government is clear in its plan to set up one Telugu medium school in every mandal headquarters. Students going to these schools will be given transport allowance. We also intend to continue other vernacular medium schools such as Urdu and Tamil,” he said.
 “We have made elaborate arrangements for English medium schools such as training the teachers and even printing new books. English medium schools will be a reality from the next academic year,” the Minister said.
 “After addressing the parents’ choice issue, the government will file an SPL in the apex court,” he said.

"The bookings I get -- it's kind of all over the place, except in Vegas. I play a specific remix house-music format when I'm out there, which is another reason I like it, because it's more of a party. It's a party, I guess, when you play a place like Vegas," he acknowledges.
 Aaron sees himself as an introvert who plays the role of an extrovert, as he's out nearly every night of the week. On five evenings, he hosts Forbidden Bingo, a traveling event he started eight years ago, when he was deejaying to small crowds at little bars around town.
 "I was trying to think, 'What can I do outside the box that would have a big following?' Because local DJs really don't have a following," he says. "I was like, 'You know what? I like playing bingo. I wonder if we could do a bingo where we give away sex toys. Nobody else is doing it. There's no other concept out there.'"
 So he got Romantix and Si Novelties to sponsor Forbidden Bingo, which he started at Maloney's Tavern. When Maloney's closed, he moved it over to Marion Street Tavern (now the Wild Corgi Pub). He's also expanded to Live@Jack's downtown on Thursdays, Bout Time Pub & Grub in Arvada on Tuesdays, and Bout Time's Sheridan location on Wednesdays.
 Over the years, he's streamlined the Forbidden Bingo process. He knows how to make it work, and says he has nearly a hundred bars begging him to bring the event to them.
 "We'll do a brunch occasionally, and we'll do a one-off in a bar in Parker on a Sunday, and that draws like 300 people," he says. "Every bingo is that capacity that we do. Aside from, you know, those slow weeks or whatever due to weather, for the most part we're pretty much at capacity in every bar."
 But when the bars closed to slow the spread of coronavirus, Aaron panicked. He was frozen for days. He didn't know what to do.
 "Then I thought, 'Wait a second. We have almost 7,000 followers on our Forbidden Bingo Facebook page,'" he says. "So I was like, let me market to them and figure out how to do this. I basically scanned in a bunch of bingo cards, and we advertised it and I put tickets on sale."
 When Aaron would DJ and produce Forbidden Bingo nights in clubs, there wasn't a cover charge. But for the online version of Forbidden Bingo, which he and his callers put on via Zoom every weeknight at 7 p.m., he sells packages for $21, which includes four cards and seven games. He emails people their own cards with instructions on how to join the Zoom meetings.

As the coronavirus crisis swamps American hospitals, health-care workers like Paul are being infected at disproportionate rates. In the past two months, more than 9,000 health-care workers have contracted the virus, and 27 have died, a number that is likely underreported. Beyond the immediate physical risks, many front-line workers who survive the crisis will likely be contending with psychological ramifications long after the U.S.’s curve has flattened. “For medical staff, the repercussions of this months and years down the road are going to be extreme,” said Dr. Peter Shearer, Mount Sinai Brooklyn’s chief medical officer, in his dispatch from _New York_ ’s diary of a hospital series. “It goes back to the wartime analogy — people being in World War One being ‘shell-shocked.’ Now you call it PTSD.”

Metro has designated bus drivers "first responders" who should continue working unless they show symptoms. Since March, the union representing Metro employees has called for passenger limits, along with better protective equipment for bus drivers. Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 587 has also sought $2-per-hour hazard pay and a security presence on buses to tell riders "no mask, no ride."
 There are some exceptions to the new limits. If a bus has fewer passengers than the limit when a driver opens the door, the driver should allow everyone at the stop to board, even if that exceeds the limit, the bulletin said.
 While passing up additional riders, drivers will still stop when riders request and should let anyone at those stops on board, according to the bulletin.
 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) priority seating area at the front of buses should be limited to "ideally one customer at a time," the bulletin said. Riders in the priority seating area should be counted as part of the overall passenger count, but not passed up if the priority seating area is empty, according to the bulletin.
 Once the number of riders on the bus drops below the limit, the bulletin instructs drivers to begin picking up passengers again.

"You're hoping if you spin the chamber enough times, you're gonna catch a bullet," offers Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani by way of analysis early on. Not terribly insightful, considering we've just seen him (a) take what looks like a lethal bullet in a bloody flash-forward and (b) jump off a cliff so high even Thor would've thought twice about taking the plunge. Farahani is one of world cinema's most striking actresses, and here, she has nothing to do for better part of two hours but deliver exposition, such as this line to describe the politics of the assignment: "Biggest drug lord in India versus biggest drug lord in Bangladesh." And yet, she finds her way into the field before the show's over, firing the two most important shots of the movie, and taking down a helicopter via rocket launcher for good measure.
 As for Rake, well, he's just a locomotive with nothing left to lose, barrelling his way through incredibly outmatched situations in berserker mode. His adversaries may outnumber him, but he proves to be pretty creative about using them against one another. Rake can grab a gangster by the arm, twist it in a direction the joint wasn't meant to bend and fire the weapon into the skull of an oncoming assailant. Or else, he might pick up a soldier and spin his body around so fast that it snaps the neck of another.
 It shouldn't surprise that Hargrave, who's something of a fight specialist, has some flashy moves up his sleeve. Working closely with cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (the Drive DP, who's come a long way since Latino, a movie awfully similar to the Ciudad graphic novel), Hargrave blocks and shoots the altercations in such a way that audiences can quickly read what's happening. Rake fights dirty, but the coverage is clean, emphasizing what an efficient improviser he is in the moment.
 His mission is to locate, liberate and return alive Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of the aforementioned Indian drug lord, from the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka, where he's being held fro ransom by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), a man so powerful he has the local military at his disposal. That would be tough enough if the man who'd hired him (Pankaj Tripathi) hadn't ordered his own security chief, Saju (Randeep Hooda), to swoop in and steal Ovi from his rescuers the moment he's been liberated. That's where Hargrave chooses to show off, initiating the single-shot setpiece meant to up the ante on this particular technique.
 It's worth noting that Kathryn Bigelow was among the early pioneers of this action-scene-as-oner craze a quarter-century ago with Strange Days, even if it's since become the obsession of a certain kind of male director, looking either for Oscars (such as Cuaron, Inarritu and Mendes) or the admiration of cinephiles and fellow film professionals (as in Atomic Blonde and John Wick 3). Other than calling attention to itself, it's not entirely clear why this approach -- which mirrors the style of first-person-shooter games -- has become so popular. If anything, it's bound to make movies from this period look dated the instant the fad blows over.
 Joe Russo's script is structured much like a game as well, serving up intimidating "level bosses" -- a teenage street hood with a vengeance, a general who happens to be the country's best sniper -- that Rake must defeat every so often before advancing in his quest, suddenly complicated by the fact that Asif has mobilized the military to shut down the city (Thailand bridges and streets double for Dhaka) and take out both Rake and his charge.
 The Russos' original graphic novel, Ciudad, took place on a different continent entirely, and the fact they could relocate it from South America to Southeast Asia suggests how little attention they've put into studying either place. It's the action that matters most to them, so check your brain going in. But if the only exercise you're getting is from the couch to the kitchen these days, it's liable to get your heart racing just a little, and that's not a bad thing.

CHICAGO (AP) — The Chicago City Council on Wednesday voted unanimously to approve the appointment of former Dallas Police Chief David Brown as the city's new police superintendent.
 Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced earlier this month that she had selected Brown, 59, to head the police force in the nation's third largest city. The council approved his appointment 50-0.
 Brown succeeds Interim Superintendent Charlie Beck, the retired Los Angeles police chief who assumed control of the 13,000-member police force while a national search was conducted to find a permanent replacement for Eddie Johnson. Lightfoot fired Johnson in December, just days after he announced his retirement, saying he had lied to her about an incident last October when he was found asleep at the wheel of his vehicle after having a drinks.

Zero-interest loans are to be made available to Jewish communities worldwide to provide immediate cash flow and help them weather the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus lockdown, the organizations providing the loans have announced.
 The Jewish Agency for Israel, together with its partners Keren Hayesod and Jewish Federations of North America, is launching the "COVID-19 Loan Fund for Communities in Crisis," the agency announced in a press release. The loans are to be made available in response to urgent calls from Jewish communities in Italy, Spain, South Africa and South America, among others, for immediate financial relief.
 Under the terms of the fund, organizations outside North America which are dedicated to providing services which are essential to the continuance of Jewish communities, and which are now at risk to survive the lockdown, will be offered interest free loans to allow them to continue.
 "We are dealing with an unprecedented crisis that is impacting every aspect of life, including the Jewish world," Jewish Agency Chairman of the Executive Isaac Herzog said.
 "The Jewish Agency, together with our partners at Keren Hayesod and JFNA, will work to ensure the continued existence of Jewish communities and their vital activities. The Jewish people are responsible for one another, now more than ever. And we welcome the support of all those that believe in Klal Yisrael."
 The initial phase of the Fund will make $10 million available, in loans of up to $350,000 per community or organization,  to allow for their continued survival. The loans will have to be paid at the end of the first year in four installments, over four years. Representatives from the three partner organizations will oversee the fund alongside an advisory committee of financial experts from Europe and South America.
 Organizations such as educational programs, youth groups, museums and other cultural outlets, and volunteer groups are all having to dig deep into any financial reserves they may have, but none will be able to last with zero income indefinitely, and many have already had to let staff members go.
 Keren Hayesod-UIA World Chairman Sam Grundwerg said: "Jewish communities all over the world are currently in real crisis, physically and emotionally, and in many places Jewish institutions are being devastated. Jews from all over the world have supported Israel from its establishment, and Israel - which bears a responsibility toward all Jews - is standing alongside these communities during these challenging times."
 Italy was an initial hotspot for the coronavirus in the early stages and entered lockdown ahead of most other countries; the country has now recording over 180,000 cases. It is also home to some of Europe's oldest Jewish communities, furnishing European Jewry with a rich legacy, and the modern State of Israel with significant financial support. Now, the organizations say, it's time to give back, to ensure the ongoing financial viability of those communities.
 "This is the hour for solidarity, to support a dedicated, Zionist community that has supported us for years and now needs support, until it can return to its glory. It is our moral duty as a global Jewish collective to be there for them and for many other communities in need at this difficult time," said Jewish Agency CEO Amira Ahronoviz.
 The partner organizations have said that any other philanthropic institutions who wish to partner with them are welcome to do so. Anyone interested should email danyellen@jafi.org.

McCarthy and Pelosi spoke Wednesday morning, according to the aide, and decided to form the bipartisan group. It will review the Democratic plan to allow voting by proxy so that lawmakers can cast votes for absent members. The group will also examine “reopening the House,” which has remained shuttered for the past month due to the coronavirus outbreak.
 Members of the House will be still returning to Washington Thursday to approve a $483 billion coronavirus aid package.
 Pelosi told Democrats that they will now also vote on the formation of a new select committee to keep tabs on how coronavirus funding is spent. Pelosi had announced that South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat, will chair the committee, but the House must vote for the panel to be formed.
 McCarthy wrote Pelosi a letter on Tuesday asking her to “establish a clear, safe, and effective plan for reopening Congress” and to include Republicans in the talks. He said it was time for Congress to get back to work because “our constituents expect us to rise to the occasion."

 There is no vaccine for the common cold virus. There is no sure fire vaccine for the flu from year to year and there is no vaccine for Covid-19 and there may never be a vaccine. We hope so but that is a reality.
 Social distancing and keeping businesses closed will not guarantee any of us from getting Covid-19, it only slows the spread and so far we have done a great job of that task. We are nowhere near the worst case scenarios of full hospitals and patients in the halls and running out of ventilators. As of our last report, CMH currently has no Covid-19 hospitalizations. The curve was soundly flattened.
 As a matter of fact, California may have experienced an early wave of Covid-19 before social distancing and it’s citizens emerged with a herd immunity that have made its recovery and overall hospitalizations miniscule in comparison to New York.
 I believe this virus is nothing to be dismissed but when there is no vaccine and it has such a long incubation period the best thing is to just weather the storm. Be cautious, protect the vulnerable and emerge on the other side after it has run its course.
 When I speak of reopening the economy, I do not mean returning to normal next week. My plan would probably take a month to fully employ.
 Currently we are not shut down, in reality. Convenience stores, grocery stores, auto parts stores, doctors, pharmacies, we are all still going about our lives and risking getting infected and that is apparently ok. But churches, volunteer and community service clubs, sit down restaurants, retail shops and other businesses are closed as “non-essential.” I think those relying on the services, income or paychecks would disagree.
 When I speak of re-opening the economy that is a misnomer. It is already open, just not fully and that is what I am urging happen soon. We are already open and experiencing the risk of getting the virus and now that the curve has been flattened for a month or more. Some herd immunity has already begun as millions have been infected and recovered (many who never exhibited symptoms).
 Here is what I suggest. Allow businesses that want to open but can limit those in the store to 15 or less do that immediately. Continue to practice social distancing and frequent hand washing. Masks should be encouraged and possibly required for the next two weeks.
 In two weeks, we should re-evaluate masks, social distancing and limiting volume in small businesses to 15.
 Let’s continue to lock down hospitals and nursing homes to restrict visitors. Let’s encourage elderly or those with immune challenges to stay home and take them food and supplies.
 We need normalcy to safely return. We need routine and the security of financial stability. We need our churches and regular worship … we need God now more than ever.
 Restaurants can open for dine in but only every other table to have a 6-foot buffer. Staff must wear masks and gloves.
 For those who think these measures are reckless, stay home. Do not participate. It is a free society, stay home.
 Ninety nine percent of those who contract the virus recover fully, many with just flu-like symptoms. We cannot risk our way of life and the economy when protecting the vulnerable would be far more practical.
 Stay safe and let’s ease back into a fully opened economy over the next two- four weeks. That is my suggestion and I would love to hear yours. Feel free to write a letter to the editor if you agree or disagree. You can call me names (as some have) but keep it PG as this is a family newspaper.
 There is no cure for a cold or the flu and while I hope we find one for Covid-19 we cannot wait to open our economy until one is found.

After joining Greenpeace for a sea expedition to learn more about the threats facing our oceans, she teamed with American Express in 2019 on an initiative to help protect the water.
 "At the end of the day, corporations have the power to drive insane amounts of consumer change, and consumers have the power to drive corporate change," Woodley told _Architectural Digest_. "American Express was witnessing that ocean conservation was an important topic to a lot of its consumers. And not only did they change their corporate policies to include the reduction of single-use plastic and become carbon neutral, but also by creating a campaign where consumers can directly be a part of an initiative to clean up shorelines."
 "We come from this planet," she continued, "and we go back to this planet when we're gone. And I think it's important to reintegrate that truth into our daily realities and our daily lifestyles. And it doesn't mean that we all need to be living in the woods or collecting our own spring water. But it does mean there's a responsibility to future generations to take care of this planet and to make sure that this planet exists in a sustainable way for them in the way that it has sustained life for us."

The upside momentum in DXY faltered in the mid-100.00s for the time being, sparking some near-term correction to the 100.00 neighbourhood at the time of writing. If sellers regain the upper hand, then the 55-day SMA at 99.17 should emerge as the initial contention ahead of weekly lows near 98.80.

While the US is the single biggest contributor to the WHO, Washington has consistently not paid its full dues. So halting payments that the Trump administration is already behind on may not be the financial hit that Trump hoped for. Still, Washington's current arrears--roughly $200 million--are not enough to deprive it of a vote at the World Health Assembly; that only happens if the arrears exceed what a member state should have paid for the previous two years.
 Trump can therefore continue to play to his base, undermining multilateralism by saying he won't pay, while still being able to vote and enjoy the privileges of membership for the time being. Despite Trump's threats, the US will still likely be able to undertake corridor diplomacy at the WHO's headquarters in Geneva--once social distancing restrictions are lifted, of course.
 More importantly, whenever the US has withdrawn from other global health initiatives in the past, other governments with a more internationalist worldview have generally covered the shortfall. For example, in 2016, Trump reinstated the global gag rule, prohibiting US taxpayer dollars going to any organization that offers abortion services. The restrictions took funding away from many family planning initiatives and health clinics around the world, leading to a series of harmful consequences for women and children, including many in low- to middle-income countries.
 At the time, Scandinavian governments stepped in to plug some of the gap. It was unsurprising, then, to see these same governments increase their contributions to the WHO last week.
 Ultimately, while the Trump administration's cutoff of funds to the WHO is sending shockwaves across the global health community, and may hurt the WHO's influence among some governments that support Trump's decision, there is likely still enough multilateral support for it to weather this storm.

DXY extends the weekly upside beyond the 100.00 mark. Broad- based risk aversion keeps dominating the global markets. House Price Index, EIA's weekly report next on tap. The greenback, in terms of the US Dollar Index (DXY), is prolonging the upbeat momentum beyond 100.00 the figure on Wednesday. US Dollar Index propped up by risk-off trade The index is advancing for the third consecutive session on Wednesday, looking to consolidate the breakout of the key barrier at 100.00 the figure and always underpinned by the prevailing risk-off sentiment. In fact, the risk-associated complex remains under pressure on the back of unabated concerns over the devastating effects of the coronavirus on the economy, all morphing into extra legs to the buck and depressing US yields. By the same token, the US Senate approved another relief package, this time worth $484 billion and oriented to lend extra support to the US economy and hospitals.

What to look for around USD DXY is extending the optimism in the first half of the week and manages to retake the area above the 100.00 barrier, although some resistance appears to have emerged near 100.50 for the time being. The recent improved sentiment in the dollar has been propped up by the "fly-to-safety" environment, as investors continue to prefer the dollar to the rest of the safe haven universe. In the meantime, all the attention remains on the COVID-19 amidst countries extending their lockdown periods, speculation of a global recession and further deterioration of fundamentals. On the supportive side of the buck, its status of "global reserve currency" and store of value underpins its safe haven preference. US Dollar Index relevant levels At the moment, the index is gaining 0.07% at 100.28 and a break above 100.48 (weekly high Apr.21) would aim for 100.49 (78.6% Fibo retracement of the 2017-2018 drop) and then 100.93 (weekly/monthly high Apr.6). On the flip side, the next support emerges at 99.18 (55-day SMA) seconded by 98.82 (monthly low Apr.15) and finally 98.27 (weekly low Mar.27).

A regular at the annual People's Climate March and producer of multiple documentaries about environmental issues, the Oscar winner established his eponymous foundation back in 1998 to promote awareness and he's been active in causes allied in the fight against climate change ever since. Over the years DiCaprio has sat on the board of the World Wildlife Fund, Global Green USA, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare; was named UN Messenger of Peace on Climate Change in 2014; and he spoke at the United Nations in 2016 before the signing of the Paris Agreement to combat global warming. He even met with then-president-elect Trump to try to get his ear on the issue, but to no avail.
 In 2018 the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation announced $11 million in new grants pledged to the non-profit's six main programs--Wildlands Conservation, Oceans Conservation, Climate Change, Indigenous Rights, Transforming California, and Innovative Solutions--bringing the organization's total financial impact to over $100 million. And in 2019 the foundation became part of Earth Alliance, a super-organization co-chaired by DiCaprio that pools the resources of several funds to further the fight against climate change and attacks on biodiversity.
  _And_ , he was one of the first big movie stars you saw driving a Prius.

BERLIN (AP) — Authorities in Berlin are setting up temporary bicycle lanes to meet demand for safe cycling on the German capital's streets during the coronavirus pandemic, angering some motorists.
 The move is intended to help people get about the city without having to use public transport, where social distancing can be difficult.
 Felix Weisbrich, who oversees street planning in Berlin's district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, said miles of new ‘pop-up' bike lanes now being set aside for cyclists would have been implemented in the long term anyway.

He questioned the plan to vote by proxy, asking Pelosi: “What are the details of this proposal, how will it avoid potential abuses of power, and when do you expect this proposal to be made public for the necessary scrutiny and member input that changing 200 years of House precedent would merit?”
 The Democratic plan would allow proxy voting on future business during the pandemic, a first for Congress, which has required in-person business essentially since its founding. It would require House members to notify the House clerk of their intent to submit specific instructions to a specific lawmaker to cast the vote on their behalf.
 The proxy plan had been considered as an alternative to remote voting, with no lawmakers present. A report by House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, who was tasked with studying the options, said remote voting poses too many logistical and security issues to be implemented.
 Pelosi announced that the members of the bipartisan committee will include Pelosi, McCarthy, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and the top Democrats and Republicans on the House Rules and Administration committees.

 The family members of the infected persons were shifted to quarantine centres for observation. Ongole accounts for 30 cases in the district.
 Collector P. Bhaskar who rushed to the Government General Hospital to take stock of the situation, said that from now, testing of swabs of the patients would be done in the district itself.

 “We’re going to have some things that we talk to them about,” Loomis said, adding that Payton’s message to players was essentially, “Pay attention to your family. Pay attention to keeping yourself and your family safe. Abide by the orders of each of the states that you’re in. We’ll handle the rest of it.
