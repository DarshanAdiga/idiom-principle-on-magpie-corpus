Not only can you say I am a professional, but you could also say compassionate, and I understand what you are feeling at this time.”The mid-size hospital only has 511 beds, which is why 750 recoveries mean so much to many at the medical center.

With the district’s schools typically hosting other municipalities for summer camp programs, those are up in the air at the moment as well.
 “As stay at home orders and mass gathering restrictions are extended, we’re not anticipating that much will be going on in the district this summer, but we’re trying to keep the lines of communication open with everybody right now, and as we learn things we try to communicate as early and as transparently and as frequently as we can,” Dormer said. “The Office of Public Health in Montgomery County has been an absolute leader in this. The Commissioners and all the health officers have done an outstanding job of communication.”
 Encumbered by vastly diminished tax revenue, the board is currently working on a plan to adopt a budget sometime in June for the next fiscal year.
 “Transfer tax is really non-existent; because of the stay at home orders people aren’t selling properties, “ Dormer noted. “The state is preparing us that their tax collections could be off in the billions and there will be a trickledown effect with that. We also recognize with our homeowners that an increasing number of people are out of work, so in helping our homeowners out we’re (considering) a delayed tax on school property taxes, or a rebate program. We’re discussing all options to try to be as supportive and as cognizant of our taxpayers and their struggles, while balancing that at the end of the day we have a $160 million operation we have to run.”
 In the Continuity of Education department, the district has now distributed 4,000 Chromebooks to enhance distance learning.
 “We’re asking the board to approve the purchase of another 1,300 Chromebooks,” Dormer said. “We’re doing our best to support distance learning through technology and through non-digital learning experiences (paper packets). We gave out several packets last week to have our students academically engaged moving forward with planned instruction for the last eight weeks of the school year.”
 The print learning experience is an essential resource, Dormer allowed.
 “We recognize that not all families have Internet access or the ability for personal devices . There might a household where there’s one Chromebook and three kids are trying to share it. So we just wanted to give students the opportunity to learn and master skills and knowledge and we wanted to make sure that we had multiple modes of learning available to all our students and families.”
 The board is considering alternatives to the traditional graduation ceremony.
 "We're talking about having a virtual ceremony, or some drive-up options. We're looking to see what we can do to celebrate students and all their hard work in achieving their high school diploma," Dormer said. "We'll have a separate committee working on that — the high school administration, students and other key stakeholders, and will probably make an announcement sometime next week."

In any case, there are reasons to think that those right-wing Christians exercising caution over possible damage to their religion’s reputation in light of current events are on to something. Scholars have shown that right- wing Christians’ unpopular culture wars, in both Europe and the United States, are a driver of secularization.

WASHINGTON -- New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had a functional and effective conversation with President Donald Trump on Tuesday and tried to keep the focus on testing and state budget problems.
 "We have a tremendous job that we have to get done and put everything else aside and do the job, and the tone of the conversation was very functional and effective," Cuomo said in an interview with MSNBC after the White House meeting.
 "I stayed focused on what we were there to talk about and for me the substantive agenda was testing - 'Who does what? How do we get it up the scale?' - and somebody has to stand up for funding for the states."
 With social distancing and lockdowns showing some positive results, Cuomo said on Monday he could begin to consider how to reopen a state that ranges from New York City, with more than 8 million people, to farm country and sparsely populated towns.
 The New York governor, a Democrat who has clashed with Trump during the outbreak, did not discuss details of their talk. The White House did not immediately provide an account of the meeting.
 Cuomo said he sought a face-to-face conversation with the Republican president to hash out issues around the need for more testing capability.
 "We have to get this ironed out. This is a very big issue. It's important for states that have a more difficult time reopening like New York. It is how you educate yourself as you're making your reopening decisions," Cuomo said.
 He said testing volume needed to increase tenfold and leaders needed to discuss how the federal government can help and what the states can do to make enough tests available.
 "That is the issue for the country right now I think," Cuomo said. "It's a benchmark - 'Where are we? Are we on the increase, are we on the plateau or are we on the descent?'" (Reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Sandra Maler and Dan Grebler)

TORONTO (AP) — Police fanned out across more than a dozen crime scenes Monday after a rampage by a gunman disguised as a police officer left at least 18 dead and homes in smoldering ruins in rural communities across Nova Scotia — the deadliest mass shooting in Canada's history.
 Officials said the suspect, identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, also died in the weekend attack. Authorities did not provide a motive for the killings.
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Chief Superintendent Chris Leather told a news conference Monday that police expect to find more victims once they are able to comb through all the crime scenes, some of which were houses set ablaze as victims were inside, adhering to government calls to stay at home because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Leather said police teams were spread out at 16 locations across central and northern Nova Scotia. He said some of the victims knew Wortman, and some didn't.
 "We're relatively confident we've identified all the crime scenes," Leather said. "We have had five structure fires, most of those being residences, and we believe there may be victims still within the remains of those homes which burnt to the ground."
 The dead included a police officer. Another was wounded by gunfire and was recovering at home, Leather said.
 "The 18 innocent lives lost will be remembered throughout Canada's history," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted how close-knit the small province of Nova Scotia is.
 "The vast majority of Nova Scotians will have a direct link with one or more of the victims. The entire province and country is grieving right now as we come to grips with something that is unimaginable," Trudeau told a news conference.
 "The pandemic will prevent us from mourning together in person, but a vigil will be held virtually to celebrate the lives of the victims," Trudeau added, saying it would take place Friday night through a Facebook group.
 Trudeau asked the media to avoid mentioning the name of the assailant or showing his picture.
 "Do not give this person the gift of infamy," he said.
 The 12-hour rampage began late Saturday in the rural town of Portapique, about 60 miles north of Halifax, where police warned residents to lock their doors and stay in their basements as the attack unfolded. The town, like all of Canada, already had been adhering to government stay-at-home advice.
 Several bodies were later found inside and outside one house on Portapique Beach Road, the street where the suspect lived, authorities said.
 Bodies also were found at other locations within about a 30-mile area from the neighborhood where the shootings began, and authorities believe the shooter may have targeted his first victims but then began attacking randomly.
 Authorities said the gunman wore a police uniform and made his car look like a Royal Canadian Mounted Police cruiser.
 "His ability to move around the province undetected was surely greatly benefited by the fact that he had a vehicle that looked identical in every way to a marked police car," Leather said, adding that the gunman also either was wearing a police uniform or very good copy.

Vemos con incredulidad cómo el Estado Mexicano se está desbaratando producto de las actuales circunstancias que en lo individual rebasan a cualquier persona. Hablamos de salud, de economía, del precio y producción del petróleo, de la energía, de las bolsa de valores, del tipo de cambio, del aislamiento de las personas y tantas preocupaciones que nos desbordan a diario.
 Pero en el centro de todo eso que hoy padecemos, debiera estar, como columna principal, soportando que el techo de nuestro país no se nos venga encima, la transparencia, el conocimiento y la competencia.
 Es un crimen lo que ha hecho el subsecretario Hugo López-Gatell por cualquier arista que se le mire. Reconozcamos su tesón por salir diariamente a dar la cara, a manera de malabarista de miles de pelotas-datos a entretener al pueblo, haciendo pensar que el Gobierno, como parte del Estado mexicano tiene todo bajo control, pero creer en eso es difícil cuando vemos cómo al malabarista poco a poco se le van cayendo las pelotas-datos.
 Claro que su actuar no es distinto a tantas personas que buscan beneficiarse o mantenerse falseando la verdad. Por encubrimiento, por ignorancia o por incapacidad nunca desarrollan un proyecto que incluya una estrategia y un plan de acción preventivo, operativo y correctivo.
 Siempre habrá un buen motivo que justifique nuestras acciones hasta que, esas acciones equivocadas u omitidas, lastiman los intereses de terceros, ya sea en su vida, en su salud, en su economía o en su libertad.
 Ahora que estamos ávidos de héroes, empecemos por reconocer a quienes a pesar de las circunstancias actúan con dignidad de ser humano, y enfrentan las más arduas calamidades sin perder su dignidad y ética que debe ser inherente. Observo a millones de personas, mujeres y hombres con entereza y templanza enfrentar este tsunami de crisis, y para ellos y por ellos, México merece lo mejor de cada uno de nosotros.
 El pasado 8 de abril dije que Carlos Salazar, Alfonso Romo y Hugo López-Gatell debían renunciar. Carlos Salazar se equivoca cuando piensa que representa a todos los empresarios y en tal virtud ha actuado. El presidente del CCE representa los intereses de sus afiliados que son cámaras y asociaciones empresariales, es decir, por encima del presidente del CCE están sus agremiados, no debajo de él, se debe a ellos. No hay CCE sin sus agremiados, pero sí hay agremiados sin el CCE. A pesar de una buena relación de cordialidad con el gobierno, no hubo entendimiento, por lo que ya no es un interlocutor válido de las cámaras y asociaciones empresariales que representa.
 Alfonso Romo tampoco es un interlocutor válido representando al gobierno frente al empresariado mexicano. No se le puede negar su empatía y buena comunicación con el empresariado, pero tampoco logró un entendimiento con el sector productivo del país al no tejer una estrategia con sector productivo.
 Hugo López-Gatell debe renunciar porque su acto circense de malabarear las pelotas-datos todos los días a las 19 horas está agotado. Ante la emergencia por el Covid-19 urge dar confianza a la población y a todos los líderes de los distintos sectores para que todos, sociedad y gobierno, nos sumemos a un plan estratégico que le dé rumbo a la crisis sanitaria que vivimos.

The GPA for the classes of 2021, 2022 and 2023 will be based on the end of the fall semester. That will affect students, both current and future transfers, in those classes until they graduate.


  The trustees spent nearly an hour going back and forth on possible ways to deal with grades and high school students’ GPA and class ranks.


  “This whole thing breaks my heart, just the whole situation that we’re in. There’s not a single decision that is the one right decision. Someone is going to end up higher, someone is going to end up lower on both sides,” school board member Chris Flor said. “There is no win in any of this.”


  Several trustees agreed with Flor.


  “Everyone’s heart is the right place. There is no good answer here,” board Vice President Jeff Norwood said. “There is not a fair answer. It does not exist.”


  Alcozer and Montgomery — both of whom serve on the school board’s policy committee, which recently discussed the grading resolution — wanted the third nine-week grading period to be the cut off point for all students’ GPAs. The third nine weeks ended before spring break and in-person classes were canceled.


  “That third nine weeks is an amazingly difficult nine weeks. Our teachers work hard. Our students work hard. We are saying that is a valid measurement for a senior’s GPA,” Montgomery said, adding that those grades could make a difference when current juniors apply for college. “While I respect this is a terribly difficult decision, I can’t rest without counting the third nine weeks in the GPA.”


  Alcozer, the policy committee chairman, described the situation simply: If a policy is good enough for the seniors, it’s good enough for the other three classes.


  “I think to me uniformity is important in terms of the application of calculating GPAs,” he said. “I don’t want all of that work those kids did to disappear.”


  Board Secretary Janet Leigh brought up that students are told their semester grade is their average.


  “Students actually work toward that goal of making sure their GPA and class rank, if that’s important, is final at semester, and then they work toward something else in the end,” Leigh said. “But we weren’t anywhere near that second half.”


  What is and isn’t fair has shifted dramatically in recent weeks, Trustee Ty Taggart said.


  “I will just say that I’m living in a house with a senior right now, and the definition of the word fair has changed a lot for us. I think what we have to do is consider what’s good for the most involved,” he said.


  The resolution was drafted by Belton ISD’s top administrators. That was enough for board President Suzanne McDonald to support it.


  “I know … that we’ve got some folks in place who have the heart of the kids in mind first, and I feel like I know they have done their due diligence and made the right decision for all kids,” she said. “Everybody will not get the same treatment. Some kids will get hurt unfortunately. And I respect all of the work that they’ve done.”


  Superintendent Matt Smith said setting policies like this is the hardest part for the school board.


  “I can tell you that the administration shares all of the concerns that you all have said here,” he said. “Thank you for engaging in this tough conversation tonight, and for putting your heart and soul into deciding what’s best for our kids.”

This week is usually when kids in the Muslim community get excited about an annual trip to see the new moon that marks the start of Ramadan, says Cindy Jadayel, a member of the Mosque of Mercy in Ottawa.
 But she says it'll be one of many community events that will be cancelled during Ramadan this year.
 The month of Ramadan -- in which Muslims go without food or drink from sunrise to sunset every day -- often features gatherings where families and friends break fast and pray together. It's set to start on Thursday based on the Islamic lunar calendar, and will last until May 23.
 The moon sighting trip follows an early tradition where religious leaders would declare the start of the new month.
 "(Kids) get excited about it," said Jadayel, who works on the committee for the Mosque of Mercy.
 "There's times when you drive out and you see something, that it's a new month," she said, adding that there's always a sense of suspense because it can often be too cloudy to clearly see the moon.
 Those events, as well as nightly congregational prayers and community events at the mosque, will be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Not having the community aspect of Ramadan this year "is going to be challenging," said Jadayel.
 "We have to work harder this year to have families happier in the home because we can't go out and celebrate with others."
 Sallah Hamdani, a former president of the Islamic Society of St. Catharines, Ont., says Muslims will try and look on the bright side of the time alone this year.
 "You might not have to focus on hosting a dinner," said Hamdani, pointing out that it can be stressful for families to put together elaborate dinners at home while already dealing with a difficult fast.
 "Instead you can enjoy that dinner or breaking the fast with your immediate family and creating a new custom that you probably had not implemented previously."
 Muslim communities across Canada have already seen sweeping changes as physical distancing rules came into affect last month.
 Daily prayers and weekly sermons have been cancelled, as well as Arabic classes, day camps and Qur'an readings that are often hosted by mosques.
 "It was a shock, but since then we have almost all of our programs online," said Jadayel, who said they have hundreds of students studying online in various classes, as well as an online pre-recorded sermon that is posted every week.
 She says congregants are also meeting on group calls to maintain a sense of community.
 "We're meeting every week and we can feel that sense of gathering, it's like we're in the same room together."
 In St. Catharines, Hamdani says one of the hardest events during physical distancing this year will be Eid al-Fitr, a multi-day holiday that celebrates the end of Ramadan.
 "Not being able to get together for Eid will have a larger impact on the community than any other thing," said Hamdani.
 "Whether you are a practising Muslim or not, Eid is a day of joy and a day of getting together and remembering your family."
 Jadayel also pointed out that some mosques may see a drop in donations because up to half of all donations come during Ramadan.
 Nonetheless, the Mosque of Mercy is still trying to provide for the community during Ramadan, and is offering packages of non-perishable food to seniors and people with compromised immune systems -- for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
 "We don't want people to feel like they're in dire straits and that there's no one available to help them," she said.

SEATTLE (AP) — Boeing and at least one other U.S. heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production and some states rolled out aggressive reopening plans Monday, despite nationwide concerns there is not enough testing yet to keep the coronavirus from rebounding.
 The reopenings came amid economic gloom, as futures plunged below zero on Monday and stocks and Treasury yields also dropped on Wall Street. The cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63. It was at roughly $60 at the start of the year.
 Boeing said it was putting about 27,000 people back to work this week building passenger jets at its Seattle-area plants, with virus-slowing precautions in place, including face masks and staggered shifts. Doosan Bobcat, a farm equipment maker and North Dakota's largest manufacturer, announced the return of about 2,200 workers at three factories around the state.
 Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain and Germany. Parts of the continent are perhaps weeks ahead of the U.S. on the infection curve of the virus, which has killed about 170,000 people worldwide, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.
 Businesses that start operating again in the U.S. are likely to engender good will with the Trump administration at a time when it is doling out billions in relief to companies. But the reopenings being announced are a drop in the bucket compared with the more than 22 million Americans thrown out of work by the crisis.
 In a dispute that has turned nakedly political, President Donald Trump has been agitating to restart the economy, singling out Democratic-led states and egging on protesters who feel governors are moving too slowly.
 Some states — mostly Republican-led ones — have relaxed restrictions, and on Monday announced that they would take further steps to reopen their economies.
 Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced that gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors were among businesses that could reopen Friday, as long as owners followed strict social distancing and hygiene requirements.
 The governor said a decline in emergency room visits by people with flu-like symptoms indicated that infections were going down. But he also acknowledged that Georgia had lagged in COVID-19 testing and announced new initiatives to ramp it up.
 Texas on Monday began a week of slow reopenings, starting off with state parks, while officials said that later in the week, stores would be allowed to offer curbside service. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced Monday that businesses across most of the state would begin reopening as early as next week, although the order did not cover counties with the largest cities, including Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Both states are led by Republicans.
 Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he would allow hospitals to begin performing elective procedures if the facilities met an unspecified set of criteria, while Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that he would let his statewide stay-at-home order expire next week as long as strict social distancing and other individual protective measures continued.
 But governors from many other states said they lacked the testing supplies they need and warned they could get hit by a second wave of infections, given how people with no symptoms can still spread the disease.
 "Who in this great state actually believes that they care more about jet skiing than saving the lives of the elderly or the vulnerable?" Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remarked, referring to restrictions in place in her state. "This action isn't about our individual right to gather. It's about our parents' right to live."

The governor had positive news to share about testing, saying "our testing strategy is effective in doing the primary thing that it must do, and that is to give the state and local communities a snapshot about the extent to which COVID-19 is expanding or contracting in the State of Texas. And because those who are testing positive remains about the same percentage as they have been all along, it shows there has been no meaningful outbreak."

State Sen. Blake Tillery has been tapped for a powerful position overseeing budget negotiations in the Georgia Senate, replacing the late Sen. Jack Hill as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   
 Now in his second term, Tillery, R-Vidalia, will head one of the General Assembly's most influential committees, which is tasked with crafting a state budget each year before sending it to Gov. Brian Kemp.
   
 Hill, R-Reidsville, was one of the Legislature's longest-serving members before his death earlier this month at age 75. He had chaired the budget- wrangling committee since 2003.
   
 Tillery's district shares a border with Hill's in Southeast Georgia. In a statement Monday, Tillery highlighted how the coveted appropriations chairmanship will stay in Hill's region. He also praised Hill as "a mentor, teacher and friend."
   
 "No one can fill the shoes he leaves behind," Tillery said. "I'm humbled and proud his position as chairman will remain in our region."
   
 Tillery steps into the role at a time when the coronavirus is causing economic havoc in Georgia and across the country, driving unemployment numbers sky-high and hammering state revenues.
   
 Last week, Georgia State University researchers estimated the state could lose out on hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue in the coming months as businesses stay shuttered and people keep their distance from each other.
   
 Then on Monday, an analysis from the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute warned that the state budget for this fiscal year and next could be in the hole between $3 and $4 billion.
   
 Tillery is poised to play a major role in the coming weeks once the General Assembly reconvenes to pass a coronavirus-impacted budget for the 2021 fiscal year. State lawmakers have not met since mid-March after suspending the 2020 legislative session as concerns mounted over the virus.
   
 Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who presides over the Senate and picked Tillery for the post, said Tillery is well-equipped to help lead budget talks as the appropriations committee's former vice chairman.
   
 "Coupled with his thoughtful wisdom, he is perfectly poised to lead the Senate Appropriations Committee - especially as we prepare to tackle serious budgetary issues," Duncan said in a statement. "I am confident that he will succeed in this new role, because of his dedication to thoroughly understanding fiscal issues and his unbridled care for the people of this state."

The practice of wearing face masks to prevent the spread of germs is relatively new to most people in the US. But in other countries, such as Japan and China, it's common courtesy to wear a mask if you are feeling under the weather and need to leave your home. The US is experiencing severe shortages of disposable medical masks, so the CDC and other health authorities are directing people to use cloth face masks and coverings instead.


  Whether you make your own face mask, get a reusable mask or purchase disposable masks when they are in short supply, you can and should keep this habit going even beyond COVID-19. It's a small gesture that can go a long way when it comes to keeping people around you well.

San Marcos on Tuesday could become the first city in Texas to use the force of law to require police give a citation instead of arresting residents for many low-level, nonviolent crimes.


   


  The San Marcos City Council is weighing a vote to pass a cite-and-release ordinance that would limit arrests for minor crimes like marijuana possession or driving with an invalid license.


   


  Neighboring cities like Austin and San Antonio have both adopted cite-and- release resolutions, but San Marcos would be the first in the state to codify the ideas into law.


   


  Austin police drastically reduced the number of people arrested on misdemeanor charges last year after adopting "Freedom City" policies that called on police to end most discretionary arrests, in which an officer could have chosen to issue a citation instead.


   


  Although San Marcos city staff had recommended that the council instead approve a resolution like its neighboring cities, that will not be an option during Tuesday's vote.


   


  But Mano Amiga, a local social justice nonprofit that was the first to propose the ordinance to the council last year, said it was willing to postpone the vote in the wake of the deadly ambush on Saturday that killed a San Marcos police officer and wounded two other officers.


   


  "While we may not see eye to eye with San Marcos Police Department leadership on every policy issue, we do recognize the space they deserve to grieve and heal in the wake of this tragic event," the group said in a statement Monday.


   


  Mano Amiga initially proposed the ordinance after data provided by Hays County showed San Marcos police in 2018 had an 87% arrest rate for individuals who could have been cited instead. In 2019, it was 77%, according to the data provided by police last month.


   


  However, San Marcos police argued that the 2018 data was skewed because it did not include "street diversions," which are warnings given to those who break the law.


   


  One of the most vocal leaders in opposition of the ordinance is Jesse Saavedra, San Marcos police union president.


   


  Saavedra sent an email to council members in early April and, in notes about the ordinance written in red in an attachment to the message, said the union would recommend its members stop giving street diversions altogether if the ordinance is approved.


   


  While the ordinance would allow officers to arrest when "justified," Saavedra said such justification might be subjective and put officers at risk for lawsuits.


   


  "In an effort to protect its members, the SMPOA (police union) will advise its members to cite and release all offenders so the officers are never accused of 'not being justified' in their decision to arrest," Saavedra said, adding that everyone who had benefited from officer discretion in the past would be entered into the criminal justice system.


   


  The ordinance's justifiable reasons for arrest include if the person does not live in Hays County, is at risk of causing harm to themselves or others, is unwilling to provide proper identification, demands to be taken before a magistrate, has an outstanding warrant, or is suspected to have committed a crime not included in the ordinance.


   


  City Council Member Mark Rockeymoore on Friday afternoon said he interpreted Saaverda's email as a threat.


   


  "It is unfortunate the president of the police union has used that type of language and threatened our citizens of San Marcos," Rockeymoore said.


   


  Rockeymoore said the city's legal team assured him that officer discretion would not be jeopardized in any way if the ordinance was approved.


   


  The American-Statesman tried to reach Saavedra for comment, but he did not immediately respond.


   


  Interim Chief Bob Klett in a statement Friday said he believes many of the city's officers will continue to give verbal warnings when appropriate "because they are conscientious professionals who are not out to arrest in all instances."


   


  "However, it is understandable to think they are now very concerned about how their use of discretion will be scrutinized, particularly about their exposure to federal civil rights violations if they are perceived to violate the ordinance," Klett said.


   


  Jordan Buckley, spokesperson for Mano Amiga, said he hoped the ordinance, if approved, would help reduce the number of minority arrests for low-level offenses in San Marcos.


   


  Data released by Hays County showed San Marcos police could have given citations to but instead arrested all 72 African American low-level offenders incarcerated in 2018, according to Buckley.


   


  However, the city said one black person was cited and not arrested, according to Rockeymoore.


   


  Rockeymoore said he is in favor of the ordinance because "certain populations are being arrested more than others" in San Marcos.


   


  "We believe this ordinance will send a strong, clear message to the police union and everyone else that we would like our officers to exercise their discretion within certain perimeters," he said.


   


  In Saavedra's email to council members, the union president also voiced his concerns about minority arrests and citations in San Marcos.


   


  While the ordinance allows for discretion to provide warnings, Saavedra said officers may be accused of racism or bias if they cannot "provide the numerically identical number of written/verbal warnings to each race and ethnicity."


   


  If the ordinance is approved, council members said they would want arrests organized by race and ethnicity so disparities could be easily analyzed.


   


  However, Saavedra said police are not equipped to provide the data as requested.

Some conservative Christians, however, are exercising more caution and exhibiting awareness that Christians visibly behaving badly in the face of the pandemic could do lasting damage to the reputation of the faith. Citing a Lifeway study, Daniel Silliman reports for _Christianity Today_ that only 7% of Protestant churches continued to hold in-person services as of March 29. Unfortunately, the report doesn’t break down Protestant churches into narrower categories, which I suspect is deliberate sleight of hand meant to whitewash the reputations of radical charismatics and white evangelicals, who are clearly the worst offenders. And Silliman is worried: “The churches defying stay-at-home orders are outliers. But in the end, that may not matter,” he asserts, for those who are concerned about the church’s “witness” and the possibility that the general American public will stop taking conservative Christians’ crypto-theocratic “religious liberty” concerns seriously.

Bag closure clips have witnessed up surging demand in the developed market including the U.S., Canada, and other European countries. These bag closure clips are widely used for bakery purposes where bags of bread needs proper closure. In the developed market, there is an adoption of such closure devices. It is due to the high standard of living in the regions coupled with high acceptance of new products. Countries of North America and Europe are expected to drive the demand for bag closure clips during the next decade. In countries such as India and China, people use alternative closing solutions such as heat sealing for bakery goods, threads for fresh produce and others. Currently, there is limited demand for bag closure clips in countries such as India and China, but with the changing scenario, these countries are likely to adopt bag closure clips in the near future. MEA and Latin America regions are expected to witness average growth in the bag closure clips market during the forecast period.

Gary G. Stenlund      It is with sadness that we announce the unexpected passing of Gary G. Stenlund on 01 October 2019.      Born in Rouyn, Quebec, Canada on April 24, 1956, Gary was raised in Green Bay, WI, and graduated from West High School.      A strong supporter of the arts and humanities, Gary earned his degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He was a co- founder of Engineering Professionals, Inc., in Tampa, FL, and steered the company's growth for nearly thirty years. He was most proud of the design work his company contributed to the many art and science museums, nature conservancies, and education centers in the Bay area.      Gary attributed his affinity for engineering and design to the summers he spent at Road America in his youth, and was a lifelong racing fan.      An autodidact in many things, Gary studied and became adept in multiple languages, both spoken and coded; in bamboo cultivation, construction, and design; in painting still-life scenes in oil and acrylic; and in photography.      Gary was a world traveler. His research in history and geneaology took him to places from Cuba and the Caribbean to the family farm in Canada. The trip he recollected most fondly were the weeks spent in Iceland, studying geothermal energy and sampling local cuisine.      Known for his extraordinary intellect, Gary is equally celebrated as a man who cared deeply about others, expressing himself in the quiet dignity of right action in lieu of words.      Preceding him in death are his father, Ronald, and Gary's grandparents, aunts, and uncles. Following him in death are his mother, Denise Gagne, and best friend, Tim Perz. He is survived by his other mother, Mary, of Green Bay; his siblings and their spouses; and his aunts, uncles, and cousins.      In light of current events, the memorial service tentatively scheduled for June has been suspended.      In gratitude, Gary's family requests memorial donations to

The light at the end of the tunnel is becoming visible, as he put it, and he believes the community will come out stronger on the other side.
 The invitation to take part in the conference came from the governor's office just yesterday. In an interview with the News and Tribune following the presser, Moore said that though Zoom calls aren't necessarily his go-to method of communication, he was pleased that perspective from his part of the state was sought.
 One of the major points he wanted to express was the resilience of each individual and their willingness to step up in times of crisis, like now.
 “I find a little comfort in the fact that for as dark of a reality we're living in, I’m seeing a lot of good in people," Moore said. "It’s refreshing to see in a very dark time in history that there are very good people making sacrifices to make other people’s lives a little better. I want to make sure that everybody acknowledges that everybody has stepped up... Everywhere I go, people are spreading positive messages."
 It gave Moore a feeling of pride that Holcomb, someone he considers a friend, gave a platform to the Ohio River Valley. Moore said he has taken that effort to communicate to the local level as well.
 Over the past few weeks, Moore said he has made sure to reach out to neighboring communities like Utica and Sellersburg. He compared it to neighbors picking up groceries for their neighbors in an effort to make sure they have everything needed to hunker down comfortably.
 Keeping Louisville in the fold is also a much-needed step, with Moore noting that he and Mayor Greg Fischer have spoken multiple times during the lockdown.
 "We have a walking bridge that a couple thousand people are crossing every month," Moore said. "Economically, Jeffersonville benefits a great deal from the residents of Louisville. I’ve always said that I feel like Louisville is the best next door neighbor I’ve ever had. I think people over there have recognized what’s going on. I think that works both ways. I love Louisville. I think Mayor Fischer has done an incredible job for his city. "
