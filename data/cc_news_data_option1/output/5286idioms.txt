The CDC lifted at the end of October its longstanding no-sail order for ships plying U.S. waters but in its place imposed detailed requirements for the resumption of cruising.
 The Port of San Diego said that after Holland America reached out about bringing its ships here to initiate the certification process, it was willing to oblige because of the long-term economic benefit to the region.
 “We’re one of their main home ports and we do want crews to come back,” said Adam Deaton, a senior trade representative with the port. “It’s about giving themselves time to get resituated, and they will come back in the fall to do the full season and hopefully by then we will have the full rollout of vaccines. Our goal is to support them and the tourism economy once they get back up and running.”
 Elvejord says it is hard to know how long the Holland America ships will remain in San Diego, given the involved process for securing clearances from the CDC but he expects it will be at least two months. The line, which has paused its schedule until the end of March, is hopeful it will be ready in time to start the Alaska cruise season and possibly the tail end of the San Diego cruise season, which ends in June.

Barred from sailing for the last nine months because of the pandemic, several cruise ships are making their way to San Diego this month, but don’t expect to see thousands of passengers boarding or disembarking from the ocean liners.
 The extended visit by the Holland America cruise ships is the first step toward getting certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the time when they will be able to begin welcoming passengers aboard next year.
 For now, it’s not likely San Diego will see cruise lines resuming voyages until at least the spring, but even then it remains uncertain how many ships that normally sail out of the port will have met all the federal requirements.
 The first of the four Holland America ships coming here — the Koningsdam — arrived at the B Street Pier on Wednesday. Because the vessels had not previously been in U.S. waters, they are taking that step now in order to begin laboratory testing of crew members on board. It is part of the first phase of the CDC process for the restart of cruising, which also requires the eventual launch of simulated voyages to test the ships’ ability to manage any outbreaks of COVID-19 on board.

Both Hunters were indicted in 2018 in a sweeping accusation alleging they diverted some $250,000 in political donations for personal use. They were accused of using the money to pay for video games, oral surgery, airfare for the family’s pet rabbit and the congressman’s getaways with girlfriends.
 They each pleaded not guilty initially but Margaret agreed to admit to a single felony charge in June 2019. She also agreed to work with prosecutors and testify against her husband. In light of her cooperation, she received eight months of home confinement and three years probation at sentencing.
 Duncan Hunter entered a guilty plea to the same charge last December and was sentenced to 11 months in federal custody. Before he was pardoned Tuesday, he was due to report to prison next month.

But the program was controversial. There were no credit score requirements. All borrowers needed was at least 10 percent equity in their property. Critics said PACE lenders charged high interest rates and origination fees, especially compared with other financing methods such as a second mortgage.
 Also, homeowners sometimes didn’t realize that the financing was paid off through their property tax bills, making it akin to a tax lien on their property. That caused headaches when they tried to sell or refinance mortgages.
 Legislation in 2018 tightened credit requirements, among other things. The result was a steep drop in Renovate America’s PACE originations, which plunged to $134 million last year. The company discontinued PACE financing in October.
 To make up for PACE losses, the company dramatically cut costs. It reduced headcount from 644 in early 2017 to 115 workers as of Dec. 9.

GENEVA — When Bob Schick arrived at Lyons National Bank in 1994, the venerable financial institution had two branches — both in the town where its beginnings date back to the early 1800s.
 How things have changed over 26 years. Today, LNB has 16 locations in seven counties. Its assets have grown from $60 million in 1994 to $1.4 billion in 2020.
 “It was obvious to me that we needed to grow the bank or sell the bank,” said Schick.
 LNB’s board of directors opted for the former — and with great success.
 In all, Schick, 71, a native of Buffalo who now lives in Geneva, has worked more than five decades in banking.
 Changes are coming, though. On Jan. 1, Schick is turning over his chief executive officer title to Tom Kime, 66, who became bank president three years ago. The moves are part of a management succession plan long in the works, said Schick.
 Schick will stay on as chairman of the bank’s Board of Directors and may take on special projects at the request of Kime, whom he recruited to join LNB in 2004 after serving for many years as president of the National Bank of Geneva, which is now part of Five Star Bank.
 The two men share the small-town bank philosophy focusing on personal relationships with customers. And both note that their cell phones are on their business cards in case a customer — or a potential customer — wants to speak with them.
 “We do well in small towns,” said Schick. “We immerse ourselves in that.”
 The two say there are no “bankers hours” anymore, that customers — from business owners with deep pockets to those with nothing more than checking accounts — deserve personal service when it’s convenient to them, not just the bank.
 LNB’s original expansion plan was focused on points east and west of Lyons. But when Kime and Five Star parted ways, Schick saw opportunity for LNB in Geneva and in other Finger Lakes communities.
 “That (Kime leaving Five Star) opened up Geneva,” said Schick.
 Schick said he sat on Kime’s porch at his Seneca Lake home in Fayette to talk about him moving over to LNB.
 The two say it’s been a great partnership. LNB had 26 employees in 1994 but through strategic expansion has grown to 239 employees in 2020, a year that has brought challenges because of the pandemic. Even with that, the company still added a new branch in Farmington, opening on Route 332 this past September.
 “It took a lot of people to pull that off,” Schick said LNB’s growth since he joined the company first as its chief financial officer. In 1998 he became bank president and CEO, succeeding John Werner.
 He said LNB took on the philosophy that if it had happy employees, customers and ultimately the shareholders would benefit.
 They also encourage that employees become involved in their communities, much of it on company time. It starts at the top. Both Schick and Kime serve on a number of community boards, as do their employees.
 “We have a lot of great people behind us who have the same kind of community beliefs,” Kime said.
 Schick feels good about handing the keys over to his friend and colleague.
 “The board (of directors) is very comfortable with Mr. Kime,” said Schick. “I feel really good” leaving Kime in charge.
 Kime noted that even with the economic effects of the pandemic, LNB still added well over 3,000 customers in 2020, which was close to on par with years when the economy was much stronger.
 Schick said Kime will provide the strategic direction of LNB — with he and the Board of Directors playing an active role as well.
 “He’ll put his own stamp on it,” Schick said.

“In 1956, a huge number of teenagers were refusing or neglecting to get the polio vaccine developed by Jonas Salk,” the Post reported. “So the March of Dimes recruited Elvis Presley, then 21 years old, to help. He agreed, smiling as he received an injection during a photo shoot just before he played ‘Hound Dog’ on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show.’ ”
 Afterward, when some teenagers got their vaccine, they received a photo of Elvis getting his shot. Maybe the same sort of plan would be useful today — have celebrities who command a lot of attention encourage people to get vaccinated.
 This, of course, leads to entertaining speculation about just who might convince vaccine skeptics to reconsider. Actors, singers and athletes come to mind immediately — people like Taylor Swift and Beyoncé have plenty of fans and social media followers. And a certain president who has millions of followers on Twitter also might make a difference.
 Going back to Elvis, a historian who studied his impact on polio shots reported that it was marginal. What made a bigger difference was when the March of Dimes asked teens why they weren’t getting the vaccine. It turned out some were scared of needles and others saw themselves as able to ward off any illness.
 So the March of Dimes turned teens into vaccine advocates. Popular students got their shot in front of classmates, and dances were staged for those who had been vaccinated.
 The PR efforts worked. By the end of the decade, polio cases were down by 90 percent. The country needs a similar effort today to put this virus behind us once and for all.

How to make meatballs round is a deep, philosophical question. Wegmans does it, but make them at home and isn’t one side always a little flat? Turn them often, of course, but still one side of that humble sphere loses air.
 You might wonder what this has to do with Diwali, Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa, New Year’s, Epiphany, or any other dark-season festival. I am not Italian, and my own family Christmas celebrations have never included meatballs, so what gives?
 Perhaps the answer is like the musical “Cats.” I have long speculated that Cats had its origin at a late-night party after too much drinking, with Andrew Lloyd Weber bragging he could write a successful musical about anything. Someone then challenged him to use T.S. Eliot’s peculiar poetry collection, “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.” Then again, it may be that the meatball is actually a penetrating question with serious social implications.
 If you’re not a _nonna_ , or didn’t grow up cooking with one, to make the perfect meatball is every bit as difficult as making a round, thin corn tortilla from scratch when you didn’t learn it at your mother’s or _abuelita’s_ side. Some things that look so easy take generations to make and the knowledge of generations to keep alive.
 Like cooking. Like life.
 Wisdom is a kind of knowing passed down through tradition rather that the content-instruction we get at school or from watching the Great British Baking Show. If we miss the infusion of wisdom as we grow, it is possible to garner it in later life but with more strain and less grace — like learning another language in adulthood.
 An unrecognized yet beautiful and blessed dimension of the winter holidays mentioned above, is that they are generational biomes in which both tradition and wisdom are shared and passed on. The passage takes place without notice, often wordless even. The things we always do, repeated year after year in family rituals, each with an ethnic tinge, are also vessels of the whys and where-they-came-froms that reveal deeper wisdom underneath layers of tradition.
 When we mate and become entangled with another family, we discover there are different traditions and, if we are trusted and fortunate, we get a glimpse of the wisdom within those differing rituals and customs. Then we understand — wisdom — that there is more than one way to do things, and as many reasons for doing them as there are customs. In other words, we grow.
 What do we lose when we commercialize these holidays to the point they become rote consumer events? The unique traditions and ways of doing things become endangered, flattened into a glossy uniform image without a soul. Instead of making cookies, we buy them. Instead of making presents with the particularities of the person in mind, we order them. Instead of cooking with children or grandchildren at our side, we order out or find it pre-made. Instead of making our decorations together, we buy them.
 What gets left behind in this one-size-fits-all commercializing of traditions is the flow of wisdom moving as if by osmosis from one generation to the next. And that is what meatballs have to do with it.

Given that we’re just a few days from the opening of the winter transfer market, it’s guaranteed that the rumour mill is about to go into overdrive.
 One of the more left-field links in recent days has been reports tying Barcelona with Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi as detailed by Mundo Deportivo.
 His agent, Emre Ozturk, posted a photo on Instagram of him outside Camp Nou saying “ready for the meeting,” leading many to assume that he was negotiating a potential transfer to Barcelona for his client.
 Sources within the club consulted clarified that the meeting was a courtesy rather than something born out of genuine interest, admitting the meeting did take place but maintaining that nothing will come of it.
 Mustafi, now recovered from his recent injury, has fallen down the pecking order at Arsenal. He’s played eight games this season across all competitions, just twice in the Premier League.
 His contract expires come season’s end, making him an affordable option, and he already knows La Liga quite well through his time with Valencia.
 Despite all these positive points, Barcelona’s number one target is said to quite clearly be Manchester City’s Eric Garcia. The Blaugrana tried for him in the summer only to deem it financially unfeasible, and are expected to move again this coming winter.
 The emergence of Ronald Araujo and Oscar Mingueza, however, who’ve performed very well since coming into the team, has made their situation more relaxed.

San Diego, which normally has a relatively robust cruise season between the fall and spring months, has lost nearly the entire season, with 119 cruises canceled since March. That translates to a $200 million hit to the regional economy, affecting everyone from restaurant and lodging businesses to transportation and security companies.
 For the upcoming 2021-22 season, Holland America has scheduled 33 cruise calls, down significantly from the 47 it had planned for 2020-21. But that was also before the cruise line sold four of its ships earlier this year, which contributed to the downsized operation in San Diego.
 For the remainder of the season, San Diego still has 54 sailings on the books for various lines, but it’s unknown how many of those will remain, Deaton said. Each line has separate plans, all of which are still dependent on sign- off from the CDC.
 “I think the ships coming here is an encouraging step that shows cruising is on its way back and on the path to returning,” Deaton said. “Things aren’t back to normal but we’ll start seeing revenue coming back although I don’t know that we’ll see full ships. I’ve heard from various lines it looks like 60 percent on board initially, maybe ramping up to 75 percent and by the second season, I think you’d see full ships again.”

However, the Nash scores over its illustrious rivals in the contemplative _Romanza_ and _Tema con variazioni_ movements, where the players deliver even greater poetry and variety of moods.

 Time behind bars meant interrogation, missed meals, and lights on 24 hours a day. Once in the public prison, Kevin shared a cell with 14 people, forced to sleep head to head while other prisoners paced the aisles on watch.

Weber, a Democrat like Newsom and Padilla, served as a member of the San Diego Board of Education from 1988 to 1996. Since 2012, she has held the state Assembly seat in the 79th District in San Diego County.
 In the Legislature, Weber was a lead proponent of a ballot proposal to restore affirmative action — it was rejected by voters last month. She also authored a law, signed by Newsom in September, that creates a task force to come up with proposals for how the state could provide reparations to Black Americans, what form those reparations might take and who would be eligible to receive them.
 Weber will come to the secretary of state’s job after Padilla became recognized nationally for voting reforms and presided at a time of record voter enrollment and participation. Under his watch, the state hit 22 million registered voters.
 Also looming is a proposed recall election that could drive Newsom from office. Recall organizers say they have collected more than half the nearly 1.5 million petition signatures needed to place the recall on the ballot, and they have until mid-March to hit the required threshold.

President Donald Trump left DC on Wednesday to spend the holidays at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, a day before Congress is set to consider $2,000 stimulus checks as part of the COVID-19 relief package.
 On Tuesday night, Trump sent Washington into a frenzy when he bashed the bipartisan stimulus measure that Congress had just passed. On Wednesday afternoon, the lame duck president vetoed the defense spending bill that had passed both chambers with overwhelming support.
 It is unclear when Trump will return to Washington. As USA Today noted, an alert from the Federal Aviation Administration indicates he is expected to leave Palm Beach by 6:45 p.m. on January 1. If he stays that long, the already-passed $900 billion stimulus package could be automatically vetoed as a result of his not signing it.
 A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on whether the president intends to veto the current stimulus package.

Kennen Sie diesen Satz? Der Plan steht, Business Cases wurden gebaut, das Budget berechnet, das Projekt beginnt. Und prompt kommt die erste Abweichung. Doch diesen detaillierten Plan zu ändern, wäre ein mörderischer Aufwand. Also wird der Plan besser nicht geändert; stattdessen wird diskutiert, wie man die Realität dem schönen Plan anpassen kann. Nicht wirklich zielführend.
