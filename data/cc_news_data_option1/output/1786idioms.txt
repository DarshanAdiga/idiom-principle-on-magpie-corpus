Struck by the gap between reputation and reality, she determined to get to the bottom of history and myth. The deeper she dug into the making of the modern heartland, the wider her story became as she realized that she'd uncovered an unheralded crossroads of people, commerce, and ideas. But the really interesting thing was that over the course of American history, even as the region's connections with the rest of the planet became increasingly dense and intricate, the idea of the rural Midwest as a steadfast heartland became a stronger and more stubbornly immovable myth. In enshrining a symbolic heart, the American people have repressed the kinds of stories that Hoganson tells, of sweeping breadth and depth and soul.

Cold temperatures, strong winds, heavy rains and snow all seem to be characteristics of this year's spring season. Amidst it all, the cranberry vine is doing its thing and moving out of dormancy.


  The tender buds on the tips of the cranberry vines are vulnerable to frost so they must be watched closely. When temperatures drop to very cold levels, it is vitally important the growing cranberry buds are, just like your own plants. This risk of frost damage can last much longer into the season, sometimes as late as July, for cranberry plants than for your own yard plants.


  Cranberry bogs quite often have the coldest temperatures in the landscape. The reason is because the bogs are wide open and are the lowest lying areas of land, allowing the cold air to settle in. On clear, calm nights with no cloud cover, heat is lost from the soil and cranberry plants and radiates back to the sky. This creates a rapid temperature inversion, with the cold air settling near the surface, resulting in what is called a radiant frost or freeze event. On a cloudy night, the evaporating heat would be trapped by the clouds, keeping the surface temperature warmer. A thick cloud cover or a steady breeze are a cranberry grower's best friend on spring nights.


  Why is a frost such a big deal? Simply put, in under an hour an entire crop can be lost! Once this happens there is no way to bring the crop back and the grower suffers a significant, possibly devastating, loss. But how does a grower monitor for frost, you may ask?


  This is a done a few ways, but the majority of growers in Massachusetts subscribe to the Frost Service provided by the Frost Committee of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association, in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station in East Wareham. Each week during the frost season, the Frost Committee determines the average tolerance (the degree at which a bud can handle a certain temperature without damage) by variety of cranberry. The individual growers then adjust for their own locations, varieties and bud development. Additional tools used by growers include cell phone apps, and infrared and traditional orchard thermometers.


  Protection for the cranberry plants is provided by water. Modern bogs have irrigation systems that can provide the needed water. Have you ever been driving early in the morning and come upon a bog with sprinklers going? It is quite an iconic sight here in Southeastern Massachusetts, isn't it?


  Have you ever wondered why they are going when the sun is coming out instead of overnight? The earliest hours of dawn typically provide the coldest temperatures on the low-lying bog landscape requiring frost protection. Turning on the sprinklers can be done manually or through system automation. Many growers make use of technology, like cellphones and computers, and automation for gauging temperatures and turning pumps on and off. These systems can turn the pumps on automatically at a specific temperature and cycle off again when the temperature rises to reduce the amount of water used. As we all know, technology is not always reliable, so the many growers still opt to sit bog side in their trucks during the peak frost times to ensure their frost protection is functioning properly.


  While many people these days are experiencing sleepless nights due to the world situation, this tends to be a common occurrence during frost season for cranberry growers. Due to the temperatures the frost service started early and, despite the rainy weather, the nights have been cool. Already this spring, frost warnings have been issued more than the entire 2019 spring frost season. A night of forecasted rain usually means no frost warning will be issued, which gives the growers a night off from their diligent frost watch.


  While most of Massachusetts is longing for sustained warm, sunny spring days to finally arrive, so too are the hard working cranberry growers.

“There are going to be high-volume grand juries for several months,” said Herdman.


  Justice Department officials said investigative activity has also slowed because they have taken steps to protect personnel. Supervisors are taking more time to plan operations and using smaller groups of agents. Though agents are also being encouraged to work from home, that is not always possible. To ensure secure facilities do not get too crowded, prosecutors and agents have been assigned to staggered shifts, officials said.


  To better marshal resources at hand, Justice Department officials said they have further sharpened their focus on cases involving national security, terrorism, violent crime and exploitation of children. Except for probes into coronavirus-related frauds, such as those peddling fake medicine, white collar and related inquiries have been put on the back burner, officials said.


  “We are prioritizing cases that deal with public safety and national security,” said agent Paul D. Delacourt, the assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles Field Office. “We have postponed some operations that would have taken place, but we are not standing down operations. We want to be a reliable partner when the inevitable crisis hits, whether that is in a few weeks or later.”

Rocco Carzo IV is, by his own admission, in the best shape of his life.


   


  And he hasn't left his Blue Springs basement.


   


  Well, the former Kansas City Mavericks captain has left his basement, but when it comes to training, inspiration and hard work, Carzo's RC4 Online Virtual Training sessions continue to grow at a rate he can't believe.


   


  "I can't hit the ice, but I can go downstairs and offer online training, so that's what I'm doing," said Carzo, a leader in many Mavericks career categories who retired following the most recent abbreviated season.


   


  "You know me, I can't stand still, and when all the coronavirus quarantine stuff hit, I was wondering, 'What am I going to do without being able to go on the ice?' I had some kids lined up for one-on-one lessons and some group stuff and I needed to make some money, you know, to put food on the table."


   


  So he began brainstorming and came up with the idea of online virtual sessions.


   


  "When this started, I thought I might have a handful of campers and it would take three or four hours a week," Carzo said. "Maybe do one or two sessions a week, to just see what would happen."


   


  Well, five campers soon grew to 35, which grew to more than 100 and now, four weeks into the training sessions, he has more than 245 campers and is training them 3-7 p.m. three days a week with a personal Zoom session on Fridays.


   


  They feature his former Maverick teammates and NHL players like Pittsburgh's Conor Sheary, Carzo's roommate when they attended the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.


   


  "I like to have guys who have an inspirational story, no first-round draft picks, but guys who have a strong work ethic and have made it to the pros," Carzo said. "And the campers really enjoy their stories."


   


  When he isn't interviewing his friends in the pro ranks, Carzo is working up a sweat in his basement.


   


  "Man, I've just been working in my basement and I'm in the best shape of my life," he said, chuckling. "And the crazy thing is we have about 100 local kids, then we have kids from (my hometown of) Philadelphia, Delaware, Jersey - all over the place.


   


  "And we work hard - but I'm still just a kid at heart and I have more fun than anyone. I want kids to walk away from this saying I had fun and I learned a lot of hockey. And we're doing it all without any ice."


   


  While Carzo plans on spending the summer in Eastern Jackson County, he plans to one day move back home to Philadelphia, where he and his father, Rocco Carzo III, are going to become business partners.


   


  They purchased the skating rink where young Carzo first started skating, and it comes with a gymnasium.


   


  "It will be called the RC4 Hockey Facility and my dad is going to do the business stuff and I'm going to be doing the training and teaching," Carzo said with a touch of pride in his voice. "Everyone out here knows how much I respect and love my dad - everyone who meets him loves the guy - and I can't wait to be his business partner. And to own the rink where I started skating is like a dream come true.


   


  "We already have more than 50 teams that want to book ice time from squirts to college teams. We're going spruce up the gym, make it a place anyone would be proud to work out in, and see what happens."


   


  Carzo said he also wants to teach kids about more than just the ins and outs of hockey.


   


  "I want the kids to learn about hockey, but more importantly, I want them to learn about life," he said. "Right now, I want them to learn a work ethic and how to become better citizens.


   


  "Those are things my dad and my coaches taught me, and I want to teach kids the same things. Right now, we're doing it all virtually - and soon, we'll get back on the ice. And I can't wait for that day."


   


  There are still slots open for Carzo's RC4 Online Virtual Training sessions. Go to rc4hockey.com to get more information.

But a lot of the disconnect has to do with timing. Comic strips run in the daily newspaper, but they aren’t done the day before. They typically have deadlines up to eight weeks in advance.


  “It is a hard curveball to try to hit,” said Jerry Scott, a San Luis Obispo writer who co-produces the strips “Zits” and “Baby Blues.” “With the news cycle being what it is right now, eight weeks might as well be eight years. I hesitate trying to be too current.”


  When the novel coronavirus arrived, Scott and his collaborators (Jim Borgman with “Zits” and Rick Kirkman with “Baby Blues”) scrambled to replace strips that showed large gatherings of people. Although they weren’t addressing the pandemic head-on, they also didn’t want it to seem as if Jeremy, the high school kid in “Zits,” or the MacPherson family, in “Baby Blues,” were flouting rules aimed at stopping the spread of the virus.


  “We’re respecting the social-distancing idea and keeping everybody close to home,” Scott said. “But in the strips we’re doing now (which will run in July) we haven’t put masks on anybody because we don’t know how long those will be mandated. It seems like part of the job now is to be a bit of a fortune- teller.”

Few plants can rival the spectacular floral displays that are seen in azaleas (Rhododendron). The profusion of flowers, the vivid colors that are available, and their adaptability to different soil and climates makes them one of the most popular shrubs that we grow. It would not be springtime without azaleas, and this is especially true in the Southeast.      Most well-established neighborhoods with their large trees are the ideal cover for these lovely plants, giving them the dappled shade they need and the leaf litter and pine needles that azaleas appreciate. They have been bred for hundreds of years and there are more than 10,000 different cultivars of these lovely plants. Although most people associate azaleas with spring, some bloom in summer and fall. By carefully selecting plants, you can have azaleas blooming at least eight months of the year.      To keep these plants looking pretty and blooming their heads off, one needs to do some general maintenance after they bloom, and timing is critical if you want your azaleas to bloom next year. The best time to prune is within three to four weeks after they finish blooming in the spring. Azaleas, like other plants, need time to make the flower buds for the next year. If you wait too late to prune, you will be cutting off the flower buds for the following spring and instead of having a lovely flowering plant, you will have a green bush with few flowers, if any at all.      There are two classes of azaleas, our native azaleas and the Asian azaleas. Native azaleas are indigenous to many parts of the U.S. and they are growing in popularity. They are sometimes called wild or honeysuckle azaleas and many have a lovely fragrance. These azaleas typically do not need to be pruned because they have a more open shape. However, if you do want to prune them, it is very important to prune at the right time so that you do not miss out on flowers the following year.      On the other hand, the Asian azaleas are the evergreen ones with most of them coming from Japan. Azaleas bloom on old wood. They produce flower buds on last year's growth and for this reason, it is very important to prune immediately after they finish blooming. If you prune in summer or fall, you will be removing the flower buds. The new reblooming azaleas like Encore and Bloom-A- Thon bloom on both last year's growth and the current year's growth. They also need to be pruned in the spring, like the other evergreen azaleas.      When preparing to prune, you need a pair of hand clippers and a pair of loppers. Hand clippers work well on the smaller branches and use the loppers on branches one-half to 1 1/2 inches thick. The long handles of the loppers give you the leverage for cutting larger limbs and allows you to get inside the bush to prune.      I would not use hedge trimmers or shears on azaleas unless you want a formal look or a shaped hedge. If you do this year after year, you will still need to go deep inside from time to time and prune. If you only use hedge trimmers, over time, you will have only growth on the very top of the bush and the plants could become leggy.      In most landscapes, azaleas look best when they are pruned a little each year to let light and air get into the bush yet keep the graceful shape of the bush. This is done by going inside the bush and pruning. I have a rule that I never prune more than one-fourth to one-third of a bush in any given year. You can come back next year and prune again so the bush keeps a lovely shape.      However, if major pruning is needed, and you want to take out more than one- third of the bush, it is best to do this in the late winter. This is only needed when a bush has become overgrown and you want to make it smaller in size. You can cut a bush down to about 18 inches in height but this dramatic pruning must be done in winter when the sap is down. Of course, you will be losing blooms that spring but this way, you will save the bush and it will come back and you can work to keep it under control. I find that larger azaleas, like the Southern Indica azaleas, are the ones that need this pruning if left unpruned year after year.      People are often scared to prune and I can understand this fear. I use to be the same way. What I find is a good solution is to prune some and then go back a few days later and see what you think. You can always cut more if the shrub is still too large. Just remember not to cut more than a quarter to a third of a bush when doing spring pruning.      Recently, I pruned one bed and it looked thin in some places. Looking at that bed several days later, branches were starting to fill in where I had cut and it looked much better. Branches that were squashed had moved over to fill the holes. It makes me think that I need to go prune some more. Plants are forgiving too and they will put out new growth and hide your mistakes.

Sony is taking Apple’s Powerbeats Pro headphones head-on with its new workout-friendly wireless earbuds, the Sony WF-SP800N, that sport an 18-hour battery life (9 on board and 9 in the case) and an IP55 rating that make them water-resistant.


  That’s pretty much right on par with the Powerbeats Pro, but in addition to sharing some similarities with Apple’s sport earbuds Sony is taking things one step further by offering some basic active noise cancellation tech and support for 360 Reality Audio, the company’s proprietary spatial audio format.


  That last bit is pretty exciting because there aren't a ton of wireless headphones that support it - making these one of the first to hit the market.


  Sony says the new true wireless workout buds will cost $199 (AU$449, around £160) in four colors (Black, Blue, Red and White) first in the US starting today and around the world later this year.


  ## Another pair of true wireless earbuds?!


  If you feel like you just read about a new pair of Sony true wireless earbuds, it was more than likely the Sony WF-XB700 that were announced in April and come in at $129 (£130, around AU$200).  

  While the WF-XB700 are a bit cheaper, the SP800N have a slightly better IPX- rating for more serious athletes and basic active noise cancellation. The SP800N look a bit more sleek, too, and support 360 Reality Audio.


  If you want a simpler analogy, the WF-XB700 is to the Apple AirPods as the Sony WF-SP800N is to the Powerbeats Pro.


  We won't know how the Sony WF-SP800N stack up against the Powerbeats until we get them in our ears, but on paper at least, Sony's latest true wireless earbuds could pose a serious threat to Beats' longtime locker room dominance.

The shutdown also has necessitated his changing the duties of his staff. The district employs 43 full-time cafeteria workers in the elementary, intermediate and junior-senior high schools. They now are working to prepare the breakfasts and lunches, Bergman said, adding, "we're keeping them busy."


  Because of his demanding schedule, Bergman's day when school is in session starts around 4:30 a.m. and he works 10 to 12-hour days. In addition to overseeing the food preparations, he's busy ordering food and reading up on the regulations. The deliveries arrive early in the morning.


  The district's free breakfasts and lunches are reimbursed to the district by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Bergman makes a point to buy as much locally as he can, or at least within the region or in Pennsylvania.


  The milk comes from Marburger Dairy in Evans City, where many of the local dairy farms ship their milk. Each student gets two cartons every day.


  The apples come from the Apple Castle in Wilmington Township, "and we give out 50 bushels a week," Bergman said, adding, "It's really nice to be able to support local agriculture."


  The other produce is bought from Monteverde's of Pittsburgh, a food distribution company that gives the district the choice of buying locally, first.


  "We buy a lot of Frito Lay products that are made in Pennsylvania, and we use a ton of Heinz products," he said.


  His job also involves a lot of government paperwork and writing menus to ensure they meet nutritional standards. His full-time assistant, Ashley Maggie, helps him with all of those duties. Bergman also has a head cook and assistant cooks on staff in every building.


  "I'm fortunate. Debbie (DeBlasio) never says no when we're doing something for kids," he said. "The administration and school board have all been extremely supportive, and my staff has been dedicated.


  "And it's not without risk," he said. "The workers deserve a lot of credit for being front-line people out in the community, passing out food."


  Likewise, his efforts haven't gone unnoticed by the school board and administrators. He's treated them at special meetings to gourmet appetizer buffets and dinners.


  Bergman also has stepped up to spearhead the district's preparation, serving and packaging of free dinners to the public, three nights a week, serving 500 people at a time in partnership with Victory Family Church and other volunteers. The bagged dinners are given out at curbside from the back door of New Castle High School.


  As word of mouth has spread about those dinners, donations have poured in.


  Bergman's work with them is above and beyond his call of duty, in his free time.


  "Victory Family Church asked me to do it," he said. "We've had a pretty good partnership, and a lot of other groups are stepping up."


  When an organization or business sponsors a meal, that group's people usually show up and help with distributing it, but volunteers must be limited to 10 people, and social distancing is enforced, he said. They also must wear masks and gloves.


  Bergman coordinates all of that. He has turned away volunteers, and he prefers to schedule them if they want to help. Some dinners are brought in from local restaurants for the giveaway, but his kitchen staff still cooks some of them, too.


  "We've cooked some nice dinners," he said, mentioning a chicken Alfredo, walking tacos and baked chicken with mashed potatoes as examples.


  "We've been very blessed that we have unlimited resources," he said, emphasizing that the school district does not pay for any of the evening dinners. Rather, it's all been by community donations.


  But Bergman's main focus continues to be the hundreds of children he feeds every day from satellite distribution centers sprinkled throughout the city.


  "We're the experts on feeding kids," Bergman said. "We want to make sure we're the ones people can rely on, to make sure they're not going hungry."

Details über die betroffenen Vereine nannte er dabei nicht.In erster Testung waren bei insgesamt 1724 Untersuchungen zehn Coronafälle offenbar geworden, drei davon beim 1. FC Köln.


  Darüber hinaus wird unter den Klubs diskutiert, ob nach der Fortsetzung der Saison fünf Auswechslungen pro Team und Spiel erlaubt sein sollen. Darüber solle kurzfristig entschieden werden, sollte temporär für diese Spielzeit die Möglichkeit dazu bestehen, sagte Seifert.

The Volkswagen Group recorded a ‘substantial impact’ on its business as a result of the pandemic in the first three months of the current year (January- March).


  Deliveries to customers fell 23 per cent from the previous year to two million vehicles. Frank Witter, member of the Group Board of Management responsible for Finance and IT, said the “gradual restart”, also of factories outside of China, had begun.


  In Germany, dealers have reopened and the group has taken steps together to get the business up and running again while steering through this “unprecedented crisis with focus and determination”. VW expects deliveries to customers in 2020 to be significantly below the previous year due to the pandemic. Challenges will also arise particularly from the increasing intensity of competition, volatile commodity/foreign exchange markets and more stringent emissions-related requirements. Sales revenue of the group in 2020 is expected to be significantly below the prior year’s level as a result of Covid-19.


  Overall, the VW Group expects operating profit for 2020 to be ‘severely below’ the prior year, but still to remain positive. Despite countermeasures, the R&D ratio and the ratio of capex to sales revenue in the automotive division are expected to be above the previous year’s level in 2020 due to lower demand and therefore falling sales revenues.

After my kids left the nest, I went from cooking every night for four people to cooking every night for just my husband and myself. And when I say cooking every night, I actually mean, eating out twice a week, ordering in three times a week, and cooking twice. Actually, I'd cook only once, because the second time we'd have leftovers.      But then we all got quarantined and suddenly I was making three meals a day every day for the two of us for what felt like a year. My husband of course, didn't see anything wrong with this, while I felt like I'd become a short- order cook.      So, when my husband asked me a simple question for the ninety-fifth hundredth time, I kind of lost my mind.      "Hey honey, what's for dinner?" he said.      "Aauugghh!" I yelled and ran into the bathroom. I needed to be alone with my thoughts. There weren't many. It was mostly that I didn't want to make dinner again.      The problem wasn't so much that I had to cook. The problem was what I had to cook with. While other people had bought rolls and rolls of toilet paper for the quarantine, I had stocked up on beans. Apparently, for no reason whatsoever, I was convinced that a pandemic would lead to a shortage of beans, so I panicked and bought a dozen or so cans. But in my bean-induced confusion, I hit the wrong button and instead of ordering a few cans, I ordered a case, and when it arrived, I was the proud owner of 50 cans of beans.      Beside having nowhere to store 50 cans of beans, I had another problem. When I was ordering my beans, I failed to take into account the fact that my family has not historically done too well with beans, and there existed the very real possibility that if I served too many meals made of beans, we would probably, in no uncertain terms, blow up.      This was not something I was guessing at. This was a known fact. Having made chili before, I knew what effects the beans had on my family, and let's just say that there isn't enough Febreeze in the world to overcome what my family let loose. There was a time, once, where I was pretty sure we were to blame for a massive hole in the Earth's ozone that had formed after we had dinner on Chili night.      Then, that weekend, we took our leftovers with us when we went skiing. The next day, I swear we all skied 50% faster because of our "tailwind."      The kids, naturally, found all this hilarious. My husband and I … not so much. At some point, I tried giving everyone some of those natural digestive enzymes they sell in the store for just such a problem. It was clear they didn't help when the gas company showed up at our door after the neighbors reported smelling something noxious coming from our house.      Knowing that the beans posed a serious threat to our comfort, and quite possibly my marriage, I needed to find a way to cook them so neither of us would have a problem. I scoured the internet and discovered that soaking and rinsing the beans prior to cooking, even canned beans, would help a lot.      So, one night I tested the theory and made a batch of Black Bean Sloppy Joes. The rinsing seemed to do the trick for me and I felt no gaseous side effects after dinner. But as we sat on the couch later, I suddenly smelled something so bad it singed my nose hairs.      "Was that you?" I asked my husband as I smothered my face with a pillow.      "No," he said, pulling his shirt up over his nose. "You?"      I shook my head. We both looked down at the dog asleep on the floor.   "Hmmm," I said. "Guess I won't be putting any more beans in his food."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.

Confirmation that the planned medical school at Magee is to be taken forward by the Executive Office has been welcomed by local Sinn Féin MLA Karen Mullan.


  Karen Mullan commented:


  “The medical school at Magee has long been recognised as a pivotal project, not just in terms of the expansion of Magee University but the overall economic regeneration of Derry, Strabane and the wider North West.


  “But it has faced a number of delays and difficulties.


  ”In this context I welcome the decision of the Executive today that this project will now be taken forward by the joint heads of government. The medical school is a complex and cross-departmental scheme and by moving it to the Executive Office, the difficulties can be addressed in time for the first intake of postgraduate students next year.


  “This is a welcome move which comes on the back of the extremely positive Executive intervention committing record levels of investment to this region. The agreement to match fund the City Deal and Future Fund means that we now have a £210 million package that will be pivotal to our economic and social regeneration.


  “Achieving this at a time of global crisis when all governments are facing huge challenges, is an important recognition that investment must address regional imbalance and the legacy of past neglect.


  “That is something which Sinn Féin Finance Minister Conor Murphy has been abundantly clear on and I thank him for the commitment he has shown to redressing regional inequality.


  “Progress on the medical school is critical to opening up a new chapter for third-level education in Derry which will see the much-needed NHS heroes of the future being trained and retained in this city. I look forward to that vision being realised.”

In April, Ciarrocca explained the difficulties brought forth from the reconfigured spring.


  “It’s been just a little bit more challenging,” Ciarrocca said last month. “As far as recruiting goes, everybody is dealing with the same thing. I don’t see it being an advantage or a disadvantage for anybody. It would be great if I could get out and watch the quarterbacks throw. It’s great when kids can come on campus and we can spend time interacting with them in person and getting a feel for them and whether or not they’re the right people for your program.”


  Last week, Ciarocca landed his first quarterback at Penn State when class of 2021 four-star Bullis School (Potomac, Md.) signal-caller Christian Veilleux pledged his verbal commitment.


  Trautwein snagged his first verbal as a Penn State coach in March when class of 2021 four-star Good Counsel (Olney, Md.) offensive lineman Landon Tengwall gave his verbal. Penn State tight ends coach Tyler Bowen also helped with Tengwall’s recruitment.


  Scott got on board when class of 2021 three-star defensive end Rodney McGraw (Elkhart, Ind.) flipped his verbal commitment to Penn State from Indiana. Penn State safeties coach Tim Banks also helped with McGraw’s recruitment.


  “I’ve been proud of how the staff has handled it,” Franklin said Penn State’s recruiting efforts. “Obviously, it’s been a huge adjustment for the new guys because this hasn’t been the normal transition for them. Guys like Taylor and (Trautwein) and coach Scott, it’s been a big adjustment like it always is, but this has made it a little more complicated.”


  Eleven class of 2021 members have given their verbal commitment to play for Penn State.


  The methods the Nittany Lions have used this spring have been unconventional, but the results have been successful. While the program will receive a boost with each player’s commitment, Franklin said at the end of the day, they must ultimately feel confident in their decision to commit early and the impact it will have on their future as a student and as an athlete.


  “So far, it’s been received well,” Franklin said. “We’re not in the pressuring recruits business. That’s not how we go about our business. But we also want to make sure when these young men, if they want to commit and they want to jump on board, we don’t want them to be doing it because of the current situation. We want them to be doing it because they feel great about Penn State, and they think it’s the right fit for their families and their futures.”

Cold temperatures, strong winds, heavy rains and snow all seem to be characteristics of this year's spring season. Amidst it all, the cranberry vine is doing its thing and moving out of dormancy.


  The tender buds on the tips of the cranberry vines are vulnerable to frost so they must be watched closely. When temperatures drop to very cold levels, it is vitally important the growing cranberry buds are, just like your own plants. This risk of frost damage can last much longer into the season, sometimes as late as July, for cranberry plants than for your own yard plants.


  Cranberry bogs quite often have the coldest temperatures in the landscape. The reason is because the bogs are wide open and are the lowest lying areas of land, allowing the cold air to settle in. On clear, calm nights with no cloud cover, heat is lost from the soil and cranberry plants and radiates back to the sky. This creates a rapid temperature inversion, with the cold air settling near the surface, resulting in what is called a radiant frost or freeze event. On a cloudy night, the evaporating heat would be trapped by the clouds, keeping the surface temperature warmer. A thick cloud cover or a steady breeze are a cranberry grower's best friend on spring nights.


  Why is a frost such a big deal? Simply put, in under an hour an entire crop can be lost! Once this happens there is no way to bring the crop back and the grower suffers a significant, possibly devastating, loss. But how does a grower monitor for frost, you may ask?


  This is a done a few ways, but the majority of growers in Massachusetts subscribe to the Frost Service provided by the Frost Committee of the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers' Association, in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station in East Wareham. Each week during the frost season, the Frost Committee determines the average tolerance (the degree at which a bud can handle a certain temperature without damage) by variety of cranberry. The individual growers then adjust for their own locations, varieties and bud development. Additional tools used by growers include cell phone apps, and infrared and traditional orchard thermometers.


  Protection for the cranberry plants is provided by water. Modern bogs have irrigation systems that can provide the needed water. Have you ever been driving early in the morning and come upon a bog with sprinklers going? It is quite an iconic sight here in Southeastern Massachusetts, isn't it?


  Have you ever wondered why they are going when the sun is coming out instead of overnight? The earliest hours of dawn typically provide the coldest temperatures on the low-lying bog landscape requiring frost protection. Turning on the sprinklers can be done manually or through system automation. Many growers make use of technology, like cellphones and computers, and automation for gauging temperatures and turning pumps on and off. These systems can turn the pumps on automatically at a specific temperature and cycle off again when the temperature rises to reduce the amount of water used. As we all know, technology is not always reliable, so the many growers still opt to sit bog side in their trucks during the peak frost times to ensure their frost protection is functioning properly.


  While many people these days are experiencing sleepless nights due to the world situation, this tends to be a common occurrence during frost season for cranberry growers. Due to the temperatures the frost service started early and, despite the rainy weather, the nights have been cool. Already this spring, frost warnings have been issued more than the entire 2019 spring frost season. A night of forecasted rain usually means no frost warning will be issued, which gives the growers a night off from their diligent frost watch.


  While most of Massachusetts is longing for sustained warm, sunny spring days to finally arrive, so too are the hard working cranberry growers.

Depending on point of view last week's meeting of the board of Triumph Gulf Coast, Inc. was a mixed bag.
   
 For Gulf Coast State College, and its Gulf/Franklin Campus, it was a fruitful day with two projects that would be located in Gulf County moved ahead in the pipeline by the Triumph board.
   
 As for the Board of County Commissioners, there was no discussion on the county's lobbying efforts to have the Triumph board immediately disburse this year's dollar pledge to each of the eight counties under Triumph.
   
 The concept was brought to the table by staff during a special meeting of Triumph earlier this month, but not during last week's meeting.
   
 The county wants to establish a grant/loan program for local small businesses to assist in mitigating losses incurred during the current pandemic.
   
 "They have a lot of money in the bank and it is time for us to demand our money," said County Administrator Michael Hammond. "We want to do something now, not later."
   
 The county is pledged roughly $3.4 million this year from the roughly $1.5 billion in Deepwater Horizon fine dollars the Triumph board is legislatively- charged with disbursing over the next 16-17 years.
   
 Hammond acknowledged the county had benefited from project grants on the education side, to the public schools and GCSC.
   
 However, beyond the money received after Hurricane Michael to offset property tax losses, which was not intended to come from the county's pledge of the pot, whether any other Gulf project had actually received the check.
   
 "That Triumph money, that is our money and we want it," said Commissioner Ward McDaniel.
   
 While there was frustration in the BOCC's meeting room there was some elation at GCSC and the Gulf County campus.
   
 The Triumph board voted unanimously to move ahead with grant parameters, or a term sheet, on what the college is calling "a boot camp for exiting military" in unmanned aerial systems, i.e. drones.
   
 The boot camp, a nearly $4 million project with the college and partners providing a $1.7 match to Triumph's $2.2 million grant, is focused at providing existing military veterans in the eight impacted counties the opportunity to earn as many as eight certifications in piloting unmanned aircraft.
   
 In 16 weeks, an individual could receive all the certifications of "outside of line of sight flying," said Frank Fuller, Triumph's education consultant.
   
 The region, he added, could see a 12 percent growth in operations from companies such as FedEx and Amazon.
   
 "They are clamoring for unmanned aerial systems," Fuller said. "It reduces contact and reduces costs."
   
 GCSC President John Holdnak said the college had a unique position for such a program, geographically and with partnerships and building infrastructure.
   
 "We look forward to working with a variety of private stakeholders to make Gulf County the epicenter for unmanned aerial systems," Holdnak said.
   
 That would continue under another project the Triumph board approved in concept, approving staff's recommendation that the project move forward.
   
 The project would create, with Skyborne Technology as a partner, a regional technical center for disaster relief.
   
 The project would, in very short strokes, employ the manned and unmanned systems being developed by Skyborne, with trained personnel, after a natural disaster.
   
 Essentially, a deployed tethered "mothership" which is currently near completion at Skyborne's Wewahitchka facility, with drones attached can provide satellite phone and search capabilities after natural disasters.
   
 Much of the technology Skyborne owns outright; the company, through its tethered airship and technology, is providing a $2.7 million match for the grant.
   
 In addition, the goals of the project are to demonstrate the capabilities of the communications equipment; provide training to local and regional emergency operations centers; ensure the deployment of equipment and workforce at the direction of FEMA; promote research and develop agreements to use the systems and technology in support of security for large events, such as a concert.
   
 The total project carries a price tag of $9.9 million; the college is seeking just over $5 million from Triumph.
   
 "We feel very strongly about (the project)," Holdnak said. "Eighteen months ago we lived through the aftermath of Hurricane Michael."
   
 Holdnak added that the college worked well with two different EOCs in Bay and Gulf counties, "there were gaps/"
   
 "This is an effort from our hearts and our brains to help the region."

Bergman, the district's food service director, makes sure that no child goes hungry, and he's carrying out that mission, especially during these times of COVID-19, financial hardship and uncertainty.


  "He's a superhero in my eyes," superintendent Debbie DeBlasio said.


  He makes sure he gives the students fresh, locally produced and cooked-from- scratch food whenever possible, and he has stepped up to convert cafeteria meals into thousands of packaged, take-home meals for the students since school closed on March 16.


  Bergman has been feeding the district students for three years. When the coronavirus threat shut down all of the schools, not a day was wasted before he, the administrators and his staff had free breakfasts and lunches planned and rolled out to the city streets for them to take home for free.


  "We met March 14 in my office and I told him my vision, and he took it and never looked back," DeBlasio said.


  Bergman sat at a dimly lit cafeteria table, his mouth and nose covered by a fabric mask decorated with a pizza and garlic pattern, taking one of the few sit-down breaks he's had since the epidemic started. Behind him were tables topped with dozens of lime green fiber bags waiting to be filled with breakfasts and lunches for the district students this week.


  "It was all very much a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants, that first week," Bergman reflected, "but we had food out to the kids that first day."


  He worked together with DeBlasio and business manager Joe Ambrosini throughout that weekend, "talking about how we would make sure the kids in our district are fed. It's important to (DeBlasio) to reach as many kids as possible."


  Bergman is a graduate of Indiana University of Pennsylvania's Culinary Arts school in Punxsutawney. He worked at Hidden Valley Ski Resort in Somerset County as a banquet chef before taking a position at the Metz Culinary Management in Dallas, Pennsylvania, one of the largest food service suppliers in the state. He left there for New Castle in January 2017, wanting to work for the school district.


  Bergman's wife, Lauren, is a Success for All reading tutor for the district, and their family lives on the city's North Hill.


  He has made gradual changes in the school breakfast and lunch program, swapping out prepackaged food for fresh, more nutritional foods.


  One of the more significant changes he's made, while school was in session, was to start preparing all of the food fresh on site at the Lockley Early Learning Center. Previously, the grade-schoolers' breakfasts and lunches were transported there from the George Washington Intermediate School cafeteria.


  "At one time, George Washington fed eight schools," he said.


  Bergman also changed the cafeteria menu, introducing healthy foods that students like. His "walking tacos," and chicken with waffles have both become favorites, he said. He also has come up ideas for different combo plates such as yogurt, a piece of cheese and whole grain crackers packaged similar to Kraft Heinz "Lunchables."


  "Kids love the yogurt and cheese sticks," he said. "We're trying to develop more things that mimic 'Lunchables.'"


  For breakfast, Bergman's staff creates breakfast sandwiches.


  "We buy bagels, toast them, and we cook the sausage and eggs. They are all homemade and hand-wrapped."


  For any recipes he makes that call for ground beef — such as hamburgers or Sloppy Joes — he uses only fresh ground beef. The cafeteria workers make all of the pizzas from scratch, and they grill fresh burgers every day.


  One meal he is serving this week to the students is pasta with meat sauce, with a steamed vegetable and a baked cinnamon apple on a oven-friendly tray. He has a vision of buying a machine to vacuum seal the dinners so they can be included in the district's backpack program, given to the students for weekends.


  Bergman has started a "Go Fund Me" page, accessible for donations through the New Castle Area School District's food service site, to raise money for the equipment.


  Since the COVID-19 shutdown, Bergman's staff has gone from serving breakfasts and lunches at four schools to packaging and taking them to 13 distribution sites located throughout the school district. The locations are in the areas where the biggest concentrations of children live, he said.

PEMBROKE -- Charlie's Too Restaurant in Pembroke is a South Shore seafood staple, but co-owners Peter Housos and Jim Spinale say they wouldn't have been able to stick around this long if it weren't for the continued support they've received from their community, especially in this time of crisis.


  The restaurant goes all the way back to 1959 when Charlie's Snack House opened on the beach in Brant Rock in Marshfield, Housos said. The restaurant did well, which lead the owner, who was, in fact, named Charlie, to open a second location in Pembroke in the early 1990s.


  Soon after opening the new restaurant, Housos said, a storm greatly damaged the original restaurant beyond repair, and the owners were left with Charlie's Too in Pembroke.


  In 2006, after decades working the restaurant industry in Boston, Housos and Spinale began looking for a place near where they lived in Norwell. They found Charlie's Too was selling, and decided to go for it, cooking and operating it all by themselves.

  "It was basically a clam shack, but we brought our own vision," Spinale said.


  The pair made cosmetic improvements, like putting in a bar and redecorating. But they also added some specialty dishes, like a seafood stew, their own unique chili, lobster bisque and old school clam chowder. Housos and Spinale said they take great pride in their food.


  "If I wouldn't eat it, I wouldn't serve it. That's how I look at," Housos said.


  In 2012, the pair was offered the building and bought it, which was a big step for them. Housos said it's been wonderful to work for themselves and own their own place, and that they've received a lot in return.


  "We've been rewarded with incredible staff and great, devoted clientele," he said. "We're the fortunate ones."


  Even though they were new management, Housos and Spinale said they've kept a strong connection to the South Shore community all these years, still seeing customers who remember going to the original restaurant on the beach.


  But like all other restaurants, Charlie's Too couldn't escape the hardship caused by the coronavirus outbreak. Housos and Spinale said it caused them to have to completely change the way they operate.


  "Things change on a daily basis, so you don't know what's going to happen one day to the next," Housos said. "You have to be able to adjust on the fly."


  Charlie's Too began by offering a limited menu, changing the number of days they were open and operating hours, but the challenges went beyond that. They had to figure out how to do everything with masks on, how to make orders entirely takeout, get used to doing every payment by card over the phone, how to do curbside pick up and manage the huge influx of calls.


  "This isn't takeout as normal, this is takeout COVID-19," Spinale said.


  The restaurant was also approved for a federal small business loan, but was one of thousands of businesses that did not receive the money because it ran out so quickly. They may still receive the money with the new stimulus package, but even so, in response, they posted on Facebook on April 18 to vent their frustration and let customers know what was going on.


  "I've heard all my life how small businesses are the 'bread & butter' to this country - I'm not feeling it!" Housos wrote.


  To their surprise, Housos and Spinale said the response to the post was hugely supportive. The next few days, business boomed, and customers went out of their way to show their love.


  "I think it just resonated. I think people really wanted to rally and it was actually very uplifting and energizing to know that we had that kind of support," Housos said. "It really gave us that extra fuel to keep moving on."


  Now, they said, they just take it day by day, and stay grateful for what they have.


  "There were 500 people who offered words of encouragement, but there was also dozens of people that posted that they're in the same situation that we're in," Housos said. "If anything, I learned from that post that we're not alone. There's a lot of people worse off than we are. At least we're open and we've got some business coming in."

LEXINGTON, S.C. (WIS) - The Town of Lexington is taking extra steps to support small businesses facing hardships during the coronavirus pandemic. Monday, May 4, council approved an ordinance offering local business owners some financial help, and also encouraging people in the community to get out and support small businesses.There are several components to this new ordinance. This includes making $1 million in small business loans available.Town of Lexington Mayor Steve MacDougall says these will be four- year loans of up to $20,000. The application process will begin next week, with funding available within the next two weeks.“We’ve always been the town that kind of pulls ourselves up by our own bootstraps. So, we’re going to do that. We are financially very strong. So, we have an opportunity to give back to those businesses that helped put us in that position. In this whole program, we did a property tax reduction as well. I don’t know that you’re going to see anyone across America give a tax reduction during this global pandemic, but we did,” said Mayor MacDougall.The Town of Lexington cut property taxes by 21%.Another part of the ordinance provides $250,000 for a rebate program. The town is matching residents dollar-for-dollar when they support small businesses. After shopping locally, just send in your receipts for a rebate of up to $25 on your water/sewer bill.While Mayor MacDougall is encouraging people to support small businesses, he says it’s also important to continue adhering to social distancing guidelines.The mayor says, “That’s going to come on the shoulders of the small businesses. They’re going to have to do the right thing and they’re going to have to use some common sense in creating space for their customers and making sure that they stay safe distances away and they do the right thing in having hand sanitizer and cleaning their stores and making sure the handles of the doors are clean and things like that.”The rebate program is already underway. You can email your receipts, or send them in with your bill payment. The receipt will need to be dated on or after May 5, and sent in or postmarked by June 30.Receipts can be emailed to Rebate@lexsc.com or mailed to Town of Lexington, Rebate, PO Box 397, Lexington, SC 29071 and need to include a name, service address and phone number.For more information, click here.
