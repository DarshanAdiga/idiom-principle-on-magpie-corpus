Sansad Marg is also home to people who came here only because they had nowhere else to go. Dinesh Giri, who suffers from leprosy, lives here near a public toilet with his wife Maya Devi. The couple had come to Delhi to seek treatment for Maya, who was diagnosed with tuberculosis, at a government hospital.

Among them is a woman from Andhra Pradesh who began her protest after her daughter was raped, a man who claims to have been fasting for global peace right here for the past 23 years, a Kerala woman whose sister was murdered.

"Ilaaj to theek ho gaya lekin hum idhar fas gaye, bauji. Hum dono hi zyaada chal fir nahi sakte. Khaane to taras rahe hain (The treatment went well but we got stuck here. We're not in a condition to move around much. We're pining for a morsel)," he says.

Over time, this street became home to the boy. His most vivid memories are of participating in 'Anna ka dharna' and in the protest against 'Damini rape case'. In the meanwhile, Khan got a job as a construction labourer in Gurgaon and from his wages he was able to put the child in a government school and get food on the table.

Lately, he has also added the CAA and NRC to the list of issues he stands against.

There is also a man who claims to have been on a hunger strike for the past 23 years. He introduces himself as Dr Ramaindra Kumar. "I used to be the assistant professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Hindi department," he says.

But after the lockdown, his contractor — who owed him Rs 30,000 — went untraceable. "Jo bacha tha kha liya. Ab kuch nahi hai khane ke liye. (Whatever money I had has already been spent on food. Now there's nothing to eat.)"

"The MLA's goons threatened to kill us after my sister went public demanding justice. They beat me up and would have killed the boy as well. To escape the threats we took some money and came to Delhi in 2005. Right here my sister sat since then with this boy who was five years old then, till she died of brain hemorrhage in 2016," Khan says.
