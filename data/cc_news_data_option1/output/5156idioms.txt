CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) — A man who allegedly drove the wrong way on a freeway in Chandler was found asleep in his vehicle before being arrested Tuesday, authorities said. Arizona Department of Public Safety officials said 39-year-old Jorge Dominguez of Tucson was spotted going the wrong way on Interstate 10 around 2 a.m. Tuesday. They said Dominguez pulled his vehicle onto the shoulder of the freeway and a Gila River police officer found him asleep at the wheel. DPS officials said it was determined that Dominguez showed signs of impairment and he was booked into a Maricopa County jail on suspicion of aggravated DUI. It was unclear Tuesday afternoon if Dominguez has a lawyer yet.

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Minnesota’s pardon board will consider freeing a Black man who was imprisoned for life as a teenager in the 2002 death of a girl who was hit by a stray bullet while doing homework at her dining room table. Earlier this year, The Associated Press and American Public Media uncovered new evidence and serious flaws in the police investigation. Those findings raised questions about whether Myon Burrell may have been wrongfully convicted. Last week, an independent panel of national legal experts who reviewed the case said he should be released immediately, given his age at the time of the crime and the overly harsh sentence.

“The primary concerns related to risk in schools, particularly as we look at the possibility of entering Stage 5, are extracurricular activities, by and large,” said Dr. Escott. “That is where we're seeing disease spread – extracurricular activities on campus, as well as when those student athletes, dance teams, cheerleaders are sitting outside of the school environment in private gyms.”

BERLIN -- Time is running out to submit nominations for the Split the Ticket Fund and give a Vermonter the opportunity to receive help with heating their home this winter.
 Split the Ticket Fund, a Vermont-based 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, is a way for families to obtain free deliveries of heating oil, propane, or kerosene, especially those families that don’t qualify for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Half of the delivery’s cost is paid for by the fund -- through generous donations from the public -- while the other half is offset as a direct donation by the fuel provider.
 This year, the program is also helping state residents repair or replace fuel tanks in order to comply with Vermont’s aboveground storage tank regulations. The Split the Ticket Fund will provide the same 50 percent match -- up to $500 -- with heating service providers that donate labor and materials.
 Those who receive a gift of warmth are nominated by someone else from the community. To make a nomination, simply send an email to split@vermontfuel.com by Dec. 18 to let the program know about them.
 Financial donations are also being accepted with every $1 that's donated essentially being able to purchase $2 worth of fuel. To make a donation, visit vermontfuel.com/split/.
 Going into this year, Split the Ticket Fund has delivered more than 100,000 gallons of free heating fuel to Vermonters in need.
 Congressman Peter Welch, who has personally delivered nearly 1,000 of these gallons over the past decade, praised the Split the Ticket program by saying, “It is good to know that Vermonters look out for each other during our challenging winters, especially this year. I wish I could hop in the truck to lend a hand and look forward to doing so in the future."
