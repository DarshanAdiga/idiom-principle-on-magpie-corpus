 # Saugus Tree Lighting canceled, Christmas Eve Parade still on
 Mike Gaffney
 Wicked Local
 The annual Tree Lighting has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but plans are still in the works for the Christmas Eve Parade led by Santa and friends, Town Manager Scott Crabtree announced.
 Crabtree cited the surge in COVID-19 cases as the factor behind the decision to call off the Tree Lighting, which has historically been scheduled the first Friday in December on the Town Hall grounds.
 As of Tuesday, Saugus had 1,080 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 45 deaths from people who contracted the virus. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health’s latest data shows Saugus with an average daily incidence rate of 35.4 COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people over the last 14 days.
 Crabtree said he didn’t want to run the risk of a lot of residents coming down to the Tree Lighting and potentially spreading the virus to others.
 “It’s sad, this is an event people have grown up with, hopefully we can make up for it in the new year,” Crabtree said.
 In recent years, the Tree Lighting has been highlighted by Santa arriving on horse-drawn “sleigh” right before the holiday lights around Saugus Center are turned on. A petting zoo, train rides, bouncy houses, photos with Santa and lots of free munchies are among the draws that entice hundreds of people to stop by for some holiday cheer.
 On the good news front, Crabtree said it looks like the Christmas Eve Parade that dates back decades in town will proceed.
 Organizers are working to make the Christmas Eve Parade as safe as possible for those who take part in the popular annual tradition. A route will be narrowed down and that information will be shared with the community, Crabtree said.

CHICAGO (WLS) - One 72-year-old man in Illinois is finally out of the hospital after an eight-month battle with coronavirus.“It has changed me completely,” Mike Margelewski said. “I mean, I can’t do anything like I could before.”Mike Margelewski was taken by ambulance back to his home this week. He had been in and out of hospitals and rehab facilities since April.During his battle, the father, husband, and longtime city of Chicago employee was in a medically induced coma and was on a ventilator twice.“The first couple of days, it wasn’t too bad, and then it was like somebody just turned out the lights. I don’t remember nothing,” Mike Margelewski said.His wife Pam Margelewski was at his side and was his advocate when the prognosis was grim.“He went into acute respiratory failure twice and even coded. For a while, all of his organs were not doing very well. Everything was shutting down and it was all from COVID,” Pam Margelewski said.After months of fighting for his life, Mike Margelewski has a message for people who still said COVID-19 just isn’t that bad.“Just take a look at me and you will find out that it is real,” he said.His family is asking for people to take the virus seriously.“You don’t believe it? Come over here, come look at this 72-year-old man, who by the way only had high blood pressure when he went to the hospital,” Pam Margelewski said.Mike Margelewski isn’t fully out of the woods yet. He still has to go through rehab and dialysis from home.Copyright 2020 WLS via CNN Newsource. All rights reserved.

 Capably filmed by billionaire producer turned director Dan Friedkin, making his feature debut, “Vermeer” chews on some decent food for thought: most notably the idea of moral ambiguity and the compromises one sometimes makes in wartime to survive. It’s only in the film’s final half-hour when “Vermeer” turns into a more conventional courtroom drama — one whose facts are unnecessarily juiced up for the screen by writers John Orloff, James McGee, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, loosely adapting Jonathan Lopez’s book “The Man Who Made Vermeers.”

Quarantine has meant a lot of things for many different people but for Bob Huggins it’s just meant more of the same. Just in a different way.
 The West Virginia basketball head coach had been active with virtual clinic for different organizations prior to the start of his own team’s pre-season practice. He also serves on several different committees which has taken up a bulk of his time.
 “It really does keep you busy,” he said.
 Once practice began, Huggins has been obviously tied up with that but has put his faith in his assistant coaches to handle a lot of the workload. That has slid him into more of an administrator role atop the program while handling his responsibilities as the head of the team.
 Huggins also has been active on the recruiting trail, placing a lot of emphasis on virtual visits since programs won’t be able to host prospects due to the ongoing recruiting dead period. That has been an adjustment in itself, considering he is very much aligned with the old school style of thinking.
 That means sitting down and interacting face-to-face, which currently can’t happen.
 “This virtual thing I think for the time being is good, but I hope it doesn’t become a fixture in what we do,” Huggins said.
 It’s been a difficult balance as coaches have been forced to make decisions on guys and prospects on the schools without ever stepping foot on campus in some instances. That is even harder for a coach like Huggins who values those in- person evaluations over everything else.
 West Virginia still has work to do in the 2021 class to round things out, but also is getting a head start on the 2022 effort through the virtual visits and tours of the campus. Those have been effective in being able to showcase everything that the program can offer.
 “They’re kind of neat. You do get to see campus and everything that we have here for student athletes,” Huggins said.
 So while some have bogged down due to the current landscape, Huggins has been as busy as ever. And he doesn’t anticipate that changing with the season now right around the corner.

Signed by the Sydney Thunder amid a global health pandemic, the rising star was forced to quarantine in a biosecurity bubble at Sydney Olympic Park with her teammates last month. The sacrifice paid dividends, however, when Learoyd was named in the starting XI for the Thunder’s opening fixture against the Sydney Sixers at North Sydney Oval. But in a cruel twist of fate, Sydney’s unpredictable weather ensured her professional debut ended as an uneventful washout. Because the toss had already taken place, the result was a “no result” rather than “abandoned”, even though a ball had not been bowled. Learoyd got another opportunity in the Thunder’s second fixture, against the Melbourne Stars at the same venue. Once again, rain intervened, and the match came to a close after just four overs. Watch the last round of WBBL before the finals Live &amp; On-Demand on Kayo. New to Kayo? Get your free trial now &amp; start streaming instantly &gt; Learoyd unfortunately has not been selected in the starting XI of a WBBL game since, so her professional record stands at two games, zero balls bowled, zero balls faced. “It was a little bit devastating,” Learoyd told news.com.au. “I was obviously really excited to be in the 11, and for it to be rained out was a bit devastating. “But it was also devastating from a team point of view. We were really hoping to get on the park that weekend, so to not be able to do either of those things was quite disappointing.” After two washouts, the Thunder were thankfully able to string together a few wins to put them in contention for a spot in the semi-finals. And the final stretch has been particularly brutal for the eight WBBL clubs, with each team required to play six games in nine days to complete the group stage. “It’s a lot of cricket,” Learoyd said. “For us, we’ve just made sure that we’re doing what we can to recover well, recover quickly and rest as much as we can. “It’s going to be quite hectic, and it can get a little bit frantic at times, and almost a little flustered. “We’ve just got to try and be as prepared as we can off the field.” Growing up in Coffs Harbour, Learoyd found herself playing cricket whenever she could, whether that be in the backyard or on the beach. Other sports caught her attention, but nothing came close to the thrills of competitive cricket. She slowly made her way through the pathways program before securing a two-year contract with the New South Wales Breakers and Sydney Thunder earlier this year. The young gun also moved out of home in June, migrating to Sydney to help with study and cricket. She no longer has to travel six hours each way to play grade cricket on her weekends. “It was brutal,” she sighed. Unlike many Australians, Learoyd was home-schooled throughout her childhood, which assisted her chaotic sporting schedule. “Lots of people often ask me, ‘Is it better than school?’ I don’t actually know, because I never even went to school, so I can’t actually compare at all,” Learoyd said. “For me, it worked, especially with my heavy training program and playing program and all the travelling that I had to do. “My learning could be flexible around my training if needs be, whereas for most people, it would be the other way around.” Learoyd’s family live on a 22-acre property on the north coast of New South Wales, an ex-dairy farm which was essentially an abandoned paddock when they first moved in. But with the guidance of Anika’s father, the family were able to transform the property into a thriving wildlife sanctuary. “We’ve actually planted 3000 native trees,” Learoyd said. “Now we have an abundance of birds, kangaroos, turtles. “You name it, we’ve got it.” Learoyd is currently studying wildlife science at university, hoping to get into the field of wildlife conservation and management. A proud Gumbaynggirr woman, Learoyd was not aware of her Indigenous heritage until her early teens, the topic bizarrely brought up in casual conversation. Since then, Anika and her family have actively tried to find out more about their culture. “My mum is actually in the process of doing a lot more research right now,” Learoyd said. “She’s trying to put together a family tree with the help of a couple of relatives who she hasn’t spoken to for a while. “If we could get that up and running, that would definitely shed a bit more light.” During NAIDOC Week, several WBBL players took part in a Barefoot Circle to celebrate the Indigenous culture and acknowledge the traditional owners of the land. “It’s actually been an amazing week,” Learoyd said. “I’d never really done too much with NAIDOC Week before. “It’s been big at schools, but again, I didn’t go to school. “The WBBL has done a lot towards it. To be able to do that and educate a couple of the players and teams was really cool.” Learoyd is one of five Indigenous players in the WBBL, a quintet led by World Cup champion Ash Gardner. The Sydney Sixers all-rounder has established herself as one of the most formidable players in the women’s game, and her influence extends beyond the boundary. Gardner recently established her own foundation, which aims to encourage schooling and reduce incarceration numbers among Indigenous youth. Before joining the Australian squad in 2017, Gardner competed in the National Indigenous Cricket Championships alongside Learoyd. “I was able to see the impact she was having,” Learoyd said. “There was all this media about Ash and what she was doing for the Indigenous culture, and I thought that was really cool, and really inspiring. “To be able to come back to a sport where I’m meeting up with Ash again, and we’re doing out bit to try and inspire the next generation and give a bit of an education and give people a bit more knowledge surrounding their Indigenous culture.” With two games remaining in the regular season, the Thunder are desperate to rediscover some momentum leading into the finals series at North Sydney Oval. There are still six teams in contention for the semi-finals, but only four can qualify beyond this weekend. “We’re just really looking to hopefully pick up back to where we were at the start of the tournament,” Learoyd said. “We would really love to be able to do that, especially for our fans, because they’ve been unreal coming out to support us for any game that they can. “If we can get the results on the board that we’d like to, I know that would make a lot of people happy, including ourselves.”

 OLD COLONY MEMORIAL
 # Canadian finches flock to Myles Standish State Forest
 Dave Kindy
 Wicked Local
 While international tourism may be down in Plymouth because of the pandemic, there has been a bump in foreign guests at Myles Standish State Forest. Broods of hungry Canadian visitors flew in to enjoy the spacious 12,000-acre park and its ample food reserves this summer and fall.
 Flocks of finches from north of the border are here looking for grub and grubs. A decline in nuts and berries in Canada brought on by cyclical growth patterns caused tens of thousands of birds to seek sustenance elsewhere, including in Eastern Massachusetts.
 “Last year, they had a huge volume of seed, which led the birds to overpopulate,” said Charlie Pye, a volunteer with the Friends of Myles Standish State Forest. “This year, there’s very little in the arboreal forests of northern and western Canada, which caused many birds to flee here.”
 That’s a boon for birdwatchers at the state forest and even at backyard feeders. Finches of all shapes and sizes – some not usually seen in this neck of the woods – are now searching for food.
 Evening grosbeaks, pine grosbeaks, pine siskins, common redpolls, red crossbills and red breasted nuthatches are just a few of the finch species that have flown into town and will likely stay here for the winter. Food supplies here are adequate to satisfy the increased populations, according to Austin Mason, a retired forester who worked at Myles Standish.
 “There’s plenty of food around right now,” he said. “Nuts, berries and pitch pine cones, which the crossbills love, are abundant. That’s why they are showing up here. Some will stay for the winter and some will go south, but right now we have lots of birds.”
 Mason noted that evening grosbeaks are numerous at the moment. The species used to populate the area but moved away because of because of climate change and reduced habitat.
 “They’re back now,” he said. “We’ve had the strongest outbreak here in more than 40 years.”
 A growing cycle known as mast year, along with drought conditions and other factors, have caused many birds to fly this way from Canada. According to Pye, trees and shrubs can produce a bumper crop of nuts and seeds, which causes bird populations to increase. The next year, though, food production returns to normal or below-normal conditions, causing many birds to take wing. These cycles can occur every five to 10 years.
 “It’s called synchronate,” he said. “It’s how the forest manages itself and ensures survival for trees and shrubs. It forces many of the bird species to fly elsewhere, like here.”
 In addition to finches, other common and not-so common birds are turning up in the area. Sightings of blue jays and snowy owls are on the rise, as are reports of other wandering species, such as the western kingbird, ash-throated flycatcher and even the Eurasian cuckoo.
 “That’s the one you see in the cuckoo clock,” Mason said. “They are very rare around here, but one was just spotted in Rhode Island.”
 So grab your binoculars and take to the woods. According to Mason and Pye, there are plenty of new and different birds to view this fall.
 “As long as they have food, they will stick around,” Pye said. “If you want to attract them to your yard, make sure you have plenty of black sunflower and thistle seed in your feeders.”

El primer motivo para volver a descartarla es que el movimiento social local ha manifestado su oposicion radical a una norma pensada mas como instrumento de represion que de fomento de la ciudadania; en democracia, un rechazo cuantitativa y cualitativamente tan notable convierte esa norma en, como poco, inoportuna. El segundo motivo es que el texto de la ordenanza se parece muy poco a lo que el equipo de gobierno dice que es. Habla de medidas de reinsercion y solo propone sanciones, multas y represion.

Christian Academy Schools have installed new air purification systems at the English Station campus in Louisville and New Albany, Indiana campus to create a healthier and safer environment.LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE)- When the Christian Academy School System brought back all in-person classes, the system enforced wearing masks during school. Now the school system has taken another step to keep students and staff safe inside school walls. Christian Academy Schools have installed new air purification systems at the English Station and New Albany campuses to create a healthier and safer environment. PurGenix created the aluminum fins which CEO Samuel Perkins said it eliminates different pathogens. According to Perkins, any air supply will take in air then shower out germs. He said the purification system acts as a plug and blocks the shower.Perkins said he started this mission 12 years ago and problems with air quality always existed. It’s at the front the publics' mind now because of COVID-19.“This is the dream that I had of helping people,” Perkins said. “This is exactly the moment and I’m sorry it came this way, but we have been talking about the problems inside of health care and buildings for more than a decade. Now the world is listening.”Although the system was connected to the air units in September, Perkins said the wearing of masks and practicing of social distancing are still needed. Perkins said the system makes those steps more effective.Perkins said each unit is customized and it depends on the square footage of each school.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News. All rights reserved.
