Are you a fresh tomato lover? Do you enjoy eating a vine ripe, juicy tomato that is full of flavor? Well, I do and I guess I am a little bit of a tomato snob. I love a vine-ripe, heirloom tomato that might be a funny shape or even a funny color, ones that are mouthwatering good. When I find one that is really tasty, I am known to devour the entire tomato myself.      Growing tomatoes is often the motivation for starting a vegetable garden, and every tomato lover dreams of growing the ultimate tomato. To learn more about growing tomatoes, I decided to ask a neighbor, Rusty Edmonds, who grows more than 50 tomato plants each year.      Rusty said one of his tricks is to choose the best varieties, start the plants off right and control problems before they happen. He grows hybrid ones and heirloom ones. He explained to me some of the differences. I learned a great deal about the different types of tomatoes and some of the dos and don'ts that will be helpful for beginner gardeners.      There are two main kinds of tomatoes, hybrids (determinate) and heirloom (indeterminate). Hybrid tomatoes are called determinate because they have a predetermined number of stems, leaves and size. They tend to be a bush tomato that produces a crop and then they die. Commercial growers like to grow these because they require no pruning; they ripen over a shorter time.      An heirloom tomato is a vine tomato. These tomatoes will continue growing and producing tomatoes until the plant is killed by frost if they are kept healthy. These require more staking than the bush or hybrid tomatoes.      Hybrids are grown for their uniform size, shape, durability to transport, ability to pick before ripe and for their production. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over heirloom plants. Hybrid tomatoes usually out produce heirloom tomatoes but if you save the seeds from a hybrid, you will get a different tomato.      Heirloom means it has been grown for more than 50 years and is consistently grown from the collected seed. Heirloom varieties were all that existed until hybrids were created in the 20th century. Heirloom tomatoes are around today because seeds were saved and passed down from generation to generation. You also can save the seed each year to grow more, as long as the tomatoes were not cross-pollinated with hybrid tomatoes.      The requirements for growing either type of tomato are the same. Start by choosing a good, healthy plant. Rusty mixes some Epsom salt in the hole when he plants along with a little cow manure but he says if you put too much manure, you will get a great big plant but no tomatoes; so just a little manure. Rusty says that to get good quality fruit, tomatoes need an ample supply of potassium (potash), which can be supplied with fertilizer or organic matter. Rusty says that some people put a little wood ash around the plants to get the potash needed but he does not because if you put too much, it will alter the pH or acidity of the soil. Tomatoes like a slightly acidic soil, 6.0 to 6.5. and 7 is natural.      He adds lime to the entire garden and turns it in. He fertilizes about every two weeks with Miracle-Gro for tomatoes. (People who plant in sandy soil will need to feed more often since the fertilizer leaches out quicker, and less often in heavy clay soil.) Do not over-fertilize at first. You can come back and give them more every three weeks. You do not want to burn the plants.      Water regularly, especially when you first plant. You can get blossom rot if the plants do not get water regularly, especially at first. It is hard to be specific on the amount of water. If the plants dry out completely, it is hard to play catch up. If you have a hot dry spell like we often have had during June, you will need to water more often.      It is not mandatory but you can remove the bottom leaves of the plants. This will help you have better air circulation and these lower leaves could become diseased. They are the first to turn yellow.      You know your tomatoes are ripe when they turn a uniform color, red, yellow or pink, depending on the variety you have planted. This uniform color is what you have worked hard to get.      Try a few plants of both hybrid and heirloom tomatoes. This way, you will have early tomatoes that are prolific followed by a continuous crop of heirloom tomatoes until frost comes along.      And as you are enjoying your tomatoes, you'll know you are getting lots of Vitamins A and C, and eating something naturally low in calories and high in lycopene, an antioxidant.      Rusty plants several different varieties of tomatoes. Cherokee Purple, Celebrity, Brandywine and Beefstakes, the largest one. He also planted a smaller one called Tommy Toes, which is also an heirloom tomato. They are so tasty that even our grandchildren eat them. He grows Park's Whooper and Better Boys too that are hybrids.   Now think about planting some tomato plants to enjoy this summer. It is worth the effort and, remember, you can grow them in a pot on your patio as long as you get about eight hours of sun. You could even get hooked.      Betty Montgomery is a master gardener and author of "Hydrangeas: How To Grow, Cultivate & Enjoy," and "A Four-Season Southern Garden." She can be reached at bmontgomery40@gmail.com.

After giving the green light to suspending fees for the time being, Cllr Ken Hawkins, cabinet member for environment and highways, said it was "too early" at this stage to gauge the full impact of Covid-19 on council coffers.
 He denied that suspending the fees was an open invite for people to flock to retailers, but felt the measures would support those businesses which had been allowed to remain open.
 "There is still activity going on [in the town centre], with Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's and pharmacies and other businesses who are working from there to fulfil online orders," he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS).
 Cllr Tim Hodgson (Green, Shirley West) said he supported the decision and the proposals to keep it under review in May and June, when the way out of lockdown and the full economic impact on high streets was clearer.

The White House and the companies struck a deal: Distributors would pay 100% for supplies originating from overseas, while the federal government would pick up the tab per flight -- averaging $750,000 to $800,000 -- to bring supplies to the U.S. faster than by cargo ship. This federal "airbridge" would shave off days or weeks in delivery time.

I will say though, much like sneaking out of a bad party so no one sees and harasses you to stay - that’s how I feel leaving my coworkers, family and friends during this time of social distance. No sad goodbyes, no parties, no tears, just me sneaking off to start a new chapter for myself in this life. The start of this new chapter sure has been riveting, to say the least - what is that saying “in like a lion out like a lamb”, I think I’ll go with that!

Smith added, “Manufacturers are shipping more product, but it’s still not enough. Panic buying has slowed down in some places but not in others. Sanitizers and disinfectants will continue to be in short supply, as well as bleach.”
 For that reason, Smith said, limits will remain in effect on high-demand items that are in short supply.
 We’ve seen the reports about angry shoppers who have abused checkers over these limits, and that’s unacceptable behavior. These store employees are working hard to keep us supplied, and it’s not an easy task.
 “I have to give credit to everyone that works here — the meat department, produce, cashiers — everybody has just buckled down and done what has needed to be done despite being tired and exhausted and overwhelmed,” Lauren Brewster, store manager at Grant’s Supermarket in Bland County, told the Community Newspapers of Southwest Virginia on Friday, as reported on the news outlet’s website.
 “It’s an unprecedented time,” Shane Estep, assistant director for the Food City Distribution Center, told the newspapers. “Every year, we have holidays and every year we have snow scares, but there is no way you can fathom just what these guys are doing to keep food on the shelves.”
 No, we really can’t imagine, because most of the hard work is done behind the scenes, out of consumers’ view.
 But we see the results on the shelves of the stores. And for that, we owe a debt of gratitude to those who are making that possible — from suppliers to truck drivers to warehouse workers to the retail clerks.
 So, at the very least, let’s say “thank you” to those we have the honor to come into (limited) contact with.
 They deserve our praise, not our wrath.

So, in case you aren't up to speed yet, here's a TL;DR version: The WIV is an institute in the city where the novel coronavirus began that was doing research on bats and coronaviruses. The current theory is that, instead of coming from edible bats sold at the Wuhan wet market, the virus somehow came from the WIV, which was close to the wet market in question.

Yes, this whole scam is about one thing and one thing only, preventing President Trump from a second term. They are using the virus fairy tale to prevent campaign rallies and their wet dream is total vote by mail where, instead of We the People personally putting our ballot into the counter, we "trust" a third party to do so(REMEMBER Broward Co Supervisor of Elections?). Honestly, do YOU trust someone to do the right thing with your vote? That is why I always go in person. Even absentee ballots can get "lost" and the D-rats have teams that challenge every one that goes against their candidate. There are literally millions of votes that get thrown out because people did not go in person to put them in the counter. Hell, due to D-rat insistance, early voting makes it easy to vote in person(of course, they wanted it to see how many votes they needed to fabricate on election day, not to help people vote).
