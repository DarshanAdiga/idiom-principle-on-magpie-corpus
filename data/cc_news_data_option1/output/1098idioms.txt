“Overall I would say myself and everyone that I know is extremely overwhelmed,” said Desmond Mills, a Junior in Materials and Metallurgical Engineering. “From a student perspective, having your classes cancelled and having your clubs and organizations no longer meet, a lot of those are quintessential to my identity.” Along with the logistical challenges of learning online, many are finding it difficult to make ends meet financially. “I’d say the biggest obstacle in terms of the COVID-19 response is [that] I no longer have an ability to work,” said Mills. “I was initially hoping to save up some money to have an opportunity at Brown University, but it’s kind of up in the air whether or not I’m going to go and now, at the same time, even if I could go I wouldn’t be able to afford it necessarily.” The decision of whether or not to go home to Utah has been filled with “what-ifs”, and there is still a lot of uncertainty in the future. “You’ve just got to stick to it, and keep strong, and be as independent as you can,” said Mills. “But also rely on all of those that you love, and the ones that love you.”

 According to the Ballard County Sheriff’s Office, deputies stopped a truck on South Kirkman Road for a broken tail light March 13. A narcotics K9 was deployed during the traffic stop with “positive identification.” A search uncovered a backpack that contained what was suspected to be marijuana, methamphetamine weighing more than 3.5 grams, pipes and other paraphernalia.

A list of what qualifies as "essential," is available at our website at sonomawest.com.
 Flattening the curve is a reference to a graph showing the general path of an outbreak. Without social distancing, the curve is very tall and thin, and medical services are overwhelmed. However, by practicing social distancing the curve becomes longer and less vertical. While the total number of infected may not change significantly, medical services are not overwhelmed.
 As of press time, the morning of March 18, there were six diagnosed cases in Sonoma County, according to Dr. Sundari Mase, the county’s interim public health director. Two are from the Grand Princess cruise ship; one is believed to be travel related; two are so-called community transmission, meaning that they picked it up out in the community without there being a direct connection to an exposed person. The origins of one case are still unknown.
 Statewide, there are 472 cases and 11 deaths. Twenty-four are from repatriation flights, 82 are travel-related, 75 are person-to-person transmissions, 98 are community-acquired, 193 are currently under investigation and eight are unknown.
 Most of the cases are affecting an older demographic, with 116 cases in the 65-plus population, and 210 in the 18-64 age group. Globally, there are 153,517 cases, with 5,735 deaths, in 143 countries.
 At a town hall on that took place on March 17, broadcast on KRCB, Mase, chair of the board of Supervisors Susan Gorin and Office of Emergency Services Director Chris Godley answered questions about the shelter in place order.
 They emphasized that while they were very serious about the order, it is not a “lockdown.”
 “This is not a lockdown,” Mase said. “In fact, people will be able to go outside of the house for medical care, to the pharmacy, the supermarket, take your pet to the veterinarian and you’ll definitely be able to go out for a walk to parks and you can get in a car.
 “The whole point, however, is to keep people at home as much as possible,” she continued. “It’s OK to get some peace of mind and go outside the house, but if you do, you should minimize the distances traveled and minimize the number of persons you come into contact with. So, social distancing, keeping six feet away from people around you when out and about, would be great.”
 Because it’s not a lockdown, the town hall panel emphasized that hoarding or stocking up on groceries and supplies was not necessary — the stores would remain open and grocery shopping was still allowed.
 The declaration came on the heels of the first case of community transmission. In a press conference on March 15, county officials confirmed that the first case of community spread of COVID-19. The infected individual is an employee of Rohnert Park Medical Centers, and individuals who have been in contact with that person are in the process of being notified, according to Mase. Another person who has been in direct contact with the infected subject has been tested and is in self-quarantine.
 The community transmission cases were found via the recent increased surveillance testing program, which Mase started on March 12. The positive test was found on March 14.The additional cases were confirmed the next day.
 Mase declined to answer repeated questions about the original positive person’s job within the hospital, where they might have been in the county or whether they were symptomatic, citing HIPAA rules. The question came up again in the town hall on March 17, and again, it was deflected over HIPAA concerns.
 “We really can’t release information, due to patient confidentiality,” Mase said. “If they were the person or the case, they wouldn’t want it out in public either. We can’t release identifying factors. We’re doing everything we can to identify people who they have come in to contact with and asked them to self-quarantine and to report any symptoms or fever. Staff has contacted all of them, we want people to be reassured that we are doing everything we can.”

Over in Mines Park, Madison Anderson, a senior in Civil Engineering, is preparing to move out. Anderson had a pretty eventful past few days, but is remaining positive. “I had plans for spring break to go to Colombia for senior design,” said Anderson. “Obviously those got cancelled, and then the [ASCE regional] conference is now going onto a virtual format. It’s been crazy to say the least. Also getting kicked out of Mines Park, but you know; you adapt and overcome!” Anderson, along with Maddy Caviness, was one of the coordinators of this year’s American Society of Civil Engineers Rocky Mountain Regional Conference that was originally set to happen the week following spring break. A little over a week ago, a few of the Utah universities pulled out of the competition, but on Thursday the decision had been made to cancel all in-person activities associated with the conference. “There has been a lot of frustration, and there have been tears along the way too,” said Anderson. “Because we were holding out hope, I think.” Their contacts at Mines Event Planning had given them the ‘okay’ to keep the conference as planned earlier that week. “It felt like all of this time and energy that we had put into it was basically for nothing, which is not the case,” said Anderson. “ There’s still going to be some element to it, but we were going to have a damn good conference.” The concrete canoe race, sand castle competition, lawn games, and interaction with students from the other schools in the region is going to be missing, and, since the national competition has been cancelled, the winner will not have a next round to move on to. Since our interview, the ASCE regional conference has been canceled entirely. But Anderson still has a positive outlook. “I know there’s a lot of uncertainty associated with [the virus], and with that there’s a lot of frustration and emotions, and there are effects of social distancing, and quarantining yourselves,” said Anderson. “ There are resources out there for people that can talk through these emotions. The Colorado Crisis service is one of those resources. We just need to come together and support each other at this time, rather than getting at each other’s throats with frustration. It’s just coming together as a community… There is that support system there, we just need to lean on it and find it in different ways. Through Zoom, texting, or whatever technology that allows for social interaction with that social distancing.”

It only took a few more hours for the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference to suspend all play through April 6th. “When I heard the rumors that we might not be able to travel out of state for competitions, I brushed it off,” said Sydney Marchando, a junior softball player. “There were plenty of nearby schools to play, and I figured not much would change. When the rumors started, I turned to my teammates who were experiencing the same emotions and going through the same hardship I was… One of my teammates reminded us to stay in shape in case we did get to play on the 6th and we all held out hope.“ About 24 hours later, the conference cancelled the entire spring season. “My heart breaks for the students who were already at their national tournaments, forced to return home before they had a chance to finish what they started two, three, four, five years ago when they walked in the doors at Mines and universities across the country,” said Marchando. “It breaks for the students who stepped on the field, court, mat, and pool for the last time without even knowing it.“ Some things are bigger than sports, but that doesn’t make things any easier for the student-athletes who have poured their heart and soul into competing, only to have their passion stripped away. “The thought of losing nearly an entire season seemed unfathomable only days ago,” said Marchando, “and yet here we are.”

The most pressing requirement, Housman told the Sun, is that people go through the proper process in order to get tested. If a person shows signs of respiratory infection, they should call their primary care physician, who will ask the patient questions regarding their symptoms and other questions relating to a potential COVID-19 infection. If the patient qualifies, that doctor will then set up an appointment for that patient to the Baptist Health testing site.
 An unreleased number of tests have been conducted at the site, though none have come back positive. The site currently has the resources to test about 1,000 people and is expecting to further its capabilities in the coming days.
 People tested will not know their diagnosis right away. Tests conducted at Baptist Health will be processed at a commercial lab in North Carolina with results returned in about five days.
 During a live address on Wednesday afternoon, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear announced that eight new cases of COVID-19 had been identified in the state — with the diagnosees being from Bourbon, Clark, Fayette, Jefferson, Kenton and Warren counties — bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 35. One of the Jefferson County cases is an 8-month-old child.
 To the north, Illinois reported a boom in cases with health officials identifying 128 newly confirmed cases Wednesday morning, bringing the total to 288.
 • • •
 Many Paducah businesses shut their doors early on Wednesday over public health concerns stemming from COVID-19 in accordance with an order Beshear issued the day prior.
 The order included hair salons, gyms, theaters and other public facing businesses.
 “Some of them may have been expecting it to happen especially after Monday’s announcement closing the restaurants and bars. I think that kind of put everybody on notice,” Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce President Sandra Wilson said.
 In light of these recent closures, Wilson and the chamber have been providing resources for area businesses and their consumers on www.paducahchamber.org. This ranges from how workers can file for unemployment insurance, Small Business Administration advice on applying for loans, updates on pending state and federal legislation related to businesses and COVID-19 and how to support local businesses in this time of crisis.
 “Local businesses are the lifeline of our community,” Wilson told the Sun. “It’s important that we do everything we can to support them. We’re pulling together as a community. We’ll get through this and hopefully soon we’ll all be back out together celebrating and conducting business with each other and helping each other.”

Which brings us to the biggest event of all.
 Get ready for the 2021 Tokyo Olympics.
 In what seems a fait accompli, the International Olympic Committee will almost surely be forced to delay the Summer Games for the first time — a staggering move that the organization and its Japanese partners seem to be slowly accepting after defiantly proclaiming for weeks that the games would go on as planned even as the world dealt with a frightening pandemic.
 "We are in solidarity with the whole of society to do everything to contain the virus," the IOC said in a statement after meetings Tuesday. "The situation around the COVID-19 virus is also impacting the preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and is changing day by day."
 Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was even more vague when asked again whether the Olympics, set to begin July 24, could be held on schedule.
 "I want to hold the Olympics and Paralympics perfectly, as proof that the human race will conquer the new coronavirus," Abe said after a video conference with other world leaders this week.
 The best time for that is next year.
 While the IOC has a bit of wiggle room to put off such a momentous decision — the only modern Olympics that weren't held as planned were in 1916, 1940 and 1944, all canceled because of world wars — it shouldn't be stretched out for more than another month.
 That wouldn't be fair to the athletes, who already are facing uncertainty and trepidation over disruptions in training and the loss of valuable competitions that help them prepare for the Summer Games.
 "If they did postpone it, it would take a lot of pressure off this situation right now," said Bob Bowman, longtime coach of the most decorated Olympian, now-retired swimmer Michael Phelps. "People are scrambling. Most people are not training. If we had a little more time to get ready, that would probably be a good thing."
 It would certainly be an enormous, complicated task to postpone the games for a year, given the complex financial web that includes broadcasters, sponsors, sports federations and a couple of hundred national Olympic committees. But it's hard to see any of them putting up too much resistance to staging the games in 2021 in light of current events and the world's economic free-fall.
 A one-year delay is certainly better than other options that have been floated, which include staging events in empty arenas or just canceling the games altogether.
 The first idea would be terribly unfair to the more than 10,000 athletes, not to mention the Japanese people who have furiously scooped up tickets for an event that should be a conduit for their enormous national pride.

My heart breaks for the students who were already at their national tournaments, forced to return home before they had a chance to finish what they started two, three, four, five years ago when they walked in the doors at Mines and universities across the country. It breaks for the students who stepped on the field, court, mat, and pool for the last time without even knowing it. It truly didn’t feel real until I woke up on Saturday morning and didn’t have a game to get ready for. If nothing else, this puts everything into perspective. There are some things in life bigger than sports, as much as those of us who are living in it hate to admit. But college athletics is something we will never get back, and like a season ended in injury, it’s hard to grasp. At this point, there’s a lot up in the air and a lot we still don’t know. The thought of losing nearly an entire season seemed unfathomable only days ago, and yet here we are.

I have been going in circles for days trying to figure out what to say about COVID-19. Everything feels so surreal, and things are changing so quickly that it's very likely anything I put down on paper today will be irrelevant tomorrow.
 And yet, all my life, writing has been my anchor. It's how I process the world. As Joan Didion said, with more drama, "I write entirely to find out what I'm thinking, what I'm looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear."
 Right now, there's plenty of fear and anxiety to go around. We are facing a threat unlike anything most of us have ever encountered. When I was a kid, my nightmares were of nuclear war. I did not expect the entire planet to be laid low by a microscopic virus.
 But here we are.
 Last weekend, things got a lot more "real" for people in the state of Massachusetts as Gov. Baker announced mandatory three-week school closings, a ban on mid-size gatherings and other measures including restrictions on restaurants and bars. Those of us who had already been posting on social media with the hashtag #StayTheF*ckHome were grateful.
 This is new territory for all of us and we need to adapt quickly.
 Changing our behavior is not easy, but it's necessary. The data coming in from other countries is irrefutable. We need to learn from their mistakes if we have any hope of heading this thing off at the pass and that means practicing vigilant social distancing by limiting interaction with other people as much as possible. This is critical whether you are healthy or not, whether you have symptoms or not. The CDC puts the incubation period for COVID-19 between two days and 14 days from exposure. That means someone can be walking around with this (and passing it along to others) for up to two weeks before showing any symptoms. The fallout from a single person's failure to practice social distancing can literally put hundreds of thousands of people at risk.
 But, while we need to keep our distance physically, it's more important than ever to maintain and strengthen our connections emotionally. This pandemic is stripping the veil from our eyes in so many ways. It is forcing us to admit that none of us is an island; we are each dependent on the other. It is uncovering the many ways in which our systems -- health, economic, and justice -- are deeply, deeply flawed. It is compelling us to confront the fragility of our existence.
 And, in some cases, it is revealing the worst sides of humanity -- hoarding and stealing critical supplies, price gouging, racism and incredibly selfish behavior.
 All of this is hard to take -- the disruption to our daily lives, the constant fear and uncertainty, the hard truths that are coming to light.
 And yet, there is also, as my friend likes to say, "beauty in the madness." All around the world, including here in the U.S., strangers are helping strangers. People are reaching out with words of comfort, critical information and financial aid. In Italy, where 60 million people are in lockdown, the streets are reverberating with hope and joy as Italians join in song, serenading each other from their balconies.
 It is also, for many people, providing an opportunity to slow down, re- evaluate our priorities, and reconnect -- with ourselves, our loved ones and nature. But even this silver lining is tarnished by the fact that this opportunity is only available to those that can afford to step outside of the daily hustle. It is not possible for everyone to stock the pantry and freezer for weeks of hunkering down. And many people will face extreme financial hardship if they lose even a single week of work.
 We must practice compassion, empathy and do what we can to help our neighbors near and far.
 Of the many (many) things I've read over the past two weeks, it is something pediatrician Dr. Steve Silvestro said that stuck. At the end of a piece on the topic of playdates -- bottom line: don't have them -- Silvestro suggested that this crisis might be our "Greatest Generation" moment. He meant that we are all being called upon to pitch in and make individual sacrifices for the greater good of all.
 I truly hope we are up to the task.

After a special board meeting Tuesday night, Little Hands Childcare Center in Hiawatha has decided to reopen next Monday.
 After the state's recommendation on Saturday that schools remain closed this week, Little Hands closed March 16-20.
 On Wednesday, Kyle Olson, board president announced on Facebook that Little Hands would reopen.
 Little Hands Daycare will resume normal operating hours on March 23.
 "We appreciate your patience while the staff cleans and prepares the center for the continued safe care of your children," according to the announcement. "We are following the recommendations from KDHE and will notify you if changes are needed to the regular operation of Little Hands."
 Olson told the Hiawatha World that currently, daycares are exempt from CDC guidelines on social distancing and assembly size.
 "This is an ever-changing scenario, so only time will tell what the future will bring," he said. "As of now, the board is just wanting to care for as many displaced children as we can and are still crafting procedures and best practices to keep children and staff safe."
 The center will accept new applications for early childhood and school age kids on a first-come first served basis by emailing the child's name and birthdate to littlehandsinc@gmail.com.

As a jockey Chris Munce shared Group One glory with syndicator Shelley Hancox and he is planning to do the same as a trainer.
 Munce won the Group One Goodwood Handicap on Sword who was raced by one of Hancox's syndicates.
 Hancox has been one of Australia's most successful syndicators for three decades and she was among the first to support Munce when he switched to training.
 They have combined with several winners including Johnny Whitesox and Urban Ruler who ran in last year's All-Star Mile.
 Munce is hoping they might have something special in Al Jood who was a Sunshine Coast winner over 1400m at her most recent run.
 Al Jood steps up to 1600m in the Chairman's Club Handicap at Eagle Farm on Saturday.
 Munce believes the distance is the perfect stepping stone towards a tilt at the Group One Queensland Oaks.
 "She has the right bloodlines and I have been impressed with her from day one," Munce said.
 "Shelley has a great eye for a horse and we have had the Oaks in mind for some time.
 "There is a way to go yet but I would be disappointed if she doesn't take a step up."
 Munce is looking at a good winter with several horses including three-year-old Stampe and two-year-old Boomnova who were minor placed in the rich Jewel races at the Gold Coast last Saturday.
 "They were great in their respective races and I am sure they are up to the winter," Munce said.

The Northern New York man who faces charges for the death of a Brant Lake man during a high-speed chase with police last September has been indicted on new charges that accuse him of driving under the influence of alcohol and eight drugs when he fled from police.
 Skyler B. Crouse pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Warren County Court to two additional charges — second-degree vehicular manslaughter, a felony, and misdemeanor driving while ability impaired by combined drugs and alcohol.
 Court records show he was found to have nine different potential intoxicants in his bloodstream, including alcohol, cocaine, the opioid Fentanyl, marijuana and various prescription drugs, court records show. Tests also found a 0.05 blood alcohol content.
 The new charges will postpone a trial in the case that had been set for April 6, and reset the six-month clock for a speedy trial. No new court date was set after Wednesday’s proceeding.
 The blood test results were received after Crouse was indicted last October for the death of Joseph Turcotte, and Warren County prosecutors decided to pursue the additional charges after Crouse rejected a plea deal earlier this month.
 Crouse’s lawyer, Matt Chauvin, asked Warren County Judge John Hall to set bail, but Hall opted to remand Crouse to Warren County Jail without bail.
 Chauvin said the new charges were not a surprise, as he knew more charges were possible once the blood tests were complete.
 “We are going to have our expert review the results,” he said.
 Crouse, 30, of Akwesasne, pleaded not guilty last October to a 12-count indictment for the high-speed chase on the Northway that began in Queensbury and bizarre actions afterward when he exposed himself to Glens Falls Hospital staff and police and spit on a television news cameraman. With the new charges, he now faces 14 counts.
 The charges stem from a wild 25-mile chase from Queensbury to the town of Chester last Sept. 26.
 State Police tried to stop him for driving 93 mph in a construction zone in the northbound lanes near Exit 18, and he fled north at speeds of up to 111 mph.
 Police said Crouse ran several vehicles off the highway and nearly hit a Warren County sheriff’s officer who tried to use tire deflation devices near Exit 23.
 State Police were able to use a tire deflation device on one of Crouse’s tires about a mile south of Exit 25, but Crouse continued on and got off the exit before hitting Turcotte’s pickup truck from behind, killing him instantly when his truck flipped over.
 Police said Crouse fled his heavily damaged truck on foot, but was arrested by officers in woods near the exit.
 He later told police he was “insane,” was a heavy drug user and was late for a birthday party.
 Crouse faces up to 25 years in prison for the weightiest charge, first-degree assault.
 Crouse has listed a variety of addresses around the state and the Akwesasne Indian reservation on the Canadian border with northern New York in the months since his arrest.
 Turcotte, 38, was a well-known boat-builder who served on the Horicon Planning Board.

Cam McCarthy will get a chance to reinvent himself when he steps out as a wingman in Fremantle's clash with Essendon at Marvel Stadium on Saturday.
 McCarthy was touted as a future star forward when he was taken by GWS in the first round of the 2013 national draft.
 The 194cm spearhead showed his potential with 35 goals in 20 games in 2015, and hopes were high he could reach even greater heights when he joined Fremantle in 2017 after a year out of the game.
 But McCarthy has struggled as a forward in the last three seasons, booting just 63 goals in 48 games for the Dockers.
 New Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir told McCarthy to train up as a wingman during the pre-season, and the 24-year-old will get the chance to showcase his talents in round one.
 McCarthy's emergence in the new role is important as Fremantle attempt to fill the hole left by departed wingmen Brad Hill and Ed Langdon.
 "It is a good story," Longmuir said.
 "The thing that's allowed him to do it is that he's been open to the challenge.
 "It doesn't mean he won't play forward for us at any stage. But he's really applied himself to the (wing) role.
 "He's done all he can from an upskilling point of view with his coaches. He deserves his opportunity."
 New recruit James Aish and Brett Bewley are others who will play significant game time on the wing.
 Longmuir confirmed that forward Sam Sturt would make his AFL debut, while Alex Pearce (ankle), David Mundy (leg), and Nathan Wilson (toe) are closing in on full fitness.
 Defender Stephen Hill will miss at least several weeks with a quad injury, while Blake Acres (hamstring) and Joel Hamling (ankle) are longer-term injuries.
 A return date on Jesse Hogan (personal leave) remains up in the air while he focuses on his mental health.
 Fremantle players were due to get the rock star treatment on Thursday in their mission to escape the coronavirus during their trip from Perth to Melbourne.
 "It looks like at this stage we'll meet in the car park and walk through the airport as a group and try and distance ourselves a little bit from the general public," Longmuir said.
 "We've got a chartered flight that Virgin have provided us, so we'll be on a plane by ourselves. We've obviously got the hand sanitisers and face masks and that sort of thing as well."

County staff are working on a similar option for Albemarle’s upcoming budget hearing on April 13, should severe restrictions on gatherings still be in effect. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to adopt a tax rate on April 15. But the county still could choose to hold additional public hearings or work sessions up until May 14, if the spending plan needed further adjustments.
 Charlottesville is considering an extension as well, but as of this writing had not made a decision. Another public hearing is set for April 6, and final approval originally was anticipated for April 14. But Mayor Nikuyah Walker said the city might extend the budget process.
 In some ways, the city’s budget has generated even more contentiousness than the county’s, with disagreements not only over funding for firefighters and police, but also regarding allocations for education and affordable housing. For those reasons, Charlottesville residents and leaders might need even more time than Albemarle to achieve a satisfactory budget.
 Neither jurisdiction can extend the budget process indefinitely, of course. They must have spending plans in place when the new fiscal year rolls around on July 1.
 But delaying action amid this evolving crisis is to hold options open as long as possible so decisions can be made with the most up-to-date information. It’s a wise thing to do.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK -- The United States and Canada closed their shared border to "non-essential traffic" on Wednesday to curb transmission of the coronavirus as U.S. President Donald Trump moved to bolster medical equipment supplies and the outbreak struck Capitol Hill.
 Two members of the U.S. House representatives - Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Ben McAdams of Utah - said on Wednesday they had each tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first lawmakers in Congress known to have become infected.
 The implications for Capitol Hill were not immediately clear. The news came as the U.S. Senate passed legislation providing over $100 billion in emergency spending for free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net benefits.
 Trump quickly signed the measure into law. Hours earlier, the Republican president said he would invoke the Defense Production Act to allow the government to accelerate production of medical equipment such as face masks and other protective gear during the health crisis.
 "It's a very tough situation here. You have to do things," Trump said as he sought to escalate government action to address a public health crisis that he had initially made light of but has more recently likened to a war.
 The defense statute, enacted in 1950 at the outset of the Korean War, empowers the president to expand industrial production of key materials or products for national security and other reasons.
 Wall Street on Wednesday extended a four-week plunge in the face of deepening concerns over a fast-spreading and potentially lethal respiratory virus that has paralyzed large sectors of the U.S. economy and led to fears of a global recession.
 VIRUS IN ALL 50 STATES
 The Trump administration has been criticized for a slow initial response, with the United States now facing shortages of diagnostic testing kits and other essential medical supplies.
 With cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus reported in all 50 states and the total number of known U.S. infections closing in on 8,000, millions of Americans are staying at home instead of commuting to work or going to school.
 The U.S. death toll has climbed to at least 151.
 New York, Washington state and California accounted for most of the cases, with the largest cluster of U.S. deaths from the illness - 62 - documented in the greater Seattle area.
 California Governor Gavin Newsom said his state's massive homeless population posed its own potential complications to the crisis. He cited computer models showing more than 60,000 people living without shelter in California could become ill with the coronavirus in the next eight weeks, badly straining the state's healthcare system.
 Trump said two U.S. Navy hospital ships would be pressed into service, one to New York, the other on the West Coast. But U.S. defense officials said one of them, the Comfort, was undergoing maintenance in Virginia and it could take weeks before the vessel could head to New York Harbor.
 Trump said closing the border with Canada for 30 days was by mutual consent and would not affect trade.
 The two nations share one of the world's largest trading relationships, and their economies are highly integrated.
 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa travelers could no longer cross the border for recreation and tourism.
 "Our governments recognize it is critical that we preserve supply chains between both countries," Trudeau added.
 The U.S.-Mexico border would remain open, Trump said.

 On top of the legislation signed into law on Wednesday, the Trump administration, as part of a $1 trillion stimulus and rescue proposal, asked Congress to approve $500 billion in cash payments to taxpayers in two rounds - on April 6 and May 18. It is also seeking $50 billion in loans to U.S. airlines, which have been pummeled by the pandemic, according to a document seen by Reuters.
 Some Senate Republicans have called for delivering $1,000 checks to taxpayers, but Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said they should receive more.
 It remained unclear whether the coronavirus diagnosis of two House members might hinder further congressional action.
 Diaz-Balart, 58, a Republican, said he placed himself under self-quarantine in Washington on Friday after appearing on the House floor for a number of votes that day.
 He said he developed a fever and headache on Saturday evening and got a positive test result shortly thereafter.
 McAdams, a 45-year-old Democrat, said in a statement from West Jordan, Utah, that he had developed "mild cold-like" symptoms on Saturday evening after returning from Washington and isolated himself at home on Sunday.
 He was tested for coronavirus at a local clinic on Tuesday after his symptoms worsened, and learned he had tested positive on Wednesday, McAdams said.
 The House is due to return next week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The two meetings scheduled for Tuesday at Taunton and Wetherby went ahead as planned behind closed doors.

WATERTOWN — The calls for commercial buildings to be cleaned are up and the calls to clean houses are down in the age of coronavirus, and Servpro is leaning in to keep its staff employed. And the risk is nearly as high as cleaning up after a “trauma scene,” where a person has died and bodily fluids are left behind.
 Servpro, a 24-hour emergency cleanup service that primarily deals with water, fire and mold damage, doesn’t take on a lot of commercial business.
 But on Friday, March 13, the service fielded nearly 10 calls from different organizations, all inquiring about whether Servpro can clean their large facility as a preemptive measure against the coronavirus outbreak. There was a school district in St. Lawrence County, another in Fort Drum; an apartment complex that owns seven properties in Watertown; and a warehouse distribution center in Ogdensburg.
 “It’s definitely spiked because of coronavirus,” said Mark Zegarelli, who runs the Servpro with his wife, Mary, and daughter, Sarah Kingery. “And we’ll do it.”
 Mr. Zegarelli, Mary and Ms. Kingery — and their staff of six technicians and a crew chief — have had long discussions on whether to take these jobs after those initial inquiries.
 “I was very opinionated at first,” Ms. Kingery said. “But we have to keep our employees paid.”
 That’s the bottom line. With the outbreak comes isolation and social distancing — hardly a recipe for people to hire a team to come clean their carpets.
 “People don’t want strangers in their houses right now to clean carpets,” Mr. Zegarelli said, “and if they’re unemployed, they don’t have the money to pay for it, so that business has pretty much shut down right now.”
 Around four times a year, their business is asked to respond to what is known as a “trauma site,” mostly a scene where a person has died and was left unattended for a period of time, or a person has died by suicide. What’s left behind is whatever the coroner leaves behind — whether that be blood, human tissue or other bodily fluids. Mr. Zegarelli said they responded four times to a person’s house who was taking a blood thinner medication. They’ve cleaned up a scene after a man used a firearm to commit suicide in his office, or — their first suicide cleanup — when another who did it while standing underneath a ceiling fan set to high.
 They’ve cleaned-up tear gas, a meth lab and numerous biohazards. One time, Ms. Zegarelli said, they were sent to a cottage on the water where a smell had built inside. They investigated and went back to the cottage four times before narrowing it down to one room. The crew decided the stench was coming from inside the wall, so they removed it, and out came several dead fish a mink had pulled in there to eat.
 In all those cases, there are vaccinations and shots that technicians can take to prevent from contracting an illness like hepatitis or HIV.
 “There are no shots to prevent you from getting coronavirus,” Ms. Zegarelli said. “But we’ve talked with our employees, and they’re just like ‘you guys aren’t going to send us into a situation and protect us’ is how I think they feel.”
 Trauma scenes are different from disinfecting a commercial building for coronavirus. With a trauma scene, what needs to be cleaned is visible. With a commercial building — especially after the first area case of coronavirus was confirmed this week — everything has to be cleaned, especially high touch areas like tables, chairs, doors and keyboards. Full tyvek suits will have to be worn by the crew, with a full-face respirator, double gloves, chemical resistant boots, goggles and masks. None of that would have been required before the first case was confirmed.
 “Obviously they are done a little bit differently, Ms. Zegarelli said. “But I feel the risk is up there.”
 And there’s no guarantee the coronavirus would be completely scrubbed from a building after their team goes in.
 “The assumption is it’s effective against coronavirus, but we don’t market it that way.” Mr. Zegarelli said about the cleaning materials they plan to use. “We’ll just tell people we’re disinfecting the building.”
 On Wednesday, Mr. Zegarelli said, as far as they know, the education center in Fort Drum is going to be putting out to bid for a cleaning.
 Above all, Servpro in Watertown is open for business when it comes to disinfecting buildings for coronavirus. And it’s not on a voluntary basis like trauma scenes.
 “It’s part of the job,” Ms. Zegarelli said. “That’s how we’re feeling about this. And we’re going to do everything we can to make sure our employees have the proper (personal protective equipment) and to make sure they understand what has to be done.”

WATERTOWN — Dr. Stephanie Oliva is doing everything she can to find protective equipment for her team after she and the nurses there shared and reused three gowns for two days.
 She’s desperate, unsure if she can protect her team and trying to provide the best care after many offices have closed.
 “I got a message from a concerned nurse today,’ said Dr. Oliva, sitting in her office at her private pediatric practice, “who said ‘you really shouldn’t make it public information that you’re reusing a gown. That looks really bad.’ I said ‘but it is really bad that we don’t have gowns and I kind of want gowns,’ so I’m kind of weighing.”
 Dr. Oliva decided to keep her office open through the COVID-19 outbreak. She and her team are at the front line continuing the fight.
 “Our nurses would do anything for their patients,” she said. “They would walk into a fire. And they trust me completely to protect them, and lately I worry that I can’t; and it’s awful.”
 Her office, along with so many across the country, is running out of protective personal equipment, or PPE. That includes respirators, gloves, gowns and eye protection. With supplies running low, medical professionals have had to compromise.
 Since COVID-19 is likely airborne, nurses and doctors were advised to use a N95 respirator, a mask that seals around the mouth when treating a patient with a cough or a fever, along with eye protection, a gown and gloves. Once there weren’t enough N95s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgraded its recommendation to only using a surgical mask, Dr. Oliva said. There are guidelines to safely reuse a N95 respirator, Dr. Oliva said. The more pressing and immediate danger is the low number of gowns, which without one can carry germs from one patient to the next.
 And Ms. Olivia’s practice, Pediatric Associates of Watertown, ran out of gowns over the weekend. After hustling to call as many possible providers over the weekend, a local office donated three.
 Thus, creating what Dr. Oliva calls the “Germ Room.” It’s a small office — last week it was the nurse practitioner’s — that’s now the staging area where nurses who are done with one of the three gowns can go in, take it off, spray it with disinfectant and then hang it up.
 Dr. Oliva said she’s tried placing orders for more equipment with suppliers for a month. She’s also reached out to public health for an emergency order — it’s unclear if that will come to fruition. Her head nurse and manager were reaching out to vendors all last week, but no gowns were in stock. They went to as many stores as they could find in the area, but they were all sold out.
 Dr. Oliva said she also reached out to Samaritan Medical Center for gowns that were discarded after tasks like administering oral medication. She offered to purchase the discarded gowns at full price.
 She was denied, saying the hospital told her it wouldn’t be right to give used gowns out that are possibly contaminated.
 “I know they can’t say yes to that,” Dr. Oliva said. “In the meantime, we have all these people coming in and we’re swabbing them, and I’m sure some will be positive, and it’s just not right that we have to reuse equipment.”
 Dr. Oliva said her team is going to continue to offer care for as long as the office can, namely because pediatrics is a specialized field.
 “It’s a privilege to take care of people when they’re sick, and that’s kind of what we signed up for,” Dr. Oliva said. “The reason we’re still open is the reason I live here. My patients need me. I am from Southern California, as is my husband and our families. But we choose to live here. There’s just not an abundance of people who can do this job.”
 Since she has started doing outreach this week, her office has received one pack of PPE from an anonymous donor, and another from VCA North Country Animal Hospital.
 Despite it all, Dr. Oliva’s office might have had to reuse and sanitize some gowns and masks, but they are doing it in the safest way they can. Her ultimate goal is to protect her nurses and save lives. Her “dream” is to have a gown for every patient encounter that she can discard after use by next week.
 “I would never make them do something that they feel uncomfortable with,” Dr. Oliva said about the nurses. “But there have definitely been tears this whole week — just people feeling scared and unsure.”

There might not be any retail stores to visit for a while, but that’s not slowing Apple’s roll. On Wednesday morning, Apple launched a brand new MacBook Air with more storage, more speed, and a better keyboard, all for hundreds less than the current model.
 With a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 or i5 processor, Apple claims the new MacBook Air delivers “up to two times faster CPU performance and up to 80 percent faster graphics performance” than the previous MacBook Air. Both base models have lower clock speeds than their predecessors (1.1GHz vs 1.6GHz), but the new chip architecture, Intel Iris Plus Graphics, and LPDDR4X memory should deliver a noticeable boost.
 In addition to the faster chip, Apple has also doubled the storage across the board to 256GB and 512GB for the base configurations, along with a new 2TB option for an additional $600, twice as much capacity as before. Apple had offered a 1.5TB option last year but it was dropped in July.

Besieged St George Illawarra coach Paul McGregor has issued his so-called "March premiers" with an early-season edict: fire up before becoming NRL also- rans once more.
 The Dragons host Penrith on Friday night at Kogarah's Jubilee Stadium with McGregor already under the pump to deliver following a season-opening loss to Wests Tigers.
 Time and again over the past decade the Dragons have made lightning starts to campaigns only to falter at the pointy end.
 Little wonder then that, amid calls for his new premiership-winning assistant coach Shane Flanagan to take over, a slow start to 2020 doesn't bear thinking about for McGregor.
 "The start of the year's very important. You don't want to be chasing teams in the early rounds because you've lost a couple of games," he said on Thursday.
 "We put ourselves in the position to win (last week's) game on multiple occasions but we just didn't."
 McGregor is expecting especially big things from Matt Dufty, who has snatched young gun Zac Lomax's No.1 jumper after recovering from a broken cheekbone sustained during the pre-season Nines.
 The coach knows Lomax, having been promised the fullback role and trained there all pre-season, will be smarting after being shunted to the wing despite bagging a try and clocking a league-high 10.1km in round one.
 But he said the move was not form-based but out of necessity due to a quad strain to Mikaele Ravalawa.
 "I think there would be some disappointment there for sure," McGregor said.
 "He hasn't shown it within the group because it was a team-first decision that Zac was moved because we didn't have anyone else to play on the wing.
 "Duff's in a really good position to perform well because I haven't seen him work that hard in a pre-season - he really had an amazing pre-season.
 "He's gone from a person that didn't really like training to owning training and certainly his values around the team about what needs to be done has improved out of sight.
 "So I'm looking for Duff to go out there and really be exciting."
 McGregor has also placed stars halves Corey Norman and Ben Hunt on notice.
 "Our first 35 minutes was nice and controlled (against the Tigers) but we didn't finish the half well. And our second half with the finishes to our sets with our kicking game and our last six kicks were all negative," he said.
 "So the takeaway from that is making sure that our priority this week is to get the best kicks as possible.
 "We don't want to have to make 120 tackles."
 If he's personally feeling the heat, McGregor's not admitting to it.
 "It's round two of a two-year contract and I'm committed," he said.
 "So the only focus I have is what's important now and that's this week's game and the future will look after itself."

Hopefully this will all fly by. We’ll have a few weeks of isolation, and maybe a lot of playing video games or discord chats or whatever. But other than that, you’ve just got to stick to it, and keep strong, and be as independent as you can. But also rely on all of those that you love, and the ones that love you.

Overall I would say myself and everyone that I know is extremely overwhelmed. From a student perspective, having your classes cancelled and having your clubs and organizations no longer meet, a lot of those are quintessential to my identity… Not having that so much, not having those social interactions is difficult. I’d say the biggest obstacle in terms of the COVID-19 response is [that] I no longer have an ability to work. I was initially hoping to save up some money to have an opportunity at Brown University, but it’s kind of up in the air whether or not I’m going to go and now, at the same time, even if I could go I wouldn’t be able to afford it necessarily.
