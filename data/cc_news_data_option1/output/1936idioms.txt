“She was the heart of our team,” said Barnes-Graham. “She’s hard on herself. She’s grinding all the time. She works hard every time. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a kid that worked as hard as she does in everything that she does.”
 Honea made waves early at Cove, earning the district newcomer of the year award as a freshman. She earned a spot on the second team as a sophomore and finished her prep career with back-to-back appearances on the first team.
 Honea proved skilled on both ends of the court. She averaged three steals per game last season.
 “She’s a great defender. She’s really improved on her defense,” said Barnes- Graham, who has also seen Honea from the perspective of an opposing coach. Barnes-Graham was an assistant at Belton before taking over at her alma mater last summer. “Her senior year was the best I’ve seen her play defense, and that’s something she really wanted to improve on.”
 Honea was also a standout cross country runner at Cove, winning the district championship last fall and qualifying for regionals in each of her four years. Honea has been running since elementary school, but she’ll stop doing it competitively next season and focus on basketball at Angelo State.
 “It’s definitely going to be weird not running,” she said.
 Honea played in many big games at Cove and accomplished a lot, but she counts the camaraderie with her teammates among her favorite memories.
 “Those girls were like my family,” she said. “They’re my sisters and it’s going to suck not playing with them anymore and being around them 24/7, and always having the different personalities around.”

 That sounds good to a lot of seniors navigating financial fallout during the coronavirus pandemic. Stay-at-home orders may have taken away jobs needed to make ends meet, while low interest rates and a volatile stock market have endangered income from retirement savings.
 A reverse mortgage could be exactly the right tool at the right time. Or it could be an expensive mistake. It's important to understand exactly how these loans work and to explore alternatives before you commit.
