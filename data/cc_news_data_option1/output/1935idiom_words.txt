"People are trying to move away from a state of fear to a state of caring on social media," she added. "What I've noticed is there's this trend, especially on Instagram, where the cannabis community is really strong, with care- mongering with cannabis. So it all started the first package I got."
 Campbell first heard from someone who asked for her address to drop off seeds, hemp rolling papers and some weed.
 "Because it was the first week of COVID-19 (lockdown) we did not see each other, we did not touch, we did not smoke cannabis together," she said.
 "He just left the care package on my front door and I just took photos and thanked him and sprouted all the seeds, smoked the cannabis, and it was just like this really awesome thing," added Campbell. "And it's becoming almost like a trend. Like if it happens to one person you kind of pay it forward."
 Since then, several sources have provided Campbell with cannabis products, including a rosin press which can make cannabis oil extract from the marijuana buds. She decided to drop seedlings off to pals.
 "I made these little to-go packs," recalled Campbell. "I found these like little clear plastic Dollarama containers that had a little handle on them and put a little bit of soil, a few of the seedlings 'cause they're still really tiny, and I just went to all my friends who I know would appreciate it and I dropped off two to four plants per person.
 "So now for my friends in Toronto â€¦, I've got four or five different friends growing (plants) from the seedlings from the seeds that were given to me. It's just like a really cool trend."
 Single households can have up to four weed plants (and condos and apartments, too, as long as it's not prohibited by a lease agreement). If you're mailing cannabis, the law allows Ontario residents aged 19 and up to send others up to 30 grams of pot or as many as four seeds.
