President Donald Trump has threatened to slap new taxes on American companies to dissuade them from moving their manufacturing bases from China to countries like India and Ireland instead of the US amidst the Covid-19 pandemic.
 In an interview with _Fox Business News_ , Trump said that taxation was an incentive for the companies to return manufacturing bases to the US.
 Apple said now they’re going to go to India. They’re going to do some production in India away from China, he was asked. “If they do, you know, we gave Apple a little bit of a break because they’re competing with a company that was a part of a trade deal that we made. So it was a little bit unfair to Apple, but we’re not allowing this anymore. You know if we wanted to put up our own border like other countries do to us, Apple would build 100 per cent of their product in the United States. That’s the way it would work, he said.
 According to the _New York Post_ , Apple is looking to shift a significant portion of its production to India from China.
 Supply lines of many tech companies manufacturing in China were disrupted after the deadly coronavirus outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
 These...companies have to get on the ball, because they’re going not only to China...You look at where they’re going...They’re going to India and they’re going to Ireland and they’re going all over the place, they make them,” Trump said in the interview. “So, you don’t think you need to do anything in terms of incentives,” he was asked. “I have to do it,” Trump said.
 “One incentive, frankly, is to charge tax for them when they make products outside (the US). We don’t have to do much for them. They have to do it for us,” Trump said.
 Trump said that he wants to bring manufacturing back to the US.
 “And now they’re not fighting. These stupid supply chain that are all over the world, we have a supply chain where they’re made in all different parts of the world and one little piece of the world goes bad and the whole thing is messed up. I said we shouldn’t have supply chains. We should have them all in the United States. We have the companies to do it. And if we don’t, we can do that,” he added.
 Trump has routinely threatened to raise tariffs on consumer electronics during his ongoing trade war with China.

Peaceful Nelson, Nevada, offers visitors a step back in time to the vibrant mining days of Nevada, the Silver State, an escape from daily life.   This ghost town is off the beaten path, and while standing among its historic buildings one would not think they were just a 45-minute drive from the bright lights of Las Vegas. Those traveling from Vegas on Route 95 will also pass Eldorado Canyon and "the monument," Nevada Historical Marker 9.      After an enjoyable ride through the valley travelers will come upon several original buildings from the 1700s. Originally, Nelson was called Eldorado, named by the Spaniards. They were the first to find gold in the mountains. About 100 years later the miners and prospectors developed the Techatticup Mine, which stands today in Nelson. The mine has a clouded reputation of killings that resulted from labor and management disputes. However, in 1861 the mine was considered to be the most important in the canyon as it produced millions of dollars of gold ore. The mine, a short distance from the Colorado River, was served by steamboats. The name Techatticup came from two Paiute words meaning "hungry" and "bread."      This now ghost of a town produced millions of dollars of copper, silver and gold until the mine closed in 1945.      Today mine tours are offered by stopping at the General Store in Nelson to sign up for the Eldorado Canyon Mine Tours. The buildings offer a historic tour of collectables from the area. Canoe and kayak rentals are available for those wanting to take an adventure on the beautiful Colorado River.      Inside the General Store is a small museum with pictures and information on the filming that takes place at Nelson, along with memorabilia and historic information. All ages will enjoy exploring the museum and walking around outside finding old cars, trucks and airplanes. The planes were used as props for the movie "3,000 Miles to Graceland." This ghost town is a popular area for use in movie backdrops, photo shoots and music videos. The National Geographic Channel's "Brain Games" was filmed in Nelson, as were the movies "Eye of the Beholder" and "Breakdown."      Do not get your hopes up when you travel downhill and see the Texaco sign standing tall among the historic buildings of Nelson. It is also historic. There is not a gas station or place to eat here. However, the General Store offers snacks and drinks. Fill your tank before setting out to visit Nelson.      Once you have completed the exploration of Nelson, continue to the end of the road where a spectacular view of the Colorado River awaits. Pack a picnic and find a rock, bring chairs, or sit in the car and enjoy what nature has to offer. Visitors can walk down to the river from this area.      Coming back uphill from the river, continue past the general store and on the left will be a few houses and a dirt road, Main Street. Turn left and follow it for a desert drive. If it is raining or has recently rained, better go back the way you came. If you are short on gas or time, do not do it! However, if you do continue, it is a climb to the top where big eared jackrabbits might be seen. Keep your camera ready as road runners are fast but you might get a picture, and the burros are much slower -- they will pose longer.      The road will take desert adventurers back down to Highway 95. A left turn goes into Searchlight, another mining town which, in its heyday around 1902 was more populated than Las Vegas. Today about 500 residents call this town home.      A few buildings are left from the mining days. Searchlight has modern structures, too -- gas stations, places to get a drink and some food, including McDonalds. Las Vegas is one hour from Searchlight and 30 minutes from Laughlin.

"We need to know what this really means for airports, and we are pushing hard for those details.
 "We feel this should be time-limited or we will see an impact on the industry as a whole - in my personal view it could only work for weeks, not months."
 Mrs Smart highlighted how a risk-based approach should be used depending on where people are travelling from, as well as understanding whether testing would be available.
 "We are in constant dialogue with the Government to make this practical and to get people moving," she added.
 "And there is meant to be something outlined by the end of May, so not far off."
 While international travel will ultimately be governed by each country's guidance, airlines have started to show willingness to get back on the runway.
 "The biggest question I get asked is when will be flying again and honestly, it's hard to say," Mrs Smart added.

Now, as the Government outlined its first detailed plan for its departure from lockdown, Mrs Smart has shared how the airport is preparing and what we can expect when arrivals reopen.
 "From looking at other transport industries in the last few days, it's clear there's been a huge increase in numbers and we are working to understand how we can make the airport safe in preparation for when it's our turn," she said.
 "Within our group [Manchester Airport Group - MAG], we have started trials at our sister airports in Stansted and Manchester where staff and passengers are asked to wear gloves and masks.
 "They are also trialling thermal imaging technology which can do anonymous temperature checks on passengers.
 "Realistically there has to be a multi-layered approach to this. Social distancing just is not going to be practical both on and off airlines."

As Florida and other states phase in reopening, industry groups are stepping up their push to protect businesses, health care providers and nursing homes from coronavirus-related lawsuits.
   
 The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing Tuesday on the wide-ranging legal liability that could grow out of the pandemic. And in Tallahassee, proponents are preparing legislation for when lawmakers are called back into a still-to-be scheduled special session.
   
 "There has to be a forum to present the legislation, but we're ready to go," said Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, chairman of the budget committee on criminal and civil justice.
   
 Hospital associations and the nursing home industry, an epicenter for the coronavirus spread in Florida and nationwide, have urged Gov. Ron DeSantis to expand by executive order the state's "Good Samaritan" law. They want doctors, hospitals and health care providers shielded from being sued over any problems stemming from care given during the pandemic.
   
 DeSantis has been noncommittal. But Brandes said the Good Samaritan law -- crafted to protect health care professionals from liability when performing life-saving, on-the-spot care in an emergency -- generally requires that someone "voluntarily responds," without payment.
   
 Because of this provision, Brandes said the Legislature should go ahead and expand the governor's emergency power to grant legal immunity to health care providers, steps already taken in New York and Michigan, whose Democratic governors have broader authority.
   
 Business groups, though, don't want to stop there.
   
 They also want the Legislature to enact measures that would at least blunt lawsuits stemming from actions taken during the state of emergency DeSantis first signed March 9 and which he has now extended into July.
   
 Brandes said such changes wouldn't grant blanket immunity to companies, but it would help those that followed government guidelines during both the shutdown and phased-in reopening. Still allowed would be lawsuits involving claims of gross negligence or reckless misconduct by a health care provider, company or employer.
   
 But the Florida Justice Association, the state's trial lawyer organization, said lawmakers should not fall for the latest round of demands from business groups seeking expanded legal protection.
   
 The pandemic presents fresh challenges, said FJA President Leslie Kroeger, a Palm Beach Gardens lawyer, but it should not force anyone to lose their legal rights.
   
 "I just see a huge gap," Kroeger said. "The state and most businesses are talking about reopening safely. Then you have another group which is talking about how we're intent on not going to get sued.
   
 "To me, that suggests that if you're already talking about not getting sued, maybe you're not focusing on safety enough," she added.
   
 She called the move "a grab."
   
 "It's big business and their lobbyists just trying to promote tort reform and taking advantage of an horrific pandemic," she said.
   
 Nursing homes officials, Kroeger added, regularly push state lawmakers to reduce staffing requirements and inspections, and now are struggling to manage a virus that has proven devastating to their residents.
   
 But Kristen Knapp, spokeswoman for the Florida Health Care Association, the state's nursing home industry, said that even a proposal that companies meet government guidelines to gain legal protections could fall short of a guarantee.
   
 Recommendations for the kind of facemasks that should be worn have varied among agencies, she pointed out.
   
 "In the midst of this unprecedented crisis, long-term caregivers should be able to direct their skills and attention to helping individuals who need them, and not have to worry about being sued for making these types of tough decisions while trying to comply with government directives," Knapp said.
   
 Florida House Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami, has expressed concerns about legal liabilities facing businesses and would probably support some review of the issue by the Legislature, said spokesman Fred Piccolo.
   
 Republicans and business groups lobbying for liability protection argue that such action is needed to protect companies restarting operations after extended shutdowns, along with those that were allowed to remain open to customers with a scaled-back workforce, who also may have risked exposure to the virus.
   
 The COVID-19 Complaint Tracker, a national database maintained by the U.S. law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, showed almost 1,000 coronavirus-related lawsuits since Jan. 30. Nearly 30% of the lawsuits involved litigation arising from prison conditions. Florida had 82 lawsuits included in the tracker.
   
 Critics say such numbers don't suggest that there's a deluge of lawsuits. And, they add, existing law still will make it difficult for a plaintiff to win a claim that coronavirus was transmitted by a visit to a store or restaurant.
   
 But supporters of new limits say the lawsuits are likely only beginning to emerge.
   
 "There's a lot of confusion, and businesses need protection from lawsuits and workers compensation claims," said William Large, president of the Florida Justice Reform Institute, which argues for reducing business exposure to lawsuits.
   
 "There needs to be clarification, and the concerns go beyond health care providers," he added.
   
 Scott Shalley, president and CEO of the Florida Retail Federation, said help is needed.
   
 "Florida's retail stores are making sincere efforts to keep their teams and their customers safe, based on all the information available," Shalley said.
   
 But he added, "We are concerned there are trial lawyers anxious to take advantage of this crisis with frivolous lawsuits aimed at small businesses, and it is important to protect this industry from further, unjustified harm."
   
 In Washington, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is demanding that protecting businesses from lawsuits linked to COVID-19 be a condition to approving another stimulus package to help states and local governments deal with budgets battered by revenue losses caused by the widespread shutdowns.
   
 The Judiciary Committee began its work on legal liability, hearing testimony from the CEO of the Kwik Chek convenience store chain, a representative of the union for meat packing workers, and a South Carolina tourism official.
   
 While McConnell may be able to get some changes through the Senate, the Democratic-led U.S. House is a different matter, with trial lawyers and labor groups resisting efforts to offer any kind of broad lawsuit protections to companies.
   
 In a Republican-controlled state like Florida, business and health care groups probably have a better chance. But even in Tallahassee, liability changes have proven a tough sell.
   
 Against the backdrop of so many issues that have risen to prominence amid the pandemic -- massive budget shortfalls, a dysfunctional unemployment compensation system, an uncertain school calendar and a tourist industry mostly shuttered -- Republicans would be challenged if they put up lawsuit limits as a priority in a special session.
   
 Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, who has been working with hundreds of Floridians struggling to file claims for unemployment benefits in Florida's problem-plagued online CONNECT system, said that GOP leaders are prioritizing the needs of large corporations while ignoring many other needs.
   
 They've condemned the risk of lawsuits filed by patients, customers and workers, even as some congressional Republicans have promoted lawsuits against China over the coronavirus.
   
 "It's a clear reflection of where the governor's and where the Republican Party's priorities are," Eskamani said. "They're not coming to help working Floridians."
   
 Rich Templin, with AFL-CIO-Florida, also said any effort to restrict lawsuit rights should be watched closely.
   
 "I don't think anybody would argue that it may be worthwhile to examine our current liability laws in this new reality," Templin said. "But that's not usually what happens in Tallahassee.
   
 "Instead, there are powerful interests that push to allow companies to operate with impunity just because they don't want to be held responsible for their actions," he added.
