On Capitol Hill, lawmakers are evaluating possible steps to help the airlines, including federal loans and tax relief, according to a Republican aide on the House Transportation Committee.
 Lawmakers also are looking at letting airports use money raised for infrastructure projects on operating costs such as janitorial expenses or servicing debt, said the aide, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the discussions among lawmakers.
 Senator Edward Markey, D-Mass., said Congress should put conditions on aid to airlines. “Financial assistance may be needed for some of our most impacted industries,” he said, “but any infusion of money to the airlines must have some major strings attached,” including a ban on “unfair” fees for changing or cancelling a ticket, and targets for reduce carbon emissions from airline planes.
 Around the globe, airline bookings are plummeting and cancellations soaring as governments restrict travel and people fear being enclosed in an airplane for several hours during a pandemic that has already sickened about 170,000 people and killed more than 6,500.
 Late Sunday night, United Airlines announced that it would slash 50% of its flying capacity in April and May and warned that the cuts could extend into the peak summer travel season. Even with thousands fewer flights every week, the airline expects its planes to be only 20% to 30% full at best, and March revenue will be down by $1.5 billion.
 “The bad news is that it's getting worse,” CEO Oscar Munoz and President Scott Kirby said in a letter to United’s roughly 96,000 workers. “We expect both the number of customers and revenue to decline sharply in the days and weeks ahead.”
 American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights through at least May 6 and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May.
 Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.

Technical chart claims that Agree Realty Corporation (ADC) would settle between $74.41/share to $76.03/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $69.76 mark, then the market for Agree Realty Corporation becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $66.74 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -5.49. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

The NHL is pushing back the possibility of resuming its season by several weeks, if not a month or more.
 The league and NHL Players’ Association told players Monday they can go home — even out of North America — and must self-isolate through March 27 while the season is on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the NHL also cautioned that it will not be able to even provide guidance on the potential reopening of team practices for another 45 days, which could push any potential return to play into May.
 The new directives come on the heels of the CDC’s recommendation against gatherings of 50 or more people in the U.S. for the next eight weeks. The NHL said “depending on world developments,“ consideration will be given to reopening facilities after the self-quarantine period ends in late March but practices for the 31 teams would not happen late April — at the earliest.
 “I think in light of the CDC recommendations, it’s hard to foresee that we’re looking at much happening here in March or even April, in my opinion,” agent Jay Grossman said.
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and NHLPA executive director Don Fehr each said Friday he was not aware of any player testing positive for coronavirus.
 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver last week said his league’s hiatus would likely last at least a month. After saying last week the season was on “pause,” Bettman had not put a time frame on when the NHL might resume play.
 “The pause will be until it’s appropriate and prudent and safe to start back up,” Bettman said last week. “Nobody knows how long the hiatus may be. Nobody, even the medical community, can predict it with certainty.”
 The U.S. government has imposed a travel ban from Europe for non-citizens that extends until mid-April. There are currently 233 European players on NHL rosters, including leading scorer Leon Draisaitl from Germany, and there are more on contracts who are in the minors. How many might return home is unknown.
 “I’ve spoken to some players who are doing their best to obviously scramble to return to the safest, most comfortable environment that they can get to at this point,” Grossman said.
 The NHL suspended its season with 189 games remaining before the playoffs. Bettman said he remained optimistic about resuming and still awarding the Stanley Cup, which has only not been handed out twice since 1893: 1919 (Spanish flu outbreak) and 2005 (lockout).
 NHL players previously were directed to stay in their team’s city and wait. The league and union had discussed the possibility of players returning to team training facilities within the next week or so, but that plan has changed.
 “We’ll be constantly in touch with the NHL and constantly re-evaluating,” Fehr said last week. “Any date you pick out is merely going to be a best guess and it has about as much likelihood of being right as any other best guess.“
 Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told The AP teams had been instructed to take care of arrangements for and pay players under contract.
 — Arizona Coyotes defenseman Aaron Ness became the first NHL player publcly known to have been tested for COVID-19. Agent Neil Sheehy said results came back negative after Ness followed NHL guidelines to seek out testing for flu- like symptoms.
 “He never thought he had it to begin, with to be quite honest,“ Sheehy said by phone. “What happened is the league was saying if you have a sore throat, if you have a runny nose, if you have a cough, call the trainer and don’t come to the rink, and so he did that.”
 — The American Hockey League, the NHL’s top minor league teams, said the indefinite suspension of its regular season won’t be lifted before May. The league also said it was recommending its teams work on returning players to their primary homes.
 — The Kontinental Hockey League is taking a one-week pause in its playoffs to come up with a new format and schedule for the six remaining Russian teams. Finland-based Jokerit and Kazakhstan-based Barys Nur-Sultan pulled out of the playoffs amid the pandemic.

LOUDONVILLE -- Since 2000, members of the senior class at Loudonville High School have conducted a fundraising project to benefit the Loudonville- Perrysville School Foundation.  
 In continuing the tradition this year, they will collectively perform a series of 10 to 15 acts patterned after the TV show "The Masked Singer" (Fox network, Wednesdays at 8 p.m.) on Saturday, March 21, at 7 p.m. Doors will open at 6:30 p.m.  
 "We decided to go with this theme because of the great success of senior classes the past five years conducting an entertainment-based fundraiser,' Class President Sarah Carroll said.  
 "We thought about hosting a 5K run this year," Vice President Seth Rhoads said, "but preference for entertainment won out, with classmate Cade Beachler clinching the decision by suggesting The Masked Singer theme."  
 The past four years classes have collectively raised over $15,000 for the school foundation with entertainment-based events, a talent show in 2016, lip synch competition in both 2017 and 2018, and Senior Night Live in 2019. In 2015, the class performed a comedy-based version of Shakespeare's Othello and raised nearly $3,400.  
 "Entertainment, particularly fun entertainment, seems to be a key for success," Carroll said.  
 Earlier fundraisers have run the gamut of creativity, from the debut "link to the Millennium" in 2000; a walkathon in 2004; Cow Patty Bingo in 2007; several dodgeball tournaments and a couple of basketball benefits; a taffy pull; and, in 2005, seniors working around town, including planting the maple trees that line much of the Ohio 3 bypass south of Loudonville.  
 The fundraisers have generated $52,582 in their 20 years, according to Mike Bandy, founder and president of the Foundation. That's an average of $2,580 per year.  
 That money is invested by the Foundation into the Ashland County Community Foundation, with some of it returning each year in the form of grants for the local school system. In 2000, the first grant amounted to $500 used to purchased materials for a new reading series at the R.F. McMullen Elementary School. Last year the annual grant totaled $16,065, going for the STEM/Robotics program, classroom novel sets, choir materials, disabilities curriculum and five teacher mini-grants.  
 In the past 20 years, $109,303 in grants have been invested back into the school district by the Foundation, Bandy said.  
 Back to the March 21 Masked Singer fundraiser, Courtney Hollinger, class secretary, said that different acts will be run in competition against each other, with all performers disguised in some sort of mask. Part of the challenge, for the audience, is to figure out who the performers are, while also judging which performance is better. The performers will compete in a tournament format, with the ultimate winner selected by a three-judge panel. Only when the final winners are announced will the performers be unmasked. Trophies will go to the championship performing teams.  
 Hollinger said that there will be at least 30 student performers in the benefit, along with at least 10 or more faculty members, hopefully some from every school building in the school district.  
 Admission for the event is $10 for adults and $5 for students, with tickets available in the high school office, at Buzzard's Family Shoe Store, and at the door.  
 Guests also are encouraged to bring in canned or non-perishable food items, which will be donated to the local food pantry, Helping Hand.  
 "Individuals may bring up to 10 items each, which will be traded for raffle tickets for four $25 gas cards," Emily Seboe, another class officer, said. "Winners will be drawn during the event."

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - As businesses shut down and events are cancelled, the real estate market presses on.Some homeowners say they are changing the way they show their homes, because of concern over the virus.But, 19 News discovered that prospective buyers are still coming to see them in droves.According to a new survey, one in four people have changed how they are showing their homes right now, but that could just mean putting hand sanitizer on the counter for visitors.Megan Montforton is selling her family’s Fairview Park home by owner. She and her husband had been planning for some time to list it this Spring.“We’re expecting another child and outgrowing this home,” she said.She says they didn’t feel like they had a choice but to let people come see it this week. But, she’s trying to stay safe by offering hand sanitizer to visitors.“It’s kind of hard to sell your house, if you don’t want people to come in and look at it,” she said. “So, you don’t really have an option.”A recent survey done by the National Association of Relators, discovered the market has been affected over virus concerns-- but probably not as much as you would think.About 9% of realtors said last week that concerns have caused people not to list their homes.And, only 13% of realtors said they’ve seen buyer interest go down.Wade Clark says he’s been trying to buy a house for a few months.“It’s just one of those things where I need to move anyway. I’m not going to let this delay my plan or process of what I want to do,” he said.Friends have weighed in recently about the uncertainty of the economy right now.“People are like you should just wait and see what happens,” Clark said.But Clark says he can’t afford to do that, and he doesn’t want to miss out on the perfect home.“Where I’m at in my life, I don’t want to wait,” he said. “Maybe that’s selfish, but i’m just going to keep doing my thing and hopefully find a house that I want to get.”According to the realtor’s association, the housing markets in Washington State and California have been most effected by corona virus concerns. They have both seen a high number of cases.Copyright 2020 WOIO. All rights reserved.
