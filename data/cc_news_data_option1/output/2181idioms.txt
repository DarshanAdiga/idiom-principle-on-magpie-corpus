“There’s a tremendous amount on the line, not only for casinos, but for the community and the state,” said Alan Feldman, a longtime casino executive who is now a fellow at the International Gaming Institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “This is an extremely important moment.”
 Casino resorts were shuttered March 17 after Gov. Steve Sisolak’s emergency order closed nonessential businesses to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 Property owners, state regulators and Sisolak, a Democrat who has been criticized for the closure, balanced health concerns against the loss of billions of dollars a month in gambling revenue and unemployment that topped 28% during an idled April.
 They're betting that safety measures — disinfected dice; hand sanitizer and face masks; limited numbers of players at tables; temperature checks at entrances to some resorts; touchless cellphone check-ins — will lure tourists back.
 “I’m optimistic that customers will see that gaming properties invested time and effort to welcome them back to a safe and entertaining environment,” state Gaming Control Board chief Sandra Douglass Morgan said Wednesday.
 The regulatory board required detailed health safety plans from resort owners before giving the go-ahead to reopen.
 “This is going to be a pretty long, slow climb,” said Feldman, who was with MGM Resorts when Las Vegas experienced an abrupt air travel stop after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and later a crippling plunge in business during the Great Recession. “I’m hopeful it is a consistent climb, without setbacks."
 Recovery from the recession took years — reaching best-ever numbers last January and February, when taxable casino winnings were at $1 billion each month and unemployment was at an all-time low of 3.6%.
 By April, unemployment reached 28.2%, topping figures in any state even during the Great Depression. Casino winnings were near zero.
 The biggest casino operators, MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, won't immediately open all their Strip properties. Executives said they want to see how many people show up.

However, that may not have been the case if the U.S was not locked into a trade war with China, in which Huawei ended up losing big time. This is because Trump's administration has been expressing distrust on Huawei products, which it claims may be used to spy on the U.S. This distrust led to a ban on the unauthorized use of Huawei products, thus preventing the company from securing a dominant position as a 5G provider in the U.S.

Hundreds of protesters were in New York City's Washington Square Park when the charges were announced.
 "It's not enough," protester Jonathan Roldan said, insisting all four officers should have been charged from the start. "Right now, we're still marching because it's not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change."
 The mood in New York turned somber later in the day after a police officer on an anti-looting patrol was ambushed by a man who walked up behind him and stabbed him in the neck. Two other officers suffered gunshot wounds to their hands in the struggle, and the attacker was in critical condition after being shot by police.
 The new second-degree murder charge alleges Chauvin caused Floyd's death without intent while committing another felony, namely assault. It carries a heavier sentence than the third-degree charge, which is punishable by up to 25 years behind bars.
 The other officers face the same maximum penalties.

It is important to improve the intake of calcium and  Vitamin  D.  Vitamin D is required for calcium absorption. Calcium is the most common mineral in the body,  about  99 per cent of which is  in bones and teeth, the  remainder being  in  the  blood  and  soft  tissue,  where  the concentration  range  is narrow  to facilitate bodily  functions.  This  is  so  important  that  the body  will pull  calcium  from  the bones  to maintain  other  levels  if calcium  intake  is  insufficient. It  is  best  for the  people  to  begin adequate  calcium  intake  at  an  early  age  as  the  bone mass begins  to decrease after  the age  of  30\. The  best  sources  of  calcium  include sesame seeds, ragi, organic A2 milk, and its products,  leafy  greens, seafood/bony fish, and  legumes. Not  only  calcium,  other minerals like magnesium,  phosphorous  and  boron  also  contribute to  the bone  health. Hence,  including magnesium  and  phosphorus rich sources like - whole grains, lean  cuts  of  chicken,  beans  and  lentils,  nuts  and  leafy vegetables,organic A2 milk and  milk products  is important. The best and most reliable source of Vitamin D is morning sunlight! We should  ensure  that  the body  is  adequately  exposed  to  the sun  during the  day  to  synthesise  a good  amount of Vitamin  D.  Foods like mushrooms,  fatty fish  (tuna, mackerel,  salmon),  cod liver oil, and egg yolks,  etc.  do contain  Vitamin D  in  some  amounts.  In  most  cases,  additional supplementation  of calcium  and  Vitamin  D  are required (it's  best  to  get the  levels checked  before supplementation). One  should  consume  calcium/Vitamin  D3 supplements on  an  empty  stomach  as  these nutrients  are best absorbed  in an acidic medium, and always keep your healthcare professional in the loop before making any changes.

“A month ago, it was nurses, doctors and golf pros and we couldn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “Not so much anymore — back to normal.”
 The principal source of consternation, a concern shared mostly by serious not casual golfers, is new health guidelines that have affected the golf hole itself. In an effort to reduce high-touch surfaces from golfers reaching into holes to retrieve their balls or removing the flagstick, course operators have tried various solutions, including raising the white liner cup, which is normally inserted in the hole, to about 2 inches above the green surface. An approaching ball bounces off the cup liner instead of falling into the hole.
 The United States Golf Association, a national governing body, issued a temporary rule amendment in March that qualified such a situation as a holed shot — with caveats (more on that later).

Waterjet propulsion specialist HamiltonJet said it is currently working with Norway-based Offshore Windservice AS to convert five vessels from controllable pitch propeller (CPP) to waterjet propulsion and advanced control technology.
 At project completion, all five vessels will feature twin HM721 waterjets coupled with HamiltonJet's intuitive AVX controls.
 While HamiltonJet has already supported more than 80 offshore wind farm vessels globally, the company's CEO, Ben Reed, says, "It's the first time these two products have been paired together, and the first time we've put waterjets of this size into a wind farm vessel. It means these boats will really power along."
 For the Offshore Windservice AS project, HamiltonJet devised a creative solution to retrofit waterjet technology into the existing fleet. "This clearly shows you don't have to buy a new boat when a refit meets the brief," Reed says.
 With one vessel complete and the second underway, Offshore Windservice AS is progressing the refit at pace.  
 "We actually ended up installing the waterjets on the first vessel ourselves, and it couldn't have been easier," says Billy Thøger Kristensen, Chief Operating Officer at Offshore Windservice AS.
 "We were even more pleased that in the process of replacing the engines, gearboxes and CPP drivelines for new engines, gearboxes and Hamilton waterjets, we've saved around five tonnes of weight, including many kilograms of cables, which has significantly reduced the vessel's draft."
 "The speed has significantly increased on what was predicted, while the new set-up has far less vibration and noise than before. It's resulted in a much more comfortable ride for the crew and turbine engineers. That's important in a vessel regularly working out at sea for a week at a time," Kristensen says.
 The operator is also impressed with HamiltonJet's AVX control system. "With AVX we're able to access HamiltonJet's JETanchor system, the best hands-free technology on the market. It's two operational modes of Station Keeping and Virtual Anchor greatly simplify the job of our skippers in open water," Kristensen says. "It's a life-changing tool for our skippers and crews."

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — Organizers have scrapped plans to mandate social distancing during President Donald Trump's appearance at a July 3 Mount Rushmore fireworks display and won't limit the crowd due to coronavirus concerns, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said Thursday.The Republican governor said the National Park Service is dolling out 7,500 tickets via lottery for the event, which marks the first time in a decade that fireworks will be set off at the memorial in recognition of Independence Day.“There will be no better place to celebrate our independence,” Noem said. “We are excited that President Trump will be joining us for this event.”Event organizers did not reduce the number of tickets due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Noem said she isn't concerned an influx of tourists would heighten the risk. Coronavirus infections are on a downward trend in the state and hospitals are prepared to handle more infections if needed, she said.People who don't get tickets to the event will be able to gather outside the monument grounds to watch the fireworks, Noem said.Secretary of Tourism Jim Hagen said there will be fewer tickets offered than in previous years, but that was already in the works to help with crowd control.The state is actively marketing itself as a summer tourism destination, but Hagen said he expects more people are interested in road trips rather than flying.
