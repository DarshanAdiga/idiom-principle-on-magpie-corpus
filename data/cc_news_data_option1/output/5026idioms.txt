  "You look at all the stats, they're in our favour but at the end of the day it's about putting the ball in the box."


  He then later went on to add: "There were a lot of good parts where we penetrated the penalty box on numerous occasions, just to find the last pass or the final ball and the goal came through, we didn't hit it, they blocked it - it was a lot of things to happen.


  "If we generate it every week we will win football matches. At the moment it looks like we need to do a lot to score a goal."

A homeless man was arrested Monday for allegedly breaking into the vacant Massachusetts mansion owned by Tom Brady and his wife, model and businesswoman Gisele Bundchen.


  Police in Brookline, Mass., said they arrested Zanini Cineus, 34, who faces charges of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, attempted larceny and trespassing. Cineus is expected to be arraigned later Monday.


  Police responded to the Boston-suburb home after a security company reported that alarms had gone off in the house.


  "The suspect was found lying on the couch in the middle of the room," a Brookline police spokesman told reporters.


  Cineus also was arrested last year and accused of stealing a signed Brady jersey worth $10,000 from the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.


  Brady and Bundchen previously listed the 12,112-square foot home for sale at an asking price of $33.9 million, but it was taken off the market amid the coronavirus pandemic. The family currently lives in Florida, where Brady plays for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady played 20 seasons with the Patriots.

Eagles coach Doug Pederson said he doesn't know whether it will be Carson Wentz or rookie Jalen Hurts at quarterback when Philadelphia host the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.


  Speaking on WIP radio in Philadelphia on Monday, Pederson said he hasn't made up his mind about his starter as the season slips away from the Eagles (3-8-1).


  The always vocal Eagles fans already have spoken, though. Just one hour into a 24-hour poll posted on the station's Twitter feed, 67.2 percent of respondents said it was time for the team to turn to Hurts.


  Wentz, 27, is in the midst of the worst season of his five-year career. He leads the league in interceptions (15) and sacks (50), and is 31st in completion percentage (57.4). He was yanked in the third quarter of Sunday's 30-16 loss to Green Bay after completing just six of 15 pass attempts for 79 yards.


  Hurts, the Heisman Trophy runner-up in 2019, was 5-of-12 passing for 109 yards, throwing one touchdown pass and one interception.


  "I didn't know what the plan was fully. I was just told he was going in for the next play and the next series," Wentz said after the game. "So I didn't really know what was going on there. Obviously, that's frustrating as a competitor and just the personality that I have, I want to be the guy out there. But it is what it is. They made the call today.


  "At the end of the day we lost, as a team we lost, and that's what I think for me I'm most frustrated about. I don't like where we're at this season record-wise and I know I can play better and we can all be better going forward."

Even as we speak, battery technology is fast developing to look beyond the standard lithium and cobalt chemistry. Solid-state batteries‚Äîsuch as non-flammable aluminium air and zinc air ones‚Äîhave emerged clear winners for operations in high and low temperatures. The solid ion battery, built on the abundantly available sodium metal, is another alternative to lithium (and it charges almost five times faster than Li-ion), and flow batteries that are vanadium- and ferrous-based are perfect for grid storage.
