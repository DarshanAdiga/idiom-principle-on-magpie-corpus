La crisis del coronavirus ha desbordado de trabajo a las asesorias. La avalancha de empresas que han decidido presentar un ERTE, la coincidencia con las declaraciones trimestrales de IVA, IRPF y pagos a cuenta del Impuestos de Sociedades, ademas de las declaraciones de renta han saturado los despachos, provocando que algunos hayan tenido que realizar jornadas maratonianas de lunes a domingo para intentar cumplir los requisitos en tiempo y forma.
 Junto a todo ello, denuncian que han tenido que soportar los numerosos errores y retrasos que se han encontrado a la hora de comprobar los datos de los trabajadores en la plataforma digital del Servicio Publico de Empleo Estatal (SEPE), ademas los inconvenientes del cierre o la no asistencia presencial de los empleados de la Conselleria, SEPE o la Tesoreria de la Seguridad Social.
 Una situacion que, segun los gestores, les ha dejado en un desamparo total y que, al mismo tiempo, han tenido que sufrir las exigencias de la empresas para resolver sus problemas, de los trabajadores para que les tramiten su paro y de los autonomos para gestionar las ayudas que ha ido anunciando el Gobierno.
 Cada vez que se anunciaba una medida provocaba una montaña de trabajo y una carga extraordinaria para las asesorias que, a su vez, han tenido que aguantar la presion de la gente que no cobraba y que les exigia poder hacerlo porque necesitaban dinero para comer.
 Los asesores aseguran que han intentando afrontar el aluvion de trabajo con la maxima responsabilidad y profesionalidad, a pesar de que las normas y los criterios de interpretacion cambiaban de un dia para otro, al igual que los retrasos en su publicacion, la inseguridad juridica o el mal funcionamiento de las plataformas electronicas.

WHEN Mick Bermingham was selected at right full-forward on the inaugural All Star hurling team in 1971, it was a rare boost for Dublin at a time when they had dropped considerably from the high of a decade earlier. In 1961, they won the Leinster SHC title for the first time since 1952 and came within a point of Tipp in the All-Ireland final. Unfortunately for Dublin, Bermingham&rsquo;s honour wasn&rsquo;t a sign of better days ahead. It was another 19 years before Dublin next won an All Star award (Brian McMahon, full-forward 1990) while Leinster glory eluded them until 2013. Two years earlier, they won the Allianz League title for the first time since 1939.That was quite a turnaround, overseen by Anthony Daly, who arrived in Dublin at precisely the right time for that particular squad.Two of the stars of the 2011-2013 successes, Liam Rushe and Conal Keaney fill our top two positions. Rushe is the only Dublin hurler who has won two All Star awards (midfield in 2011 and centre-back in 2013). His versatility has enabled him to play in defence, midfield or attack, depending on the requirements of a particular situation.Indeed, his ability to repair leaks all over the place, while very important for Dublin, may have prevented him from reaching his full potential in one particular position.Keaney&rsquo;s adaptability was even more pronounced. He began his inter-county career with the hurlers in 2002 before later switching to football. Keaney returned to hurling in 2011, just as they were heading into an exciting phase that delivered two major titles in three seasons. He was still going strong last season at the age of 36.1.

ENVIOUS eyes were cast in Westmeath’s direction in 1986 when David Kilcoyne was chosen at right full-forward on the All Star hurling team. It was the county’s first award in either code. If the 24-year-old old Ringtown man could force his way past so many of the game&rsquo;s elite, what was to stop others doing the same in future years?Westmeath weren&rsquo;t winning major titles around the mid-1980s, but did get to a level where Kilcoyne and his colleagues could be judged against the best. In 1985/86, they finished second to Wexford in Division 2, placing them ahead of Tipperary who went on to win the Munster championship 15 months later.Westmeath beat Tipp in that League, finishing seven points clear of a team that included Nicky English, Bobby Ryan, Ken Hogan and Noel Sheehy. Kilcoyne scored 1-8 of Westmeath&rsquo;s 1-18 total.Later in that season, Westmeath were unlucky to lose a League quarter-final to Kilkenny by two points, with Kilcoyne again showing his talents against a vaunted defence. He had proven conclusively that he had the capacity to thrive at the highest level, as recognised later in the year by the All Star selectors.Current full-back, Tommy Doyle (fifth in ranking) is another example of a man who would prosper if he got a chance to test himself against the top-ranked full-forwards on a regular basis. He did an excellent marking job on Seamus Callanan in an All-Ireland qualifier in 2017, but unfortunately for him he didn&rsquo;t have regular opportunities to compete with the best until this year when Westmeath played in Division 1, where he did very well. That came as no surprise to anybody who has followed his career.1. David Kilcoyne2. Brendan Murtagh3. Michael Kilcoyne4. Michael Cosgrove5. Tommy &lsquo;Jogger&rsquo; Doyle 6. Darren McCormack7.

Startup African-American channel Aspire has named former GMC executive Paul Butler as its general manager, the network announced Tuesday.
 Butler will oversee all operations of the Magic Johnson-owned Aspire, which is set to launch next month. Butler most recently was GMC's senior vice president and general, a role he will continue to serve while transitioning to Aspire. GMC is handling operations for Aspire leading up to its launch.
 "We conducted an extensive search for the right person to lead Aspire and found that he was right here all along, and already on the GMC team," said Johnson in a statement. "Paul has a long track record of success with GMC with a wide range of responsibility and oversight. With his background and the fact that he was heavily involved in GMC's tremendous growth, Paul is definitely ready to hit the ground running to ensure a successful launch and a great future for the network."

Complete Coverage: Cable Show 2012
 Boston -- When Conan O'Brien was forced out of _The Tonight Show_ in 2010, he had to   choose not just whether to stay at NBC but decide where he thought the   television industry was headed, the talk show host told CNN host Piers Morgan   during the general session here Wednesday morning.
 "I felt like I was standing with one foot in traditional   broadcasting and one foot in this new world that we're all trying to figure   out," O'Brien said. "And the divide ran right between me and I had to make a   jump one way or the other."
 As everyone knows, O'Brien chose to make the jump to cable   and TBS, where he hosts his show for a much smaller, if younger and more   technically savvy audience, than he did on network TV. O'Brien said he and his   team have spent the last year and a half trying to figure out how to navigate   that new world of social TV.
 "I never pretended to know anything about any of this," he   said. "The whole experience I went through with _The Tonight Show_ , we saw this grassroots movement just spring up,   which I didn't frankly even know existed. I was forced to embrace this world   and figure out how to use it."
 O'Brien's first discovery was one often preached by TV   executives -- it's all about content. "People constantly try and overthink the   Web and I think funny content is funny content," he said.
 While he said the TV broadcast still gets most of his focus,   he was surprised at how much focus has to be put into making digital-only   content to promote the show in a way that engages the audience.
 "What you're doing with social media is constantly trying to   figure out ways to create a symbiotic relationship," O'Brien said. "It's not   just driving people on social networks to your television show. Yes, you want   to do that. But you want to get people in the TV emotionally involved in what   you're doing on Twitter and Facebook."
 That happened recently when Will Ferrell chose to announce   the _Anchorman_ sequel on _Conan_ in a surprise appearance that the show's digital team distributed online   via several video clips in advance, which ended up driving viewers to _Conan_.   O'Brien said it underscored how much the business has changed from when he   started in 1993 and "the obsession was never give anything away."
 "The days of ‘I only want people to experience me at 11   o'clock on TBS,' those days are over," he said. "The audience is too fractured,   they're too distracted, and a whole generation is growing up that doesn't watch   television that way."
 O'Brien praised his experience at TBS and said the biggest   difference between working at that network and NBC is how quickly ideas can be   pushed through on cable. And he has no regrets about the jump he chose.
 "My attitude the last couple of years was adapt or die," he   said. "I chose I think this is where it is going. The last year and a half has   just been a complete -- for me, anyway -- affirmation that that's the way to go."

In a digital world, content is king, and even if no   individual show broke out at last week's upfronts, media buyers applauded the   investment being made in original programming across the industry.
 "It's great to see the big TV-based media companies investing in their   product and doing their best to engage viewers with content, which is more   important than ever," said Chris Geraci, president of broadcast at media   agency OMD.
 While talk about digital has increased, "most of the big ideas begin on   TV," Geraci said, adding, "It makes sense to follow that TV-based   content wherever it engages consumers, regardless of platform."
 While there was more talk about multiple-screen, cross-media and social media   than ever before, screening shows and talking about program strategy dominated   the presentations, as they have in past years.
 But buyers and network executives mostly agreed that was appropriate because   while it might be traditional and a bit old-fashioned, it's still where the   viewership -- and the money -- is.
 "Everybody's talking about the second screen. The first screen must come   first. There's no second screen without it," CBS CEO Leslie Moonves said   during his net's upfront.
 But while there was a lot of programming to see from the broadcast networks --   plus Turner and USA- nothing seemed to stand out.
 "I don't see the _Idol_ , I don't see the _Desperate Housewives_ ,   the show that's going to hit and the network's ratings going up 20%. I don't   see any of that," said Sam Armando, senior VP, director of strategic   intelligence at SMGx.
 Instead, there were a lot of comedies and a number of edgy, mysterious dramas,   the kinds of shows more likely to have a loyal audience than a large one.
 "I'm not saying [ABC's] _666 Park Avenue_ or [Fox's] _The Following_   or [NBC's] _Revolution_ will fail, but rarely do you see those shows being   the ones that put a network over the hump."
 John Muszynski, chief investment officer at SMGx, added that he didn't see enough   clips during the presentations. "I think more than ever, I have to see   pilots before I really make a decision," he said.
 Buyers have entered the tight-lipped phase of the upfront where negotiations   begin. But they said that in the past few days, the gap between how much money   they thought would be in the market and the networks' expectations had   narrowed, which may mean smoother talks.
 While many clients still haven't finalized their TV ad budgets, "from what   I've seen, [demand] is not as aggressive as sellers thought, and I think the   sellers are acknowledging that," said Muszynski. "With the scatter   market a bit soft, I don't see this market as a runaway of any kind."
 And because each network is offering a somewhat different twist on how it   prefers to handle digital advertising inventory, the process could slow down.
 "Digital makes it more complicated," said Mike Rosen, president for   activation at Starcom. "Some of the networks need to sell their digital   inventory in order to see revenue growth."
 "All of the networks are acknowledging that digital is important, and some   even went as far as to talk about how they're going to sell," Muszynski   said. "We haven't seen any of those details, and I really seriously   question whether we're going to be able to incorporate that into this year's   upfront."
 At ABC, Geri Wang, president of sales, said the network was prepared to sell   both its TV and digital commercial inventory together. "In a world of   fragmentation, we are offering aggregations," Wang said. "We are   moving from individual silos to one united video strategy" and creating an   opportunity to buy "several screens with one single deal...one CPM and one   guarantee on every screen."
 At Fox, sales chief Toby Byrne noted that the network's business is not limited   to TV anymore.
 "We want to make it easy for your brands to be with our shows, however the   audience chooses to watch," Byrne said. "With our Fluidity model, Fox   will continue to be the one-stop shopping destination, packaging your specific   mix of Fox programming across our multiple distribution platforms...in one   upfront deal."
 Fox Networks chairman Peter Rice noted that clients are also interested in   getting involved with the network's social media power.
 Rice said Fox formed a team called The Bridge that will provide tailored   digital solutions, including apps, branded environments and social campaigns.   It will also track social activity of Fox shows to help clients reach and   engage more consumers with customized content extensions.
 With its young audience, the CW has been selling its commercial time on a   converged basis, offering advertisers packages that include spots on shows   running on TV, on the Web, via its app and mobile.
 The CW is using its own form of measurement, based on double-click streams, to   measure the number of viewers watching its shows and its ads.
 Rob Tuck, executive VP for ad sales at the CW, said the network was working on   a measurement system that measures what marketers care more about than   demographics-whether the ads are selling products. "That will be coming   down the road," Tuck said.
 NBC Broadcasting chairman Ted Harbert highlighted a number of business issues   at his network's upfront. "If we're going to spend all this money on   content, it has to be measured and monetized," he said. With programming-   and ad campaigns airing on multiple screens- the industry needs cross-industry   measurement. "We can't wait for Nielsen to do it," Harbert said.
 With so much viewing of primetime programming happening on a delayed basis,   "it's time to consider moving to a C7 metric," Harbert said. TV   commercials are currently bought based on C3, which measures the viewership of   commercial minutes within a program viewed live and within three days of air.   Some advertisers already resist paying for commercial viewing beyond the   airdate of the commercial they bought, and media buyers are likely to resist   moving to a seven-day metric.
 When asked about the possibility of considering C7, one top buyer frowned and   barked, "no comment."
