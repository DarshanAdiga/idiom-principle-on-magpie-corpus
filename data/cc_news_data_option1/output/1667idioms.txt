STEVENS PASS — Between overcrowding and sweeping closures due to the coronavirus outbreak, the 2019-20 ski season was a bust for skiers who bought season passes only to use them a handful of times — if they were used at all.
 Now, Vail Resorts, the parent company of Stevens Pass, among other ski areas, is addressing that situation, crediting 2019-20 season pass holders according to a tiered system based on skiers and snowboarders' actual pass usage for the season. The company is also implementing a new pass insurance program for the upcoming ski season that will refund passes in the event of closures like the ones seen this year.
 The new policies were shared Monday on the company's website in a statement and letter to pass-holders from Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Kirsten Lynch.
 Lynch said that after Vail's staff had "spent weeks" reading emails and social media posts from pass holders, the company came up with a tiered approach to crediting customers for lost ski time, basing credit amounts on the number of days each pass was used.

 TRIPOLI, Lebanon (Reuters) - Protests against growing economic hardship erupted in Tripoli and spread to other Lebanese cities on Tuesday, with banks set ablaze after a night of rioting that left one demonstrator dead, according to security and medical sources.
 A collapse in the currency, soaring inflation and spiralling unemployment are convulsing Lebanon, in deep financial crisis since October. A shutdown to fight the new coronavirus has made matters worse for the economy.
 Protesters in Tripoli set two banks on fire and smashed their facades, prompting the army to deploy and dozens of soldiers to take position in a street lined with several banks, some firing rubber bullets and tear gas.
 Riots that began a night earlier and which set several other banks and an army vehicle on fire in the city ended with the death of a man in his 20s, according to a security source who said it was not immediately clear who was responsible for his death.
 Later on Tuesday protesters in the southern city of Sidon chanting "revolution" hurled petrol bombs at a central bank building, setting its exterior on fire before smashing the fronts of several banks.
 In Beirut dozens marched across the city, some wearing medical masks while chanting against the financial system and shouting for more Lebanese to join. Later, crowds hurled stones toward security forces positioned in front of the central bank.
 The unrest threatens to tip the country back into violence even as Beirut looks to pass an economic rescue plan and enter negotiations with foreign creditors after defaulting on its hefty debt obligations last month.
 Prime Minister Hassan Diab urged Lebanese to refrain from violence and said "malicious intentions behind the scenes" were "shaking stability".
 "We are faced with a new reality, a reality that the social and living crisis has made worse at record speed, especially with the rise of the U.S. dollar exchange rate to record levels on the black market," Diab said in a statement.
 Lebanon's pound has lost more than half its value since October and slid sharply over the past week, triggering small protests despite a coronavirus lockdown and pleas by officials for people to remain home.
 U.S. dollars sold for 4,200 Lebanese pounds on Tuesday according to one importer, despite a central bank directive capping the price at 3,200. Several currency dealers were arrested on Monday for violating the cap, prompting their trade association to announce an open-ended strike.
 In a phone call to Diab, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Paris was ready to convene an international support group meeting for Lebanon as soon as coronavirus lockdown measures were lifted.
 Diab's government, formed in January with the support of the powerful Iran- backed Hezbollah, has struggled to enact reforms demanded by foreign donors to release billions of dollars in pledged financing.
 "People have lost their purchasing power and the state has no plan to do anything. Banks are closed and not giving money to people. I think this government should resign," said Tripoli lawyer Fahed Moukaddem.
 Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad said after a Cabinet meeting that "final touches" were being put to the rescue plan, a draft of which this month estimated losses in the banking sector at $83 billion.
 WARNING
 Tripoli, a port city 80 km (50 miles) north of Beirut and long dogged by poverty and unemployment, was the stage for protests against Lebanon's ruling elite last October.
 "This is not a riot, this is expressing (anger) that the dollar has reached 4,000 Lebanese pounds. ... How are people going to eat? And this is the holy month of Ramadan," said Abou Hussein, a Tripoli activist.
 The army said a firebomb was thrown at one of its vehicles and a hand grenade hurled at a patrol. It blamed "infiltrators" and called on peaceful protesters to leave the streets.
 It said 40 soldiers were wounded in Tripoli and elsewhere after patrols sent to reopen roads were attacked with stones. Three banks and several ATMs in Tripoli were burned overnight and nine protesters arrested, a statement said.
 A statement from the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said: "The frustration of the Lebanese people over the economic crisis is understandable, and the demands of protesters are justified. But incidents of violence, threats, and destruction of property are deeply concerning, and must stop."
 The U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jan Kubis, said the violence was a warning for Lebanon's political leaders.
 "This is the time to provide material support to increasingly desperate, impoverished and hungry majority of Lebanese all around the country," he wrote in a tweet.
 The banking association declared all banks in Tripoli shut until security is restored. Only a handful of branches have been open during the coronavirus lockdown.
 Banks have been a target of savers angered by being frozen out of their deposits. One each in the southern cities of Sidon and Tyre were attacked on Saturday and Sunday.

 PRAGUE (Reuters) - The mayor of one of the Czech capital's districts said on Tuesday he had been put under police protection due to a threat that a Russian man had been sent to kill him, escalating a row between Prague and Moscow.
 Mayor Ondrej Kolar of Prague 6 irked Russia in recent months after his district removed a statue of Soviet World War Two commander Marshal Ivan Konev from a square.
 That prompted criminal investigation by Russian authorities who saw it as an insult. Prague said such investigation of elected representatives was unacceptable.
 "I can really only tell you that I have been given police protection. It was provided to me on the basis of certain realities ... that there is Russian man here whose task is to liquidate me," Kolar said in an audio recording played on Prima television.
 Kolar's comments followed reports in Czech news outlets - the weekly Respekt and the online daily Denikn.cz - that tied police protection of Kolar and the city of Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib to the arrival of a Russian man carrying a diplomatic passport in early April, seen by security services as a threat, the media said.
 Reuters could not verify the media reports, based on unnamed sources.
 Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday the country would not allow interference in its politics.
 "It is impossible - if true - for some foreign country to take some actions here against our citizens," Babis told a televised news conference.
 Both Prague 6 and the city of Prague confirmed on Monday Kolar and Hrib were under police protection.
 Kolar said Hrib was also a target as well as mayor Pavel Novotny of another Prague district, Reporyje.
 A spokesman for the Prague city hall declined to comment on the reasons for the protection for Hrib on Monday, citing a police decision.
 The city council led by Hrib in February renamed a square outside the Russian embassy in honor of murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov.
 The counter-intelligence agency BIS refused to comment on the media reports on Monday. Police declined to comment.
 The Czech Foreign Ministry said a Russian diplomat accredited in Prague did return several weeks ago from a business trip and was picked up by colleagues at the airport.
 "It looks like another hoax," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday when asked about the Respekt report.
 The Russian embassy in Prague protested the Respekt report in a statement on Monday and did not respond to Reuters questions on Tuesday.
