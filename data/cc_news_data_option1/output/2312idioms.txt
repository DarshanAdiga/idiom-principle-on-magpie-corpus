Throughout its 90-plus year history, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has often been criticized for not awarding the best film of the year with the best picture Oscar. For example, in 1941, "How Green Was My Valley" beat out a field that included "The Maltese Falcon," "Suspicion" and "Citizen Kane." How poor was that decision?
 But the Academy does get things right, and more often than you'd think. Case in point, it actually awarded this year's best film, "Parasite," with the Oscar, though a few folks didn't agree. So how often does the Academy do the right thing? Let's look back 50 years and see. Part one ran last month. Part two runs this month.

Evelyn has been named the Reading Eagle's 2020 Berks' Best winner in communications.
 While most of her writing these days is for school assignments, Evelyn said she'll sometimes spend a "lazy Saturday" typing out whatever is "rolling around in her brain." She said she finds the process rewarding.
 "I like the self-expression, being able to communicate," she said of the craft. "I love how clear you can be with writing, how precise you can be with writing. But you can also be extremely vague with it and allow the reader to take their own ideas out of it."
 Evelyn said she has an idea already percolating for her first book, saying she want's to write something that she'd like to read. She said she has long had a fascination with loneliness and isolation, and has been working on an idea about being alone in outer space.
 "Just knowing that there's no one around you, what would you do?" she said. "It would be about being alone but not necessarily being lonely. I think it would be some sort of escapism."
 Along with reading and writing, Evelyn has a passion for dance. She has danced at Rhythm and Motion for the past seven years, teaching there as well the past three.
 She also enjoys singing, taking part in the annual school musical, and her job working at Pop's Malt Shop.
 After high school Evelyn plans on attending college, however where that will be is up in the air. She said the COVID-19 pandemic has left her "reassessing everything."
