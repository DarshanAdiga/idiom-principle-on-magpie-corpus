_Legends of Runeterra_ apresentou hoje algumas grandes novidades, incluindo seu primeiro modo de jogo depois da Contenda, os Laboratórios, na atualização 1.5, e o primeiro grande evento nas atualizações 1.6 e 1.7.
 Com os Laboratórios, os jogadores podem usar a criatividade com os experimentos e extrapolações, e até mesmo um pouco de caos, do modo mais casual. Toda atualização depois da 1.5 passará a incluir um Laboratório novo ou atualizado para substituir o anterior. A Riot Games pode usar a experimentação dos Laboratórios para fazer pequenas alterações à fórmula de _LoR_ , ou até mesmo alterações extremas, criando novos modos ou mudanças completas aos fundamentos do jogo.
 O primeiro dos Laboratórios será chamado A.R.A.M. e seu lançamento está marcado para a atualização 1.5, em 8 de julho. Neste Laboratório, haverá confrontos inusitados entre Campeões e jogadas imprevisíveis. Em vez da construção padrão de decks, os jogadores vão precisar escolher entre alguns Campeões aleatórios no início de cada partida. Os Campeões que você decidir recrutar começam na sua mão e são a base de um deck aleatório construído automaticamente. Para o seu oponente, funciona da mesma forma.
 A Riot também anunciou alguns outros detalhes dos eventos já mencionados, que chegam a _LoR_ em julho. O primeiro evento de _LoR_ será uma experiência temática de um mês no novo Laboratório, com missões especiais, itens personalizados e mais. Apesar de o tema exato ainda não ter sido revelado, haverá prévias especiais antes do lançamento oficial do evento, com a atualização 1.6.
 Os jogadores que participarem do evento receberão como recompensa alguns itens de tempo limitado que poderão ser desbloqueados gratuitamente só por jogar. Com o evento, também virá um Passe de Evento que poderá ser comprado na loja e dará ainda mais recompensas só por jogar. O evento continua até o fim da atualização 1.7, que também traz um novo Laboratório e uma mudança no formato da Contenda.
 Hoje também foram anunciados outros ajustes e mudanças ao jogo, incluindo o desafio entre amigos de blocos diferentes, que entra na atualização 1.6. Isso vai facilitar o jogo entre regiões e abrir caminho para um ecossistema competitivo global. A outra grande melhoria da atualização 1.7 é que os jogadores finalmente poderão escolher que ilustração de carta vai representar cada um de seus decks na montagem de decks.
 Os Laboratórios chegam a _LoR_ em 8 de julho com a atualização 1.5, e os eventos entram no jogo na atualização 1.6.

The unique characters and environments are the work of cartoonist Jesse Jacobs, which I recognized instantly. I'm a big fan of his work Crawl Space, which has an equally psychedelic touch as the cover features a grinning face with a third eye exploding into color. The rainbows were bar none my favorite aspect of Spinch as well as the bizarre grinning characters. I was disappointed that the Spinches themselves weren't as inventive-looking, but I suppose the white character did end up standing out among the rainbows elsewhere.

Honestly, I'm not particularly good at Spinch, but I enjoyed playing it. There were two frustrating jumps I just couldn't get myself to make, and I was irritated beyond belief since they seemed like such simple movements to make. But as soon as I stepped away from the demo to take a moment and work on something else for a little while, I soon found myself drawn to the game once more. When I tried the jumps again, I was able to clear them with no problems. I imagine that, for many, Spinch will have that same sort of allure.

Flexibility has become a focus at linebacker for the Iowa football team.
 With the Hawkeyes' shift to a blend of defensive looks, morphing from the program’s traditional 4-3 alignment to a 4-2-5 arrangement more frequently over the past two seasons, the usage and roles of linebackers have changed.
 But, the primary objective of stopping the run first against any opponent has remained at the core of Iowa’s belief system.
 “There may only be two linebackers on the field at a time, so it is more competitive, but at the end of the day it comes down to doing your job wherever you are lining up,’’ linebacker Djimon Colbert said last season.

Like the Reed City Brewing Company, VanLeeuwen said with the outside and indoor seating, it's almost as if they're at full capacity.
 "We're doing great right now," VanLeeuwen said. "Everything is working out really well. Our sales numbers continue to go up. I think people are cautiously relieved and glad to be out and supporting local businesses."
 VanLeeuwen said she's found that running the inside of the restaurant at 50% capacity is more efficient, cleaner and less congested than running at 100%. She's even considering keeping capacity levels at 50% after the state allows restaurants to serve more people.
 She said to-go orders have tripled since the Stay Home, Stay Safe order was issued. They now have an employee who takes the orders full time, which frees up the bartender from having to take the orders.
 Although they've shifted employee roles a bit to fill new responsibilities at the Taphouse, VanLeeuwen said they're currently at the same staffing levels as they were prior to the shutdown.
 For some mom and pop shops, the COVID-19 crisis provided an opportunity to grow their online busines and deliveries.
 Herb and Terry Cottier, owners of Heart to Heart Floral in downtown Cadillac, specialized in delivery of their products even before the shutdown but Terry said the service was even more appreciated when people were confined to their homes.
 Terry said their Mother's Day sales were much higher this year than a typical year.
 "We were delivering love," Terry said. "We were delivering smiles. People were so surprised and happy."
 Herb said a big aspect of their business — providing flowers for funerals — didn't shrink as a result of funeral homes no longer being able to host large events. Rather, many people chose to hold get-togethers at their homes.
 In the month of May alone, Herb said their online sales exceeded 100 orders.
 Terry said she didn't come into the shop during the peak of the coronavirus crisis but now feels more comfortable working. She said the biggest drawback of the pandemic, from her point of view, is the lack of physical contact between people.
 "I always say, it takes 10 hugs a day to stay healthy," Terry said. "The only thing that I've been missing is my hugs every day."
 According to a recent government report, American shoppers ramped up their spending on store purchases by a record 17.7% from April to May.
 Consumers' retail purchases have retraced some of the record-setting month-to- month plunges of March (8.3%) and April (14.7%) as businesses have increasingly reopened. Still, the pandemic’s damage to retailers remains severe, with purchases down 6.1% from a year ago.
 Nearly 80% of small retailers and restaurants nationwide tracked by the scheduling tool Homebase that were closed in mid-April have since reopened.

Brown said she was approached by Lakers chief operating officer Tim Harris, who had reached out to UCLA for guidance. Brown asked Harris if the Lakers were a “non-racist” or an “anti-racist” organization.
 “I was super happy when Tim responded, ’You know what, we hadn’t necessarily thought about it in those terms, but I can say that we are aspirationally anti-racist,'” Brown said. “I got really excited by that, because in that statement, there was so much that recognizes that there is this aspiration, but it’s a process to get there."
 The Lakers' moves to take an active role in pursuing social justice are ardently supported by owner Jeanie Buss, who used her Instagram account Friday to share a photograph of a racist, hateful letter she received recently, hoping to impress the urgency of anti-racist action on her followers.
 “Why don’t you look in the mirror and see your ugliness, because I refuse to,” Buss responded to the letter-writer. “I have received letters like this over the years. The advice I always got? ‘Ignore it.’ I did. But not anymore.”
 Brown expects to work primarily with the Lakers' employees more frequently than their players or coaches, and she participated in a group call with employees Thursday.

The arrest followed an April 1 head-on crash in a construction area west of Cedar Rapids that killed 43-year-old Dawn Elaine Stout, who was driving east. Wagehoft was driving a westbound vehicle and was ejected by the crash. He was found trapped under a vehicle. Two passengers in Wagehoft’s vehicle also were injured.

CADILLAC — The COVID-19 pandemic has hit home for many people. Economic hardship has fallen on millions of families as unemployment numbers skyrocket. Churches and other places of worship have closed, and many people have not seen their loved ones in months. With this in mind, the Cadillac Seventh-day Adventist Church’s youth in collaborating with Feeding America decided to help by providing a free, contactless food giveaway on June 8, 2020.
 Feeding America, as a partner in this endeavor, provided over 10,000 pounds of an assortment of produce and dairy products for this event. Boxed up and ready to go, this allowed the food to simply be placed in people’s cars by volunteers wearing masks reducing risk. Recipients of the food were overjoyed. Smiling, happy faces as they saw the food loaded in their vehicles. “This gives me hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.‘ said one person. “This is helpful to the community in a time of crisis,‘ replied Dave, another person who received food.
 But the food was not the only thing that compelled people to partake in the giveaway. Earlier in the event, not as many people as expected were showing up to the event. Several youth volunteers made a sign and waved them by the roadside. This compelled many people to receive much-needed assistance. “Thank the kids for standing by the street. I would not have stopped if it were not for them!‘ exclaimed one person.

The most impactful was Mason Greenwood and Paul Pogba entering for the final half hour. It was Pogba who cut in and Eric Dier felt bundling him over was the only option. From the penalty spot, Bruno Fernandes netted to recover a 1-1 draw in the emptiest of venues since the English Premier League resumed this week during the pandemic — the 62,000-capacity Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.
 It was Pogba's first appearance since Dec. 26. The three-month break in the league due to the coronavirus allowed the French World Cup winner to recover from surgery.
 The need to pack in fixtures to complete the league by July 26 means teams are allowed five — rather than three — changes inside 90 minutes. It was a decision by the league, Mourinho claimed, advanced by the “powerful clubs."
 Just before Fernandes' 81st-minute leveler, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær also sent on Nemanja Matic and Odion Ighalo — a striker originally signed due to the Chinese league being halted in January in the country where COVID-19 originated.
 For good measure, Solskjær introduced Eric Bailly in the 89th to complete the five changes.
 “With the five subs I thought we are able to finish the game strongly,” Solskjær said. “We had quality players to come on and make a difference.”
 Mourinho's only changes in the 70th minute saw Gedson Fernandes and Giovani Lo Celso sent on.
 “I had some tired people on the pitch,” Mourinho said, “without options to change them.”
 United's comeback extended Tottenham's frustrating run from before the shutdown — a time when only one point from three games had been collected and Mourinho publicly wished for it to be the summer already.
 “In that period we had zero attacking options," Mourinho said, “and now we had four.”
 But still not enough.

Those who propose abolishing the police are shortsighted, and thankfully few. Others who propose “defunding,” when they really mean “reforming,” hurt their cause with verbiage that seems to focus on money rather than attitudes and cultures.
 It is true that many law enforcement agencies have become increasingly “militarized” over the last couple of decades, with armaments and equipment more typically found on a battlefield than in a police precinct. With that inventory in hand, it is easy for a more aggressive mindset to permeate police operations. You don’t need an armored Humvee for community police work.
 It is hard to implement a meaningful refocusing of law enforcement when politics are interwoven into every decision. Professional policing strategies should not be held hostage by the whims of a Republican vs. Democrat debate, the re-election plans of a mayor or governor, or the need for a district attorney to curry favor by rushing forth with criminal charges against an officer before an investigation is complete.
 The nation’s military is the best in the world at what it does. It is not designed for the task of domestic law enforcement.
 Many police officers need more training to do their jobs well. Data from the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police compiled in 2017 showed the hours of training required for certification of officers in the state was well below the national average and among the lowest in the Southeast. Better training could help when a violent situation needs de-escalation, when a mental health patient needs help, when peaceful protesters fill the streets, when entire communities teeter on the brink of explosive rebellion.
 “Defunding” is a notion without validity, but we do need to find ways to reallocate funds so as to pay police officers, and many others in public service, more for what they do. The job placement service ZipRecruiter says lower end salaries for law enforcement in Georgia start at under $30,000. While our starting salaries are higher locally, if you know a police officer, odds are he or she works a second job to make ends meet. Better salaries would mean better job applicants, more stability and less financial pressure, not just for police officers but also for social workers, firefighters, EMTs and others who play a vital role in our society.

"We have doing well. People have been cleaning out their closets and bringing me some adorable pieces."
 Ramsey said it's been a bit of an adjustment adhering to social distance protocols such as keeping customers six feet apart but she's making it work.
 "People have been understanding so that also helps," Ramsey said. "I'm just grateful to be open."
 While foot traffic into the business has been somewhat erratic, with some days bringing in no customers and others being extremely busy, Ramsey said she thinks more and more people will be out and about as the summer months approach.
 "I think people want life to return to normal," Ramsey said.
 Kevin Murphy, owner of Reed City Brewing Company, said they're doing "really good" right now.
 "I can't complain," Murphy said. "I'm not saying the shutdown didn't hurt us, because it did ... but even during the shutdown, our clientele was picking up. Delivery jumped up quite a bit and carry-out has never been higher."
 While Murphy believes the increase in delivery and carry-out orders will plateau at some point, he thinks it will remain higher than it was pre- pandemic because now more people are aware they offer the service.
 Restaurants and bars currently are allowed to only be at 50% capacity, but Murphy said he's able to make up for that loss in customers by opening up an outdoor section for seating.
 With both the outdoor and indoor sections open, Murphy said it's essentially like they're able to run at full capacity.
 It isn't all good news, however.
 Murphy said two of his biggest crowd drawers — live bands and stand-up comedians — won't be possible this year.
 "We have been doing those a couple nights a month and the place fills right up," Murphy said. "The way we have to move the tables around (to comply with social distancing requirements), we just can't do it."
 Another restaurant that has taken advantage of outdoor seating is the Lake City Taphouse.
 Owner Sylvia VanLeeuwen said they repurposed an outside patio area which formerly wasn't being used as a place to serve customers. She said a lot of people, particularly those who come from outside the area, feel more comfortable eating outside than they do inside.

GAS CITY — For a little more than a decade, a race track – somewhere – has served as a second home for the Pretorius family.
 Zack Pretorius, a 17-year old soon-to-be senior at Madison-Grant, estimates he was five when made his first venture to a track with his parents Jeff and Kandi Pretorius.
 The Pretorius family took their young son to the New Castle Motorsports Park to watch go-kart racing, and young Zack was instantly smitten with the sport.
 “My dad bought a kart before i was born, worked with a guy that had a cart and decided gonna do it himself,” shared Zack Pretorius at Gas City I-69 Speedway on Wednesday. “He bought a kart then I was born and he never got around to it.
 “We would go to New Castle Motorsports Park and watch races when I was younger and as soon as I was old enough, I wanted to to get in a kart.” he continued. “We got one and we’ve been racing for about 10 years now, so we decided to jump into this and see what we can do.”
 The “this” that Zack speaks of is the world of sprint car racing. A much different world than go karts, and in some respects, it’s like completely starting over as a racer.
 But it’s the natural progression in the racing realm. Drivers are always looking for ways to go faster no matter the level of competition.
 Zack’s go-kart career was stellar: He won nine championships from 2014 to 2019, earned several Driver of the Year awards and was the 2017 Yamaha Junior National Runner-up among many other accomplishments.
 The experience Zack Pretorius gained in kart racing came with multiple levels of importance for the young man who spends his winters playing basketball for the Argylls.
 “I had a lot of fun,” Zack said. “I met a lot of great people and made a lot of friends that I’m sure I’ll have for the rest of my life. I would say we were relatively successful.”
 With a distinguished resume in kart racing, the Pretorius family started discussing what the next step in Zack’s racing career should be.
 Building a career on the race track is neither easy or cheap, but the ability Zack had shown in go karts started the exploration process.
 “Basically we started looking at what we could afford to do,” said Kandi Pretorius as she sat trackside Wednesday waiting for Zack to hit the quarter- mile dirt track. “We sent him out to California to see if he would even like dirt (racing). He’s raced on asphalt and road courses his whole life.
 “We sent him to a sprint car school out there and he called me as soon as he got out of the car. He was hooked. That was it.”
 Zack Pretorius ran in two sprint car races at Gas City Speedway last summer driving for Goodnight Racing. The experience only further cemented his desire to take the full-time step into a sprinter.
 Over the winter, the Pretorius family got their own sprint car and started preparing it for Wednesday night, opening night at Gas City with a jam-packed grandstand and some of the best open wheel drivers in the world in attendance.
 The sprint car races were the under-card to USAC’s Indiana Midget Week Show at Gas City, and other than two practice sessions in his car, it was the first experience for Zack Pretorius in his own sprint car.
 Oak Motors is Zack’s primary sponsor. The company’s president is Jeff Pretorius, who also happens to be Zack’s crew chief.
 The challenge of learning how to race a sprint car isn’t just for the driver.
 “It’s certainly been a challenge for sure. You go from go karts, you race on pavement, there’s no shocks the track doesn’t change. You find the line and everything’s the same,” Jeff Pretorius said. “There’s no racing really in my family tree forever so we’re the first trying to do it. We have a lot of support with Scott Benic, with Goodnight Racing so we lean on them quite a bit.
 “I just ask a lot of questions, do what they suggest that I do and I put it in (Zack’s) hands and let him try to figure it out,” he added. “That’s kind of how we started in go karts and how we’re doing it in this.”
 Zack said his goals for opening night were pretty simple. Keep moving forward and try to stay out of trouble.
 “Right now I think it’s just about being consistent, keeping everything in one piece and just having fun as well,” Zack said. “Try to get better as I go on.”
 Opening night proved to be somewhat successful and highly educational for team Pretorius. Zack’s ran a fast lap of 13.210 seconds in hot laps then finished sixth in a heat race that featured national sprint stars, CJ Leary and Brady Bacon.
 Zack Pretorius has a couple close calls but no major incidents on the night. He drove through part of turn one during his heat race with both his left-side wheels high off the track, but safely got all four back on the dirt and continued on. His night ended in the B-main with a minor spin on the final lap in turn four and a ninth-place finish to miss qualifying for the feature.
 It was all part of the learning curve that comes along with all forms of auto racing. Zack still has big aspirations for the summer at Gas City, where he’ll race full time this season.
 “Right now it’s just trying to dip our toe in and see what it’s like,” Zack said. “I really would like to start winning races, hopefully towards the end of the season, but if not, definitely by the mid-part of next year.”
 Zack said his goal is to eventually get good enough to race for a living. He said it didn’t matter too much what series, be it dirt-track open wheel cars, stock cars, Indy cars or any other form of car that has four wheels and the ability to go fast.
 The summer of 2020 is the next first step in Zack’s pursuit of racing for a living.
 “He’s got the passion for it and drive for it and just really wants to succeed,” Jeff Pretorius said. “We’re just trying to provide him the opportunity to be successful and trying to make it a family environment. I chalk it up to making memories. We have a limited time with our kids so we’re just trying to enjoy the time that we have.”
 Kandi Pretorius was briefly moved to tears when asked about watching her son follow his heart and chase after his dreams. Being a racer’s mom comes with a whole different set of emotions than the ones experience by her husband and son, but its obvious she loves sitting trackside and watching Zack race.
 “He’s got so much courage and so much determination to come out here and figure this out,” Kandi said of Zack. “He was able to do that in the go kart world. I think it’s hard for him to start over but he’s a student of the sport and he just works and works and works because he wants it.
 “I really want him to find his way. He’s going to be a senior this year and I want him to find that thing that makes him happy and brings him joy,” Kandi added. “If it’s racing I just hope and pray those opportunities present themselves. If it’s something else then I just want him to be successful and happy. ... last year he came out to one of the Gas City races just to watch, he said something like ‘This is what my soul needs.’ Race tracks are his happy place.”

Founded in 1942, the Voice of America was never meant to be a megaphone for the American government. The concept was the opposite: A federally funded broadcaster would showcase American values around the world by offering unbiased news and a true picture of American life. That mission is enshrined in what the VOA calls its "firewall," which "prohibits interference by any U.S. government official in the objective, independent reporting of news."
   
 So it's worrisome that the Senate confirmation of the Trump administration's pick to head the VOA and several allied broadcasters was followed by the resignations of the two top VOA executives, both experienced, respected and independent journalists.
   
 The people who listen to the news service around the world -- more than 280 million in 40 languages and on every media platform -- are, for the most part, people who can't abide the propaganda of their rulers and turn to the world's premier democracy to hear the truth. If they thought VOA was also feeding them propaganda, they'd change the station, and probably their image of the United States.
      
 The value of such journalism should be self-evident to any believer in the value of a free press. It is not to President Donald Trump nor to his erstwhile strategist Steve Bannon. It was Bannon, then head of the far-right website Breitbart, who more than two years ago tried to put his man, Michael Pack, at the helm of VOA. But the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, first under Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and Trump critic, and then under the more Trump-friendly Jim Risch of Idaho, was in no rush to confirm Pack until something prodded Trump to launch an attack on VOA two months ago.
   
 In its evening newsletter then, the White House blasted the service under the headline "Amid a Pandemic, Voice of America Spends Your Money to Promote Foreign Propaganda." The crime, as described by Dan Scavino, Trump's social media director, was positive reports on how China had handled its coronavirus outbreak. Trump promptly picked up the chorus. "If you heard what's coming out of the Voice of America, it's disgusting," he told a White House news briefing April 15. "What things they say are disgusting toward our country. And Michael Pack would get in and do a great job."
   
 What evidently rankled the White House was a clip showing people celebrating the lifting of the lockdown in Wuhan, which accompanied a straightforward account by The Associated Press. VOA officials were dumbfounded. "It just came out of the blue," said Amanda Bennett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning veteran of Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and The Philadelphia Inquirer, who announced her resignation Monday as director of the VOA. The deputy director, Sandy Sugawara, formerly of The Washington Post and United Press International, also resigned.
   
 Bennett and Sugawara did not link their departures to the long-delayed confirmation of Pack, who becomes head of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the parent organization of the VOA, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and some regional foreign broadcasters. In her farewell message, Bennett assured VOA staffers that "Michael Pack swore before Congress to respect and honor the firewall that guarantees VOA's independence, which in turn plays the single most important role in the stunning trust our audiences around the world have in us."
   
 It may be that Pack will respect the firewall he is sworn to maintain. His past is patchy -- he hired Bannon, an icon of the alt-right, as a consultant on two documentaries, including one about Adm. Hyman Rickover. He is also under investigation by the District of Columbia attorney general for possibly channeling money from a nonprofit group he oversees to his for-profit film production company. And he was confirmed along party lines. Before that, he had worked at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Council on the Humanities and served as president of the conservative Claremont Institute.
   
 None of that confirms that if left to his own judgment, Pack would do Trump's or Bannon's bidding, especially if it meant flouting the VOA's legally mandated independence. What is certain, given Trump's record and his statements about VOA, is that this is what the administration expects and will forcefully demand. Trump wants a bullhorn, not a diplomatic instrument, and he insists on loyalty.
   
 The specter of turning VOA into a propaganda tool of the White House should be frightening to all Americans, regardless of political leanings. America's image abroad has already been battered under this administration, making an independent global broadcaster all the more essential as a voice of the integrity and fairness that are still at the core of American values.
   
 The responsibility of the senators who confirmed Pack is not over. It is their duty to ensure that he does not violate the oath he took.

A Riot Games anunciou hoje que haverá grandes mudanças no nível mais alto das ranqueadas de _Legends of Runeterra_ quando a atualização 1.4 for ao ar, em 26 de junho.
 Antes apenas uma pequena prévia no anúncio “O que vem por aí em Runeterra”, no fim de maio, as mudanças exatas do tier Mestre trazem mais certeza aos jogadores em relação ao que esperar depois de uma vitória ou derrota. Com as coisas como estão, as classificações atuais dos jogadores do Mestre são feitas com base no MMR exato dos jogadores. A principal desvantagem disso é que, ao entrar na fila para jogar, não se sabe quanto é possível ganhar ou perder em uma mesma partida. Além disso, as derrotas costumam punir muito mais do que se ganha com as vitórias.
 Outro ponto negativo do sistema atual é que os jogadores que chegaram antes à colocação podem ficar estagnados no topo, mesmo jogando poucas partidas. Tudo isso fazia com que ficasse mais e mais difícil alcançar as posições mais altas.
 Com o novo sistema, será preciso ver a quantidade de PdL do Mestre que se tem para descobrir sua colocação exata. Ao entrar no Mestre pela primeira vez, os jogadores recebem "uma quantidade de PdL inicial com base na posição do seu MMR em relação a outros jogadores nesse tier", segundo a Riot. Ao alcançar o Mestre, os ganhos e perdas de PdL serão determinados por uma combinação de fatores: seu MMR, o MMR do oponente e quantos PdL você tem em comparação a outros jogadores do Mestre. Os valores vão de 15 a 25 PdL, o que permite que os jogadores entendam melhor quanto podem esperar ganhar ou perder por vez ao entrar em partidas.
 As melhorias ao tier Mestre e outras novidades chegam a _LoR_ com a atualização 1.4, em 26 de junho.

During its regularly scheduled meeting last week the Booneville School Board approved a school improvement plan which including an expectation of provided blended learning in the fall.
   
 Superintendent Trent Goff said he would be bringing a comprehensive plan for the 2020-2021 school year for the board to examine when it meets on July 14.
   
 Board member Eric Jones asked if Goff had any inclination as to what it might look like to which Goff answered schools have been told to "be prepared because (state officials) are worried we may have to pivot back and forth."
   
 Goff said he had also, earlier that day, obtained a first estimate for personal protective equipment (PPE) and was somewhat taken aback by the amount.
   
 Goff said the school district has also consulted parents of students at each building and found an overwhelming number of of them who want everything "as normal as possible."
   
 In the event that doesn't happen the school board also approved the purchase of 300 new Chrome Book devices which will be placed at the high school with existing still usable devices "trickling down" through the junior high and elementary school, Goff said.
   
 At that point, the superintendent said, the school will have enough of the devices for "one-to-one" coverage for all students from third grade through seniors.
   
 "We may come back with a bid for tablets for K-2 next month," Goff added.
   
 On Thursday, during Governor Asa Hutchinson's daily press briefing, state officials revealed a plan that allows flexibility for learning in the event of an interruption as well as encouraging school districts to seek input from teachers, parents, students and the community in crafting local plans.
   
 The return to campus discussion followed an election of board officers for the coming year in which Todd Tatum moved from vice president to president, Tyson Washburn from secretary to vice president, and Bobby Haynes becoming the secretary.
   
 Tatum replaces Andy Napier as the board president.
   
 While the school improvement plan can be adapted at any time the district had to pass a plan before the end of June, according to superintendent Trent Goff.
   
 Goff said the plan is largely a duplication of last year's plan.
   
 Booneville High School Principal Amy Goers said that's because a lot of the goals established in the plan for last year could not be measured because the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic cause closure of school the final nine weeks, wiping out standardized testing.
   
 In other matters the board approved a resolution which states the school will observe any state directives when they conflict with school board approved policy.
   
 Goff also told the board the remodel of the new administration building is on schedule with walls painted, Wi-Fi being set up and flooring expected to be completed by the end of next week and a move from the current building across from the elementary school shortly thereafter.

Amid the changes in everyone's lives over the past few months, Boys & Girls Club of South Logan County has adapted to meet the challenge.
   
 By spring break, it was likely that plans for a typical spring and summer would be much different than had been experienced before. Board members and staff would soon begin work on their determination of how the Club could still be viable and helpful to the young people of the Booneville and Magazine communities.
   
 Boys & Girls Clubs across Arkansas would be doing the same.
   
 The phrase "monitor and adjust" has long been used in youth development work whether in a school situation or youth organization. It's a part of the everyday work. This time, it would mean a whole lot more.
   
 Board members and staff will be the first to acknowledge that the success of the local Club over the past 19 years has been dependent on the partnerships that have been cultivated and have grown in the South Logan County area. This has been an anchor and lifeline since the beginning.
   
 These partnerships have helped to provide stability and sustainability for the work of the organization. Involved and dedicated individuals, local businesses, civic organizations, faith-based organizations, local city and county government, both school districts in the southern region of the county, and service-oriented agencies such as United Way of Fort Smith Area have all played a vital part in the diverse resource stream that has enabled the Club to continue its services and meet needs for its young people.
   
 In recent years, this resource stream has included expanded funding from state government, AEP Foundation grant program, and the partnership with United Way.
   
 Now, it's the year 2020. It's a different time, to say the least. They will also acknowledge that opportunities abound to challenge them to see the world in a different way - to help young people see the world in a different way.
   
 As the Club determined what function it would play in these times, it considered what "monitoring and adjusting" would become necessary. First, annual fundraising events would have to be postponed or canceled.
   
 What would have been the 19th Annual Celebration Banquet was first postponed, and then canceled. The event that has pulled our community together in commitment and thankfulness for years, the Mayor's Prayer Breakfast, would also be canceled. The 19th Annual Benefit Golf Tournament would be postponed for a later time in May.
   
 As for operations, Club staff would experiment with what could become a new norm for many, virtual programming; the concern for an ever-present food insecurity among our children would provide a major opportunity of work for the Club; communicating with members would be discussed in order to keep staff and young people connected.
   
 To prepare Club staff for the time when members once again would enter the facilities on a daily basis, hours of training for programming and safety protocol would need to be conducted. For the kids, programming would have to include good daily hygiene, social distancing, learning how to "keep your hands to yourself" more than ever before.
   
 Limitations would be determined on how many members could be safely and effectively served at the Club sites in Booneville and Magazine. Then, there would be the determination of the effect of all of this on budget.
   
 The exciting part in spite of the challenges was the encouragement and support from the partnerships that have arisen to the occasion for the Club's ongoing services - services that look different from other times in the past. Even though the Club's part-time staff had to be furloughed for two weeks, they were quickly called back through approval of a Paycheck Protection Program loan in early April.
   
 When they returned, numerous phone calls were made, many letters were written and read and answered through the Pen-Pal project, activity bags were prepared and distributed, and a large amount of program planning and preparation were accomplished.
   
 An Arkansas Economic Development Commission "Ready for Business" grant has provided funding for personal protective equipment, sanitizing and cleaning supplies and equipment, restocking of programming supplies, and other needs that will become necessary through the coming months.
   
 Rockline Industries has given an in-kind donation of 100 canisters of disinfecting wipes to assist the Club with daily sanitization procedures.
   
 Through grants received from the Arkansas Community Foundation COVID-19 Relief Fund, United Way of Fort Smith Area's COVID-19 Response Fund, Kiwanis Club, Lion's Club, Rotary Club, as well as donations from faith-based organizations, businesses and individuals, as well as an in-kind donation of over 28,600 snack food items from the Community Services Clearinghouse in partnership with United Way of Fort Smith Area, the Club has prepared and distributed almost 4,200 snack bags to children in Magazine and Booneville.
   
 They have also begun including extra snacks for weekends in 1,425 of those bags as a result of the in-kind donation. This work will continue as long as needed.
   
 In May, the board of directors and staff finalized a plan and voted to open the Club in Booneville and Magazine to children age 6 to 12 whose parents had been able to return to work but still needed assistance with having a safe place during the day for their children.
   
 Through support from the Booneville and Magazine school districts and their respective summer food programs, the Main Club site opened on June 1 to a maximum of 50 members, and the Magazine Elementary School site opened on June 8 to a maximum of 20 members. As of the time of this report, both sites are currently at approximately 50 percent of capacity.
   
 Executive Director, Rick Scott, says that "This has been good. It has given the staff a chance to test our plans, set a routine for the kids, and practice their protocol for safety procedures, sanitization and cleaning."
   
 Even with limited attendance this summer, staff still have planned numerous activities and programs. Their special programming for the summer, "Summer of Wellness" supported by a mini-grant from the Blue & You Foundation, will present "Health, Hygiene, & Happiness," "Team Emergency," "No Way! Know the Way!" "Be NetSmartz" and "Safe & Secure Patrol."
   
 For the Club's vital fundraising events, their 19th Annual Benefit Golf Tournament did occur on May 23 and 24 after two postponements,. Event organizers reported that it was a big success for the Club and that everyone followed guidelines and course rules.
   
 In the coming week, people driving on Highway 10 between Booneville and Magazine will again see the familiar yellow and red tent planned to be located in the parking lot of the National Guard Armory. That tent has been the center for hundreds of hours of volunteer help and fundraising activity for many years. It is a major source of support for the Boys & Girls Club of South Logan County.
   
 At this time, it is believed that the annual Bean Dinner and Pie Auction will still be held in November. These events and the generosity of its partners and donors are means of support that are necessary to sustain the non-profit organization in the South Logan County area.
   
 The Club invites you to find out more about its day-to-day activities by visiting its website, www.bgcslc.org, or its Facebook pages. You are also invited to speak with them about how you can become a financial supporter of the organization by calling Rick Scott at 675-2764, or by speaking to one of the Club's board members.
