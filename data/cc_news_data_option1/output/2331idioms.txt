First off, be sure to include keywords in your LinkedIn profile. Why? Because plenty of employers turn to LinkedIn to fill vacancies. Often they search by job title, and designers want to make sure their name appears in the search results. In addition, users can track who has viewed their profile. If a user that viewed your profile looks like a hot prospect, take the initiative to reach out, contact them, and send a message. Don't be too afraid to start a dialogue.

RANDOLPH -- Though outdoor restaurants and retail establishments have gotten the OK to slowly resume operations, large-capacity venues like Lombardo's in Randolph are still weeks, if not months, away from being allowed to reopen. Rather than sit and wait for an uncertain future, the Lombardo's team decided to pivot their services with a new marketplace and drive-in theater that will allow them to serve the community and, they hope, survive.
 "We've spent the first two months of the COVID-19 crisis really focused on giving back and preparing meals for healthcare and front line workers," David Lombardo, general manager, said. "As that started to wind down, we said 'We've been cooking well, let's see if the general public would gravitate towards that.'"
 Lombardo says this pandemic has been "devastating" for the hospitality industry. The event hall been closed since March 16 as gatherings of over 10 people continue to be banned.
 The marketplace, an online shop where people can order fresh produce, homemade sausages, prepared meals and cocktail kits, has been in the works for about a month.
 "We're very passionate about cooking and food and taking care of the community," he said, adding that Lombardo's started with a family butcher shop in 1927. "Let's go back to our roots and get back to where we started."
 Customers have until noon on Wednesdays to order for a contactless pick-up on Friday at the front of the venue.
 As for the drive-in movie theater, Lombardo expects that to launch by June 25, pending approval from the town.
 He says about 100 to 140 cars will be able to fit in the parking lot for family-friendly double-features that will be projected on the white wall of the building. Tickets can be ordered online, as can concessions like hot dogs, popcorn, candy and soda, which will be delivered to the car safely.
 "We think its a great opportunity for families to be able to get out and enjoy something outside home but still remain safe," he said.
 They are hoping to make the drive-in theater a weekly event, if not more, and also use the projecting capabilities to host other events, be they graduation celebrations or reunions where they can project montage videos.
 "I encourage everyone to go out and support local restaurants as they begin to reopen," Lombardo said. "We've all been working really hard to provide a safe environment. Without their support, we're in a lot of trouble."

One of the problems with this code is that if you have two tabs in your browser pointing to the same page, posting one will invalidate the token of the other, since they're using the same session token key. This can be addressed by adding a token ID which will make sure each request-response sequence happening in one tab will use its own set of unique tokens and will not interfere with other requests on the same page. The first order of business is to go back to the TokenizedPage class and add a TokenID property. This property generates a random ID the first time it is called in the initial GET request and stores it in the ViewState collection for future reuse.

Marriott, Hilton and other big hotel companies are used to competing on price or perks. Now they are competing on cleanliness.
 From masked clerks at the front desk to shuttered buffets, hotels are making visible changes in the wake of the pandemic. Signs will tout new cleaning regimens: Red Roof Inns promise "RediClean," while Hilton boasts of "CleanStay with Lysol."
 Hotels are still mostly empty; in the United States, occupancy stood at 37% the week ending May 30, down 43% from the same period a year ago, according to STR, a data and consulting firm. But leisure travel is starting to pick up, and hotels see cleaning standards as a way to soothe jittery guests -- and possibly win back business from rivals like home-sharing companies like Airbnb.
 "I think, more than ever, customers are going to be looking for that seal of approval," said Phil Cordell, Hilton's head of global new brand development, who is leading the group developing the company's new cleaning standards.
 Some hotel brands are more stringent than others, says Larry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University. He notes that Accor Hotels, a French company, has developed accreditation standards that its hotels must meet in order to reopen.
 But Yu said enhanced cleaning is happening everywhere.
 "Everybody is doing it, because it is now expected by consumers," he said.
 Guests are already seeing differences. David Whitesock, the chief innovation officer for Face It Together, an addiction counseling company, moved from Denver to upstate New York over Memorial Day weekend. He stayed at Marriott hotels in Iowa and Ohio along the way.
 There were some oddities. Police tape separated him from the front desk in Iowa, and the hotel gave him a key card even though he would have preferred to unlock his room door using Marriott's app. Whitesock brought his own food, but noticed prepackaged breakfasts laid out where buffets used to be.
 But he said his rooms looked, felt and smelled cleaner than they used to. All the guests wore masks and respectfully kept their distance, he said.
 "I felt like it was a safe place to be, that they had done the best that they possibly could given the circumstances," Whitesock said. "A lot of it comes down to, do you trust the hotels and the people who you are going to come into contact with there?"
 Despite hotels' precautions, however, visiting them is still risky, said Dr. Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health. Hotels can bring together travelers from states or countries where transmission rates are higher, for example, and many carriers may not be showing symptoms.
 "That's the kind of thing we're worried about in terms of public health," he said. "Those settings can be the cause of outbreaks."
 Hilton and other companies have called in experts to develop new standards. Marriott and IHG -- the parent company of Holiday Inn -- are working with EcoLab, which makes industrial cleaning products. IHG is also getting advice from the Cleveland Clinic. Hilton has partnered with the Mayo Clinic. Hyatt is working with ISSA, a global cleaning industry association.
 Hotels walked through the guest experience and made changes at every touch point. Hilton's hotel shuttles will be disinfected hourly and passengers will have access to wipes. MGM Resorts, which is reopening four Las Vegas hotels on June 4, will ask restaurant guests to view digital menus on their own phones.
 Changes vary by hotel. Guests may find lobby furniture moved further apart or hand sanitizer stations next to elevator keys. Shared coffee stations are gone. DoubleTree still offers warm chocolate chip cookies, but only upon request.
 Inside the rooms, surfaces like TV remotes and light switches will get an extra cleaning. Best Western is getting rid of decorative pillows, pens and other unnecessary items. Red Roof is telling staff to bag up dirty sheets inside its rooms, to limit spread of disease. Once a room is cleaned and disinfected, Hilton will put a sticker on the door so guests know no one has been inside.
 Ko said in addition to disinfecting surfaces, hotels might want to consider moving dining outside, where the risk of transmission is lower, or limiting capacity in tight spaces like elevators. Marriott's plan includes limiting capacity in restaurants and gyms and ensuring people are distanced in elevator lines.
 Cordell said Hilton plans to keep pools and fitness centers open and clean them regularly.
 "Fitness and wellness is so fundamental to the guests getting back in their routine," he said.
 Hotels are experimenting with new technology. Marriott and others are using electrostatic sprayers to spritz lobbies with disinfectant. Many hotel brands are also encouraging guests to access their rooms using their mobile phones. Hilton says 4,800 of its 6,100 hotels have that capability so far. Marriott offers keyless check-in in 3,200 hotels.
 Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky thinks guests will prefer separate homes to hotels filled with people. Airbnb -- which is also working with EcoLab and former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy -- will continue to upgrade its cleaning protocols, he said.
 "Health and cleanliness are going to be one of our biggest focuses," he said.
 But Yu said hotel chains can ensure franchisees are complying through their normal auditing process. That will be a challenge for Airbnb, he said, which has developed its own cleaning standards but may have more trouble ensuring that hosts comply.

Providing an alternative is also proving to be a challenge for those who can't use the train services. So far, BEST buses have been ferrying passengers. BEST is currently running 2,557 vehicles, 80% of their total capacity. This is being ramped up gradually with an addition of nearly 200 more buses expected to be up and running in the next two days.

I am certain that many of the protesters who attended the large rallies for social justice in Washington, D.C., are Redskins fans. I would encourage them to use social media and urge the ownership to change the name. Root hard for your team, but refuse to wear anything bearing the Redskins name or logo. Long overdue, the Cleveland Indians finally got rid of the garish Chief Wahoo logo after the 2018 season. Of note, 70% of players in the NFL are African American. Visiting the Redskins website, one encounters articles about how head coach Ron Rivera and several players plan to fight social injustice. It is incongruous to wear the Redskins name on your jersey while doing so.
 NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell recently issued an apology from the NFL that it was wrong for not listening to its players and discouraging peaceful protest. I would also encourage Mr. Snyder to get on the proper side of history. He can be remembered as the owner who had the courage to do the right thing. Art Modell changed the franchise name for our now-Baltimore Ravens, allowing the Cleveland Browns to keep their name and history. Perhaps the football gods will be kind and reward Mr. Snyder with a Super Bowl championship or two as the team’s last such win was in 1992. From a purely economic standpoint, imagine all the revenue that the Washington football franchise can make selling new branded merchandise. It is wrong that a sports franchise representing our nation’s capital bears such a divisive and insensitive moniker.

Unless your co- founder(s) say something completely crazy or off-script, don't correct them, and even then, really think about it before speaking up.

Sullivan introduced a system of high-intensity defense, most often involving double-digit players every game to either smother or wear down opponents while creating easy scoring opportunities down the other end of the court.
 The new style caught on quickly and achieving success came from the first year, when the Tanners broke their drought and made the tournament, even winning a first round game.
 The next year, 2010-11, saw Woburn finish with its best regular season ever at 18-2. This record was even more amazing considering the Tanners star guard at the time, Katy Knight, missed 14 games due to injury.
 This was also the period where the Tanners and Reading would go toe-to-toe in must-watch games twice a season. The Lady Rockets would win a D-2 state title in 2012, no doubt, helped along by the battles they had with Woburn.
 Playing in Div. 1 North didn’t bode well at that time for Woburn as it was defeated by Lowell, 56-49, in a first round game.
 Woburn was unable to get out of the quarters over the next two years, until finally breaking through the 2013-14 season, when the Tanners also won the first of their five straight titles. Woburn won two games before falling to top seed and eventual champion, Lynn English.
 The Tanners had their best regular season of the decade in 2014-15, going 19-1, only to go down in the first round, as the top seed, to an Arlington team that it defeated twice during the regular season, but had only lost to Woburn by two points in the final regular-season meeting.
 Woburn put it altogether in the 2015-16 season, earning its third straight ML Liberty title and capturing the Div. 1 North title as the second seed, defeating fourth seed Revere for a trip to the TD Garden. The Tanners lost to Bishop Feehan, but it was a season of unprecedented triumphs for Woburn.
 Point guard Marissa Gattuso was a constant through these Liberty title years. Now playing at Merrimack, she rounded out her career with a league MVP season while leading the Tanners to a third trip to the semifinals, and second straight trip to the North final. Woburn lost to Andover in the final, but it was not the end of the Tanners’ successes.
 Woburn tied Belmont for the league title for the second year in a row, and fifth straight title overall in the 2017-18 season. The Lady Marauders gained control of the series with a quarterfinal victory at Burlington’s Vanella Gym.
 Belmont ended the Tanner’s title streak in the final season of the decade, and then ousted Woburn again in the quarterfinals, this time at the newly-named Coach Lyons Court at Wenner Field House.
 Sullivan wanted no part of selecting the All-Decade (2010-19), but assisted the _Daily Times Chronicle_ by graciously giving us a list of 18 players from throughout the 10 years with which to create the team.

Army delegations from India and China on Monday held discussions along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh to break the stalemate that began with a confrontation between rival patrol parties near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6, two senior officers said on the condition of anonymity.
 The talks took place at two locations along the LAC -- brigadier-ranked officers met in the Galwan area and Colonel-ranked officers in Hot Springs -- as part of continuing efforts to resolve the standoff, said the first officer cited above.
 "The talks were positive and frank. As long as talks are happening, we are moving towards a solution," said the second officer cited above.
 Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane last week said disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces was taking place in a "phased manner" along the LAC where the situation was "under control".
   
   
 India and China are continuing diplomatic and military engagements for an early resolution of the standoff between border troops, the external affairs ministry said last week. Naravane said on Saturday he was hopeful that perceived differences between India and China would be put to rest through the continued dialogue.
 Army delegations, led by major general-ranked officers, met for the fifth time last week in eastern Ladakh to resolve the standoff.
 Limited disengagement of forces at Galwan Valley, Patrolling Point 15 and Hot Springs began after a meeting between Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the People's Liberation Army in South Xinjiang region, on June 6.
 India is now focused on resolving the situation on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the ongoing border scrap and where troops are still locked in a face-off.
 Last month's violent confrontations between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh and north Sikkim triggered a military buildup on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.
 The Chinese buildup began immediately after clashes between border troops in Ladakh and Sikkim on May 5-6 and May 9, respectively, and predated the June 6 meeting between Lieutenant General Singh and his Chinese counterpart.

The Pablo Center at the Confluence will host its first Broadway production and rescheduled dates for performances that had been canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic as part of its upcoming season.
 The downtown Eau Claire arts center released its third season schedule on Monday morning, featuring national and regional performers who will play for their first time at the Pablo as well as local groups and perennial favorites returning to the facility’s stages.
 Bringing a production that played on Broadway has been a goal of the center since its inception and that will come true with the performance of the musical “Waitress” scheduled for March 24. The musical is an adaptation of the 2007 film of the same name about an expert pie-making waitress who pines for a way out of her small town and bad marriage.
 One of the shows canceled this spring — a three performance run by “Stomp” that was nearly all sold out — has been rescheduled for next season. The eight-member troupe of “Stomp” will perform their percussive music using everyday objects including brooms, wooden dowels, garbage cans and hubcaps on March 26, 27 and 28.
 Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis, storied big band group Glenn Miller Orchestra and Herman’s Hermits are among musicians booked for the upcoming season. Musical tributes to Neil Diamond, Patsy Cline, Steely Dan and Aretha Franklin are also part of the season’s lineup.
 The schedule released Monday has performances starting in October and wrapping up in June, but the Pablo Center has not yet reopened. The performing arts venue closed to the public on March 13, just prior to government orders curtailing large gatherings as a precaution to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 Executive Director Jason Jon Anderson included a note of optimism in the third season announcement that the facility could soon reopen when public health officials say it is safe to do so.
 “We are excited to open the galleries, theatres and building when allowed indoor event capacities increase and physical-distancing requirements are minimized,” he stated. “On behalf of the entire core staff, we are looking forward to hosting you, hopefully in October, and presenting you with our incredible third season.”
 The center’s season is scheduled to begin on Oct. 2 with three musical performances. Chicago-based quintet Third Coast Percussion will take the stage in the large RCU Theatre, while the Chippewa Valley Jazz Orchestra will play music of Duke Ellington in the Jamf Theatre, and UW-Eau Claire music faculty will present wartime chamber music in the Clearwater Recital Hall.
 Local author and musician Michael Perry will perform with his band The Long Beds on Oct. 3 in the Jamf Theatre.
 Regional favorites Them Coulee Boys and Vic Ferrari have shows planned in November, followed by country singer Chris Kroeze in December.
 Pianist Lori Line will perform her perennial holiday show in late November during the same weekend as another recurring event, the Found Footage Festival.
 The Frontmen of Country — a trio of singers who led country acts Lonestar, Restless Heart and Little Texas during the ‘90s — will perform on Jan. 8.
 The Simon & Garfunkel Story chronicles the rise and split of the musical duo in an immersive concert-style theater show on Jan. 30 in the RCU Theatre.
 Los Angeles based dance company Diavolo will perform Feb. 10 in the RCU Theatre.
 Making the Music — three award-winning composers sharing their songs and stories — will be presented on Feb. 11 in the RCU Theatre.
 Improv comedy show “Whose Live Anyway?” will invent scenes using audience suggestions on May 23 in the RCU Theatre.
 The season’s schedule also includes many performances from local theatre troupes, school music ensembles and other groups comprised of area residents.
 Tickets to season three performances go on sale to the general public on July 27. People who support the arts center through a membership are able to buy tickets at earlier dates in July.
