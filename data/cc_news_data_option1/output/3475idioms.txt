“The KBE’s Aug. 28 meeting was not designed to override the decision of the Board of Control,” the letter stated. “This was clear by the limited items included on the agenda for the KBE’s special meeting. Furthermore, the benefit of athletics to students is not up for debate. The KBE recognizes the physical, social and emotional benefits of school sports. Providing our students with athletic opportunities and competition benefits not only their physical health, but also provides a social outlet, teaches our students the value of teamwork, and creates a place where many students find lifelong friends and mentors.
 “The meeting was called for the KBE, as the principal in charge of interscholastic athletics, to review the decision of its agent and to gather a better understanding of the information considered by the Board of Control when it made the decision to move forward with fall sports. As the KBE and KHSAA have recognized for decades, the health and safety of student athletes must be at the forefront of any decision regarding school sports.”
 The items that the KBE put forth for action from the KHSAA BOC are as follows:
 • Develop guidance for school districts on the responsibility and authority to enforce the protocols set forth in the recent KSHAA guidance document. Specifically, this new guidance should address the consequences for failure to follow KHSAA guidance, including how sports programs will be suspended or penalized for their failure to follow the guidance and ensure the safety of student athletes. Just as the rules of play are uniform and enforceable, so should be the rules for the protection of student athletes in light of COVID-19.

Boskalis Subsea Services, a subsidiary of the Dutch marine services giant Boskalis, on Monday said it had completed work on a North Sea pipeline as part of a "multi-million-pound" contract awarded to it by Perenco.      The Aberdeen-based company mobilized the dive support vessel (DSV) the Boka Da Vinci,  to replace a 29-meter section of the pipeline which delivers hydrocarbons from the NW Bell field to the Bessemer Platform, in the Southern North Sea.
 The hydrocarbons are then delivered to the Bacton Gas terminal in Norfolk via the Inde Field for processing and onward distribution to the National Grid1.
 The DSV and 100 crew on board were mobilized from Great Yarmouth Port to the pipeline's location, 78km east of the Lincolnshire coast, in the company's first saturation diving project with Perenco.
 The Boka Da Vinci is equipped with two bells for saturation diving work up to a depth of 300metres and accommodation for up to 120 people. It also has a 140t active heave compensated main crane, and 1,120m3 of available main deck space with a load capacity of 3,300t.
 Following a detailed analysis and successful testing of Magma Global's flexible M-Pipe technology, Boskalis applied rigid spool methods to transport the replacement pipe solution.
 The vessel also shipped a mechanical connector from Connector Subsea Solutions, as well as equipment to carry out testing, flushing and cutting services.
 The campaign included dimensional surveys, dredging, and concrete mattress removal, storage and re-positioning activities. The work was supported by personnel from IKM Testing to carry out barrier testing and flushing services, and specialists from Claxton Engineering to prepare, cut and remove the existing steel pipe before Magma's M-pipe is installed.

 The training certification process teaches hosts about new CDC sanitation standards, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Listings which have opted into the Enhanced Clean program see, on average, about three times more bookings than those which do not.
