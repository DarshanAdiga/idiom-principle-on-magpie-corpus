Maddox said it takes about two hours for him and his wife, a teacher at Nichols Elementary School in Oceanside, to write new lyrics for a song. The experience has proved to be a big bonus for the couple, who have a 12-year-old son named Ryder.
 “I’ve never found ways to creatively collaborate with her before. I’m a bit of a diva and am very exacting. But she’s really good at this,” he said. “We work hard to write really good lyrics. It’s not just fart jokes and low-hanging fruit. I come up with basic concept and ideas. She helps me refine it. It’s a great A-B collaboration.”
 Since launching the new video series online (facebook.com/chrismaddoxlives), Maddox said his viewership and shares have skyrocketed. He has been profiled on CBS News 8 locally and the national TV magazine “Inside Edition” is also working on a feature.
 Maddox is now working on new songs from different genres, as well as collaborations with other tribute artists. And he’s been using the videos to promote the Belly Up’s new downloadable concert service, bellyuplive.com, which is helping the club pay its bills during the shutdown.
 One of the best things to come out of The Crisis Crooner is that, for the first time, Maddox is singing songs to an appreciative audience without a rhinestone jumpsuit, $700 wig and sideburns and bedazzled sunglasses. He hopes that even after the coronavirus crisis ends, people will still want to hear Maddox perform as himself.
 “To sing in my voice and my face is super gratifying and fun,” he said. “There’s a much greater emotional connection with people because they can see your eyes. I’d love it if the world demanded I come out of the closet and sing all kinds of songs. I want to be the San Diego Chicken for our times, spreading joy through music and humor.”

"This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity—for example, speaking, coughing, or sneezing—even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms," according to CDC guidelines announced Friday. "In light of this new evidence, CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission."

In a video on the CDC’s website posted Friday, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said that cloth face coverings can be made from an old scarf, bandanas and hand towels, and showed how to fashion a face covering from a t-shirt and two rubber bands. Adams has also urged people to wash their hands before putting on a mask, to avoid buying medical grade or N95 masks so that they can go straight to health professionals on the front line and to continue social distancing even if wearing a mask.
