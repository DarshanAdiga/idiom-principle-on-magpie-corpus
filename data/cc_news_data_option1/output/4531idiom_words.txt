Anton Du Beke has swerved rumours of becoming the fourth judge on Strictly Come Dancing.


  The 54-year-old professional and his partner Jacqui Smith were the first to be given the boot over the weekend after coming bottom of the leaderboard two weeks in a row.


  On Friday he swiftly shut down the question when asked by a fan during a live Q&A session with Mirror Online.


  Fans are praying he will fill in for Bruno Tonioli who will miss the series due to working commitments in America.


  Anton has plenty of experience under his belt and he has been paired with huge celebrities over the course of his 16 years on the competition.


  But he revealed there is no plans for him to join the judging panel anytime soon.
