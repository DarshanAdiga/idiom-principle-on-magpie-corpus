 After months of search, he took the job of collecting the user fee outside the public toilets at the Pudukottai town bus stand.
 “I was doing the job for a few years and earned ₹ 200 per day, which was the only source of income for my family. Now, with the bus stand shut due to the lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemic, we were pushed into a state of penury,” he said.
 Meanwhile, a group of good Samaritans, Syed Ibrahim, S. K. Omraj, C. Harishwar and K. R. Surya, who had been mobilising funds to help out those in need during the crisis heard of Mr. Ramesh’s plight.
 “My friends who live in the same locality told us about his struggle. For the first three months of the lockdown, we gave Mr. Ramesh's family groceries, including rice, pulses and ₹ 4000, for their personal expenses,” Mr. Ibrahim said.
 As the group got to know Mr. Ramesh, they saw his will to work and realised that a more sustainable means to help them would be to help him get a job. “Using some funds, we helped him set up a vegetable stall near the Pudukottai town fish market,” Mr. Ibrahim said. Mr. Ramesh began selling fruits and vegetables from the stall since Saturday.
 These days, Mr. Ramesh wakes up early in the morning and, along with his mother, goes to the market to purchase fruits and vegetables for his shop. They then reach their spot by 7 a.m. and get ready for the day’s sales. “On weekends, we make at least ₹500. At a time like this, we are grateful to be able to eat three meals a day,” he said.
 Mr. Ibrahim and his friends also installed a basket in Mr. Ramesh’s retrofitted vehicle to help him transport large quantities of vegetables daily.
 “We are now looking to mobilise some more funds to rent a shop for them to have a permanent location for the vegetable shop,” he said.

SCITUATE -- A new committee set on helping Scituate's small businesses weather the COVID-19 storm has wrapped up the first week of its "Scituate Loves Local Box" initiative -- and members say it went off without a hitch.
 "We sold out. They went pretty quickly, and I have a feeling they're going to go even quicker as we keep going," Emily Shea, spokesperson for the Scituate Loves Local committee, said.
 The Scituate Loves Local committee launched a town-wide campaign in May to encourage residents to shop at nearby businesses. For the last several weeks, the committee has been actively featuring different stores on social media and highlighting unique restaurants, gift shops and liquor stores. Last month, committee member Brenda O'Connor had the idea to take things one step further: gift boxes.
 Using its small budget, the committee plans to buy gift cards and treats from local small businesses, then sell them in a bundle to residents. The first week's bundle (technically they come in a reusable bag, not a box) was sponsored by the Scituate/West Cork Sister City Committee and featured Irish- themed items. Each bag costs $50 and contains $90 worth of local goods.
 The bags were filled with eight items, including a $25 gift card to The Voyage restaurant, a $15 gift card to Snappy's Packie, a "Luck of the Irish" scratch ticket, a Scituate/West Pint glass and a crowd-sourced cookbook with recipes like T.K.O. Malley's Guinness beef stew and Mullaney's crab cakes.

 "It supports local businesses through our purchases but also gives people an opportunity to try new restaurants or find goods from local shops," Shea said. "Scituate is great because of all these local small businesses, but obviously right now it's a huge concern. . . People need to be spending money in town and we hope to inspire people and show how easy it is to support local."
 The bags can be ordered by emailing scituateloveslocal@gmail.com or by visiting Scituate Loves Local on Facebook. Only 25 of each bag will be sold. The next bag will be sponsored by the Scituate Beach Association, and the Scituate/Sucy-en-Brie Sister City Committee is also slated to sponsor one.
 Once the bags are ready to be picked up, customers grab them at whichever local business is that week's designated pick up spot.
 The first bags were picked up at Board 143, a new shop in North Scituate. The rotating pick-up spots give businesses a chance to attract new customers, Shea said.
 "We've only been in business for a month and a lot of people didn't know about us before this," Kerri Curreri, owner of Board 143 said. "So we've been able to get the word out. People were shopping while they were here, it's been great."
 Curreri and her husband Mark run the small shop, which sells local food, wine, beer and charcuterie. Shelves are stocked with beer from Scituate, salt from Duxbury, dog treats from Weymouth and other South Shore-centric items.
 "That was really important to us," Mark Curreri said of buying local. "And people seem receptive to it. They like being able to come in here and say 'I know where that comes from.' It's been fun."
 Shea said that while Scituate Loves Local was born out of the need to help small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, they hope to someday transition the committee -- and www.seescituate.com -- into a group that focuses on driving tourism.

The logistics: the batter in the order that precedes the batter due up in the next inning will start at second base. That player can be substituted for a different player -- perhaps a speedster that can, in theory, put an end to the game on a bouncing bloop single. Official scorers will record the runner on as an error -- but, no error will actually be charged. That keeps the pitcher free of an earned run mark on his stat line.

The other significant consequence of the pandemic was the reduction in treatment facility populations and limited admission. State health restrictions and government intervention, along with social distancing, reduced treatment options for addicts.
 Treatment centers across the nation have had to turn people away. As the restrictions begin to ease and states take steps to restart the economy, the reality of the increase in deaths of despair will start to hit home. These are deaths that are associated with mental health and economic factors and related drug and alcohol use.
 In a report published by Well Being Trust; Peterson, Steve, et al. 2020, more Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair because of the COVID-19 recession.
 The opioid epidemic was already a national crisis; however, the numbers from the past few years indicated it had tapered off. Most people who became addicted to opioids became hooked through taking a prescription. Although, it has been a variety of opioids from pain medication, heroin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl.
 In early March, when many of the lockdowns were taking place, counties began to see an uptick in overdose and emergency calls related to opioids. The presence of fentanyl in cocaine had a significant role in this. However, current opioid users were using alone and had nowhere to reach out to for help. Overall, the people who were already vulnerable were made even more vulnerable due to the pandemic.

"Germany has -- they really owe a lot of money in NATO, and this has been going on for many years," Trump said at the press conference. "When you add it all up, you're probably getting close to a trillion dollars. And that's not treating NATO fairly, but it really isn't treating the United States fairly," he continued. "And I would imagine [Berlin would] like to wait until after the election so that maybe they could deal with somebody other than President Trump. But after the election, they'll just have to pay more."
 Beyond the spat over military spending, Trump has extended this talk of "unfairness" and "bad treatment" to Germany's trade policy in other comments on the troop movements. The result is an impression of vindictiveness more than strategy.
 That's unfortunate, because the strategic case for US departure is strong: Germany -- like other European countries -- is a wealthy, powerful nation perfectly capable of taking responsibility for its own defense. US troops should be withdrawn from Europe not -- as Trump thinks -- as punishment, but rather as an overdue shift of American foreign policy toward realism and restraint (and encouraging European defense policy toward self-reliance).
