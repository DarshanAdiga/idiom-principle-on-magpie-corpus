Dec 23 (Reuters) - Asset managers Owl Rock Capital Group and Dyal Capital Partners on Wednesday agreed to merge and go public through Altimar Acquisition Corp, a blank-check company.


  The combined company, to be known as Blue Owl Capital Inc, would be valued at about $12.5 billion managing over $45 billion in assets and will list on the NYSE after close of the deal first half of 2021.


  The deal is expected to provide about $1.8 billion in gross proceeds, of which $275 million will be provided by Altimar through cash held in a trust and $1.5 billion will come from investors, including ICONIW Capital, CH Investment Partners and Liberty Mutual Investments among others.


  Altimar, which is a special purpose acquisition company, raised $250 million in its IPO in October this year.


  A SPAC is a shell company which raises funds in an IPO with the aim of acquiring a private company, which then becomes public as result of the merger.


  SPACs have emerged as one of Wall Street¬¥s most popular investment vehicles in 2020, with over 200 SPACs raising more than $70 billion.

In mid-December, Nancy Grace shared that she and her entire family tested positive for COVID-19. She also said that her 89-year-old mother, Elizabeth, was hospitalized following her positive diagnosis. Thankfully, Grace revealed to the _Daily Mail_ that her mother has subsequently been released from the hospital and is currently on the mend.


  Grace told the _Daily Mail_ about her mother's release from the hospital, "This truly is a Christmas miracle! My mother turned 89 in the Covid ward and just got home for Christmas! Thank you for your prayers. They have been answered and I will be forever grateful." She went on to share her appreciation for the medical staff who helped treat her mother during her stay in the hospital. She added, "I'd like to thank all of the wonderful staff at the Northside Hospital in Atlanta who took such wonderful care of mother and nursed her back to health. Northside Hospital is a special place for our family as it's where my twins were born, and now it will be known as the place that saved my mother."


  Grace originally told the _Daily Mail_ that her mother was tested for COVID-19 on Dec. 4 after she experienced symptoms relating to the illness including lethargy, loss of appetite, and coughing. Elizabeth, who lives with the family in Atlanta, was later rushed to the emergency room for treatment. Grace was later informed on Dec. 7 that she, her husband David Linch, and their 13-year-old twins John David and Lucy Elizabeth, also tested positive for the illness. She told the publication that she tested positive for COVID-19 after she experienced flu-like symptoms and came down with a cough. Grace noted that her two children had sore throats and that her husband dealt with a severe headache. While her mother was recovering in the hospital, Grace, Linch, and their children quarantined at their home as they dealt with their own diagnoses.


  The former prosecutor said that the family's positive COVID-19 tests came as a shock, as she thought that she had done "everything right" in order to keep herself and her loved ones safe. She explained, "COVID is no joke -- we thought we had done everything right. Please keep wearing masks, social distancing and stay safe - no family should go through this." Grace also issued her gratitude to the medical professionals who were treating Elizabeth, saying that they were "taking such wonderful care of her."

Forsyth was eager to highlight the fun and festive day, sharing a gallery of images from the festivities with her 1 million Instagram followers. Along with photos of the Duggar grandkids and some present opening, she also shared a photo of the girls holding up the wreathes they had decorated. The image seemed suspicious for some, who noted the way in which Seewald held her wreath so that it covered her torso, quickly prompting pregnancy speculation.


  In the comments section, which quickly filled with a flurry of speculation, one person said Seewald "is definitely pregnant and hiding it," something several others seemed to agree with. Another _Counting On_ fan, also taking note of the way in which the mom of thee held the wreath, questions, "is Jessa pregnant? Interesting placement of the wreath." Somebody else candidly wrote, "Jessa's preggo," a comment which received numerous replies of agreement.


  0comments


  Not everyone was on board with the rumors, though, noting that Seewald was not the only one to hold the wreath in front of her torso. Many noted that almost all of the Duggar women held their wreaths at belly-level. Others simply said it was not fans' place to make such assumptions, and that "if she announces she is... then she is. Is she doesn't then she's not."


  Seewald, who is also mom to sons Spurgeon, 4, and Henry, 3, has been at the center of such rumors numerous times in the time since welcoming little Ivy. Over the summer, after fan speculation erupted yet again, she quickly shut down the rumors, replying to one fan who asked if she would soon be announcing a fourth pregnancy, "there's no baby behind the bump -- only tacos. Thanks for asking."

Spenrath closed the first quarter with a dunk, cementing El Campo‚Äôs dominance early. Leading 25-7, with nine seconds left El Campo drove the length of the court after a Bay City made free throw. At the three-point line, freshman La‚ÄôDarian Lewis passed to Spenrath at the free-throw. With three seconds left, Spenrath pump-faked, drawing the Bay City defender to jump. Spenrath ran past him and threw down a two-handed dunk as time expired in the quarter.


  The Ricebird senior post finished one rebound shy of a double-double, picking up 25 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in two-quarters of work.


  Bay City opened the third quarter with back-to-back threes to pull within 10 points. After an El Campo turnover, Bay City scored on a short jumper to make it 39-31, the closest they‚Äôd get Monday.


  Spenrath scored on a putback and sophomore guard Rueben Owens II connected on a three after a Blackcat turnover to extend El Campo‚Äôs lead to 13 points. The Ricebirds closed the quarter on an 18-3 run.


  Lewis worked with both the bench and the starters Monday. The freshmen filled the stat sheet with 11 points, eight steals, six assists and four rebounds. The bench did not score much, contributing 12 points, but the playing time was valuable.


  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really worried about (the starters), I just want to get the whole group better,‚Äù Lewis said. ‚ÄúWe could have put up a 100, but where would we be at the end of the day if the bench isn‚Äôt getting experience.‚Äù

_Dancing With the Stars_ wrapped up a season in November that was like none it had ever seen over its previous 28 seasons. There were new COVID-19 safety protocols put into place that left the contestants competing in an environment that featured no audience, daily testing and a lack of camaraderie among the cast due to the social distance measures. Yet, the biggest change for _Dancing With the Stars_ was with the face of the program as ABC opted to cut ties with Tom Bergeron despite being the host of the show since its inception in 2005. Cheryl Burke, who has been a professional dancer on the series for more than 20 seasons, was surprised to see the news of his departure.


  The two-time mirrorball champion, who was recently inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame, called Bergeron "an icon" and said just like her most recent achievement, that "he should be inducted into some sort of Hall of Fame." She recalled growing up watching Bergeron as the host of _America 's Funniest Home Videos_ and how he always presented himself in such a relatable manner. "His voice, there's something so comforting about his voice," Burke told PopCulture.com over the phone. "You know that he's always going to crack jokes that are PG, maybe once in a while, PG-13. But then yet, there's such a realness to him. What you see on TV is actually what you get in person."


  Burke joined the ABC dancing competition in its second season so she was able to develop a strong bond with Bergeron over those years. So when news came over the summer that Bergeron -- along with co-host Erin Andrews -- would be let go from the show and instead replaced by Tyra Banks, Burke shared a similar sentiment to the fans in seeing the face of the series moving on. "I've always said that there is no _Dancing with the Stars_ without Tom Bergeron and Len Goodman," Burke confessed, "But, hey, clearly, the show must go on." Goodman, the show's head judge, was rarely seen throughout the season aside from a few pre-taped appearances, as pandemic-related travel restrictions prevented the 76-year-old from leaving his home in England.


  Burke explained that what Bergeron did behind the scenes, though never getting credit for being an executive producer, went above and beyond his hosting duties. "He's built this show up from the ground up," Burke admitted. Taking it a step further, Burke said that the show's success and its longevity has to do with the host, "A lot of the reason why we're still on air is because of him."
