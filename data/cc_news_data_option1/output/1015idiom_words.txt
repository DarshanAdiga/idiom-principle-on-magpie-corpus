If bows are too stiff for you, then try a curtsy? Curtsies can be described as a variant of the bow that can be used for more informal greetings. It involves bending a knee with the foot behind the other and a slight bow of the head and was initially designed as the female version of male genuflection. But since it's a pandemic, now would probably be a good time to break that little gender block.

When it comes to Portrait mode photos, the Galaxy S20 Ultra wins out thanks to that depth sensor. There's not a major difference, but the images coming from the S20 Ultra appear to be sharper and the edge detection is better. The iPhone does win out when it comes to dynamic range, and the S20 Ultra seems to have a bit of desaturation in some images, but overall, the S20 Ultra wins this category.

Apple holds patents for blood oxygen monitoring, and early prototypes of the first Apple Watch featured sensors that measured blood oxygen monitoring among other biometrics, but many of these functions never made it into the final product because of consistency issues. When the original ‌Apple Watch‌ was released back in 2015, iFixit actually discovered that Apple's heart sensors have the capability to monitor blood oxygen levels, but Apple has never activated it. It remains to be seen whether the latest incarnation of the feature will rely on new hardware in the Apple Watch Series 6 or if it will come as a software update as part of watchOS 7, both of which are expected to arrive this year. Rumors persist that sleep tracking will also be included in the next Apple Watch model.

Blood oxygen saturation naturally fluctuates throughout the day, but large variations can be linked to health issues. For example, 95-100 percent oxygen in the blood is considered normal, but a drop below that percentage could be a sign of a serious respiratory or cardiac problem.

Many state and local programs enjoy widespread support too, especially in areas like infrastructure. But few, if any, successful political leaders of the last half century have embraced expansion of government or of its role in our lives as the primary agent for change. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama experienced difficult political problems thanks to expansionary visions of government in arenas like health care and energy policy.
 Polling numbers over the decades back up this national narrative. Public trust in government was in the 75 percent to 80 percent range during the Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, and early Johnson years. However, it started a tremendous nosedive, bottoming out toward the end of Jimmy Carter's presidency at about 25 percent. Reagan restored it somewhat, to around 45 percent, but in the first George Bush and early Clinton years it descended even lower to about 20 percent. The second Clinton term and early years of the second George Bush presidency saw these numbers go above 40 percent again; however, they have never been there since.
 The Iraq War, financial meltdown, polarization during the Obama years, and now the Trump presidency have driven public faith in government all the way below 20 percent. I interpret these numbers to signal Americans are wary of big new national programs that would require a substantial expansion of the government bureaucracy or of the federal role in the economy. But none of this disproves the entire Sanders agenda.
 Changing things that can be done relatively simply, without the creation or expansion of the government bureaucracy, can still be promising and attractive ideas. These include, raising the minimum wage, changing the tax code to ask more of the rich and relatively less of the working classes, expanding the earned income tax credit, pushing affordable child care, and capping student debt burdens but not necessarily eliminating loans altogether. On these kinds of initiatives, a political leader can achieve big change without more big government. Some of them may well be worth the money, or at least some of it, that Sanders proposes to spend.
 But other parts of the Sanders agenda are much more problematic. The Green New Deal is one case in point. In trying to establish Medicare for All, Sanders would dramatically expand the federal role in the economy. Whatever the merits in principle of this idea, Americans will be very wary of that path to universal health insurance coverage. If our country makes it to Medicare for All, it will be through an evolutionary process where a public option for health insurance is created and made appealing enough that people vote with their feet over time, so to speak, thus increasingly discarding their private health insurance in favor of a potentially better system, but without having Washington rapidly and radically take over nearly 20 percent of the national economy in one easy fell swoop.
 This also suggests a path forward for unifying Democrats, particularly if Joe Biden wins the nomination and Sanders supporters feel disappointed or even abandoned. Biden can and should emphasize those issues of the Sanders agenda that do not require the unwelcome hand of Washington to play a major role in creating and administering new programs. Go big on tax rates, income inequality, minimum wage, and student loans. But also keep things simple and ensure that the federal bureaucracy will stay as small as possible throughout the process. That is a unifying national agenda that perhaps even many Republicans could support this fall.

Ampere top of the line chips consume less power, about 210 watts, than a competing Xeon CPU needing as much as 400 wats, for about the same amount of computing power — hence investors' interest in a device that could progressively supplant Intel products in tens of millions of servers around the world. Ampere shows us that the ARM architecture can yield the class of chips a Mac Pro would need. Apple, of course, designs their own custom ARM processors, but it seems at least one other company is pushing the limits of performance with the ARM architecture. Apple's custom processors have quickly ramped up in performance that is comparable to their recent Mac laptops powered by Intel processors.
