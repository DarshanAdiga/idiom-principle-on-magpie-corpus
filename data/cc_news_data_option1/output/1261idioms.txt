Reflecting on her popularity, dePaola told The Associated Press in 2013, "I think it's because she's like everybody's grandmother. She's cute, she's not pretty, she's kind of funny-looking, but she's sweet, she's understanding. And she's a little saucy, she gets a little irritated every once in a while."

“Right now, no one is kicking and screaming for help because they’re falling behind,” said Anne Germain, vice president of technical and regulatory affairs for the National Waste and Recycling Association, which represents more than 700 firms nationwide. “But we have to be ready to respond to an increase in medical waste generated by the pandemic.”
 In a world upended by the novel coronavirus, the association is asking for extensions on renewals of expired commercial driver’s licenses, greater leeway on the amount of medical waste that can be stored at treatment facilities and more flexible “hours of service” rules to provide more time to meet their customers’ demands.
 Then there’s the growing problem of hospital staffers unwilling to sign the manifests of haulers of regulated medical waste for fear of contaminating a pen and paper or digital notepad with the highly infectious virus.
 “If hospitals aren’t going to sign manifests,” Germain said, “we need a formal exemption from regulations requiring their signature on those documents.”
 That kind of flexibility is critical to “ensuring that the medical waste industry can continue to operate and deal with the potentially elevated volumes of waste that may be generated by this pandemic,” said Elise Paeffgen, a partner with the law firm Alston & Bird, who specializes in healthcare and environmental regulatory issues.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the U.S. Department of Transportation have not elevated the level of threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic.

Although both Jaemor Farms’ locations in Alto and Commerce are witnessing a drastic increase in fruit and vegetable purchases for March, Echols said sales have dropped overall by 20%.
 “We’ve seen better days, but it really hasn’t been that bad,” Echols said. “The volume of produce is up tremendously, but that doesn’t necessarily translate into money.”
 People can call Jaemor Farms to place an order for pick-up. An employee will deliver the items to the car.
 The farm’s staff will begin picking strawberries in 10 days. With the short two-month seasonal window, Echols said he’s a bit nervous about this year’s crop.
 Jaemor Farms’ biggest broker out of Atlanta is Royal Food Service, Inc, who distributes a bulk of the farm’s strawberries to restaurants and schools in Georgia. Because schools and restaurants have closed, Echols said the company asked him to look elsewhere to sell strawberries.
