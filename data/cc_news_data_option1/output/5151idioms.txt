BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia woman has been sentenced to the maximum 20 years in federal prison for conspiracy to distribute child pornography. Elizabeth Kaye Haway, 43, of Princeton, also was ordered to pay $42,900 in restitution to the victim, U.S. Attorney Mike Stuart said Monday. Haway’s sentence will start after she completes a prison term for her conviction in state court for charges including first-degree sexual assault and sexual abuse involving the same child, a girl who was 5 years old at the time, authorities said. Co-defendant Randall Peggs of Wheeling pleaded guilty to a federal child pornography charge and is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 11. Prosecutors said Haway recorded a pornographic video of the child and sent it to Peggs through social media.

Pandemia koronawirusa uniemożliwiła muzykom to, co przynosi im największe korzyści oraz dostarcza najwięcej frajdy - grania koncertów. Wszystkie trasy koncertowe zostały odwołane lub przełożone, a w 2020 roku nie odbył się żaden letni festiwal. Jedyne imprezy, które udało się zorganizować to pojedyncze, lokalne wydarzenia przepełnione obostrzeniami lub granie online.Zamknięcie i przymusowa izolacja sprawiły, że artyści mieli przez ostatni rok bardzo dużo czasu na pracę nad nowym materiałem. Powstało wiele płyt inspirowanych pandemią, ale nie tylko. Na horyzoncie widać też całkiem nowe formacje i współprace gwiazd, które być może w innych okolicznościach by nie powstały.Członkowie Foo Fighters i Pearl Jam założyli zespółWśród tego typu kolaboracji możemy wymienić projekt perkusisty Foo Fighters, Taylora Hawkinsa oraz bębniarza Soundgarden i Pearl Jam, Matta Camerona. Muzycy wykorzystali czas pandemii na tworzenie nowego materiału. Artyści wyjawili właśnie, że napisali i nagrali dwa utwory pod nazwą Nighttime Boogie Association.Nowa muzyka artystów pojawiła się na rynku za pośrednictwem ich własnej wytwórni Keep It Trippy Records. Mowa tu o dwóch kompozycjach - "Long in the Tooth" oraz "The Path You're On".Pierwsza z nich została skomponowana przez Matta Camerona, a tekst do utworu napisał Taylor Hawkins. Cameron zagrał w utworze na gitarze, basie i automacie perkusyjnym - Hawkinsa usłyszymy na wokalu, uzupełnieniach perkusji, klawiszach i innych urządzeniach perkusyjnych."The Path Your're On" z kolei to numer w całości stworzony przez Camerona, który zagrał w nim na perkusji, użyczył swojego wokalu oraz chwycił za gitarę. Hawkins wykonał tu intro perkusyjne, wsparł kolegę w śpiewaniu oraz stanął za instrumentami klawiszowymi. W utworze słyszymy też Buzza Osbourne'a oraz Stevena McDonalda z Melvins.Matt Cameron i Taylor Hawkins prezentują Nighttime Boogie AssociationW wywiadzie dla "Rolling Stone", Taylor Hawkins przyznał, że muzycy stworzyli projekt nie z przyczyn komercyjnych.Mamy w planach więcej wspólnej muzyki, ale nie są to żadne konkretne plany. Robimy to wszystko dla przyjemności. Matt i ja nie mamy zamiaru dorobić się dzięki temu projektowi wielkich rezydencji.Utworów grupy możecie posłuchać za pośrednictwem platform streamingowych, a jeden z nich trafił na oficjalny kanał kapeli na YouTubie wraz z psychodelicznym klipem.

The annual Wisconsin gun-deer-hunting season is in the books. Although I never took a shot this season, I will forever remember it for the kind and heartwarming reaction I received from many readers.
 The reaction was to a recent column I wrote about the last hunting season of 2019 that I spent with my father, Bob Hardie, who died this past summer. It seems like the bond between father and son practiced through hunting struck a chord with readers.
 Here are some of the reactions.
 Chris Dolan of New Prague, Minn., wrote about his father, James Reemts, who also died this year at the age of 85.
 “I just wanted you to know that the story you wrote regarding your father meant the world to me,” he said. “My father passed away on Oct. 14 of this year. Deer hunting was an annual tradition with he and I as well.
 When I was younger we hunted in Ottertail County, Minn., where my dad grew up — land he had hunted since his youth — and when older, when Dad could no longer manage the tough hunts in the swamps up north, on our farm east of New Prague.
 “I did not go deer hunting this year. The season was simply too close to my father’s death and it would have been a bit much to manage, emotionally. Next year, however, will find me back up north, to the land where he introduced me to the heritage, to the place we made many a wonderful memory together.
 “Thank you again for the article you took the time to write. It is just what was needed, on this end, at this point in life.”
 Jackie Pitel of La Crescent, Minn., wrote, “You have a special talent for using the things of nature to help each of us readers connect with our past. The story of Ross helping Grandpa to his hunting scene was so warm and tender. You with your dad and your conversation about the kind of tree … so preciously stated, so tender for us who have been in similar situations with aging folks. I know you miss him, but in this pandemic, I have come to know for sure our dads are in a better place.
 “Blessings to you and encouragement to keep sharing your heart.”
 Dave Ryder of Trempealeau, Wis., said my column brought back deer-hunt memories of his own father.
 “From when I was too young to hunt, listening to Dad, Grandpa and Uncle Bob tell of past hunts,” he said, “including trips to Cable and ammunition shortages during World War II.
 “I finally turned 12. Opening morning, Dad and I headed for the Black River bottoms for my first experience of actually participating with a gun. We stop at a log in the middle of dark nowhere, and he tells me to ‘sit here, and stay here until I get back.’ That was possibly the longest two hours of my life and I saw no deer.
 “Dad kept a journal of what he and Mom shot each year, and added me and eventually my brother-in-law.
 He was especially proud of the year my mom wanted a chest freezer, and he told her that if she shot a big buck he’d have to buy one. She shot a dandy 8-pointer that year. In the 1980s and 1990s, when the deer herd really populated around our area, my brother-in-law and I were harvesting multiple deer between gun and bow. Dad says, ‘You guys make it look too easy.’ And he put the journal away.
 “I could go on and on with great memories, but what brought the tears was the memory of Nov. 22, 2013. The Friday before the opener and my son’s birthday, I was at our business cleaning up that morning before going to have coffee with Dad and the fire siren went off. Shortly after a friend ran in and said ‘You better go to your parents; I think that siren was for them!’ Well it was. Dad had major heart failure, but lasted into Saturday before he expired.
 “He made it off my son’s birthday and on to opening day. I didn’t hunt a lot that season, but when I was out for the first time, I asked him that if he and Grandpa and Uncle Bob were done visiting, maybe could they try and push a buck past me. I’m guessing they had a lot to talk about.
 “Thanks again for the article and memories.”
 My deepest thanks to all of you and others who wrote or called. I’m humbled that so many of you connected with that column and with others I have written.
 We’re all traveling through this journey of life together.

Things worsened when the representation of the non-black people in the country's politics was abolished in 1950.

Roy Hodgson believes Wilfried Zaha&rsquo;s new &ldquo;selfish&rdquo; streak has helped the Crystal Palace forward boost his Selhurst Park goal tally. Zaha has already fired seven goals in 12 Premier League matches this term, while he could muster just four in the entirety of last season.And Palace boss Hodgson has hailed the Ivory Coast star for honing in on the most important elements of his craft in order to rise up the scoring charts.&ldquo;I think Wilf has come to the conclusion that if he&rsquo;s going to score more goals he needs to be a bit more selfish, he needs to be a bit more focused on just that aspect of the game,&rdquo; said Hodgson. &ldquo;And maybe that impacts on the amount of dribbling he&rsquo;s had.&ldquo;But the fact is we have a guy we rate very, very highly, we appreciate all of his skills, not least his dribbling skills.&ldquo;And I think as the years go by with the experience he gets, the more games he gets under his belt, the more he realises what are the most important things for him to do to advance his career, we&rsquo;re seeing a better and better player.&rdquo;Palace will head to West Ham on Wednesday night seeking to build on a run of three wins and a draw in their last seven league matches.Goalkeeper Vicente Guaita pulled off a string of fine saves in Sunday&rsquo;s 1-1 draw with league leaders Tottenham but was also at fault for Harry Kane&rsquo;s strike.Eagles boss Hodgson insisted he has never doubted Guaita&rsquo;s class in light of that solitary error, with the 33-year-old still the club&rsquo;s number one keeper.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been consistently good throughout my time at the club,&rdquo; said Hodgson.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid all goalkeepers are going to get a situation where the ball does something unusual like the Kane shot that swerved past him.&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s certainly made up for that many, many times over.&ldquo;His performances in my time at the club have been very, very consistent, so I&rsquo;ve never felt we need to question his ability or his place in the team.&rdquo;

This was just two weeks after he had openly suggested PSG could make a move for the Argentinian in the coming summer. &quot;What I want most of all is to play with Messi again, to be able to enjoy him once again on the pitch,&quot; Neymar said with a bright smile on his face at the Old Trafford conference room having just virtually sealed PSG's place in the UCL knockouts with a brace against Manchester United.

Roblox won't go public until early 2021, but it's hard not to like the financials from its S-1. In the last nine months, Roblox saw bookings grow by 171% to $1.2 billion. A "booking" is simply a sale that gets recognized over the lifetime of an average user, which Roblox estimates at 23 months. For most companies in the gaming space, this metric can be as relevant as revenue.

Let us now take a look at the balance sheet for AT&T. AT&T currently has 7.173 billion shares outstanding. The savings of 0.01 USD per share, therefore amount to USD 71.7 million. Extrapolated over the year, this amounts to USD 287 million. Even though it is very little of the cash flow of almost USD 28 billion that AT&T generates per year, it is within a saving of 1 percent of that cash flow.
 The bottom line is that the non-increase will change little for investors. However, the amount saved is not to be sneezed at for AT&T, even though it may seem small compared to the total cash flow. Besides, its status as a dividend aristocrat is not yet in danger, as AT&T can still increase its payout during 2021.
 ## Things I worry about
 In the current difficult economic situation, I think it is understandable that AT&T is increasing its liabilities with a dividend increase, however small it may be. Investors forget (especially in the current market environment) that investing also means sharing the business risk. And there are currently quite a few risks. It is not without reason that revenues will fall from USD 181,265 billion to an estimated USD 170 billion in 2020. EPS will also fall from USD 1.89 to USD 1.69. AT&T has bought a big chunk of possibilities and problems with Warner Media, but now this big chunk turns out to be a big problem in the COVID-19 crisis.
 The USD 85 billion deal was to make AT&T a content and distributor, unlike anything the world has seen before. However, Warner Media has tended to stagnate in recent quarters regardless of the COVID 19 crisis. COVID-19 then even worsened the situation. Revenues in the Warner sub-segment "Theatrical Product" fell from USD 1,694 billion in Q3 2018 and USD 1,375 billion in Q3 2019 to USD 1,068 billion in Q3 2020 to production stops and theater closures. The sub-segment "Television Product" also lost revenue to a comparable extent. AT&T is not responsible for this development. With the COVID-19 virus, an entrepreneurial risk has been realized that the shareholders have to share.
