Recreationists recently came out in opposition to the closure. More than 2,000 people — including about 1,260 from Gallatin County — signed an online petition requesting the road remain public. About 110 people signed a similar petition at local bike shops.
 Doug Mavor, who spearheaded the two petitions, said restricting the road during certain times was agreeable.
 “While I sympathize with the road damage they have in the spring, (the landowners’ petition) basically states the road goes to nowhere other than the property owners and it’s not necessary for transportation,” said Mavor, who often mountain bikes on Bremer Creek Road. “While I could agree with that, I think the road is also used for other reasons than getting from here to there.”
 Robert Barnaby said he has used Bremer Creek Road for decades to access land he hunts. He said he has never found the road impassable and has not seen much trash on it.
 “I think it’s a great road that the county should continue to maintain,” he said. “That’s what tax dollars are for. … It seems like it’s just, take, take, take, and pretty soon there won’t be any backcountry roads, and that’s what Montana is about.”
 The landowners on Bremer Creek Road asked the commissioners in February to abandon the road. The commissioners then created a viewing committee in March, which included Skinner and clerk and recorder Eric Semerad, to determine whether the county should close the road.
 Skinner and Semerad visited the road in June. They found the clay, dirt and gravel road had recently been graded and was wet and muddy in places.
 They recommended that the road be kept public due to its “recreational, scenic and regular public use” but that seasonal restrictions be placed on it, according to a report they submitted to commissioners.
 The commissioners ultimately heeded the recommendation.

 # Louise Carroll: Getting older is freeing
 By Louise Carroll
 For The Ledger
 I know I am getting older. I don't really need a calendar, I already know that one day comes after another and time goes on and I age. But getting older is not the same as getting old because old sounds like something permanent, where older is something in transition. I'm just not in favor of it being permanent; I prefer changing and evolving.
 There are a lot of things I am too older to do. I am too older to worry about unimportant things. That is really not because of my aging; I never was good at worrying. I have friends who could give worry lessons, but I’m too old to study worrying or how to fret over stuff. I would be willing to learn how if I could get paid for worrying. Any jobs open? I am available to worry for you.
 I've mentioned before that I love Scarlett O'Hara's "Fiddle dee dee. Tomorrow is another day." It sums up the basic truth, one day comes after another.
 In my office at the Ellwood Area Family Center, I had a sign that said, “Don’t sweat the petty stuff and don’t pet the sweaty stuff.” Or something like that. And I would often point to it when someone got in a tizzy about something that was trivial and unimportant, at least to me.
 I’m too old to worry about what tomorrow will bring. I’m just hoping that tomorrow will come and I will be here to enjoy it or muddle through it.
 I’m too old to be concerned about what I wear. I’m convinced that no one looks at me anyway except for a passing glance, so it doesn’t matter what I wear as long as it is clean and doesn’t show too much cleavage. The world could not handle that. I also plan to keep my knees covered because after having replacements in both knees, my knees could best be described as knobby with the map of the winding back road to Chewton on one and the rambling bumpy road to an undisclosed destination on the other.
 I do like clothes and got most of mine at the Bell Memorial Church rummage sale, but since the pandemic has put a halt to rummage sales I will have to make do with what I have, and I have plenty.
 I’m too old to care about what people might think. Oh, honestly, anyone who writes a column couldn’t possibly care what other people think or she wouldn’t make a fool out of herself in print. I hope they think kindly of me, but if they don’t and I don’t know it, well no harm done. If I know it, I might feel bad for a short time, but in the long run I wouldn’t dwell on it. I learned long ago that everyone doesn't love me and most people don't even know I exist.
 When I was teaching a writing class I was often asked how to write a column and I always replied, "Anyone can write a column if you don't mind putting your naked thoughts and feelings out there."
 I was never shy, but getting older has given me even more freedom to express myself. Who cares if an older lady speaks her mind when no one asked her what she was thinking? Who cares if a mature woman takes two pieces of cake? So what if I annoy folks by giving advice they never asked for and wouldn’t follow even if they thought it was good advice.
 I’m too old to be bothered about how I look. I gave up on the hair and body a long time ago. It is very freeing. My hair is up there where I don’t have to see it unless I look in a mirror, so out of sight out of mind. I like makeup, but I seem to lack the stick-to-it-ness to get it done right. Like you, I have never seen my own face. I can look in a mirror, but you know what mirrors do. I read once that a man invented a mirror that did not reverse the image. People who looked in that mirror saw their faces as it is for the very first time and they were disoriented. It wouldn’t take much to disorient me.
 As for this body, well it has been around and around for a while so it could use a lot of improvement, but that would take a big drink from the fountain of youth, and who knows where that is.

The Trump administration said Tuesday that it will not work with an international cooperative effort to develop and distribute a COVID-19 vaccine because it does not want to be constrained by multilateral groups like the World Health Organization. The decision to go it alone follows the White House's decision in early July to pull the United States out of the WHO, the AP reports. Trump claims the WHO is in need of reform and is heavily influenced by China. Some nations have worked directly to secure supplies of vaccine, but others are pooling efforts to ensure success against a disease that has no geographical boundaries. More than 150 countries are setting up the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, or COVAX.

Samsung has again unveiled a folding phone with a price tag of almost $2,000-- and it says the $1,999 Galaxy Z Fold 2 won't suffer from the issues that plagued the original Galaxy Fold last year. Samsung says the phone, its third folding phone and one that opens up into a tablet with a 7.6-inch screen, has a redesigned hinge similar to that on the Galaxy Flip, its second attempt at a folding phone, CNBC reports. TechRadar describes the new phone as "better in almost every way, except, perhaps for its name." It will be released on Sept. 18, eight days after Microsoft launches its "Surface Duo" folding phone. The AP notes that Samsung acknowledges that the price tag makes the new phone "definitely a luxury device." It includes a VIP package that CNBC reports will include perks like a prepared meal from a Michelin star restaurant. (Read more Samsung stories.)

Café coffee has been replaced by a countertop coffee pot and commuting to work means going from bedroom to kitchen. Spending more time indoors right now may be shedding light on spots around the house prone to disorderly chaos. The average household is likely storing more supplies and groceries than usual to avoid frequent trips to the store – and possibly to accommodate more people living under one roof. If storage space seems maxed out, perhaps it’s time to reorganize for efficiency.   To help homeowners reduce stress, RE/MAX of Southern Africa suggests the following ways to spring clean and bring order to the chaos.   • Repack the pantry and refrigerator   With more food staples on hand, now is a good time to clear everything off the shelves and put it all back in a stacked, organised, and easy-to-reach manner. A pantry, or fridge, will have greater capacity – and be easier to navigate – once the contents have been rearranged to save space. Check dates for expired condiments, which hog room along the door shelves, and consolidate loose items like granola bars into boxes or jars so no snack gets left behind.   • Use the storage space under the bathroom basin   This location may not be causing the stress, but its underutilised storage capabilities can help alleviate stress by clearing up space in other messy zones. The cabinet underneath the bathroom sink isn’t just for items like Band-Aids and plungers. Perhaps you have excess paper goods on hand – such as, ahem, toilet paper. This hidden gem storage space is the perfect spot for concealing odds and ends.   • Clothes belong in a wardrobe   So many shoes by the door and coats hanging over chairs but nowhere to go! If we’re honest, most of us clutter our spaces with slippers, sneakers, rain jackets and bags hanging on hooks, countertops, and unused armchairs. Store these items inside a closet – out of sight and out of mind. This will free up some much-needed space and leave your home feeling much more organised and less stressful.   • Clear the kitchen table at night   While your kitchen table might need to function as your home office or a homework spot for your children during the day, it does not need to stay that way at night. Try to keep this space as orderly as possible, not allowing clutter to linger when the workday or school day is done. Unless you’re in the midst of a great big puzzle, clear off the kitchen table at the end of each day so your house feels normal again when it’s time for rest and relaxation.   • Clean high-traffic areas regularly   Even after you have decluttered the shelves, countertops, and closets, you may still be feeling stress from the dust and dirt around you. To limit this, get into the habit of running a vacuum through high-traffic areas, like the living room, every few days so that visible dirt never piles up. Though life is out of routine at the moment, stick to regular maintenance such as wiping down kitchen counter surfaces daily and giving the bathroom a good scrub on the weekends.   “There are several factors in any household that are notorious for causing stress; some are easier to fix than others. But, if too little space in your home is causing unnecessary stress for you and your family, then now is the perfect time to consider moving. At the current interest rates, buying a new home has never been more affordable. To get a feel of what you can afford, speak to your nearest RE/MAX agent and explore your options,” concludes Regional Director and CEO of RE/MAX of Southern Africa, Adrian Goslett.
