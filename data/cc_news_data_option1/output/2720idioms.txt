 “I look at the Premier League now, in my time playing you had to get 20 goals, there was no option, you had to give the club 20 goals.
 “Now I see a lot of players finishing on 12, 13 goals and they are playing centre-forward.
 “When you’re at a big club you’ve got to have someone who can get you 20, 25, 30 goals a season if you’re trying to win the Premier League or win in Europe.”
