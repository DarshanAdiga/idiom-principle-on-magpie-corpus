"Birth and certainly your first time is already something riddled with unknowns and anxieties for lots of people, and to put a pandemic on top of it was the icing on the cake," Shaw said. "It's scary now but it was really frightening then, because we knew so little at the time."
 Shaw, it appears, was not alone in her concerns.
 In a survey of its members last month, the Midwives Association of B.C. found 89 per cent of those responding reported more women asking about the home birth option between March and November compared to inquiries made before that period.
 Almost 40 per cent described the increased interest in homebirths as moderate or large.
 In Ontario, a similar pattern emerged, said Jasmin Tecson, president of the Ontario Association of Midwives. Reports from across the province indicate more interest in both midwifery services and having babies in a non-hospital setting, she said.
 "We have noticed a distinct increase in people choosing home or birth centre instead of hospital," said Tecson, who has a midwifery practice in Toronto. "Practices on average, anecdotally, are reporting a planned (non-hospital birth) rate that's roughly double."

 LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Leicester City produced an impressive performance to secure a 2-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday after striker Jamie Vardy scored the opening goal and had a hand in the other against a toothless home side.
 Vardy netted a penalty on the stroke of halftime and his 59th-minute header led to Toby Alderweireld's own goal, lifting Leicester two places up to second on 27 points from 14 games, four behind champions Liverpool.
 Tottenham dropped two places to fourth after a second successive defeat, having suffered a 2-1 loss at Liverpool on Wednesday.
 The opening half produced few fireworks before it came to life in stoppage time as Leicester were awarded a penalty following a VAR check with Spurs manager Jose Mourinho already on his way to the tunnel.
 The Portuguese turned around and watched in dismay as the replay showed Serge Aurier clattered into Wesley Fofana on the edge of the area before Vardy blasted the spot-kick down the middle past goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
 Tottenham were let off the hook by VAR shortly after the break as James Maddison had a superb finish ruled out for marginal offside, as he took James Justin's long ball in his stride before burying a shot past Lloris.
 Vardy got on the end of Marc Albrighton's cross from the right and his header at the far post cannoned off Alderweireld into the back of the net.
 Spurs pressed in the closing stages as Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel kept out Son Heung-min's close-range effort with a brilliant save before the visitors twice came close to adding a third goal.
 Vardy said Leicester executed their game plan to perfection, adding that the Foxes needed to improve their home form after clinching a sixth away win in seven games.
 "We've come here with a gameplan and we've absolutely nailed what we wanted to do," he told Sky Sports.
 "It's set us on the way to get the three points that we think we deserved.
 "It obviously shows we're doing something wrong in our home games. We need to get these performances going in week, week out and hopefully pick up some more wins." (Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic; Editing by Christian Radnedge and Ed Osmond)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The leader of the Trump administration's vaccination program says people who have been infected with the coronavirus — a group that includes President Donald Trump — should be vaccinated.
 Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of Operation Warp Speed, told CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday that the vaccine is safe for those who have recovered and offers stronger and potentially longer protection than does the virus itself.
 “We know that infection doesn’t induce a very strong immune response and it wanes over time. So I think, as a clear precaution, it is appropriate to be vaccinated because it’s safe," he said. “I think people should be vaccinated, indeed.”
 Trump has not received the first of two vaccination shots, which began being administered last week as part of the largest vaccination campaign in the nation's history. Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., all were given doses Friday. President-elect Joe Biden was to receive his Monday.
 All have chosen to publicize their injections as part of a campaign to convince a skeptical public that the vaccines are safe and effective, in hopes of finally putting an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 310,000 people in the United States and upended life around the globe.
 Trump has spent the last week largely out of sight as he continues to stew about his election loss and floats increasingly outlandish schemes to remain in power.

It’s an approach that has bewildered top aides who see his silence as a missed opportunity for the president, who leaves office Jan. 20, to claim credit for helping oversee the speedy development of the vaccine and to burnish his legacy.Trump was hospitalized with COVID-19 in October and given an experimental monoclonal antibody treatment that he credited for his swift recovery.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s&nbsp;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&nbsp;said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was the first to receive authorization, “is safe and likely efficacious” in people who have been infected with COVID-19 and “should be offered regardless of history of prior symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.”While there is no recommended minimum wait time between infection and vaccination, because reinfection is uncommon in the three months after a person is infected, the committee said people who tested positive in the preceding 90 days “may delay vaccination until near the end of this period, if desired.”The advisers also recommended that those who received the kind of treatment Trump did should put off being vaccinated for at least 90 days to avoid potential interference.“Currently, there are no data on the safety and efficacy of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccination in persons who received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment,”&nbsp;they wrote, recommending that vaccination “be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses.”Trump, who in the past has spread misinformation about vaccine risks,&nbsp;tweeted earlier this month&nbsp;that he was “not scheduled to take the vaccine, but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.” The White House has said he is still in discussion with his medical team about when he should.“When the time is right, I’m sure he will remain willing to take it,” White House spokesperson Brian Morgenstern echoed Friday. “It’s just something we’re working through.”Surgeon General Jerome Adams echoed that argument on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when asked if Trump planed to receive the shot on camera to help allay concerns about its safety, especially among Republicans.“From a scientific point of view, I will remind people that the president has had COVID within the last 90 days. He received the monoclonal antibodies. And that is actually one scenario where we tell people maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine, talk to your health provider to find out the right time,” Adams said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious diseases expert, has recommend that Trump be vaccinated publicly without delay.“Even though the president himself was infected, and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we’re not sure how long that protection lasts. So, to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated,” he told ABC News.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
