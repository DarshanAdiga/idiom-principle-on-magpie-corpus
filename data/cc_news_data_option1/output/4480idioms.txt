An exhibition displaying the city's wildlife has kicked off at the Shanghai Natural History Museum.
 The exhibition, running through November 28, introduces the city’s insects, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, allowing people to savor the city’s natural charm and giving food for thought about how to make space for wildlife in urban areas.
 Chirping insects, croaking frogs and singing birds are among the wildlife species nearest to human beings,while few people are aware of the threats of urbanization to them.
 Not only endangered species such as the panda and tiger, but also small creatures around us need protection, according to He Xin from the museum.
 Amphibians are among the species most affected by urban sprawl. Of nearly 7,000 amphibians in the world, nearly one-third are facing extinction, and numbers of many more are reducing. In Shanghai, there were 11 frog species in the 1980s; that number decreased to eight in the 1990s and only six at present.
 Reptiles, however, face a worse plight, according to He.
 Reptiles prefer warm places, and Shanghai is not an ideal place for them. As modern structures are quickly springing up and covering the city’s landscape, the habitat for reptiles is shrinking.

ATLANTA (AP) — Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock advanced to a Jan. 5 runoff in Georgia, the only state with both its U.S. Senate seats on the ballot.
 Loeffler and Warnock were the top two finishers in a crowded field that also included Republican Rep. Doug Collins. But neither was able to get the 50% threshold needed in order to win outright.
 In Georgia's second Senate race, GOP Sen. David Perdue was seeking a second term against Democrat John Ossoff. Incomplete election returns showed Perdue leading, but the race could not be called.

Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, was appointed last year to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson. Warnock is pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached and is trying to become Georgia's first Black U.S. senator.
 Collins conceded defeat late Tuesday and immediately endorsed Loeffler after months of bitter attacks between the two over who was more conservative. Loeffler urged Republican voters to unite behind her in the runoff against Warnock.
 "You all know how important it is that we all come together," she said, "because the radical left wants to take over this country."
 Warnock addressed supporters and promised to fight for "ordinary people" worried about keeping their jobs and healthcare.
 "It never mattered much to me, and it doesn't matter tonight, who I have to run against," Warnock said, "because I've always been clear about who I'm running for."
 Warnock gained the backing of Democratic leaders including former President Barack Obama. That helped clear the field for Warnock on the Democratic side while Loeffler and Collins battled it out on the right.
 Either Loeffler or Warnock will serve the rest of Isakson's term. The seat goes on the ballot again in 2022.
 Democrats haven't won a Senate race in Georgia in two decades. But ongoing population growth around Atlanta and shifting demographics that have made the state less white — along with dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump in the suburbs — have helped fuel hope among Democrats that the state is in play.
 Both sides poured huge amounts of money into the races, and record numbers of people cast ballots early, some facing hourslong lines. Georgia has also seen a large increase in absentee ballots cast by mail.
 Voting on Tuesday was off to a fairly smooth start despite some technical issues, and wait times were relatively short — a big change from the June 9 primaries when poll worker shortages, coronavirus restrictions and trouble with new voting machines led to chaos and long lines at some polling places, especially around Atlanta.
 Perdue, a former business executive and a close Trump ally, faces Ossoff, a documentary film producer who launched his political career with an unsuccessful 2017 run for Congress. Their race has been characterized by sharp attacks but relatively moderate political positions.
 Perdue has sought to cast Ossoff as backing a "radical socialist agenda," while Ossoff has portrayed Perdue as a "corrupt" Washington insider.
 Loeffler and Collins, a four-term congressman who is one of Trump's most visible defenders in the House, fought a fierce battle for voters from the conservative base of the GOP. Warnock mostly floated above the fray.
 Though Collins immediately endorsed Loeffler as part of his concession, the bitterly personal tone of their attacks could make it difficult for supporters of the Republican rivals to unite in time for the January runoff, University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said.

WASHINGTON • In Spalding County, Georgia, machine problems led to a two-hour extension for voting. Wait times stretched beyond an hour at four voting centers in Baltimore. And this, unique to 2020: Sanitizer on voters’ hands caused a ballot scanner to jam at a polling place in Des Moines, Iowa.
 Minor problems like these happen during every election. But Tuesday’s voting appeared largely free of any major glitches — despite being held during a deadly pandemic that has killed more than 230,000 Americans and infected more than 9 million.
 The FBI was investigating reports of efforts to discourage people from voting using automated calls in a few states. Such reports are common in every election.
 But there were no signs Tuesday of large-scale voter intimidation efforts or clashes at the polls, as some had feared, given the intensity on either side of the hotly contested race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden.

India’s T20 skipper and Supernovas captain Harmanpreet Kaur is hoping to find an option for the national team’s middle order from the Women’s T20 Challenge that starts in Sharjah on Wednesday.
 Defending champions Supernovas, led by Harmanpreet, take on Mithali Raj’s Velocity in the opening match in a repeat of last year’s final, eyeing a third title on the trot.
 Trailblazers is the third team in the four-match tournament, competing against each other once before the summit clash on November 9. Cricketers from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and New Zealand will also participate.
 “It has been a long time we have not played cricket, but we are very excited, at least we are going to play some cricket which as professionals we would always like to do. We are looking forward to the tournament and hope to do well,” Harmanpreet said at a press conference on Tuesday.
 The dashing batter, who led India out in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup final earlier this year, added that she hoped to find an option for the team’s lineup to play after her.

"It's time for a different approach," Hickenlooper said in an live video message posted on Facebook.
 But several battlegrounds broke for Republicans, including an open seat in Kansas. Rep. Roger Marshall prevailed over Democratic state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a former Republican, who energized Democrats in a state that hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932.
 From New England to the Deep South and the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republicans defended seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats. The Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, its economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood all seemed to be on the ballot.
 Trump loomed large over the Senate races as did Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. They swooped into key states, including Iowa, Georgia and Michigan, in the final days of the campaigns. Voters ranked the pandemic and the economy as top concerns, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate.
 Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.
 In Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fended off Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot in a costly campaign, but he acknowledged his GOP colleagues face tougher races.
 "We don't know which party will control the Senate," McConnell said from Louisville. "But some things are certain already. We know grave challenges will remain before us, challenges that could not care less about our political polarization. We know our next president will need to unite the country, even as we all continue to bring different ideas and commitments to the table."
 White House confidant Lindsey Graham survived the fight of his political life in South Carolina against Democrat Jamie Harrison, whose campaign stunned Washington by drawing more than $100 million in small-scale donations. In Texas, Sen. John Cornyn turned back Democrat MJ Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot, in his hardest-fought election in almost two decades.
 Republicans flipped the seat in Alabama that Democrat Doug Jones had won in a special election as former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville was elected in the Trump stronghold.
 In Georgia, two Senate seats were being contested.
 One already is headed to a Jan. 5 runoff after no candidate reached the 50% threshold to win. GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler will face Democrat Raphael Warnock in a special election for the seat Loeffler was tapped to fill for retired Sen. Johnny Isakson.
 In the other, GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, tried to stave off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the "green wave" of campaign donations. It too, is expected to go to a runoff.

 Authorities worked well into Tuesday to determine whether there were any other attackers, with some 1,000 police officers on duty in the city. People in Vienna were urged to stay at home if possible on Tuesday, and children did not have to go to school.
 By mid-afternoon, investigators sifting through copious video evidence had found "no indication of a second perpetrator," Nehammer said. "But because the evaluation is not yet concluded, we cannot yet say conclusively how many perpetrators are responsible for the crime."
 For the time being, an elevated security level will remain in place in Vienna, he said. The country held a minute of silence at midday Tuesday, accompanied by the tolling of bells in the capital, and the government ordered three days of official mourning, with flags on public buildings to be flown at half- staff.
 The shooting began shortly after 8 p.m. Monday near Vienna's main synagogue as many people were enjoying a last night of open restaurants and bars before a monthlong coronavirus lockdown, which started at midnight.
 Nine minutes later, it was over, Nehammer said.
 Alois Schroll, an Austrian lawmaker and the mayor of the town of Ybbs, said he had just arrived at a nearby restaurant when the shooting began. He said he "saw many, many people running with their hands up high, they were in a panic and screaming."
 Police "sealed off the entire restaurant," Schroll, 52, told The Associated Press. "People inside the restaurant were in shock, there were several women who were crying. And it wasn't until shortly before 1 a.m., that police finally let us out of the restaurant."
 Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister said he saw at least one person shoot at people sitting outside at bars in the street below his window near the city's main synagogue.
 "They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building," Hofmeister said.
 The attack drew swift condemnation and assurances of support from leaders around Europe, including from French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country has experienced three terror attacks in recent weeks. U.S. President Donald Trump also condemned "yet another vile act of terrorism in Europe." Britain raised its terror threat level to severe, its second-highest level, following the attack in Austria and others in France.

"Winning is easy," Trump told reporters. "Losing is never easy, not for me it's not."
 Trump left open the possibility of addressing the nation Tuesday night, even if a winner hadn't been determined. Biden was also scheduled to give a nighttime speech from Wilmington.
 "I'm superstitious about predicting what an outcome's gonna be until it happens ... but I'm hopeful," said Biden. "It's just so uncertain ... you can't think of an election in the recent past where so many states were up for grabs."
 The momentum from early voting carried into Election Day, as an energized electorate produced long lines at polling sites throughout the country. Turnout was higher than in 2016 in numerous counties, including all of Florida, nearly every county in North Carolina and more than 100 counties in both Georgia and Texas. That tally seemed sure to increase as more counties reported their turnout figures.
 Voters braved worries of the coronavirus, threats of polling place intimidation and expectations of long lines caused by changes to voting systems, but appeared undeterred as turnout appeared it would easily surpass the 139 million ballots cast four years ago.
 No major problems arose on Tuesday, outside the typical glitches of a presidential election: Some polling places opened late, robocalls provided false information to voters in Iowa and Michigan, and machines or software malfunctioned in some counties in the battleground states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Texas.
 The cybersecurity agency at the Department of Homeland Security said there were no outward signs by midday of any malicious activity.
 The record-setting early vote — and legal skirmishing over how it would be counted — drew unsupported allegations of fraud from Trump, who had repeatedly refused to guarantee he would honor the election's result.
 With the coronavirus now surging anew, voters ranked the pandemic and the economy as top concerns in the race between Trump and Biden, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate.
 Voters were especially likely to call the public health crisis the nation's most important issue, with the economy following close behind. Fewer named health care, racism, law enforcement, immigration or climate change
 The survey found that Trump's leadership loomed large in voters' decision- making. Nearly two-thirds of voters said their vote was about Trump — either for him or against him.

The win puts New Jersey on the path to have the largest weed market on the east coast and one of the largest in the US.

New Jersey first has to establish rules before weed businesses open, so it’s unclear when the new industry will start.

For Loeffler, "her challenge would be to simply get Republicans back behind her," Bullock said. "That's a real risk."
 Joey Odom of Savannah voted early for Perdue, saying his support for the coastal city's seaport has helped the local economy. A 58-year-old sales representative for a manufacturer, Odom said he typically votes Republican. He gave Trump and Perdue high marks for their efforts to reopen businesses during the coronavirus pandemic.
 "I feel for some of the states that are still essentially shut down while ours is up and running to an extent," Odom said.
 In Decatur just outside Atlanta, Linnea Pace, 57, voted early for Ossoff. She said she didn't vote for any Republicans.
 "I live in a Black, middle-class neighborhood. I haven't seen any Republican come into my neighborhood and ask me what is going on," Pace said, noting that Ossoff had visited her church.
 Pace also said she believes Perdue sold stock to benefit himself when he first learned the coronavirus could devastate the U.S. economy.
 "He knew that pandemic was coming," she said.
 Both Perdue and Loeffler were among senators whose stock trades, made just before the virus caused a downturn in the markets, came under scrutiny. Both denied wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by independent advisers and were ultimately cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee.
 Regardless, their opponents made the trades a central line of attack. Collins accused Loeffler of "pandemic profiteering," while Ossoff accused Perdue of having "profited from the pandemic while he downplayed the risk."
 The top Democrats outraised the Republican incumbents, but the Republicans were also buoyed by outside spending. More than $160 million has been spent on television and digital advertising by candidates and outside groups in both races.
 In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, John Benson showed up nearly an hour before polls opened at the Cobb County Civic Center, waiting in near freezing temperatures. He said he wants senators who are not afraid to stand up to the president.
 "Since Donald Trump been in office, it's been like a lot of them have been scared to speak up," Benson said.

Electric taxi platform BluSmart is looking at raising USD 10-12 million in its third funding round shortly to fund its geographical expansion and aggressive marketing.
 The first leg of expansion will have the Delhi-NCR-only electric cab aggregator entering Mumbai, where it is already piloting the service with 25 cars.
 So far, it has had two funding rounds -- USD 3 million in September 2019 and USD 7 million in August 2020 -- wherein the promoters divested over a quarter of their holding to investors such as Mayfield, the S K Munjal family, Inflection Point Ventures, Mumbai Angels and actor Deepika Padukone, among others, co-founder and chief executive Anmol Jaggi said.
 "We should be able to close our third funding round in the first quarter of 2021. We are looking at raising USD 10-12 million more in equity. We've divested a little over 25 per cent for USD 10 million and we are ready to divest more," Jaggi told PTI over phone from New Delhi.
 He also said the company will post operating profit in a few months but refused to share how much it earns in revenue now.
 "We are on the verge of turning operationally profitable. We're sharply focussed on profitability," Jaggi said.
 According to analysts, an EV cab firm like BluSmart can break even if every cab on its platform makes ₹1,800 a day.
 "Business is doing pretty well with weekly growth clipping at 15 per cent or 60 per cent monthly now," he said, adding that if the present demand trend continues, November riding should be 45,000, up from 30,000 last month.
 The company has 350 cars on its platform, of which 200 are owned by the government agency EESL, 80 are on lease and 70 are owned by HNIs, he said, adding the existing investors have ordered 900 more cabs from Tata Motors and M&M.
 BluSmart pays 12 per cent of the riding income to the car owners and pays ₹16,000 to ₹24,000 to each driver, whose take-home depends on the distance driven and also the rider ratings. So an average driver draws the lowest while the best ones get the highest pay, he said.
 The company owns the charging stations (120 currently) and also takes care of car maintenance.
 KPMG India, in a report on Tuesday, said the EV car penetration can reach around 30 per cent in the commercial segment and around 15 per cent in the personal segment by 2030.
 It also expects around 12 per cent of the overall bus market to be electrified by then, while three-wheeler penetration should be around 75 per cent.

On Tuesday night, hours before Abiy's announcement, Wondimu Asamnew, another senior Tigrayan official, told AFP the federal government was amassing troops on the southern border of Tigray -- a claim that could not be independently verified.
 "I think when it comes to military mobilisation, it's not child's play. It can trigger all-out war... what they are doing is playing with fire," Wondimu said.
 "A small spark can ignite the whole region. So I think we are on the alert and I can assure you we are capable of defending ourselves."

"Virginia voters spoke loud and clear in approving Amendment 1," they said. "In creating a bipartisan redistricting commission, they said they want a seat at the table when district lines are drawn next year and beyond. They said they want a transparent redistricting process. They want civil rights protections to be added to the state constitution for the very first time.
