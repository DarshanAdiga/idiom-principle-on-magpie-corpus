The absence of cars in lanes was one reason KAR Global was able to report a third-quarter profit, despite lower revenue.
 Gaining efficiencies by going digital is part of a strategy that was accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic and is unlikely to change anytime soon, CEO Jim Hallett said.
 "We are 100 percent digital, and we have no plans to return to running cars," Hallett told investors in a conference call Wednesday.
 Hallett had already been shifting the auction company in a more digital direction before the pandemic hit, citing safety concerns around cars and trucks running through lanes. In March, as COVID-19 cases were rising in the U.S., KAR shuttered auction operations before resuming them as all-digital sales in April.
 Many employees who supported sale-day operations have been let go. In March, KAR had 15,000 active employees. By early April, it had furloughed some 11,000 of them. About 6,000 employees have since been called back.
 KAR announced in September that it had agreed to pay $425 million to acquire BacklotCars, a web-based dealer-to-dealer wholesale platform that offers a mobile app, similar to the company's TradeRev product. The transaction is expected to close before the end of the year.
 And KAR has a minority stake in CarLotz, an online used-vehicle consignment platform that hopes to go public via a reverse merger this quarter.
 It all points to a company that continues to focus on deriving revenue from digital offerings after a turbulent spring and summer in the wholesale market.
 "It is clear to me that we are a very different business today than we were one year ago, and I am encouraged by the future prospects of our business," Hallett said Wednesday.
 KAR's revenue fell 15 percent to $593.6 million in the third quarter. Net income from continuing operations rose 33 percent to $47.1 million.

Spring-flowering bulbs offer an array of color in late winter and early spring that is much needed after a long dreary winter. When most people think of spring-flowering bulbs, tulips and daffodils come to mind. However, there are some other bulbs that you need to consider that will brighten up the garden and add an extra special touch to any spot. Crocus, snowdrops, hyacinth, trout lilies, snowflakes, Muscari, lily of the valley are a few that come to mind, which I enjoy watching as they unfurl, showing off their beautiful flowers.      Gardening is often an exercise of delayed gratification, and this is certainly true with spring-flowering bulbs. You plant them in the fall and you have to wait until spring to see the results of your hard work. One thing that is great about these bulbs is they return year after year. Plus many bulbs are deer-resistant which is becoming a necessity in certain neighborhoods.      These bulbs are generally planted when the soil is below 60 degrees F in the fall. I have found where I live I can plant as late as November and early December and still get a great display in the spring.      One of the earliest bulbs to break ground in my garden are snowdrops (Galanthus nivalis). They are quite graceful looking and resemble little white bells dancing on a stem. Being so dainty and attractive, and coming as early as they do makes them one of my favorites. They grow well in partial shade with moist to semi-dry soil with plenty of organic matter. Because of their small size, they show up best planted in a mass.      I have one group of snowdrops that always blooms around the first of November but most of them flower just after Christmas. They do better in cooler climates but I have found if you locate them properly in your garden that will contribute to their success.      Crocus is an old favorite for many. These dainty short flowers come in a wonderful assortment of colors, from purple, white, yellow and striped variations, growing about 4 to 6 inches high. I have had some bloom when snow is on the ground, making a pretty picture.      Crocuses prefer well-drained soil and will grow in partial shade or full sun. They are perfect for garden borders and even look great when planted in a lawn. After I plant my crocus bulbs, I put a piece of hardware cloth wire, something smaller than chicken wire, on the top and then cover with soil. This prevents squirrels from digging them up.      Creating a display of Muscari is my latest project. These lovely little flowers are often called grape hyacinth because they resemble grapes on a stem and are similar to hyacinths.      Last year, I planted several thousand Muscari bulbs in a long wide area, trying to have the Muscari flowers resemble a stream of water. I had seen this design planted in his way when visiting Keukenhof garden in Holland. I have been thinking about it for years and I finally took on the project.      Hyacinths bloom around the same time as daffodils and tulips, and have a wonderful fragrance! Small clusters of tiny bell-shaped blooms decorate a stout stem. Hyacinths come in charming shades of blue, pink, baby blue, yellow and white. Flower size may decline in subsequent years, and I really like them better this way because they are daintier.      Ornamental alliums are the rage now. They make a dramatic statement in the garden, especially the varieties with large global heads. These purple pom-pom flowers look quite dramatic when planted en masse. Another interesting fact is they are from the onion family so they are generally deer- and rodent- resistant. Depending on the variety will determine exactly when they will bloom in the spring.      An annual application of compost should provide adequate nutrients. Most spring-flowering bulbs prefer to have the soil moist when they are growing, but want reduced watering as the bulb foliage begins to die back. Be sure to let the foliage die naturally before removing, so that the bulbs can fill their storehouses for blooms the following year. The foliage acts like solar panels, taking in all the sun it needs to develop a lovely flower for the next year.

India has strongly underlined its interest in the expeditious extradition of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya, who has completed all the legal processes related to extradition from the UK, during talks between foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and UK home secretary Priti Patel in London.On the last leg of his three-nation Europe tour, Shringla has been holding discussions in London with several UK ministers and officials and during his interactions with Patel and UK foreign office minister for South Asia, Lord Tariq Ahmad, on Tuesday, the issue of economic offenders being extradited to face the Indian judicial system was among the issues raised.We strongly underlined our interest in seeing the early, expeditious extradition of Vijay Mallya, who is an economic offender who has completed all extradition procedures in the UK. We would like him to return to India as soon as possible, said Shringla. Also, Nirav Modi. I raised this with both Lord Ahmad and the Home Secretary, and both took very careful note of our priority and sentiments in that regard, he said.Mallya wanted in India over fraud and money laundering charges in relation to loans taken out by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from state-owned Indian banks, has been found to have a case to answer in India by the UK courts. He is currently on bail, undergoing a confidential legal issue before Priti Patel can consider signing off on his extradition order.On the other hand, Nirav Modi, the fugitive diamond merchant accused of fraud and money laundering in relation to the state-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB), is currently lodged in Wandsworth Prison in London as he fights his extradition to India at Westminster Magistrates' Court.Shringla arrived in London following visits to Paris and Berlin on Tuesday and has held a series of meetings to cover a wide range of issues, including the India-UK vaccine partnership in a post-coronavirus world and climate change as well as highlighting India's outlook on the growing importance of the Indo-Pacific region.On India-UK bilateral ties, the foreign secretary noted the backdrop of Britain's exit from the European Union (EU) paving the way for a reset in the relationship both with the UK and the EU. We are looking at early harvest deals, which would bring benefits to both our countries, followed by a more detailed, either preferential trade agreement or a free trade agreement,&quot; said Shringla.&quot;Obviously, a limited deal means we work on those areas on which both sides can immediately agree to. We need more time to conclude a more comprehensive trade agreement but our ministers are in touch and will work on trying to close such a deal, he said. We are also looking at a similar deal at the EU level, but the bilateral agreement is always different from an agreement with a group, he added.The Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Gaitri Issar Kumar, highlighted the five priority areas of food and drink, life sciences, information and communications technology (ICT), chemicals and services that have been narrowed down by both sides, with Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal and UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss set to take stock of the level of movement in these areas during talks scheduled for November 9.Meanwhile, foreign secretary Dominic Raab and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are among the high-level visits from the UK to India scheduled for 2021, depending on the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown situation.Foreign secretary Shringla noted that with the UK currently undertaking an Integrated Review of its policy framework, the Indo-Pacific region is expected to play a key part in the transformational relationship that Raab has previously made reference to vis&amp;ndash;vis India.We believe in the vision of free, open, transparent, and inclusive Indo-Pacific stakeholders; we believe in multi-polarity. The framework is there in France and Germany and we see it in the UK also, though it is yet to be articulated in the policy framework. It (the Indo-Pacific) has become more significant, relevant, and topical, said Shringla.Besides his ministerial-level and official talks, the foreign secretary also conducted a host of discussions with leading business chiefs and CEOs and is scheduled to interact with representatives of the Indian diaspora later on Wednesday before he heads back to India at the end of his European tour.

 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (Reuters) - With the U.S. presidential election turning into a nail-biter, bankers, traders and financial analysts told Reuters on Wednesday that Wall Street was worried the ultimate winner could have tough sledding working with a divided Congress to fight the coronavirus pandemic and pass a quick economic stimulus package.
 They spoke as several key states were still reporting tight margins between Republican President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Though Biden has the lead, millions of votes still need to be counted and the outcome may not be certain for days.
 Meanwhile, Congress looked to remain divided. Democrats maintained a firm grip on the House of Representatives which means Trump would probably have to compromise to pass legislation. Republicans looked likely to keep control of the Senate, which would make it harder for a Biden administration to get legislation passed or cabinet members or judges approved.
 "Now having (a stimulus package) done in early January or February becomes a big feat," said a bank lobbyist who was not authorized to speak publicly. "That's where the minds of bank managements are going to be next and that is certainly what the markets are focused on."
 Major U.S. stock indexes opened 0.1% to 2.5% higher on Wednesday, not the relief rally some had expected, but also not a terrifying plunge. Investors who wanted to make daring bets largely put those positions on ahead of the election and want certainty before taking further action, sources said.
 JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, one of Wall Street's emissaries, urged people to be patient for the final election results and said he had faith in the systems that will decide the outcome. Other prominent financiers took to Twitter to joke about the situation or express personal feelings.
 "I was wrong. It hurts," wrote Mike Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc partner who is now active in cryptocurrency and donates to Democrats. He had expected voters to hand Biden a more decisive win.
 Ahead of the election, the financial industry´s biggest worry was soaring taxes and tough regulation if a "blue wave" on election day put Biden in the White House and Democrats in control of both the Senate and the House.
 This scenario sparked worry that pressure from progressive Wall Street critics like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez could push Biden further from his historically moderate positions on the economy and regulations.
 Concerns receded with election tallies showing Biden ahead and Republicans almost certain to hold the Senate, Wall Street sources said.
 "The concept that Elizabeth Warren would be running Treasury and Bernie Sanders would be running the Department of Labor is a lot less likely this morning than it was if we have had that 'Blue Wave,'" said Fred Cannon, research director for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.
 Still, big financial companies remain anxious that the federal government will struggle to pass meaningful legislation to control the pandemic or help consumers and businesses struggling through lockdown measures, he said.
 David Boies, a prominent corporate lawyer who represented former Vice President Al Gore in a U.S. Supreme Court case that put Republican George W. Bush, in the White House, said his Wall Street contacts prefer a divided government that makes it hard to pass laws that make extreme changes in the status quo.
 This unusual election say historically high turnout in a politically polarized population and a much larger than usual number of mail-in votes during a deadly pandemic, which slowed down vote counting in key states. The divide between Biden and Trump narrowed from about 200,000 votes to just 6,000 within hours, he noted. He believes the uncertainty could last several days.
 "Everyone, whether it's the man in the street or the man on Wall Street, is fascinated and focused on how this is changing," Boies said.

El legendario exfutbolista, de 60 años recien cumplidos, fue intervenido en la clinica privada Olivos, situada en la misma localidad al norte de Buenos Aires."Todo fue un exito y se dio tal cual estaba previsto. Diego esta en su habitacion descansando", informo un comunicado de la oficina de prensa de Maradona.Fue el cierre de una larga jornada en la que Maradona amanecio en otro establecimiento medico en la ciudad de La Plata, 40 kilometros al sur de la capital argentina, con un cuadro de deshidratacion y anemia hasta que por la tarde del martes una tomografia de rutina detecto un hematoma subdural, que es la acumulacion de sangre entre la membrana y el cerebro generalmente provocada por un golpe en la cabeza.En estos casos, la cirugia consiste en practicar un pequeño orificio en el craneo para drenar el liquido acumulado.Si bien no fue una intervencion de riesgo, los antecedentes medicos de Maradona generaron alarma en su pais natal.El campeon del mundo con la seleccion argentina en Mexico 1986 y subcampeon en Italia 1990 en dos ocasiones estuvo al borde de la muerte por sus adicciones a las drogas y el alcohol. El año pasado fue intervenido en una de sus rodillas.Donato Villani, responsable del departamento medico de la Asociacion del Futbol Argentino (AFA), habia dicho mas temprano al canal TyC Sports que la cirugia a la que sera sometido el Diez "en cualquier persona normal tiene que ir bien, pero convengamos que Diego es distinto. Todas las patologias que tuvo en los ultimos 20 años no creo que nosotros podamos contarlo y el si".Villani visito a Maradona este martes a pedido del presidente de la AFA, Claudio Tapia. Dijo que "hoy lo vi bien, a diferencia del viernes".El exfutbolista de Boca Juniors, Barcelona y Napoli, entre otros clubes, cumplio los 60 años el viernes pasado y aparecio publicamente en la cancha de Gimnasia para dirigir ante Patronato por la primera fecha de la liga argentina.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Disappointed Democrats drove Wednesday toward extending their control of the House for two more years but with a potentially shrunken majority as they lost at least seven incumbents and failed to oust any Republican lawmakers in initial returns.By midmorning on Wednesday, Democrats' only gains were two North Carolina seats vacated by GOP incumbents after a court-ordered remapping made the districts more Democratic. Though they seemed likely to retain House control, their performance was an unexpected disappointment for the party, which hoped for modest gains of perhaps 15 seats.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., talks to reporters about Election Day results in races for the House of Representatives, at Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 3, 2020. She was joined on a video call by Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ()After decades of trying, Republicans defeated 15-term Rep. Collin Peterson from a rural Minnesota district that backed President Donald Trump in 2016 by 31 percentage points, Trump’s biggest margin in any Democratic-held district. Peterson, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee, opposed Trump’s impeachment and is one of the House’s most conservative Democrats. He was defeated by Republican Michelle Fischbach, the former lieutenant governor.In Iowa, GOP state Rep. Ashley Hinson defeated freshman Democratic incumbent Abby Finkenauer to win a hard-fought race for the state’s northeastern congressional seat. Hinson is a former television news anchor.Also losing were freshmen Democrats Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, health secretary under President Bill Clinton, in adjacent South Florida districts where Trump seemed to consolidate support among Cuban voters. Others defeated were Democratic freshmen Joe Cunningham of South Carolina, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and Kendra Horn in Oklahoma, who had surprising victories in 2018 in districts Trump carried decisively in 2016.The fight for Torres Small’s seat cost around $35 million, making it one of the country’s most expensive races, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. She was defeated by Yvette Herrell, a former state legislator.Democrats were also disappointed in the Senate, where they nursed fading hopes of winning the majority. Trump’s challenge from Democrat Joe Biden remained too close to call.Before votes were counted, both parties' operatives said the GOP would be fortunate to limit Democratic gains to a modest single digits. Democrats control the House 232-197, with five open seats and one independent. It takes 218 seats to control the chamber.A smaller Democratic majority would make it tougher for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to unite her lawmakers as a handful of progressive freshmen arrive for the new Congress.By retaining House control, Democrats would mark only the second time in a quarter century that they’ve led the chamber for two consecutive two-year Congresses. The first period ran from 2007 through 2010, when Pelosi was serving her first four years in her post.“Our purpose in this race was to win so that we could protect the Affordable Care Act and so that we could crush the virus,” Pelosi told reporters, citing former President Barack Obama’s health care act. She declared that Democrats had won the House majority, which seemed highly likely but hadn’t been officially declared by The Associated Press.Democrats' hopes of protecting their majority and even expanding it were based on public anxiety over the pandemic, Trump’s alienation of suburban voters and a vast fundraising edge. But those advantages didn’t carry them as far as they’d hoped.With GOP expectations for capturing the House all but nonexistent entering Election Day, Republicans were happy with the results.“House Republicans have outperformed all expectations,” said Dan Conston, who heads the Congressional Leadership Fund, a committee aligned with House GOP leaders that provides millions to Republican candidates.Democrats lost a majority Hispanic district in West Texas they expected to win when the GOP incumbent retired. And they lost a series of what seemed coin-flip races, failing to defeat GOP incumbents in Cincinnati, rural Illinois, central Virginia and the suburbs of St. Louis and Texas.In a district between Austin and San Antonio, freshman GOP Rep. Chip Roy withstood a challenge from Democrat Wendy Davis. Davis gained fame as a state legislator by waging a 2013 filibuster against an anti-abortion bill, then lost a race for governor the following year. The conservative Club for Growth made her its biggest target, spending over $6 million against her this year.As if symbolically, Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, was in her own tight race in a closely divided district she won by 24 percentage points in 2018.Some endangered Democratic freshmen like Texas' Lizzie Fletcher, Georgia’s Lucy McBath and New Jersey’s Tom Malinowski and Andy Kim held on.But the party notched no victories in long-shot races they’d hoped would bolster their majority. Republicans retained such districts in central North Carolina; Montana; Omaha, Nebraska; and around Little Rock, Arkansas.As Wednesday morning progressed, other hotly fought races remained undecided in Indiana and Virginia.Scores of both parties' incumbents from safe districts were easily reelected. These included progressive star Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez in New York City and both parties' No. 3 House leaders, Democrat James Clyburn of South Carolina and Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming.Also coming to Washington will be New York City area Democrats Jamaal Bowman, a progressive who was backed by Ocasio-Cortez, and Ritchie Torres, who will be Congress' first openly gay Hispanic.In one noteworthy but unsurprising result, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has espoused unfounded QAnon conspiracy theories, won a vacant seat in northwest Georgia. Trump has called Greene a “future Republican star.” QAnon asserts that Trump is quietly waging a battle against pedophiles in government.Hanging over the contests were the coronavirus pandemic and the wounded economy, which voters ranked as top concerns, according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of the electorate. The virus has killed 232,000 people in the U.S. and cases are rising in nearly every state, while millions have lost jobs.Buoying Democrats was a coast-to-coast edge in campaign fundraising, including for all 29 Democrats from districts Trump won in 2016 and Republicans were targeting. By early Wednesday, Peterson, Cunningham and Torres Small were the only ones of those Democrats who’d lost.Nearly all Democratic incumbents in potentially vulnerable districts were outspending their GOP challengers, often by vast margins, according to an AP analysis of Federal Election Commission campaign reports.As in 2018 when they grabbed House control, Democratic ads emphasized pledges to make health care more accessible, preserve coverage for pre-existing conditions and shield voters from Republicans out to terminate those requirements. Many Republicans say they want to dismantle Obama’s health care law while retaining its coverage for pre-existing conditions, but they’ve not presented a detailed proposal for doing that.The pandemic has only amplified Democrats' focus on health care. Trump’s repeated false statements downplaying the virus' severity have also given Democrats political fodder.AP VoteCast is a nationwide survey of more than 127,000 voters and nonvoters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.___Find AP’s full election coverage at APNews.com/Election2020.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

“It is unfair but at the same time we had games where we didn’t wake up and play hard enough when we had a grip on our own fate,” he said.
 The Cowboys lost to No. 2 Blue Ridge and No. 5 Camp Verde while splitting the season series with seventh-ranked region foe Bisbee.
 “We faced tougher opponents and lost to them while Bisbee didn’t face anybody tough but us and that counted against us,” head coach Juan Rodriguez said.
 Willcox was 7-3 overall while Bisbee was 8-1 against only South region opponents. The tiebreaker was the overall record, no matter what the strength of the opponents.
 “They should have given us a tiebreaker game against Bisbee and then I would be more comfortable with this system. That seems more fair to me,” Rodriguez said.
 Marquez may not have another high school game in his future, but he’s hoping for a chance at a college career.
 “I’ve been getting messages and emails about colleges for soccer,” Marquez said. “I would really enjoy the opportunity.”
 Despite being a back-line starter, Marquez enjoyed scoring his one goal of the season in the Cowboys’ 6-1 season finale victory against St. Augustine on Friday.
 “I was pretty shocked to get a goal,” he said. “I wasn’t expecting it but it was pretty cool.”
 Marquez lofted a long free kick toward his teammates near the opponents’ goal and the keeper tried to grab it ahead of the Willcox forwards but it slipped through his fingers and into the net.
 His work in Willcox’s back field is what impresses his coach.
 “I think he has to be one of the best defenders in the league,” Rodriguez said. “There’s nobody else like him. He’s fast, covers a lot of field and helps everyone around him.”
 Francisco Felix also had a goal in the final game against St Augustine as well as a score in a previous 3-1 victory over Benson to help the team finish with a 7-1 record in region play.
 “It’s tough to not go to the playoffs after working really hard at practice and at school,” Felix said.“Not going to the playoffs is really hard.”
 He’ll get another shot next year when the squad, according to Rodriguez, should have a good chance.
 “We have a young team and for sure we’ll be a way better team than today,” the coach said.
 “Francisco is really good and really fast,” he added. “He’s learning still but he did really good this year. I’m glad I’m going to have him back.”
 That’s if he can tear him away from his summer job with his dad in Phoenix or the other job at McDonald’s in Willcox.
 “I went to Raymond S. Kelis High in Glendale with 2,000 people as a freshman and you had to try out against 95 people just going out for JV,” Felix said. “So at first I didn’t want to play and skipped for a whole year. When I moved to Willcox my family said you have to play, you’re good, and I said I don’t want to play. I just want to work and make money.”
 His mom stepped in and said he could work in the off season.
 “I’m glad I joined soccer again,” Felix said. “I like involving my teammates and I want everyone to have a chance to score a goal or do something big or make a big play.”
 His teammate on the other end, Marquez, also enjoyed seeing his teammates do well.
 “I think it ended well as we had some players step up for disqualified players this final week,” Marquez said. “I’m really proud of those who stepped up and did really well in those positions.”
 He knows a little about stepping up as he was a surprise from the start of his Willcox career.
 “I was told in practice that as a freshman I would never be a starter that season, but I never gave up and by the second game I was already a starter and stayed as a starter since then,” he said. “Some of my best memories were the bus rides. Long trips with my friends, singing, some dancing, a wonderful time.”

For his 45th documentary feature Frederick Wiseman trains his lens on his native Boston to record all things municipal unfolding in the cement encased corridors of Gerhard Kallmann's infamous Brutalist facade. The retrospective of how we operate and function in the Hub is an engrossing four-and-half-hour watch (yes, you heard that right) that amazingly goes by in a blip and serves as something of an eerie - and taunting - time capsule. Shot during 2018 and 2019, one segment has Mayor Marty Walsh and authorities preparing for the World Champion Red Sox Duck Boat celebration. Later we see fans chanting "Mookie, Mookie, Mookie." Betts famously left us in 2019 and recently performed his heroics in the 2020 World Series for that team we vanquished in 2018 (the Los Angeles Dodgers), and all that Wiseman's camera captures, strangely feels from another era as the city bustles in pre-COVID normalcy - one can only imagine what a 2020-2021 version of "City Hall" might look like.      The Government Center delve unfolds in a series of chapter-esque meanders between the micro and macro with plenty of shots of Boston's iconic skyline and landmarks to root you. The rendering should make plenty of Beantowners proud and Walsh, seemingly ever aware of the camera, comes off crisp, progressive and inclusive - a shining illumination that may pose something of an extra hurdle for upcoming challenger Michelle Wu and others. In Wiseman's classic observant, cinema verite style (fly-on-the-wall) there are several long takes of municipal proceedings such as the budget review where presenters effusively tout the investment in infrastructure as a win-win because it not only betters the community, but also makes the city's debt more appealing to bond investors. It's a cut-and-dry matter that under Wiseman's eye is more interesting and accessible than it sounds, but "City Hall' is most affecting when following the day-to-day operations of front liners, namely the 311 help center workers trying to iron out neighborhood issues or city magistrates mitigating parking tickets - an anxious expecting father who parked in front of a hydrant and an incredulous old-schooler who didn't know there was resident parking along Congress Street - and then there are those out in the community removing trash and providing subsidized veterinary care.      What's truly amazing to note too is that Wiseman, at the age of 90, is still cranking out documentaries on a near annual basis and does all the editing to boot. For those not familiar with the works of the Academy Award-honored documentarian, a law professor at Boston University and Brandeis before picking up the camera, they're slice of life exposes that quietly drink in their subjects without question, preface or prod the way you might get from a Michael Moore ("Roger & Me," or "Fahrenheit 9/11") or Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"). The result conjures an uncanny sense of intimacy; there's no barrier, you are organically and viscerally part of the scene. "City Hall" in scope and focus feels like a natural addition to the director's unofficial community series that began with "Aspen" (1991) and includes "Belfast, Maine" (1999)" and "Jackson Heights" (2015). Must see Wiseman films in my not-so- humble opinion are "Boxing Gym" (2010) and his controversial first film, "Titicut Follies" (1967) about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, which, because of its graphic nature, was banned from being shown in Massachusetts until the early 1990s.      The most moving and telling scenes in "City Hall'' are those steeped in earnest reveals and communal conflict. Talking to veterans afflicted by addiction and PTSD, Walsh candidly shares his dark days as an alcoholic. The connection both onscreen and in the room is immediate and palpable, something that doesn't quite register as much when Walsh underscores his Irish heritage as a bridge to a Latino community. Then there's the Thanksgiving feast for those challenged by Down syndrome and similar arresting disorders where Walsh and crew dutifully serve expectant diners and cap it all off with dancing. Wiseman never lets his lens sway you, but if you don't have a bittersweet bump inside you, you probably didn't flinch when Old Yeller died. The big rub in the film comes during a community outreach meeting run by a predominantly Asian coalition of businessmen seeking to institute a recreational cannabis facility in a predominantly Black and brown section of Dorchester. The two sides talk at each other, the rhetoric's tinged with the annoyance of not being heard and there's the clear fear of being taken advantage of, with the city and the Massachusetts Canabis Control Commission - who are not in the room - taking the brunt of the shots. It's a telling back and forth that raises the question of equitable economic development and how to earnestly empower a community in the process without gutting them.      One of the things that makes Wiseman's films so captivating is the sense of cadence and human rhythm he imbues them with. "Boxing Gym" and his 2009 ballet troupe portrait "La danse" are driven by repetition and pursuit of form. In "City Hall" there are mesmerizing long takes of mattresses and barbecue grills being obliterated and compacted by a garbage truck's compressor and long spindly tree limbs are methodically pulled in and consumed by a restless wood shredder - activities quite mundane and everyday, that in Wiseman's purview magically become hypnotic wonderments. Also too, Wiseman's longtime collaborator, cinematographer John Davey artfully finds Escher-esque motifs and reflections within reflections amid our familiar facades. His upward angled framings cut aesthetic portraits of old Scollay Square and the bland Saltonstall building in ways one might not have imagined possible. "City Hall" in the end, is a dutiful reflection of who we are, where we came from and a piquant insider look into the vast municipal neural net that keeps us humming as a community.
