Britain was still holding off on changes to its lockdown as the coronavirus- related death toll in hospitals was on target to surge past 20,000. It's the fourth highest in Europe, behind Italy — with nearly 26,000 deaths — and Spain and France, both with more than 22,000.


  In France, the government is preparing to gingerly ease one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns from May 11. The health minister detailed plans Saturday to scale up testing to help contain any new flare-ups.


  Testing shortages are a critical problem elsewhere, too, including in Brazil, Latin America’s largest nation, which is veering closer to becoming a pandemic hot spot.


  Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and four other major cities warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or already overwhelmed. In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day — triple the pre-virus average.
