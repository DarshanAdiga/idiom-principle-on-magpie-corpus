But what's nevertheless true is that in their business dealings, many titans of industry and finance are increasingly detached from any single locale or nation-state, and they live lives more and more insulated from the struggles of ordinary people in their countries of origin. (Applause.) And their decisions – their decisions to shut down a manufacturing plant, or to try to minimize their tax bill by shifting profits to a tax haven with the help of high-priced accountants or lawyers, or their decision to take advantage of lower-cost immigrant labor, or their decision to pay a bribe – are often done without malice; it's just a rational response, they consider, to the demands of their balance sheets and their shareholders and competitive pressures.

In past presidential cycles, and even for Senate and gubernatorial races, residents of both parties have traveled across state lines to campaign. California GOP strategist Mike Madrid said he remembers droves of Northern California Republicans and Democrats taking multiday trips to Nevada to do outreach in 2016.
 This election cycle, many campaigns and organizations shifted to mostly online outreach in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Though the Trump campaign never paused in-person outreach, Biden’s team followed public health guidelines and is only recently starting door-knocking in battleground states including Nevada, Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Polling shows Biden is leading Trump in Arizona, which hasn’t chosen a Democrat in a presidential race since 1996.
 Advocacy groups, labor unions and politically aligned organizations filled in by hiring canvassers in another battleground state, Arizona. Many are from California, whose residents also  donate millions to Democratic and Republican candidates in competitive races in other states.
 “Active campaign volunteers are smart enough to know California is not up for grabs in a presidential race, and if they want to help elect Joe Biden on the ground, they need to work in another state,” said Rose Kapolczynski, a Democratic campaign consultant. She added that although phone-banking is effective, the most persuasive form of campaigning happens at the doors.

And how we achieve this is going to vary country to country, and I know your new president is committed to rolling up his sleeves and trying to do so.

That was tried; it didn't work very well. For almost all countries, progress is going to depend on an inclusive market-based system – one that offers education for every child; that protects collective bargaining and secures the rights of every worker – (applause) – that breaks up monopolies to encourage competition in small and medium-sized businesses; and has laws that root out corruption and ensures fair dealing in business; that maintains some form of progressive taxation so that rich people are still rich but they're giving a little bit back to make sure that everybody else has something to pay for universal health care and retirement security, and invests in infrastructure and scientific research that builds platforms for innovation.

“The Turner Diaries,” a novel broadly known as the bible of the racist right, articulates this hatred of the American government. Published serially in the 1970s in the racist magazine Attack!, the novel frames the U.S. government as controlled by Jews waging a race war against white people. Overthrowing the government is the central goal of the protagonists, and the novel often shows up on domestic terrorist reading lists. One such terrorist, Timothy J. McVeigh, had photocopies of the novel in his truck when he bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, imitating a bombing in the novel.
 These ideas, along with the growth of a conspiracy theory claiming that elites are systematically enacting an anti-white strategy called the “Great Replacement,” have been the ideological trigger behind domestic terrorism in recent years.
 Mass shootings in Charleston, S.C., Pittsburgh, El Paso and Christchurch, New Zealand, were carried out by men radicalized online by these fears. Although they are often called “lone wolf” attacks, individual acts of terrorism are part of a white nationalist strategy called leaderless resistance that encourages individuals to commit acts of violence against Jews, people of color, or the state.
 Former Department of Homeland Security analyst Daryl Johnson, an expert on domestic terrorism, has warned for over a decade that these iterations of violence are only likely to grow. His team was disbanded after publishing a report on the threats posed by right-wing extremism, which led to a broad outcry by conservative politicians.

BEIRUT (AP) — Wildfires around the Middle East triggered by a heatwave hitting the region have killed two people, forced thousands of people to leave their homes and detonated landmines along the Lebanon-Israel border, state media and officials said Saturday. The areas hit by the heatwave are Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian territories. The fires come amid an intense heatwave that is unusual for this time of the year. Wildfires spread across different areas of Israel and the West Bank for a second day Saturday, forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Israeli Police said in a statement firefighters and police forces evacuated 5,000 residents from the city of Nof Hagalil in northern Israel. One of the hardest hit countries is war-torn Syria where fires have killed two people and left dozens suffering from breathing problems over the past two days. The wildfires also burnt wide areas of forests, mostly in the central province of Homs and the coastal province of Latakia. With fire fighters overwhelmed, some residents helped them using primitive methods such as carrying water in buckets and pouring them on the fire. Director of the Forestry Department in Latakia Agricultural Department, Bassem Douba, was quoted as saying by state news agency, SANA, that the number of fires reached 85 in different sites. Also in Latakia province, fires in President Bashar Assad’s hometown of Qardaha heavily damaged a building used as a storage for the state-owned tobacco company, part of which collapsed. In Lebanon, firefighters backed by army helicopters fought fires in the country’s north, center and south.

While counties have traditionally overlooked non-English speaking and other marginalized communities in their emergency planning and response, Sonoma County’s alert page now includes a Spanish-language version. Regardless, community advocates say, there is still more outreach work to be done.
 Once the fire was reported, other aspects of the county’s updated response rolled out, Godley said. The emergency operations center was up and running within an hour, along with the first messages to foothill and isolated residents to pack up and either get ready to leave, or just flat-out go. Because the county had already broken up Santa Rosa and surrounding areas into evacuation zones, they could quickly pick areas to alert instead of having to carve out their targets street by street.
 Despite the area’s recent history of fires, including the massive Kincade fire that threatened communities for weeks last year, some residents still refused to heed evacuation orders and had to be rescued or shuttled out later by ambulance, officials said.

The Storm, meanwhile, keeps rolling on. It has won titles during three presidential administrations (Bush, Obama and Trump) and with four coaches (Anne Donovan, Brian Agler, Dan Hughes and Gary Kloppenburg).
 The Storm’s titles can be divided into distinct halves — the two with Lauren Jackson as the catalyst (2004, 2010), and the two with Breanna Stewart as the driving force (2018, 2020).
 The one constant tying them all together, of course, is Sue Bird — and let’s take a moment to reflect on her legacy. It’s not a stretch to call Bird the greatest winner in Seattle sports history. She belongs in the pantheon of the city’s all-time greats — among the Griffeys, the Paytons, the Wilsons.
 To watch Bird this postseason, a year after missing the 2019 season because of a knee injury, and after a 2020 season in which the knee flared up at various times, was to see an athlete will herself to greatness. She set a WNBA assists record with 16 in the opener and orchestrated the Storm offense that won each game over Las Vegas by an average of 19.7 points.
 Closing in on 40 (her birthday is Oct. 16), Bird was as essential to the Storm’s three-game sweep of Las Vegas last week as she was to its two-games- to-one triumph over the Connecticut Sun in 2004, its three-game sweep of the Atlanta Dream in 2010 and its three-game sweep of the Washington Mystics in 2018.
 Speaking of which, the Storm doesn't tiptoe to a title. It storms — yes, pun intended — right in. Since losing the opener in 2014, the Storm has won 11 consecutive Finals games and is 25-3 in the playoffs in its championship seasons. This year’s success came as the Storm, inside the WNBA’s bubble in Bradenton, Florida, advocated for social justice.
