This annual event that started by the Kiwanis Club of Apache Junction, has grown to be one of our biggest fundraisers. All net proceeds are donated back to the community, usually back to Apache Junction Unified School District (AJUSD). This partnership allows a local non-profit and a local event to not only showcase the talent that our kids in our community have but to rally behind a need for our schools.


  By providing our kids with a stage, a microphone, and an audience, we give them one of the most valuable lessons possible in life. The lesson of facing one’s fears, in the judgment of the world and at the end of the day knowing that even if you do not walk away a victor, you walk away victorious because you had the courage and bravery to do it. This is a lesson that one can not simply teach, but one has to show.


  Being in its third year, we are beginning to hear such remarks as “I look forward to this event!” or “It brings me the confidence to know that I can do this as a career or even a fun hobby!” Having those words come from our youth is truly one of the most rewarding things that you can hear.

Conventional wisdom holds that China will surpass the United States in the long term due to its economic momentum and increasingly innovative economy. But this wisdom underestimates America’s unique structural advantages in innovation that will enable the United States to lead China across a range of strategic and emerging technologies. The United States and its allies therefore should not fear selective technological disengagement, in which U.S.-centric and Chinese-centric systems for research and development, production, and use of certain technologies are increasingly separated. Rather, Washington should see technology as a legitimate and favorable domain of competition.

For the third year in a row, Apache Junction/ Gold Canyon kids have shined in a yearly event known as AJ Kids Idol. I have no doubt in my mind you’ve heard of American Idol or America's Got Talent. Well, this yearly event, that I have the personal pleasure in helping put on, is one of the best events of the year. I might be a tad bit biased when I say that, but I truly believe that any event that plays host to showcasing our local kids and the talent that they have is bar none the best of the best.


  For the last three years, the Kiwanis Club of Apache Junction has held auditions and hosted this yearly competition. Crowning three victors: the best talent K-6, the best talent 7-12, and the fan-favorite. Traditionally held at Barleens Dinner Theatre this annual January event showcases the up and coming generation doing truly inspiring things.


  As a former theatre kid myself, I can not begin to tell you how awestruck I am by these kids. Their level of bravery when it comes to getting on a stage at the ages 8-18 years old and performing in front of 300+ strangers while being judged on a variety of factors (except cuteness) and doing so with such gumption is truly one of my yearly highlights.

Want Winchester news delivered to your inbox? Sign up for our free weekly newsletter.


  The Winchester Star recently introduced a new feature, "Volunteer of the Week," where we profile community members who have helped make a positive impact as volunteers. This week's spotlight is on Winchester resident Joi Loewy, a volunteer at Women's Lunch Place.


  We want to cover what matters to our readers. If there is something else you think we should be reporting on, or someone else we should talk to, please let us know here.


  Tell us about your volunteer work. What do you do, and where do you do it?


  I have the privilege of volunteering at the Women's Lunch Place located in Boston's Back Bay at 67 Newbury St. It is a safe, welcoming day shelter community for women experiencing poverty and homelessness. It first opened its door in 1982 and is now open six days a week, providing breakfast and lunch served restaurant style, as well as providing critical support services.


  I volunteer in the kitchen one Saturday a month serving breakfast to over 250 guests. We prep fresh produce and protein for lunch and meals planned for the upcoming week. Volunteers get to do a little bit of everything, helping where ever is most needed, which is the very reason why I love it so much! We get to be very hands on. Chef/Kitchen Manager Sherry Hughes makes everything from scratch so the meals are not only healthy… they are absolutely delicious. (P.S. Last November, Chef Sherry was a contestant on the show "Chopped" …very exciting!)


  How did you get started?


  I first learned of WLP through my church, the Winchester Unitarian Society through our Social Action and Justice Committee. I had been looking for volunteer opportunities where I could be hands on and stay local. From the very first Saturday I volunteered I was hooked. It spoke to my soul and I knew I was in the right place. We have four slots to fill on our shift, so any time there is room for me I go. It has been a wonderful way for me to get to know other church members and staff as we stand side by side, chopping, dicing and serving this beautiful food.


  What keeps you coming back?


  What keeps me coming back to WLP are the women we serve and the inherent worth and dignity they deserve. The feeling of warmth and inclusiveness makes it a safe, welcoming place for all its guests and you get that impression the moment you walk through the door. I am always so impressed by their attention to details such as serving meals restaurant style on china plates and having fresh flowers on every table. It's also a lot of fun. You never know what the menu is going to be. On any given morning we could be removing the seeds from two cases of pomegranates, chopping/spinning 20 heads of lettuce for salad, and marinating 10 pork loins.


  Is there a volunteer experience that stood out to you, or where you feel like you made a significant impact?


  The experience of arriving at 7 a.m. and helping to make all that needs to happen to serve more than 350 guests for the day is amazing to me. To see the impact WLP has on the guests is the most rewarding part. They are tired, cold, hungry and stressed. They can get a shower, wash their clothes, take a nap and have a meal. As they say at WLP "lunch is more than a meal". I've never left once without hearing a guest thanking a volunteer for being there. They don't have to do that, but they do and I hear it over and over during my shift.


  What's your life like in Winchester? Are you a lifelong resident or recent arrival?


  My husband John and I have lived in Winchester in the Muraco School neighborhood for 27 years and raised our two daughters. Our youngest daughter is the only true "New Englander" in the family - she was born at Winchester Hospital 25 years ago. It is also where I have worked for past 11 years. Can't beat the commute! Winchester's ideal location puts us within 10 miles of Boston and all the city has to offer and easy access to miles of trails in the Middlesex Fells right in our own backyard where are family has spent countless hours hiking and walking the dogs. We feel very blessed to call Winchester home for the past 27 years.


  If you know someone who should be recognized for their service, please send an email to athoma@wickedlocal.com. We look forward to hearing from you.

_Editor’s Note: I have had many conversations lately about what it means to “buy American” in a global economy. It is popular sentiment (and I believe rightly so) to boost our nation’s economy and help support our neighbors by purchasing the goods we need from companies located in the USA. It’s just common sense._
  _But, I have learned over the years that, if it sounds simple, there’s probably a lot more questions to be asked! Companies that we “know” to be owned by US citizens and/or corporations, may very well build their products entirely in Mexico - or China, or Korea. And foreign owned companies may source and build entirely in the United States. And a product labeled “Made in America” are often assembled here from parts made in other countries._

But in light of Burisma's role in the unfolding political saga -- in which Trump pushed Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, who had served on Burisma's board -- the probing of the company's systems closely resembles Russian efforts in 2016 to destabilize the US election.

Yet the measures above will still force America to endure some temporary costs and restructuring efforts. As argued previously in _War on the Rocks_ , U.S. companies that export strategic technologies and knowledge to China will have to adjust both their Chinese market product offerings and their research, development, and manufacturing practices at China-based facilities to focus on less sensitive technologies. But U.S. businesses may eventually offset any losses in Chinese market sales through growth in alternative markets. Supply chains will diversify as U.S. and foreign companies shift production outside of China, with restructuring costs declining over time as economies of scale are reached. The chief U.S. vulnerability is whether Washington has the political will to endure this short-term pain.

KHARTOUM -- Armed ex-security agents linked to Sudan's toppled ruler Omar al- Bashir fought soldiers in the capital Khartoum for hours until government forces quelled the revolt late on Tuesday, residents and a military source said.


  The violence was the biggest confrontation so far between the old guard and supporters of the new administration, which helped topple Bashir in April after 30 years in power.


  The former employees of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) also shut two small oilfields in Darfur in protest about their severance packages, a government source told Reuters. They had an output of around 5,000 barrels per day.


  Late Tuesday, soldiers seized back control of all buildings where ex-NISS agents had hours earlier opened fire on government forces, a military source told Reuters.


  The former NISS staff surrendered after negotiations, the source said.


  Restructuring the once feared security apparatus blamed for suppressing dissent under Bashir was among the key demands of the uprising that forced his removal.


  However, once dismissed by the new transitional government, many of the security agents returned to their barracks without being disarmed after leaving the ministries and streets they once controlled.


  Residents said the clashes broke out at noon between the former security staff and forces loyal to the transitional government in a northern district of Khartoum where gunfire could be heard for hours.


  In a second location next to the airport, ex-NISS staff seized a security building, which was then surrounded by government forces and where gunfire could also be heard, witnesses said.


  Four people suffered gunshot wounds but were in stable condition, a doctors' committee linked to the civilian government said in a statement.


  Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan's most powerful paramilitary group, which supports the new government, said while he would not consider Tuesday's incident a coup attempt, any such action would not be tolerated.


  "We will not accept any coup, we will not accept any illegal change. The only change will come from the Sudanese people," he said before his troops helped end the revolt.


  AIRSPACE CLOSED


  Information Minister Faisal Mohamed Saleh said the gunmen were former employees angry at the terms they had been offered upon their dismissal.


  Authorities closed Sudan's airspace for five hours as a precautionary measure after the start of the shooting, a Civil Aviation Ministry spokesman said.


  Dagalo said that former Sudan intelligence chief Salah Gosh and a member of Bashir's old ruling party was behind the NISS unrest.


  "This is a coordinated plan by Salah Gosh and another member of the National Congress party including some generals from intelligence service," he told a news conference during a visit to South Sudan's capital Juba on Tuesday.


  "The person behind this shooting today is Salah Gosh. He has many generals active within the security sector with an aim to create confusion and fighting."


  Gosh, believed to be in Egypt, could not be immediately reached for comment.

Years later, following allegations from others about the contract she signed with the brand, she tweeted, "I signed my contract with TF back then because I was naive & didn't know better. at the end of the day, I signed it, it's my own fault-- but what I'll never forgive is that 'allegedly' they changed the palette's quality behind my back. 1000's of negative reviews & I was clueless."


  "I had to see all these negative reviews, while the palettes I had were outstanding," she tweeted in 2019\. "'They lying in their videos to get views' is what I was told. I don't care about the money.. but I had to fight YEARS to prove my authenticity and gain your trust again." Too Faced has not addressed those previous allegations.

Few franchises have been as intertwined over the last quarter-century as the Green Bay Packers and San Francisco 49ers, with coaches getting groomed in one spot and ending up in the other, seven previous playoff meetings, and a regrettable draft decision that sent Rodgers packing for Green Bay instead of staying close to home and reviving the 49ers.

So the 2019 season became validation in that respect, with the way the two programs jockeyed with each other in the polls. And especially how things shook out today.


  App State finished No. 18 in the USA Today coaches poll and No. 19 in the AP top 25 — above Boise State in both (Nos. 22 and 23). It’s the first time in the Mountaineers’ FBS history that they’ve ended a season ranked. They’re also the first Sun Belt team to accomplish that.


  The comparison has been a natural one between the two mountain schools, both former I-AA/FCS powers that made their moves up and found different forms of success. And Benson was never afraid to draw it during his tenure leading the Sun Belt, which ended last summer.


  “I don’t know if I was nervous,” Benson told the Journal in October when asked about making the parallel. “I’m sure some people thought it was all talk.”


  And Benson was the guy who could accurately make it. He’s a Boise State graduate. As commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference (from 1994 to 2012), he watched Boise State join the league in 2001 and then leave for the Mountain West Conference after the 2010 season, the year after it won its second Fiesta Bowl.


  Boise State moved up to then-Division I-A in 1997, finding a steady stream of success. But the stretch to which Benson alluded in 2013 — which started with Dan Hawkins in the head coaching spot and finished with Chris Petersen — gave Boise State its breakthrough. Plus, for the time being, it gave the conference a crown jewel.


  Benson inherited a Sun Belt with staple programs such as Arkansas State and Louisiana. But thanks to many similarities, he quickly saw the promise App State had.


  First, he felt good about the facilities he first visited the campus. To him, App State was ahead of Boise State in that department when the latter joined the WAC. Appalachian had just completed the start of renovations to Kidd Brewer Stadium, which included the addition of the athletics tower behind the west-side stands.

Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to try to drill down into the cost side once again. I guess if you're looking at an uptick in core expenses in the first quarter, it implies a pretty substantial downdraft through the remainder of the year just to keep us in the ballpark of this year's adjusted $53.7 billion. I mean did the plan, indeed, call for such an absolute improvement in costs and what sort of the path to get there, especially at a time when there is so much discussion on investments? Just curious to your thoughts there.

Well, so it's not unreasonable in the sense that it captures the seasonal volatility of some of these things that tend to ebb and flow throughout the course of the year and we've -- if we've adjusted out things that we've sold in both from a gain perspective as well as the run rate perspective and it captures that where we do have elements as you'll note that ebb and flow relatively meaningfully from not just from quarter-to-quarter but from year- to-year. And so we have had equity market tailwinds as you mentioned that we might continue to but that will come and go. I think sort of tend to look at a slightly longer time horizon on some of those line items and think about what the average has been over five quarters or so since we reported in five quarters, it's easy enough to. There's nothing unreasonable about that approach. There are some of these that we believe that even while we're doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we're in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that.

Derek McInnes' side may look back ruefully at referee Steven McLean's decision not to award them a penalty when Craig Gordon collided with Graeme Shinnie.
 But they will likely also reflect on their slow start to a fantastic contest, with Celtic apparently out of sight within 11 minutes.
 Patrick Roberts signalled an early warning when he escaped and tested Joe Lewis, but that was not heeded and Griffiths' deep corner was headed in by an unchallenged Boyata.
 Wonderful Griffiths skill created the second, the striker escaping on the right and feeding Callum McGregor. His shot was blocked by Shay Logan, but Armstrong was on hand to slam in a composed finish.
 It quickly got even worse for Aberdeen. Griffiths turned, fired powerfully from distance and found the net, although Lewis should have done better than help the ball into his top-right corner.

Alongside traffic and coffee, news radio is a staple of my morning commute. As I flip through the stations, I’ll sometimes hear a pundit lament that “Nothing is made in America anymore.”
 In reality, there are nearly 13 million manufacturing workers in the United States, including thousands in Arizona. Some of these folks are employed by U.S.-based firms. Many others work for companies headquartered abroad.
 These international companies employ more than 108,000 Arizonans. That includes 24,300 employees in manufacturing jobs – or nearly 22 percent of all Arizona jobs created by international companies.
 According to the latest government data, the number of Arizona jobs created by international companies jumped by 35 percent over the past five years. For comparison, the number of private-sector jobs overall in Arizona increased by 15 percent.
 Arizona isn’t an anomaly. International companies created 62 percent of new manufacturing jobs in the United States over the past five years, according to the latest available government data. More than 770 different international companies employ Arizona workers. Many of them are household names, including Anheuser-Busch, BP, and DHL.
 International firms pay better. Americans who work for global companies earn 26 percent more compensation than the average worker in the same geographic area, according to a new analysis from the National Bureau of Economic Research.
 International companies benefit all workers, not just the ones they employ directly. When an international firm sets up a manufacturing plant and creates 1,000 new jobs in America, workers in that geographic area at domestic firms experience a collective $16 million boost in wages. So for every local job that an international firm creates, the wage pool for employees in the area increases to the tune of $16,000 annually.
 International companies also benefit U.S. small businesses. Over the past decade and a half, international companies increased the amount of business they do with U.S. suppliers by nearly 30 percent – jumping from $1.5 trillion to $2.4 trillion, after adjusting for inflation.
 In the manufacturing sector, business between international companies and domestic suppliers rose by nearly 70 percent during that same period. That is more than 14 times greater than the overall growth rate achieved by all U.S. businesses.

Since the U.S. economy is not dependent on Chinese technology — with some exceptions — China has few viable long-term measures to counter a technology cost-imposition strategy. Beijing would likely continue with existing legal and illegal practices to acquire U.S. technology, knowhow, and talent, and increase harassment of U.S. firms and businessmen. An instinctive Chinese reaction to accelerate relatively inefficient top-down plans may be counterproductive. In nascent fields, such as artificial intelligence, decentralized efforts are likely superior to centralized ones due to continued uncertainty over the specific research paths that will ultimately bear fruit. Encouraging these innate self-defeating tendencies is at the heart of competitive strategy.

Again Lady Titans fought back to within 51-37 after three quarters. In the quarter, Artman paced the Chargers with seven points, Harrell had four points and Ray tossed in two points during the quarter.


  The Chargers flexed their muscles and put the game away in the fourth quarter by outscoring the Lady Titans 20-4. A Chargers run of five points behind a Harrell free throw, a Smith jumper and Harrell hoop, followed by another 10-0 run was keyed by five straight points from Artman.


  Madi Cole canned a three pointer and followed with two free throws on the next possession. Marie DeSotel added made free throws and the Chargers won the game 71-41.


  “We are headed in the right direction,” said Charger coach Grant Surprenant after the game. “I thought we really focused and executed our game plan from start to finish. We knew they were going to be physical and had a good post player in the Gillen girl. Megan did a great job on her. I challenged her to guard their best player and she executed it. Offensively, we were clicking. Caydee started out to get us going and then Karli and Megan followed. We are going to need that. I thought our bench had another good game. It is good to see the girls competing and grinding it out defensively and then offensively moving the ball and sharing the basketball.”


  For the game, Artman led the way with 21 points. Harrell added 20 points, Kirkham netted 16 points, Cole had five points, Smith put in four points, Ray and DeSotel finished with two points each and Wood with one point.

GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemala's new president, Alejandro Giammattei, discussed how to curb illegal immigration and improve border security in a meeting with officials of the Trump administration before he was due to take office on Tuesday, as Washington pushes Giammattei to accept an asylum agreement.


  A conservative former surgeon and ex-prison chief, Giammattei, 63, ran for top office three times before his victory in an August runoff on a tough-on- crime platform that included returning the death penalty.


  "We will bring back the peace this country so dearly needs," Giammattei told reporters on Monday, promising to overhaul the Central American nation's security forces and restructure ministries.


  But at the top of his to-do list will be a decision on whether to roll back or expand an agreement with the United States forged by outgoing President Jimmy Morales that makes Guatemala a buffer zone to reduce U.S. asylum claims.


  U.S. Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf, part of the U.S. delegation headed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for the inauguration, was expected to push Giammattei to expand the agreement to include Mexicans.


  In a sign of the urgency of the relationship, Giammattei met with Wolf and Ross in his first bilateral meeting on Tuesday morning. Giammattei said in a tweet that he and Ross discussed investment and economic growth to stem immigration.


  The U.S. embassy said Wolf talked to Giammattei about curbing illegal migration and improving border security, and that the U.S. International Development Finance Corp would sign a memorandum of understanding on Wednesday with Guatemala to spur $1 billion in private-sector investment and create jobs.


  In another step likely to please the Trump administration, Giammattei signaled he would keep his country's embassy in Israel in Jerusalem.


  Guatemala is one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations, with poverty rising since 2000 despite strong economic growth rates, according to the World Bank. U.S. officials have previously threatened it with economic consequences if it does not accept the Asylum Cooperation Agreement.


  Giammattei, who previously suggested he would seek to change the agreement, appeared to soften his stance on Monday, saying he had not yet seen the deal's details.


  Guatemala is central to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating efforts to end illegal immigration and asylum claims from people making their way to the southwestern U.S. border.


  Under the deal, implemented in November, the United States sends Hondurans and Salvadorans seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to Guatemala to ask for refuge there instead.


  As of Friday, 128 Salvadoran and Honduran asylum seekers had been sent under the agreement, according to Guatemalan data. Only a few have applied for asylum in a country that is itself a major source of U.S.-bound migrants. Others have returned home.


  CRIME AND CORRUPTION


  Giammattei takes office as the nation suffers from the effects of drug trafficking on politics, and distrust sowed by last year's departure of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption body.


  Another looming decision will be whether to act on the recommendation of a congressional panel last week that judges and investigators who worked with the anti-corruption body, known as CICIG, be arrested.


  CICIG helped topple sitting President Otto Perez on corruption charges in 2015 and put dozens of politicians and businessmen behind bars, before a backlash led Morales to drive the body from Guatemala in September.


  Morales, himself investigated by the agency on election financing charges he denies, is due to be sworn into the Central American Parliament a few hours after he leaves office, in a position offering him immunity.


  On the bright side, Guatemala's homicide rate is down - to 22 murders per 100,000 residents in 2018, from 45 per 100,000 in 2009.


  But the freedom with which drug traffickers influence politics is a challenge. Ahead of last year's election, presidential candidate and occasional Morales ally Mario Estrada was arrested in Miami on charges of seeking funding from drug cartels and conspiring to assassinate rivals.


  "We realized that narco-trafficking here is among the most intense in the region," Luis Hernandez Azmitia, an outgoing congressional representative of the Movimiento Reformador party told Reuters.

Yeah. So unrealized gains are harder to come by these days, because we tend to realize them on a faster basis since the accounting change. I guess, now a year and a half ago, but it used to be the case that we'd have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises. If I set a higher level of valuation, we recognize the gain from that as it goes along and so when the ultimate realization occurs that there is less of a pop because we've ratcheted up we've taken gains along the way. So that's led to more of a, call it, front-end loading over the last several quarters of benefit from that portfolio and it will increase the volatility if people have down capital raise rounds or things don't go as well when companies are actually sold or taken public. So it's been a great business, the returns are solid. But the accounting change has caused being revenue recognition to be a little bit more choppy. Although in the early quarters, it's actually been very strong.

“People were telling me, ‘hey you know you should think about opening a business for Taekwondo’,” he said. “(They told me) ’a lot of the kids love it, and it’d be a very good thing here.’”

What started off with just four students now has 53 individuals looking to hone their ability to defend themselves, and not all of them are just children.

  This testing is something that everybody — instructors and students — must do in order to progress to the next degree of belt. Yet the tests and lessons he teaches aren’t just physical.


  “We help the families at home,” he said. “Every test we do, we have something called an evaluation paper. The (student’s) parents have to sign it and their teacher has to sign it. If their grades are not where I want them, I don’t want them to test. They are going to stay where they are until they fix their grades. Or, if they are disobedient to mom or dad, they don’t test. High standards are what we teach.”


  Hanini also explained that for one youth class in particular they teach the meaning of certain words and how to incorporate them into their lives.


  “For the Dragon Class, which starts from 4 to 6 years of age…we teach them a word,” he said. “For January, the word is respect. Next month is confidence. Third (month) is self-disclipline, and so on.”


  One major thing he stressed was how Taekwondo was to be used.


  “We don’t promote violence,” he said. “A lot of parents think, ‘I don’t want to sign my son or daughter up because it’s violent’…we don’t teach violence, we teach self-defense and discipline. It’s actually better and good because we work with parents at home and work with schools. And that reflects when they come out here because they have self-discipline and self-esteem, courtesy, and respect. We help them establish those.”


  “And that’s what I want everyone to realize,” he continued. “It builds strength, and we teach against bullying. I don’t allow any bullying done by my students. And we teach our students to stand up against it.”


  His studio does hold seminars and he has students who compete in tournaments in Boise and Utah, as well as nationals in Las Vegas. He would also like to hold a tournament this year at his location, but so far doesn’t have any official plans.


  Hanini’s studio used to be located at a different site, but when the opportunity arose for him to snatch his current location at 176 Idaho Street, which included more space for a second business, Hanini jumped at the chance.


  He opened up a salon in the same building and has been trimming hair since 2017.


  But why hairdressing?

Good morning. I'm sure you're a little tired of all the expense question kind of near term, I do want to ask though longer term on costs. Charlie, you said about being best-in-class efficiency and I guess, just how do you define that and I think a lot of investors and analysts think of your direct peers is being like Bank of America, JPMorgan, maybe U.S. Bank as well, but are you kind of being literal like your efficiency ratio, it should be in the ballpark or better than theirs. And if it is, it's just a -- it's a bold comment given where you are coming from and obviously reflects, I assume optimism on both cost and revenue, but maybe you could just elaborate on some of those themes. Thank you.

Dodatkowo strażnicy polecają tzw. rule of thumb - jeśli widać na szlaku dziką zwierzynę albo innych ludzi - wyciągamy kciuk, zamykamy jedno oko i sprawdzamy, czy cały kciuk ich zakrywa. Jesli nie, to znak, że jesteśmy zbyt blisko i powinniśmy dać sobie trochę przestrzeni. Wyprawa tam jest niesamowita nie tylko ze względu na krajobraz (jak na tym filmie z drona), ale przede wszystkim przez fakt, że jesteśmy "sami ze sobą", a dziesiątki mil w każdą ze stron nie ma żywej duszy (przynajmniej w teorii).

Beyond channel support, connectivity is another key factor you should look at when buying a soundbar. Most include standard wired audio ports for connecting to a TV or other media device. The most common connections are Toslink optical and HDMI ARC. In addition to wired ports, most soundbars also now support wireless connectivity, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi for easy music streaming from a mobile device or music service like Spotify, Tidal, or Apple Music.

While it is true that Scarlett Johansson has been famous for a while and is old hat at the awards show thing, the 92nd Academy Awards will in a way be new to her as well. Despite arguably deserving it many times over before, Scarlett Johansson received her first ever Oscar nominations this year and not only that, she got two of them.
