"I'm hopeful that by the time we get a few days into this, we will see widespread compliance and there will be no need (to ticket). People will do the right thing because it's the right thing to do as opposed to us having to hand out a bunch of tickets."

At Clemson, whose student population is 6% African American, there have been uncomfortable conversations in recent weeks between Black football players — who make up a majority of the roster — and coach Dabo Swinney, who had to explain why he wore a “Football Matters” T-shirt and did not discipline a white assistant coach who once used a racial slur.
 “There’s a higher threshold to push the envelope with Black athletes, and this is no different,” said Hasan Kwame Jeffries, an African American history professor at Ohio State and a Morehouse alumnus. “It’s important to point out that we’re not talking about lacrosse and pistol here, we’re talking about football, which is disproportionately African American, especially in the biggest conferences. Why are we even considering playing if we’re truly concerned with this being a disaster?”
 Or, as Billy Hawkins, a professor of health and human performance at the University of Houston, said of college football workouts continuing across the country while infections surge: “It’s a prime example of Black lives not mattering.”
 Players at the University of Arizona seem to have reached a similar conclusion after the school announced Tuesday that football workouts would continue despite President Robert C. Robbins saying recently that he would not allow on-campus classes if the fall semester were beginning now.

Hamilton has not won in Austria since 2016 and only has a longer streak without victory in Australia of the circuits that were on last year's calendar.
 Team-mate Valtteri Bottas triumphed in 2017, before Verstappen's double wins came amid Mercedes woe over the last two years, including major cooling issues in the 2019 race.
 "We've not been terrible [since 2017], but it is a challenging circuit with the height of the circuit, the temperatures that we see," added Hamilton.
 "We've arrived here [in previous years] and it's usually kind of not in the perfect window of operating temperatures for our car.
 "But I'd like to think we're in a better position this year with improvements that we've made for this season's car. So, time will tell."
 Bottas was also in an optimistic mood as he looks to push six-time world champion Hamilton closer this year.
 "I was pretty happy when I heard there was going to be two races here, I like this track," he said.
 "Historically, if you look in the past, I've also had tracks that have not been very successful but I've still been able to be good there.
 "It's tricky to say anything from the past - it's a new season after a long break. But I feel I've had good preparations within myself and with the team - so that's why I do feel confident.
 "Very soon we'll see where we are as a team and also me personally pace-wise."

But San Francisco can make up for it at kicker. Robbie Gould might not have a powerful leg, but it is accurate (at least it has been over the course of his career). Arizona’s Zane Gonzales has a bigger leg and knocked through 88 percent of his kicks last year — he’s probably the best kicker in the division. Seattle’s Jason Myers is pretty good, too — the Seahawks stay in the running. But the Rams fall off here — they appear to be going with a rookie out of Miami-Ohio this season.

On June 29, Snively and Chronister voted against a seven-day renewal for the executive order, while Lott favored, but not without making it a point to say he did so out of respect for the collaborative efforts of his fellow EPG members. Still, he added, “I don’t like mandates, I’ve been crystal clear about that.”

I’d argue that offensive line play at the NFL level has never been worse, but you’d never know that if you only watched the 49ers. San Francisco’s two tackles, Trent Williams and Mike McGlinchey, are far and away the best in the division. Laken Tomlinson is a solid performer any team would want at guard. Center and right guard are question marks going into the season, but the Niners have solid options at both spots. Weston Richburg, if healthy, is a plus performer at center. Ben Garland, his backup — and perhaps the Week 1 starter — is better than replacement level.

That said, I’ll take Fred Warner, Kwon Alexander, and — the trump card — Dre Greenlaw over what Seattle has. Warner is one of the five or six best linebackers in the NFL himself — the perfect encapsulation of a modern Mike with his elite coverage skills, all while maintaining the ability to stop the run.

I like the Rams’ new one-two punch of Darrell Henderson and rookie Cam Akers. Both backs are perfect scheme fits for the outside zone scheme that Sean McVay runs. But it’s all projection with those two. That said, I wouldn’t be surprised that if, at the end of the season, we view the Rams’ rushing attack as elite. It should also be noted that the Rams have outstanding depth with Malcolm Brown and John Kelly behind those two youngsters.

The Niners’ third receiver is the loser of the No. 2 battle with slot receiver Trent Taylor now in the mix. Are any of them better than Christian Kirk or Andy Isabella in Arizona? What about Josh Reynolds in LA? Maybe they’re better than Philip Dorsett and David Moore in Seattle, but that’s a close call.

Before the looting occurred, it seemed to be well telegraphed and widely expected among many in Peoria. In court documents, the FBI said some of the looters had used Facebook to rally and coordinate people to converge on certain retailers and a mall.
 In all, 27 businesses were burglarized, 14 other properties were damaged, and there were several reports of arson, according to the FBI.
 One of those businesses was Kelly Beauty Supply, which boasts “the largest selection of wigs in Peoria.”
 Kelly Park, 44, opened the shop three years ago, thinking a smaller city like Peoria would be less competitive than Chicago, where she and her husband had settled after immigrating from South Korea in their 20s.
 In a shopping plaza next to a Walmart, Kelly Beauty Supply focuses on items for Black women, offering hair extensions and nail products. The store had been closed since late March because of the pandemic and had no income for about two months.
 The store was set to open June 1, but the night before, one of Park’s former employees texted her: There was talk in local Facebook circles, the person said, that looters were going to hit the beauty shop.
 Early that morning, Park got a call from her alarm company that the store had been vandalized. When her husband arrived at the store, police had already left. Inside, the display counters had been wrecked, and some of the most expensive hair extensions had been stolen, Park said. The Walmart had also been vandalized.
 The worst part was watching the security camera footage from that night. Park said she recognized some of the people who had broken into the store because they were among her customers.
 “There were some familiar faces,” she said. “It is too much stress thinking about it. I just try to focus on the kind people.”
 Park said she planned to donate more money for college scholarships for local students. But in two years, when their lease is up, she said, they will most likely move their business out of Peoria.
 “I feel very tired,” said Park, who has cancer.
 Davis, who runs the clothing store, also received a tip from friends monitoring Facebook that her business, Janet’s Just for You, was a target. The daughter of a Peoria police detective, and a leader in the Black community, Davis, 63, went on a local radio station to plead for the looting to stop.
 “They say they are about Black Lives Matter, but if you break into my business, you are taking a Black life,” said Davis, who opened her shop 28 years ago.
 Although her store was spared, she blames the mayhem on young people outside Peoria who “hyped up” local residents.

BERLIN - Councilman Zack Tyndall officially joined Berlin's mayoral race this week.
 With two months until the filing deadline, two of the four seats up for grabs in this fall's municipal election now feature contested races. Tyndall announced that he was running for mayor Tuesday, roughly a week after resident Bill Todd declared his intention to seek the position. Mayor Gee Williams, who has not yet announced whether he will seek reelection or not, has led the town for the past 12 years.
 "I've not been able to go to the supermarket or walk through town without people asking me to do this," Tyndall said. "I don't know what the distaste is for the current administration, but people seem to want a different direction. I think I bring that to the table."
 Tyndall, who was elected to fill the District 2 seat on the town council in 2016, is a lifelong Berlin resident. He said he spent a year before he ran for council watching how town government worked.
