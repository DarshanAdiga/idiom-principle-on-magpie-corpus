Schalke coach Andre Breitenreiter believes his team will need a flawless performance in order to take anything from their weekend clash with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.
 Breitenreiter's men are without a win for six matches in all competitions and welcome Bayern to the Veltins-Arena on Saturday on the back of a dispiriting 3-2 derby loss to local rivals Borussia Dortmund.
 Bayern have taken an astonishing 34 points from 36 on offer in the Bundesliga so far this season and Breitenreiter stated that any mistakes made by Pep Guardiola's side will have to be ruthlessly punished.
 "We want to play without any mistakes – you need to against Bayern," he said.
 "We will be giving the team a clear game plan. There will be chances for us in the match.
 "We have gone over a number of things that we want to implement on Saturday, but we're the underdogs.
 "There are games where Bayern make mistakes and are maybe a little sloppy. We want to take advantage of that."
 Breitenreiter, who was reported by local newspaper Der Westen to have branded the Tuesday training performance of his players not on international duty as "a circus", is set to welcome back captain Benedikt Howedes from a fractured hand.
 Germany defender Howedes scored in both Bundesliga matches against Bayern last season as Schalke emerged with a pair of 1-1 draws.
 "All of the international players have returned fully fit," he added. "Bene Howedes is back on board now too after his injury.
 "Leroy Sane, Max Meyer and Leon Goretzka put in great performances with Germany Under-21s and have really developed as players."

Borussia Dortmund secured their place in the Europa League last 32 with a comprehensive 4-0 win over Qabala at Signal Iduna Park.
 With Krasnodar defeating PAOK 2-1 in Group C's other fixture on Thursday, three points were enough to book Thomas Tuchel's side a spot in the knockout stages.
 Dortmund were relentless from the outset and took the lead through Marco Reus in the 28th minute, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also getting the better of the evidently nervous Qabala goalkeeper Dawid Pietrzkiewicz on the stroke of half-time.
 Reus was withdrawn during the interval, but Dortmund continued to threaten and Qabala striker Sergei Zenjov put through his own net midway through the second period.
 Henrikh Mkhitaryan - who hit the post earlier in the game - produced an emphatic finish to put Dortmund 4-0 up before rattling the upright again 15 minutes from time. Tuchel's men – unbeaten in eight European matches under the 42-year-old - can now focus on finishing on top of the pool.
 Dortmund controlled the early exchanges and Pietrzkiewicz almost gifted the home side a goal in the 11th minute, only for Mkhitaryan to let him off the hook by volleying over from his poor clearance.
 The Qabala keeper was more assured five minutes later when he stayed big to stop Aubameyang netting the opener following a sprint down the right, with Gonzalo Castro sending the follow-up wide.
 After almost fumbling a deflected Matthias Ginter strike into his own net, Pietrzkiewicz was finally beaten after 28 minutes when Reus fired a low shot past him from the edge of the box – making it 31 successive games in which Dortmund have scored.
 The hosts grew in confidence and a ferocious 20-yard drive from Aubameyang flew narrowly wide before a last-ditch block from Rafael stopped Reus – who pulled up with a groin issue after celebrating his goal - from scoring his second nine minutes prior to the interval.
 Pietrzkiewicz produced a great save to keep out Mkhitaryan in the final minute of the half, but moments later he let Aubameyang's stabbed effort from the left-hand side of the box slip past him as Tuchel's side doubled their advantage.
 Adnan Januzaj replaced Reus at the interval, but Dortmund remained dangerous, with Mkhitaryan steering Marcel Schmelzer's low cross onto the upright.
 Pietrzkiewicz went some way to redeeming himself midway through the second half when he thwarted Januzaj, but from the resultant corner Zenjov headed the ball into his own net.
 Mkhitaryan got in on the act 20 minutes from time, slamming home from 18 yards after being fed by Lukasz Piszczek.
 The Armenia international came close to adding a fifth, but his 74th-minute strike crashed off the post before rebounding off the Qabala keeper and going wide.

While serving on the board of Burke United Christian Ministries, he had the opportunity to see the ministry grow and branch out.
 “Years ago, it was brought to our attention by a group of nurses and doctors that there was a lack of food and medical services for certain populations in this community,” Hemstreet said. “The Good Samaritan Clinic started in a unit at the housing authority, and the soup kitchen began in a house on Green Street. They have both grown tremendously over the years through the foresight and leadership of many people in this community.”
 He has served in the soup kitchen at BUCM for many years with his church’s serving team from St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church.
 A longtime friend, Dr. Andy Lang, also got Hemstreet involved with ministry at the local prison.
 “I really did not want to, but Andy persisted, and then he passed away,” Hemstreet said. “A few weeks after Andy died, a box of was delivered to my house with a note from Andy’s wife saying, ‘Tell Don to take these to the prison.’ That was 30 years ago, and I have been involved in Bible studies at the prison ever since. God works in mysterious ways, and prison ministry has been one of the many blessings of my life.”
 Another blessing he acknowledges is his 55-year marriage to his wife, Joy, and their four children and seven grandchildren. Their two oldest children live in Florida, and their two younger daughters live in Morganton.
 The Distinguished Person of the Year award is Hemstreet’s second honor from the Rotary Club. He was named a Paul Harris Fellow by Rotary some years before, another recognition for his community service.
 “I am truly grateful and honored to be chosen the Person of the Year by the Rotary Club,” Hemstreet said. “I have many friends who are members, and I have always appreciated what Rotary does, locally and internationally. Three generations of Hemstreets look forward to the annual pancake breakfast.”
 Dalton Walters, president of the club, praised the nomination.
 “Dr. Hemstreet is truly an example of the kind of citizen we should all strive to be,” Walters said. “His continued service to Morganton and Burke County has impacted many lives over the years. He continues to be an inspiration to us all, and I am honored to recognize him as the 2019 Distinguished Person of the Year.”
 The celebration to honor Hemstreet will take place at a date to be announced after the threat of coronavirus passes. In addition to giving him an award, the club will donate $1,000 to his charity of choice.
 Hemstreet encouraged others to become more involved in community service.
 “Saint Augustine said, ‘Love receives because it gives, and the more it gives, the more it receives,’” he said. “I have found that to be absolutely true in my life, and am prayerfully thankful to be a small part of a loving, giving community, especially in these times.”

Borussia Dortmund bounced back from two consecutive defeats to claim a 4-1 win over Bundesliga strugglers Stuttgart, as Jurgen Kramny's tenure as caretaker manager started with a loss.
 Stuttgart dispensed with Alexander Zorniger following the 4-0 home defeat to fellow strugglers Augsburg last week, but Kramny saw his team make a bad start when Gonzalo Castro's first Bundesliga goal for BVB gave the hosts a third- minute lead.
 The former Bayer Leverkusen midfielder then played a key part in Dortmund's second, laying off the ball smartly to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who made no mistake with an expertly dinked-finish.
 Aubameyang saw a goal chalked-off as Dortmund began to run riot, though Stuttgart did get themselves back in contention courtesy of Daniel Didavi's fifth league goal of the season.
 Dortmund stamped their authority on proceedings after the restart, and following a disallowed Marco Reus effort, extended their advantage when Georg Niedermeier turned it into his own net, before Aubameyang added gloss to the victory with a 90th-minute strike.
 The win is Dortmund's 10th Bundesliga victory this term, while Stuttgart have now lost their last three league fixtures. Thomas Tuchel's men remain second, eight points behind leaders Bayern Munich.
 Dortmund wasted little time in going ahead, Castro nodding home after latching onto the rebound from Henrikh Mkhitaryan's shot.
 Tuchel had made five changes to the line-up that was beaten by Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday, with Mats Hummels the most notable absentee, but he was not missed as his replacement, Sven Bender, made a terrific last- ditch tackle to prevent Timo Werner getting in on goal.
 Castro was the architect of Dortmund's next goal, his clever flick teeing up Aubameyang, who netted his 24th goal of the season with an exquisite chip.
 Aubameyang had the ball in the back of the net again shortly after, but the goal was disallowed for offside.
 Despite Dortmund's domination, Stuttgart pulled one back just prior to the interval when, moments after Werner had an effort cleared off the line, Didavi tapped into an empty net after being set up by Filip Kostic.
 Dortmund should have re-established their two-goal lead shortly after the restart as Reus fired in a fantastic cross, but Aubameyang could not apply the finish.
 Reus thought he had netted himself soon after, but his strike was correctly ruled out for offside, before Castro again combined with Aubameyang – whose driven effort was well saved.
 Dortmund's pressure finally paid dividends with 25 minutes remaining, a combination of Niedermeier and Przemyslaw Tyton deflecting Reus' strike into the bottom left corner.
 And the result was put beyond all doubt late on as Aubameyang raced on to Adrian Ramos' pass before dispatching the ball superbly past Tyton as Dortmund eased back to winning ways.

Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time and still one of the most recognizable people in the world, almost 20 years after his final retirement from basketball. He's been the subject of bestselling books like _The Jordan Rules_ and _When Nothing Else Matters_ and his own _30 for 30_ documentary, _Jordan Rides the Bus_ , about his time playing baseball in 1994. But he's never been covered as comprehensively as he is in Jason Hehir's 10-part docuseries _The Last Dance_ , which premieres April 19 on ESPN. The limited series is as complete a portrait of Michael Jordan's extraordinary basketball career as fans will ever get. It's a _Citizen Kane_ -like biography of Jordan's relentless pursuit of greatness at all costs.
  _The Last Dance_ is framed around the Chicago Bulls' 1997-98 season. That season was the end of the dynasty, when the team completed its second championship three-peat knowing that it would be the last one, due to resentful general manager Jerry Krause driving Jordan, coach Phil Jackson, and second-best player Scottie Pippen out of Chicago, with Jordan mulling retirement. It was a tense, conflict-plagued season that nevertheless produced transcendent basketball, and Hehir was given a treasure trove of archival footage, as a camera crew received unprecedented access to document the behind-the-scenes action. _The Last Dance_ shows players at their most unguarded, with incredible fly-on-the-wall footage of practices, bus rides, and Jordan pitching quarters with members of the Bulls's security team and relentlessly busting the balls of just about everyone he knows.

“It is a special honor that transcends politics and personalities, and it is reserved for those individuals whose leadership and service extend far beyond the range of the average citizen, exemplifying the Rotary motto of ‘Service Above Self,’” club officials said.
 Hemstreet was born in Chicago, Illinois, raised in Florida, and graduated from the School of Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University, according to the press release.
 “My first paying job in junior high school was working for a veterinarian,” Hemstreet said. “That experience let me know that I wanted to pursue veterinary medicine for a career.”
 He was working at a veterinary practice in Concord, North Carolina, when he heard about Morganton.
 “I had always wanted to have my own veterinary practice, and the drug reps who came to Concord told me Morganton could use another veterinarian, so I decided to take a chance, and we came here,” Hemstreet said. “I started my own practice (the Morganton Animal Clinic) in 1972. The original clinic was in the Salem community in a converted garage. I did the large animal work from our Volkswagen camper, with the help of my wife and children. In those early days, we had many adventures, to say the least.”
 Hemstreet and his family lived next door to the clinic until his practice grew too large for the facility. He moved the clinic to the current building on N.C. 181 and took on a partner, Dr. Sam Pearson. The two practiced veterinary medicine together for years, and eventually welcomed a third partner, Dr. Wendy Callahan. When Pearson was diagnosed with serious pulmonary disease, he and Hemstreet sold their practice to Callahan. Hemstreet still works there part-time.
 “My favorite thing about veterinary medicine is being part of the relationship between humans and their animals,” Hemstreet said. “Over my years of practicing veterinary medicine, it has become more of an art and a spiritual experience. I have known some of these clients and their animals for decades. I now see their children’s children’s dogs and cats. It is richly rewarding.”
 In addition to his work at the clinic, Hemstreet has served on the Burke County Board of Education for three terms.
 “Our goal as a board was improving academics and adding a weighted grading system (in which advanced-placement class grades have more weight than other class grades), so that college admissions officers could readily tell who the top academic students were in our system,” Hemstreet said of his first term. “During that time, the school board added several new middle schools.”
 More recent school board accomplishments he is most proud of include the language immersion program, the contracting of Chartwells food service and the rebuilding of Mountain View Elementary School.
 “Currently, in this challenging time, I am most proud of how Burke County schools have led the way in continuing to feed students daily and providing (for) scholastic needs with online courses,” Hemstreet said. “We are one of the top systems in the state and serve as an example to surrounding counties.”
