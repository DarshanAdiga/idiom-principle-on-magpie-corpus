This sort of attitude is very typical of antivaxxers and is born of how much antivaxxers believe in alternative medicine and "natural" treatments. It's also, I've noticed, very typical of COVID-19 deniers, many of whose attitude seems to be, "Screw the old and chronically ill, I need to golf and get a haircut!" Indeed, this attitude started to take root fairly early in the pandemic, when a number of politicians of a certain political bent (you know which one) argued in essence that we need to sacrifice grandpa and grandma in order to save the economy. Fortunately, this is not an attitude shared by most Americans, although it is _de facto_ policy in too many parts of the country.

Face aux mesures de reconfinement prises à Lisbonne où est prévu en août le tournoi final de la Ligue des champions, l’UEFA a indiqué mardi qu’il n’y a «aucune raison de prévoir un plan B».
 «Nous espérons que tout ira bien et qu’il sera possible d’organiser le tournoi au Portugal. Pour le moment, il n’y a aucune raison de prévoir un plan B», a indiqué à l’AFP un porte-parole de l’UEFA, précisant que l’instance du football européen est «en contacts permanents avec la Fédération portugaise de football et les autorités locales».
 «Nous suivons la situation au quotidien et nous nous adapterons le moment venu si nécessaire», a-t-il encore indiqué, reprenant les mots prononcés le 17 juin par le président de l’UEFA, Aleksander Ceferin.
 A compter de mercredi, les habitants de 19 quartiers de la banlieue nord de Lisbonne où persistent des foyers de contagion au coronavirus seront de nouveau confinés à domicile, a annoncé le Premier ministre Antonio Costa.
 Dans ces sous-communes contigües mais réparties sur cinq municipalités, dont celle de Lisbonne même, les rassemblements seront limités à cinq personnes, contre 10 personnes dans l’ensemble de la région de la capitale et 20 dans le reste du Portugal.
 La finale de la Ligue des champions 2019-2020, compétition suspendue mi-mars à cause du coronavirus, doit avoir lieu dimanche 23 août à Lisbonne, à l’issue d’un tournoi final inédit réunissant huit équipes dans la capitale portugaise à partir du 12 août.
 Quatre équipes sont déjà qualifiées pour les quarts de finale de C1: le Paris SG, le RB Leipzig, l’Atalanta Bergame et l’Atlético Madrid.
 Les quatre autres tickets seront attribués après les huitièmes de finale retour restant à disputer et prévus les 7 et 8 août dans des lieux encore à déterminer, soit sur le terrain de l’équipe qui reçoit, soit au Portugal.
 La présence ou non de spectateurs dans ce tournoi sera «régulièrement évaluée» en fonction de la situation sanitaire, avait indiqué l’UEFA le 17 juin.
 Au Portugal, pays d’environ 10 millions d’habitants, où le masque est obligatoire dans les espaces fermés, le nombre de nouveaux cas quotidiens est remonté ces derniers jours à entre 300 et 400, alors qu’il était tombé à environ une centaine début mai.

Following the success of his first few singles, Nelson was featured on Spotify’s “Artists to Watch in 2016” list. His songs — those on the E.P and after — have been included in television shows and movies such as “Lucifer,” “The Royals,” “The Space Between Us,” “The Good Doctor,” “Love, Simon” and even “American Idol.”
 Nelson’s sound is kind of a hybrid between indie pop and alternative and can be compared to bands like Bastille, Coldplay, Imagine Dragons and artists like Ed Sheeran and Finneas O’Connell.
 I first discovered Banners after watching “The Space Between Us,” a movie about a teenager who grew up on Mars and falls in love with a girl from Earth. The movie in itself was the biggest pile of sappy mush I’d ever witnessed, but “Shine a Light” was anything but. The song starts with Nelson’s radiant falsetto and quickly gains momentum with rapid drum beats that sound like a quickening heartbeat. The chorus is all-encompassing and cinematic, the instrumentals swelling like a tidal wave, illustrating the line, “Cause I was lost at sea while the waves were dragging me underneath.”

Every year now, gardeners should be rethinking what they grow and where because of climate change, experts say. The growing season has become longer, delivering bigger harvests but requiring more weeding and controls. Plants are under stress because of rising temperatures, less frequent but more intense precipitation, and changed pest and disease problems. Flowers and the insects that pollinate them are falling out of sync. \"Conditions have become more challenging for gardeners since the weather has become more unpredictable,” says Richie Steffen, executive director and curator of the Elizabeth Miller Botanical Garden in Seattle. “We’ve had much hotter summers, while our winters have been all over the place,” he says. ”Some were dry. Some were very wet. And in this region at least, our wet spells tend to come with much heavier rains rather than our typical misty rains.” The average home gardener should examine water use, and estimate how much of that precious resource is going to be necessary and available in the future, he says. “Be less rigid about lawns and not so fastidious about keeping them watered all summer,” Steffen says. ”Create more habitat and extend the flowering season for pollinators. \"And be more selective about plant selection. Many things not so readily available 20 or 30 years ago are available now.” The most trustworthy plants are those that regenerate quickly and can handle extremes, says Jessi Bloom, owner of NW Bloom EcoLogical Services in Redmond, Washington. \"Another group of plants to consider is edibles, for personal resiliency and food security,” she says. The climate in 2025 will be different even from that in 2020, so take that into account when doing your landscape planning, says Sara Tangren, invasive species...

WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) — The Navajo Nation Department of Health is reporting 63 additional cases of coronavirus with no new deaths. The numbers made public late Monday put the number of positive COVID-19 cases on the reservation at 7,532. The death toll remains at 363. Reports from a dozen health care facilities on and near the Navajo Nation indicate more than 5,080 people have recovered. More than 54,700 people have been tested so far. The Navajo Nation stretches into northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah and was initially hit hard by the virus. Navajo President Jonathan Nez noted in a statement that Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey was reimposing certain restrictions due to the rise in new COVID-19 cases in that state. In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has paused plans for reopening more of the economy as state officials there cautiously monitor coronavirus case numbers. “Here on the Navajo Nation, we certainly don’t want another spike in cases, so we need to stay the course and keep fighting this modern-day monster together,” Nez said. “It’s a challenge for our Nation to keep flattening the curve when areas around us are seeing spikes in cases, but we are strong and resilient and we will overcome this pandemic eventually.” Nez planned to host an online town hall Tuesday to provide updates to the tribe. The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough for most people. But for some — especially older adults and people with existing health problems — it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Thousands of non-resident Telugus in the US and other countries are planning demonstrations on July 3 to express their solidarity with the farmers of Amaravati, the present capital city of Andhra Pradesh, as their agitation against the trifurcation of the state capital completes 200 days.More than 24,000 farmers of Amaravati capital region have been on the warpath ever since the YSR Congress Party government in the state, led by YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, announced on December 17 last year about creating three capitals - executive capital at Visakhapatnam, legislative capital at Amaravati and judicial capital at Kurnool.These farmers belonging to 29 villages - who gave away nearly 34,000 acres of their fertile land to the capital city during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime in 2015 - strongly resisted the move, asserting that they had sacrificed their livelihood in anticipation of the development of a world-class capital city in Amaravati."For the last 200 days, these farmers have been waging a relentless battle demanding that the capital be retained at Amaravati. They took out rallies, held relay hunger strikes, blocked the national highways and braved arrests and lathi attacks from the police. Some of the farmers died of heart attacks due to psychological pressure," prominent Telugu businessman Jayaram Komati told HT over the phone from California.Komati, who was former president of Telugu Association of North America (TANA) and former special representative of AP government for North America, said representatives of non-resident Telugu associations in the US had decided to stage demonstrations in as many as 200 cities, in support of the 200 days' agitation by Amaravati farmers to retain their capital city."We thought of taking up huge rallies, but because of Covid-19 pandemic, we won't be able to get permission for the same. So, we decided to restrict our protests by taking out candle-light rallies in these cities to convey our solidarity to the fighting farmers of Amaravati," Komati said.He said on coming to know about the proposal, Telugus in several other cities had also come forward to hold rallies. "Similarly, Andhra people in other countries like Singapore, Thailand, Australia, England and New Zealand have also evinced interest in similar demonstrations. In all, the protests are likely to take place in 300 cities," the NRI businessman said.He reminded that the NRIs were not against the Jagan government, but were only demanding that the capital city be retained in Amaravati. "We strongly feel that there should be decentralisation of development, but centralised administration," he said.The NRI Telugus had contributed to the building of the state capital. When former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched a campaign - My Brick, My Amaravati - aimed at selling "electronic bricks" to build Amaravati, they responded in huge numbers.The TANA collected donations from its community members in the US and Canada under 'My Brick, My Amaravati campaign' and presented the collected donations to the previous TDP government. More than 2.28 lakh NRI donors purchased nearly 58 lakh bricks sold online, each at a cost of Rs 10.Komati said the Andhra NRIs would continue to help the agitating farmers of Amaravati financially and morally to help them fight a legal battle against the decision to shift the capital. "We shall use all our resources and influences to see that the capital is retained at Amaravati," he said.

One of the happy delusions that many in the science-based community (including, at least somewhat, myself) and mainstream press have held over the years that has been punctured by the arrival of COVID-19 is that one main reason that antivaccine beliefs persist is that we've forgotten the toll that the diseases against which we vaccinate. If, for instance, measles returned with a vengeance, or haemophilus influenza type B, or polio, antivaxxers would see the error of their ways, and resistance to vaccination would diminish. How many times have you heard this argument? How many times have I suggested this? It's a comforting thought. However, truth be told, it is also one that makes us, as science advocates, feel a bit smug and confident. That's not to say that there isn't a grain of truth in this idea, particularly for the vaccine- hesitant, but for hard-core antivaxxers, it has been a comforting myth. But why is it a myth? It seems so obvious, so rational, to think that the return of deadly diseases would knock some sense into antivaxxers' heads. So why have antivaxxers aligned themselves with COVID-19 deniers and conspiracy theorists in the most emphatic way possible, with a number of COVID-19 lockdown protests being organized by antivaxxers? Let me provide some perspective as someone who's been following the antivaccine movement for nearly two decades and writing about it regularly for over 15 years. I will admit that these are my observations, and that there isn't a lot of research, but perhaps I can provide some ideas for actual research and action regarding public health.
