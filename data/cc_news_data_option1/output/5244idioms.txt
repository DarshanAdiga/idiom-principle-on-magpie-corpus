On plantations throughout the Colonies, during the 18th century, cocoa was making its way into the kitchens and onto the tables of the most wealthy families. The art of chocolate-making - roasting beans, grinding pods onto a stone over a small flame - was a labor-intensive task. An enslaved cook would have had to roast the cocoa beans on the open hearth, shell them by hand, grind the nibs on a heated chocolate stone, and then scrape the raw cocoa, add milk or water, cinnamon, nutmeg or vanilla, and serve it piping hot.

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A plan that designates where oil wells can be built within the Little Missouri National Grassland is frustrating conservationists, who say it allows wells near roads in certain pristine areas where new roads generally are not allowed to be built. The plan by the U.S. Forest Service was released earlier this month for the area, which includes a large swath of western North Dakota and includes much of the Badlands. The plan and an accompanying environmental impact statement apply to land where the federal government owns surface and mineral rights. While the plan offers protections for sage grouse, rare plants and bighorn sheep, the Bismarck Tribune reported that one provision of the environmental impact statement allows for oil well pads within a quarter-mile (402 meters) of existing roads in what are known as “inventoried roadless areas” where new roads generally cannot be built. “It obviously got me riled up, and it’s gotten a lot of people riled up,” said Dave Pieper, a former grasslands supervisor who retired in 2011 after a lengthy career in the Forest Service. Some of that land, he said, “is the best of what’s left, and there’s not much left.” Grasslands supervisor Bennie South said the plan recognizes the changes in oil and gas development in North Dakota. “It’s an attempt to try to balance being productive with the resources we have but sustaining those resources and grasslands for the American people so the people can come out and enjoy those lands,\" he said. Badlands Conservation Alliance members often camp, hunt and bird watch in the grassland. Alliance executive director Elizabeth Loos said members appreciate the remote natural beauty of the area, and being able to get away from oil and gas is important. Pieper...
