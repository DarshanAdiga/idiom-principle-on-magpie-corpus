Strontium is a chemical element that is found in bedrock, which is specific to a geographic location. As strontium erodes, its composition is absorbed into the soil and water and enters the food web. As animals drink the water and eat the plants, their teeth, and hair and bones, obtain a geographic signature reflecting where they have lived in the past and most recently, respectively.

El vencedor será el rival del Emirates Team New Zealand en la Final de la 36ª Copa del América del 6 al 21 de marzo de 2021.
 Salvo cambios inesperados, los cuatro equipos competirán con sus AC75 con 'foils' de última generación, el segundo de los dos barcos que han construido para la Copa. Así, en el agua estarán el 'Luna Rossa II' italiano, el 'Brittania II' británico, el 'Patriot' estadounidense y el 'Te Rehutai (Brisa Marina) neozelandés.
 Estarán en la línea de salida después de más de dos años de planificación, análisis de datos, construcción, pruebas y entrenamientos.
 El 'Britannia' del equipo INEOS es el Ac75 más extremo de los desafiantes. La característica más notable es su skeg (aleta central que precede al timón), robusto y agresivo recorre la línea central del casco, deteniéndose justo en frente del timón.
 Su tripulación presenta cambios con respecto al del equipo que compitió en la pasada edición de 2017 en Bermudas. Giles Scott está llamando a tácticas para el patrón Ben Ainslie, con Leigh MacMillan como controlador de vuelo y los veteranos de la Copa David Carr y Nick Hutton, el español Xabi Fernández y el remero olímpico Matt Gotrel.
 El 'Luna Rossa' es el AC75 más estilizado. Su diseñador el uruguayo-brasileño Horacio Carabelli ha opinado que han 'avanzado bastante bien'. 'Son solo pequeños detalles que realmente mejoramos de nuestro barco de primera generación '.
 Con dos navegantes de la talla del australiano Jimmy Spithill y el italiano Francesco de Angelis, será el único equipo con dos patrones de manera simultánea a bordo, bajo la supervisión de Max Sirena.
 El equipo estadounidense American Magic presenta al 'Patriot', que se parece mucho al 'Defiant' su primer AC75. Su skeg se prolonga 18 metros por debajo del casco para mantener el mayor tiempo posible su eficiencia aerodinámica como el ala de un avión, por algo Airbus es uno de sus socios.
 Su diseñador, el español Marcelino Botin explica al respecto que, 'su forma aerodinámica del casco trata de maximizar la fuerza motriz del aparejo y las velas y minimizar el momento de escora; es tan simple como eso'.
 Con el neozelandés Dean Barker como patrón, que regresa para competir en su casa junto a Terry Hutchinson, gran parte del equipo procede del Quantum Racing de Doug DeVos.
 El defensor del título, el Emirates Team New Zealand, tras el éxito logrado en la última edición en Bermudas y que ha marcado las reglas para la presente mantiene la vanguardia de diseño que ha mostrado durante dos ciclos consecutivos de Copa.
 Para los expertos, el 'Te Rehutai' (Brisa Marina), presenta áreas limpias y planas buscando la máxima estabilidad y gran aceleración para el vuelo.
 El jefe de diseño del equipo, Dan Bernasconi, ha reconocido que han estado 'buscando el equilibrio perfecto entre rendimiento hidrodinámico y aerodinámico'. 'Hemos optimizado las líneas para un vuelo estable. Estamos seguros de que será competitivo en todo el rango de velocidades del viento que podemos ver en la America's Cup'.
 La presencia en la tripulación de los campeones mundiales y olímpicos Pete Burling y Blair Tuke, ganadores de la última edición de la Copa es una garantía para los 'kiwis'. Burling será el patrón y Tuke el controlador de vuelo, contando con Glenn Ashby y Ray Davies, dos leyendas más a bordo.
 Esta Copa del América será muy diferente: los espectadores no pueden viajar a Nueva Zelanda y Joven Copa del América ha sido cancelada aunque se confía en la afición del país, ya que representa el 90 por ciento de la gente que acude a la competición. EFE

Around the world, climate change is becoming an epochal crisis, a nightmare of drought, desertification, flooding and unbearable heat, threatening to make vast regions less habitable and drive the greatest migration of refugees in history. But for a few nations, climate change will present an unparalleled opportunity, as the planet’s coldest regions become more temperate. There is plenty of reason to think that those places will also receive an extraordinary influx of people displaced from the hottest parts of the world as the climate warms. Human migration, historically, has been driven by the pursuit of prosperity even more so than it has by environmental strife. With climate change, prosperity and habitability — haven and economic opportunity — will soon become one and the same.

This service, Cameo, is more or less a service that offers personalized videos that are performed by a person's favorite celebrities and can run anywhere from $22.50, for William Hung who will sing "She Bangs" to well into the thousands, as Caitlyn Jenner appears to be charging the most, because as we all know the Jenner/Kardashian clan needs the money. Yes, that was entirely sarcastic, and so is saying that this is the greatest idea ever since the fact that people are paying for this, to hear a personalized video from a favorite actor, is about as around the bend as it gets. The fact that Brian Baumgartner, who people know best as Kevin from The Office, has made over $1 million in a year's time on this service is more evidence that people will pay good money for absolutely ANYTHING. To each their own and all that, but this is enough to confound a lot of people since it's essentially another way for stars to earn money apart from their acting careers, and perhaps the biggest annoyance is that the cost of it is insanely high when to be fair unless a percentage earned is going to a charity or some other worthy cause, people are fueling the lifestyle of the celebrities in yet another way while possibly trying to survive on their own as 2020 has been a seriously trying year when it comes to finances.

SMIC's stock buckled following the news. Shares slid nearly 5% in Hong Kong and 5.5% in Shanghai.
 SMIC has recently entered the US government's cross hairs as tensions between Washington and Beijing escalate and potentially threaten the firm's attempts to build cutting edge chip technology.
 Much of China's supply of chipsets comes from foreign companies, which power everything from Chinese smartphones and computers to telecommunications gear. Last year the country imported $306 billion worth of chips, or 15% of the value of the country's total imports, according to government statistics.
 Beijing has pledged to improve its chipmaking technology. SMIC, whose major shareholders are state-owned companies, said earlier this year that it wants to invest in technology and catch up with its global competitors.
 SMIC remains three to five years behind industry leaders Intel, Samsung and TSMC and analysts say that it has a long way to go to be a global competitor. Pressure from Washington threatens to make that goal even harder.
 Earlier this month, the US Department of Defense added SMIC to a list of companies the agency claims are owned or controlled by the Chinese military, a decision that means SMIC is subject to restrictions like an inability to accept American investment.
 SMIC has previously said that its inclusion on the list would have "no major impact" on its operations, and has also said that it has no relationship with the Chinese military.
 But any level of US scrutiny is concerning. Chinese tech company Huawei, for example, has been slapped with a number of sanctions that have effectively crippled its global business.
 Unlike Huawei, SMIC has not been added to a Commerce Department list that would essentially cut it off from US supplies and technologies. But the company has warned investors that potential US export restrictions are a concern.

But in the long term, agriculture presents perhaps the most significant illustration of how a warming world might erode America’s position. Right now the U.S. agricultural industry serves as a significant, if low-key, instrument of leverage in America’s own foreign affairs. The U.S. provides roughly a third of soy traded globally, nearly 40 percent of corn and 13 percent of wheat. By recent count, American staple crops are shipped to 174 countries, and democratic influence and power comes with them, all by design. And yet climate data analyzed for this project suggest that the U.S. farming industry is in danger. Crop yields from Texas north to Nebraska could fall by up to 90 percent by as soon as 2040 as the ideal growing region slips toward the Dakotas and the Canadian border. And unlike in Russia or Canada, that border hinders the U.S.’s ability to shift north along with the optimal conditions.

SAN DIEGO -- As financial factors collide like bumper cars at Coney Island and the Padres creep ever closer to the unrelenting Dodgers, they are experiencing a unique type of whiplash.
 The pandemic bruised the books. The contracts of Manny Machado, Erik Hosmer and Wil Myers will chew up $70 million if they play 162 games in 2021. Stakes soared with a historic trade-deadline push. Injuries to Mike Clevinger and Dinelson Lamet spiked the need for starting pitching. Urgency to lock down electric shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. lingers.
 This will be the ultimate test of the baseball operations department's Gumby- like flexibility and creativity, under unprecedented circumstances. How do you balance getting better now, with the Dodgers in sight along the horizon, while ensuring Tatis cements his mailing address? All of it must feel a little like trying to play Tchaikovsky on the piano while wearing oven mitts.
 "(Tatis') situation is a priority," Padres general manager A.J. Preller said Monday. "I think we're in position to try and line up on a deal. We'll see what happens here over the course of the rest of the offseason and see if we can do that."
 The dance remains delicate. Factors under your control, Sumo wrestling with so much that remains wildly out of your control. How many games will be played next season as baseball weighs waiting out vaccines to buffer safety and increase the chances of some fans returning to ballparks? Potential revenue in 2021 is all over the map.

 Mr Burnham told the BBC: “We have seen steady decreases across all of our boroughs pretty much ever since the last tiering decision to the point where we are now significantly below the England average across the 10 boroughs.
 “We’re below London and below Liverpool when they went into Tier 2 originally.”
 He added that this was across the region and some boroughs "are above the national average or close to it".
 Asked if his position has been backed by local NHS leaders, Mr Burnham said some health leaders in the region were "erring more on the side of caution".
 But he said his views are "backed by the evidence of what is taking place in the NHS".
 “We’ve seen reducing pressure on intensive care, and on general hospital beds in time," he said.

Retailers have taken note of the changing market dynamics.
 LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, pointed to "great strength of the demand coming from mainland China" in an October earnings call.
 "From a demand viewpoint, we have no particular worry, and we are very pleased with the response," said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony. "But for the time being, there are serious constraints as to [customers'] ability to shop outside China, and this is obviously a weight on the growth for coming quarters."
 The pandemic has also accelerated several long-term trends.
 Even before the outbreak, mainland Chinese shoppers were spending money closer to home as they avoided hubs such as Hong Kong due to mass protests, and as brands reduced the price gap that had typically made their products cheaper outside China.
 And as with other sectors, the crisis encouraged more people to shop online.
 The habit will likely stick. Nearly 40% of Chinese consumers plan to do more luxury shopping online over the next few years, while another 40% expected to maintain their current activity, according to Bain and Alibaba.
 "We believe Chinese luxury consumers' online shopping behavior has permanently changed," the firms wrote.
 Next year, China's growth is expected to continue, albeit not at the same pace. Most brands believe the market will expand by roughly 30% as international borders start to reopen, according to the report. Over the next five years, the share of domestic spending will likely also "subside" as things gradually return to normal, it said.
 But the Chinese market will have boomed in the meantime. In five years, China is expected to become the world's biggest luxury market — even after the world "returns to pre-Covid-19 levels," Bain consultants wrote.

The authors give an analyzed full-fledged account of the growing ambition of the EU to lead the global transition to a climate-neutral world. In their work, they also suggest that the transition will also impact the external relations of the EU, for example with Russia, and suggest that the two blocs can preserve their energy relationship in light of the energy transition, notably through the conversion of natural gas to hydrogen and storing the resulting CO2.

By virtue of his appearance, Stephen Hohlbaugh clinched the point title and settled in for the competition. The 2019 class champion, Brandon Yates, won the heat race. Billy Dukes took the early lead in the feature. Dukes lost the lead momentarily to Vernon Hart on lap four, but gained it back before the lap was complete. Dukes would not have it easy as Hart stayed within striking distance. Hart was able to slide by as Dukes exited the race with an apparent tire issue. Hart avenged a disappointing finish in his last run by claiming his second feature win of the season.

 # Wheatland-Chili soccer coach retiring after 39 years
 Messenger Post Media
 Monroe County Post
 After 550 wins, three state championships and nine Section V titles, coach Gary Ward is hanging up the clipboard for good.
 For the last 39 years, Ward coached the girls soccer team at Wheatland-Chili High School.
 When he first started coaching the varsity team in 1982, he was the second girls soccer coach at Wheatland-Chili. Six years had passed since Title IX ensured equal access to opportunities for female athletes, but legal access didn’t always translate immediately to tangible access.
 “The early kids were real pioneers and they took some risks,” Ward said. “We had to fight for field time, we had to fight for equal facilities and participation … They knew how lucky they were to be playing.”
 The 2020 team is as resilient as any team Ward has seen in his 39 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic kept people from gathering in groups, so the team had few opportunities to train, practice and bond as a team. Injuries took a toll and players were required to wear masks during practices and games.
 “Our kids have been great,” Ward said. They haven’t complained. We made it clear what the mask rule is and they didn’t bat an eye. I couldn’t say more about them.”
 When asked to pick the most memorable moment of his career, Ward struggled.
 “There were so many highlights and so many great kids,” he said. “I guess one of the most exciting moments would have to be the 2017 State Championship,” which the Wildcats won on a Golden Goal after double-overtime. He also pointed to the state championships in 1991 and 2016.
 Despite his record of success, Ward makes it clear that winning isn’t everything.
 “I never set out to worry about winning,” he said. “We try to teach them how to play and approach the game properly. What we say is ‘Go out and give it your best, play the way you’ve been taught and at the end of the day we’ll look at the scoreboard to see who won.’ We try to take the pressure off the kids … We want to teach them to compete in a healthy way.
 “To me, coaching is teaching … We’re trying to use [soccer] as a vehicle to help our kids grow and be good people.”
 Abby Jones, who played for Ward in 1988-91 and led the team to a state championship, said Ward was “always so positive, guiding everyone and bringing out the best in us. The lessons he taught on the field were so relevant in life … He improved your game, certainly, but he also improved your life.”
 “He was very compassionate and caring for his players, above and beyond coaching on the field,” said Jill Farrell, a former player and current kindergarten teacher at T.J. Connor Elementary School. “A lot of us had him as a teacher, too, and he wanted to make sure we were doing well in our studies. He was always really supportive.”
 After nearly four decades, Ward is stepping away from the sport that has come to define his career. He’s looking forward to spending time with his wife, JoAnn, and getting back to showing his horses. He plans to continue attending Wheatland-Chili soccer games as a spectator.
 “I hope I get a free pass,” he joked to athletic director Todd Grimes. “We’ve got some great young kids on the team that I think are going to be great players.”

"These results are highly encouraging in light of the extremely challenging population, even among PDAC patients, in this study cohort," said Manuel Hidalgo, MD, PhD, Chief of the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and a Senior Member of the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, and principal investigator of this study. "All patients were initially diagnosed at stage IV, and greater than 70% had liver metastases, key contributing factors to very poor prognoses. I believe the results from this study strongly support further development."

“Abbiamo chiesto e ottenuto, insieme ai sindacati, la riapertura di un tavolo di lavoro, senza escludere anche la modifica della norma approvata, che riporta i dipendenti da ruolo unico Regionale a Dipendenti dell’agenzia. Questo in sintesi è avvenuto nell’incontro svolto alla presenza di CISL, CGIL e UIL, il presidente Bardi, gli assessori Fanelli e Rosa e ad alcuni consiglieri di maggioranza, i quali hanno accettato la nostra mediazione e sono venuti incontro al tema di riaprire il tavolo come accettabile metodo e discutibile merito. Ora si riapra immediatamente la questione e si discuta di un piano industriale e di come accogliere i rilievi della Corte dei conti legati alla relazione tra efficacia ed efficienza della spesa. Ora si chiede di accelerare e convocare gli incontri per arrivare a rivedere, emendare eventualmente la norma, definire ed eventualmente decidere se modificare quanto ad oggi si è determinato. Gli assessori Rosa e Fanelli sono stati smentiti dai sindacati per la loro superficialità e presunzione con cui hanno gestito la situazione che, allo stato attuale, è un inaccettabile cambio che spiazza tutti dall’oggi al domani. Sono circa 80 le unità interessate a un cambiamento di status che li riporta indietro di 6 anni, senza certezze e senza garanzie di prospettive.” Lo dichiara il Consigliere Luca Braia, capogruppo Italia Viva. “Chiedo che il Governo Regionale si impegni a convocare un tavolo finalizzato a trovare una soluzione condivisa, senza precludere alla possibilità di rivedere la norma che, in seduta del 4/12/2020, è stata approvata a maggioranza con una PDL recante “Disposizioni di integrazione e manutenzione del sistema normativo regionale” e che, a partire dal primo gennaio 2021, tra meno di 20 giorni in pratica, vede il personale regionale con rapporto di lavoro a tempo indeterminato della Regione, funzionalmente attestato presso l’Alsia, trasferito alle dipendenze della stessa agenzia.

All four Forsyth County teams have advanced to the Elite Eight after both Forsyth Central and South Forsyth won their games Tuesday in the second round of the Class 6A-7A playoffs.
 Region champion Forsyth Central shut out Cherokee at home with a 12-0 victory. The Bulldogs’ defense has allowed only 18 points all season.
 “When we started at the beginning of the season, we knew we had a good team,” Central head coach James Mills said. “Being the first year where you’re playing out of the county, we weren’t sure how that would translate. But about three games in, we were saying ‘Oh man, we got something going on here.’”
 Lili Martin scored the only offensive touchdown for the Lady Bulldogs after a 67-yard rush by quarterback Katie Robbins. Central scored again with 6 minutes left in the game on a pick-six by Amelia Luke to seal the victory.
 South Forsyth won its second-round matchup at Sequoyah, 18-12, behind three touchdowns from the Area 5 Offensive Player of the Year Ashley Chu.

The final class of the night saw Gladiators with a good turnout in what be a lead-in to their final race next week. Bailey Purcell and Ricky Rutledge Sr. claimed their preliminaries and would start the feature in the second row. Patrick Tabb started off as the early lead, a quest to secure his fourth feature of the year. Tabb held on through the halfway mark, but Derrick Edwards would move into the top spot on lap 9. From there, Edwards had little trouble on the remaining laps, crossing the line in front of the field. The trouble came in the tech shed when Edwards, driving the car of another competitor, was found in violation, handing the win to Tabb.
