Barclays came under fire in the media earlier this year for its use of surveillance software that monitors and collects data on employees’ activities.
 The bank had installed software on its systems that monitored employees’ computer activity in real time, as well as the amount of time they spent logged in each day, with some staff reportedly receiving emails that they had not spent enough time working productively, or ‘in the zone’, as one Barclays manager described it, and should cut down on breaks.
 Following the resulting media furore, Barclays subsequently withdrew the software, explaining that its implementation was to raise general productivity and improve its processes.

McCarty said he also wants his bill to give neighboring police departments some role in initial investigations, so the officers who used lethal force aren’t solely investigated by the departments that employ them. But he doesn’t rule out involvement by the police agency whose officers used lethal force. One reason, he said: It would likely take days for a local agency to request the involvement of the Attorney General’s Office — leaving those crucial first hours of the investigation up in the air.

I have no idea what it feels like to be oppressed, and some may think I have no right to speak on this subject. However, speaking as a historian, it is difficult to find examples of where any type of reprisal or revenge has helped anyone. It is easier said than done, but the best way I can think of to help any situation of historic oppression is some type of forgiveness. If the oppressor can honestly repent and recognize its wrongs and the oppressed can offer historical forgiveness, maybe not only can we see peace in areas like Iraq, but here also.

“At the same time,” he added, “we didn’t want to spend any money, because we didn’t know how long this pandemic was going to go on for.”
 Jonathan Castro, the manager of a Barnes & Noble at a strip mall in Yonkers, New York, spent about two weeks in April and May taking books off the shelves and reorganizing the furniture. He was one of three people who came into the store every other day, alternating with another group of three.
 Some of the walls are painted blue now, and the signs look a little different. Many more of the books face out on shelves, so that customers can see the covers as they walk by. The books have been reorganized — for instance, nutrition titles and cookbooks are next to each other now, instead of on opposite ends of the store. And overall, the floor feels much more open. Many of the bulky displays have been thrown away — Daunt said every store got a dumpster — and replaced by smaller tables that are easier to browse and to walk around.
 “It’s a lot more open,” Castro said. “I can’t even explain how tight it was in here. You couldn’t really shop.”
 But much about the store remains the same. The brown leafy wallpaper is still there, as are the green and beige carpets. The bookshelves aren’t new, and have the chips and scuffs to prove it. There are still indents in the rugs that mark the old layout.
 Taken all together, it’s like seeing a friend for the first time in a while and wondering: What’s different? Did you get a haircut?
 Beyond tweaking the look of the place, what’s on the shelves is also a bit different. Debra Edwards, who runs the children’s books department at the Yonkers store, noticed while restocking during the lockdown that older titles — like “Strawberry Girl” (1945), by Lois Lenski, and “Rifles for Watie” (1957), by Harold Keith — were being sent in from the warehouses again. These books, both Newbery Medal winners, hadn’t been kept in stock in recent years, she said, but teachers and grandparents would come in looking for them. Adding them back is part of an effort to beef up the backlist in Barnes & Noble stores. They will have about the same number of total books on the shelves, but fewer of each title, offering a greater variety.
 “She came back,” Edwards said, pointing to Elizabeth Enright’s “Thimble Summer” (1938) on the shelf, near some other books that had recently returned. “We were excited because we get asked about them.”

Yes. Ultra-fast-fashion players like Boohoo and Fashion Nova have emerged from, and adapted to, fashion trends driven primarily by social media. They have few or no bricks-and-mortar stores. And they cater to the Instagram and TikTok generation that wants to buy today what their favorite celebrity or influencer wore yesterday and will post about their new purchases online.
 Fulfilling these shoppers’ relentless demands for new products as quickly as possible means working with factories close to home, which is why Fashion Nova sources a significant proportion of its collections from Los Angeles, and Boohoo from Leicester, England.
 More established fast-fashion retailers like Zara and H&M tend to source from developing markets and came under increasing public pressure to investigate, police and invest in the factories that make their products after the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013.
 But newer, ultra-fast-fashion retailers have encountered a little less scrutiny thanks to a younger customer base and keeping discussion of their business practices out of the limelight.

 "We knew this was going to be the case for a while and all I can say is that we are working beyond this season into next with what we think the plans could be," he added.
 "There aren't any announcements in terms of players coming or going, but what I do know is that we're on top of it.
 "It might not be straightforward, it might not be plain sailing. I don't think sometimes these things are but that's football, not just Swansea City."
 The chances of certain players remaining at the Liberty Stadium may depend on whether Swansea can achieve something remarkable in the next few weeks by returning to the Premier League.
 They have revived play-off hopes by claiming successive wins for the first time since December and, with four regular-season games remaining, Cooper says his team should relish the challenge of hosting the league leaders on Sunday.
 "There's everything to be excited about and nothing to be fearful of," he said.
 "I have seen some of the games at the bottom end of the league. That's when it's really tough and you can be playing with fear.
 "For us it should be about thriving, taking opportunities and being excited about what's in front of us. Let's have no regrets."

 Brown noted that families are welcome to have their own celebrations.
 8th grade recognition/NOTS cancelled
 Abilene Middle School Principal Jenna Delay said cancellation of the eighth grade recognition ceremony and Night of the Stars was an announcement she “did not want to have to make.”
 “I so wish we could gather to celebrate our AMS students’ achievements over the course of this highly unusually year, but unfortunately, that is just not going to be the case,” Delay wrote.
 Brown said the nature of both celebrations would have made it difficult to manage the various COVID-19 protection requirements.
 “Based on information from health professionals, it just wasn’t feasible at this time,” Brown said.
 In Delay’s email and Facebook post, she asked parents to help students understand “we do not have a choice in this matter and that, while extremely unfortunate, the health of our community is of the utmost importance.”
 She noted that the eighth graders and Night of the Stars attendees would receive a special package in the mail to celebrate their achievements.

 Abilene USD 435 officials will be sending out a survey this week to families.
 “We want to get a handle on their biggest concerns and build in some flexibility to meet those concerns to our best ability,” Brown said.

 “I think we need to commit ourselves to the use of masks at some level, but we’ll work through those details with Dr. Holmes and KSDE (Kansas State Department of Education),” Brown said.
 The district has orderwed equipment, including masks, specialized cleaning equipment and thermometers to “help manage the school day,” he said.
 More information regarding the new school year should be announced in upcoming weeks.
