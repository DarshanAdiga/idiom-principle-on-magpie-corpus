If you can't stretch to the carbon rail version of the Flite Boost, the entry-level option with manganese rails is £105 and weighs a respectable 243g. Selle Italia's other similar short saddle, the SP-01 Boost Kit Carbonio Superflow, gives you more performance, on paper, for less money, so if you want to save weight this might be a better option, if it fits your rear.

The Mariners made a handful of roster moves before Monday's opening game of their eight-game road trip. But they weren't moves that fans might have been hoping or expecting to happen.           A beat-up and inexperienced bullpen took a hit when veteran right-hander Carl Edwards Jr. was placed on the 10-day injured list with a forearm strain.           He had appeared in five games this season, allowing one run on two hits with six strikeouts and a walk in 4 2/3 innings pitched. He recorded a save Aug. 5 — the last time he pitched. He was working back-to-back games for the first time this season.           The Mariners recalled right-hander Bryan Shaw, a another veteran reliever, from the alternate training site to take Edwards' spot on the active roster.           Shaw, 32, was recently optioned to Tacoma after struggling in four appearances with the Mariners, pitching 3 1/3 innings and allowing 10 earned runs (27.00 ERA) on 10 hits with four walks and a hit batter. Of the 92 pitches he threw this season for Seattle, he had a total of five swings and misses.          Seattle signed Shaw just before opening day as a free agent after the Rockies released him with one year remaining on his three-year, $27 million contract. Colorado is paying for the prorated portion of Shaw’s $9 million salary ($3.3 million) along with a $2 million buyout for the 2021 season. The Mariners had to pay him only the prorated league minimum to put him on the roster.

New Delhi [India], Aug 10 (ANI): Indian Hockey team's Mandeep Singh has tested positive for coronavirus, said the Sports Authority of India (SAI) on Monday.       "Mandeep Singh, a member of the Indian Men's Hockey team, who was given the COVID test (RT PCR) along with 20 other players at the National Camp at SAI's National Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru, has tested COVID positive but is asymptomatic. He is being administered treatment by doctors, along with the other five players who have tested positive," SAI said in a statement.       Mandeep becomes the sixth player to have tested positive for the infection. Earlier on Friday, SAI said India hockey captain Manpreet Singh, Surender Kumar, Jaskaran Singh, Varun Kumar, and Krishan B Pathak have contracted the virus.        SAI on Saturday confirmed that all five hockey players who had tested positive for coronavirus are doing well and are being attended by their in-house doctor as well as one doctor from the state government.       The doctor from the state government has been deputed on the request of SAI.       "The five hockey players housed in NCOE Bengaluru, who tested COVID positive on August 7, are doing well. They are being attended to by SAI's in-house doctor as well as one doctor from the state government, who has been deputed on SAI's request," SAI had said in an official statement.       SAI has also got on board a few expert doctors from Manipal Hospital, who have also attended to the players.       "The vitals of the players like temperature, oxygen levels have been monitored and all five players have been found to be mild symptomatic cases. Except for one the other four players did not have a fever. They are doing fine and we have put them on immunity boosters and other support medicines," Dr. Avinash HR, who has been deputed by the state government and diagnosed the players today, had said in a statement released by SAI.

WASHINGTON) -- Deep in the woods on the outskirts of Accokeek, Maryland, lives Billy "Redwing" Tayac, 80, the chief of the Piscataway Indian Tribe.              His family, as he likes to say, is not from Maryland, Virginia or Washington D.C., they are from the Chesapeake Bay region.              Issues like calling their home by the native Indigenous terms, is just one of the several issues that Chief Tayac has fought for what he says has been his entire life.              Hailing from five generations of activists, if you live in the area, Chief Tayac may look familiar. Since the mid-1980s, Chief Tayac has been at the forefront of protests on getting Washingon's NFL team to change their name. On July 13, the team announced it was changing its name to the Washington Football Team during the 2020-2021 season.              "The name is racist that's what you've got to understand," said Chief Tayac. "Don't believe what I tell you, look it up in Webster's Dictionary for the Washington Football Team. I don't like to say the word, but it's Redskin. See what it means. It's a racial slur for Native Americans. It's derogatory."              For Chief Tayac, it's hard being a football fan, especially when his hometown team's name and mascot "hurts" him. He has no merchandise of the D.C. football team except one thing, a magnet on his refrigerator that reads "Love the team, hate the name," and that's exactly how Chief Tayac says he feels.              And growing up in the area, he says it was hard for him to celebrate victories like the Super Bowl or attending parades when all you see is the term written on hats, jackets and other accessories.              "Like I said, I led the demonstrations in the 80s and I was one of the original plaintiffs for this name here and it hurts," Chief Tayac said. "It's a racist term. Let's bury all these racist terms once and for all. We are all God's children, let's treat everybody as equal."              And although Chief Tayac may not be protesting in the field as he would in his younger days, the next generation of activists like Mary Phillips from the Laguna Pueblo/Omaha Tribe has carried the torch and continues to fight for the name change. Phillips refers to the name as the "R" word and wishes that no one says it or uses it even if it said regarding the football team.              "Because it's a word that conjures up so many horrible thoughts," said Phillips. "And it is a slur towards Native Americans for those who still haven't heard that but it's a slur."              Phillips adds it is very difficult to educate fans or people who celebrate Washington football because oftentimes fans do not understand or know the history of the word.              "And so it's always been, you know [difficult], trying to educate people to understand that this word, this team celebrates actually celebrates the color of my skin by saying that it is red," Phillips said.              "And therefore we can call you this name from history that proves that you are worth $200," Phillips said. "Your head, your scalp is worth $200 and people would hunt you down for that. And fast forward to today, why is that term even being used at all?"              Regarding the D.C. football team, some slight progress has been made, some say. The statue of former team owner George Marshall, who opposed desegregation and whose team was the last to integrate Black players, has been removed and the team has decided to refer to the team as the Washington Football Team for now. A battle that longtime owner Daniel Snyder has fought for years. Snyder wanted to keep the team's original name despite how some fans and indigenous locals like Chief Billy, felt. According to Chief Billy, it was not about "political pressure" or how people felt, for Snyder, it was about losing advertisements. Companies like Nike, FedEx, and Pepsi Cola threatened to pull advertising, and Snyder and the team dropped the nickname days later.              "With Mr. Snyder, what put the pressure on him to change the name? Money talks and that's what he realizes. And he realizes that he's fighting a losing battle. And that's the bottom line," said Chief Tayac.              In July, the team released a statement regarding its decision to stop the use of the name and logo until a new name is selected.              "On July 3rd, we announced the commencement of a thorough review of the team's name. That review has begun in earnest. As part of this process, we want to keep our sponsors, fans and community apprised of our thinking as we go forward," the team said in a statement last month. "… we are announcing we will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review."              But for Phillips, she says there is still much change that needs to happen in order to truly put an end to the term.              "It's not debatable," said Phillips. "And so it should never have been used as a casual word, much less for a team name and then celebrated and then plastered everywhere on this building, on the FedEx building, on every aisle you go down in a grocery store, you see the face, the logo, the word."              "In the grander sense of things, it's so evaporating from people's minds that they don't even realize how racist it really is," she said.              Chief Tayac said he wants people to know that even after the name change, the fight is not over. For Native Americans, their fight will always continue, he says.              "We didn't die in 1890 as a race of people. We're still here. That's God's will. Whether anybody likes it or not, I'd like to say this is our country. This is where God put us there. And nobody is gonna shove off of it," said Chief Tayac.              "We survived the genocidal practices of the United States government, the cultural genocide practice of people. And you know what, we're still here? That's what I can say. And I'm proud to be an Indian."

“People have learned from the history to say we’re not going to burn our community,” said state Assemblyman Mike Gipson, who was born in Watts a year after the turmoil. “We realize our community is not going to be built again.”                                                                                                                                       Watts has changed from an exclusively Black neighborhood in the 1960s to one that’s majority Latino. It remains poor, with high unemployment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The uprising started Aug. 11, 1965, in a nearby neighborhood after the drunken driving arrest of a young Black man by a white California Highway Patrol officer. The violence reflected pent-up anger over an abusive police force, a problem that has ebbed but not entirely faded, according to those who live here.                                                                                                                                       Improvements over the years include a more diverse Los Angeles Police Department that better reflects the city's population. One of Watts' major public housing developments, Jordan Downs, is being rebuilt with a nearby retail shopping complex.

HAMPTON COUNTY, S.C. (WTOC) - Hampton County’s two school districts are preparing for the new school year.Both districts start on September 8 and offer a hybrid schedule or a virtual schedule. Hampton County District One will have all students virtual on Monday and use a hybrid schedule for the rest of the week. Hampton County District Two will have all students virtual on Friday and use a hybrid schedule for the rest of the week. Times and length of the school day change depending on the students age.Parents are allowed to choose to they want all virtual or a hybrid situation. The parents we spoke with say they want their kids to get that socialization.“I want to try to do the hybrid. A little bit of classroom, a little bit of virtual. But that’s because she needs that social interaction,” said guardian Stephanie Mole.“After a long, long thought process I decided to do the blended learning for now. Just to kind of give the kids a taste of school,” said Emily Bowen, mother.One mother of three says her family wanted to take the opportunity while they could.“With the rate that everything is going now, they could shut it down soon anyway. And then the preparation. It’s just, it’s a lot.”But one student we spoke to was able to make the decision for himself.“Virtual,” said Hennessy.The senior says virtual learning is the best option in his opinion.“At the end of the day, we all going to be learning the same thing. Rather we in school or rather we not in school. So at the end of the day, I’d rather choose virtual over going back to regular school because you might never know what might happen,” said Hennessy.He worried if he went back other students or staff could expose him to the virus.“But for instance, if I stay home, I’ll be clear from the virus.”To him, this was the best decision he could make so he could graduate and fulfill his dream of joining the Coast Guard as safely as possible.Copyright 2020 WTOC.

MIAMI (AP) -- On land and sea, the travel industry is hurting but holding out hope for a recovery. Marriott says it has reopened most of its hotels around the world, helped by a rebound in business travel in China. The average occupancy at its hotels is also improving, although still at depressed levels. The hotel giant's CEO voiced optimism that the worst damage from the pandemic is over. The damage in the second quarter was clear: Marriott lost $234 million, as revenue its plunged 72%. In another corner of the travel industry, Royal Caribbean posted a $1.64 billion loss as cruise ships remained anchored in port.

DÜSSELDORF, Germany (AP) — Romelu Lukaku scored one goal and set up another as Inter Milan defeated a tenacious Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 to reach the Europa League semifinals on Monday.          Lukaku was the driving force from the start, imposing himself on the game and disrupting the Leverkusen defense to keep Inter in the hunt for its first trophy in nine years. Inter last played a European semifinal on its way to the Champions League title in 2010.          “We are growing but we have to learn to kill games off when we have the chances to do it, and we didn’t tonight," Lukaku said. “Now we have time to recover physically and prepare for another great game.”          When Nicolo Barella gave Inter the lead in the 15th minute it was off a rebound from a shot of Lukaku's which had been blocked. Six minutes later, Lukaku scored after a link up with Ashley Young, even though he was falling as he hit the shot while battling a defender.          Just as Inter threatened to overwhelm Leverkusen, the German team kept itself in the game. Kai Havertz played a one-two with Kevin Volland and fired the ball past goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to cut the gap to a single goal four minutes after Lukaku scored.          A video review stopped Inter extending its lead, overturning a penalty given for handball against Leverkusen left back Daley Sinkgraven. Leverkusen pushed hard to level in the second half but that opened up chances for Inter and Leverkusen goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky was called on to make repeated saves.

His decision came four days after he threw 85 pitches in his second simulated game and a day before he was scheduled to throw another simulated game.           On Sunday, manager Luis Rojas expressed hope it would be the last simulated game for Stroman, who was injured during the Mets’ summer workouts. New York’s next road trip is to begin Friday at Philadelphia and conclude with a four-game set at Miami Aug. 17-20.          Rojas said he understood Stroman’s decision but was surprised.          “He wanted to do another one just to play it safe and see how he felt coming out of it and then come join us,” Rojas said Monday. “But, once again, we fully support him.”          Stroman will go on the restricted list, allowing the Mets to clear a spot on the 40-man roster.          He will now head into free agency — he reached the six years of service time while on the injured list — without throwing a pitch this season. At 29, he’s expected to be one of the most sought-after starters on the open market.           He was due to make $4.4 million — the prorated portion of the one-year, $12 million deal he signed in January — and will give up the remaining total, a little more than $3.25 million, unless he has a precondition.

It's a decision she's continued to make during her 70-year career.Hannah Gaber with Cameron Fisher/USA TODAY
          She had a decision to make, one she would continue to make throughout her career.          "Do you have a choice to be courageous? I guess you do. The choices are very narrow. You can either sink or swim, and I obviously chose to swim."          In Puerto Rico, her grandfather would put on records and she would bop all over the living room. She was with her mom in the New York apartment of a friend, who was a dancer, and she began dancing around the tiny apartment. The friend asked if she could take Moreno to her dance teacher.           "And that's where it all began."          "It" is one of the most celebrated and honored careers in arts and entertainment. Moreno is best known for playing Anita in "West Side Story," a role that won her an Oscar, making her the first Latina to win the award. She went on to add an Emmy, Grammy and Tony.

On January 1, 2012, the federal government announced the removal of the fuel subsidy, sending the whole of Nigeria into a panic. Following this, the Nigerians suffered the domino effect of the spike in fuel prices. Transportation prices doubled. The cost of food, rent, electricity all increased. For a country where nearly all of its citizens live on less than $2 a day, life became unbearable.          And then something happened.          From this desperation and frustration rose the ‘Occupy Nigeria’ movement and with it, a new era of holding government accountable.          The protests held all over the country with protesters shutting down fuel stations and forming human barricades on roads. The movement also showed up significantly on social media with online blogs, Facebook, Twitter and BlackBerry Messenger playing a significant role in the organization and increased awareness of the movement.          It was beyond fuel subsidy. It was the awakening of long-oppressed Nigerians. An outrage against corruption. A cry for better governance. A call for accountability.          Perhaps, this public call for change did not start with the Occupy Nigeria movement. Perhaps we were always on a path leading to this point. But we cannot deny the fact that the movement was a huge turning point for Nigerians. The conversations on issues of corruption and governance that the movement sparked just could not be silenced.          Since then, there have been numerous occasions of Nigerians standing together against poor governance. We cannot forget the 2014 protest over the government’s failure to rescue the school girls kidnapped by the Boko Haram in the town of Chibok or the 2017 anti-government protest in Abuja or the 2018 protest by the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) for the release of their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzazy. There are also the more recent protests such as those by the ‘Revolution Now’ group led by Omoyele Sowore.          Through all of these, the reaction of the government has been the same - criminalization of the protests often culminating in unlawful arrests and/or violence and even killings of protesters.          This goes against our rights as Nigerians. According to our laws, each person is entitled to their opinions and has a right to assemble freely to protect their interests. In other words, peaceful protest is legal. In fact, according to Muhammad JCA in a 2007 case, the conduction of peaceful processions, rallies or demonstrations is a right guaranteed by the 1999 constitution.

Saitec company has installed in open waters, specifically in the Abra del Sardinero due to its protected conditions of waves, a floating wind platform that it has developed on a reduced scale, which is a milestone as it is the first prototype of this company installed in the sea in mainland Spain (there are two others in the Canary Islands) that will be used to generate renewable energy through an offshore wind buoy.              "Suffice it to say that only one wind turbine produces wind energy for 15,000 homes, that is, it is a commitment to the future that will undoubtedly have a very important market and that is the result of the work of people from Cantabria and the Basque Country", has assured the president of the region, Miguel Ángel Revilla.              And he pointed out that the world is going "irreversibly" towards the path of renewable energies, which is why he claims to "feel proud" that there are people in the region who are working on this evolution because we have to bet on energy production to replace coal, oil or gas and "in Cantabria there is a future."              In addition, he recalled that there is an Iberdrola project to install the "largest wind farm in the Cantabrian Sea" in the Escudo area, as well as Repsol's project to increase hydroelectric production by 1,000 more megawatts in Aguayo.              For his part, the Minister of Innovation and Industry, Francisco Martín, stressed that the project is in the prototype phases, phases of "higher risk" where companies have to take risks and invest and has ensured that, in this case, this It happens in Cantabria thanks to the Hydraulic Institute, Sodercán and because 10 Cantabrian companies have been able to collaborate and develop technologies that "did not exist before."              "This obviously has a very important addition, we are talking about more than 2 million euros invested, co-financed by the European Union, which would surely have gone to other places if Cantabria had not shown that it has that vocation of specialization", added Martín in statements to the media after the launch of the experimental buoy.              The platform, whose patent was born in 2012 and which has been in development for eight years, will be at the Abra del Sardinero for a year, although that time will also depend on future steps and possible future reuse of the platform but "the idea is to test it here Due to the conditions, although it is a real environment, it is a somewhat scaled environment that will allow us to test a platform and all its behavior 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ”said Saitec's technical director, David Carrascosa.              And he has assured that it is a "milestone" because it is the ninth technology installed in the world, the third based on the concrete structure and has indicated that they are "very happy" to be able to celebrate this day since it has been delayed quite a bit by the The coronavirus health crisis, because three days before the confinement they had the structure floating so they have been able to do a "good tightness test."              Carrascosa explained that the technical development began at the hands of the Institute of Hydraulics (IH) of Cantabria, later they collaborated with several companies in Cantabria in a project financed by Sodercán and did tests again at the IH and now, with the installation of this platform, is the "final" step of tank tests, laboratory tests, to go to real conditions.              It is a project that has a Cantabrian presence since up to 10 companies in Cantabria are collaborating in this project, so that 70% of the financing of this project will cover contracts in the region, one of the points that want to demonstrate that this type of energies since it implies a "very high" local content and they are "very interesting" when it comes to generating employment.

State and local government officials across the U.S. have been on edge for months about how to keep basic services running while covering rising costs related to the coronavirus outbreak as tax revenue plummeted.

“Versatility is going to be absolutely huge,” McGlinchey said. “It’s going to make or break guys having jobs and make or break situations to fill our roster because we can get in any situation at any point this year that we’re not just looking out for injury. We’re looking out for something that we can’t really defend ourselves from at times. To be able to have the ability to plug and play guys in different positions at different times is really going to allow us to keep moving as smoothly as operationally possible.”

LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) — Devin Booker scored 35 points, and the Phoenix Suns rolled past the short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder 128-101 on Monday to improve to 6-0 in the restart and improve their playoff chances.          The Suns have surged in the Western Conference standings. They entered the day just 1 1/2 games behind eighth-place Memphis and a game behind ninth-place Portland in the race to qualify for a spot in the play-in series.          “We haven’t accomplished anything," Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. “That may sound like coach-speak, but we dug ourselves a hole with our record. We scrapped all year long and won some games, but it’s been an uphill battle.”          Williams appreciates the position the Suns are in.          “We’ve done a good job of getting to this point,” he said. "No one knew we were going to be here, but we’re here and we’re thankful for that.”          Phoenix center Deandre Ayton sat out the first quarter because he missed his coronavirus test on Sunday. He tested negative on Monday and was cleared. He started the second quarter.           “In an NBA season guys are going to make mistakes," Williams said. "You have to be able to give people grace. It wasn’t intentional. Thankfully he was able to get tested early enough that he was able to come back and play, and the guys received him with open arms because we all understand we’re human.”

There are three gun types that players will encounter in-game: Power Weapons, Tech Weapons, and Smart Weapons. According to Senior Gameplay Designer Paweł Kapała, Power Weapons are most like contemporary guns. The key difference is that Power Weapons can ricochet bullets. Electromagnetic power fuels Tech Weapons, which propel a “fully metal projectile to extreme velocities.” Apparently, the metal projectiles are so powerful that they can pierce through cover and still do devastating damage to enemies in hiding. Smart Weapons take advantage of “guided missile technology” capable of tracking and honing in on multiple foes at once. Each weapon will boast attachment and modification options, such as scopes, silencers, damage output adjustments, etc.          The video also showcases a brief look at other weapon types, namely the melee weapons and Cyberware. One brief segment in particular shows the Thermal Katana melee weapon in action. Meanwhile, the Mantis Blades Cyberware gets a bit of the spotlight later in the trailer. These aspects of V’s arsenal don’t receive as much detail as the guns, but perhaps we’ll learn more at another time. There is, after all, another Night City Wire on the cards, though CDPR has yet to unveil a specific streaming date and time.           _Cyberpunk 2077_ launches later this year on November 19th for the PlayStation 4, PC, and Xbox One platforms. CD Projekt RED has previously confirmed that customers who purchase a current-gen copy will receive access to a next-gen upgrade free of charge.
