PROVIDENCE, R.I. - The governors of Oregon and New Mexico ordered near- lockdowns Friday in the most aggressive response yet to the latest wave of coronavirus infections shattering records across the U.S., even as many of their counterparts in other states show little appetite for reimposing the hard-line restrictions of last spring.
 “We are in a life-or-death situation, and if we don’t act right now, we cannot preserve the lives, we can’t keep saving lives, and we will absolutely crush our current health care system and infrastructure,” Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico said in imposing a two-week stay-at-home order.
 Oregon Gov. Kate Brown ordered a two-week “freeze” starting Wednesday, under which all businesses will be required to close their offices to the public and mandate work-from-home “to the greatest extent possible.”
 While most Oregon stores will remain open, gyms, museums, pools, movie theatres and zoos will be forced to close, and restaurants and bars will be limited to takeout. Social gatherings will be restricted to six people.
 The Democratic governor warned that violators could face fines or arrest.
 “For the last eight months, I have been asking Oregonians to follow to the letter and the spirit of the law, and we have not chosen to engage law enforcement,” Brown said. “At this point in time, unfortunately, we have no other option.”
 Both states had lockdowns earlier in the year, but the coronavirus is coming back with a vengeance across the country, and the U.S. is facing a long, dark winter. The scourge is blamed for 10.7 million confirmed infections and almost a quarter-million deaths in the U.S., with the closely watched University of Washington model projecting nearly 439,000 dead by March 1.
 Deaths have climbed to about 1,000 a day on average. New cases per day are soaring, reaching another all-time high on Thursday of more than 153,000. Hospitals are getting swamped.
 Still, there is little will among many governors and other elected officials for going back to the kind of lockdowns and large-scale business closings seen last spring. Some governors also continue to resist issuing statewide mask rules.
 Among the reasons given: public fatigue, fear of doing more damage to already- crippled businesses, lack of support from Washington, and the way efforts to tame the virus have become fiercely politicized.
 “I think that governors and mayors are, again, in a really tough spot. The American population is emotionally and economically exhausted," Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
 President Donald Trump asked all Americans to remain “vigilant” but ruled out a nationwide “lockdown.”
 “Hopefully, whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell, but I can tell you this administration will not go to a lockdown,” Trump said in his first public remarks since his defeat by President-elect Joe Biden.
 Governors in many states, such as New York, Maryland, Virginia and Minnesota, have taken largely incremental measures over the past few days, such as limiting the size of gatherings, making businesses close early, restricting capacity or cutting off alcohol sales earlier in the evening.
 Nevada Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak has repeatedly argued that containing the virus is largely up to individuals.
 “Some people are going to ask, ‘Why not limit retail, or casino resorts, or restaurants right now?’ That’s a fair question,” he said. “That is the tightrope of trying to balance controlling the COVID-19 spread, protecting our hospitals from surges, and at the same time, not destroying and shutting down our economy.”
 In Texas, which this week became the first state to surpass 1 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has emphasized new treatments and vaccines that are expected to become available soon.

Johnson quickly became the first player this week to reach 10 under with three birdies around Amen Corner. But then he had some mud on his ball — that's not unusual this week — that sent his ball to an impossible shelf on the 14th green, leading to a three-putt bogey.

Another Masters rookie, Sungjae Im (70), was in the group another shot behind that included Patrick Cantlay (66), who contended for the green jacket last year. Cantlay was among four players who had 66, the lowest score when play was stopped for the night.
 Among those still on the course was Tiger Woods, stuck in neutral on a day when the greens picked up a little more speed and the autumn leaves shook slightly with some wind. Bryson DeChambeau was struggling to make the cut after a lost ball that led to a triple bogey.
 What two days have shown is that Masters experience only goes so far on a soft course with rye grass that isn't grown in quite the way it usually is in April.
 Thomas served up one example from Friday morning. He was well left of the 15th green in two with the pin to the right, leaving a pitch that typically is nearly impossible to hit close. He went with a hard, low pitch that hit the brakes at the hole and spun gently to tap-in range for birdie.
 "I had to trust that I just had to gas it and hit it pretty hard and it was going to spin," Thomas said. "Balls are making pitch marks with chip shots and pitch shots."
 Woods left the course Thursday with only three players ahead of him. He was tied for 10th when the first round ended, and he was tied for 22nd when he left Friday night with two birdies on the par 5s and bogeys on the third and seventh, the latter from a tee shot close enough to the Georgia pines that his only shot was to hit a runner into the front bunker.
 DeChambeau, the betting favorite coming into the week because of his enormous bulk and power off the tee, took a big swing on No. 3 and never found the ball. With the altitude on his shots, it could have buried under the soft turf. Either way, he went back to the tee and drove in about the same spot, made a mess of his flop shot and took a triple bogey.
 He followed with two more bogeys but was in good position for a birdie to get back to even par for the tournament.
 The cut is top 50 and ties, and among those who will be sticking around are young and old — 23-year-old U.S. Amateur runner-up John Augenstein and 63-year-old Bernhard Langer. The two-time Masters champion shot 68 in the morning on a long, soft course. He followed with a 73 and will be the oldest player to make the cut at Augusta National.
 "It actually makes me feel older when I play with these young guys and I see how far they hit it and how short I hit it," Langer said. "I like this golf course. I think I know how to get around it, even though I hit very long clubs. But it's certainly not easy."
 It was plenty hard for Rory McIlroy, who opened with a 75 and was in danger of the weekend off until he rallied with a 66 to at least get back in the mix in his pursuit of the final leg of the career Grand Slam.

The letter was co-signed by 16 assistant US attorneys from 15 out of the 44 jurisdictions that were chosen by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to monitor the November 3 general election. The assistant US attorneys said in the letter that, in the districts they monitored, they found no evidence of substantial voting irregularities.
 The federal prosecutors in the letter covered jurisdictions in the Eastern and South Districts of New York, Eastern Kentucky, Kansas, Maryland, New Mexico, Northern California, Southern Ohio, Southern Iowa, Western Pennsylvania, Western North Carolina, Western Arkansas, the Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands, plus two prosecutors from Oregon.
 "In the jurisdictions where we serve as DEOs, in the 2020 election cycle, there is no evidence of 'substantial allegations of voting and vote tabulation irregularities' that 'could potentially impact the outcome of a federal election,' to use the language from the Memorandum," according to the letter.
 Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, declined to comment on the prosecutors' letter.
 Instead, Kupec referred to the last paragraph of Barr's memo, which includes: "Nothing here should be taken as any indication that the Department has concluded that voting irregularities have impacted the outcome of any election. Rather, I provide this authority and guidance to emphasize the need to timely and appropriately address allegations of voting irregularities so that all of the American people, regardless of their preferred candidate or party, can have full confidence in the results of our elections."

More important, taxation - in case you didn't know - entails taking people's money. I think putting to vote the question of how much the government is going to take is fair game. Special interests who want higher or lower tax burdens often do not like direct democracy. It is much easier to influence a small majority of lawmakers than it is to make your case to the public. Most lawmakers I know really don't like the people deciding things. A state senator once said to me that voters were "not smart enough to decide whether their taxes should be raised."  That mindset is precisely why direct democracy is a good thing. People are smart. They understand that they will have to live with their choices. But it is their choices they will be living with. That is good.

While many fans might be expecting them to continue their character's storylines, the reunion will instead be a retrospective special that will allow the cast to look back at the show's biggest moments.
 Fans have long been awaiting the special reunion episode, which was originally set to bring the cast together to celebrate the show's big move from Netflix to HBO Max. The episode was originally going to be released when the new streaming service was launched back in May 2020. However, due to COVID-19, they had to reschedule the episode's filming several times to make sure it was safe enough to record.
 This still hasn't stopped the cast from hanging out and being together in the middle of the pandemic. Co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, and Lisa Kudrow got together for a special sketch during the 2020 Primetime Emmy Awards back in September where they pretended to be living together for the time being.
 Along with the original cast getting together, a special host will also be joining in on the fun. There's no word if there will still be an audience for the special taping.

"Unnamed sources attacking a family's decision about what is best for their kids in the middle of a pandemic is shameful," White House spokeswoman Carolina Hurley said in response to CNN's request for comment.
 None of the sources CNN spoke to for this story used language that could be described as an "attack." The longtime parent at the school reiterated several times that the concern was led by the school's leadership and that attempts were made to resolve the issue and keep the family at the school.
 "As is true for all families, schooling choices and education are deeply personal decisions and they owe no one, especially idle gossips seeking press attention, an explanation," says Hurley.
 After Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's nomination ceremony at the White House Rose Garden in late September, which Ivanka Trump and Kushner did not attend, at least 12 attendees fell ill with Covid-19, many of them senior administration staff with regular interaction with the couple. At the school attended by their children, many parents took note of the superspreader event and called the head of school to express concern, said another source with knowledge of the events.
 The chief worry was Trump and Kushner worked in and among an environment where cases of the highly contagious virus were rampant, and where wearing face coverings and maintaining social distance were not regulated.
 Parents also complained that three days after the Barrett event, Trump attended her father's first presidential debate with now President-elect Joe Biden and, along with the rest of the adult Trump family members, did not wear a mask. The youngest Kushner child was at that time attending school in person, and the two older children were learning in person once a week, the same source with knowledge of the events said.
 The head of the school and other administrators attempted to remedy the situation with Kushner and Trump by reminding them of the handbook guidelines, said the longtime parent. The school's nurse sent a note to families reiterating the agreed-upon policy that any parent or child who may have been exposed to coronavirus must be tested and enter a voluntary quarantine for 14 days, out of an abundance of caution.
 Trump and Kushner did not quarantine for two weeks after the Barrett event, nor did they do so post-debate, and they did not quarantine following the positive Covid diagnoses of the President and first lady Melania Trump in early October. By October 11, Ivanka Trump was back on the campaign trail, that week visiting Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin.
 Behind the scenes, in addition to the nurse's note, the school "tried to work something out with the family to negotiate terms that would keep the children at the school, but also ensure the protocols were not violated," the source said. Ultimately, it was Kushner and Trump who pulled their children from the school.

That gave Thomas a share of the lead with Dustin Johnson (65-70), Cameron Smith (67-68) and Abraham Ancer (68-67), a Masters rookie who doesn't know this course any other way.
 "A lot of the history and things that you know about the golf course, it can sometimes hurt you this week because of what you're used to," Thomas said. "But at the end of the day, it is a lot softer and a lot more scorable."
 Progress could be measured in greens that began to pick up some pace and scoring that didn't get out of control.
 Johnson, looking every bit like the No. 1 player in the world, had four birdies on the back nine in the morning for a 65, breaking by two shots his best round at Augusta. He birdied his way through Amen Corner at the start of his second round and quickly reached 10 under.
 Johnson was slowed by a three-putt bogey on the 14th and a 3-iron that caught enough of a gust to come up short on the par-5 15th and roll back into the water, leading to another bogey.
 He finished with a birdie for a 70 and was atop the leaderboard with the others at 9-under 135 when the second round was halted by darkness, a product of a weather delay at the start of the tournament that has put the Masters behind schedule.
 The forecast for the weekend is favorable, warm and mostly sunny.
 "I think it can firm up a little bit, but it's going to be tough for it to get firm," Johnson said. "I think it's going to be soft enough to where you're going to have to attack the golf course and play aggressive and keep swinging like I am. I like where I'm at. I like my position."
 Still to be determined is what that position will be. Hideki Matsuyama was at 8 with three holes remaining, while Jon Rahm was at 8 under and had six holes left, including both par 5s on the back nine.

Those are the shortest holes, of course, but they're usually the most devilish. They're all about touch, not strength.
 Ancer birdied three of them during the second round, a big reason the Masters rookie left the course tied for the lead.
 DeChambeau will simply be trying to make the cut when he returns Saturday morning to complete his final six holes of his second round. He played the first dozen at 3 over, leaving him a whopping 10 strokes behind Ancer and three others at the top of the leaderboard.
 Hardly what was expected from a guy who has transformed his body into something resembling an NFL middle linebacker, who overpowered the U.S. Open field at Winged Foot to capture his first major title, who brashly set par at Augusta as 67 rather than 72.
 "I can reach all the par 5s in two, no problem," boasted DeChambeau, who has sought to normalize the idea of 400-yard drives and swing speeds that can hold their own against an Indy race car.
 If Augusta's four par 5s become par 4s on DeChambeau's presumptive and presumptuous scorecard, that surely means the third hole -- at 350 yards, by far the shortest par 4 on the course -- is marked down to a par 3 at Bryson's Mammoth Tee Shot Emporium.
 Well, you're not going to believe what happened at No. 3.
 Exhaling loudly before his club wind-milled around with frightening speed, DeChambeau took aim with his driver down the left side of the fairway, the green clearly in his sights.
 But the ball rocketed further left than he intended, touching down in a patch of thick grass still dampened from heavy rain this week. It was traveling with such force that it plugged deep into the ground.
 DeChambeau and about 15 others -- officials, workers, anyone else standing around in the sparse gallery at this patron-less Masters -- scoured the turf for a full three minutes, poking and prodding at the ground.
 No ball.
 "When you have Bryson hitting it as hard as he hits it, it's kind of hooking with not much spin into a soft area ... we were all confident it was pretty buried and it was going to be hard to find," said playing partner Jon Rahm, who also joined the search party.
 Since there also were no immediate reports of it popping out on the other side of the world, DeChambeau was left to take the Ride of Shame. A cart ferried him back to the tee box to hit again. He wound up making a triple-bogey 7 at a hole that has yielded an average score of 3.966.
 (FWIW, Golf.com reported the ball was found about 10 minutes later by a gallery guard, no more than 10 feet off the fairway, but only visible to someone right on top of it.)
 When you combine the triple-bogey with another 7 on Thursday -- when DeChambeau drove one behind a pine tree, yanked the next shot into some azalea bushes, hit a provisional into Rae's Creek, found his first ball, took a penalty drop, chunked a chip and wound up making double bogey at the third- easiest hole on the course -- it's easy to see why he's in the predicament he's in.
 It doesn't matter that he's got nine birdies on his card and the top spot in the entire field in driving distance -- 13 yards clear of the next man.
 While DeChambeau was making a mess of things, 63-year-old Bernhard Langer was methodically plodding his way around the course.
 The diminutive German ranks 88th out of 91 players in driving distances, but he's tied for third in driving accuracy, missing just three fairways in the first two rounds.
 The result: Langer is 3 under and assured of becoming the oldest player in Masters history to make the cut.
 "Drove the ball well and putted fairly well, and that kept me in there even though I'm hitting very long clubs," Langer said. "I like this golf course. I think I know how to get around it, even though I hit very long clubs. But it's certainly not easy. It's a long hitter's place. Always has been."
 Fortunately, there's more to Augusta than who hits it the farthest.
 We got a reminder of that Friday.
 No offense to DeChambeau, but that was very reassuring.

 Cleveland's week after the bye began with quarterback Baker Mayfield missing practice Monday after he was placed on the reserve/COVID list last weekend when the Browns were off. Mayfield had close contact with the unidentified positive staffer. He returned on Wednesday.
 The Browns have held all their meetings virtually this week, and players were required to wear a mask or shield during practice.
 NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Sunday's game against the Texans at FirstEnergy Stadium will not be affected.
 "There's no change to the status of the game," McCarthy said in an email. "The goal is to test, isolate the individual, conduct contact tracing and stop the spread of transmission amongst the club. We have been successful in doing so and everyone in the NFL family will continue to remain vigilant in fighting the virus."
 Stefanski said his players adjusted well during an extraordinary week.

The 50th District has a nearly 10-point GOP registration edge. The seat was vacated earlier this year by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter after he pleaded guilty to a federal corruption charge.

Cuomo said Friday that Trump's comments were false, noting that New York was among several states that have established scientific panels to independently approve any coronavirus vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration "to give people confidence in the approval process" in light of concerns that it has been politicized.
 "As soon as the FDA approves it, we will have our panel approve it, seven other states will review it," Cuomo said. "And then I can say to the people of New York, 'I know you were dubious, but we had a separate panel review it -- it's safe, take it.'"
 Cuomo said that the state panel's review of the FDA's protocol in approving a potential vaccine would be "simultaneous" with the delivery of the vaccine, such that "there will be no delay -- as soon as they get us the drug, we are ready to distribute it."
 But Cuomo expressed confidence that such a review would not reveal any problems with a potential vaccine.
 "I don't think the FDA is going to play games at this point," he said. "So I don't anticipate any real issue."
