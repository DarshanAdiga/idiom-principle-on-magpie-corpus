Up to one-third of Swiss people say they will probably shun public transport in favour of individual means like cars, bikes, or motorbikes after the Covid-19 crisis.
 According to the survey carried out by the auditing group Deloitte Switzerland, such attitudes are largely driven by a fear of infection in public transport.
 As a result, a quarter of those surveyed said they will be less inclined to use trains, buses, trams or taxis, while a third said they will more often use bikes, electric scooters, or their legs.
 Younger respondents (under 30 years old) in particular said they were more likely to use individual motorised forms of transport in future, including cars (26%), and motorbikes (29%).
 While this could lead to some difficulties regarding the push to lower carbon emissions, Deloitte said, there is also a general downturn in the attractivity of air travel. Some 27% of occasional flyers said they would do so less in the future.
 According to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office, the average Swiss person spent some 90 minutes daily travelling before the current pandemic, half of which was for leisure reasons.
 Deloitte recommended that authorities consider options like staggered rush hours – which could go hand in hand with more flexible working hours and home office options – and the renting or sharing of e-bikes, in order to adapt to the changing attitudes.
 The survey was carried out in mid-April among 1,500 Swiss residents.

NEW ORLEANS, La. (WVUE) -A typical early summer pattern will return to the area today. Spotty to scattered storms are expected each day with highs in the mid to upper 80s. A few downpours are possible, especially on Wednesday. Otherwise, expect partly to mostly cloudy skies each day.The forecast for this weekend and early next week is highly dependent on the future of Tropical Depression #3. Over the next couple of days, it will meander in the Bay of Campeche, but my late week, it may start to make a move north toward the central Gulf. This would push deep tropical moisture toward parts of the northern Gulf Coast. For now, it is a wait-and-see situation for the FOX 8 viewing area.Any potential impacts from this system- from heavy rain to gusty winds- would not arrive until the weekend or early next week.Copyright 2020 WVUE.

Labour as a factor of production is a valuable service rendered by a human agent in the production of goods and services. The outcome is generation of wealth and welfare. In common parlance, the term labour would cover manual and other kinds of services. Even in this day and age of increased automation in the production process, labour remains an important component. In India, the labour market basically constitutes the formal (organised) and informal (unorganised) sector. As per the Economic Survey 2019-20, total formal employment in India increased from eight per cent in 2011-12 to 9.98 per cent in 2017-18. Thus, the informal sector still provides substantial employment.

A sorpresa Alison (indossando guanti e mascherina), la terza dei sette figli dell'attore e regista, gli porta una torta di compleanno e tutti intorno a lui iniziano a cantare "Tanti auguri papà". Clint Eastwood sorride, un po' imbarazzato, e pronuncia un'unica frase: "Knock it off" ("Smettetela"). Una risposta che scatena le risate intorno a lui e che è tipica dei personaggi cinici e scorbutici che ha interpretato in 65 anni di carriera.

"I have missed it so much it's unbelievable," Klopp told the BBC."I know it's not the most important thing in life but it is my passion. I hope the people are looking forward to it because we are."After such a long wait to win the Premier League, Liverpool face the anti-climax of doing so in front of empty stands with all remaining 92 league games to be played behind closed doors.A year ago to the day, tens of thousands of fans poured onto the streets around Liverpool to celebrate a sixth European Cup win.And Klopp insisted there will be a parade to celebrate the title, even if it is many months after the league is won."If we become champions, whatever celebrations are possible we will do as a team internally and with all our supporters in the moment we are allowed to do so again," he added."I can promise that if it happens, there will be a parade as well. Whenever. Who cares! We only need one day when everybody is able to come and then we will do that."Klopp's men are also well on course to smash the record points tally in the Premier League, set by Manchester City who registered 100 two seasons ago.Liverpool have already racked up 82 points with 27 still to play for and Klopp does not want to see any easing up towards the end of the campaign."It's nice to think about it but we are not champions yet and we know that," he said. "We know we are close but close is not there. There are 27 points left for us and we will try everything to take them all."We are still not champions. We have to play football games and we have to win them."We don't want to stop winning after two games or whatever it is. I don't see results written in the stars; we have to work really hard."",

On the back of growing population and economic development around the world combined with rising energy demand among residential, commercial and public services, and transport sector, the global Regenerative Fuel Cell (RFC) Market is estimated to witness exuberant growth over the forecast period, i.e., 2020-2028. According to IEA (International Energy Agency), the worldwide energy demand grew by 4% (900TWh) in 2018. In the same year, the estimation of total electricity production across the globe was attained through coal and natural gas, with coal contributing to 25.6% and natural gas with 27.9% of the total production. Additionally, there is a rising demand for clean, sustainable and eco-friendly energy generation due to increased concerns pertaining to rise in CO2 emissions from energy generation.

Increased antibiotics use in combating the Covid-19 pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond, the World Health Organization said Monday.WHO director- general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a "worrying number" of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them.The UN health agency said it was concerned that the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the coronavirus crisis would further fuel the trend."The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increased use of antibiotics, which ultimately will lead to higher bacterial resistance rates that will impact the burden of disease and deaths during the pandemic and beyond," Tedros told a virtual press conference from the WHO's Geneva headquarters.The WHO said only a small proportion of Covid-19 patients needed antibiotics to treat subsequent bacterial infections.The organisation has issued guidance to medics not to provide antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild Covid-19, or to patients with moderate illness without a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection.Tedros said the guidelines said should help tackle antimicrobial resistance while saving lives.He called the threat of antimicrobial resistance "one of the most urgent challenges of our time"."It's clear that the world is losing its ability to use critically important antimicrobial medicines," he said.Highlighting inappropriate usage, he said there was an "overuse" of antibiotics in some countries, while in low- income states, such life-saving medicines were unavailable, "leading to needless suffering and death".- Disease treatment disrupted -Meanwhile the WHO said the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) had been severely disrupted since the Covid-19 pandemic began in December, following a survey of 155 countries."This situation is of significant concern because people living with NCDs are at higher risk of severe Covid-19-related illness and death," it said.The survey, during a three-week period in May, found that low-income countries were most affected.Some 53 percent of countries reported partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment.The figure was 49 percent for diabetes treatment and related complications; 42 percent for cancer treatment, and 31 percent for cardiovascular emergencies. The most common reasons for discontinuing or reducing services were cancellations of planned treatments, a decrease in available public transport and a lack of staff because health workers had been reassigned to COVID-19 treatment.- Mass gatherings risk -The WHO warned about the dangers of mass gatherings, as protests rage in the United States and elsewhere over the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd, and as sports events begin a tentative resumption."Mass gatherings have the potential to act as super- spreading events," warned Tedros, highlighting WHO guidance designed to help organisers determine how such events can be held safely.The WHO was asked about the street protests in the United States and the fear that they could increase the spread of the virus."With increasing social mixing and people coming together, particularly in areas if the virus is not under control, that close contact between people can pose a risk," answered the organisation's Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove -- stressing that she was speaking about mass gatherings in general.People planning mass events should undertake a "very serious, rigorous risk assessment", she said."Physical distancing remains a very important aspect to control and suppression of transmission of Covid-19. This is not over yet," the expert said.- South America yet to peak -The novel coronavirus has infected at least 6.2 million people and killed more than 373,000 since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that infection rates in South America were "far from stable" following a rapid increase in cases.Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico were among the 10 reporting the highest new number of cases in the past 24 hours."Central and South America in particular have very much become the intense zones for transmission of this virus," Ryan said."I don't believe we have reached the peak in that transmission and, at this point, I cannot predict when we will."

LAS VEGAS (AP) — An officer has been shot in Las Vegas and authorities are responding to another shooting as people protest the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, authorities said. The officer was shot in the area of the Las Vegas Strip and an officer was involved in a shooting in the downtown area, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department reported early Tuesday.Protesters have been rallying for days across the country over the death of George Floyd, who was seen on video pleading that he couldn't breathe with a white police officer pressing his knee into his neck for several minutes before he stopped moving.Police in Las Vegas said Monday that 338 people were arrested during three nights of protests. Officers used tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds late Saturday downtown and Sunday on the Las Vegas Strip. Police said suspects were jailed despite a local court policy calling for most people accused of misdemeanor crimes to receive court summonses instead of time behind bars to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

EAST TEXAS (KLTV/KTRE) - Good morning, East Texas! Another mild start with temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s this morning. Expect a mix of clouds and sun today with the chance for a few showers and thundershowers to pop up this afternoon. Temperatures will reach the mid 80s with light southeast winds. Tomorrow looks much the same with partly to mostly cloudy skies and another chance for a few afternoon showers and thundershowers. By the end of the week, chances for rain are dwindling away and temperatures are warming up. Afternoon highs will reach the lower 90s Thursday and Friday afternoon and the mid 90s this weekend. Slight chances for rain return Sunday and increase into Monday, but these chances are very dependent on what happens in the Gulf of Mexico. Currently, Tropical Depression #3 is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm later today. If this storm drifts toward the Texas coast, rain chances will increase for early next week.Copyright 2020 KLTV/KTRE. All rights reserved.
