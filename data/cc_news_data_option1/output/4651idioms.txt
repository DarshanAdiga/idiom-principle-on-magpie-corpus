Sure we might have been tough on them at times but it was the same when I was a kid coming through. And if you ask any of them now, they’ll admit it was character building.
 Marshall has the character – and he had it when he was a teenager. He was launched into the team at half-time when we beat Barcelona after Rab Douglas had been sent off.
 His performance at the Nou Camp is famous. But those were not isolated displays. He’s done that over a number of years.
 People think goalkeepers are daft but Marshall certainly bucks the trend. He’s a smart lad who is down to earth to boot.
 Celtic fans must see Marshall perform like that and think the club missed a trick in not bringing him back when they couldn’t get Fraser Forster. That’s nothing against Vasilis Barkas but Marshall would have been a safe pair of hands in a season where they couldn’t afford to take any chances.
 It’s done now and I am just delighted for him and for Scotland.

“Every little bit helps. If $1 makes a difference in a soldier getting the help they needs or committing suicide, it’s worth every wet rainy day or hot sunny day out here sweatting,” Johnston said. “It’s such a terrible loss to hear these mostly young soldiers taking their lives. They’re willing to give their lives for this country, and when they come home, the country should try to take care of them.”


  Each participant sets up a fundraiser page on Facebook as they go about their 100-mile goal throughout the month. The money and distance goal that Johnston set out for is well within reach now two weeks into the month as he is over halfway on his goal on the miles walked, and is nearing the $2,000 goal on his Facebook fundraiser page.


  Johnston walks somewhere between four and five miles a day, with the lighter four-mile days coming on days he has physical therapy in the afternoon. He can be seen walking around the McClendon Hills neighborhood daily, rain or shine. Even the downpours of the past week couldn’t slow him down.


  “There’s a lot of people that I know that can’t do this. This is just a little water,” Johnston said. “I know people out there that have lost their legs and are having trouble walking, and there’s some people out there who have committed suicide and they don’t have opportunity.”


  Johnston’s wife Lynne has been by his side through times where PTSD has brought him down, and said that walking is a perfect way for her goal-oriented husband to get out and about, with his service dog, a goldendoodle named Colonel Beauregard Mustard, walking by his side.


  “Because of his PTSD, he does much better if he’s outside in nature,” she said. “He’s hit the ground running with this, and even though he has Parkinson’s as well, he just keeps pushing through. And I get reports from all my neighbors saying they saw Byron and the Colonel.”

But as his tremor became more pronounced, his medical team were to suggest a fairly new, groundbreaking, invasive treatment. And he insists that his decision to agree to the procedure was game-changing.
 “I didn’t think it was that bad a tremor, but my consultant and Parkinson’s Disease nurse clearly thought otherwise,” explained Scott.
 “I was two or three years in, and they suggested deep brain stimulation, where they put two electrodes through your skull into your brain, connected by a wire that runs under your scalp, down your neck and into a pacemaker battery in a plate in the shoulder blade. It gives out electric pulses to mimic dopamine.
 “When I was told about deep brain stimulation, I spoke to my gaffers at the fire brigade and they offered me a year’s sabbatical to see how it was going to be after the surgery. But the way I looked at it, I couldn’t have trusted myself up ladders because, after you’ve had the 10-hour operation, you’re not allowed to drive for seven months.
 “I had 10 years’ service as a retained fire fighter. I told them they’d be better using the year they’d offered me to train up someone else. And I retired.”
 Although Scott can experience the side effect dyskinesia – involuntary, erratic, writhing movements of the face, arms, legs or trunk – he says the benefits of the procedure greatly outweigh any negative consequences.
 “Deep brain stimulation stopped the tremor altogether,” said Scott, 53, who blames his Parkinson’s on the chemicals he used— often without wearing a face covering – throughout his 15 years in the horticulture industry.
 “It was like night and day. If I switch the battery off, I cannot sit still.”
 Scott’s attitude and outlook on learning, 12 years ago, that he has Parkinson’s remains resolute today, and he enthusiastically channels the dwindling energy he has into helping other younger people accept that they can continue to have a fulfilling life with the condition.
 He shares his South Lanarkshire home with his five-year-old springer spaniel cocker cross, Clover, who gives him an incentive to walk up to two miles every morning, and cuddles in to keep him company in the dark, cold evenings.

Seeing him out and about has led many neighbors to asking how they can contribute to the cause.


  Byron Johnston credits his wife for being a major part of his support system in his times of depression when he contemplated suicide. Also a major part in the low points of his life was the Department of Veterans Affairs that provided him with the proper counselors and support.


  According to the VA, 17 soldiers die from suicide each day, and Johnston said he hopes that more awarness and funding for programs could help lower that number.


  “I could’ve been one of those statistics,” he said. “My wife took care of me, but not everyone has that option or has that support system. These organizations provide that critical first step.”


  Johnston retired from the Army in 2014 after 20 years splitting his time between the Army Reserve and active duty, and stayed in the area after being stationed at Fort Bragg.


  Along with the VA, Johnston said that other resources like Disabled American Veterans, the Wounded Warrior Project and Veterans of Foreign Wars posts also have the resources and the support system that many veterans need to prevent from committing suicide.


  “These soldiers deserve for their country to take care of them if they have been injured,” Johnston said. “Not all injuries are visible as they say. In fact, the ones that are harder to heal are the ones you don’t see.”

1\. Beat the pandemic
 Most economists agree that until the coronavirus pandemic is contained, US President-elect Joe Biden will struggle to rebuild the economy. As soon as he takes office on January 20th, the Democrat has promised to assemble a new coronavirus taskforce. Boosted by the announcement of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has 90% efficacy, Biden will be able to reassure American voters of light at the end of the tunnel, if, as is widely expected, he announces a second nationwide shutdown.
 One of Biden's coronavirus advisors, Michael Osterholm, has warned that the US is headed for "COVID-hell" due to the virus still spreading exponentially. On Thursday, the US recorded a new daily record of 150,000 infections, pushing the overall total past 10.4 million. Osterholm predicted that a 4-6 week nationwide lockdown would bring infections right down until the vaccine can be distributed.
 Several US states and cities have already imposed their own restrictions but the new lockdown plan faces resistance from Republicans who have opposed a tougher response under outgoing president Donald Trump. Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves has vowed that his state will not comply with any strict new curbs and says the president doesn't have the constitutional authority to issue a nationwide lockdown order.

However, as readers of this column will know, I have been putting my faith in the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, and to be frank this may prove to be the most reliable and cost effective option because the Pfizer dose has to be stored at unbelievably low temperatures,meaning the logistics surrounding its delivery will be very complex.


  Interesting, isn’t it, that the company has received such huge orders from the EU with no published data and no clear explanation as to how the delivery problems are going to be addressed.


  Then, the EU does move in mysterious ways.


  Still, this is a very intense race and for good measure the Russians have got into the game.


  Just 48 hours after Pfizer announced its vaccine of 90% efficacy, in jump the Russians with a dose called Sputnik V which they say had reached 92%. I’m just waiting for news from North Korea.


  Irrespective of the joy and hope the prospect of a vaccine brings we still face the stark reality that this killer virus stalks the land.


  Spare a thought for America, where the death toll has reached 245,000.

 At one of the early sessions he attended, he was the first to stand up and declare that his medication was responsible for giving him the gambling addiction that cost him so much more than the money he blew.
 “Nobody used to talk about things like that,” he said.
 “At one of the YP events I went to in Stirling, someone who was giving a talk just happened to say something about the side effects of some of the drugs and asked if anyone had experienced them.
 “I decided to stand up and talk about my gambling addiction. Two or three other people in that room then said they’d had the same problem, but never wanted to speak about it before. It was amazing.
 “At the YP events, I felt that I could help people by talking to them, and some have said I’ve made them feel at peace and glad they came.
 “I find it easy to speak to folk face-to-face, to calm them down a bit and make them look at having Parkinson’s through a different pair of eyes.

FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) — Wooden sculptures of characters like “The Lorax” from the children’s book by Dr. Seuss, will soon be on display at John F. Kennedy Memorial Park in Fort Dodge. The sculptures will be used on a story trail in the Children’s Forest area of the park. “We are putting in a story trail,” said Matt Cosgrove, director of Webster County Conservation. “There will be a loop trail in the Children’s Forest.” Cosgrove said there will be 15 stations where families can stop and read part of a story. Those stories will have the option of being changed out seasonally, he told the Fort Dodge Messenger. One story, in particular, that will be on display is “The Lorax,” a children’s book authored by Dr. Seuss. It was first published in 1971. The sculptures will be in place to enhance the storytelling. Gary Keenan, a chainsaw sculptor from Des Moines, is creating six characters from the book out of ash trees. More and more ash trees are in danger due to emerald ash borer, an invasive insect that feeds under the bark of ash trees. It disrupts the transport of nutrients and water throughout the tree, which ultimately kill it. As a result, many ash trees in Webster County are being removed. Rather than dispose of the stumps, Erin Ford, a naturalist with Webster County Conservation, thought it would be a neat use of the wood to have them made into sculptures. So Ford connected with Keenan about the story trail project, which is funded by the Webster County Friends of Conservation Board. The cost of the sculptures will be about $4,200. Keenan, a former locksmith, has been at his craft for 20 years. “All my life, I’ve had an appreciation for art,” he said. “Especially sculptures.” One year, a friend of his saw a chainsaw artist at the...

  Top-seeded Lakeside Lutheran secured a 31-10 WIAA Division 3 first-round victory, building a 24-0 first-quarter lead on the strength of two fumble recoveries for touchdowns.


  “The defense came up big for us, and got us off to the fast start with two defensive scores and then in the second half made it stand up,” Lakeside Lutheran coach Paul Bauer said. “It got a little close, but it seemed like every time we got in trouble, they’d come up with a turnover or an interception.

It's that season! Yes, it's the holiday season, but it's also the "how do I get rid of the turkey leftovers" season. The recipes I'm sharing today are Chez Lolly-approved by family and friends.      LITTLE GOBBLER CROISSANT SANDWICHES   One of my social media friends told me about a sandwich that her mama served their family after Thanksgiving. It sounded amazing to me, and I decided to try it out for our family. We all love it!      • Croissants (cut in half lengthwise)   • Cream cheese (I used the whipped version so it will be easy to spread)   • Sliced turkey   • Cranberry sauce      Spread a liberal serving of cream cheese on each half of the croissant.      Pile on the turkey slices and then spoon over as much or little cranberry sauce as you'd like. Top with that other half of the croissant. Refrigerate until ready to serve.      TURKEY AND SAUSAGE GUMBO   It's a tradition in our family to have gumbo on hand for the busy weekend following Thanksgiving. Have all the ingredients prepared and ready to go. Once the roux is ready, you'll add all the veggies at one time.   • 12 to 14 cups turkey stock (preferably homemade)   • 1 cup flour   • 1 cup vegetable oil   • 1 large yellow onion, chopped   • 3 ribs celery, chopped   • 1 large green bell pepper, seeded and chopped   • 2 teaspoons chopped garlic   • 16 ounces package Cajun-style smoked sausage, diced and browned   • 2 to 3 cups chopped turkey   • 1 to 2 tablespoons Cajun or Creole seasoning   • 2 bay leaves   • Cooked white rice   • Chopped parsley   • Thinly sliced green onions      In a large Dutch oven (7 quarts), bring turkey stock to a gentle simmer.      In a large cast-iron skillet, add the flour and oil. Turn heat to medium high and, continually stirring, begin to make the roux. You must stir the mixture constantly so it won't burn.      When the roux reaches the color of peanut butter, add the onions, celery and bell pepper all at once and stir. The vegetables will cool the roux so that it stops cooking, and the heat from the roux will soften the veggies.      Lower the heat to medium low and let the vegetables cook for 4 to 5 minutes, frequently stirring. Add the garlic and let cook another minute or so.      Add the vegetables to the simmering stock. Next, add in the browned sausage and turkey. Stir in the Creole seasoning and add the bay leaves.   Bring the gumbo up to a gentle simmer and let cook for an hour or so. Remove the bay leaves before serving over cooked rice. Garnish with parsley and/or green onions.      CREAMY TURKEY AND WILD RICE SOUP   This recipe, courtesy of Food and Wine, was adapted from a chicken and wild rice recipe into a turkey and wild rice recipe.      • 4 tablespoons unsalted butter   • 2 carrots, cut into inch pieces   • 3 celery ribs, cut into inch pieces   • 1 medium onion, chopped   • 2 garlic cloves, minced   • 1 teaspoon finely chopped thyme   • Salt   • Pepper   • 1/4 cup all-purpose flour   • 1 cup wild rice (5 ounces)   • 2 quarts chicken stock or low-sodium broth   • 2 cups of water   • 4 cups bite-size pieces of roasted turkey (or chicken)   • 1 cup heavy cream   • Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish      Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Add the carrots, celery, onion, garlic, thyme and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Cook over moderate heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes.      Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and cook, stirring, until evenly coated and lightly browned, about 3 minutes. Add the wild rice to the saucepan and gradually stir in the stock and water.      Bring to a boil, then simmer over moderately low heat, occasionally stirring, until the vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes.      Add the turkey (or chicken) and simmer, occasionally stirring, until the wild rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Stir in the cream and season with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into bowls, garnish with fresh chopped parsley and serve.

Andrea Leiblein, 63, lifelong resident of Quincy, died on November 7, 2020, while being treated and cared for in her transition at Care One in Weymouth, in coordination with Dana Farber Cancer Center. Her parents, Audrey and Edward Leiblein, predeceased her, as well as her twin sister, Althea Leiblein. Survived by her sister, Adelle Leiblein and her husband David Tracey of Sebring, Florida, and her aunt, Hilda Leiblein Marrigan of The Villages in Florida, and many cousins through out New England. Andrea pursued a degree in Biology at the University of Massachusetts, after graduating from Quincy High School. Just a few credits shy of a B.S. degree, she worked in a number of commercial laboratories in the Boston area, including Corning Medical Group on isotopes. After work in Science, Andrea changed paths and moved to retail sales in women's wear at stores like Lord and Taylor. She received many kudos from Lord and Taylor, retiring from there as a client stylist. Upon retirement, she moved to Town Brook House in Quincy, enjoying different apartments over the years and a community of friendship with residents and staff. Throughout her life, Andrea made significant contributions to non-profits. She served as a volunteer at Carney Hospital for over ten years; volunteered with Quincy food pantries as a distribution helper; gave 100s of hours to the Quincy Historical Society that is housed at the Adams Academy; contributing often to Dove Shelter, and as a presenter/ interpreter of the collection at Forbes Museum. Most recently working as a volunteer clerical assistant in Quincy Courts' Parole Office. As a devoted animal lover, Andrea raised and adored many cats and dogs. She had a way of calming and caring for her pets that gave them a good life filled with affection. Her interest in gardening enhanced the family gardens; she loved big band music and oldies, and possessed expert knowledge of classic movies and actors from the 1920s to today. Her winning ways at Jeopardy and Trivial Pursuit were unbeatable. Andrea was a member of Quincy Point Congregational Church. Her Christian faith sustained her through her life. After cremation, Andrea's ashes will be commingled with her twin sister Althea's, placed in an urn and scattered at sea. There are no services, as was Andrea's wish. The family thanks all who cared for Andrea and welcome kind thoughts and prayers for their beloved Andrea.

Another obstacle: for a vaccine to work, people need to actually receive it—but survey data suggest that many Americans aren’t on board. The chart below, adapted from STAT and The Harris Poll, shows that only about 58% of Americans surveyed in October plan to get a vaccine as soon as one is available—down from 69% in August. The hesitancy is even more pronounced among Black Americans, with only 43% reportedly planning to get vaccinated right away.

At the service, the pastor asked us to share memories, and one of my favorite memories of my brother was we’d visit him in California. In the redwood forest, he would always have a fancy picnic. He would have a lace tablecloth and candlesticks. Once there was a silver chafing dish with curried shrimp, once it was beef sandwiches au jus and a hot thermos. People would come by and stare at us. In the middle of the redwood forest, he would have these beautiful, elegant picnics. So this summer our family is going to get together and do a picnic in one of our parks.

 The scenes at the end and the interview with Christie were   brilliant. I had it myself, people saying you don’t care about your country. It’s utter nonsense.
 Nobody knows what goes on inside dressing rooms. But these Scotland players have shown now exactly what it means to them.
 Representing my country meant the world to me. Not reaching a major championship will always be a huge regret.
 It has come full circle in a way because my abiding memory as a Scotland supporter as a youngster was seeing Coisty’s goal against Switzerland at the Euros in 1996.
 That was the moment it struck me that I wanted to be like these guys. I was just turning pro and was hungry to achieve everything possible.

The first drug he was prescribed was commonly used to treat restless leg syndrome.
 But its seemingly routine administering was to have severe, psychological side effects on Scott – and he was to feel the devastating consequences it would have on the aspects of his life he held most dear for years to come.
 “It gave me an online gambling addiction,” said Scott, whose previous gambling habits amounted to nothing more than pressing a few coins into the bandit in his local pub.
 “I gambled £10,000 in a month — credit cards, debit cards, you name it.
 “I honestly didn’t realise I was gambling as much. £50 was like a fiver in my head. I was getting such a buzz from it – euphoria.
 “One month into it, I got my bank statement and my business statement through, and there it was in black and white — the money was all gone, more or less. I phoned up my nurse that same day and she told me to stop taking it right there and then.
 “I had to take advice, and that advice was to go bankrupt. I had doctors, GPs and consultants write letters to the bank to see if they would write off the debt because my gambling addiction had been caused by a prescribed drug. But nobody was interested. I sold my business and went bankrupt. And that put a further strain on my relationship.
 “Two years into my diagnosis, I ended up splitting up with my partner of 17 years. That was not all due to Parkinson’s, but it didn’t help.”
 Scott’s medication was immediately changed to Sinemet – a drug that has been on the market for 60 years and one that he still takes to this day.

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) — A pilot was seriously injured when a small plane crashed in a dry riverbed near an inland Southern California airfield Friday night, authorities said. The single-engine Cessna was coming in for a landing at San Bernardino International Airport around 8 p.m. when the pilot reported engine trouble, said Eric Sherwin, spokesman for the San Bernardino County Fire Department. The plane crashed and broke apart about a mile south of the airport. “It was a violent impact,” Sherwin said.

LARNED -- Heart of Kansas Family Health Care in Larned has been recognized for its many contributions to its patients and the community, said Alex Filbert, executive director of the Larned Area Chamber of Commerce.


   


  The Small Business of the Year Award was announced recently during a special coffee hour and open house; the chamber's annual banquet was canceled because of COVID-19 concerns.


   


  "We sponsor the Community Awards annually to recognize our very deserving businesses, organizations and individuals that go above and beyond to serve our community," Filbert said.


   


  Criteria for the small-business award include: employing fewer than 15 people; providing excellent customer service; participating in philanthropic activities; being community-minded; and providing workforce development.


   


  The Heart of Kansas nomination letter indicated, in part, that the clinic at 522 Broadway "helped our community by expanding local healthcare within the past year."


   


  Filbert said the recognition was deserved because "we value Heart of Kansas as one of our outstanding chamber businesses. Yes, they provide high-quality healthcare but they also create and retain job opportunities and are true community partners."


   


  The chamber's all-day open house allowed local and area residents to stop by and celebrate the awards in person or virtually.


   


  "We encouraged social distancing, handwashing and face masks to err on the side of caution," Filbert said. "We certainly missed the camaraderie of our banquet setting but this was a nice substitute."


   


  Heart of Kansas Family Health Care is a Federally Qualified Health Center, which allows it to be a safety net for patients who are uninsured or underinsured. Its professional providers also welcome those with insurance at the Great Bend, Larned and Stafford locations. Heart of Kansas is open to everyone.
