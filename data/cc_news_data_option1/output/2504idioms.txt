First off, it is clear that this TV has been used before -- the TV stand screws were in a sandwich bag, and I could see some minor scuffs on the rear of the TV. Also, the TV’s box has clearly seen more than the typical shipping action. From conversations I have had with representatives at Samsung, I have also learned that getting review samples out to reviewers has been difficult given the global coronavirus pandemic and that part of that struggle meant the unit I received was probably not checked before it was shipped to me.

Land Rover estimates it can go from zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds, with a top speed of 177 mph. That’s good for such a heavy vehicle but, unfortunately for Land Rover, there are a lot of high-performance SUVs on sale today. The Velar has a lot more power than a BMW X3 M Competition, Mercedes-AMG GLC63, or Porsche Macan Turbo, but it can’t better their zero-to-60 mph times. Out of the box, the Macan Turbo matches the Velar’s time, and it can do 4.1 seconds with the optional Sport Chrono package, according to Porsche. BMW quotes 4.0 seconds for the X3 M Competition, while Mercedes claims the GLC63 can reach 60 mph from a standstill in just 3.8 seconds.

One advantage to the Flex 5's thickness is that it packs in a fair amount of connectivity. There are two USB-A 3.1 ports, a USB-C 3.1 port, a full-size HDMI 1.4 port, and a 4-in-1 SD card reader. Though Thunderbolt 3 is missing, many will appreciate the inclusion of some of those legacy ports, which come in handy. Wireless connectivity is still limited to Wi-Fi 5 rather than the more recent Wi-Fi 6 standard, and Bluetooth 4.2 is on board.

Whether it was something you started brainstorming right away or something that occurred to you somewhere along in the quarantined state of the world, “How can I use this time to reinvent myself?” is likely a question you’ve thought about in the past however many weeks or so. We are in the slow but sure process of unfreezing things, and that thawing process coincidentally is coinciding with Pride season.

Upon leaving the Middle Eastern country of Qatar, former Dodge City Community College basketball player Ameer Jackson is back in Dodge City, albeit temporarily.
   
 Originally from the Charlotte, North Carolina area, Jackson was recruited by then DCCC head basketball coach Kyle Campbell in 2013 when Jackson was a senior year at the Evelyn Mack Academy.
   
 "He ended up driving 22 hours to Kanapolis (North Carolina) to come and see me and talk to my family," said Jackson.
   
 Jackson played basketball at DCCC for two years and was an all-conference honorable mention in the Kansas Jayhawk Community College Conference.
   
 In 2015, Jackson signed to Sam Houston State University right before his sophomore season. After his fourth game at Sam Houston State though, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).
   
 After going through rehab for his ACL, Jackson played Division 2 at Winston- Salem State University in North Carolina, before declaring to go pro, after half a season.
   
 Jackson signed with the CN Aurel Vlaicu Bucuret basketball club based in Bucharest, Romania, and stayed with them for a full season as a point guard, averaging about 37 points.
   
 For the 2018-19 season, Jackson signed with Al-Khor Sports Club based in Qatar and was one of three imported players, as well as the youngest on the team.
   
 "It was a learning experience on and off the court with Al-Khor," said Jackson. "I was playing against higher skilled players; it was a whole different transition."
   
 Jackson was the top scorer of the league, averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds for the season.
   
 Before he could sign to another league in Saudi Arabia, Jackson tore his ACL again and after five months in recovery, signed to another professional league in Africa.
   
 His time in Africa was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and so Jackson made the choice to come back stateside and is now in Dodge City, visiting old friends.
   
 Jackson said before too long he will go back to Kanapolis and train before deciding who he will play for this September in Qatar, where several pro- league clubs are attempting to recruit him.
   
 Jackson wants to get at least three more overseas seasons under his belt in the Middle East and win a few championships before trying to get into the NBA summer league.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — When country singer Rissi Palmer was working on her debut album, she wanted a song like Gretchen Wilson’s “Redneck Woman,” a song that would introduce her and tell her story to fans.On her 2007 debut single,&nbsp;“Country Girl,”&nbsp;she celebrated her country roots while explaining that she didn’t have to look or talk a certain way to call herself a country girl.“I said that I am not white in the first verse, and the label was like, ‘No, no, no,’” said&nbsp;Palmer,&nbsp;who then rewrote the lyrics to make it feel more universal. “It was very intentional when I wrote that song to talk about all the women, or all the people, that might not necessarily fit in the box, but are still of the same mindset.”The country music industry has long been hesitant to address its long and complicated history with race, but the death of George Floyd in police custody and the protests it sparked in the U.S. and around the world became a sound too loud for the genre to ignore.Over the past weeks, country artists, labels and country music organizations posted about Black Lives Matter on social media, participated in the industry- wide&nbsp;Blackout Tuesday&nbsp;or denounced racism outright. On Thursday, Grammy-winning country group, The Dixie Chicks announced it would drop “dixie″ from its name. The group said in&nbsp;a statement that&nbsp;it wanted to meet “this moment.”But Black artists say the industry still needs to address the systematic racial barriers that have been entrenched in country music for decades. Stereotypes that country music is just for white audiences, written by white songwriters, and sung by mostly white males are reinforced daily on country radio, playlists, label rosters and tour lineups. In recent years, however, the conversations about country music have shifted to a broader acknowledgment that non-white artists have always been in the genre, even if they aren’t always recognized.Artist/scholar&nbsp;Rhiannon Giddens&nbsp;received a MacArthur Foundation grant for her work to reclaim Black contributions to country and folk music. And artists like Darius Rucker, Kane Brown and Jimmie Allen have all had No. 1 country hits in recent years, while Mickey Guyton just released an unflinching song called&nbsp;“Black Like Me.”&nbsp;But that ingrained culture of exclusivity remains a struggle to change.“You can look at the reviews of my first album. I was called colored, like, ‘I didn’t know colored people like country music,’” said Palmer, who had three singles reach the Hot Country Songs Chart. “I used to get messages all the time on MySpace, saying, ‘I am so sick of you. Why are you trying to be white?’ or ‘Why are you trying to take over country music?’”Change hasn’t been easy. After Grammy-winning country group&nbsp;Lady Antebellum announced they were changing their name to Lady A, they later had to apologize to a Black singer who had been using that stage name for years.Atlanta-based country rapper Breland also wanted to address, with a wink and a smile, country music’s racial blinders with his TikTok-fueled song&nbsp;“My Truck.”&nbsp;The music video starts with a white guy in a black cowboy hat singing as smoke billows across a dusty landscape, then Breland abruptly shoves him out of the frame to announce, “Don’t touch my truck.”“I just felt like it was time for people to change their perspective on what country music is and what country music can be, because there is an audience of country music listeners under 30 who believe Black Lives Matter,” said Breland, whose song reached No. 26 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart and has been remixed with Sam Hunt.Like Lil Nas X’s genre-bending “Old Town Road,” Breland playfully fuses trap rhythms with country tropes about horses, do-si-dos and beer on his self- titled EP and sings with country artists Chase Rice and Lauren Alaina. Breland said country music labels can’t just continue to focus on one type of audience.“There’s a group of country listeners who love country music because of the way it sounds, but don’t love some of the politics that they know are going on behind the scenes,” he said.Historically country music was created by and played in both white and Black communities in the South, but the music became marketed along racial lines in the Jim Crow era, said Amanda Marie Martinez, a historian and writer who is studying country music and race. White country music was stigmatized early on as “hillbilly music” so the industry started pushing it toward the rising white middle class as a way to make the genre more respected and hugely profitable.“In the process, they’ve also prioritized the white, middle income, relatively conservative listener as their demographic, kind of the opposite of youth culture,” Martinez said.But there were periods of diversity, such as the post-Civil Rights era, when Black artists like Charley Pride, Linda Martell, O.B. McClinton and Stoney Edwards were having success, alongside Johnny Rodriguez and Freddy Fender, who were singing in English and Spanish.Black artists today are also reclaiming spaces that have been overwhelmingly white domains.Claude Kelly and Chuck Harmony, who work as a duo called Louis York, were already hit-making songwriters and producers behind pop songs like “Party in the USA” by Miley Cyrus and “Grenade” by Bruno Mars when they moved to Franklin, Tennessee, a Nashville suburb that is home to historical sites of a major Civil War battle and plantations where slaves were once held. There they set up their Weirdo Workshop artist collective and have worked with Jimmie Allen and noted author/poet Caroline Randall Williams.“We knew that if we were to make our mark in this town as musicians and as Black musicians that playing the Grand Ole Opry would be the pinnacle for that,” Harmony said.They got a standing ovation at the Opry, but more importantly for Harmony, he wanted the audience to learn about country music’s roots.“I just wanted their unbiased, undivided attention, so that they can make the correlation between the music that they came to see and the music that we make as Black people,” Harmony said.Both the Academy of Country Music and the Country Music Association started diversity task forces more than a year ago when country music was being criticized for a lack of female voices and women were being left out of major categories like entertainer of the year.Becky Gardenhire, a top executive at talent agency WME in Nashville who leads ACM’s diversity task force, said they are looking at ways to recruit and retain diverse voices, both in the boardroom and on the stage, with efforts like mentorships, networking and outreach to build up a pipeline of future leaders and artists.“We’re hungry for diversity. We want the candidates to come and knock on the door, but we have to also show them that the door is open for them,” said Damon Whiteside, CEO of ACM.But just as country artists outwardly reflect a predominantly white image, there are few Black country music executives working behind the scenes. Candice Watkins got one of her first big breaks in country music working as the day-to-day manager for Keith Urban between 2009 and 2011.“That changed my life because obviously he’s a superstar,” said Watkins, who is now the vice president for marketing for Big Loud Records, whose roster includes Jake Owen and Morgan Wallen.But in that manager’s role, she realized that she was often the only Black person at the boardroom table. Watkins said her label supports her and values her opinion, but she knows that might not be the same for other minorities and their companies.“How is a young A&amp;R person empowered to come back to the table and maybe pitch a Black artist or person of color? Culturally speaking, do they feel free to do that or do they automatically know this is dangerous ground for them to even bring up?” Watkins said. “There’s a dismantling of culture that needs to happen.”Palmer, who is recording a podcast that focuses on the experiences of women of color in country music, said she feels optimistic that the current discussions about race and country music can lead to progress, if real changes are implemented.“I love country music, always have, always will. It’s healing music. It’s beautiful music at its core. It’s heartfelt. It’s spiritual,” Palmer said. “And it would be a shame if not everybody got to enjoy it because of the outward package.”Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Early this week, we learned that the American Museum of Natural History in New York City will remove a statue of former President Theodore Roosevelt from outside its main entrance. The statue shows Roosevelt, the 26th president, on horseback and flanked by an African American and a Native American.
 In a statement, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, said the museum had asked to remove the statue “because it explicitly depicts black and indigenous people as subjugated and racially inferior.”
 This is an absolutely ridiculous statement for de Blasio to make and an insult to a man who was instrumental in helping win the Spanish-American War leading the Rough Riders. De Blasio and others would be wise to know that Roosevelt was the first president to invite a black man into the White House for dinner with he and his family. The man he invited was his adviser and friend, Booker T. Washington. Roosevelt was also well known to invite African Americans over to eat and sleep at his house when he was governor of New York, another unpopular move for the times.
 Doing so provoked an outpouring of condemnation from Southern politicians and press. This reaction affected subsequent White House practice, and no other African American was invited to dinner for almost 30 years.
 These aren’t the actions of a racist man, but of a man who put color aside during a time when it wasn’t popular to do so. The moving of the statue of Roosevelt is pure political correctness run amok, just as the tearing down of a statue of war hero, founding father and former President George Washington and the other statues we mentioned, especially the ones of the Emancipation Proclamation and ones of Jesus.
 It’s just beyond sad that lawless mobs almost on a daily basis are ripping down our nation’s history. Again, some of our history isn’t pretty, but it’s a history that needs to be told and learned from and the toppling of these statues makes it harder and harder to do that because we believe it’s much easier to look at something visually and try to understand and learn from it than it is in schools and the ivory towers where sadly they simply don’t teach American history like they should anymore.
 The whitewashing of our nation’s history must come to an end now otherwise future generations of Americans will have nothing to learn from.
 This we can ill afford to do.

Again, what does travel look like this summer? Let’s look at a few scenarios. Some travel may be urgent and necessary in the current environment, but undoubtedly, many travel plans have been altered or canceled in light of disruptions in the travel and tourism industries. If you plan to shelter in place or enjoy staycations closer to home, consider donating the vacation funds you budgeted to local grassroots organizations that serve communities of color impacted by COVID-19. Many of these agencies are underfunded due to lack of “the right connections” or barriers in application processes. Yet, they continue to provide basic needs to individuals and families disproportionally affected by the pandemic. [Job losses and disparities in all major social categories are significantly higher in African-American communities than those of whites.] Your financial assistance can provide critical care to those most in need.

Color accuracy in the Q90T’s Movie picture preset was good out of the box in both SDR and HDR. I made minor adjustments to the white balance which further improved color accuracy, but I think most people will be thrilled with the TVs color without adjustment. So far this year, only Sony’s X900H has provided more out-of-box color accuracy though with slightly lower color volume due to lower brightness in HDR. I still have many TVs to review, though, so I'll continue to update throughout the year.
