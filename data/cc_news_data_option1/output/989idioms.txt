For now, the German government will offer liquidity support to companies hit by the economic disruption and extend funding for temporary layoffs that help firms weather the storm.
 There will also be extra spending on health measures.
 But the finance ministry insists that there is no reason yet to unleash the large-scale stimulus that many are calling for.
 In fact, German officials have become so accustomed to calls for more spending that brushing off those demands has become second nature.
 They aren’t convinced that it would boost the rest of the eurozone much and are reluctant to pile debt onto future taxpayers.
 In the current scenario, they argue that putting money into the hands of consumers won’t do much good if the fear of infection stops them from going out and using it.
 “Some countries are less attentive to the risk, or minimise it, because they are not yet hit,” Ms Lagarde told EU leaders in a video conference.
 Evoking the crash of 2008, Ms Lagarde signaled the global dimensions of the coronavirus epidemic, in what could also be considered a veiled rallying call to global policymakers such as US President Donald Trump to escalate their response before it’s too late.

Spring has sprung, the days are getting longer, the weather is getting warmer and the flowers are opening. As a child, I remember early spring as being a riot of color and the air being filled with the sound of birds singing louder as they returned after a cold winter. The air also had a different scent and feel; I guess more humidity returning to the air. Anyway, one knew spring was on its way. It was fun to anticipate when the first signs of brown bushes would explode into color.      As spring approaches, so do some of my favorite flowering shrubs. These early spring flowering plants brighten up the landscape (as well as my mood). I am crazy about some of the new shrubs that flower in March and April, but I cannot forget about the ones that I recall from my childhood. Those that created the nostalgic memories that I cherish.      I was one of five girls and we all walked to school, as did all of our friends. As you walked, you tended to notice more. We passed by houses that had some of the same shrubs in their garden that we had in ours. People in those days did not have very sophisticated bushes; the houses with prettier yards were because of the placement of plants rather than having unusual plant material.      As I think back on what blooming shrubs we had to look forward to, the vibrant yellow flowers of two shrubs come to mind first. Forsythia was in many gardens and a few people had another one named Kerria japonica, or Japanese rose as some called it, which bloomed shortly after the forsythia finished flowering. Both have long arching branches and make a magnificent display of color. Forsythia flowered first and was like a ray of sunshine after the dark days of winter. The brightly colored flowers that covered the branches opened to a profusion of blooms. Then, not too long after the forsythia turned green with the new foliage, kerria would take center stage. With those long arching branches of brilliant yellow blooms, who could help but enjoy them. Both of these are extremely hardy and so easy to grow that I am sure that is why most homes grew them.      Another old-fashioned shrub is quince. I love quince not only because of my childhood memories but for other reasons too. Most of the ones that I saw growing up had red flowers and many people had this plant somewhere in their yard. The old-fashioned varieties had fruit that resembled apples. They were quite bitter and, as children, we would dare someone to take a bite of the fruit. People would make jam from the bitter, apple looking fruit that would be present in the summer. Today, the quince I grow does not have the large fruit that I remember. I guess that has been bred out of the newer varieties.      Today, I grow three different quince bushes and they are some of my favorite plants, but it is for a different reason. It might not be the prettiest bush when it is not flowering, but I love it because it is easy to force into bloom. I pick branches starting in early December and bring them in the house to open up. I do this about every two weeks after that so that I have a continuous arrangement of them blooming in the house. When I pick the first branches, it takes them longer to open, but after Christmas, it takes less and less time for them to open when I bring them into the house since they are getting closer to the time when they would naturally open.      People think I am so talented for having these flowers in the house, but all it takes is to remember to pick them and bring them in to open up. Try it next winter and you, too, will be rewarded with an abundance of flowers. The branches I do not pick look pretty over a long time in the garden. You can find quince in white, pink, red and an orange-red.      Now, if fragrance is a trait you really want to have in your garden, you cannot beat the fragrance of Daphne and Korean spice viburnum. Daphne is a low growing evergreen shrub with a wonderful fragrance that when brought in the house, will perfume a room.      Korean spice viburnum is a flowering bush that is so aromatic that it fills the air with a lovely scent when in bloom. The buds are pinkish in color and then give way to white flowers. My daughter, Laura, gave me the bush that I presently have and I think of her each time it is in flower. This somewhat larger shrub produces clusters of dainty, pastel-pink buds in late March and the spicy fragrance alone is worth growing this delightful shrub.      I do not know what plants stir up memories of your childhood, maybe you remember some of these jewels. I hope you enjoy spring and the waking up of the trees and shrubs and enjoy those lovely sounds that fill the air. I certainly do.

“You can tell that it's the third year in the system,” Pruitt remarked. “You can tell that we've got a lot of guys returning. There weren't a whole lot of mistakes, so that's good to see and we can really coach fundamentals. We're trying to slow it down this spring as far as installs. We're making sure that we teach concepts and have a really good understanding of what we're doing, and I thought our guys did a nice job with that.”
 One of the key consistent pieces on the Vols football staff has been head strength coach Craig Fitzgerald, who turned down jobs in both of the past two offseason to stay at Tennessee. Many media members interpreted a part of Pruitt’s quote as implying that Fitzgerald was offered the Alabama job.
 “I can't say enough about Craig and his guys and what they have done over the last three years,” Pruitt said. “Our guys continue to get bigger, stronger, develop discipline and a lot of mental toughness. In the offseason, Craig is a guy that is in high demand. That is no secret. There have been several jobs that have been open across our league, and Craig was the first guy that they called. He decided to stay here. He is in demand because he is good at what he does.”
 The most talked about position, quarterback is said to be up for grabs with six different players getting equal reps at the start of this spring. Joining the three returning quarterbacks are three freshmen looking to make a name for themselves.
 “(Jarrett Guarantano, JT Shrout and Brian Maurer) are going to continue to improve,” Pruitt said. “We have good competition there. Jarrett is a guy that has played a lot of ball. When you look at all three of those guys, there are a lot of positives that they do. We have to eliminate a few mistakes that we made last year. With another year in the system, that is something that we are working on. We have a couple other quarterbacks in that room. Harrison Bailey, Jimmy Holiday, Kasim Hill … the plan right now is to rep six guys. If there is a point in time where we feel like someone eliminates themselves, we would go down.”
 With their first practice down, the Vols have will look to continue to improve in the remaining 14 practices this spring.

Producing confectionary products with the use of raising agents is gaining traction across the global food production landscape. Over the forecast period, sales of raising agents across confectionary applications are expected to register a global value CAGR of 3.9%, reflecting fastest revenue growth. Fried fish product applications of raising agents are also likely to gain considerable traction in terms of revenues. The report, however, observes a declining demand for raising agents in bakery product applications. Nonetheless, bakery applications of raising agents will continue to account for largest chunk of the global revenue pie, registering a one-fourth share on global market value by 2026-end.

Johnny Miller, a graduate teaching assistant in the Department of Anthropology, was one of the students attending today’s event. He is seeking an M.A. in Mediterranean archeology.
 Miller discussed some of the financial situations that prompted him to come to the event.
 “Last semester, my mom lost her job. About a month later, she found a new job, but she doesn’t make even half as much as she did, so she can no longer lend me any help,” Miller said. “As a T.A., I get a stipend of $1,025 dollars a month. After housing, utilities and stuff like that I have maybe 50 bucks to my name for the whole month.”
 Miller also stated how essential it is for the university to try to reach students in need through events like the Awareness Day.
 “I think it is really important because there’s a huge stigma around being on any kind of welfare program, or even the language surrounding poverty, homelessness or things like that,” Miller said. “You don’t want to talk about it, you don’t want to admit that you’re going through those struggles.”
 He explained that it has been difficult for him to reach out and obtain the resources he needs to combat food insecurity.
 “For me, it took me a while to come to terms with the fact like, hey, maybe I should look into these types of programs, I should look into SNAP because I am poor. I don’t have a lot and I am worried about where my next meal is coming from,” Miller said. “You have to deal with the stigma and also personal pride of not wanting to have to rely on that kind of thing, that you want to be self-sufficient.”
 According to McCord, students may be eligible for SNAP if they are currently in a work study program, have less than $2,500 in savings and don’t have a large expected family contribution. For non-work study workers, students working a regular 80 hours per month can be eligible.

EASTON -- The four of them arrived on the campus of Stonehill College in 2016 as wide-eyed freshmen women's basketball players.
 Gabrielle Reuter of Plymouth, Grace Carter of Arlington, Kelsey Shaw of Bar Harbor, Maine and Morgan O'Brien of Clifton Park, New York would hear older teammates talk about how fast four-year careers go.
 "When we were freshmen, the seniors would say it flies by and we said, 'No way,' '' said Reuter.
 Yet here are Reuter, Carter, Shaw and O'Brien in the final chapter of their Stonehill careers, seniors taking part in the NCAA Division 2 East Regional.
 They have gone from playing on a 12-14 team that freshman season to three straight appearances in the NCAAs, including an incredible run to the Elite Eight as sophomore in 2017.
 Now, Reuter, Carter and Shaw are starting for a team that is 23-5 with 12 straight victories, including a win in the Northeast-10 Conference championship game last weekend over Saint Anselm College.
 The Skyhawks are the No. 2 seed in the East Regional and face seventh-seeded Daemen College of Amherst, New York in Garden City, New York on Friday at 2:30 p.m.
 "They have been phenomenal,'' said coach Trisha Brown of her three seniors. "The minute they arrived on campus, there was great chemistry within their class, good kids, good character kids. They've always been leaders and set a good tone in the classroom.''
 Reuter made the all-conference third team this season, averaging 10 points and 6.1 rebounds. She has started 57 of 106 games, averaging 7.1 points.
 Shaw moved into the starting lineup as a freshman and has made 84 starts in four seasons, averaging 5.6 points while Carter has started 78 games and is averaging 8.7 points this season.
 O"Brien started the season opener in November against Daemen, but she tore an anterior cruciate ligament that will require surgery after the season. O'Brien has played five games since returning in late January.
 After being part of the memorable 2017-18 season that ended with a loss in the national semifinal round, then getting two more trips to the NCAAs, it has been quite a ride for the four players.
 "The two words for it are amazing and rewarding,'' said Reuter. "The fact that we're here now after winning the NE-10 championship and going to the NCAAs is an amazing feeling.
 "It's been awesome. I'm so happy there are four of us. From the beginning, it's been awesome that we had each other.''
 The four players learned from a senior-dominated team that won the East Regional in 2018 and is using that experience now in their final seasons.
 "It's a great senior class,'' said Shaw. "They're my best friends and I can't wait to share this experience with them.
 "(Sophomore year) was crazy. It was an adventure for sure. We had great leadership and they showed us what it's like to be true leaders, on and off the court. It's really helped us this year.''
 Carter, who joined the Skyhawks as a walk-on, became a starter during her sophomore season after getting into only 10 games as a freshman.
 "We've had our ups and we've had our downs in four years,'' said Carter. "To finish it together in this fashion with an NE-10 championship and going on to the NCAAs, you couldn't ask for anything better for us.
 "It's been an honor to be on this team for four years. Coach gave me the opportunity to play and I've been on teams that have done exceptionally well.''
 O'Brien played a career-best 19 games last season, then was in the starting lineup on Nov. 8 against Daemen. But after making 6 of 7 shots and scoring 13 points in 19 minutes, she suffered the torn ACL and has played 21 minutes in five games since coming back.
 Still, O'Brien is enjoying her final season as part of a senior class that has had plenty of success together.
 "It's been so amazing,'' said O'Brien. "As a senior, to end this way with an NE-10 championship and keep going, it's been awesome.
 "Those are my best friends and it's been awesome to go through this with them. We were so young and didn't know what to expect (going to the Elite Eight). Now we know what it's like and we know what it takes to win.''
 Stonehill is three wins away from another appearance in the Elite Eight, and the seniors know what it takes to get there.
 "They've been huge for us,'' said sophomore Kayla Raymond of Easton. "We just all look up to them so much.''

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A man awaiting resentencing for an armed standoff with U.S. marshals who surrounded his fortress-like home in 2007 has objected to the process as double jeopardy. Edward Brown, 78, was sentenced to 37 years in prison after the monthslong standoff at his 100-acre property in Plainfield, New Hampshire. His wife, Elaine Brown, received a 35-year sentence, but a judge decided in January that she could be released after serving over 12 years in prison. She is seeking a divorce. Prosecutors recommended that Edward Brown, who served about the same amount of time, be resentenced to a term of 30 years to life in prison. His hearing is scheduled for March 24. “The defendant was the leader of a violent conspiracy designed to thwart the rule of law through threats and violence,\" U.S. Attorney Scott Murray said in court documents. “He threatened to kill law enforcement if they did their jobs and these were not merely empty threats. The defendant armed himself to the teeth and invited others to help him.\" The couple were holed up for nine months at their home after they stopped showing up in court for their trial on tax evasion charges. Anti-tax crusaders and out-of-state militia groups rallied to their cause. The Browns were arrested by U.S. marshals who posed as supporters and gained entry to their home. The marshals discovered weapons, explosives and booby traps. One charge against them, carrying and possessing a destructive device in connection with a crime of violence, carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 30 years. Their conviction on that charge was vacated in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that found the “crime of violence\" term unconstitutionally vague. Brown's lawyer argued in court papers that Brown completed his sentences on all of the other convictions....

 Bryant failed a field sobriety test and exceeded Florida's legal blood-alcohol level of .08, testing at levels of .102 and .99, police said. He was booked on a $500 bond. The Cowboys have not commented on the arrest.
 Undrafted out of Temple in 2019, Bryant joined the Cowboys' practice squad in September after being released by the Cincinnati Bengals. Promoted to the active roster on Oct. 2, he appeared in 12 games and registered six tackles on special teams. The 6-foot-3 wideout caught one pass, a 15-yard touchdown against the Buffalo Bills on Thanksgiving.

Those are adequate metrics for a computer at this price point, but they fall short for creative work. Colors generally looked good, with deep blacks making for a contrasty image.

We, because we’re using a very simplistic design, with hub motors, we are not changing the top of the truck too much. So we have a body-on-frame scenario and we really try not to reinvent anything that we don’t have to. So all the software is ours, of course, the chassis and the suspension are designed to handle, you know, the uniqueness of hub motors. But the simplicity of not having... there is not a gear in this vehicle. There’s not a drive shaft. There’s not an axle. There’s not a U joint. This is an extremely simple vehicle, even compared to a Tesla. So it is the simplest vehicle. If you’re going to have four wheels, you can’t do any simpler than only those four wheels are the only moving parts. And to have a computer basically precisely controlling each wheel suddenly get better traction than any pickup truck ever made, you’ve got better handling. Without a V8 up front, we intend to be the safest in the crash test of any pickup truck ever made.

A men's undergarment line, branded 'Valera', followed and grew into a success, ­despite V-Star's reputation as a women's lingerie maker. (Both lines have since been rebranded to V-Star.)

WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington health officials recommended on Wednesday that all “non-essential mass gatherings, including conferences and conventions,” be postponed or canceled through the end of March in light of the coronavirus outbreak, a move that could imperil the popular Cherry Blossom Festival. The announcement signals a major escalation in the District of Columbia's response to the spread of the virus. A brief statement from the District of Columbia Health Department did not mention the Cherry Blossom Festival, but it recommended that “any social, cultural, or entertainment events where large crowds are anticipated be reconsidered by the organizer” through March 31. It defined mass gatherings as “events where 1,000 or more people congregate in a specific location.” Officials have steadfastly refused to speculate on the fate of the Cherry Blossom Festival, which starts on March 20 and typically signals the beginning of Washington's tourist high season. Washington officials declined to comment beyond the statement, but Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser scheduled a briefing for later in the afternoon. Also Wednesday, Georgetown University joined the growing list of higher learning institutions to cancel in-person classes as fears of infection by the COVID-19 coronavirus continue to progressively warp daily life from coast to coast. A statement on the Georgetown website announced that the university is “suspending all in-person, on-campus classroom instruction” until further notice and would be “moving all classroom instruction for all of our schools to virtual learning environments.” The announcement came a day after American University in Washington made a similar move. As with American University, the Georgetown dorms will remain open, but...

It’s one of four companies in the running to build the United States Postal Service’s new generation of mail trucks, but its business has come to something of a standstill as it awaits the results of that bid. Instead, Workhorse’s founder and former CEO Steve Burns started a new company called Lordstown Motors, and _that_ company is what will build electric pickup trucks at the former GM factory.

PLYMOUTH - Plymouth South Athletic Director Scott Fry didn't have to look far to find his successor as head football coach. He was right there all along.
 Earlier this week veteran assistant coach Darren Fruzzetti was named the new head coach for the Panthers. A math teacher at Plymouth South, the 38-year-old Plymouth North and Stonehill College graduate has been on Fry's coaching staff for the last 12 seasons, first as a position coach and the last few years as the offensive coordinator after the retirement of Paul Coffin.
 "This is a great opportunity for me. I know it's a cliche but this really is my dream job," Fruzzetti said Tuesday night. "I want to keep the ball rolling on what Coach Fry has started. I expect to challenge for the league title each year and hopefully we can get some playoff victories along the way."
 Fry said the school received a dozen applications for the open coaching spot and three finalists were called in for an interview with Fruzzetti getting the nod. Fry stepped down in January after 16 years as head coach of the football program but remains as athletic director for the high school.
 "I think Darren will do really well as head coach," Fry said. "He's got a great relationship with the players and everything he does will be for the kids. He's smart and he's a very good communicator."
 Fruzzetti and Fry go way back. Fry was Fruzzetti's position coach when he was a three-year starter at middle linebacker for the Blue Eagles in the late 90's.
 "(Fry) took a chance on me when he made me a starter as a sophomore and I've never forgotten that," said Fruzzetti, who also played fullback on offense and was a baseball captain under Dwayne Follette at Plymouth North. "I've learned so much working on his coaching staff about the game of football and how to get the best out of your team."
 Fruzzetti said because he knows the program and he's in the high school every day, that will make his transition to head coach that much easier.
 "I would like to get the team together as soon as I can to talk with them. The good thing about this is the returning players already know what to expect from me and I think I have a good handle on what they can do. That should make the transition process flow along much smoother," said Fruzzetti, who is also an assistant coach with the winter and track teams and was an assistant varsity baseball coach for seven years.
 Fruzzetti said words of advice from coaching mentors such as Fry, Follette, Bill Burkhead, Kevin Cobban and Dave McCormack will help him immensely in his first journey as a head football coach.
 "I've learned so much from all of them and many more of my coaches over the years," Fruzzetti said. "I've been lucky to have a lot of great mentors around me."
 Fruzzetti's challenge will be different from what an average first-year football coach might face. Instead of trying to get the Panthers to the top of the mountain, his challenge will be finding a way to keep them there.
 Behind a great senior class of athletes and team leaders that kept everything on point from day one of practice to the Division 3 Super Bowl game, the Patriot League champions ended last year with a loss to Melrose at Gillette Stadium in the state title game.
 Now it's up to Fruzzetti to map out the plan to get Plymouth South back on the road to Foxborough.
 "I'm excited," Fruzzetti said. "How many new coaches get to start with an experienced 6-foot-6 quarterback like Hunter Dean with the arm and athleticism he has? And then there are guys like Jack Condon and Matt Mahoney who are ready to step in and make their mark."
