The game also explicitly does not divide quests into primary and secondary. Some are, of course, more tied-up to the main overall objectives than others. What it does have in the more conventional style of side-quests, are “mysteries” littered all over the map. Encounters which lead into you doing something basic, and mostly can be rapped up in less than 10-15 minutes. While a few of these help lighten up the experience a bit or leave you with a bitter-sweet feeling, unfortunately, most of them feel uninspired, predictable and way too easy.

QUINCY — Will Wolfe couldn’t escape pandemic purgatory.
 Although the Quincy University freshman guard has yet to test positive for COVID-19, his close proximity to those within the men’s basketball program led to a continuous string of days in quarantine. At last count, he’d been isolated more than 50 days since arriving on campus in August.
 “It may be more than 60 now that I think about it,” said Wolfe, tilting his head back and shaking it side-to-side in disbelief of what he’s encountered.
 Yet, there he was Saturday, setting up in the right corner and turning a pass from freshman point guard Jaylen Boyd into his first career 3-pointer.
 Wolfe and Boyd made their first career starts in the 88-74 loss to Lindenwood at Pepsi Arena, a sign they’ve overcome the delays brought on by the coronavirus and a glimpse of what to expect down the road. They are part of an eight-man freshman class filled with potential.
 The development of each player will come in stages, but Wolfe and Boyd are ready to contribute now and will see increased playing time and responsibility as they adjust to their roles.
 “I’m glad that my coach is trusting me more,” said Boyd, a St. Louis Ladue product who spent more than 25 days in quarantine this fall. “I feel like I’m good at running that position and that’s what I do. I’m glad my coach is trusting me and allowing me to play more minutes.”
 After Sunday’s performance, those minutes are earned.
 Going against Southern Illinois University’s salty backcourt in an exhibition game at the Banterra Center in Carbondale, Ill., Boyd led the Hawks with 13 points and three assists.
 He went 5 of 9 from the field and 3 of 3 from the line in 16 minutes and attacked off the dribble with purpose and poise.
 “I was just letting the game come to me and being patient with it,” Boyd said.
 That’s a mature approach QU coach Ryan Hellenthal appreciates.
 “He’s growing up really fast,” Hellenthal said. “His competitive spirit was very, very good. He brought some juice to us early, which we desperately need.”
 Boyd is able to do that now that he has his legs under him. Neither he nor Wolfe practiced until November – the first allowable day of practice for Division II programs was October 15 – and had to play catch-up in terms of understanding the offense and pace of play.
 “That was really putting me behind,” Boyd said. “I had to face a little adversity there and stay focused.”
 Wolfe breathed easier once he was released from quarantine.
 “After I got out of quarantine, it was nice to get back on the practice floor with my teammates,” said Wolfe, an Oswego (Ill.) East product. “Obviously, after being in quarantine for a month straight, my legs weren’t there. It was hard to get back into it. At this point, I almost feel like I’m back to where I was.”
 Wolfe played 26 minutes against Lindenwood, while Boyd played 28 and neither looked out of place in the starting lineup.
 “Honestly, I was nervous for a little bit,” Wolfe said. “Once you get on the floor, once the tip comes, you’re in the zone and you’ve got to play. At that point, I was into the game where you get unconscious and just play the game.”
 It’s only going to get easier, especially when the Hawks figure out how to win.
 “We’ll get to the point where we will finish possessions, which leads into finishing halves, which leads into finishing games,” Wolfe said. “It’s mental toughness.”
 He and Boyd developed that during pandemic purgatory and are better on the court because of it.
 “They’re giving us a lift and have done a great job of staying tough through it all,” Hellenthal said. “It’s the kind of toughness we need.”

Who wouldn’t pay student nurses?
 The lot of the student nurse reads like a scene from a horror film except that it’s a real daily occurrence, it’s unpaid, relentless and lasts for four years.
 It involves, inter alia, in dealing full time with pregnant women; cleaning up blood, faeces, vomit, and urine.
 Without even finishing their modules, the student nurses have to help deliver babies, have to carry out complex natal care on women who are high risk in their pregnancies, doing, for example, abdominal palpitations to feel the stomach to see which way the baby is lying.
 Or having to check for tears, and examine sutures, looking out for, and having to make personal assessments of, sepsis and other deteriorations.
 Giving injections and being left alone in a room with a woman who has a post partum haemorrhage — something no student nurse is yet trained to deal.
 Working 31 hours a week, 13 hour day shifts, 12 hour night shifts and half days for no remuneration whatsoever.
 Take the example of a student nurse who couldn’t risk losing her part-time job working as a waitress in a cafe because she needed to pay for her college fees and transport, so often times she would work a night shift in the Coombe from 8pm to 8am and then would have to go straight to her part time job and work a full day, without any sleep.
 What kind of a Government will vote down the plea of thousands of such heroic front line workers for a miserable pittance, while arguing for days over the appointment of a Supreme Court judge who is already handsomely paid, or scoring points and feigning outrage at the tweet of a fellow TD over something that happened 100 years ago.
 To paraphrase Shakespeare “do ye not have hearts of flesh at all, but rather hearts of stone?” If ever a case needed maximum attention from a complacent, unheeding Government it is this.
 Is it little wonder that the opposition — who universally supported the paying of student nurses — rise higher and higher in the polls in the light of such a blatant and specific Government injustice.

ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s governor is again telling lawmakers that he won’t call a special session to overturn Georgia’s election results and appoint 16 presidential electors who would support Republican President Donald Trump instead of Democratic President-elect Joe Biden.Republican Gov. Brian Kemp issued a joint statement Sunday with Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, saying it would violate state law for the General Assembly to name electors instead of following the current state law that calls for the governor to certify electors after results are certified.“Any attempt by the legislature to retroactively change that process for the Nov. 3rd election would be unconstitutional and immediately enjoined by the courts, resulting in a long legal dispute and no short-term resolution,” the two said in their statement.Trump and Kemp spoke by phone hours before Trump held a rally on Saturday in Valdosta. The president asked Kemp to order the legislative session and the governor refused. According to a tweet from the governor, Trump also asked him to order an audit of absentee ballots from the presidential race in his state. Kemp has said he can’t do that because he has no authority to interfere in the electoral process on Trump’s behalf.Trump on Sunday tweeted more unproved allegations that Georgia’s election was fraudulent, blaming Kemp and Duncan for inaction.“Has anyone informed the so- called (says he has no power to do anything!) Governor @BrianKempGA &amp; his puppet Lt. Governor @GeoffDuncanGA, that they could easily solve this mess, &amp; WIN. Signature verification &amp; call a Special Session. So easy!”Duncan and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger appeared on television Sunday to defend the integrity of the election.“I’m proud that we’re able to look up after three recounts and watch and be able to see that this election was fair,” Duncan said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Was it perfect? Absolutely not. I don’t know if any election was perfect in the history of this country.”“Right now, we don’t see anything that would overturn the will of the people here in Georgia,” Raffensperger said on ABC.Gabriel Sterling, who’s in charge of implementing Georgia’s voting system, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Trump is inciting unrest.“The president’s statements are false. They’re disinformation. They are stoking anger and fear among his supporters. And hell, I voted for him. The situation’s getting much worse and it’s an environment that’s been built out over years,” Sterling said.State lawmakers could call a special session on their own, but only if 60% of members in both houses of the General Assembly demanded a session in writing. That’s unlikely, especially because more than 40% of the current members of the state House are Democrats.On Saturday, four Republican state senators including William Ligon of Brunswick, Greg Dolezal of Cumming, Brandon Beach of Alpharetta and Burt Jones of Jackson launched a written petition trying to collect the signatures to force a special session. All four attended Trump’s rally Saturday in Valdosta.“I don’t believe that there’s the will in the General Assembly for a special session,” Raffensperger said. He said if lawmakers went ahead “they would be then nullifying the will of the people.”Kemp and Duncan said that going to court is “the only viable — and quickest option” for people challenging the results of Georgia’s presidential balloting.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Lionel Messi remains the best player in the world and deserves a big-money contract to reflect that, according to presidential candidate Joan Laporta, who has also backed under-fire head coach Ronald Koeman.
 The Argentina international was tipped to join Premier League side Manchester City, managed by former Barca boss Pep Guardiola, after handing in a transfer request following a tumultuous 2019-20 campaign.
 He opted to remain in Catalonia, where he has spent his entire career to date, but is out of contract in June and has since been linked with French champions Paris Saint-Germain and Italian giants Inter.
 Barcelona's interim president Carlos Tusquets last week made headlines by suggesting the club should have cashed in on Messi due to the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 But Laporta, who is in the running to succeed Josep Maria Bartomeu as Barca's next president in January's elections, has taken a different stance and believes Messi is worth every penny he is paid.
 "You could argue many reasons for him staying. I prefer to think about what Leo generates, which is a lot – certainly more than his salary may cost," Laporta told Sport. "I'm not just talking about the sporting level, which is already well known.
 "I consider him the best footballer in history. Leo is so much more than just that. In my opinion all players, when they win many titles and generate so much for the club, deserve to be valued accordingly.
 "At least that's how I'll try to make it happen. Leo is, I repeat, the best player in the world and possibly in the history of football. What you have to keep in mind is that he loves Barca and has shown that repeatedly.
 "He is a club man and is comfortable at Barcelona and in the city. That is another factor that leads us to think the best thing for us is for the Messi- Barcelona relationship to continue."
 However, reiterating comments he previously made, Laporta acknowledged it will take more than money to persuade six-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi to sign a contract extension at Camp Nou.
 "You have to be imaginative," he said. "Knowing Mess is not guided by money, and I assure you that is the case, we must make a proposal that can convince him Barca has a team capable of winning the Champions League.
 "That is essential. It is what will be more valuable to Leo when deciding his future at the end of the season. I am convinced of that.
 "Leo and I have a relationship of mutual affection. He knows that whenever I have made him a proposal, it has been fulfilled. Leo knows it and has told me personally he valued that very much. He should finish his career at Barca."
 Messi has scored four goals in 10 LaLiga appearances this season and seven in 13 overall, with Koeman leaving the forward out of the squad and his starting line-up on multiple occasions this term.
 Barca thrashed Dynamo Kiev 4-0 and Ferencvaros 3-0 in their last two games without Messi involved, though Laporta's fellow presidential candidate Victor Font insisted the 33-year-old's ability cannot be questioned.
 "It makes me suffer that there are some Barcelona fans who doubt Messi," he told El Iniestazo. "We have to appeal to justice and think about everything Messi has given us. If we stop and look back, we will never see him again.
 "You have to wonder how Messi is to not be at the club he loves the most. Some lose confidence in him but he does not deserve that. If I am named president then Messi will renew at the end of the season."
 The future of head coach Koeman has been another hot topic of debate at Camp Nou following Barca's worst start to a LaLiga campaign in 33 years in terms of points accrued after 10 matches.
 Koeman is already under increasing pressure, just four months after being named as Quique Setien's successor, but Laporta feels the legendary former player should be given time to get things right.
 "He deserves a margin of confidence, not only because of his wisdom at football level, but also because he is a great of Barca," Laporta said.
 "As part of the Dream Team, Ronald gave us good memories and his famous goal gave us our first Champions League. He knows what he's doing and you have to give him time.
 "He and I can see that the team is improving, but nothing has been achieved yet. I appreciate the courage when it comes to betting on younger players, and I see that the players are once again motivated.
 "He has had to deal with many delicate aspects since arriving. He is in the process of getting the team that he wants."

 The actor says he has realised how to use social media platforms wisely to help him connect with people in dire situations. Using the platform to reach out to people who otherwise won’t be able to get in touch with him, he is connected with over 2 lakh people resolving issues related to jobs, transportation and surgeries, adds Sonu. Going forward, the portal will upskill the candidates and train them to secure the job they wish to have.
 The actor says that balancing his film career with social work has been challenging but a blessed experience. “People gather around the set when I am filming and tell me their problems, I help them between shots,” says Sonu.
 Recently, during a shoot with Telugu superstar Chiranjeevi, the two actors joked about how fight scenes felt wrong because of Sonu’s off-screen persona — of a good samaritan. He recalls one such shoot where the director re-shot many scenes to invert his on-screen perception of a villain, to avoid backlash from the actor’s followers.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A proposed COVID-19 relief bill is expected to get backing from President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell but it won’t include $1,200 in direct payments to most Americans, a Republican senator involved in the bipartisan talks says.“President Trump has indicated that he would sign a $908 billion package — there’s only one $908 billion package out there and it’s ours,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Sunday. “The pain of the American people is driving this, and I’m optimistic that both those leaders will come on board.”With time running out, lawmakers from both parties were closing in on the final language that would provide roughly $300 in extra federal weekly unemployment benefits, leaving the issue of cash payments for President-elect Joe Biden to wrestle over with a new Congress next year.The package to be released Monday would be attached to a larger year-end spending bill needed to avert a government shutdown this coming weekend.The direct payments were popular when they were first distributed after the pandemic hit, and Biden on Friday had expressed hope that a second wave might come after weekend negotiations.But senators involved in the talks said the checks won’t be included as part of the compromise, even as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and others said that could cause them to oppose the measure.Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranking Democrat, indicated that excluding the checks while assuring small-business aid and renters’ assistance was the only way to reach agreement with Republicans who are putting firm limits on the bill’s final price tag.“The $1,200 check, it cost we believe nationally $300 billion, to give you an idea,” he said. “The Democrats have always wanted a larger number, but we were told we couldn’t get anything through the Republicans, except this $900 billion level.”The plan being worked on by a group of Republican and Democratic senators is less than half of the Democrats’ push of $2.2 trillion and nearly double the $500 billion “targeted” package proposed by McConnell, R-Ky.Cassidy agreed that a new round of direct checks “may be a go” at some point. “This is not a stimulus bill, it’s a relief bill,” he said. “And it’s something for the next three to four months to help those in greatest need.”The proposal is expected to include the $300 per week in bonus federal unemployment payments, providing relief just as emergency aid payments at regular benefit levels are set to expire at year’s end. It would extend a freeze on evictions for people who cannot pay their rent and reauthorize the Paycheck Protection Program to give a second round of subsidies to businesses struggling through the pandemic.Still, potential sticking points remain.Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said last week they wouldn’t support the $908 billion proposal if it did not include checks for families, and were joined by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are also against shielding businesses from lawsuits claiming negligence for COVID-19 outbreaks, a provision pushed by Republicans.While favoring the $1,200 checks, Biden said the emerging compromise was “immediately needed” and that additional assistance could follow later.On Sunday, lawmakers involved in the negotiations said the direct payments would have to wait until after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20. At that time, Biden will face a new Congress as vaccines are being distributed, with a narrowed Democratic majority in the House and a closely divided Senate potentially split 50-50 if Democrats are able to prevail in two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5.Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said Sanders was not involved in the negotiations and “his characterization is just not accurate” about the potential liability protections for businesses. The direct payments, he said, will be a task for Biden.Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said the bipartisan group was focused on extending the most urgent aid for the next four months.“Every indication says more money is needed; we see that,” he said. “This gets us through basically the lifelines that people need and the small businesses that can survive and not go under.”Manchin said Biden’s team, when in power, “can put together a different proposal that takes us further down the road for more recovery.”Durbin spoke on ABC’s “This Week,” Cassidy appeared on “Fox News Sunday,” Warner was on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Manchin was interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

South Africa's fuel prices are adjusted monthly, informed mostly by international oil costs and the exchange rate. In November, the rand appreciated against the dollar from 16.46 to 15.63. This is despite Brent crude increasing from $40.63 to $42.10 a barrel during the period under review. It was the highest price since March, mostly on the back of more positive news about Covid-19 vaccines, the department says in its official press announcement.

It is the only modern grain terminal in the country and handles around 2.5 MT of imports annually. These imports are expected to further grow in tandem with the demands of a large population. A large portion of these imports include Soybeans, which are crushed locally and have resulted in a large domestic oilseeds processing industry. It is therefore imperative that the port runs its operations as efficiently and effectively as possible. Through this partnership, Cargill brings its global experience in handling port operations and with Fauji Foundation aims to improve port efficiencies and modernize operations using learnings from ports around the world. This will also enable Fauji Foundation to build on its agricultural and infrastructure sector presence and help strengthen agri supply chain sector in Pakistan.

After all these years, as we are living through a pandemic yet again, there is a lot to learn from the bygone era. Regarding where we stand today in our everyday battle against COVID-19, Tumbe refers to what the Nobel-Prize winning scientist Joshua Lederberg had once said about how we have a good grip on handling bacterial infections, but still have a long way to go when it comes to understanding viruses. He agrees with Lederberg and says, Pandemics should be seen as a ‘natural evolutionary phenomenon’. One cannot eradicate pandemics; only curtail them.

Netflix's _The Crown_ is both steeped in real-world history and a sumptuous drama. It neither plucks its storylines out of thin air, nor retells events exactly as they were. At the end of it all, though, it's just a TV series.
 And that's why Netflix has resisted calls to include a so-called fiction disclaimer as part of the programme, insisting that _The Crown_ has "always" been presented as a drama that's broadly based on real events.
 Following the premiere of season four, which focuses largely on the relationship of Prince Charles and the late Diana Spencer, reports suggested that the show was influencing people's perception of the Royal Family.

Federer's highly publicized fall out with longtime sponsors, Nike heralded the start of a legal transfer of rights for the logo back over to Federer.
