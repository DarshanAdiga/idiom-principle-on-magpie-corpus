PEKIN -- Val Champagne played only one season for the Pekin girls soccer team, but she left a legacy.
   
 Champagne will attend the IMG Academy starting this school year. The junior is most likely the first central Illinois high school soccer player to play soccer for the prestigious boarding school, located on a 600-acre campus in Bradenton, Fla.
   
 Champagne will be getting a nearly daily dose of soccer at the IMG Academy, practicing or playing six days a week.
   
 "I always want to grow as a person and a soccer player. I certainly can do that at the IMG Academy, plus there will be great exposure to college soccer coaches, more than I would get at Pekin," she said.
   
 Champagne wasn't putting down Pekin when she made her comment about college recruiting. She was simply stating a fact.
   
 "It's so hard to leave Pekin," she said. "I have so many friends there and I can't say enough about the administrators and teachers. They let me miss about two weeks of school last year because of soccer. I am who I am today because of Pekin."
   
 Who is she?
   
 She's a personable 16-year-old who has as an equally strong work ethic in the classroom as she does on the soccer pitch. She had a 4.0 grade-point average through two school years at Pekin.
   
 "People may think the IMG Academy doesn't focus on academics because it's a school built for the student-athlete," she said. "It absolutely is focused academically. The academics are tough. There's a cap on the number of advanced placement courses you can take until you prove you can handle more."
   
 Pekin girls soccer coach Edgar Sandoval is confident Champagne can handle the academic and athletic rigors at the IMG Academy.
   
 "Val is a driven student and soccer player," Sandoval said. "Going to the IMG Academy is a wonderful opportunity for her to be challenged on many levels. We'll miss her, but she'll always have a lot of support here."
   
 This is a school year like no other because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Champagne has already felt the effects.
   
 She had to self-quarantine for seven days and take a COVID-19 test before heading to Florida last week.
   
 Her test was negative, but she was subjected to the 6-inch long nasopharyngeal swab at the now-shuttered Heartland Health Services testing site in Pekin.
   
 "I didn't know my nasal cavity was that long. It was a funny feeling having that swab up there," she said, making it clear she wasn't laughing during the test.
   
 Champagne said she originally was going to room at the IMG Academy with a golfer, but that was switched to a U17 soccer player like herself.
   
 Soccer players have been placed in 12-player pods. Those players will practice together and keep the same schedule.
   
 Champagne's sophomore season at Pekin this spring was canceled because of the pandemic. She played for the Dragons as a freshman in 2019.
   
 "I was very upset when the season was canceled, but I quickly realized it was done to keep everyone safe," she said.
   
 Losing the season at Pekin didn't play a role in her decision to attend the IMG Academy.
   
 "Not at all," she said. "I was contacted by email in March by the IMG Academy, and my parents and I didn't make the decision for me to go there until June."
   
 Champagne is a 5-foot-5 defender whose favorite position is outside back.
   
 "I like to run all over the field," she said. "It's second nature to me."
   
 Sandoval said during Champagne's lone season with Pekin, "she was fearless. She was a strong defender with an attacking mentality. She wasn't afraid to make one, two or three plays and make a long run with the ball."
   
 Had Pekin played this spring, Sandoval said, Champagne would have seen action at center back, center midfield and forward.
   
 Sandoval also coached Champagne on the Pekin Pride girls U8 club team.
   
 "You could tell back then that Val was athletic and had a lot of potential," Sandoval said. "She was all in. A real soccer kid."
   
 Champagne's soccer resume outside of Pekin includes playing on the U.S. Youth Soccer Midwest Region Olympic Development Program girls 2004 team and the Illinois Youth Soccer ODP state girls 2004 team.
   
 Champagne attended St. Joseph Catholic School in Pekin through eighth grade.
   
 Her parents are Ron Champagne and Nani Moazzam and she has a brother, 12-year- old Bijan. Her father is a pathologist and her mother is a general surgeon. Val is thinking of becoming a dermatologist.

Nearby, in a cavernous barn filled with bellowing cattle and giant fans keeping them cool, 18-year-old Antonio Treto Alvarez was cleaning out the hooves of his final 4-H steer.
 "He weighs as much as a truck!" Treto declared, adding that he thought the big, nameless guy would go far in his competition. It would be a good end to Treto's 11 years in 4-H, starting with lambs.
 "I've probably hand-raised more sheep than math assignments I've turned in," he said, with a smirk.
 All around him was that earthy, pungent smell of manure. Treto called it "homey," though he could bet some folks might think that was weird.
 "There's people out and about. They're taking care of their animals. They're getting stuff done," he said. "It's a nice feeling, and it's a nice smell."
 It was a whiff of something normal, in a time so alien.

 WICHITA-It has been a good summer for outdoor entertainment, with social distancing recommendations due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Kansas bikers are fortunate to have several trail options for exploration at their tire- tips.
 One of these is the Prairie Sunset Trail near Wichita. This trail is a relatively easy ride (bike, walk or horseback ride, all of which are allowed) for most members of the family. Like other trails carved from abandoned rail lines, there is little elevation gain. And, if one sticks to the portion of the trail west of Maize Road, it's virtually impossible to get lost, since the Prairie Sunset Trail is a straight out and back experience.
 If one should choose to complete the section from Maize to South Hoover Road, where the trail ends, it pays to study satellite imagery, which is readily available online. It's easy to miss a turn on this more urban section.
 Th Prairie Sunset Trail has advantages for the Kansas cyclist. A good chunk of it is lined with trees on both the north and south sides. Subsequently, if it's a blustery winter day or an unruly summer one, a shelterbelt provides protection for most of the journey.
 Conversely, this can be a disadvantage on an especially hot summer day, when the wind isn't quite strong enough to push through the trees. However, another advantage of this trail is being able to ride in Kansas' largest city without much concern about traffic--only every mile or so when the trail crosses a road.
 There are several highlights along the way, one being the Goddard Linear Park. This trail stop features a bike tool and air pump station. There are also restrooms and a water fountain available here. On a hot summer day, the water playground just south of the trail issues an enticing invitation.
 Another highlight of this bicycle trail is the covered bridge on the section of trail just east of Garden Plain. It's definitely worth a stop and a photograph.
 The Prairie Sunset Trail can be accessed at virtually any point where it intersects roads between Garden Plain and Hoover Road in Wichita. However, some of the specific trailheads, where parking is accommodated, include: Garden Plain Park at 620 Section Line Road; Goddard Linear Park at 108 N. Main Street; and the cul-de-sac at 1600 S.111 th St. in Wichita.

Following Tuesday's primary election, Don Schroeder of Hesston will return to an elected position. The former Kansas House representative will become a county commissioner.
   
 Schroeder won a three-way race in the primary for the Harvey County Commission District 3 nomination. He will be unopposed in the general election.
   
 The commission seat will be vacated by Ron Krehbiel of Burrton, who announced his retirement from the board after 20 years on the commission earlier this year.
   
 "It feels good. It was a lot of work to do. I am not afraid of that," Schroeder said. "It will be big shoes to fill, and I have known him for a long time. I will do my best."
   
 Schroeder served about 10 years in the Kansas Legislature before losing a primary election in 2018 to Stephen Owens (R-Hesston). Schroeder has also served on a school board and the McPherson County Commission.
   
 Of note are write-ins for the Harvey County Commission District 2, where there were write-in votes to tabulate. Democrat Christy Schunn received 684 of 706 write-in votes, exceeding the amount needed to achieve the Democratic nomination. Schunn ran a write-in campaign in an attempt to appear on the ballot to face incumbent Randy Hague in the November general election. Schunn needed about 400 write-ins to appear on the November ballot.
   
 In another hotly contested local race, political newcomer Avery Anderson (R-Newton) pulled 38.01% of the vote to take a lead over Newton City Commissioner Kathy Valentine, R-Newton, 523-487, in the Kansas House District 72 race. Also in that race were Lance Gormley (193, or 14%) and Dwight McAdow (173, or 12.57%). Anderson will face incumbent Tim Hodge, D-North Newton, for the seat in the November general election.
   
 For federal seats, Harvey County mirrored the state in the Republican U.S. Senate race, giving U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall the win over Kris Kobach. The race saw 11 candidates vying for the nomination. Kansas Sen. Barbara Bollier won the Democratic nomination.
   
 There were 4,073 ballots cast during the primary election out of 22,882 registered voters.

Ali Lozano, the voting rights outreach coordinator for the Texas Civil Rights Project, says local officials have to plan for a lot more ahead of this particular election.
 "It's of the utmost importance that election administrators and county officials start preparing now," she says, "to make sure that we have enough polling locations, enough poll workers and that everybody knows what they need to be doing in order to make everyone feel safe."
 In Austin, Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir is among the 254 local officials searching for safe in-person voting sites. She said she plans to have about 35 early voting centers and 200 Election Day voting sites.
 So far, DeBeauvoir says, finding locations for those sites has been a challenge.
 "A lot of the owners of the facilities we want won't give us an answer for sure one way or another that we can or cannot use the facility," she says.
 Some locations are completely off the table. The state has advised against the use of nursing homes and senior centers and suggests moving to larger venues when possible.
 For example, polling sites at grocery stores were super-popular in Austin because they were so convenient. But now, DeBeauvoir says, the pandemic has made grocery stores a terrible idea.
 "There's no way to socially distance the voters, especially from the shoppers," she says. "And it was just too close, too crowded. It was never going to work."
 During this last election, DeBeauvoir says, she relied heavily on schools. Now that schools may be reopening at some point in the fall, though, it's up in the air.
 Chris Davis, the elections administrator for Williamson County, in Central Texas, says polling places that primarily serve older voters are also a bad idea these days.
 "We are relatively certain we are going to take off the table nursing homes and assisted living that we have used and enjoyed — and the residents had enjoyed in the past — as Election Day polling places," he says.
 To replace these former sites, election officials are going to have to get creative, Davis says.
 "It's not going to be uniform from one county to another," he says.
 For example, Davis is looking for open-air options in an effort to keep the possible spread of the coronavirus down.
 "We are considering sites that we can have kind of a robust drive-through voting," he says, "[maybe] a defunct or closed bank with several teller lanes ... perhaps parking garages. Something that can give one-stop service."
 DeBeauvoir says she's looking at setting up polling stations in lobbies, hotel ballrooms and amenity centers at apartment complexes.
 Where these new polling sites are located matters too.
 Pérez says election officials also have to be mindful of how voting locations are distributed within their counties.
 "They need to make sure that there's enough polling places in the communities that need them," she says, "especially in communities that are underserved or have low rates of vote-by-mail usage."
 Voting rights groups worry that not having enough polling sites could lead to longer lines during the upcoming election.
 Texas has roughly 750 fewer polling sites than it did about a decade ago, so Lozano says many counties are already at risk.
 Plus, voting during the pandemic is going to take longer than it did in 2016 because of added safety measures.
 "And that's if people keep the same amount of polling locations," Lozano says. "If we have even less polling locations with these added steps, it's just a perfect storm for problems that is absolutely going to lead to longer lines if we do not substantively prepare now."

PEORIA -- It's a mixed bag when it comes to the daily report of COVID-19 numbers for the Tri-County Area.
   
 Cases continue to go up. The area reported an additional 127 cases on Wednesday, for a grand total of 1,991 since the pandemic began. And seven more hospital beds at the area's four hospitals are in use compared with the numbers for Tuesday.
   
 In all, there are 49 people in the hospital, in both ICU and non-ICU beds, for COVID-19 symptoms.
      
 But on the other hand, more people are listed as having "recovered." The area's health departments report 64% of the people infected with the novel coronavirus have recovered, up from 60.9% from Tuesday.
   
 And the rate of hospitalization fell slightly from 2% of all positive cases to 1.7%.
   
 There were no new deaths reported, leaving the area's total since March at 43.
   
 Peoria County, with the largest population, saw the largest increase, 80, bringing its pandemic total to 1,432. Tazewell's total rose 32 to 436 positive tests, while Woodford County was up 15 to a total of 123 positive tests.

The Working Families Party, a New York-based progressive organization with growing national influence, will endorse and put resources behind Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey's re-election campaign and Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse's bid to unseat a 30-year incumbent in the state's 1st Congressional District.
 The double-endorsement, of a sitting senator and an insurgent House candidate, signals both the success of the progressive movement over the past few years and a new charge to defend lawmakers, like Markey, who have embraced the left's agenda and led the way in pushing it forward on Capitol Hill. The Working Families Party's independent expenditure group was among those that backed Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib against a moderate primary challenge in Michigan's 13th District this week, a race she comfortably won on Tuesday night.
 Morse is challenging Rep. Richard Neal, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has come under fire from the left -- and other more moderate factions of the party -- for not pursuing oversight efforts into President Donald Trump and his administration with sufficient urgency. The 31-year-old, four-term mayor's campaign is also backed by Justice Democrats, the group that helped launch a series of successful progressive challengers, from New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2018, to 2020 primary winners Jamaal Bowman in New York and Cori Bush in Missouri.

He was also to spread the rumour that the Pope had sent for them ‘so that no one may know or suspect that the Earls have gone to Rome on my order’. The ambassador reported that the Pope had replied that ‘he would honour and favour them as much as he could’ but thought he would give them nothing or very little because ‘the apostolic treasury is very low and His Holiness is not very liberal’. The Pope was not prepared to state that he had sent for them but that they were coming of their own accord to seek refuge with him. From London the Spanish ambassador wrote:

One of the blights of building a security practice is getting all of your technologies to integrate together and feed information to each other. When you add the fact that each technology has its own user interface (UI) and management console, it can very quickly become overwhelming for the end user to keep tabs on each console, learn every interface and complicates building a workflow in the case of incidents or investigations. The administrators who manage the system also have to update each component individually, ensure that the integrations don't break when an update is delivered and ensure that any new technologies don't cause an existing piece of your solution to fail.

Southeast Los Angeles County has become the epicenter for the resurgence of the coronavirus, according to a Times analysis of county health data that found infections skyrocketing in its mostly working-class Latino communities.
 The sharp increase since the economy reopened around Memorial Day shows the virus is spreading rapidly through factories, stores and other workplaces and into communities with higher rates of poverty, more crowding and many essential workers who make the economy tick. Hit hard by job losses during the shutdown, they are increasingly suffering from the virus itself.
 The region reported more than 27,000 new COVID-19 cases over the last two months, the most in the county. The area now accounts for 19% of new infections, although it comprises just 12% of the countywide population, the Times analysis shows. That vaulted its once-modest infection rate into one of the highest in the county, and just below the already hard-hit Eastside and South L.A. areas, according to the Times analysis through Aug. 2
 The trend is part of a statewide spike in infections among Latinos, both in rural, farm-working communities and urban areas. It’s only the latest burden for a corner of Southern California long beset by pollution from nearby industry, a lack of access to healthcare and a host of other ills.

PEORIA -- If a restaurant employee tests positive for COVID-19, that doesn't in and of itself mandate an eatery closure or even public notification, local health departments confirmed Tuesday.
   
 It does, however, set the stage for cleaning the restaurant.
   
 Those clarifications come in the wake of several restaurants in recent days across the Peoria region that have elected to close or tell members of the public about positive employee tests while cleaning is being carried out.
   
 Health departments are kept in the loop about positive tests in their area through results coming from testing sites.
   
 "That triggers our contact tracing," Peoria City/County Health Department spokeswoman Diana Scott said.
   
 And that tracing of "anyone they have been in close contact within 6 feet for more than 15 minutes," results in contacts to those people from the Health Department, Scott said.
   
 That can include notifying employers like restaurants.
   
 The state's Department of Public Health website contains guidance for cleaning in those instances. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has basic practices for disinfecting facilities that has been shared with restaurants, Tazewell County Health Department spokeswoman Sara Sparkman said. They've also received a set of CDC recommendations on reopening after multi- day closures.
   
 The county health department monitors all instances considered outbreaks -- where there are two or more cases considered to be linked -- Sparkman said.
   
 So long as an employee abides by quarantine or isolation guidelines, "there is usually not a need to shut down any establishment," Scott said, adding that contact-tracers help restaurants and other facilities with that guidance.
   
 However, "if there is an outbreak of multiple cases associated with an establishment, notification to the public may be warranted," she said.

EAST PEORIA -- Thanks to the White Trash Bash, the Peoria area hasn't just made national news.
   
 It's made international news.
   
 Super.
   
 Mind you, I generally don't get worked up about what outsiders think of us. Still, it's worth noting that these reports paint us as self-centered, short- sighted, careless, backwater hicks.
   
 Obviously, that's not a good thing. But it's not the worst thing.
   
 The worst thing is that this event stains Greater Peoria's reputation as a caring community. Despite Peoria's ebb and flow of problems, it's always been a place that comes together during tough times. If folks need support -- financial, emotional, otherwise -- Peorians have never hesitated to rally together and lift others up.
   
 But now? During a pandemic? The White Trash Bash instead brazenly screams, "Get lost. It's all about me and my fun." Who wants to think about masks, ventilators and shutdowns when there are all of these boats, bikinis and beers? Hells, yeah!
   
 So, in an annual ritual in a cove of the Illinois River, hundreds of boats and partiers crowded together Saturday to blow it out. The organizer pooh-poohed worldwide coronavirus concerns, saying, "I believe the COVID tests and the numbers are irrationally inflated and the actual mortality rate is very low."
   
 Along with that assertion, he has yet to share his credentials as a medical professional or infectious-disease expert. But that's America today. Science and facts (like 700,000 deaths worldwide) are now something you "believe" or not.
   
 In that way, many naysayers scoff at risk. It's now a right to court disease. For the White Trashers, perhaps the theme was, "It's my party and I'll die if I want to."
   
 Of course, that disregards the notion that en route to sickness or death, they could infect others. But that seems to be of little concern anywhere, anymore.
   
 And this sad dynamic goes beyond a virus. It shows a cultural transformation toward self.
   
 In today's America, it's not typical or fashionable to think about others, including what our decisions and actions might say to anyone else. Certainly, this country long has been known for rugged individualism. But at least we carried an underlying sense of compassion.
   
 Today? Showing concern is akin to showing weakness. Instead, do and say what you want, regardless of others, at all times. That's how America rolls these days, according to the chest-puffed loudmouths. Behaving like a spoiled and self-centered 14-year-old is upheld as a twisted virtue, as if it's some sort of deranged social or political movement.
   
 To be clear, the organizer said the White Trashers have no political agenda: "This was a theme party. Some people were wearing mullets, some had Confederate flags."
   
 What fun, eh? Apparently, it's not a party without rebel flags, touting a failed and racist would-be country of traitors. That's a party "theme"? And during a period of civil-rights upheaval and (maybe) reform? I never realized symbols of slavery and subjugation could be considered a hoot.
   
 It's just another part of the overall we-don't-care message as the White Trash Bash gleefully shrieks, "It's all about me!" Meanwhile, some area residents feel their hearts skip a beat as they do everything they can to avoid catching the disease or transmitting it to others, and while some worry about virus- stricken friends and relatives and mourn the loss of COVID-killed loved ones.
   
 Right now, knee-jerk reactionaries are frothing and sputtering, "What about demonstrations? What about no masks there?" Indeed, that's a health concern as well. But that doesn't justify the White Trash Bash or other ego-driven behavior.
   
 To be sure, life does not grind to a halt during a pandemic. We go to work and we visit with others. With precautions, we might even go out to eat and have a beer.
   
 But throwing all caution to the wind? And throwing a White Trash Bash? And throwing it in people's faces?
   
 That's not a party. That's not patriotic. That's just pathetic.

This is not actor James D'Arcy's first encounter with writing and directing a film. He had that experience a few years ago with an oddball comic short titled "Chicken/Egg," which starred Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, then in his sixth season as Jamie Lannister on "Game of Thrones" (the short is currently available on YouTube). D'Arcy, making his name as a quiet, but dashing screen presence since the late-1990s, had been writing feature scripts for years, and came close to directing one of them, but "Made in Italy" was the first to have all of its pieces fall into place.      And his feature debut behind the camera is a rarity - a sweet and funny and charming and very positive movie that's not filled with cliches. His story teeters close to the edge of a couple of them, but never falls into the abyss.      With a small cast of mostly likable characters, and a scattering of good-for- nothings to make the nice folks look even better, D'Arcy's story introduces Jack (Micheal Richardson), the manager of a London art gallery, and his soon- to-be ex-wife Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) - one of the nasty characters - whose family owns the gallery and is now selling it, leaving Jack out in the cold.      What's a gallery manager who is going through a messy divorce, has no other career skills, has been sad and lost since his mother died in an accident when he was 7, and has no relationship, beyond an estranged one, with his aloof father, to do?      Well, look up dad, take a drive with him to their abandoned old family home in gorgeous Tuscany, sell the place, and have enough money to buy the gallery from his wife's family, of course!      You might wonder if the uncomfortable presence between the father and the son will somehow work out, or if the bitterness emanating from the son's bad marriage will lead to some kind of happiness for him, or if the mission to Italy will result in dreams coming true back home. Those are common and expected story arcs in small, arty films like this.      But "Made in Italy" depends as much on characters and their development as it does in the stories going on around them. It was a spot-on decision to have son Jack and father Robert be played by real-life son and father Micheal Richardson and Liam Neeson. It's not that there's that much of a physical similarity, but it clearly comes across that these two men know and understand each other, and everything clicks when they step into character, even when their roles call for two people who do not know each other very well. That's called good acting.      Their arrival in the little Tuscan village where the house has been empty for 20 years signals that it's time to introduce some comedy - Richardson proves to be adept at pratfalls - and some other characters - it's not long before we meet beautiful restaurant owner Natalia (Valeria Bilello) and business-minded estate agent Kate (Lindsay Duncan), along with a few assorted and rather colorful local characters.      In short order, the plotlines kick in: Do we fix up this dust heap or do we sell it as is? Or do we keep it? Arguments between father and son on those topics ensue. Is Jack getting a little crush on Natalia, even though she has a daughter with her and an ex-husband nearby? Can Robert, once a well-known painter who walked away from it all, ever come back to the limelight?      And then the father-son problems are plopped down in the middle of it all. Did supposedly carefree Robert abandon Jack when his wife died? Will sullen Jack ever figure out a way to get back with his dad? More important, does he even want to?      Amidst regular doses of drama and goofiness, all played out at a slow, smooth pace, with gentle music pushing it along, "Made in Italy" emerges as a story about unhappy people in a beautiful place, and how they're affected by it. There are misunderstandings and there are squabbles, and there's an enjoyable and impossibly happy ending. And even that doesn't feel like a cliche.      "Made in Italy" opens in select theaters and will be available on most VOD and cable platforms on Aug. 7.      Ed Symkus can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Made in Italy"   Written and directed by James D'Arcy   With Liam Neeson, Micheal Richardson, Valeria Bilello, Lindsay Duncan   Rated R

WICHITA-It has been a good summer for outdoor entertainment, with social distancing recommendations due to the coronavirus pandemic, and Kansas bikers are fortunate to have several trail options for exploration at their tire- tips.
   
 One of these is the Prairie Sunset Trail near Wichita. This trail is a relatively easy ride (bike, walk or horseback ride, all of which are allowed) for most members of the family. Like other trails carved from abandoned rail lines, there is little elevation gain. And, if one sticks to the portion of the trail west of Maize Road, it's virtually impossible to get lost, since the Prairie Sunset Trail is a straight out and back experience.
   
 If one should choose to complete the section from Maize to South Hoover Road, where the trail ends, it pays to study satellite imagery, which is readily available online. It's easy to miss a turn on this more urban section.
   
 Th Prairie Sunset Trail has advantages for the Kansas cyclist. A good chunk of it is lined with trees on both the north and south sides. Subsequently, if it's a blustery winter day or an unruly summer one, a shelterbelt provides protection for most of the journey.
   
 Conversely, this can be a disadvantage on an especially hot summer day, when the wind isn't quite strong enough to push through the trees. However, another advantage of this trail is being able to ride in Kansas' largest city without much concern about traffic--only every mile or so when the trail crosses a road.
   
 There are several highlights along the way, one being the Goddard Linear Park. This trail stop features a bike tool and air pump station. There are also restrooms and a water fountain available here. On a hot summer day, the water playground just south of the trail issues an enticing invitation.
   
 Another highlight of this bicycle trail is the covered bridge on the section of trail just east of Garden Plain. It's definitely worth a stop and a photograph.
   
 The Prairie Sunset Trail can be accessed at virtually any point where it intersects roads between Garden Plain and Hoover Road in Wichita. However, some of the specific trailheads, where parking is accommodated, include: Garden Plain Park at 620 Section Line Road; Goddard Linear Park at 108 N. Main Street; and the cul-de-sac at 1600 S.111 th St. in Wichita.

It is rare that Kansans will root for Missouri in anything.
   
 But Tuesday night, residents who have been pushing for the state to expand its KanCare program found themselves in just that position as they watched voters in the Show-Me State narrowly approve their own Medicaid expansion via ballot referendum.
   
 Since her inauguration, Gov. Laura Kelly has been a staunch supporter of Medicaid expansion, with the federal government offering to cover 90% of the costs of growing KanCare to cover over 130,000 low-income Kansans under provisions in the Affordable Care Act.
   
 But a deal reached with legislative Republicans to authorize such a move fell apart in the waning days of the 2020 session, despite the support of Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, R-Overland Park.
   
 More conservative members, including Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, wanted to tie an anti-abortion constitutional amendment to the expansion, while others feared the move would prove too costly if federal funding dissipated.
   
 The referendum in Missouri, which was approved by voters by a slim margin, could provide a renewed source of energy for expansion advocates, who are expected to renew their push again next session.
   
 Kelly wasted little time in putting out a statement praising the results in Missouri and urging her counterparts in the Legislature to work with her to follow suit.
   
 "Every single Kansas voter must ask themselves why, year after year, Republican leadership in the Legislature has blocked expansion," she said.
   
 Each of Kansas' neighbors has now moved to expand Medicaid, and April Holman, executive director for the pro-expansion group Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, said that could have a negative effect on attracting and retaining doctors in border areas unless Kansas follows suit.
   
 And no citizen-initiated ballot referendum process is available in the state, meaning the exact duplication of the path to expansion in Missouri, as well as Nebraska and Oklahoma, is impossible for advocates.
   
 Still, Holman said the results jibed with consistent polling in Kansas that Medicaid expansion is popular, pointing to a December poll from Fort Hays State University showing that 62% of Kansans surveyed would welcome the move.
   
 "We feel like what has played out in our neighboring states really just underscores that support," she said.
   
 But as votes were being counted in Missouri, a slate of primaries in the Kansas Legislature could upend the odds of getting expansion across the finish line next session.
   
 Six incumbent Republican senators who supported Medicaid expansion previously fell to more conservative opponents in primaries Tuesday. And one of the House's most moderate members, Rep. Jan Kessinger, R-Overland Park, lost in similar fashion.
   
 Those conservative challengers all have said they oppose Medicaid expansion, framing it as a potentially disastrous budget item in a time when the state is staring down the barrel of a COVID-19-induced shortfall.
   
 "When I talk about Medicaid, I know it from the inside out, not from the outside in," said Hutchinson doctor Mark Steffen, who defeated incumbent Sen. Ed Berger, R-Hutchinson, to earn the Republican nomination in the 34th Senate District. "It's an Obamacare relic. It was never designed to do any more than put more people on socialized medicine."
   
 In some of those districts, primarily in the Kansas City suburbs, that could be welcome news for Democrats who see an opportunity to pick up some more seats, particularly in the Senate.
   
 But the departure of more moderate members who came about as part of backlash to then-Gov. Sam Brownback in 2016 is likely to swing the makeup of the caucuses significantly, according to Patrick Miller, associate professor of political science at the University of Kansas.
   
 That could have an effect on a wide range of issues, especially given that new leaders will need to be tapped to replace both Wagle and Demming, who are both outgoing.
   
 More conservative members would be more liable to pick more conservative leaders, which could create a more polarized environment that could hinder the ability for Medicaid expansion to get off the ground next session.
   
 "On issues like Medicaid expansion or taxes or education the Legislature could get more polarized and actually net more conservative, even if Democrats are gaining seats because you have these moderates wiped out," Miller said.
   
 Holman acknowledged the primary elections were a setback for her organization's hopes. But she also argued that Medicaid was a more complicated issue than what is often displayed on the campaign trail.
   
 That means she believes lawmakers could still be swayed into making a deal -- albeit one that could look quite different than what was agreed to last session.
   
 "Pressure from the communities, from health care providers and hospitals and physicians and business groups ... that is still going to be there, whether an elected official is a conservative or a moderate or a Democrat," she said. "I think it comes back to making that case and helping the lawmakers to understand all the benefits that would come to their communities and their constituents if we were to expand Medicaid."

So far, Congress has seen about 100 cases among its members and workers, including more than a dozen lawmakers. And last month, Florida Republican Rep. Vern Buchanan said his longtime staffer, Gary Tibbetts, had succumbed to the illness.
 Davis, a key advocate who has called for widespread COVID-19 testing on Capitol Hill, said on Wednesday he sought a test after noticing he had a slightly elevated temperature. His wife, a cancer survivor, and staff, have since tested negative.
 "My staff and I take COVID-19 very seriously. My wife is a nurse and a cancer survivor, which puts her in an at-risk category like so many Americans," Davis said. "My office and I have always followed and will continue to follow CDC guidelines, use social distancing, and wear masks or face coverings when social distancing cannot be maintained."
 Grijalva himself tested positive last Friday, just days after Gohmert, a member of his Natural Resources committee did as well. A White House screening caught Gohmert's diagnosis a week ago Wednesday — a day after he sat by Grijalva during a committee hearing.
 Gohmert, who has been known to dismiss masks and other precautions for the pandemic, returned to his Capitol office after his test. He was attempting to travel with President Trump for a trip to Texas, but that was cancelled as a result.
 The Capitol's Office of the Attending Physician, a small, on-campus doctor's office, has advised a series of precautions for members and workers, including mask wearing and social distancing. However, in light of Gohmert's case, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi instituted a new mask mandate that will allow the forcible removal of a member by U.S. Capitol Police if they don't comply.
 Pelosi says the Capitol still isn't in a position to institute widespread testing because there's still equipment shortages making it difficult to test its more than 500 lawmakers and workforce of 20,000. Those that do have widespread testing programs in place, such as pro sports organizations, face their own controversy for gaining access. Some experts including Jha say national testing levels of about 5 million tests per week now should be closer to 30 million.
 "There are many people in the country who should be tested, should have access in order to quantify the problem, but also to trace and to treat so that people don't die," Pelosi recently told reporters. "And I don't think it's a good idea for members of the Congress to say, 'we should have it but maybe not necessarily the people who work here at the expense of others.'"
 In May, Pelosi and the Senate's top Republican, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, issued a joint statement turning down the Trump administration's one-time offer of 1,000 Abbott Laboratories rapid tests --- which was considered a small drop in the bucket, many say. At the time, Pelosi and McConnell said Congress shouldn't cut ahead of frontline workers and others in dire need of tests, which were more scarce at the time.
 Also, the Abbott tests remain a challenge to scale up for larger workforces like the Capitol and are more suitable for smaller groups such as the White House, experts say.
 However, Jha says Congress should instead be testing its members and employees weekly or more through other options.
 "If they don't, to me, that, to be perfectly honest, is a travesty," Jha says.
 Jha said the Capitol could use newer, so-called antigen tests. Preferably, about 6,000 could be tested daily, since antigen tests are more accessible today, can be scaled for larger workforces and can provide results within minutes.
 Such antigen tests have lower sensitivity levels than the more traditional polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests, Jha notes. However, when used regularly and frequently to test a certain population, there's better odds of catching an active case, he argues. In some cases, PCR tests, while more accurate, can also face longer delays for results.
 A congressional aide told NPR that by this summer, the Capitol's Office of the Attending Physician could only conduct about a dozen or so PCR tests a week. And that falls woefully short of the Capitol's needs, experts argue.
 In May, House Republicans, led in part by Davis, also pitched another plan to partner with the military to test about 6,000 or so a week on Capitol Hill. But that also may not be enough, experts say.
 However, Jha says a larger testing plan is also a matter of prioritizing Congress. With national tests at a higher level now than just a few months ago, the Capitol is in a better position to install such a program, Jha argues.
 "I just think Congress needs to be a priority," he said. "A lot of older members, it's high risk and, also, they are the U.S. Congress. This is a really important moment for Congress to be able to be protected."
 When Grijalva first learned of his results, he admits he was angry, and then asked questions of "why me?" And while he says he can't blame Gohmert directly, he is sure he caught the illness at the Capitol.
 "I've been doing everything right. I got masks, I got shields, I got gloves, which goes to the point of how insidious this this virus is," Grijalva said.
 The father of three daughters, and grandfather to five children, says his family reacted with their own fear — and anger. From Arizona, his family has sent him a round of herbal treatments, vitamins, a new thermometer and a blood oxygen sensor.
 And they're checking on him frequently.
 "I said, 'I'm not supposed to stress. Quit calling me every 20 minutes,'" he says laughingly.
 But he says he is continuing to do well. And he's hoping he clears this week without symptoms, which he was told is the critical window to escape any serious concerns of the illness.
 Meanwhile, he's re-learning a lesson, and he hopes any of his colleagues like Gohmert, who have at times dismissed precautions, will as well.
 "This pandemic doesn't care what your party affiliation or your political ideology might be," Grijalva said. "It does not care."

_Hunters_ has its merits – a few characters are deeply endearing and the performances (particularly Lerman’s in the lead) are compelling. But some of the content is extremely disturbing, inappropriate and should never have made it to the screen. Watching Nazis get killed in various ways is entertaining – and that I have no issue with – but the show often invents things which never happened for the purposes of entertainment. The most obvious and controversial example is a sequence involving a game of human chess, where Jewish prisoners at the concentration camp take the place of pieces and have to shoot each other once captured. The scene was rightly lambasted by the Auschwitz Museum, who said: “Inventing a fake game of human chess for @huntersonprime is not only dangerous foolishness & caricature. It also welcomes future deniers.” Then there were other scenes – such as Jews gassing Nazis – which were condemned by Stephen Smith, head of the USC Shoah Foundation Institution. “Jews never gassed Nazis. Period," he said. That I must even make this point is proof enough how perilous this slippery slope can become… By blurring the line between fact and fiction, _Hunters_ muddies the historical record, disrespects those who perished, and provides ammunition to those who seek to deny the truth of the Holocaust.”

“This year, we collectively won this league title, but I have surely had the worst season of my career individually,” he lamented.
 The Belgian winger arrived overweight after a summer of celebration and then suffered a hamstring injury on the eve of La Liga starting. It foreshadowed a troubled campaign where just as he seemed to be finding form, he was stricken again with a hairline fracture in his foot.
 Hazard has not played a full 90 minutes since November last year, and only the coronavirus pandemic gave him the chance to feature in the endgame of the season for Real Madrid.
 Just as well, because Zinedine Zidane’s side need Hazard to produce something special if they are to overturn their last 16 first-leg defeat by Manchester City in the Champions League, and go on to record a fourth triumph in five years in the competition.
 Pep Guardiola’s men came from behind to earn a 2-1 win at Santiago Bernabeu back in February as Madrid captain Sergio Ramos was sent off, leaving the Premier League runners-up firm favourites for the second leg.
 But Hazard is the type of player capable of tilting the balance in Madrid’s favour. That is why they signed him, to provide something extra, something special, something the other squad players cannot manage.
 Zidane has plenty of wingers, and he cycled through them all in the fast and furious finish to the season as Madrid ground out 10 wins from 10 games to snatch the title from rivals Barcelona.
 The coach was not shy of chopping and changing, with Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, Marco Asensio, Lucas Vazquez and even outcast Gareth Bale being given the chance to flank striker Karim Benzema after football resumed in Spain.
 Asensio was the best of the bunch and made a good impact after returning from a long-term injury, but none were capable of producing consistently and decisively.
 In Benzema, Madrid have one brilliant player capable of undoing Manchester City, but the French forward needs a ‘socio’, as they say in Spain - partner - who can be his foil.
 Hazard was supposed to be that man when he moved from Stamford Bridge for €100 million (£91m/$120m), and the duo have shown flashes of what they can achieve together. When they link up, sparks fly and Madrid’s attack goes from one- dimensional to electric.

Miller says the district has put together four back-to-school plans to choose from. Plan one is to go back to school as usual, with online learning from home as an option. Plan two is to go back to school in-person, but with social distancing precautions in place. Plan three is a hybrid model. In plan three, pre-kindergarten through fifth-grade students will go to school in-person, while sixth through 12th-grade students will learn online, from home. In plan four, all grades will learn online, from home.
 For now, Miller says the school district hopes to go with plan two, but they won't make a final decision until they get closer to their start date.
 "It's a fluid situation. We're checking data every day. We meet every day about this. It's, you know, first and foremost we gotta' keep our kids and teachers safe," says Miller.
 Union City Schools will not require students to wear masks if they decide to hold in-person class. Like in Weakley County, desks will be spread out, temperature checks will be taken when students enter a bus or building, and schools will be cleaned thoroughly.
 When students go back to school, the cafeteria will be yet another place of change. During lunch, students will be spread out, and in some cases, they might have assigned seats.
 "Assigned seating is going to be very important, because if we're going to have to trace where a student has been in the last 48 hours, we're going to want to know what seats they sat in and who they were in close contact with," says Foster.
 Weakley County Schools will also allow students to opt into an online program if they're not comfortable with in-person learning. Union City Schools will provide students who choose online learning with laptops and access to reliable internet if they need those things.

Upward of 2,000 new jobs are on the way to Kansas, with Urban Outfitters announcing Wednesday they would be building a new e-commerce distribution center in Wyandotte County.
   
 Gov. Laura Kelly framed the move as a coup for the state's economic development in light of COVID-19 and the resulting rise in unemployment, with the 880,000-square-foot facility set to be built near the Kansas Speedway.
   
 "We didn't know when we first started this that we would be facing the worst public health crisis in a century," Kelly said at a news conference announcing the move. "But despite COVID-19, today's announcement has furthered our resolve that Kansas is on the right path. This is a transformational project for our state."
   
 Urban Outfitters will invest $350 million in the facility's construction, and David Ziel, the company's chief development officer, framed the move as a "long-term investment" in the region and state.
   
 "This is a strategic piece," Ziel said. "We're not about building after building. We're about culture."
   
 It is not clear how much in the way of public support was used to lure the Philadelphia-based lifestyle company to the site, with those figures not set to be announced for another six to eight weeks.
   
 But Kansas City Mayor David Altvey said the additional revenue brought into the city and area school district would be upward of $500,000 -- a considerable amount, he said.
   
 The project is also a partnership with Dallas-based developer Hillwood Development, as well as NASCAR, which owns the land where the facility is set to be constructed.
   
 And while the facility is set to most directly benefit the Kansas City area, Ziel said the company would be recruiting "at the broadest range we possibly can" to fill the jobs, which will pay at least $18 an hour.
   
 U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran said the move was a testament to the quality of the state's workforce and the work ethic Kansans possess. And officials said they are hopeful that Urban Outfitters might expand its role in the state further going forward.
   
 And Moran said the company's reputation might entice other firms to pursue economic development opportunities in the Kansas City area and beyond.
   
 "You set the stage for other developments in Kansas City and throughout our state," Moran said. "The reputation of Urban Outfitters is renowned, internationally known and the arrival of your company to our state gives us the opportunity to use you. I believe other companies will look directly at Kansas because you've chosen our state to be your new home."

When the Irish left Louvain everybody was convinced that their destination was Rome, that is, except the Earls themselves. Their intention was to reach Milan, a Spanish territory, where they hoped to receive a reply, this time favourable, from the King to the letter they had sent him before they set out. The English ambassador was in no doubt that O’Neill was heading to Rome ‘where he can promise himself no other relief than what may be derived from bulls and benedictions’, and even so he had no intention of making it any easier for them. He wrote in French to the Duke of Lorraine, whose territory the Irish were approaching, that King James expected that the ‘fugitive rebels … against whom the door to Spain was shut’, would be refused entry. He also sent him a French translation of the English king’s proclamation against them.

Satrica Williams, president of Girlie Girls, said the events are "going to allow the kids to get off those devices and get out and do something hands-on and in our park. We look forward to the communication part ... the kids being able to get out and communicate with others. This will give them a chance to see their friends."
 "It's going to be something fun to get and do with the kids and families,"Anita Barker, another member with the Girlie Girls Mentoring Program.
 She said it's also a good way for girls in their program to achieve their required volunteer service hours while having fun.
 All of the Partners in Parks Outdoor Fun Series events are free but require pre-registration. A number of the events have 1-2 time slots to allow for multiple parties to attend while keeping social distance protocols. Masks are strongly encouraged.
 "I'm so proud of how the community collaborates with the city on all these wonderful events for kids, parents, seniors — a diverse group," said Karen Hardy, Park and Recreation area supervisor. "It brings out awareness, collaboration with the community. Like a lot of kids don't know what Sasol is, or what is What Works or the Girlie Girls — it gives young adults opportunities to see what these entities do ... they'll know that they do a lot of community service. They see behind the scenes."

If you ask any customer what the biggest negative is when it comes to new and emerging technologies, you'll get a pretty rapid answer of "vendor lock-in." You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't give a customer the opportunity to build multiple, "best-of-breed" products into a comprehensive strategy, you're going to fall by the wayside pretty quickly.
