Apple has put Taiwan headquartered Wistron on probation, dealing a severe blow to the iPhone manufacturer and Indian Government's make- in-India plans. The phone maker also confirmed lapses in supplier code of conduct that led to payment delays for the employees, leading to the unrest that caused severe damage. We have placed Wistron on probation and they will not receive any new business from Apple before they complete corrective actions. Apple employees, along with independent auditors, will monitor their progress. Our main objective is to make sure all the workers are treated with dignity and respect, and fully compensated promptly, said Apple in a statement on Saturday. This comes on the back of the violence last Saturday when thousands of employees created an unrest in Wistron's facility in Kolar district over unpaid dues. Wistron , one of the main manufacturers of Apple products had previously announced Rs 1,947 crore investment in India. The US phone maker's statement will be a big blow to India's PLI scheme to handset makers who have not only planned to invest in India but also hire thousands in their facilities. A halt in Wistron's one facility may also impact the roll out of iPhone 12 from India , slotted for next year. Apple said its employees and independent auditors had worked around the clock to investigate the issues which occurred at Wistron’s Narasapura facility. While these investigations are ongoing, our preliminary findings indicate violations of our Supplier Code of Conduct by failing to implement proper working hour management processes. This led to payment delays for some workers in October and November, said the company. The US giant said it was very disappointed and taking immediate steps to address these issues . We are very disappointed and Wistron has taken disciplinary action and is restructuring their recruitment and payroll teams in Narasapura. They have also set up an employee assistance program and a 24-hour grievance hotline in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, and English to ensure all workers at the facility can voice any concerns, anonymously, the statement added. Wistron on Saturday, sacked its vice president for India business following the violence at the Narasupara facility.

“Their length really bothered us, kind of like it did when we played at Pierre. Everything was kind of around the 3-point line in the first half,” said Watertown head coach Zach Wevik. “We didn’t get anything at the basket and we didn’t get the ball swung against them. It’s hard to get action, it’s hard to get movement and it’s hard to get effective stuff when you’re going east and west with the basketball.”
 Let’s be honest, a lot of that had to with a Harrisburg team that started five players 6-foot-3 or taller. Watertown’s starting lineup featured one player 6-3 or taller.
 The Arrows really didn’t get much inside and connected on only 5-of-17 3-point attempts in the game.
 “If we wouldn’t have been so good defensively for three quarters, we wouldn’t have had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter,” said Harrisburg head coach Scott Langerock. “Three quarters of great defense put us in that position, no doubt.”
 It wasn’t as if Harrisburg quit guarding the Arrows in the final period. Watertown did a better job of moving on offense and also crated extra scoring opportunities with some full-court pressure defense.
 The results was a 16-3 scoring spurt that concluded with Cole Holden’s conventional three-point play with 2:07 remaining that trimmed Harrisburg’s lead down to four (41-37).
 The Tigers held on by hitting three free throws and also getting a layup from Blaze Lubbers down the stretch.
 “I thought we did a better job getting some more effective movement with some curls and other stuff in the second half, but it was just of one of those things where it was too little, too late,” said Wevik.
 The game, as the score indicates, wasn’t an offensive showdown. Harrisburg dictated the tempo with its defense, but also proved to be very deliberate on offense.
 “We talk about just being so impatient,” said Langerock. “It’s a double-edged sword for us because most of the guys we put on the floor are scorers. They like to score and they can score in a lot of different ways, but the bad side of that is that they think they can score every time they touch the ball.”
 That was part of equation that fueled Watertown’s fourth-quarter rally. The Arrows were coming off a comeback win at Pierre and nearly pulled off another big comeback against the Tigers.
 “The message in the locker room was two things. No. 1 is that we’re not good enough when we’re flat. When we’re not being the ones dictating things and being aggressive, we’re not going to be good enough to win games against good teams,” said Wevik.
 “No. 2 is our heart and coming back from large deficits. You take that and you can really build off that, but you don’t want to be the team that always gets down and has to claw its way back.”
 Harrisburg’s offense was spearheaded by senior guard Conner Geddes, who tallied a game-high 19 points. Blaze Lubbers added nine and Brayden Phipps seven for the Tigers, who shot 43 percent (17 of 40) from the field and held a 25-24 edge on the boards.

 Cork played 45 minutes for the club's Under-23s on Monday and the midfielder, will need more game time before being considered for a return.
 "Corky is going to be a few weeks yet, he still needs more reserve football," said Dyche of the 31-year-old, who signed a new Clarets contract this week.

On Sunday, several small, multi-ethnic parties will be vying for seats in the city council after campaigning on bread-and-butter issues. But the nationalist HDZ and SDA parties hope that, among them, they will secure a two-thirds majority in the council and keep their grip on power.
 While acknowledging that the nationalists have armies of faithful voters whom they mobilize by stoking ethnic mistrust, non-nationalist election candidates in Mostar hope the past 12 years has shown that those two parties are too corrupt and incompetent.
 "I think that many people finally realized that the abstract, ethnic interests are meaningless while their children are leaving (Mostar) in droves in search of decent jobs and a decent life" elsewhere in Europe, said Amna Popovac, a candidate from the multi-ethnic Platform for Progress party.
 The nationalists are now promising to fix the city's many problems as if "Martians and not they were running Mostar, unchecked, for the past 12 years," she added.
 Miljan Rupar's name will also be on the ballot. The 35-year-old, who is running as a candidate from the multi-ethnic Social Democrat Party, decided to get involved in politics after realizing that over 38 friends and relatives, including his sister, had left Mostar "for good" in search of a better life abroad.
 Rupar wants his city focused on the future, just like the international school where he teaches physics, the United World College branch in Mostar. The school is one of 17 around the globe and run by a movement founded in 1962 with the aim of overcoming Cold War divisions by bringing high-achieving youngsters from all over to live and learn together.
 "When I walk into the classroom or attend our bi-weekly assembly and see students and teachers from all over the world, including from various parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who share the same values and goals, it gives me hope," he said.
 Political journalist Faruk Kajtaz, however, thinks that hope could prove to be treacherous in the divided city, despite local voters' well-justified grievances. He notes that not just Mostar but all of Bosnia has long been politically and administratively fragmented along ethnic lines.
 "Maybe too much is expected from the people of Mostar," he said. "(But) just the fact that citizens of Mostar will finally get a chance to vote for their local legislators is in itself a big win for democracy."

Vedo grande entusiasmo da parte della societa civile, in molti si stanno avvicinando: abbiamo un progetto nazionale e non localistico che vede la Campania protagonista», furono le parole di Molteni in una delle poche uscite pubbliche. Ora lascia il timone ai dirigenti locali, che intanto stanno approfittando della diatriba interna a Forza Italia per svuotarla provando ad esercitare un ruolo di leadership della coalizione. La Lega, in vista delle prossime comunali di Napoli, Salerno e Caserta, dovra dimostrare la capacita di essere attrattiva verso coloro che navigano nell'ambito del centrodestra, ma non trovano punti di riferimenti certi. Del resto, i berlusconiani sono alla presa con una faida interna mentre Fratelli d'Italia cresce ma non secondo la media nazionale del leader Giorgia Meloni. La scelta di nominare il consigliere regionale Severino Nappi coordinatore cittadino della Lega a Napoli gia si inseriva nel progetto di radicamento e allargamento all'esterno allo stesso tempo. I primi passi sono stati compiuti ed al Carroccio hanno aderito 17 consiglieri municipali. «A Napoli la Lega cresce come non mai! 17 adesioni di nuovi consiglieri e una struttura in ogni quartiere. Siamo pronti per offrire idee, competenza e impegno per risollevare la citta dopo anni di malgoverno», il commento entusiastico dello stesso Salvini via Twitter alla notizia delle nuove adesioni a cui ha lavorato Nappi. Si tratta di consiglieri municipali provenienti appunto da Fi (alla Quarta Municipalita addirittura l'intero gruppo di 4 passa con la Lega) o da liste civiche. Definiti gli ingressi ed i responsabili per ogni Municipalita. Si va da Giovanna Mazzone e Maria Pia Petrosino per la Prima Municipalita coordinata da Paolo Santanelli, a Gaetano Barone alla Seconda guidata da Bona Mustilli fino appunto a tutto il gruppo ormai ex Fi composto da Giuseppe Basile, Andrea Cristiani, Rosario Arino, Pasquale Persico e Giuseppe Lombardi nel quartiere San Lorenzo-Vicaria.
