We all want a utopian world where everyone is fair, honest and kind. Unfortunately, in a world where there is pride, greed, hate and power, it is unattainable. For that reason, the world needs law enforcement.
 Americans are fortunate because if there are laws we don’t like, then we, as a people, have the power to change them. That is what sets us apart from other nations. Even though many seem to have either forgotten it or want to ignore it, "we the people" have the ultimate power.
 Like any other profession, law enforcement has some officers who do not live up to their oaths of their positions. Some are power-hungry tyrants who think they are above the laws they are hired to enforce. In addition, there are some Barney Fife types who bumble along and are a little overzealous in the desire for a case or to bring someone in for booking. From what I have experienced, those types are few and far between.

The outdoor gear company Patagonia is the latest company to announce an advertising boycott of Facebook and its Instagram app for the month of July — or longer — saying the social media giant has “failed to take steps to stop the spread of hateful lies and dangerous propaganda on its platform.” Patagonia joins The North Face and the outdoor gear company REI, which have announced similar boycotts in recent days. It is not clear how much the boycotts will affect Facebook’s advertising revenue, which was nearly $70 billion in 2019, making up nearly all of its total revenue for the year. According to Facebook's ad library, Patagonia spent nearly $1 million on ads about social issues or politics between May 2018 and June 2020. The ads got the “social issues” moniker because they were about environmental issues. A representative for Facebook did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Monday. Last week, civil rights groups called on large advertisers to stop Facebook ad campaigns during July, saying the social network isn’t doing enough to curtail racist and violent content on its platform. The groups in the “#StopHateforProfit” campaign, launched Wednesday, include Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, Sleeping Giants, Color Of Change, Free Press and Common Sense. The groups say Facebook amplifies white supremacists, allows posts that incite violence and contain political propaganda and misinformation, and doesn’t stop “bad actors using the platform to do harm.” The big tech companies have struggled over how to manage the floods of posts and videos that users put on their platforms every day.

 The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought havoc on the global economy, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate nearly doubled between February and April and, despite some modest gains, many people are still without jobs.
 To help people weather the storm, the government pushed through the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which has lessened the financial burden felt by many individuals and families. However, since the initial release of CERB, things have changed. When it was introduced in March, the benefit was meant to run for 16 weeks and expire in early July. Recently, CERB was extended another eight weeks.
 Nonetheless, despite CERB's continued, extended availability, it is not a viable long-term economic solution. As such, now is as good a time as any to start trying to get back into the job market. If you're ready and able, there are some things you can do today to set yourself up for success in a market that, hopefully, will bounce back fairly quickly.
 First, you can update your resume. Generally, you should update your resume every six to 12 months to ensure that it's accurate. You should also update it whenever you get a promotion, obtain a new certification, master a new skill, or complete any major project. If it's been a while since you were looking for new employment, Rezi Résumé Software can help get your resume in a good place. This AI-powered service helps you create an optimized resume that can better register on applicant tracking systems (ATS) used by human resources departments. Pro lifetime subscriptions are on sale now for only $29 USD.
 Secondly, you can begin to look for remote work. Leveraging the skills you already have by finding contract jobs can help you build a bridge between unemployment and full-time employment. FlexJobs is one of the best job boards for remote work, with fully vetted, high-quality opportunities added every day, and subscriptions are on sale right now. You can get one year of access for half-off, just $24.95 USD today.
 Finally, you can begin working on your interviewing skills. Once companies do begin interviewing for full-time positions, you're going to be in a competitive market. Interview Better Than Anyone by an Award-Winning MBA Professor can give you an edge when it comes time to interview. Led by Chris Haroun, a venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs employee, this course will teach you what interviewers want to hear and how to sell yourself capably in an interview. You can get lifetime access to the course now for only $10.99 USD.
 It's tough out there, but if you start preparing now, you can give yourself at better shot at finding success.

The evidence that Nov. 3 may not resemble past presidential elections has accrued with each passing primary. First came Wisconsin on April 7, when officials processed a record number of absentee ballots - nearly 1.1 million votes. The U.S. Supreme Court had ordered officials to accept all mail ballots postmarked by Election Day and received six days later, delaying the release of results until the following Monday.          Then came Pennsylvania, and Georgia and Nevada after that - all states that saw record absentee voting, with about 3 million mail ballots cast in all.          In Georgia and Nevada, voters stood in hours-long lines past midnight, contributing to delayed tallies. In Georgia, still more delays ensued after difficulty with new voting machines forced many voters to fill out provisional ballots on paper.          Last Tuesday, a full week after the Georgia primary, election workers in Gwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta, sat at tables spread out across the Rhodes Jordan Park community gym, piles of ballots still in front of them for processing. Gwinnett processed a total of 85,000 mailed ballots in this year's primaries - compared to a normal count of 18,000, according to county spokesman Joe Sorenson. The county finished on Friday - 10 days after polls had closed.          "Given the complexity of the task, that's pretty good, to be honest," Sorenson said.          Pennsylvania processed 1.5 million mail ballots this month, compared to 84,000 in its 2016 primary. In Nevada, this year's number was 483,788, compared to about 25,000 in 2016.

Many Americans are more than a little dismayed at the notion of turning away from our police departments. Mayors in many larger cities across this great land are not only demanding the local law enforcement officials back off and let rioters and looters run amok, they are actually talking of defunding the departments. Some went so far as to say disband police departments completely.
 This idea is beyond foolish. If someone is in favor of the latter, then cancel every law on the books now. Why have laws if they cannot be enforced? This is the same argument I use in debates on proposed gun laws that are unenforceable. If they cannot or will not be enforced, there is no reason to have them.
 Stop for a moment and think rationally. Can anyone imagine what the country would be like without law enforcement? It would be total chaos and law of the jungle mentality.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A half-dozen senior advisers to President Donald Trump have repeatedly voted by mail, according to election records obtained by The Associated Press, undercutting the president’s argument that the practice will lead to widespread fraud this November.           The aides include Betsy DeVos, the education secretary who has permanent absentee voting status in her home state of Michigan. Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, voted absentee in Texas in 2018 and didn't vote in the general election two years earlier when Trump's name was on the ballot.          Two other senior Trump campaign officials — chief operating officer Michael Glassner and deputy campaign manager Bill Stepien — have repeatedly voted by mail in New Jersey. And Nick Ayers, a senior campaign adviser who was previously chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, has voted by mail in Georgia since 2014.           In most election years, voting by mail is an unremarkable event. But this year is different because Trump has railed against state efforts to expand access to mail-in voting as an alternative to waiting in lines at polling places during a pandemic. He has argued without evidence that mail-in voting will lead to fraud and warned Monday that foreign countries could print ballots.          That, some experts say, is a double standard that amounts to voter suppression.          “These are people who are taking advantage of — which is perfectly legal — their right to vote absentee," said Trevor Potter, the president of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, who previously served as a general counsel on both of John McCain's Republican presidential campaigns. "But they don’t want other people to do the same thing.”

It comes as no surprise to me that all of those in positions of authority across the country in blue states and cities – the two left coasts – are using the COVID-19 pandemic to further their political agendas. These governors, mayors, county commissioners, and other “bosses” reside in places that are dominated by progressives, and therefore know for a fact they are not only smarter and better than their own citizens, they are almost certainly smarter and better than you, as well.
 They have imposed and are strictly enforcing policies that give them enormous power, and which are in direct contradiction and violation of the restrictions placed on government by the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and in many cases, by their own state constitutions. They do have some limited powers that are granted them in conjunction with the president's declaring a national emergency – which does give _him_ sweeping powers – but to them only as the president directs. And what is happening now is not in accordance with the president’s directions.
 It is very easy to contrast and compare this behavior to that of the leaders in the red states – comprising most of the middle of the country, including Oklahoma – that locked down only as long as necessary, and no more than was absolutely required. The blue state leaders have enacted policies that are severe, and have extended the lockdown again and again, while red states leaders have relaxed the restrictions as the circumstances dictate. Red state leaders receive no joy from being dictatorial, stripping people of their rights and ordering people around. Red state leaders only follow the law and do what they were elected to do, and listen to their citizens. Blue state leaders grab more and more power, unilaterally extending their control and authority, and arrest and silence those who oppose their tactics.
