The same courtesy is what we hope to experience doing business in Lagos State, even as we intend to significantly invest in infrastructure and support the State in building stronger bilateral relationships between Nigeria and the Netherlands.”

The AFC Championship matchup kicks off between the Tennessee and Kansas City on Saturday, and even though the Chiefs are over 7 point favorites to win, the Titans have proved they are a force to be reckoned with on the road after taking down both the New England Patriots and the Baltimore Ravens in order to reach this final playoff game.
 While the Chiefs briefly looked like they were going to lose to the Houston Texans last week, trailing by three touchdowns in the first quarter, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the team roared back with a vengeance in the second half. Not to be overshadowed in their journey to the Super Bowl, Chiefs' kicker Harrison Butker, the 6'4, 205-pound powerhouse leg whose career field-goal percentage in 89.7. The 24-year-old is now the highest-rated kicker in the franchise's history.
 Cheering Butker on during every game, his wife Isabelle, whom he married in a devout Christian ceremony on February 10, 2018. The couple dated for nearly 8 years prior to tying the knot, and after Butker proposed to Isabelle on May 9, 2017, he shared a tribute on Instagram to the woman who would become his future wife.
 He wrote, "From the first moments of our relationship, back in freshman year of high school, I always envisioned marrying you and raising a family together. You push me to be a better man and are so patient and forgiving when I fall short. I am truly amazed at how God has worked in your life and in our relationship and pray we continue to learn and grow from each other. Can't wait to see what our future holds together as a married couple! I love you Izzy."

Congressman Jeff Van Drew, R-2nd, made national news in his freshman year in Congress, which he started as a Democrat and ended as a Republican.
 Long known as a moderate in the state Assembly and Senate, many thought Van Drew would continue to be a solid Democrat who occasionally deviated from the party on issues like gun rights, after he was elected in 2018 to fill the seat of longtime Congressman Frank LoBiondo, a moderate Republican.
 But right from the start, Van Drew set himself apart by voting "no" for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker -- fulfilling a campaign promise but confusing those on the House floor. He was supposed to call out a name of someone for speaker, so his "no" vote was recorded as "present."
 Then he was one of the few Democrats calling for bipartisan compromise on a budget to end what became the longest federal government shutdown in history. Later, he visited the southern border and came back saying there was, indeed, a crisis there. He supported both some funding for a border wall, and increased funding for housing and services to undocumented migrants. Van Drew was also one of just two Demcorats to first vote against proceeding with an impeachment inquiry, and to vote against both articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.
 And on Dec. 19, 2019, he announced his party change to Republican while sitting next to Trump in the Oval Office.

Bulls have broken and held above it in recent days, printing an engulfing daily candle last Thursday and marking a higher-high and low of Friday, albeit closing as a spinning top - (bullish meets bearish).

NEW ORLEANS (AP) " ExhibitBE came to a triumphant close on Martin Luther King Day, five years ago. Some of the original murals that crowded the walls of the derelict five-story DeGaulle Manor apartment building are still intact, though some have been tagged over or altered. The building itself is still a sprawling unoccupied shell, sprouting weeds and strewn with trash, old mattresses and other debris. The hazardous site is no longer open to the public.
 ExhibitBE (sometimes spelled Exhibit Be) remains the most important New Orleans artwork of the 21st-century. Brandon 'bmike' Odums, the 29-year-old mastermind behind the project, billed it as the largest street art exhibit in the American South. But it came to represent much more.
 The random collision of dozens of enormous artworks by area graffiti writers and street artists transformed the forlorn architecture into a collaborative surrealist masterpiece that no museum could contain. More importantly, Odums' portraits of civil rights heroes from Harriet Tubman to Martin Luther King Jr. to Muhammad Ali, made it a Crescent City icon of the Black Lives Matter movement.
 Though the DeGaulle Manor had closed before Hurricane Katrina, the ruined building tapped into the post-flood gestalt perfectly. It symbolized the displacement of much of the population, particularly of lower-income African Americans.
 During the creation of ExhibitBE, Odums said that it was very characteristic of New Orleans to change a blighted environment into something beautiful.
 'Whether it's the food, the music, the jazz funerals, we find ways to make something out of nothing. That's true to street art. That's true to graffiti in general. That's true to hip hop in general, but I feel like New Orleans has always done it with a certain effortlessness.'
 When ExhibitBE was created in 2014, thousands made a pilgrimage to the desolate site to see the wild, monumental artwork and acknowledge all it represented. Erykah Badu sang at the official closing of the show. Odums, a NOCCA grad and former UNO student, instantly became a New Orleans star.
 As he planned the big project, Odums said he'd been advised that it would be impossible to get the 'lone wolves' of the graffiti scene to cooperate. Happily, the paint-spattered renegades must have recognized that the moment had come to prove once and for all that graffiti was the most important contemporary visual art form.
 'I'm happy for what it represented; what can happen when the community and creative people come together,' said Odums in a recent telephone conversation.
 Odums said he's not surprised that some of the original art has been painted over.
 'That's the natural organic lifespan of street art,' he said. 'That's to be expected.'
 One of the most striking images in all of ExhibitBE was Odums' haunting 50-foot painting of a teenage murder victim. In recent years, someone has replaced the realistic eyes in Odums' mega-portrait with cartoonishly doleful eyes that turn what was poignant into something maudlin. Odums said he thinks the face may have been altered for a movie shoot.
 His magnificent suite of portraits in the apartment complex's former rec room remain untouched.
 The fate of the deteriorating apartment complex, which is owned by Granaio LLC, according to the New Orleans Assessor's office website, is unknown. Odums has moved on to other projects, such as his current solo exhibit at the Newcomb Art Museum on the Tulane University campus.
 Looking back on ExhibitBE after five years, he was a bit rueful.
 'If anyone can go back to their younger self, they'd see they had a lot more courage. There was a lot of fearlessness in that moment.'

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan is ready to talk to the opposition for the welfare of the people, said PM Imran's special aide, Naeemul Haque on Sunday.  
 Haque was speaking to Geo News anchor Shahzad Iqbal on his programme "Naya Pakistan" where he urged the opposition to support the government in solving the problems of the common man.
 "We have only three-and-a-half years left," he said, referring to the government's tenure. "I urge the opposition to render their full support. If the opposition even hints towards it [cooperation] we will hold talks with them for the benefit of the people."
 The statement is an important one considering the government and opposition have been at loggerheads over the past year. Opposition parties have accused the government of using anti-graft body NAB to settle scores. The government, on the other hand, has accused opposition politicians of looting the country’s wealth and stashing it abroad.  
 Speaking on the recent criticism of the government by its allies, Haque said their concerns were valid. “We have to tell them [allies] that the government doesn’t have funds,” he said. “Politics is about ‘give and take’.”

 Although Kenny Clark has made tremendous strides the last two years to become a force, the Bears have the numbers advantage along the defensive line. Akeim Hicks is still young enough to be a dominant force when his elbow injury completely heals and Eddie Goldman is only slightly less effective at the nose. He's a Pro Bowl alternate. A big surprise as a rookie, Bilal Nichols took a step back in his second year largely due to a broken hand and it's effect early, and can be expected at a higher level again. The Bears also have a line coach in Jay Rodgers who they acknowledge as being able to work wonders at developing talent. Nick Williams is one of those, as was Roy Robertson- Harris.
 The Bears have a sizable edge at inside linebacker, or rather, they had a sizable advantage. With both Nick Kwiatkoski and Danny Trevathan free agents, and Kevin Pierre-Louis out of contract as well, it's almost impossible to stack the Bears up against the Packers at this position because they can't be sure who will be back.
 What is certain is when a torn pectoral muscle heals, Roquan Smith is head and shoulders above any Packers inside linebacker. A personal issue he had which caused a missed game last season aside, Smith has been ascending. Over the course of the final three games before his injury, he reached a new plateau in development. Destructive, ferocious and violent were terms the coaching staff began using in describing him. B.J. Goodson was a Giants castoff who showed improvement and Blake Martinez makes a lot of tackles but is deficient as a coverage linebacker. Both were third-day draft choices, nearly comparable to Kwiatkoski and not at the level of Trevathan, let alone Smith.

One could argue that his positions are debatable, arguable. Tearing up NAFTA and the TPP was praised by many progressive elements in the US, especially Labor and environmentalists. But most other agreements and treaties with the US’s allies and adversaries were viewed by many as carefully crafted, taking in much considerations. The obvious problem is not whether abandoning any of these other agreements is good or bad, but that he did it unilaterally and without much strategic thinking. This is the justification for Europe to go its own way now that the US has finally given them the green light to do so.

The Alliance for Social Equity and Public Accountability (ASEPA) has said an arrest warrant issued for a social media commentator, Kelvin Taylor, amounts to judicial tyranny.
 Mensah Thompson, the Alliance's Executive Director said in a statement Sunday that the Judiciary is the most powerful and dangerous of the three arms of government and hence its decisions must be scrutinised.
 "Now if you are giving a fellow man the authority to take away the rights of a fellow man bestowed on him by God and the State (sometimes as priceless as life), then there should be absolutely NO reason why Citizens shouldn't be able to criticize their conduct and keep them in check especially in the administration of that Power (Justice)," Mr Thompson said in the statement.
 According to the court, the arrest warrant was issued for Mr Taylor because he scandalised it when he alleged that Justice Kyei-Baffuor, an Appeals Court judge, was promoted merely because he was doing the bidding of President Nana Akufo-Addo's government in the trial of some five people accused of embezzling $4 million belonging to the National Communications Authority (NCA).
 Read ASEPA's full reaction to the arrest warrant below.
 JUSTICE KYEI-BAFFUOR'S BENCH WARRANT FOR KEVIN TAYLOR, A FLUID JUDICIAL TYRANNY?
 This week one of the issues that became very contentious was the bench warrant Justice Kyei Baffuor issued on freelance journalist Kevin Ekow Kevin Taylor for criticising him in one of his media broadcasts.
 It turns out Justice Kyei-Baffuor who is the victim of the attack ie; the complainant, became a Judge in his own Court, on his own case and issued a warrant for the arrest of the journalist (an arrest warrant for life!...now that's very intimidating).
 Quite surprisingly everyone is quiet about this, no journalist has spoken about it and not even the GJA has had the balls to scrutinise that action of Judge Kyei-Baffuor against their own (well he may not be, but it is symbolic). As a Public Accountability Activist whose primary interest is the accountability of Power, I get very uncomfortable by such occurrences.
 You see among all the three arms of Government, the Judiciary is the most powerful and dangerous one if you ask me, people's fate is decided in a split second and their rights enshrined on them by the State taken away without any apologies.
 This is the apogee of Power, you cannot compare Political Power to this one...but it turns out it is the arm of government that is fondly left unchecked and unscrutinised (and we are comfortable leaving it at that)!
 You see Judges are human beings just like us, clothed with Judicial Authority of State to administer Justice.
 Now if you are giving a fellow man the authority to take away the rights of a fellow man bestowed on him by God and the State( sometimes as priceless as life), then there should be absolutely NO reason why Citizens shouldn't be able to criticize their conduct and keep them in check especially in the administration of that Power (Justice).
 The Judiciary just like the two other arms of government also needs straightening, we have left our Judiciary unchecked and unscrutinised for far too long and people have lost their lives, their livelihood and their future all because of the recklessness of some Judges in the administration of justice... and the blood of all those people are on the head of this Nation because we failed to watch out for them.
 I listened to the current Chief Justice, Justice Anin Yeboah admit during his vetting that indeed he made a mistake in one or two of his judgements, in comparing his records he emphasised the point that he has sat on several cases and if out of over 30 cases he has decided, he got it wrong in only one or two occasions, then it's impressive.
 Well on paper 2 errors out of 30 cases looks like a very impressive record, the only problem is that in each of those instances someone's freedom or rights were taken away from them wrongly.
 Now that's how dangerous the Judiciary is.
 And so we owe it a duty to ourselves as a Nation to rise and begin to speak up against this dreaded Judicial tyranny that is beginning to swallow this Nation else it eats up the fibre of our Justice System and brings us to our knees in the not so distant future.
 Civil Societies must begin to scrutinise the work of the Judiciary more and the Media should start pointing their 'guns' more on the Judiciary than the Politicians because most often than NOT the Judiciary is but a conduit through which these Politicians achieve their objectives, and once the conduit is kept in check, we are almost free as a Nation and our Society will be just and equitable for all.
 Soon I shall Publish a little investigative Paper on Appeals Court Judges who were promoted to the Supreme Court and the last cases they decided before they were promoted.
 It surely will make for an interesting read.
 Judges indeed are not God!

 Pearson said there is no sense not working on Saturdays when an opportunity presents itself. So starting last Saturday, Pearson took up Gaines' offer and started work at a choice spot near the line of cash registers at Magnolia Market, where he can greet thousands of Magnolia maniacs who flock to the destination.
 Before he started, Gaines called him over for a meeting, Pearson said. He and other Magnolia employees formed a circle around something large that was covered by a blanket. As Pearson approached, Gaines, known on his "Fixer Upper" TV show for the "big reveal," whisked off the covering to display what Pearson describes as the Rolls Royce of shoeshine stands.
 "It is out of sight," Pearson said of the stand. "I don't have the words to describe it. It is out of this world. When Chip took off that cover, I like to cried a moon river. I had more water in my eyes than Lake Waco has."
 Chip Gaines was not available for comment on this story, but Magnolia spokesman John Marsicano said Gaines and his wife, Joanna, are happy to play host to Pearson on Saturdays.
 "It was important to Chip and Jo that Robert also had access to any additional tools or resources he may need to do the work he’s enjoyed doing for so many years, and we felt he may like a new stand to work from," Marsicano said. "Robert has been a warm and familiar face around town for a very long time, and it’s really an honor for us to play even a small role in this next chapter for Robert."
