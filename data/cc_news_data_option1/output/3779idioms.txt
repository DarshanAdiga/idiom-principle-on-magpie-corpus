As executive director of the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association I have had the opportunity to work with Mr. O'Shea on energy issues. As an owner of a renewable energy business, Mr. O'Shea understands that high-energy costs can make it very difficult for homeowners, farmers or business owners to make ends meet. Therefore Mr. O'Shea has spent considerable time working to reduce high- energy costs by encouraging people and business to generate their own energy by installing a solar energy system. This reduces energy costs, creates jobs and promotes a clean environment.

JOHANNESBURG – Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has told The Centre for Global Development that South Africa is looking forward to debt relief for African Union (AU) countries that have accumulated debt during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Mkhize delivered the keynote address at the centre’s conference on mitigating the economic and health impact of COVID-19.
 South Africa has had to find financing from organisations such as the International Monetary Fund which gave the country to help fight the pandemic.
 The African Development Bank has also given grants to boost the AU's efforts to mobilise a continental response to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Mkhize said about US $40 billion have been committed towards the fight against the coronavirus.
 “We are looking forward to debt relief for member states which we believe can be managed by reprofiling, or even cancellation, of some of those debts. we convey our gratitude to the G20 for agreeing to halt the repayment of such debt until the end of 2020.”

Jennifer Aniston missed out on an Emmy but proved herself as an award-worthy first responder when a ceremony stunt got overheated.
 In a bit during Sunday night’s Emmys, host Jimmy Kimmel sprayed an envelope holding a winner’s name with disinfectant then, for good measure, dropped it in a wire wastebasket and set it on fire.
 So far, so good, ceremony executive producer Reginald Hudlin said Monday. A test had been run beforehand, with a booster added to make the fire more visible, and things were going as planned when the scene was shot — including Aniston to the rescue.
 “Jennifer comes with a fire extinguisher. She puts the fire out. But the fire ain’t out,” he said with a laugh. She sprayed the wastebasket again, but as she and Kimmel bantered the fire flared again, bigger, and “we’re like ‘uh oh,’” Hudlin said.

Clemson coach Dabo Swinney has few worries about his football team on the field. Off it? That's another story. Swinney is concerned that the top- ranked Tigers' bye week — especially with players getting Friday and Saturday off — could result in the team having more contact with people and increase players' risk of exposure to the coronavirus. “Probably the same primary concern of every coach out there,” Swinney said. So far, so good. The Tigers (2-0), like all Atlantic Coast Conference teams, are getting tested three times a week and have had no positives through the first two games. “Our protocol's been really, really good,” Swinney said Tuesday. “I trust them. It's not like we get them all day, every day. We get them for about four hours max. So the other 20 hours comes down to trust, discipline and sacrifice.” Clemson will practice three days this week and have a team function Tuesday in place of its usual community service day during a week off. The team will reconvene after its break Sunday to get tested and start preparing to face Virginia on Oct. 3. The Tigers are motivated to do everything the right way as they pursue championship goals they missed out on last year by falling to LSU in the national title game, cornerback Sheridan Jones said. “It's having faith over fear,” Jones said. “Faith that we are going to have a season. Moving at that pace with that mindset has helped us to work day in, day out and stay focused on the task at hand.” Clemson has looked like a team on a mission. The Tigers have had easy wins over Wake Forest and The Citadel, beating the Bulldogs 49-0 this past Saturday for their first shutout in four years. Their play has been so efficient and effective, Swinney is having difficulty picking it apart. The offense,...

 Democrats I have talked to are worried that this could depress Democrats, or some of them say that they could also be motivated, because, if this does become a 6-3 majority for Republicans, Democrats might be going to the polls in higher numbers.

 Conservative Leader Erin O'Toole and his family waited for hours to be tested for COVID-19 last week in Ottawa before being turned away when the centre reached capacity. They eventually got tested in Quebec and are now self- isolating after results came back positive. Predictably, O'Toole blamed the delay on the Trudeau government.
 O'Toole's frustration was understandable, but he was pointing his finger at the wrong government. He and thousands of other people found that centres run by provincial governments, especially those in Ontario and Quebec, were suddenly overwhelmed by people looking to be tested for COVID-19.
 This was a thoroughly predictable situation, given that schools were reopening and children with any COVID-type symptoms had to get an all-clear before being allowed into class. Indeed, many health experts did predict this precise scenario for September. And yet it seemed to arrive as a bolt from the blue, with people lining up for hours just for a test and many turned away.
 The Ford government in Ontario, for one, promises a comprehensive fall plan as early as Tuesday of this week to deal with the spike in demand for testing and the arrival of the annual fall flu season, which threatens to add another layer of complication to an already fraught public health situation. It plans, among other things, to allow pharmacies to conduct some tests.
 The new plan can't come too soon. But Ontarians should be asking why it couldn't have been rolled out _before_ schools reopened, not a week or two after. That would have saved a lot of people a lot of worry and considerable time waiting in long lines. And it would have spared us all from the spectacle of a government that, once again, seems to be just behind the curve when it comes to responding to the pandemic.
 It can't be money. In July, the federal government rolled out its "Safe Restart Agreement" with the provinces. That involved a staggering $19 billion to support provincial governments in the complicated task of reopening society after the lockdown imposed in March to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
 A big chunk of that money -- $4.28 billion -- was earmarked specifically to help cover the cost of testing and contact tracing, which the experts have told us is key to getting on top of this disease. And of that amount, some $1.16 billion was to go to Ontario.
 That's a lot of money to open testing clinics and make sure there would be enough of them, in the right places, for the predictable moment when people would flood in to make sure they and their children were safe to resume something closer to normal life.
 Of course it's complicated, and of course public health officials have been working hard for months on many fronts to contain COVID-19. But it's not too much to expect that relatively simple steps like expanding hours at testing clinics or creating some new pop-up clinics could have been put in place before the surge in demand, not after.
 Ontario is, to be fair, ramping up the number of tests it conducts, topping 40,000 on Saturday on its way to a daily target of 50,000. But it's important to test the right people, not just anyone who turns up at a testing centre, and the message on that front has been mixed.
 Over the summer, Premier Doug Ford insisted that anyone who wants a test should be able to get one. But public health advice is changing. Alberta, for example, no longer recommends that people without symptoms get tested, mostly because that uncovered only a minuscule number of positive cases. With flu season around the corner, it wants to focus resources on those most at risk or most likely to spread COVID-19.
 Ontario should consider adjusting its advice to the public, or at least clarifying it. And it needs to show it is putting all that federal money for testing and tracing to the most effective use. The public has supported difficult health measures for many months now, and this is no time to lose its confidence.
