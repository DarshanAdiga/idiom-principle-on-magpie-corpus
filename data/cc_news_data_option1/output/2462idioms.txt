Staying flexible and communicating with schools and local school districts were two of the biggest themes to come out of Tuesday afternoon's first meeting of the task force the Florida High School Athletic Association's board of directors put together to look at the fall calendar.
   
 Local school officials, coaches, athletes and parents are all looking for answers, which remain elusive, on what will happen in the fall as the country continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 "I think in my own mind, what I've heard is the more flexibility we can allow each other, the better," committee member John Gerdes said. "I don't think we want to pin ourselves against the wall with any definite dates especially."
   
 FHSAA Executive Director George Tomyn said for now there are no changes to the fall calendar and the association remains optimistic that no changes will be necessary. Currently, football practice remains scheduled to start July 27.
   
 That doesn't mean, however, the FHSAA is ignoring the possibility that dramatic changes may occur, especially to the postseason, although it's premature to make any predictions or changes in late June.
   
 "I'm going to tread on some real thin ice and talk about the state series and the state championship," Tomyn said. "I'm not so sure we're going to be able to have that this year in the traditional format we had in the past."
   
 The big concern is the varying conditions around the state.
   
 Broward County Athletic Director Rocky Gillis said his area is still trying to get phase one of summer workouts started, adding that it will be difficult for his area to be ready for practice on July 27.
   
 Park Vista Athletic Director Pam Romero said her county was supposed to start allowing small groups of athletes getting together on July 6, but that was canceled. She said it's now likely that won't happen until late July and said her county might not be ready to play until after Labor Day.
   
 With the varied conditions, which change constantly, coming up with a firm plan for the fall, either going with status quo or coming up with other options, remain elusive.
   
 For now, Plan B, Tomyn said, is to react to situations as they may occur around the state and work with schools and school districts.
   
 "I don't think it can be specific because the state is too different," he said. "We have a hugely diverse state."
   
 Tomyn has been conscious to make sure the FHSAA doesn't overstep its reach into what should be left up to local school districts.
   
 "Our governor has said we're going to start schools on time, and it's up to local policymakers to make those decisions," he said. "I think it's very inappropriate for us to do something that is contrary to what our governor is saying to do. I feel very strongly about that. In reference to adjusting any kind of a schedule that impacts the fall, that also impacts the winter, which in turn impacts the spring. That's why we're comfortable in staying where we are right now."
   
 Should school start on time, there seems to be agreement that football and volleyball pose the biggest problems concerning playing games. It's felt that cross country, swimming, bowling and golf could go off as planned with certain adjustments.
   
 The committee did agree to survey local schools to get an idea on where they stood and to get input on moving forward.
   
 Among the issues discussed was how the FHSAA would be flexible with rules concerning the number of games played to be eligible for postseason and to look at the rankings system.
   
 The need to come up with best practice guidelines for officials to ensure their safety was also agreed to.
   
 The next meeting for the task force, which is led by incoming board president Lauren Otero, is scheduled for July 1.

But for now, this is the way. And Barnes and his staff are ushering caution in hopes for looser restrictions down the road.
 “The way that I look it is that’s what (KHSAA) said we can do, and that’s what we’ve got to do,” Barnes said. “And hopefully the first step to playing football in the fall is this right here. I hope as we progress through the summer, we can start adding and get our whole team together at the same time.
 “But it’s been good. Honestly, having them in small groups means a little bit more 1-on-1 time with a coach, which helps the younger guys on both ends. It helps us get to know them, and they get to know us. They get a little bit more 1-on-1 attention that they might not necessarily have gotten if we had everyone out here.”
 By June 29, barring any significant setbacks within the next week, high-touch sports such as football are set to enter the next phase of reopening, which includes the following parameters on the grid-iron:
 Groups of 50 or fewer are permitted in an area, divided into groups with no more than 11 individuals (10 players, one coach; nine players, two coaches; etc.)
 Shared equipment permitted, with frequent sanitation

Trump’s performance was not as lackluster as the attendance, but it says something that in a nearly two-hour speech, the most memorable part was a 17-minute riff on walking down a ramp and being able to drink water manfully. Trump’s show-stopper was when he drank some H2O with one hand and flung the cup to the side like a Viking discarding a drained flask of mead. The crowd burst into chants of “Four More Years!”
 Beyond that, there were only what in a normal time would be considered gaffes. He called COVID-19 “Kung flu” and recounted how he instructed his staff to slow down testing to spare him bad numbers. The campaign insists it was a joke, but when your best defense is that the president was joshing about a disease that has killed 120,000 Americans and wrecked the economy, you’re not exactly in what the pros call a messaging sweet spot.
 But, while the Trump inner circle immediately rushed to find someone to throw under the bus, one man in the far outer circle, the ousted circle to be more accurate, saw something very different. That man was former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, now back in Alabama and trying to reclaim a U.S. Senate seat after vacating his to serve in the Trump administration.
 He declared on Twitter:
 “President @realDonaldTrump displayed tonight his incredible drive, understanding of the history and principles that made America great. Masterful! Unleashed! Winning message!!
 @JoeBiden cannot match this. Game on!”

Timing is everything, which may leave the National Basketball Association with nothing.
   
 It seems only a matter of time now until the NBA cancels its plan to resume its season and then play its entire postseason in a Disney World bubble. It doesn't make sense to fly into the epicenter of a pandemic. Baseball, hockey, soccer and football teams have experienced COVID-19 outbreaks in Florida and have altered training plans accordingly.
   
 Moving to Plan B -- if there is one -- would be a more drastic step for the NBA, which may explain the league's hesitancy to make an announcement. Several veteran players have already decided not to participate, and there will be more. Some of the Toronto Raptors are training together in Fort Myers, preparing for a dubious move to Disney in two weeks.
   
 The Disney plan, born out of desperation, would have been inconceivable six months ago. It was innovative and ambitious and seemed worth a try until Gov. Ron DeSantis monkeyed it up.
   
 Yes, if we are looking for someone to blame for this disaster, it has to start there, and then we have to look in the mirror. This didn't have to happen this way. We have been negligent, and there are consequences.
   
 DeSantis has been conspicuously resistant to proven policies that would have kept the spread of COVID-19 to more manageable levels. As recently as last week, he was insisting that the recent surge in cases was due only to increased testing.
   
 DeSantis started to change his mind over the weekend when someone finally got through to him that young and middle-aged people were also getting infected at an alarming rate. This was a week after the governor of Texas had observed that the majority of people testing positive "in certain counties" was below the age of 30.
   
 A lot of us old folks understood that DeSantis had written us off, had accepted us as collateral damage in his war to get the economy back on its feet. But when the cases of 20- to 40-year-old Floridians began to surge, that's when it occurred to the governor that crowded bars, restaurants, stores, gyms and beaches might not be such a good idea yet. Maybe people should start wearing masks and maintaining social distances like they do almost everywhere else.
   
 "We're seeing it spread in 20- and 30-year-olds faster than we would like to see," DeSantis told the Orlando Sentinel, "so we really want to send a message of doubling down on what we've been preaching since the start in terms of social distancing."
   
 Hey thanks, gov, except that you really haven't been preaching that from the start, or even the middle. Quite the contrary. You were among the first to suggest that the cure (masks, social distancing, partial shutdowns) might be worse than the disease. Then, contradicting the assessments of scientists, doctors and other experts, you misled led us into believing that the viral surge was past its peak, that the worst was over, so we could come out and play. We believed you because we wanted to, and now we're paying the price.
   
 So is the NBA, which has nowhere else to go after putting all of its eggs in a Florida basket. The league's best option now might be to call off the rest of the season and come up with a realistic plan for a relatively normal 2020-21 season. The same may be true for Major League Baseball, which is still a long way from starting even a portion of a season.
   
 When the pandemic hit us in mid-March, we assumed it would be an inconvenience for a week or two. The idea that team sports played in front of large crowds might not be possible for several months, or perhaps all year, was unthinkable. But we've never had a real lockdown in Florida, the kind they have had in other states and countries, where "spike" and "hot spot" and "epicenter" aren't so much a part of the vocabulary these days.
   
 We can't have a lockdown here. People won't do it. They figure the virus is mostly in nursing homes and prisons, so they don't have to look at it or think much about it.
   
 An epidemiologist said on television recently that a strict lockdown of six weeks could have put the serious danger posed by the coronavirus in the past. I have no way of knowing whether his assessment was accurate, but let's say he was exaggerating and it would have taken 12 weeks, or even 15 weeks.
   
 That's where we are now, 15 weeks from the middle of March. Masks are now mandatory in public settings in Orlando, Tampa and Miami, but I don't see many people wearing them in Polk County.
   
 Football season is next.

 “We’ve operated under the premise that they haven’t done anything in three months,” Barnes added. “Even though I think the majority of them have done something. But we just really wanted to just get out here and see them again. Be around them. The physical aspect and the football aspect of it is secondary right now. We want to get them in a little bit of a routine, and just get to be around them and build some relationships with some of these newer guys.
 “And then the football part will come.”
 Barnes and the Tigers might not be as behind the curve as other teams, particularly when there are nine returners expected back on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball.
 Still, he knows replacing the production of guys like De’Eric Hollowell, Luke Stallins, Devin Kilgore and Ben Holt won’t be an expedient process, and it’ll take even longer than anticipated under the constrictions of the coronavirus.
 “We’ve got a good number of guys coming back, so I kind of have an idea in my head of what it’s going to look like,” Barnes said. “It’s just putting the pieces together, and that’ll come together over the next couple months and whenever we can finally get everybody out here where it looks more like a traditional football practice.
 “(But) a lot of our core guys that you’ll be reading about and watching on Friday nights, they did a good job taking it upon themselves and finding a way to make it work. A lot of them go to local gyms in town or down in Lyon County, and that wasn’t an option for them. So they had to be creative, a little bit, and do some things on their own, and you can tell that they did that.”

Shedding operating costs will remain the biggest focus area for regional banks in the next few quarters to arrest sharp decline in asset growth and profits and rising NPLs.   Responding to the slowing economies, most banks had initiated cost cutting measures even prior to COVID-19 becoming a global pandemic. During Q1 2020, cost to income C/I ratio of top 10 UAE banks improved by110 bps, after rising for the previous quarters. The lower C/I ratio was reported due to decline staff costs associated with marketing expenses by 6.8. The decline in expenses was largely on the back of cost-cutting measures adopted by the banks, as eight of the ten banks reduced their expenses.   “The impact of COVID-19 on the profitability of banks is unprecedented. There is no other option but to downsize operations and reduce cost to make businesses viable in the short to medium term. It is painful, but there are few options,” said the retail banking head of a local bank.
