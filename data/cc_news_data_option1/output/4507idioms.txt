SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Voters have ousted a Georgia prosecutor who was criticized for her office’s response to the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery. District Attorney Jackie Johnson says Arbery’s case played a large role in her defeat in the Brunswick Judicial Circuit. She lost to Keith Higgins, a former assistant prosecutor who gathered signatures to get on the ballot as an independent. Arbery was killed in February by a white father and son who pursued the young Black man as he ran in their neighborhood. The father had worked as an investigator in Johnson’s office. Johnson says some wrongly blamed her for the two-month delay before charges were levied in the case.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Opening the lid reveals a 14-inch display that comes in two flavors: Full HD and UHD (a.k.a. 4K). Lenovo sent me the model with the latter resolution, and I can confirm it’s quite stunning. Colors are vibrant, blacks are inky, and everything is crystal clear. It supports Dolby Vision HDR playback and gets up to 500 nits of brightness.

VATICAN CITY - A long-awaited Vatican report into disgraced ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick is expected to be released this month to coincide with an annual meeting of American bishops, Vatican sources said on Thursday.


  McCarrick was expelled from the Roman Catholic priesthood last year after a Vatican investigation found him guilty of sexual crimes against minors and adults and abuse of power.


  Pope Francis ordered a thorough study of all documents in Holy See offices concerning McCarrick in 2018. The four U.S. dioceses where he served - New York, Metuchen, Newark, and Washington, D.C. - carried out separate investigations to feed into the Vatican report.


  U.S. Catholic bishops are due to hold their annual meeting Nov. 15-19. It will be held virtually this year because of the coronavirus.


  The sources said the report would be released by the Vatican before the bishops' meeting starts.


  There is great anticipation for the report because it may show how McCarrick managed to rise through the ranks even though his history of sexual misconduct with adult male seminarians was an open secret.


  The 90-year-old McCarrick, once a power-broker as Archbishop of Washington, D.C. from 2001 to 2006, is the highest-profile Church figure to have been dismissed from the priesthood in modern times. (

  Still unclear is whether West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, voted for her husband. Like many celebrities, the reality TV star has been vocal about the importance of voting and sharing resources leading up to the election, but she has not endorsed any candidates.


  “I VOTED!!!! Did you?!?!” she captioned a photo of herself posing with her “I Voted” sticker Tuesday. “If you are in line when the hours of operation close at the polls, they are required to stay open and allow you to vote, so do not get out of line.”


  Many on Twitter speculated that Kardashian threw her support behind West, while others assumed she voted for Trump. The “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star has worked with the Trump administration in the past on criminal justice reform.

Because of that, the corporation now trades at a significant premium to the partnership, which could be beneficial down the road as it could use the stock as currency to fund growth initiatives like acquisitions or development projects. That additional flexibility could come in handy as more companies seek out renewable energy sources since it could allow Brookfield to meet their needs quickly.

On the other hand, at the end of the day, that might not pose too much of an issue. Just last month, Xbox chief Phil Spencer told _Kotaku_ bossman Stephen Totilo that Xbox Series S games could boast smaller file sizes than their Xbox Series X counterparts. The idea is that Series S versions of games might come packaged with lower-res textures, which would take up less space than those of the 4K Xbox Series X versions, but that’s a decision left up to the developer. And Microsoft has shown some interest in shrinking game file sizes. _Sea Of Thieves_ ’ install size was recently cut from 47GB to 25GB on Xbox One.

DXY loses further ground and returns to the 92.50 region. Biden keeps the lead vs. Trump as vote counting is underway. US Initial Claims came in at 751K during last week. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback vs. a basket of its main competitors, remains well on the defensive in the vicinity of 92.50, or 2-month lows. US Dollar Index offered on risk appetite, looks to FOMC The index accelerates the downside and tests levels last seen in mid/late-October around 92.50 against the backdrop of the solid sentiment surrounding the risk-associated complex. The upbeat note in the riskier assets comes in response to rising bets of a Biden presidency, as the Democrat candidate remains in the lead with six states still counting votes. In the US data space, weekly Claims rose by 751K, coming in short of initial expectations. Previously, Challenger Job Cuts shrunk to 80.87K in October (from 118.80K). Later in the session, the FOMC is predicted to keep the Fed Funds Target Range unchanged at 0.00%-0.25%. What to look for around USD The index failed to extend the move beyond the 94.30 area on Wednesday and instead appears to have resumed the downside towards the 93.00 level. Rising probability of a Biden presidency keeps weighing on the dollar, although prospects of a "blue wave" looks largely diminished. On the more macro view, the impact of the second wave of the pandemic on the economy could favour the re-emergence of the risk aversion and thus some support for the buck. Later in the session, the greenback should remain under the microscope in light of key data releases and the FOMC meeting. US Dollar Index relevant levels At the moment, the index is losing 0.80% at 92.72 and faces immediate contention at 92.47 (monthly low Oct.21) seconded by 91.92 (23.6% Fibo of the 2017-2018 drop) and then 91.880 (monthly low May 2018). On the other hand, a breakout of 94.30 (monthly high Nov.3) would open the door to 94.74 (monthly high Sep.25) and finally 96.03 (50% Fibo of the 2017-2018 drop).

Two other large projects that have been proposed for the Bradford side of the river include the Riverview Condominiums project at 38 Railroad St. and a 290-unit apartment complex at the site of the former Ornsteen Heel company property.


  Sal Lupoli's Heights at Haverhill project on downtown Merrimack Street also came under the city's waterfront overlay zoning, as did the boardwalk next to the Harbor Place complex, Macek said.


  "As these things start to happen, other developers will see the opportunities and be willing to get involved," Macek said. "Someone has to break the ice like the Cordovan, which heralded other housing projects in old mill buildings and created a downtown village."


  The Cordovan is a building from Haverhill's shoe-making industry which thrived generations ago. The building was the first of several vacant downtown Haverhill structures that developers converted to housing about a decade ago, boosting the economy of the city center.


  Macek said Haverhill has eight different waterfront zones along the river that provide opportunities for developers.


  "We were told for years, prior to the waterfront overlays (zones), that developers were hesitant to come to Haverhill because there was no guarantee they would get through the special permit process," Macek said. "Now with the overlays, developers have assurance that if they meet the conditions of the overlay zoning, they will be able to get approval for construction."


  Attorney Michael Migliori, representing Larvanco LLC, said the proposed First Landing condominium project at the old Skelley Motors property on Water Street would be built on a half-acre lot that contains two old buildings, broken pavement and an overgrowth of vegetation.


  The five-story project would include eight two-bedroom units and one one- bedroom unit, and have nearly double the amount of parking required by the city, Migliori said.

 Presenting the award this year was Linda Overton. Her message to the Club:
 “I have known Barbara Wheelless since the beginning of 2016 when she joined HCRW. I have enjoyed getting to know her as well as work with her through these years. Barbara hit the ground running and agreed to be our HCRW Secretary from almost the day she joined.
 “We have served together on the HCRW Board from that point forward. She did an exceptional job. I remember well the way Barbara put her own personal touch in each and every HCRW monthly newsletter during that time.

The senior has had three impressive games, making 13 tackles against Florida Atlantic, 16 against Appalachian State, and eight tackles and three fumble recoveries against Western Kentucky.

When it comes to how the console actually performs, I was quite pleased with it overall. Even after a 5-hour long session of multiple games being played, the Xbox Series X remained silent throughout. If you have any fears of the console overheating, there's really nothing to be worried about. The top portion of the machine helps push out all the hot air through vents and keeps it from exerting itself beyond its limits. The console works itself hard to provide higher frame rates, HDR compatibility, and 4K resolution for a massive library of backward/forward compatible titles. Yet it still does a fine job of staying as quiet as possible while it improves the visual fidelity and performance of your favorite games.

This is the philosophy and the idea is they want it to be that when the squad does run thin in moments like this where you get a pile-up of injuries in any given position – because there were three central midfielders not available for that game, Pritchard, Bacuna and Vallejo – the idea is that when the squad runs thin in those positions you end up with Matty Daly on the bench, or Romoney Crichlow on the bench or even in the starting lineup if it comes to that as he was against Nottingham Forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We’ve seen a lot of criticism of Richard Stearman and people saying ‘well, get Crichlow in the team’, which I think is totally unwarranted to be honest. I know he made the mistake against Norwich and the mistake against Brentford, but I reject the idea he was at fault against Bristol City … to me Stearman has been one of Town’s best players this season actually, I’d put him just behind Harry Toffolo in that regard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          But you can’t say ‘get Romoney Crichlow in the team, he did great against Forest’ and then also complain that they’ve ended up with Matty Daly in the bench for this game because you kind of can’t have it both ways. The whole idea is that if you go and sign a senior pro for the sake of filling in for these two or three games a season, if you get another Andy King just to fill a gap, you’re robbing opportunities for young players who could be at the club longer term.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The club know that is going to cause them some short-term pain, as people are arguing – and I disagree with it, but – as people are arguing happened against Bristol here.

Things are changing at Volvo Trucks' expansive lineup of heavy-duty trucks and semis. The division announced Thursday its lineup of all-electric semi trucks will launch in Europe next year as it prepares for mass production of the vehicles in 2022. With 50 tons of capacity and electric driving ranges up to an estimated 186 miles, Volvo Trucks said this is just the start of its EV revolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In the long run, Volvo Trucks plans to introduce more advanced electric semis with longer driving ranges through this decade. It also said it has plans for hydrogen fuel cells as well, which could perhaps be a thorn in the side of hydrogen truck startup Nikola. Toyota, too, plans for a fuel-cell semi. Both zero-emission powertrain technologies will help Volvo move toward a fossil-free lineup of trucks by 2040, according to the division, but the transition will be gradual, in the company's words.

Because of the more power-hungry processor and 4K screen, I’m able to achieve five to six hours of usage on a single charge. That’s not enough for a full day in my book and I suspect it’s the same for you. If you want better battery life, you have to get a model with a lower-resolution screen and something like an Intel Core i5. You’ll also have to make sure your power settings are in check. Otherwise, you’ll be looking for a charger more often than not.

The AirPods Pro have been floating at around $200 on Amazon and elsewhere, on and off, for weeks.

Standard AirPods, meanwhile, have now dropped to just $99 at Amazon, Costco and Walmart, and other retailers seem to be matching it at that price. (Best Buy's price was also briefly at $100, but has reverted back to $130 for now.)

The Quick Resume feature means that it remembers your place in a few recently played games, so you can swap between them on the fly. It feels like magic.

Let’s cut to the chase. Lil Nas X shared photos of himself dressed up for Halloween as Nicki Minaj from her music video for her song “Super Bass,” that's it.

For heaven's sake, even the name "Nas Maraj" is an homage to the female rapper who Lil Nas clearly admires; he got his start on Twitter as a Nicki super fan for crying out loud. Lil Nas has also dressed up as a vampire, so does this site believe he's now a member of the undead who lives on the blood of the living?

Seek out social support. Talk to a trusted family member, friend, community leader - or find a social support group in your area. While that may be a bit more challenging in a pandemic, with the need for social distancing, it's still possible to pick up the phone, get on a FaceTime call or set up a virtual appointment with a mental health professional. But also remember Goldilocks' rule: Social isolation intensifies negative feelings, but so does spending too much time talking about problems.

Italy's newly-designated coronavirus "red zones" braced Thursday for a fresh lockdown as anger rose against the government, accused of penalising some regions while being too lax towards others.


  At the Scala in Milan, gloom reigned after the prestigious opera house was forced to cancel its opening night next month, and non-essential shops served their last customers before a lockdown Friday set to affect over 16 million people.


  Lombardy, which includes Milan, was designated "high-risk" this week, along with fellow northern regions Piedmont and Val d'Aosta, and Calabria in the south, under a new colour-coded scheme drawn up by Rome.


  Southern regions Puglia and Sicily were designated orange, or medium-risk, and will face less restrictive measures, while the rest of Italy was yellow. All of Italy is facing a new night curfew from Friday.


  "It's a slap in the face for Lombardy," raged the region's president Attilio Fontana, a member of the far-right opposition League party, who has accused Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of using out of date data.


  Some on the already quiet streets of Milan, Italy's financial and fashion capital, said a new lockdown would change little.


  "My customers are very scared, very scared," hairdresser Francesco Puccio told AFP.


  "Last week I only had two clients per day, sometimes even just one, so there's no real advantage for me in staying open. There's nobody out and about anymore, the offices are empty," he said.


  In Rome, lawyer Barbara Ferretti, 53, said she was "ready to do whatever it takes to get back to normal life as soon as possible".

New US jobless claim data released Thursday showed little improvement in the week before President Donald Trump stood for reelection against challenger Joe Biden, indicating widespread unemployment persists months after business shutdowns to stop Covid-19 began.

Jobless claims spiked into the millions beginning in March after businesses began shutting down to stop Covid-19 from spreading, and while they've since dropped dramatically, the latest reading remains above the worst single week of the 2008-2010 global financial crisis.

As Covid-19 cases surge across the nation, analysts warn of a deteriorating economic situation as the year draws to a close.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The labor market remains under stress from an elevated pace of layoffs," Rubeela Farooqi of High Frequency Economics said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     "A resurgence in virus cases that will result in business closures and job losses will further damage the labor market and will slow the pace of rebound going forward."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The data showed an additional 362,883 people, not seasonally adjusted, filing under a special program for workers not normally eligible for aid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     All told, more than 21.5 million people were receiving government benefits as of the week ended October 17, the latest week for which data was available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The data also showed the number of people receiving benefits under the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program designed for long-term joblessness rising by 277,564 to nearly four million, indicating many people were having trouble finding work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The data was released one day after the United States reported more than 99,000 new coronavirus cases, worsening what is already the world's largest outbreak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Also worrying analysts is Congress's failure to pass another spending package to bolster the economy's recovery, with the expanded unemployment programs set to lapse at the end of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "The initial unemployment number not falling as much as expected is just the tip of the iceberg, as the economy's ability to add jobs and keep people off assistance is quickly weakening," Robert Frick of Navy Federal Credit Union said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "More stimulus is needed to help these Americans and keep the unemployment numbers from starting to rise."

_Gone With the Wind_ was also the subject of a fight over representation and so-called cancel culture when HBO Max briefly removed it from its catalogue in June at the urging of Oscar-winning screenwriter John Ridley. A backlash ensued, and HBO Max restored it with a disclaimer acknowledging that "the film’s treatment of this world through a lens of nostalgia denies the horrors of slavery, as well as its legacies of racial inequality."

And the sale of their mystery boxes, costing from $30 to $200, is now a social media phenomenon.
 Customers have included relatives of the blind, among them parents with vision impaired children; some have posted unboxing videos on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, with a few opening boxes blindfolded.
 The brothers hit on the idea in 2015, when a gene therapy discovered by an underfunded researcher for an unrelated juvenile eye disease was about to hit the market.
 “It was mind boggling to us,” Bryan said. “Our whole lives they were like, `Oh, a cure is down the line, a cure is down the line.’ This one isn’t for us, but it is happening, and the Foundation Fighting Blindness kicked this off with just a tiny charitable gift to this brilliant researcher.”
 Soon after, they were separated while shopping at Bloomingdale’s. When they reconnected, they found that they had purchased the same soft shirt.
 “It was the feel of it. It felt so soft and comfortable that we both keyed upon it, and then we had this idea, well what if we could take this sense of touch to a different place, make super comfortable clothing” and turn over the profits to researchers at work on eye diseases, Bryan said.

TOKYO - The dollar slipped to its weakest level in more than two years against the yuan and eased against other Asian currencies as Democrat Joe Biden edged closer to the White House in a nail-biting U.S. presidential election.


  Financial markets, however, were braced for days or even weeks of uncertainty as Republican incumbent President Donald Trump has opened a multi-pronged attack on vote counts in several states by pursuing lawsuits and a recount. That could hamper the dollar in the short run, traders say.


  Elsewhere, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro after a media report that the Bank of England, which announces a policy decision later on Thursday, is considering negative interest rates.


  The Federal Reserve, which is expected to keep policy on hold on Thursday, is also in focus as traders navigate market volatility in the wake of a knife- edge U.S. election that has pushed up the yuan and the Mexican peso.


  Biden has claimed the pivotal Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Michigan. Late reporting showed the former vice president with a lead in Nevada and Arizona, while Trump held a lead in Georgia and Pennsylvania. Expectations that a Biden administration would strike a slightly softer tone on trade policy is likely to weaken the dollar against the currencies of countries that often faced the threat of tariffs during Trump's administration, analysts said.


  "The moves in the yuan and the peso show that the market is trying to price in a Biden victory," said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. "For slightly different reasons, we could also see the euro gain against the dollar."


  The onshore yuan briefly rose to over a two-year high of 6.6381 per dollar, extending its recent gains as China's currency has become a popular trade to bet on a Biden victory.


  Emerging market currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and the Indonesian rupiah also rose against the greenback.


  The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 93.350, little changed from the previous session. The euro bought $1.1736 on Thursday, steady from the previous session. The British pound fell 0.25% to $1.2960.


  Against the euro, the pound fell 0.33% to 90.55 pence. The dollar was little changed at 104.33 yen. Even if Biden manages to surmount the legal challenges from Trump to become the next president, Republicans look likely to retain control of the Senate and can use that to stymie Biden's agenda - another complicating factor for currency traders.


  Some analysts said Republican control of the Senate would prevent a Biden government from raising corporate taxes, which is positive for equities. However, a divided government also decreases the chances of big fiscal stimulus, which could be seen as a negative, other analysts said. The Mexican peso, which had taken a hammering from the Trump administration's hard line on trade, was little changed at 20.96 per dollar following a 0.9% gain on Wednesday.

First, there's _Sea of Thieves_ , which now runs at consistent 4K and 60fps. While _Sea of Thieves_ looks great -- especially that 4K water -- the difference in my experience playing the game on the Xbox One X compared to the Series X is negligible.

But at some point, we have to put the outcome behind us, and the best place to start is to mend fences with your family and friends, some of whom might fall into the former category at the moment.


  Few matters, including an election, are so vital as to draw a permanent wedge between parents and their children, siblings or a lifelong buddy. You knew these people long before either Trump or Biden pursued the presidency.


  There’s no time like the present and immediate future to begin this reconciliation process. The COVID-19 pandemic will make gatherings more complicated, but Thanksgiving and Christmas are just around the corner. Let us heal during the holidays.

Back in Illinois for the winter months are the white-throated sparrows, a large and attractive bird with a long tail and a bright, white throat and bold face patterns of black, white, gray and yellow. The white-throated sparrows are considered a short to medium-distance migrant.


  It breeds in the United States in the Upper Great Lake region and in the coniferous and mixed forests across most of Canada.


  There are small pockets of year-round birds in the northeast U.S. The sparrows leave the impending harsh winter of the north in autumn before the first snow and head south into the U.S. to a more hospitable climate that is not totally locked in ice during those cold months.

It's super disappointing to see Master Chief on the back of the console packaging and not be able to play his latest series entry on day one. And the fact that Microsoft acquired all those first-party studios and still have nothing to offer from any of them in 2020 is a massive gut punch. It's pretty wild to look back at the Xbox One's launch day games and see just how much better they are than this one. Playing Xbox Series X enhanced experiences is cool and all. But not having heavy hitters on day one, such as _Halo Infinite_ , a new _Killer Instinct_ , _Forza Motorsport_ , a sequel to _Ryse: Son of Rome_ , etc. puts a damper on this console's initial offering of games.

Many pollsters, except Robert Cahally, who also solely and correctly predicted the outcome of the 2016 presidential elections, thought that the 2020 elections would be a landslide for Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his allies in the House and Senate.


  That has not been the case at all as both candidates are currently fighting a close battle for every single electoral college vote across the country's battleground states. Much to the dismay of liberal pundits, President Donald Trump increased his share of votes across the country.


  All of these make it clear that if the deadly pandemic had not hit the world, particularly, the US, killing more than 200,000 there and leading to an economic recession, Trump might have won the elections in a big way.


  Trump has continuously downplayed the significance and deadly consequences of Covid-19, but the pandemic has proven to potentially be the president's Achilles' heel.


  "Flu season is coming up! Many people every year, sometimes over 100,000, and despite the Vaccine, die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country?" wrote the president in a post on both Twitter and Facebook, which removed the statement on the grounds that it was factually incorrect.  

  "No, we have learned to live with it, just like we are learning to live with Covid, in most populations far less lethal!!!" he continued.


  Current American deaths from Covid-19 are estimated to be ten times more than deaths from the seasonal flu last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


  But no matter which is deadlier, if Trump loses, it is crystal clear that the pandemic has had a deadly effect on his chances to win the election.


  Covid-19 affected rich and poor alike, and Trump himself, last month.

They want to attract academy players who slip the cracks at other clubs, and if they have that reputation it allows them to get better and better players year on year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         … So I understand the philosophy behind it. Whether you think it’s right or wrong is entirely up to you, but that’s the thinking behind it, and it’s not just a case of…I mean they have said they want to save the money, but the reason they feel like they can save the money is because this system is in place and they believe this is the best way to go for the longer-term future.

In the race to find the data storage medium of the future, glass is another material in the running. Microsoft’s Project Silica, for example, is a proof of concept that uses quartz glass as a storage medium. Lasers permanently change the structure of glass, making it possible to store data that can then be read by machine learning algorithms. By taking up a fraction of the space, and not requiring the climate-controlled storage or other regular maintenance of typical storage mediums, it holds immense promise for archiving and backup activity.

Since March, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every part of our lives. The ones most hurt during the pandemic have been America’s small employers. Each month, more and more small businesses have shut their doors because of lack of income. As a small business owner, I have seen it personally.


  We finally are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Businesses have been getting back on their feet the past few months and bringing employees back to work so they can earn a wage and provide for their families. This should be a turning point for small businesses in Illinois. However, our small businesses now face a new threat.


  Gov. JB Pritzker has proposed a progressive tax and other costs that will devastate businesses and their employees. As a small business owner in Wauconda, I cannot emphasize how bad these policies will be for employers in Illinois. Any profit we are able to make right now would be paid right back in taxes, and this extra cost could shut us down permanently. In the middle of a pandemic -- while small businesses still are closed or have fewer customers -- Illinois lawmakers want to cause more problems for businesses in our state, and it makes no sense.

There are also some issues evident in the battle system that regularly impact the flow of each fight. Most notably, the automatic pathfinding of each of your party members is often unreliable, particularly indoors or when there are a number of objects to navigate around. In those scenarios, I’d often select an attack and then watch as my character got stuck in a wall for a while before teleporting to their target. This can be especially annoying when you’ve strategically waited for a group of enemies to move into a tight bunch in order to unleash an attack with a wide area of effect, like Kasuga’s bat- swinging Giga Smash, only for the group to have dispersed by the time your dawdling character manages to make their way over to the target.

When the Xbox Series S was first (officially) revealed in September, the general consensus could be summed up as such: “Aww!!” That’s not just a remark on the next-gen console’s diminutive physical size (and cheaper price, $US300 ($419) compared with the Xbox Series X’s $US500 ($698)). That could have also been commentary on the internal storage, which clocks in, on paper, at an adorable 512 GB. Too bad you can only use 364 GB of that in the real world.

Python’s convenience and versatility mean that it’s used to build software in nearly every walk of IT life. One major niche is web services, where Python’s speed of development and flexible metaphors make it easy to get websites up and running quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    And just as you might guess, Python gives you plenty of choices and latitude in web frameworks, both small and large. After all, not every web project needs to be enterprise-scale.

As the famous Greek philosopher, Aristotle once said," Man is a social animal by nature." We cannot survive alone, all by ourselves. Therefore, there is no harm in asking for help. It is very natural for us to have a breakdown once in a while. Humans go through a rush of emotions daily. Therefore, when you experience panic or an overwhelming situation. Try asking for help. We all need help once in a while. Your friends and family can offer their support by hearing you out, listening to all your problems and queries, or by providing you with practical help. Local services are also present to assist you in your time of need.

There's real convergence. Malcolm converges with BLM in terms of BLM's structural criticism of systems. BLM is making the argument that the criminal justice system represents a gateway to panoramic systems of oppression, and Malcolm made similar structural criticism. [Like King,] they've really been about civil disobedience. Their demonstrations have been nonviolent by and large, and in a lot of ways, they follow King. When you read a Movement for Black Lives' policy agenda, they're looking for a beloved community, and even more so than King, they're giving you a detailed road map on how to get there.

Miami Central began its season less than two weeks ago with its annual clash against Northwestern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was a game befitting the rivalry, even after both teams went more than 10 months without playing a real game because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Central had two chances in the red zone in the final five minutes and the Bulls made a pair of stops to secure a seven-point win in a clash between reigning state champions in Miami.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Rockets followed up their high-profile opener with a regular-season finale Friday and it only lasted two quarters because of lightning n the area. Now, just two weeks after their 2020 season began, the postseason is here.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia says it will host a Formula One race starting next year. The move is aimed at attracting well-heeled globe-trotting visitors and raising the kingdom’s profile internationally as a tourist destination. The kingdom says it will host the race in November 2021 in the Red Sea city of Jiddah. The country will use scenic roads along the coast. It plans to build a race track in Riyadh by 2030. That suggests there could be a long-term contract. The announcement comes as rights groups say Saudi Arabia could be using sports to rehabilitate its image amid a widening crackdown on human rights.

The last time Horicon/Hustisford took the field, the weather was wintry. The next time the MarshFalcons line up on the gridiron, conditions will be almost summery.
 And it’s only been two weeks.
 Welcome to Wisconsin in the fall.
 The MarshFalcons are coming off a one-week layoff due to COVID-19 and head to Pardeeville on Friday — when the forecast is for a high temperature in the mid-60s and a low in the low-50s — for the final week of the regular season. On paper, the two teams have a combined record of 1-5, but despite the lack of wins between them, it figures to be a highly competitive contest.

Today, over 1,000 people are employed through Anagnost Investments, the parent to over a dozen enterprises scattered throughout the Northeast and Mid- Atlantic states.


  But that doesn’t mean there weren’t some hard knocks along the way.


  Anagnost credits his success to having the right business partners along the way and creating an environment where there is little leadership turnover.


  “We put people in positions to succeed, and we utilize their skills that are key to all of our successes by putting them in those positions,” Anagnost said.


  His words of advice for people who want to be successful in the business world? Have financial discipline, be flexible and go to work.


  “I like to joke with my wife, and she gets very angry, that the business is my wife and that she is my mistress, and that’s why we have such a great relationship. But literally, when you’re in business and you are the owner of a business, you’re married to that business,” Anagnost said.


  Anagnost lives in Bedford with his wife, Demetria. They have three sons, Alexander, Stavros and Demetri.


  All three Anagnost children are involved in the family business.

The heavily offered tone surrounding the USD assisted gold to gain strong traction on Thursday. Technical buying above the $1920 resistance provided an additional boost to the precious metal. Investors look forward to the FOMC policy decision for some meaningful trading opportunities. Gold continued gaining altitude through the early North American session and shot to over three-week tops, around the $1930-32 supply zone in the last hour. The precious metal gained some strong traction on Thursday and built on its recent strong rebound from one-month lows, around the $1860 region touched last Thursday. The US dollar slumped across the board on the back of the uncertain US political situation, which, in turn, was seen as one of the key factors that benefitted the dollar-denominated commodity. Democrat Joe Biden appeared to be on track for a victory in the nail-biting US presidential election. However, neither candidate, so far, has the required 270 Electoral College votes to win the White House. Moreover, Republican incumbent President Donald Trump has threatened to undermine the victory by challenging its legality in court. The heightened uncertainty continued weighing heavily on the buck, which, along with a softer tone surrounding the US Treasury bond yields drove flows towards the non-yielding yellow metal. The strong intraday positive move seemed rather unaffected by indications of yet another strong opening in the US equity markets, which tends to undermine the safe-haven precious metal. Apart from this, possibilities of some short-term trading stops being triggered above the overnight swing highs, and a subsequent move beyond the $1920 level might have provided an additional boost to the XAU/USD. Some follow-through buying beyond October monthly swing highs resistance near the $1930-32 region should pave the way for additional near-term gains. Moving ahead, market participants now look forward to the latest FOMC monetary policy decision, scheduled to be announced later during the US session. This, along with US political developments and the broader market risk sentiment, will play a key role in influencing the XAU/USD and assist traders to grab some short-term opportunities.

You will have to do a few things to prepare your X570 or B550 motherboard first, though. AMD official said for any 500-series AM4 motherboard to boot a new “Zen 3” Ryzen 5000 chip, it’ll have to have a UEFI/BIOS featuring an AMD AGESA BIOS numbered 1.0.8.0 or higher.


  You can head over to your motherboard maker’s website and search the support section for the BIOS for your board. For example, for this Asus Prime X570P, we found that Asus currently has a BIOS/UEFI version of 2606 on its website that was released in August of 2019.

One of the key factors behind the Xbox Series X's ability to load games quickly is its custom NVME SSD. Across the board, the console loads games extremely fast. For example, I was able to jump into titles with previously long load times like _Gears 5_ , _Assassin 's Creed Odysse_y and _State of Decay 2_ in nearly half the time in most cases thanks to the next-gen console's faster SSD.

Suburban services will be resumed in West Bengal from November 11, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said on Thursday. “With adequate safety measures in place, this will enhance passenger convenience and facilitate smooth travel for the people,” Mr. Goyal said on social media.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The announcement comes after a series of meetings between the Railway officials and the State government officials over the past few days. The services have been suspended for more than seven months due to the pandemic. Over the past few weeks, protests had erupted at various places in the suburbs which led to the meetings on the resumption of train services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A detailed standard operating procedure on the running of trains will be announced on November 9. Trains will be run as per the existing time table. It was suggested that only 10 to 15% trains will run but during the meeting it was decided that a higher number will have to be run for crowd control and to maintain the health protocol. The services will run in all the three divisions — 100 in the Howrah division, 34 in the Kharagpur division and 224 in the Sealdah division.

Ever since Trump's announcement that the court would stop the counting, observers have wondered how this should work. And with what justification. Each of the 50 states determines the procedures for the election and the count itself. To go to court, Trump's lawyers would have to prove a violation of the respective rules. As a rule, this only happens after the official result has been announced in the state. An interruption of the count is unlikely to be achieved in this way.

  # Swedish PM self-isolates as nation passes grim threshold


  Jan M. Olsen


  Associated Press


  View Comments


  _Copenhagen, Denmark_ – Sweden’s prime minister has gone into protective self-isolation after a person close to him came into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, as Sweden experiences a fall surge of coronavirus infections.


  Stefan Lofven broke the news on Facebook on Thursday, when the Scandinavian country passed the threshold of 6,000 overall coronavirus deaths.


  “The developments are going in the wrong direction fast. More are infected. More die. This is a serious situation,” he wrote.


  “On the doctor’s advice, my wife Ulla and I will stay isolated for the time being,” Lofven wrote. “We are fine and have no symptoms. In accordance with recommendations from health officials, we will take a coronavirus test as soon as possible.”


  “This is the only responsible thing to do in this situation,” he added, saying the person close to him had been in contact with another person who had tested positive.


  Earlier this year, when European nations locked down to fight the virus, Sweden drew worldwide attention by keeping schools, gyms and restaurants open and not requiring people to wear masks. But now that daily new infections are on the rise again, Swedes may not have had much practice in making sacrifices for the national good.


  In recent weeks, the government has ruled that a maximum of eight people can be seated at a restaurant together. It has also rolled out local restrictions – urging people to avoid crowded places, avoid public transportation and work from home if possible – that now affect seven in 10 Swedes.


  “The Swedish population must understand that what happens in Europe, can, of course, also happen here. We see an increase (in new cases) that we must deal with,” Health Minister Lena Hallgren said. “Now what is important is to understand what the purpose is … which is to stop a pandemic.”

  At first, the Nordic country of 10 million people had some of the lowest numbers of new coronavirus cases. However, the latest figures tell a different story.


  For the week beginning Oct. 19, Sweden reported 9,165 new infections, an increase of 63% compared to the previous week and the highest number of cases seen so far in one week, according to Sweden’s Public Health Agency.


  Overall, Sweden reported another 4,034 infections Thursday, and 141,764 in total, and five more deaths that brought the overall toll to 6,002.


  In comparison, neighboring Denmark has had 50,530 cases and 729 deaths and Norway, which shares a more than 1,600-kilometer (994-mile) border with Sweden, has recorded 21,954 cases and only 282 deaths.


  As to the two-week cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000, Sweden has 293, Denmark 233 and Norway 97.3. The corresponding number of deaths is 0.7 in Sweden and Denmark, and 0.1 in Norway.


  Experts say all reported numbers understate the true toll of the pandemic, due to missed cases, limited testing and other factors.

A magnetar is a type of isolated neutron star, the crushed, city-size remains of a star many times more massive than our Sun. What makes a magnetar so special is its intense magnetic field. The field can be 10 trillion times stronger than a refrigerator magnet's and up to a thousand times stronger than a typical neutron star's. This represents an enormous storehouse of energy that astronomers suspect powers magnetar outbursts.

The Dryden Town Council continued the public hearing on the proposed solar development along 2150 Dryden Road prior to the planning board meeting on Oct. 22 where more public backlash was given towards the amendments to the project’s site plan.
 The project was originally submitted by Distributed Sun LLC in 2017 and was approved by the council that same year. However, Distributed Sun is no longer the developer of the project as True Green Capital is the current developer of the project, and is now proposing the entire development be built above ground, instead of underground, with overhead lining poles throughout the site connecting to the grid.
 The primary reason for why members of the community are displeased with the current site plan is the fact that it would no longer be built underground, which was something that was already approved by the council when it passed the original site plan in 2017, and the overhead lining will worsen the aesthetics of the site. At this past Thursday’s meeting, though, resident Craig Schutt brought up the fact that the town’s conservation board still has not been given access to view the southside of Virgil Creek to see what the developer is planning to do with that particular area.
 “I don’t know why [True Green] won’t allow that,” Schutt said. “What’s the problem with giving us a site visit for 15 or 20 minutes there? Why can’t we do that? It’s always the same thing that there’s no reason and everything is alright. How do you know everything is alright? I’ve asked over and over and over again for access to that site and everybody just ignores me. I’m getting a little tired of it. It makes me doubt, question more and more what is really going to happen.”
 Director of Planning Ray Burger responded by saying that both of the town’s code enforcement officers visited the site and said they saw that the Willow Glen tributary, which is south of Virgil Creek, has only been changed slightly.
 “The one change that I think may be very physical is that originally there was a farmer road – a tractor crossing – of Willow Glen Creek, and we were allowing the contractor of the original site plan to drive right on that same road,” Burger said. “Well, in order to protect the creek more and prevent any sediment from getting in the creek, they actually put in a culvert there. So there is a spot there – there’s a 20-feet culvert, and that is probably the part that is being viewed as where they straighten the creek.”

The case of Guido M. from Berlin shows that these - apart from the mentioned threats - can be long lasting. The "lateral thinking" initiative now offers T-shirts featuring the somewhat estranged portrait of the Berlin police officer in its online store. The corona skeptics have apparently still not gotten over the fact that M. has not entered history as a "hero" in their sense and that he has lost his supposed "chance". On the black T-shirts, police officer M. is mocked with the words “Be a hero. Do the right thing! Thank you".

Chairman Garlick has not spoken publicly about the situation and the club are knocking back interview requests from LancsLive and other media outlets to speak to the chairman or CEO Neil Hart about the overall situation at the club, from the transfer window to the takeover.


  The fear from a club perspective is that the longer talks drag on and the longer results suffer on the pitch, the less attractive a proposition the Clarets become and a deal might be harder to broker.


  With the January transfer window under two months away and Burnley clearly in need of new signings, a resolution by the end of this month is crucial if the prospective new owners are to hit the ground running.


  Both want to be in place by then to ensure the best possible chance of improving the playing squad in the transfer market and both are keen to retain the services of manager Sean Dyche, seen as the jewel in the Clarets crown.

As of Wednesday afternoon, we still don’t know who will be elected the next president of the United States.


  But we definitely know who won’t be: Kanye West.


  After trailing President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden by tens of millions of votes, the rapper conceded defeat Tuesday night — and announced plans to run again in the future. West appeared on the ballot in a dozen states as an independent after launching a last-minute campaign over the summer.


  “WELP,” the “Stronger” hitmaker tweeted, along with a photo of himself standing in front of a red and blue election map. “KANYE 2024.”

The Democrats candidate for president, Joe Biden, said he came up with a plan to fight the virus, only problem with his _“plan”_ was that what he proposed was what Trump was doing all along. In fact, the major decision Trump made was to close travel from China _(a move that Dr. Fauci said saved many thousands of American citizens lives),_ at the end of January. And in addition, a few weeks later, Trump stopped travel from Europe who were experiencing a high degree of infections. Joe Biden and the Democrats charged Trump with xenophobia, bigotry, and racism, the standard slurs used by the Democrats for the past 4 years, a charge totally unfounded and which was spoken with venom by them on an almost daily basis.

The sixth seed raced to a 6-1, 6-1 victory in only an hour and will face third seed Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals on Friday after the Russian's 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 win over Australia's Alex de Minaur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Schwartzman will qualify for the Tour Finals if he wins that match or if Pablo Carreno Busta does not take the title.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    "Tomorrow (Friday) is going to be a different match and it will be tough because I want to be in London," said Schwartzman.

The 28-year-old broke five times and saved the four break points he faced, which all came in the opening game of the match.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Medvedev battled back from a set down to see off US Open quarter-finalist De Minaur and reach the last eight for the first time.

The winner of Schwartzman and Medvedev could face Milos Raonic in the semis, after the Canadian saw off American world number 91 Marcos Giron 7-6 (7/1), 6-1.

My review unit also came with 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM along with a 512GB PCIe SSD for storage. These two factors play a huge role in the juggling of tasks on the X1 Yoga. Opening apps and documents are quick operations thanks to the speedy SSD and keeping a ton of stuff open at once is a breeze thanks to the extra RAM. I’m a firm believer in getting 16GB of RAM instead of eight, especially if you plan on having your computer for 3+ years down the road.

Yes and no. It's worth picking up if you're looking to move past the days of long load times and games hampered by a lower frame rate output. Once you've experienced everything the Xbox Series X can do, it's hard to go back to your again Xbox One hardware.

Si ha la netta sensazione che, stavolta, la Calabria voglia davvero alzare la testa e scendere in piazza, scuotendosi una volta per tutte e facendosi rispettare come forse mai è avvenuto prima d’ora: si parte da Siderno per una “nuova primavera”, ci sarà un seguito a tutto ciò? Di certo il rosso del peperoncino, della ‘nduja, della soppressata e del vino, il buon vino di Calabria sì, ma quello proposto dal Governo Conte no, proprio no!, _“quello ci è davvero indigesto!”_ – concludono i commercianti sidernesi.
