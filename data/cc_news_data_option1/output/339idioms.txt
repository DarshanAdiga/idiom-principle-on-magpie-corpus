5G support that doesn't break the bank
 Foldable phones are extremely expensive -- even the smaller, simpler Motorola Razr will cost $1,500 when it goes on sale. But support for 5G data, a must for premium phones in 2020, will bump up the price even more. Paying a compounded premium for both foldable and 5G would be a hard pill for the average consumer to swallow.
 For foldable phones to succeed, they need to be affordable enough for more people beyond early adopters to buy. It'll take time, but if we see a competent sub-$1,000 foldable phone go on sale by the end of 2020 (this $350 model has ambitious goals), there will at least be a blueprint to follow.

ST. BONAVENTURE -- Again playing without sophomore center Osun Osunniyi, St. Bonaventure battled one of Atlantic 10's top teams in Rhode Island to the wire Saturday afternoon in front of a sold out Reilly Center. In the end, though, the Rams threw the final blow to take an 81-75 victory.
   
 The contest saw just six lead changes and four ties, though it felt like the momentum swung many more times.
   
 Bona took a 40-35 edge to intermission after leading for 14 minutes of the opening half.
   
 Early on, the Bonnies were hot from distance, sinking five of their nine attempts from beyond the arc before intermission including a trio of treys from Alejandro Vasquez.
   
 The Rams (14-5, 6-1 A-10) took the momentum out of the break, however, posting the first seven points of the second half to surge ahead.
   
 "I thought it was an inspired effort by our guys. I thought it was a good college basketball game," said Bona coach Mark Schmidt. "We made some inexperienced plays. I thought the game was decided in the first four minutes of the second half. We came out a little bit lethargic, and they came after us.
   
 "We knew they were going to come at us. We didn't do a good job in those first four minutes, and it was back and forth. I thought Martin and Russell hit some big shots, and we missed five foul shots in the second half. With an inexperienced team, you have to make those. You're not going to make every foul shot, but with where we're at right now, we have to make those foul shots. We made some mistakes. We have to make Rhode Island earn baskets, and sometimes we broke down. But I thought the effort was there for the most part, we just have to execute better. With a young team, I think the more they are put in these different situations, hopefully they can grow and learn from them."
   
 Justin Winston pushed the Bonnies back in front with a three, 47-45, but Rhody free throws and Fatts Russell three put the visitors in the lead.
   
 That would set the stage for how things would go down the stretch. Each time the Bonnies would seemingly be poised to tie or take the lead again, either Russell or Tyrese Martin would step up with a shot to quiet the raucous Reilly Center crowd.
   
 With the Rams ahead by five with 7:21 to play, 63-58, but Martin drilled a three on the trip down the court.
   
 The Bonnies came back again on a drive of the lane by Jaren English and another three from Winston, 69-66, but a jumper from Martin made it a two possession game again followed by a Russell trey.
   
 Bona got within four, 75-71, following back-to-back buckets from Lofton with a minute to go, but a dunk from Jacob Toppin effectively put the game on ice.
   
 Five Bonnies finished in double figures led by Lofton's 15 points while Dominick Welch and Jaren English each had 14 points while freshmen Justin Winston (12) and Alejandro Vasquez (11) did as well.
   
 Russell paced all scorers with 29 points while Martin added 11. Cyril Langevine posted a double-double of 13 points and 11 rebounds.
   
 "Rhode Island is one of the elite teams in our league, and we're right there with a chance to win. That's a good sign," Schmidt said. "I was excited about the effort, it was a great crowd, much appreciated. We showed some promise, we just have to continue to work and learn from some of the breakdowns we had."
   
 GAME NOTES
   
 Rhode Island shot 51 percent in the second half (15-29) and 47 percent for the game. The Bonnies finished at 46 percent for the game.
   
 The Rams led on the boards, 35-31.
   
 Lofton shot 7-for-12 from the floor while Vasquez went 4-for-7.
   
 Lofton played the entire 40 minutes. He has played 36 or more minutes in 41 of 54 career games.
   
 English entered the game averaging a team-best 15.0 points per game in Atlantic 10 play.
   
 Amadi Ikpeze had a career-high 11 rebounds including five on the offensive glass.

Ann Elizabeth (Kokott) Brasile, 87, of Latrobe, passed peacefully at home Friday, Jan. 24, 2020. Known also as "Annie" or "Annaliese," she was born March 19, 1932, in Bad Kreuznach, Germany, and raised in the loving home of her parents, Joseph and Katherine (Kaul) Kokott in Russelsheim, Germany. She survived the war with her six siblings, Gertrude, Margaret, Willie, Erma, Katherine "Katie," and Joseph "Jupp," most of whom she has now been reunited with. She was a phenomenal wife to her late husband, Joseph Brasile; an outstanding, selfless mother to her six children, Rosemary Ejabat, Angela Brasile and former husband, David Ervin, Louis Brasile and wife, Pearl, Terese Brasile and lifelong partner, James Braden, Gino Brasile and wife, Beverly, and Francis Brasile and wife, Marsha; lastly, an incredible Oma to her nine beloved grandchildren, Terra Brasile, Michael Brasile, Salomeh Ejabat, Ashlee Ejabat, Alicia Chapa, Erik Brasile, Celeste Kepple, Cierra Brasile, and Emma Brasile; in addition to her great- and great-great-grandchildren. She endured many hardships and challenges throughout her life, always pulling through with a twinkle in her eye and a smile. She exemplified all a Christian should be, and was considered an angel on this earth by most. She was admired for many great qualities: loving, kind, hardworking, resilient, strong, and forgiving, just to a name a few. As a nurse's aide at Latrobe Hospital for 30-plus years, a German immigrant, and a parishioner of Saint John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church, she took pride in all that she did. She enjoyed dancing, children, especially infants, dogs, music, Pittsburgh Pens, Steelers, the World Cup, and of course, cooking and cleaning. Most of all, she loved spending time with family and friends. She was an amazing woman who never stopped giving her best and lived life to its fullest. She was a light to this world that was brighter than her blue eyes. She was loved dearly and will be missed always. Her motto in life was to "keep going," which inspired her license plate "Oma on the run." This is very similar to the sentiment of a local German monk, Archabbot Boniface Wimmer, O.S.B., as he said, "Forward, always forward, everywhere forward! We must not be held back by debts, bad years, or difficulties of the times. Man's adversity is God's opportunity." She was always moving onward, no matter the obstacle. Now, for the last time, she has moved onward into the kingdom of God. Ann's family would like to extend thanks to Heartland Hospice for their compassionate care provided in her time of need.   Services and interment will be private. The HARTMAN-GRAZIANO FUNERAL HOME INC. in Latrobe has been entrusted with the arrangements.   In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made, in memory of Ann, to

  A lot can change in 10 years. In 2010, Apple introduced the iPad, I didn't have grandkids and the population of Arkansas was less than 3 million. Now, tablets are as important as pencils and I have four grandchildren who are part of an estimated 100,000 additional people in Arkansas.


  Recognizing and analyzing these trends is critical as our state plans for the future. When you think about paving roads, building schools and having enough hospitals, it is important to keep that degree of population growth -- and potential future additions -- in mind.


  Although they could not have imagined the growth of America over the last 244 years, our Founding Fathers did understand the importance of counting our people to make sure we are properly represented in Congress. The U.S. Census occurs every ten years and is mandated by our Constitution. In addition to determining the distribution of billions of federal dollars, it impacts how lines are drawn for congressional districts and the number of U.S. Representatives serving each state.


  Since the first census in 1790, a lot has changed in how we collect data and what information is sought. There are several new things about the 2020 Census, including the role of technology. For the first time, many Americans will submit their information online. For Arkansans who do not have access to a computer or simply prefer to use paper forms, we all still have the option of completing our civic duty on paper, over the phone or in person with a Census official. However, for those who hope to get it done faster, the online option will be the easiest. In fact, households that reply online after receiving the first notices in March won't have to worry about additional mail, calls or visits by Census employees.


  The importance of getting an accurate count is reflected in the work of statewide initiatives like Arkansas Counts and the creation of the Arkansas Complete Count Committee. Governor Hutchinson launched this committee last summer to promote participation and provide suggestions on how to reach hard- to-count communities.


  According to U.S. Census Bureau data, 15% of Arkansans are considered hard- to-count. The agency says some of the difficult-to-count populations include low-income individuals, non-English speakers and minorities. That makes the work of the committee so crucial. I am grateful for the hard work of this committee, under the leadership of Fort Smith Mayor George McGill.


  In 2010, Arkansas ranked 38th in Census participation. This means we left billions of dollars on the table that could have been used for critical projects like highway construction, rural broadband and water systems. It is important that we all do our part this year to make sure our fair share of funding stays in the Natural State.


  The initial letters from the Census Bureau will start arriving in March 2020, with the entire process completed by fall. It is time for us all to be counted, including my grandchildren.

FAYETTEVILLE -- Robert Moore, son of Kansas City Royals general manager Dayton Moore and the first December high school graduate reporting in January to Dave Van Horn in Van Horn's 17 years coaching the Hogs, already so impresses the Arkansas staff he opens the official Jan. 25 start of preseason practice as the likely starting second baseman. So likely is Moore, everyone's high school All-American out of Leawood, Kan. and Shawnee Mission East High without playing his senior school season, that sophomore Jacob Nesbit, the 2019 third baseman moved to second last fall, likely plays third again.


  "Pretty much what I thought," Van Horn said of his first impressions of Moore. "A very steady defender. He looks like he belongs. I think the players kind of get it now that they've seen him play that he can definitely help us."


  They know Nesbit helps at third.


  "If you look at his stats last year it is incredible," Van Horn said. "The kid made four errors at third base all year which is unheard of. And he made some great plays."


  Cole Austin, the graduate transfer via Arizona State who practiced last fall at third, becomes the leading first base candidate.


  Matt Goodheart of Magnolia, All-SEC as a DH last year, likely DH's again. Goodheart wants to play first but recent shoulder surgery hampers his throwing but not hitting. So at least at the season's outset, Goodheart again DH's.


  Catcher Opitz "one of the best catchers I've ever had, and I've had some good ones," Van Horn said, returning moved left to center field Christian Franklin and of course junior shortstop Casey Martin of Lonoke and junior right fielder Heston Kjerstad are everyone's Preseason All-Americans.


  Does Van Horn feel concern about the preseason hype and pressure of knowing as juniors this is their ideal last pre-draft Arkansas distracting his two stars?


  "There is, but it's all self-inflicted," Van Horn said. "They've got to learn how to handle it. We've been talking to them about it. We talk to them about it all the time as a team. They hear it when their freshmen about the stress of the junior year. It's just human nature to be a little uptight."


  What does Van Horn suggest?


  "Really what I tell them is you just treat this semester of your junior year like any other year," Van Horn said. "Get up and go to class. Just stay on routine and it'll all work out. If you start stressing out it just snowballs on you. Just stick with routine, do what you've been doing and it'll all work out."


  No. 1 2019 Arkansas pitcher Isaiah Campbell has taken his 12-1 record and 2.13 ERA to the pros. So last year's No. 2 and No. 3 starters as freshmen, Connor Noland of Greenwood and lefty Patrick Wicklander, each move up a notch as sophomores starting with the first games of the Feb. 14-16 season- opening 3-game series at Baum Walker against Eastern Illinois.


  "I would say probably Noland would throw Game 1 right now and Wicklander Game 2," Van Horn said. "They've both looked really good so far and done really well."


  The Sunday start of the traditionally Friday through Sunday baseball weekends and customary Tuesday starting role are up for grabs with lots of candidates.


  So is the closer, vacated by turned pro 3-year fireman from the bullpen rescuer Matt Cronin.


  "We have got to figure out how to handle that bullpen and how we want to finish games," Van Horn said. "Because you know a lot of games are won in the eighth and ninth and we don't want to let them slip away."

  In 2010, Arkansas ranked 38th in Census participation. This means we left billions of dollars on the table that could have been used for critical projects like highway construction, rural broadband and water systems.

Sabato sera ore 23:30, zona Monte Sacro, periferia di Roma, un 45enne albanese viene freddato con quattro colpi di pistola. Uno al torace, uno alla testa fatale. La vittima, che era sottoposta a regime di semilibertà, era in permesso premio. Era andato a trovare la moglie in via Gabrio Casati. Ha salutato la famiglia, stava uscendo di casa per tornare in carcere a Rebibbia. A pochi passi dal portone, gli spari. La dinamica non lascia spazio ai dubbi. È stata un'esecuzione. Un omicidio a sangue freddo, premeditato. Il 118 arrivato poco dopo ha cercato inutilmente di rianimare l'uomo. Il corpo era a terra, accanto a un'auto parcheggiata. La vittima aveva precedenti penali, stava scontando una pena definitiva. Aveva scontato molti anni di carcere. La squadra mobile che sta indagando, sta cercando di capire perché è stato ucciso. Siamo al confine con il Tufello, una delle tante piazze di spaccio della Capitale in mano alla criminalità organizzata. Si cerca una banda di più persone che sarebbe fuggita immediatamente.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the country's new 20-year security will extend the average maturity on the government's debt while adding that ultra-long bonds aren't coming any time soon. The Treasury yield curve flattened further following his comments.


  Issuing ultra-long bonds, those due in more than 30 years, is "no longer on the near term -- our focus for the moment is issuing the 20-year," Mnuchin said in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, where he's attending the World Economic Forum.


  The Treasury Department last week announced it will start issuing 20-year bonds in the first half of 2020, expanding its roster of securities as the government seeks ways to fund a budget deficit that's set to reach $1 trillion this year.


  "If you look at the number of 20-year bonds that we'll raise, this will slightly extend" the average maturity, he said, declining to predict by how much. "This isn't going to be a massive extension."


  Lengthening average maturity allows the government to spread risk over a longer period and lock in borrowing costs at the current low level. The average maturity of Treasury debt outstanding is hovering just under 70 months, compared with the average since 1980 of about 60 months. It peaked at 70.7 months in mid-2017.


  Mnuchin's comments underscore a shift in a policy in place since 2017, when the Treasury Department decided to stop attempting to lengthen the maturity of the government's debt. In announcing the 2017 change in its borrowing strategy, Treasury officials also appeared to de-emphasize the concept of weighted average maturity as a basis for debt policy, making clear that the focus instead was on getting the best deal for the taxpayer in the long run.


  The idea of 50-year or 100-year bonds is on ice for now, but it is something that the Treasury will continue to review and consider, Mnuchin said. Many on Wall Street have lobbied against such tenors.


  Ultra-long debt could help limit the cost to taxpayers of plugging the budget shortfall. "The main purpose is to fund the government at the best risk- adjusted rate," Mnuchin said.


  Treasuries pared their declines following Mnuchin's comments and the 5-year to 30-year yield curve flattened slightly as longer-dated debt outperformed.


  With a 20-year bond on the horizon, the Treasury Department is also weighing whether it should increase its daily cash balance for "risk-management purposes," Mnuchin said.


  "If we do that it'll be done in a way that it doesn't impact the markets and the Fed can manage it along with everything."


  Glitches in the market for repurchase agreements in recent months have drawn attention to swings in the amount of cash reserves that the Treasury holds at the Federal Reserve.


  The Federal Reserve has so far succeeded in thwarting a repeat of the upheaval seen in mid-September -- when overnight repo rates surged to 10% from around 2%. It has done so through a combination of repo-market liquidity injections and a program to purchase Treasury bills that's aimed at ensuring an ample supply of reserves.


  Mnuchin has said he believes the Fed has resolved the technical issues that caused the glitch and he doesn't expect them to happen again, adding that any issues with regulations are separate.

Battery life that can keep up with screen time
 Along with the screen and camera quality, battery life is consistently one of the top three features that phone buyers care about most. An expensive foldable phone that can't last a full day, or that loses significant capacity over the course of a year or two, won't win long-term fans. Phone-makers that can give their devices comparable battery life will have an advantage.
 Large-screen phones have become good at extracting all-day life from extra- large batteries, but foldable phones are a different story. Most of the designs we've seen use two smaller batteries that combine to get enough capacity to power it for a whole workday.
 Separate batteries may be a solution for now, but they're less efficient. Instead, one large battery will get you the most mileage per charge. Foldable phones will need to find a way to make these phones more efficient, or risk angering customers who paid top dollar for less battery life than they expect.

Imagine that you are in a cubicle located in the middle of the office floor plate. Your office has a glazed front, but you are looking into another open office. You have no real window or view to the outside, so you can't tell if it's raining outside or sunny. If you are lucky, and you do have a window, it's fixed, and you are looking into an office in the neighbouring building that is five metres away.


  The fluorescent lighting that you sit under for eight hours has thrown out your body's natural circadian rhythm. The ventilation is alright, but you start to feel droopy at around 3pm because the carbon dioxide levels in your shoebox have risen. It might even feel a bit stuffy, regardless of the door being open or closed. As you don't have an operable window, you have been breathing in recycled air all day. When you get outside and take a breath, you will instantly notice that the air outside is fresh.


  Now multiply that by five days a week, 48 weeks a year. Maybe you will get a pot plant in a few weeks.


  ## The Biophilia Hypothesis


  Exposure to the natural world is essential for human wellbeing because humans have an innate connection with the natural world (Gills).


  It sounds obvious, doesn't it? But how often do we rely on the natural world to recharge and reconnect? We live in a world full of distractions and in a culture that prioritises efficiency, quick change and instant gratification. Is it any wonder that the rates of anxiety and depression are increasing, and our knowledge and awareness of mental health issues and mindfulness are growing to combat this?


  We need the natural environment now more than ever. To look beyond the concrete jungle that has become our normal life, and find moments to breathe, destress and recover. Nature has been there all along, patiently waiting for us to stop, take a breath and recharge.


  What does this have to do with design and architecture, you might ask?

The state has 416 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. While the final count of ballots, including late ballots counted up to a month later, determine the exact number of delegates, Mitchell said the early vote plays a big part of calling the projected winner on Super Tuesday.
 "The Wednesday morning number is a combination of poll voters and early voters," he said. "The early stuff is going to impact what people really think of as the benefits of winning California on Super Tuesday. The mold is going to be set from the results of those earlier voters."
 ## Impact of early voting
 Mitchell said while people can "easily read too much into" the early vote, it's still a good way to take "the temperature of the electorate as it develops."
 In California's 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders by about 8 percentage points. According to Mitchell's voter data, Clinton had a 7 percentage-point advantage over Sanders when it came to the early vote ballots.
 Simon said the ebb and flow of the Democratic field is an interesting factor for early voters, since candidates could drop out before Super Tuesday.
 "There may be someone who is on fire to vote for a candidate that they really, really support. But who knows if their candidate will even be in the race by March 3? So, my sense is people are hedging their bets and waiting a little bit," said Simon.
 Everyone in Senseman's group, except for Senseman's son, voted for Elizabeth Warren. To Senseman, the benefit of getting votes in early is the time it saves.

How did volleyball become the No. 1 girls sport in America?


  Well, before you burn your lips on a hot bowl of cream of wheat, girls basketball was declared the No. 1 high school girls sport between 2009-10 and 2018-19.


  But volleyball's not far behind. According to Statista, there were 16,572 high school volleyball programs, a jump of nearly 1,200 new teams over that period.


  For the time being, according to Statista, volleyball is the third most popular girls sport in the nation, just behind basketball and track.


  One of them, the Hackett Hornets, won the 2A state championship last year with a roster of girls who got their start with the Fort Smith Juniors.


  It's not about winning national championships at 12 years old; it's more about cultivating.


  Hackett became the sixth high school in the River Valley to win a state championship this century, following Southside, Mansfield, Paris, Greenwood and Lavaca.


  Don't count out Van Buren, Northside, Charleston, Alma or Booneville with making future title runs, either.


  Southside coach Natalie Throneberry played on two of the school's state titles in 2003-04. Before 1999, however, she wanted nothing to do with the sport.


  Volleyball in the Fort Smith region is clearly the No. 1 sport.


  "I started playing volleyball in the seventh grade," remembers Throneberry, a fierce hitter for coach Steve Haaser's squad.


  "I was coming from private school (ICC) to public school, and my sister (Amber) told me I wouldn't have any friends if I didn't play," Throneberry said. "I played volleyball and I helped my sister. My job was to throw it in the air and she would hit it, and I thought this is the dumbest sport ever.


  "Then I went to a camp and I was hooked forever."


  By today's standards, Throneberry was a late starter. The seed is planted much earlier in today's travel-ball happy world.


  "We lowered the nets to the ground during our camp for kindergarten girls," Throneberry said. "We use beach balls to help them. We're just trying to get them to have some fun."


  This weekend, teams from Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee and Arkansas converged on Fort Smith for the Battle at the Fort.


  Twenty years after signing on to play volleyball with Fort Smith Juniors, Throneberry will reap the benefits of the Battle at the Fort.


  The same holds true for Greenwood volleyball coach Jennifer Golden, who has built a monster program, and many others -- Northside's Matt Waack, Lavaca's Shannon Todaro, Hackett's Bridget Freeman, Mansfield's Kaylie Pyles, Alma's Kim Weaver and Van Buren's Brent Reeves, among others, are also benefactors of the FSJ program.


  "It's an amazing atmosphere over there," Throneberry said. "You cannot believe the impact club volleyball has on our program. I've always seen what it could do. But getting involved in the club, to see how much training goes in and how parents spend nights and weekends, in addition to their jobs, is why what they've done with FSJ, compared to the '99 year, to see what it's become.      "A lot of blood sweat and tears -- it's become a premier tournament in our area."


  Volleyball isn't just something to pass the time during first few months of the school year, it's become this larger-than-life machine that, for two weekends in the winter, pumps life into the Fort Smith economy.      Everybody wins.

 Raised in Germany, residents put their slippers on to fetch the paper in the morning and brought their recyclables out to the curb as well, he said.
 Noll said recycling is just second nature to people from his native land. German children learn from an early age about the importance of recycling and to not be wasteful.

Charging up at the Bellmead Walmart costs her roughly 21 cents per minute, costing her about an hour of her time and between $5 and $6 to charge her battery to 85%, and her local Nissan dealership offers free charging during business hours.
 “In 4 months, I’ve spent less to charge than I would have spent on two weeks of gas in one of my other cars,” Porter said.
 Electric vehicles have dropped in price, improved in battery performance and gained market share over the last decade, increasingly making economic as well as environmental sense to early adopters such as Porter. Major car companies are pouring billions of dollars into electric cars, which now account for about 1.8 percent of sales.
 In Waco, city officials are considering adding electric vehicles to their fleet. But road bumps remain on the road to wider adoption, especially in smaller markets such as Waco’s, where charging stations are few and far between.
 Randy Glass, a Douglass Nissan sales consultant, said the dealership sold two electric vehicles last year.
 “If they could get more charger stations, it would help eliminate the phobia people have with the distance,” Glass said. “If you’re coming from Austin to Dallas, you need to know exactly where these charging stations are.”
 Porter and Glass both said electric cars are great for local driving, but road trips require meticulous planning, and failing to account for the lack of charging stations between major cities could cut a trip short.
 Porter uses PlugShare, an app that helps drivers find chargers and plan routes ahead of time.
 Porter spent about $13,000 for her used Leaf with about 29,000 miles, and new models go for about $32,000, with some federal rebates available.
 Jay Miller, a Nissan shop foreman, owns a 2018 Leaf SV model.
 “The first weekend I had the car, I drove to Dallas,” Miller said. “If you’re going to do that, you need to plan ahead and find out where charging stations are.”
 Porter addressed the city’s Sustainable Resource Practices Advisory Board at its January meeting, explaining the predicament electric vehicle drivers face.
 Ashley Nystrom, an executive director for the city manager’s office, gave a presentation on a $12 million Texas Commission on Environmental Quality reimbursement grant that funds up to 50% of a project.
 A single entity can apply for multiple grants, so long as they aren’t all used for the same location. The deadline is March 18, 2020.
 “There’s a big variability when you look at the cost of buying and installing these stations that comes from a few different things,” Nystrom said. “That would be the type of charger you choose to install, the location you pick is a big one, and what kind of infrastructure is there to support it.”
 Level 1 chargers, which use a 120 volt plug, are typically at-home chargers and make up less than 5% of public charging stations. Level 2 chargers can charge a vehicle overnight and make up about 80% of public charging outlets. Level 3 chargers are rapid chargers that use a direct 280 volt current and are easily the most expensive of the three.
 “These are ideal for people driving long distances,” Nystrom said.

“The program is first-come, first-served and thus application should be immediate,” Northcutt said. “There are many city of Waco cars which absolutely can be replaced with electric vehicles. As a reminder, the city must replace gas fueled cars with EVs as soon as possible since the city must cut greenhouse gas emissions 45% in 11 years, according to the gold standard science from the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change].”
 Gabriel Collins, a fellow in energy & environmental regulatory affairs at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, said while electric engines are about four times as efficient as internal combustion engines, electric batteries are limited by their size. At the high end of the scale, Tesla batteries hold about 100 kilowatt hours.
 “Even with that efficiency handicap, you can still share so much more energy on board a car with a fuel tank,” Collins said. “This is a question of practical use.”
 He said while electric car sales have been increasing, they’re still a long way from selling at the same scale as traditional vehicles. He said while there’s many reasons, he’d chalk it up to a lack of awareness among consumers.
 “I think as [more] manufacturers make vehicles, it will start to change,” Collins said. “The question is, can we get a broader range of income levels excited about electric cars?”
 Earlier this year, Ford announced plans to release an electric F150 model truck, along with a video of the vehicle towing train cars. Collins said he sees the truck and the marketing surrounding it as a distinct departure from previous ads, which tend to focus on the environmental benefits of electric cars.
 “I think the reality is when we look at vehicle purchases, there’s practicality, but there’s also emotional factors,” Collins said. “This is so radically different from the electric vehicle commercials we see now.”
 He said that in the next five years, as technology advances and companies develop more efficient lithium batteries supporting larger vehicles, he expects more hybrid trucks and SUVs on the market.
 “If you get a truck like that, with 20 to 30 miles to the gallon on the highway, that would be revolutionary,” Collins said.
 He said when municipalities decide whether or not to install electric charging stations for public use, public opinion is the deciding factor. They must also grapple with a classic chicken-and-egg dilemma: Are electric cars just not popular, or does the lack of chargers actively discourage people from buying them?
 “There’s some fairly complicated policy and human behavior questions, and there’s also a question of fairness,” Collins said. “I think that’s far from resolved.”
 District 5 City Councilman Jim Holmes said he’s interested in the possibility of introducing more electric vehicles into city fleets, as the technology advances and becomes less expensive.
 “I’m not saying I want to go 100% like some people want to do, but I do think it makes sense to introduce it into the budget to see how viable they are,” Holmes said.
 “I feel responsible, as a citizen and as a council, to at least look at the information that’s there, instead of just dismissing it as space-age or futuristic,” Holmes said. “It’s real, and it’s something that’s becoming a bigger and bigger part of the economy.”

A few days after I got to Haifa, Israel, where I’m spending part of a sabbatical, I took a walk down to what’s known as the German Colony. In the center of the area, I saw a menorah for the celebration of Hanukkah. I also saw a Christmas tree, and the crescent that symbolizes Islam. It took me a few more days to learn that this display appears every December in honor of the Holiday of Holidays, a two-week celebration of three of the main faiths to which Haifa is home, where you can also find the global center of Baha’i and many Druze as well. This is Haifa. This is Israel at its best, not a place of perfect peace, but certainly a place of possibility.


  I’ve been spending some time volunteering at a senior center. I’ve heard conversations in Hebrew, Arabic and English. I’ve heard singing, and laughter that requires no language at all. I’ve discussed religion with Jews, Christians and Muslims. The center is run by a Jewish organization with a Christian Arab as its director. Just down the road from the center is a community garden. Individuals of all faiths have their own little plots to tend, but they often come together at the site to share the work and to share meals and friendship. From kindergarten on, in a school run by Judaism’s Reform movement, the student population, which is mostly Jewish, welcomes students of the other faiths as well. Every summer, they offer a joint Jewish/Arab summer camp. While the technical language for these efforts speaks about “shared society” and “coexistence,” at the Leo Baeck Educational Center some simply call this “existence.” This is what it means to be connected to Leo Baeck, but in many ways, this is what it means to live in Haifa.


  Life didn’t just unfold like this, and it wasn’t always easy. After violent conflict, many Arabs fled Haifa as Israel came into existence in 1948, and some were forced from their homes. Nevertheless, there was already a vision in place to bring people together here, and that is the sentiment that prevails today. It is important to note that the non-Jews living here are citizens of Israel. Israelis often refer to the Arab citizens as Israeli Arabs, while many refer to themselves as Palestinian Israelis. Even in the terminology, you can begin to see the challenge. We must consider another dimension, too. The Palestinians of the West Bank are, for the most part, not citizens. They largely do not factor into the equation in Haifa. The Leo Baeck community tries to address this issue as well. Just two weeks ago, the folks at Leo Baeck hosted a group from Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. This is part of an annual exchange that has been going on for five years, and also includes West Bank Palestinians. Looking at Israelis, Palestinians and Irish, we see a shared history of conflict and bitter divides. While friendships have developed among some of the individuals, it is a far cry from bringing peace. It is, however, an effort at peacemaking in places where people assume that peace is impossible.
