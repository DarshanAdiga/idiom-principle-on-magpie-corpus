"Out of the blue and Gorgie City Farm - it's an institution and the era but it's been an immense support for many, many families over the years. For local residents, it's a calm space, to go and visit the animals. See the pets. The experience of having that kind of quality urban area and the biodiversity it brings is something people really value in Gorgie, but it's a wider benefit to the community. So the absolute need is to get the council to pull people together and make sure that the land is protected, that it's saved, and that it is still used for that type of use. So a community facility, but also one that's very much about our local environment."

To explain leveraged buyouts in easier-to-understand terms, let’s say you buy a house. Under normal circumstances, if you can’t pay for the mortgage, you would be in trouble. But by the LBO rules, you’re only responsible for a portion. If you pay for 30 percent of the house, the other 70 percent of the asking price is debt placed on the house. The house owes that money to the bank or creditor who lent it, not you. Of course, a house can’t owe money. But under the private equity model, it does, and its assets — its factories, stores, equipment, etc. — are collateral.

What happened with Deadspin is emblematic of what is often a flaw in private equity, especially when it comes to big firms: They can get involved in businesses they’re not well-versed in. The Carlyle Group and other investors probably didn’t know what they were getting into when they helped producer Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings buy Taylor Swift’s catalog. A decade ago, private equity firm Terra Firma learned a hard lesson when it took over music group EMI, dropped a bunch of artists to try to save money, and saw that deal turn into a disaster.

Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar industry with small-time criminals, large organized crime syndicates, and terrorist organizations, robbing 25 million victims around the globe of their freedom. The U.S. is not immune, and in fact provides a large portion of the world’s demand for sex and labor slaves. U.S citizens and migrants in the U.S. on legal work visas are enslaved from all areas of the country. Human trafficking does not discriminate and takes victims from all socioeconomic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, including women and men, boys and girls. Revenue from this lucrative activity flows through our U.S. financial system, but financial institutions are in the unique position to identify, prevent, and disrupt human trafficking. Through continued awareness within your own community and your financial institution, you will make a difference in stopping this heinous crime, and one day hopefully end slavery once and for all.

Is private equity a giant money monster that eats up companies and spits them out as the husks of what they once were, prioritizing short-term gains over creating long-term value and doing a ton of damage to everyday Americans in the process? Or does it, as some in the industry would suggest, just have a PR problem? Their argument: Sure, sometimes things go wrong, but private equity wouldn’t be in business — and have the money invested it does — if it didn’t often succeed as well. Industry advocates argue they’re taking on risk a lot of other investors would eschew, and it’s only fair they be rewarded.

When Hollinger says “clean,” he means more than scrubbing behind the ears. He’s talking about the holistic impact that a product carries with it, from how it affects the body it’s absorbed into, to how the ingredients are harvested and processed, to what happens to the product once it disappears down the drain. “When we think about elevating bathing, we look at the food movement as an example. People today recognize that what they eat really makes a difference. In bathing products, that has been largely ignored.

The controversy surrounding private equity is that whatever happens to the company acquired, private equity makes money anyway. Firms generally have a 2-20 fee structure, which means they get a 2 percent management fee from their investors and then a 20 percent performance fee on the money they make from their deals. Basically, if an investment goes well, they get 20 percent of that. But regardless of what happens, they get 2 percent of the money they’re managing altogether, which is a lot. According to data from consultancy firm McKinsey, the global private equity industry’s asset value has grown to nearly $6 trillion.

Emily Mendell, managing director at the Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA), a trade association for private equity investors, told me that it’s happened often over the years that certain headline or political events — such as the Toys R Us bankruptcy or Warren’s plan — have shined a light on the industry that is “accentuated due to the news nature of that event.” And it’s not always easy to push back. “It’s hard to tell a positive story when the negative stories — the few negative stories — will get all the press,” she said. “Private equity can’t counter what Elizabeth Warren says on the back of a bumper sticker.”
