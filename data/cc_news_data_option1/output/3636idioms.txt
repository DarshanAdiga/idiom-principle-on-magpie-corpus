Malcom, 54, said he’s long considered a run for the county’s highest elected office but felt the time was finally right for him to make a move.
 “This is something I discussed, prayed about and consulted with others about the majority of my career,” said Malcom. “It was all about timing – when is the right time?
 “In the last three years, it’s been a topic of conversation with my family and friends and people within law enforcement and the courts. I’ve been getting advice and listening to people who were close to me. I felt like this is the time to put my name out there and put myself out there and ask the citizens of Newton County to consider me.”
 The Social Circle native, who began his law enforcement career at the age of 18 with the Walton County Sheriff’s Department, has covered a variety of responsibilities in his long career with the Covington Police Department, not the least of which was overseeing the department’s considerable budget.
 “I have managed a multi-million dollar law enforcement budget,” said Malcom, who announced his candidacy in January of 2019. “I managed our budget during the housing crash, when things got tight and difficult, so you had to make sure to do everything in your power to spend each penny wisely because of the limited resources you had.
 “I did that effectively and it gave me a new skill set, so that if I have the opportunity to manage a larger budget, I’ve got a great understanding of how to make that happen.”
 A longtime proponent of the community policing model, Malcom’s tentpole slogan for his campaign is “For a safer Newton County.” When asked how he planned to effect increased public safety if he’s elected, Malcom pointed to collaboration with other law enforcement agencies in the county, a reallocation of funding to get more deputies on the road and an aggressive recruiting program to increase staffing.

The mission ended early because of what appears to be a bit of unwanted back- and-forth wobbling in the rocket as it ascended, Astra said, which caused an engine shutdown by the vehicle's automated safety system. That's actually also good news, since it means the steps Astra has taken to ensure safe failures are also working as designed. You can see in the video above that the light of the rocket's engines simply go out during flight, and then some time later there's a fireball from its impact on the ground.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is preparing to outline Saturday the details of a program to boost Greece’s defense capabilities, amid heightened tensions with neighboring Turkey over rights to resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Mitsotakis was expected to lay out the plan, which involves military procurement, reinforcing military personnel and developing the country’s domestic defense industry, during a state of the economy address in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. Nominally NATO allies, Greece and Turkey have deployed naval and air force units to assert the countries' competing claims over energy rights in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkish survey vessels and drill ships continue to prospect for gas in waters where Greece and the European island nation of Cyprus claim exclusive economic rights. The increasing tension at sea has led to concerns the situation could spiral into armed conflict between the two NATO members. Turkey accuses Greece of trying to grab an unfair share of maritime resources and Cyprus of disregarding the rights of Turkish Cypriots on the ethnically divided island. Cyprus has been divided into a Greek-Cypriot south and a Turkish-occupied north since a 1974 invasion by Turkey in response to a coup seeking to unite the island with Greece. A breakaway state in the north is recognized only by Turkey. Greece and Turkey have conducted rival naval exercises amid their standoff. On Friday, Turkey issued a new Navtex, or international maritime safety message, for Sept. 12-Sept. 14 live-fire exercises between its southern coast and northern Cyprus. Athens has been pushing for the European Union to impose sanctions on Turkey unless Ankara withdraws its research vessel, the Oruc Reis, from the area of the...
