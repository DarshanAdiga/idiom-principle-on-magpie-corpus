BOONE — Watauga County has developed a plan with input from local leaders on a phased approach for the reopening of businesses and short-term rentals and easing of other restrictions that would follow similar guidelines from Gov. Roy Cooper.
 The governor’s executive orders allow for local government restrictions that go beyond the statewide mandates. Watauga County and the county’s four municipalities have amended their declarations of emergency to enact restrictions banning overnight lodging and short-term rentals, closing all public playgrounds, recreational courts and shelters and requiring 14-day quarantines for those arriving from an overnight stay outside of the county.
 County Manager Deron Geouque presented the Watauga County Board of Commissioners with three options for reopening plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic during the group’s May 5 virtual meeting. Geouque said plans were made in consultation with local municipal leaders, the Boone Area Chamber of Commerce and officials of surrounding counties.
 Option 1 — which the commissioners unanimously approved — will mirror the same timeframe that Cooper will implement. Cooper’s plan involves three phases, and the county plan will not lift local restrictions until phase 2. According to Geouque, Watauga officials will wait two weeks after the beginning of the state’s phase 2 to implement a partial lifting of some restrictions.
 Geouque said the decision was made to ease restrictions two weeks into phase 2 as restaurants and more businesses will be allowed to open during that phase. County officials would like to use the two-week span to monitor impacts.
 If metrics are met and local health officials deem it appropriate, then option 1 allows the county to authorize short-term rentals with a reduction in occupancy — facilities with more than a six-person occupancy shall be limited to 50 percent of occupancy capacity or 50 percent of available rental units — whichever is less — during the second week of phase 2. At the same time, the county would discontinue the 14-day self-quarantine restriction.
 AppHealthCare Health Director Jennifer Greene said that with more testing on the horizon and the easing of restrictions, Watauga will experience more COVID-19 cases. She said the county is hoping for more of a consistent “storm” rather than a “flash flood of cases.”
 In order to perform more testing, Greene said AppHealthCare must ensure in tandem that it has the capability of widespread contact tracing in place. The agency is trying to time its testing expansion in concert with gaining more help with contact tracing as officials “can’t do one without the other.”
 Greene has participated in a state team that’s working to expand contact tracing via the Carolina Contact Tracing Collaborative monitored by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. NCDHHS has selected a contractor — Community Care of NC — who will be hiring a workforce to deploy across the state, according to Greene.
 David Jackson, the president and CEO of the Boone Area Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber supports the two-week wait into phase 2 to allow businesses time to ramp back up. In order for the community to get back to a level that visitors can be welcomed, businesses need time, he said.
 “A bit of rationale behind the two weeks was to give our local infrastructure time to catch up to make sure that cleaning policies they may be implementing are indeed working and that they’re able to staff properly,” Jackson said. “So that they’re not forced into thinking they need to open at 100 percent when they might not financially be able to do so at this point in time.”
 The commissioners approved option 1 with an addition suggested by Watauga Tourism Development Authority Executive Director Wright Tilley. Tilley advised that the county include language about families being able to stay together in one rental unit. Tilley said the TDA had consistently heard from rental management companies throughout the county that it would be difficult to open without allowing a single family currently living together to occupy one dwelling.
 During phase 3 of the state plan, the county would have a total lifting of the occupancy reduction to allow establishments to operate at full capacity. Watauga will then follow the lead of the National Park Service on how it will open campgrounds — such as Price Park — to determine the approach to opening local campgrounds.
 The county’s option 2 would have removed all county restrictions with the implementation of Cooper’s phase I. Option 3 proposed to end all county restrictions with the implementation of the state’s phase 2.
 Boone Town Manager John Ward, Blowing Rock Town Manager Shane Fox and Seven Devils Town Manager Debbie Powers were all included in the May 5 call and each voiced their support for option 1.
 Geouque said he’d had conversations with officials in Alleghany, Ashe, Avery and Wilkes counties to see what other leaders may be implementing. He said that he believed that the Ashe County Board of Commissioners did not take action on the matter at its May 4 board meeting on Monday and planned to allow short-term rental restrictions to expire May 8 if Cooper’s phase 1 is implemented.
 According to Geouque, Avery County planned to lift the 14-day self quarantine in phase 1 while also using a 50 percent short-term rental occupancy restriction, similar to Watauga. He added that to his knowledge, Wilkes County was leaving decisions about short-term rentals up to its individual municipalities. Geouque said Watauga wanted to share a unified message about restrictions rather than municipalities offering different directives.
 The commissioners received seven letters for public comment — all gave remarks about restrictions and when they should be lifted. All but one called for the county to lift restrictions earlier; the one that agreed with option 1 to lift restrictions was Blowing Rock Town Council Member David Harwood.
 A letter from Blowing Rock Civic Association President Tim Gupton said the association encouraged the commissioners to lift the quarantine order at the beginning of Phase 1 as outlined in Cooper’s plan. He said the group also believed that returning homeowners were a lower risk to the community than tourists.
 “Returning homeowners are traveling from one stay-at-home community to another and those restrictions are adequate to allow for an orderly return to Blowing Rock,” said Gupton in his letter. “If homeowners wait until the county lifts the quarantine order at the same time as they lift the rental restriction order then both homeowners and tourists could descend on our town at once. So, we believe a phased approach makes more sense.”
 A joint statement was sent from Hound Ears Club President Ann Lovern and COO/General Manager Russ Curtis. The officials listed changes to the club’s operations it had made so far and other precautions taken to keep club members safe. Lovern and Curtis stated that while Hound Ears strives for a safe environment, the club also needs to provide part-time residents, members and seasonal renters the “opportunity to safely enjoy the High Country.” The two urged the county to support option 2.
 Debbie Miller and Richard Miller are both part-time residents in Beech Mountain and wrote separate statements. Debbie Miller said she has owned a home in Beech Mountain for 20 years, and also resides in Florida.
 “I am very concerned for our country if states don’t begin to open up immediately,” said Debbie Miller in her comments. “Please do not delay and consider the permanent, extensive, economical damage that could occur.”

"articleBody": "
 Things are always clear to the armchair quarterbacks who sit on the sidelines and, with the benefit of hindsight, judge the plays made in real time.
 While there's an element of this unfairness in some of the critiques of how governments have responded to the pandemic, that's not the case when it comes to the massive failure to protect long-term-care homes.
 Provincial governments -- particularly Ontario, which lived through the SARS outbreak in 2003 -- had all the knowledge and opportunity needed to make better and faster decisions that would have saved lives.
 Ontario had plenty of warning about the risky conditions in long-term-care homes, but it didn't act. Expert reports, seemingly, were not read. Pandemic plans were not followed. There were early lessons from the outbreak in a care home in Kirkland, Wash., followed by another in North Vancouver, that went unheeded.
 As Jesse McLean and Alyshah Hasham detailed in The Star on Tuesday, at every turn the Ford government could have -- and should have -- done more to prevent the catastrophe of infections and deaths in long-term-care homes.
 It is not the case, as the government has tried to claim, that it didn't have a "playbook" to handle COVID-19 in these homes.
 "We knew what was needed," Laura Tamblyn Watts, CEO of CanAge, a national seniors advocacy organization, told the Star. "The problem was the Ontario government didn't do it."
 When it came to preparing hospitals and expanding intensive care units for the potential onslaught of COVID-19 cases, the government acted swiftly. But when it came to protecting the most vulnerable seniors in care facilities, the government started behind the curve and remains there still.
 Instead of using all the available expert advice, reports and plans to get ahead of potential problems, the government waited until the problems were too big and too public to ignore, and only then took action.
 There's a heavy price to pay for delay in a pandemic. As we know, the cases we see today are a consequence of the decisions made -- or not made -- weeks ago.
 The government didn't move to restrict visitors from long-term-care homes until the middle of March, well after others called for this protective measure.
 It didn't restrict staff from working in multiple homes until the middle of April -- and even then the ban didn't come into effect for another week and it didn't apply to all workers.
 The province was slow on its guidance for the use of personal protective equipment and ensuring that homes had sufficient supply.
 Ontario didn't start mass testing in long-term-care homes until late April (weeks after experts called for it and the premier promised it), and it's still not complete.
 Each critical step came later than it should have. Because of that, the virus was able to take hold and spread in far too many care homes.
 It's the equivalent of not sounding the alarm while the invaders are racing over the hill toward the castle, but waiting until they've broken through the outer and inner defences.
 COVID-19 has now killed more than 1,360 people in Ontario -- and three- quarters of them were residents of nursing homes. Other provinces have seen a comparable toll on people in long-term care, and for very similar reasons.
 It didn't have to be this way. There were many unknowns about the coronavirus, but one thing that was easily foreseeable was the devastating effect it would have in long-term-care homes, packed with elderly, infirm people living in close quarters.
 So, armed as it was with many playbooks -- from expert reports to pandemic plans -- Ontario should have jumped into action to prepare long-term-care homes just as it did for hospitals.
 Tragically it didn't and vulnerable seniors have paid, and continue to pay, a heavy price for that.

So you can expect material costs, by and large, to flex according to usage. And then we go through, as I said, the more extreme would be some of the staff costs, particularly in Europe, where any adjustments would need to be made after consultation with the European Works Councils and those sort of things. And so when we think about that, that it takes a longer time to flex it in accordance with the future demand outlook that we believe we’ll see. And so that’s what we’re trying to do. So there’s a guide in terms of what’s truly fixed versus variable, and the variables is in accordance with time, because the basic philosophy being there’s very little that should be considered to be permanent or fixed. It’s all to do with the passage of time.

Back then, we were cash flow positive when the capital is coming in and cash flow positive when capital is going out. And so that’s where I start, because I think that’s really important. And my expectation at this point, bear in mind, I’d say, we haven’t given guidance, so there haven’t been a newer number. But we expect to be cash flow positive in 2020 when we’ll see an inflow, and we’ll be cash positive in 2020 when we’ll see an outflow. So at this point in time, that’s what I believe to be the case.

MATHEWS -- Central Lafourche senior athlete Sarah Hodson has been busy as a bee during her four years of high school.
   
 She has excelled in four sports -- soccer, swimming, golf and cross country.
   
 Here is a few of her accomplishments at Central Lafourche:
   
 -- She played in the Division II soccer state championship as a sophomore and helped the Lady Trojans finish as state runner-up.
   
 -- She qualified for the state swimming championship meet all four years.
   
 -- She scored the low round at the state golf championship meet as a junior.
   
 -- She was named District MVP in swimming as a senior.
   
 -- She was a district champion in cross country for last three years.
   
 While standing out in athletics, Hodson has experienced success in academics as well. She will graduate as one of Central Lafourche's valedictorians with a 4.27 GPA (she scored 30 on ACT) this year and she was a senior class officer, National Honor Society president, Student Council member and Beta Club member.
   
 Hodson said balancing a busy athletic schedule and academic slate was tough but she got through it.
   
 "Being involved in four sports for three years and three sports my senior year definitely had its challenges, but I wouldn't trade the memories I've made for the world," Hodson said. "I have met so many people, built so many strong bonds with teammates and coaches and made the best memories throughout high school by playing sports."
   
 Before the coronavirus canceled spring sports seasons this year, Hodson was busy competing in golf for Central Lafourche.
   
 She was one of the area's top golfers. At the Division I girls state golf meet last year, she finished seventh in the individual standings. Hodson led after the first day with a score of 77 but had an 86 on the second day to finish at 163.
   
 Hodson said the Lady Trojans were hoping to compete for a team championship this year. They finished seventh in Division I team standings at state last year.
   
 "Since the end of the golf season last year, I worked day in and day out to be the best golfer I could be," Hodson said. "My teammates and I set a goal that we could be state champions at the end of this season and we worked really hard to hopefully be able to reach that goal. I definitely felt that my teammates and I had a really good chance at taking home a state title."
   
 Hodson said she also wanted to close out her high school career with an individual state title in girls' golf this year, but the coronavirus ended those plans.
   
 "When school was first canceled, my only hope left was the golf state championship," Hodson said. "When that was later canceled as well, there was nothing left of my senior year and it was really tough to feel like all that me and my teammates worked for was stripped away from us. I think it had such an impact on me because this was my last chance of being a state champion, and I never got the chance to compete for that title."
   
 Although the virus ruined her opportunity to win a state title, Hodson said she has plenty of great memories to last a lifetime.
   
 "My favorite memory overall would have to be all the friendships I made though, even from other schools," Hodson said. "I've played on the same team and competed against some of the best athletes in the state, and those people became my best friends."
   
 Hodson said her college decision is still up in the air at this moment. She had a few college visits scheduled but it was postponed due to the virus.
   
 Hodson, who plans to major in biology and pre-dentistry in college, said she has an offer to play golf at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, but she hasn't made any final decisions.
   
 Hodson took time to thank many of her coaches at Central Lafourche for her success.
   
 "(Central Lafourche golf coach) Bryan Myers has had a huge impact on my athletic career. Coach Myers has always believed in me and gave me confidence," Hodson said. "He always looked out for me with his best interest. Also Coach Jude Blanchard (girls' soccer), Mrs. Gaynell (swimming), Coach Traci Constant (cross country) and Coach Shelly Vedros (athletic director). All of these coaches have had an impact on me not only as an athlete but as a young adult as well."
   
 Hodson also credited her teammates in all sports for motivating her.
   
 "I'd like to thank all of the teammates I've had over the years," Hodson said. "I've played with my sister (Gabrielle Hodson), my cousins, and my best friends and they are the reason I've enjoyed high school sports as much as I did."
   
 Hodson also recognized her parents, David and Deanna Hodson, and two sisters, Gabrielle and Sophia Hodson, for their support.
   
 "They have been the biggest supporters through all four years," Sarah Hodson said. "There wasn't a meet, match, or game that one of them wasn't there."
   
 And Sarah Hodson's parents said they are proud of everything she has accomplished.
   
 "Sarah is truly the definition of what a student athlete should be," David Hodson said. "Although I am extremely proud of her hard work and success on the field, in the pool and on the golf course, her ability to balance athletics and high academic achievement is what makes me the proudest."
   
 "My job as a parent has been pretty easy due to Sarah's work ethic and passion," Deanna Hodson said. "In both academics and athletics, she strives every day to be better than she was the day before. Her compassion, dedication, and drive are just a few traits that have guided her to success thus far, but it is her humility and contagious smile that will lead her to success in the future."

 Some wineries are adept at making wines that truly do enhance the overall wine drinking experience. Such is the case with Delille Cellars. Since it's founding in 1992 this boutique artisan winery in Woodinville, Washington, has established itself on a few basic principles. First, always strive to craft the best wines possible, and second, never rest on your laurels.
 That sounds simple enough, right? The secret, however, is a willingness to always work harder than the competition and never accept the status quo. For years now these award-winning wines have garnered high praise from both critics and the public at large. As Chris Upchurch, one of the founder, likes to say, \"to make great wine, you must know great wine.\"
 I first stumbled upon Delille back in 1998. As is often the case, I was browsing a local wine store and found a section dedicated to the wines of Washington State. Having never tasted the wines of Delille, I decided this would be the moment of truth and purchased a bottle of their signature Syrah. Well here it is some 20 years later and I am still a big fan.
 Focusing primarily on French Bordeaux and Rhone-style varietals has become the winery's hallmark. That along with the perfect combination of climate, soil composition and winemaking skill are the underlying reasons for its enduring success. If you don't believe me then try some of these wines for yourself. In fact, here are three Delille wines that I highly recommend.
 The 2016, D2 Estate Red, a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, is bursting with personality. From the moment you uncork the bottle, aromas of blueberry, blackberry and currants are unleashed. The ripe, lush dark fruit flavors and oak influence combine to add depth and complexity. This bold and yet well-balanced wine finishes with a long, smooth finish. For a truly decadent treat, pair a glass with a slice of dark chocolate. SRP $38
 Perhaps no where else in America can you find better Syrah then in Washington state, and the Delille 2017 Signature Syrah is no exception. This amazing wine has a deep purple color that is enhanced by dark fruit aromas that jump from the glass. Full bodied and yet so refined with plum, licorice and tobacco flavors that are expertly interwoven with sharp acidity and long, luscious aftertaste. Wonderful with with baked stuffed chicken and French green beans. SRP $45
 For a white, the delightful 2018 Chaleur Estate Blanc is amazing. Made from Sauvignon Blanc and small amount of Semillon, this wine is bursting with aromas of gooseberry, herb and hints of pineapple. On the palate, full-bodied and quite flavorful with an abundance of kiwi fruit that only adds to this wine's depth and complexity. A clean, sharp finish leaves you yearning for more. I often chill a bottle then pair it with baked haddock and jasmine rice. SRP $35
 The recent promotions of Nick Bernstein to head winemaker and Mari Rossi as assistant winemaker are just another sign that Delille is committed to ensuring that top-notch winemaking talent remains in place. These two young people have a promising future in the wine industry and are excited to be part of the team.
 Delille wines are available locally and represent a unique wine drinking experience, one that I'm sure you'll find simply delightful. Cheers.
 Wine of the week: Torresella NV Prosecco, Italy. Light gold in color with green apple aromas made in a dry style. Soft, with a creamy fruitiness along with hints of almond on the palate. This wine is great as an aperitif or with sweets and soft cheeses. Make sure to serve well chilled. $17

Algeria international Farid El Melali will be tried for indecent exposure after allegedly masturbating in public, AFP learned on Tuesday on the Angers winger's 23rd birthday.
 El Melali was questioned by police in Angers late on Monday after his neighbours claimed they caught him exposing himself in front of a building where a woman was staying.
 The forward admitted to police to having an "inappropriate attitude", according to his lawyer Sandra Chirac-Kollarik, and thought he was alone in the courtyard of the building.
 "He wasn't targeting anyone, and wasn't aggressive towards anyone," Chirac- Kollarik said.
 The public prosecutor's department said El Melali had committed a similar act in April but the same victim was unable to identify the individual.
 El Melali, who signed a new contract with the Ligue 1 club on Monday, was released but will face trial in terms of an appearance prior to an admission of guilt.
 His side, who he joined in August 2018, said they had taken note of his situation and added they "would wait for the decision."
 In February, the outfit from western France's president Said Chabane had been questioned for "aggravated sexual aggression" following accusations from within the club.

Whether it’s going to continue to be terrific near term, time will tell. But our plan is, over the next five years, our current thinking is we will close more stores than we will open. We’ll open where the best real estate is available. Again, one of the silver linings, and I think there will be many based on what we’ve experienced in over the past couple of months is that the real estate market is going to be much more favorable.

One of the riskiest ICU procedures is inserting a breathing tube in a COVID-19 patient's airway, which creates a direct path for virus to escape from a patient's lungs. "If you're intubating a patient, that's a much higher risk than, say, going in and doing routine patient care," Hewlett says.
 So ICU teams are being advised to add several layers of protection beyond a surgical mask.
 Extra personal protective equipment may include an N95 respirator, goggles, a full face shield, a head hood, an impermeable isolation gown and double gloves.
 In many ICUs, teams are also placing a clear plastic box or sheet over the patient's head and upper body before inserting the tube. And as a final safety measure, the doctor may guide the tube using a video camera rather than looking directly down a patient's airway.
 "It usually takes 30 minutes or so in order to get all of that equipment together, to get all of the right people there," says Dr. Kira Newman, a senior resident physician at UW Medical Center in Seattle. "and that would be a particularly fast intubation."
 But most changes in the ICU are in response to an ongoing flood of new information about how COVID-19 affects the body.
 There's a growing understanding, for example, that the infection can cause dangerous blood clots to form in many severely ill patients. These clots can kill if they block arteries supplying the lungs or brain. But they also can prevent blood from reaching the kidneys or even a patient's arms and legs.
 Clots are a known risk for all ICU patients, Cooperman says, but the frequency and severity appears much greater with COVID-19. "So we're starting them on a higher level of medicine to prevent blood clots and if somebody actually develops blood clots, we have a plan B and a plan C and a plan D," he says.
 ICU teams are also recalibrating their approach to ensuring that patients are getting enough oxygen. Early in the pandemic, the idea was to put patients on mechanical ventilator quickly to make sure their oxygen levels didn't fall too far.
 But with experience, doctors have found that mechanical ventilators don't seem to work as well for COVID patients as they do for patients with other lung problems. They've also learned that that many COVID-19 patients remain lucid and relatively comfortable even when the oxygen levels in their blood are extremely low.
 So many specialists are now recommending alternatives to mechanical ventilation, even for some of the sickest patients. "We're really trying now to not intubate," Osborn says.
 Instead, ICU teams are relying on devices that deliver oxygen through the nasal passages, or through a mask that fits tightly over the face. And there's renewed interest in an old technique to help patients breathe. It's called proning.
 "Instead of them being on their back, we're turning them on their front," Osborn says. The reason, she says is to open up a part of the lung that is collapsed when a patient is on their back.

The retailer's parent company, L Brands Inc., saw its stock fall more than 15 percent in post-market trading on Monday after it walked away from the $525 million deal to sell a majority of the lingerie business to private equity firm Sycamore Partners, which got cold feet amid the coronavirus shutdown. L Brands' shares teetered back-and-forth between positive and negative during most of Tuesday’s session — closing down 3.49 percent to $11.62 apiece — as analysts looked to the future, when the company still plans to separate Victoria's Secret from the successful Bath & Body Works brand.

Cruz, 67, was charged the next day with malicious wounding and using a firearm to commit a felony.
 A magistrate judge on Saturday ordered Cruz held without bond, but it was unclear Tuesday where he was being held. A bail determination checklist showed he was still hospitalized.
 A sheriff’s department spokeswoman declined to say whether Cruz was in the hospital or jail, citing safety and security reasons. A spokesman for Sentara Healthcare also declined to disclose whether he or the other person were still hospitalized because it was a criminal matter.
 Although physicians specializing in ICU and respiratory care have been in high demand during the coronavirus crisis, it’s not known if Cruz was still practicing in those areas.
 He’s been working in addiction medicine with Rite Path Treatment Centers since 2015, according to the company’s website, which notes he also has a law degree and a master’s degree in business administration.
 The bail checklist in Cruz’s court file said he was “on meds and believes them to be a factor” in the incident. The document also noted he has no prior criminal history.
 Police were called at about 7:20 a.m. Friday to the Cruz home on Stone Church Mews for a reported shooting. The 3,200 square foot, red-brick house is located in the Church Point area, near Bayville Golf Club.
 Arriving officers found a man and a woman suffering from gunshot wounds that appeared life-threatening, police said. Both were transported to an area hospital for treatment.

As the pandemic persists in keeping families indoors or a safe social distance apart, online searches have increased for creative ways to still make moms feel special.
 Absent help from schools and babysitters, uninitiated dads are on homemade craft duty with the kids. Other loved ones are navigating around no-visitor rules at hospitals and senior-living facilities.
 Some medical facilities are pitching in by collecting voice and video recordings from locked-out relatives when patients are unable to manage the technology on their own.
 In suburban St. Louis, Steve Turner and his family hope to FaceTime with his 96-year-old mother, Beverly, but they plan something more, too. Her birthday coincides with Mother's Day this year.
 “We're going to create a big Mother's Day-birthday banner signed by the kids and grandkids who live here,” Turner said. “She loves butterflies and we'll draw some on. We're working with the home to find a place where we can stand outside a window so she can see us.”
 Anna Francese Gass in New Canaan, Connecticut, is hunkered down with her husband and three children and will enjoy her usual Mother's Day breakfast in bed of rubbery eggs, slightly burnt toast and VERY milky coffee. But the day won't include her own mom, who lives nearby.
 “I ordered a bunch of daffodil and tulip bulbs online, and me and the kids are planning to plant them in her flowerbed. She can supervise from the window. I just know it will put a huge smile on her face,” Francese Gass said.
 In Alameda, California, 23-year-old Zaria Zinn is sheltering at home with her parents and younger sister. Knowing how much their mother loves and misses traveling, they're turning their house and neighborhood into a trip around the world with help from decorations and virtual tours online.

Dear Dave,   Should my wife and I tithe on our stimulus checks? She thinks we should, but I'm not sure. In my mind, we already gave our money to Caesar - so to speak - and now he's just giving it back. What do you think?   Luke
 Dear Luke,   Well, it's your money you're getting back. The government doesn't really create anything, it only takes money from us. And in this case, it gave you back some of what it took. I don't really see that as a tithing circumstance.
 The other side of the coin is that you really can't go wrong being generous. The tithe is your baseline for generosity. You shouldn't tithe or not tithe because of a set of rules, but if you're having a theological or philosophical discussion about the tithe and how it works, I think your reasoning is sound.
 It's certainly not a salvation issue, but generosity is a good rhythm to have in your life. And honestly, these stimulus checks are kind of like tax refunds. You gave it to the government, and now they're giving it back.
 So, in my mind, it's okay either way. I've just always had an attitude of when in doubt, it's better to give.   Dave
 Go ahead, knock it out
 Dear Dave,   We make about $70,000 a year, and we're debt-free except for our house. We're following your plan, and just started saving for retirement, but we only have $15,000 left on our mortgage. We can have that paid off in six or seven months, so would it be okay to go ahead and pay off our home as soon as possible before continuing to save for retirement?   Nate
 Dear Nate,   I'm generally pretty hardcore about sticking with the proper order while doing the Baby Steps. But in your case, with such a small amount left to pay on your home, I think I'd go ahead and knock that out.
 Most of the people I talk to still have six figures left on their mortgages. There's a big difference between that and the situation you two are in right now. Think about it, you guys could be completely debt-free by Christmas, and you've already started to make a move on retirement planning. I say go for it!   Dave

Work on converting West Main Street from a one-way street to a two-way street is underway.
 Frankfort City Manager Keith Parker told The State Journal on Tuesday that the project has a completion date of July 9, but the city expects it to be finished by then.
 The Frankfort City Commission voted 4-1 in February to approve a contract with Arrow Electric Co. Inc. for $65,185 to replace signage, revise striping and place a new traffic signal at the Ann Street intersection. Commissioner Scott Tippett was the lone dissenter.
 As of Tuesday, there were no lane closures on West Main Street, but work has started at the Ann Street intersection.
 The city’s Public Works Department originally bid out the project in 2017. Then, the bid included curb and storm sewer modifications, but the cost was deemed by the city commission at the time to be too high.
 After putting the project on hold, Public Works bid out the project again in 2019 with the curb and sewer modifications removed, but received no bids.
 On Feb. 19, Public Works tried again and received two bids.
 Arrow Electric Co. Inc. bid $65,185 on the project and Signal Power and Light Inc. bid $77,700.

Some wineries are adept at making wines that truly do enhance the overall wine drinking experience. Such is the case with Delille Cellars. Since it's founding in 1992 this boutique artisan winery in Woodinville, Washington, has established itself on a few basic principles. First, always strive to craft the best wines possible, and second, never rest on your laurels.
 That sounds simple enough, right? The secret, however, is a willingness to always work harder than the competition and never accept the status quo. For years now these award-winning wines have garnered high praise from both critics and the public at large. As Chris Upchurch, one of the founder, likes to say, "to make great wine, you must know great wine."
 I first stumbled upon Delille back in 1998. As is often the case, I was browsing a local wine store and found a section dedicated to the wines of Washington State. Having never tasted the wines of Delille, I decided this would be the moment of truth and purchased a bottle of their signature Syrah. Well here it is some 20 years later and I am still a big fan.
 Focusing primarily on French Bordeaux and Rhone-style varietals has become the winery's hallmark. That along with the perfect combination of climate, soil composition and winemaking skill are the underlying reasons for its enduring success. If you don't believe me then try some of these wines for yourself. In fact, here are three Delille wines that I highly recommend.
 The 2016, D2 Estate Red, a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, is bursting with personality. From the moment you uncork the bottle, aromas of blueberry, blackberry and currants are unleashed. The ripe, lush dark fruit flavors and oak influence combine to add depth and complexity. This bold and yet well-balanced wine finishes with a long, smooth finish. For a truly decadent treat, pair a glass with a slice of dark chocolate. SRP $38
 Perhaps no where else in America can you find better Syrah then in Washington state, and the Delille 2017 Signature Syrah is no exception. This amazing wine has a deep purple color that is enhanced by dark fruit aromas that jump from the glass. Full bodied and yet so refined with plum, licorice and tobacco flavors that are expertly interwoven with sharp acidity and long, luscious aftertaste. Wonderful with with baked stuffed chicken and French green beans. SRP $45
 For a white, the delightful 2018 Chaleur Estate Blanc is amazing. Made from Sauvignon Blanc and small amount of Semillon, this wine is bursting with aromas of gooseberry, herb and hints of pineapple. On the palate, full-bodied and quite flavorful with an abundance of kiwi fruit that only adds to this wine's depth and complexity. A clean, sharp finish leaves you yearning for more. I often chill a bottle then pair it with baked haddock and jasmine rice. SRP $35
 The recent promotions of Nick Bernstein to head winemaker and Mari Rossi as assistant winemaker are just another sign that Delille is committed to ensuring that top-notch winemaking talent remains in place. These two young people have a promising future in the wine industry and are excited to be part of the team.
 Delille wines are available locally and represent a unique wine drinking experience, one that I'm sure you'll find simply delightful. Cheers.
 Wine of the week: Torresella NV Prosecco, Italy. Light gold in color with green apple aromas made in a dry style. Soft, with a creamy fruitiness along with hints of almond on the palate. This wine is great as an aperitif or with sweets and soft cheeses. Make sure to serve well chilled. $17

I think that the general answer we saw kind of across the board in those individual markets that are more tourism centric, the Orlando, Las Vegas, I think a lot of these people are going to get reemployed. We were in a market that everyone that wanted a job could get a job. And of course, we’re looking at 30 million people unemployed in the country, but as things reopen, so I would say it kind of was broad, but you will see probably more growth than people expect as the economy reengages. And for everybody in every industry, I’m hopeful that, that takes place. I’m confident it’s going to take place for MDC because we’re at the right place at the right time with the right product and great financing. So we expect to participate in that which is going to take place.

Over 32,000 people have died from the new coronavirus in the United Kingdom, according to the Office for National Statistics, marking the first time in the pandemic that it has led Europe in the number of deaths.
 The country has surpassed Italy in COVID-19 deaths. The U.S. still leads the world in the highest number of coronavirus deaths; over 70,270 had died from the disease as of Tuesday.
 The number of total deaths recorded in the U.K. is "higher than we would wish, I think is all I can say," Angela McLean, chief scientific adviser of Ministry of Defence said during the country's press briefing Tuesday.
 McLean also emphasized that deaths in U.K. care homes have been steadily rising and said the trend was something the country "need[s] to get to grips with."
 "I don't think we'll get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over," British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Tuesday. "And particularly until we have comprehensive international data on all causes of mortality."
 Since different countries collect and report coronavirus data using different methods, the comparisons between regions are not perfect. As more time passes and more tests are conducted and more data comes in, coronavirus death rates will become more precise.

It’s still tough to have total visibility, given the fact that we’ve only recently had a return to work for those airplane makers. And they are, as you know, have been reassessing their own production plans and now that resetting their own inventories. My basic thought is that when we exited 2019, in fact, our arrears were at a higher level than we’d entered the year. And so given the arrears were so high, it would indicate that it wasn’t an even sort of vast amount of inventory in the pipeline. But I guess it will be part specific and aircraft specific. So it’s hard to give a very precise answer. But as a basic theme, if your arrears were even higher despite the massive increase in production that we did achieve and the part of the results we achieved last year, and we certainly didn’t have a big burn down of inventory and arrears in the first quarter. So I don’t know it’s going to be a massive impact. At the same time, we don’t have visibility into exactly what our customers are carrying.

 He earned his bachelor’s and medical degree from City University of New York in the 1970s, a law degree from Concord School of Law in 2012 and a master’s degree in business from Saint Leo University in 2015.
 He was “responding to a call to combat a growing epidemic of drug abuse” when he became an addiction specialist in 2015, the website said.
