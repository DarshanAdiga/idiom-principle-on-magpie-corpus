Despite a surprise run to the semifinals of the 2020 Mountain West Tournament, Edwards was fired after winning just 17 games over the past two seasons. UW has lost 20 or more games six times in program history; two of those came in the past two seasons. Edwards will be paid the remaining year of base salary left on his contract in the amount of $220,008.
 Edwards was a member of former UW coach Larry Shyatt’s staff for five seasons and took over when Shyatt retired following the 2015-16 season. Edwards’ first two years were successful, with the team winning 43 games and a CBI title in 2017.
 The Cowboys’ most obvious struggles in 2019-20 were on the offensive end, as the team ranked 335th of 350 Division I teams in points scored per game (62.7). While Maldonado emerged as a legitimate scoring threat following the graduation of star Justin James (now of the Sacramento Kings), no other UW player stepped up as consistent shot makers.
 The Cowboys shot 40.9% from the field (312th nationally) and ranked 239th in 3-point field goal percentage (32.1%). UW also struggled mightily rebounding, ranking 348th in rebounds per game and dead last nationally in offensive rebounds per game.
 In his last three seasons with Northern Colorado, Linder’s teams ranked in the top third nationally in points scored per game, including a 2017-18 season where the Bears averaged 81.1 points, which ranked 35th of 351 teams nationally.
 “I’m extremely excited for the opportunity to be the men’s basketball coach at the University of Wyoming,” Linder said. “Wyoming has a rich basketball tradition, which at a young age I was introduced to on the Sports Illustrated cover that featured Cowboys great Fennis Dembo. From that time on, growing up down the road in Denver, I was always rooting for the Cowboys.
 “For me to now have the opportunity to lead this acclaimed program is an honor that I won’t take for granted. I will work to build on the storied past built and laid before me and diligently work to make Wyoming basketball a force to be reckoned with.
 “The University of Wyoming basketball job is an incredible fit for me and my family. Having grown up in the region, and having coached in the Mountain West Conference, it was almost too good to be true when Tom Burman called me. My staff and I will make recruiting Wyoming and the region a priority while scanning the globe for student-athletes who fit the characteristics we want in Cowboy basketball players.”

The Village of Middleport is still waiting for repairs to be made on a deteriorating Erie Canal wall in the village. According to New York State Canal Corporation, repairs are scheduled for 2022, five years after the problem was brought to its attention.
 The damage has been judged as cosmetic, Canal Corporation representative Shane Mahar said, and while it may be an eyesore, the wall is structurally sound.
 Mayor Richard Wescott indicated that the village can wait. Previously he characterized the wall’s condition was “not an urgent thing,” although he pointed out that deterioration is affecting both sides of the wall.
 “They’ve got places in the canal that are potential breaches. I can’t force them, it’s their canal,” Westcott said last week.

Cosmetic repairs to the wall will be completed in a future rehabilitation project to ensure it continues to serve generations of canal users for years to come.”

The Patriots' defense next season will look much different.
 While not disclosing the terms Wednesday, the Patriots traded safety Duron Harmon to the Detroit Lions. Over the past seven seasons, Harmon provided solid leadership on and off the field as the Patriots' third safety. Nicknamed "The Closer," the 29-year-old was known for his late fourth-quarter interceptions.
 This move looks to be financial. The Patriots entered the first day of free agency with less than $4 million in cap space. By trading Harmon, the Pats clear $4.25 million off their salary cap. They're estimated to have around $7 million in cap space after the deal. But dealing away Harmon also means the loss of a beloved locker room figure and solid player in their secondary.
 Last season, Harmon started eight of 16 games played, supplementing Patrick Chung, who dealt with multiple injuries. He played 657 defensive snaps, which was the second most among Patriots safeties behind Devin McCourty. Harmon finished with two interceptions last season and had 17 career interceptions over his seven-year career in New England. A third-round pick in 2013, Harmon also added four interceptions in 17 playoff games.
 Roberts a Dolphin
 Free agent linebacker Elandon Roberts agreed to a deal with the Miami Dolphins, announcing the news on his Instagram account. He became the third linebacker to leave the Patriots this week, joining Kyle Van Noy and Jamie Collins.
 A 2016 sixth-round pick, Roberts was known as the hardest hitter in Foxboro over the last four years. He emerged as a solid run-stopping middle linebacker in 2017 (14 starts, 67 tackles) and 2018 (11 starts, 65 tackles). Last season, however the 25-year-old also displayed his versatility. After the Patriots lost fullbacks James Develin and Jakob Johnson to injuries, Roberts moved to the offensive side of the ball and played fullback.
 Roberts made 29 tackles and a sack last season. It was his lowest output on defense but that can be attributed to his dual responsibilities. Roberts played 58 offensive snaps, which marked a first in his career. Roberts' biggest highlight was his 38-yard touchdown reception in the Patriots' regular-season finale. Last year was also Roberts' first season as a captain.
 With Van Noy, Collins and Roberts gone, the Patriots will need some more linebacker/edge rusher depth this offseason. The team currently has Dont'a Hightower, John Simon, Chase Winovich, Ja'Whaun Bentley and Terez Hall on the roster.
 Miami also for Karras
 According to a source, Ted Karras has agreed to a one year, $4-million deal with the Dolphins. Karras started 15 games for the Patriots at center last season. He filled in admirably for David Andrews, who was out because of blood clots in his lungs.
 Karras, 26, was a sixth-round pick in 2016. He quickly turned into the Patriots' best interior backup on the offensive line. Karras made starts at both guard and center over his first four seasons in the NFL. Last year was his first as a starter and he was solid throughout the season. Now, he'll join Van Noy in Miami with former Patriots defensive play-caller Brian Flores, the Dolphins' coach.
 As long as Andrews can play next season, the Patriots' starting offensive line looks set, with Isaiah Wynn, Joe Thuney, Andrews, Shaq Mason and Marcus Cannon. The Pats, however, need to figure out their backup situation. Top backup tackle Marshall Newhouse and backup center James Ferentz are also free agents. The Pats placed an original-round tender on Jermaine Eluemunor last week.
 Shelton to Lions
 Danny Shelton is signing a two-year, $8 million deal with the Detroit Lions, according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus. Shelton, 26, is coming off the best season of his career, during which he was the Patriots' top run-stuffing defensive lineman. Shelton becomes the second Patriots free agent to sign with the Lions, joining Collins.
 Shelton spent the past two seasons in New England. After coming off the bench for the first time in his career, in 2018, he started 14 of 16 games played last season, lining up next to Lawrence Guy. Shelton set career highs in tackles (61), sacks (3) and tied his career high in quarterback hits (6).
 With Shelton gone, the Patriots have a big hole to fill in their defensive line. At 6 feet 2 inches and 345 pounds, Shelton represented the Pats' only true nose tackle last season. On the roster, the Patriots still have Guy (315 pounds), Adam Butler (300) and Byron Cowart (300), but they could use another bigger defensive tackle to help against the run.
 Team signs Allen
 According to a source, the Patriots are signing defensive Beau Allen to a two- year deal worth up to $8 million. A 6-foot-3, 327 pound defensive tackle, Allen fits a need after the Patriots lost Shelton to Detroit.
 The 27-year-old appeared in 13 games last year with Tampa Bay and made 10 tackles. He's a veteran of six NFL seasons.
 A seventh-round pick in 2014, Allen started his career in Philadelphia. He appeared in 63 games with the Eagles, making eight starts, in four seasons. He was a part of the Eagles team that beat the Patriots in Super Bowl LII. Allen signed with Tampa Bay in 2018 and started a career-high eight games, making 20 tackles, that season.

La France et l’Europe ont beaucoup trop tardé à prendre des mesures de protection contre le coronavirus. Et encore, celles prises ces derniers jours ne sont probablement pas assez strictes…        Alors que la Chine n’a recensé aucun nouveau cas ce jour (cela ne signifie pas que c’est terminé, mais c’est tout même une bataille de gagnée), l’Europe voit le nombre de cas augmenter de manière exponentielle.        Et il ne faut pas se voiler la face, ce sont les personnes âgées qui vont « payer » le prix de cette irresponsabilité politique, de ces décisions prises beaucoup trop tardivement, qui vont plonger l’Europe dans une situation dramatique.        Dans ce contexte sans précédent, nos ainés vont être les premières victimes du Covid-19 pour deux grandes raisons.        Tout d’abord, avec le développement du virus, les services d’urgence vont rapidement arriver à saturation en personnel et en matériel. Et il ne faut pas se voiler la face, les médecins vont devoir choisir qui soigner… Entre un jeune et un ancien, on vous laisse deviner.        Ensuite, on le sait depuis le début, les personnes âgées et/ou malades chroniques sont plus à risque. Environ 15% de décès chez les 75 ans et plus contre 2% en moyenne. Quand une maison de retraite est contaminée, malgré la mise en place du plan bleu, cela arrive et va encore arriver, les contaminations se répandent comme une trainée de poudre !

Tomando como base modelos de contagio sin intervenciones en salud pública, con una tasa de contagio de 2,68, el Gobierno calculó que casi cuatro millones de colombianos (el 8,1 % de la población) pueden resultar contagiadas por el COVID-19.Así quedó consignado en el decreto de estado de emergencia firmado por el presidente Duque del 17 de marzo de 2020, en donde también se detalla que el Gobierno prevé que el 81,5 % de estos casos serán leves; el 4,7 % críticos, y el 13,8 % severos, y calcula que la atención en el sistema de salud le costará al país 4,9 billones de pesos.Adicionalmente, el Gobierno calcula que el costo total por incapacidades será de 94.800 millones de pesos y la expansión del área de aislamiento a través de la habilitación de capacidad hotelera costará 36.000 millones de pesos. Artículo relacionado Colombia ya pasó el umbral de los 100 casos de infectados con COVID-19 “Para el cálculo se tuvieron en cuenta los casos proyectados, la distribución de la gravedad de la enfermedad, así como las canastas de procedimientos y medicamentos para cada servicio, los datos de la base de suficiencia del año 2018 y con un supuesto de 14 días de estancia en UCI y de cinco en hospitalización”, detalló el decreto.Debido a la caída del petróleo y a la incertidumbre de los mercados por la situación global el dólar en los mercados emergentes y en países productores de petróleo, el Ministerio de Hacienda de Colombia calcula que en un escenario moderado, con una recuperación parcial de los precios del petróleo hacia el final del año, el crecimiento económico se verá afectado en alrededor de un punto porcentual.Según el Gobierno, el reajuste económico que deberá realizar el país “evidencia que el sistema de salud colombiano no se encuentra físicamente preparado para atender una emergencia de salud y requiere ser fortalecido de manera inmediata”. Artículo relacionado Medidas de alcaldes y gobernadores seguirían en pie por error en decreto presidencial El decreto agrega que en el sector del turismo, uno de los más afectados, el número de visitantes no residentes caerá en marzo más de 47 % frente al mismo mes de 2019 y que en el abril la caída puede ser del orden del 80 %. En el sector aeronáutico, Colombia espera una reducción de cerca de dos millones de pasajeros mensuales y casi 2,5 millones para los meses más críticos.De confirmarse esos números supondría la práctica paralización de los viajes internacionales y una bajada del 50 % en los internos.El ministro de Hacienda, Alberto Carrasquilla, descartó este miércoles un endeudamiento del Estado para hacer frente a la epidemia y confirmó que los recursos los proveerán el Fondo de Ahorro y Estabilización Petrolero y el Fondo Nacional de Pensiones de las Entidades Territoriales (Fonpet).
