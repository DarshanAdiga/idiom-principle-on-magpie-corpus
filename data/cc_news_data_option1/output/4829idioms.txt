SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

HONOLULU (AP) — For months, Hawaii locals had Waikiki's famous beaches and other tourist hot spots to themselves as a mandatory two-week quarantine on travelers curbed tourism during the coronavirus pandemic. Residents could drive along Oahu’s famed North Shore without spending hours in traffic from tourists gawking at sea turtles or take walks along Waikiki’s main drag without having to sidestep throngs of awestruck tourists. But now officials are allowing visitors to produce a negative COVID-19 test to avoid the quarantine. Locals have long felt ambivalent about living in an island paradise that relies on visitor spending, but many saw an upshot to the health crisis — reclaiming favorite spots long overrun by crowds.

FRIDGE FIX
 AstraZeneca has said it will have as many as 200 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020. The vaccine is viewed as offering one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.
 Brazil, Mexico, India and Indonesia are likely to be the big beneficiaries of the AstraZeneca vaccine among emerging markets, Deutsche Bank said in a research note.
 But keeping any of the vaccines at stable temperatures may prove challenging.
 India is looking to five locally-tested vaccine candidates as well as Russia's Sputnik V vaccine and AstraZeneca's offering.. Investment research group TS Lombard said the country is also trying to increase its roughly 28,000 refrigeration units and 700 refrigerated trucks.
 "Even if you look at India, which in recent years has made vast strides in healthcare and pharma, how can they possibly transport a vaccine that needs refrigeration, not even considering the ones that need to be stored at 94 degrees Fahrenheit below zero, across 3.28 million square kilometres quickly enough to inoculate enough of the 1.38 billion population?" said Morrissey.
 Peru may also face difficulties, analysts say, as it has so far only secured the Pfizer vaccine, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C, although the government said earlier this month that Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca laboratories would begin trials of coronavirus vaccines.
 "With the world's third-highest rate of death from Covid-19, Peruvians will be hoping that the cold chain requirements of the vaccine they have bought are able to be relaxed," Paul Domjan, senior contributing analyst at investment research group Tellimer, wrote in a note this week.
 Russia, along with China, appear well placed with the only major home-grown vaccine research programmes in emerging markets, Domjan wrote.
 Both these countries will also ship some of their supplies overseas.
 The poorest parts of emerging markets should be covered by the COVAX global distribution scheme, co-led by the World Health Organization.
 Even so, the positive boost for emerging markets in general from the vaccine may be more than a year away.
 Citi analysts said vaccine supply may fall short of demand in most EM countries in 2021, with vaccines starting to lift most economies in the first half of 2022, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 in developed countries.
 "It may not be until the end of 2022 or even later that sufficient vaccines are available to lower-income EM economies with strained fiscal resources and limited capacity for domestic production," Citi analysts wrote in a note this week.
 Goldman Sachs has a base case scenario for herd immunity to be reached in most emerging markets between late 2021 and mid-2022, with richer economies and those with greater vaccine supply reaching it sooner.

The Perinthalmanna Municipality is witnessing a unique friendly fight between two women of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). Deviating from its declared policy of temporarily or permanently expelling rebel candidates, the IUML has given explicit approval for both women to fight it out in ward 5.
 Pattani Zareena and Pacheeri Husaina are the two independent candidates of the IUML in ward 5. Strangely, both were approved as official independent candidates of the party. “The winner will become the United Democratic Front (UDF) member,” said IUML district president Sayed Sadikali Shihab Thangal.
 The party, however, denied its official symbol to both candidates. When Ms. Zareena has mobile phone as her symbol, Ms. Husaina has got the symbol football.
 The IUML ward level committee chose Ms. Husaina as the party’s candidate, and she went ahead by accepting the deposit amount from Mr. Thangal.
 However, the municipal committee shot down her name and wanted Ms. Zareena to contest. When the issue reached Panakkad, the spiritual seat of the party, the leadership had no choice but to let both of them go for a friendly fight.
 Both women represent two party families in Perinthalmanna, where the IUML has been suffering from group rivalry for long. Both are supported by two party MLAs from the region. When Manjalamkuzhi Ali, MLA, and his followers favour one candidate, P. Abdul Hameed, MLA, and his supporters stand for the other.
 The IUML leadership appears to be nonchalant about losing the seat by going for a friendly fight, especially as the Left Democratic Front (LDF) is going for an all-out show in the ward. According to UDF leaders, ward 5 is a strong bastion of the IUML. “No matter Ms. Zareena or Ms. Husaina, the victory will be for the IUML,” said Mr. Thangal.
 ## No confusion
 Voters in the ward too have no confusion. Even hard-core IUML supporters smile at the friendly fight. “We know whom to vote for. It doesn’t matter for us,” said Mohammed Ali, a voter who refused to reveal his initials or work. But he justified the IUML leadership’s decision, saying that it was a special case.
 It is not the first time that such friendly fights has been allowed by the party. In the last civic body elections, the IUML’s A.Ahamed Kutty and N. Usman Madani had fought it out in Pathappiriyam ward of Edavanna panchayat. Mr. Kutty won the ballot and got the party recognition.

 'Un pibe, loco. Esa es la bronca más grande. No puede ser, no puede ser. Es increíble. Y parece que uno está esperando que le digan que no fue nada. Estábamos hablando todos, con el grupo (del Mundial de 1986). No quisimos adelantarnos por esto de la pandemia, porque teníamos miedo de juntarnos y de que pase algo. No pudimos hablar, ni vernos', dijo Ruggeri en el canal ESPN.
 'Dejame de joder, 60 años. Mamita, lo que nos hizo vivir este pibe. De los momentos más lindos de mi vida. De verlo ahí adentro, de la energía que te tiraba. Un crack en todos los sentidos', añadió el ahora columnista del canal deportivo.
 Para Ruggeri, Maradona era 'distinto a todos los capitanes porque encima era el mejor de todos.
 'Si había un tipo que llevaba la cinta en todos los sentidos bien puesta era este. Qué feliz nos hizo, loco. Íbamos a la selección porque sabíamos que nos gustaba, porque era Argentina, pero sabíamos que estaba este. Y no podíamos no estar', añadió.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

Yet bottom-line performance could still be impacted from a mix more in favor of retail revenue generation, as operating expenses stay high with R&D a key priority. Operating expenses have risen to just about 40% of revenues, pushing net margin further in the red; working on expanding channels and revitalizing growth in foodservice will lend itself to higher expenses, and if gross margin doesn't find rapid growth back to the high 30% range, losses could be likely throughout much of 2021.
 Back in late August, Beyond seemed overvalued, yet shares still rallied to nearly $200; now it's returned to those late summer levels after disappointing earnings. There are still uncertainties within the foodservice environment, and growth has lagged during the quarter. Q3 loss widened to $20 million from a $4 million profit in 2019, and EPS for the nine months fell YoY to ($0.45) as YTD net loss more than doubled. Beyond was expected to break into annual profitability by Q4, yet that's now most likely out of the picture with margin contraction. 2021 forward P/E is 342x, and barely below 200x forward earnings for 2022's estimated $0.65. Earnings growth is visible, but profitability has been pushed back due to the losses during Q3. Forward P/S is also extremely bloated, at 20x, as retail remains the sole driver for revenue growth as international and domestic foodservice remain challenged.
 Beyond has had a chaotic quarter, with shares moving about $70 up, then down to remain flat with mid-summer trading levels. Q3 earnings missed the mark, and profitability estimates for 2020 have been revised, pushing annual profitability back to 2021 at a smaller amount. As such, valuation remains wildly bloated, and while growth is there, the impacts to foodservice revenues leading to reliance on retail revenues could impact margins and continue to impact bottom-line performance. Innovation is a main pillar for Beyond, and continual innovation and higher R&D spend will also cut into profitability, until foodservice demand can ramp back up and allow overhead to be spread across a higher production level. Competition is quite strong, with many names willing to enter the plant-based protein market in both retail and foodservice. Beyond could still have a wild ride ahead in the upcoming two quarters as foodservice could remain impacted, and retail might stay the key driver of revenue growth, so margin contraction and dampened profitability/losses stemming from higher operating expenses could be a key figure to watch.

Coach Nick Saban of No. 1 Alabama has tested positive for COVID-19 just days before the Iron Bowl with No. 22 Auburn. Team physician Dr. Jimmy Robinson and head trainer Jeff Allen said in a joint statement that the positive test came Wednesday morning. “He has very mild symptoms, so this test will not be categorized as a potential false positive,” the statement said. “He will follow all appropriate guidelines and isolate at home.” The Crimson Tide is set to face its biggest rival Saturday at Bryant-Denny Stadium without the 69-year-old, six-time national champion coach. Offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian, a former head coach at USC and Washington, will oversee preparations within the football building and oversee the team on game day. Saban said he has had a runny nose, but no major symptoms. He had previously received a false positive ahead of the game with Georgia but didn’t have any symptoms that time. He was cleared to coach in the game after subsequent tests leading up to the game came back negative. This time appears different. “It was a PCR test which was different than the false positive that I had before,” Saban said on the Southeastern Conference coaches teleconference. \"I don't really have any cardinal signs of the virus right now. I don't have a fever, no loss of taste or smell, no fatigue, no muscle aches. “I informed the team this morning at 10 on a zoom call.

AMESBURY — A Seabrook man arraigned last month on 2017 drug offenses shortly after his release from a New Hampshire prison pleaded guilty to the charges Monday in Newburyport District Court.
 Jessie Michael Gallant, 46, of Walton Road had just served two years behind bars for selling heroin to undercover Seabrook police officers in 2017. About the same time, he also sold heroin to Amesbury police officers.
 Following his release in New Hampshire, he was arrested again by Amesbury police and charged with three counts of possession of a Class A drug (heroin) to distribute and three counts of conspiracy to violate drug laws.
 On Monday in District Court, Gallant pleaded guilty to all the charges and was sentenced to a year in jail.
 All but 26 days behind bars was suspended for three years while on probation. While out on probation, Gallant must remain drug and alcohol free with random screens and stay out of trouble with the law. Gallant remains on probation in New Hampshire, according to court records.
 The Amesbury charges date back to September and October 2017 and stem from the same investigation that led Seabrook police to charge him then. Another person, Sabi-Lee Donahue, also of Seabrook, was arrested at the same time by Seabrook police.
 In May 2018, Gallant pleaded guilty to drug distribution charges in and around Seabrook and was sentenced to 3 to 7 years in jail. Donahue also pleaded guilty and served time behind bars as well.
 Earlier this month, Donahue was picked up by Amesbury police in Manchester, New Hampshire, and brought to the same courthouse for arraignment.
 Donahue drove Gallant to the Macy Street CVS Pharmacy on Sept. 26, 2017, and Oct. 2, 2017, when he sold 3.6 grams and 4 grams of heroin to an undercover Amesbury police officer.
 A third buy took place at the former Friendly's Restaurant on Oct. 5, 2017, according to an Essex County prosecutor.
