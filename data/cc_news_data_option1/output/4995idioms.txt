ARNOT — Tucked away deep in the Tioga State Forest is one stunning waterfall — Sand Run Falls.
 There's a couple ways to get to this waterfall, but you're going to have to lace up your hiking boots either way. The easiest option, especially for less- experienced hikers, is to take a section of the Mid State Trail located just off Route 15 near Arnot, Tioga County. If you don't have waterproof boots, be warned you're likely to get your feet wet, either along the boggy sections of the trail, or at the falls.
 A nice trailhead with a good amount of parking is located just off Arnot Road, just outside the little village of the same name. To get to the falls, you'll hike three miles along a well-marked trail, which is largely flat, though rocky and boggy at certain times of the year.

Here's where things get tricky. To see the falls from below, you must hike down toward Sand Run, which you'll need to cross in order to continue. During times of high water, it may be difficult to cross. Do not cross if you do not feel safe.
 Once you've cross Sand Run, you hike over a small knoll and you'll come to a set of ropes attached to a tree, which allow you to descend a little easier, and safer, to the base of the falls, and the awesome pool. A campsite is also nestled in among the hemlocks that have a year-round view of this awesome spot.
 While there are literally hundreds of falls and cascades throughout the central Pa. region, Sand Run Falls is one of my favorites due in part to the few people who see it relative to other sites, such as Ricketts Glen or those along the Loyalsock Trail. It's also a powerfall falls that cascade over many series of rock formations before falling into a large pool.
 The Mid State Trail runs north-south from New York to Maryland and traverses some 320-plus miles. It is marked in meters, and was the first trail in the nation to use the metric system. Blazed orange, the Mid State Trail goes through several popular hiking locations in the region, including the Pine Creek area in northwest Lycoming County and R.B. Winter State Park near Mifflinburg, Union County.
 The Mid State Trail was the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources' Trail of the Year in 2019.

Musically, this album is very simple. There are some synths, pianos, and a kalimba here and there throughout the tracklist. It is quiet, serene, beautiful, and even uplifting with some chiptune songs such as “Dog” and “Cat”. But even though there isn’t much here on paper, no other “ambient” record or any soundtrack for that matter evokes the same emotional responses from me, or most people for that matter, as  _Minecraft - Volume Alpha. _While I concede that if it wasn’t attached to the top selling, and arguably the best, video game of all time, it wouldn’t have the same impact, I still want to point out that it is not easy to get emotional response from a listener, especially with a video game soundtrack. Many people have nostalgia for Super Nintendo games like  _Super Mario World_ , but nobody is going to cry while listening to the credits theme.  I personally find it hard not to get emotional when I hear the first chord of “Sweden”, and if you’re around my age, I’m willing to bet that you have memories of your childhood come flooding back when you hear it too.
