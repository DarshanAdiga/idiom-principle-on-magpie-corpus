WILMINGTON - Althea Gibson lived her life with an eye on the ball - literally.
   
 The world-renowned tennis player of the 1940s and 1950s famously had a laser focus on the game even as she played a sport that wasn't always welcoming to her as a Black woman, while also coming of age in the time of segregation.
   
 Despite those hurdles, Gibson would go on to make history as the first Black person to win a championship at Wimbledon in 1957. She would repeat it the following year, and eventually reign as the first Black person to earn a Grand Slam title in the sport.
   
 She was a trailblazer at a time when much of the country was not ready to give her the credit or even the basic courtesy she deserved because of the color of her skin.
   
 Although she was born in South Carolina and raised in Harlem, New York, Gibson spent her childhood attending school in Wilmington and training on the backyard court of Dr. Hubert Eaton, who, along with Dr. Robert Johnson, used their resources to train the talented young woman.
   
 This week's episode of the StarNews' local history podcast Cape Fear Unearthed tells the story of Gibson's journey from a rough life as a street kid to a world-class tennis player, a cultural shift that would challenge her in every way.
   
 The episode features an extended interview with Lenny Simpson, a former tennis professional coached by Gibson in Wilmington, who talks about his memories of the player and person she was, the struggles she faced and how she changed the game for every Black athlete that followed her.
   
 Simpson is the founder of One Love Tennis in Wilmington, an organization that works with at-risk children to encourage them to succeed in life through tennis.
   
 Recent episodes of Cape Fear Unearthed include a look at how the city's first colonial jail was turned into the beloved Burgwin-Wright House, the history of the region's historic cemeteries and graveyards, and the tragedy of the 1918 Spanish Influenza.

 Since the Australian Constitution doesn't mention First Nations people, many Indigenous people desire to be formally recognised in the document - a concept known as constitutional recognition.
 The Uluru Statement from the Heart, that was signed by indigenous leaders in 2017, set out that constitutional recognition should be the first priority.
 It dictates a treaty and a split 'truth telling' commission should really be set up after constitutional recognition is achieved.

The iconic _Simpsons_ character has been featured on the series for 30 years, but much like how the characters themselves never age, Apu rarely elevated above being anything other than a convenience store cashier, a formerly popular stereotype for people of South Asian descent in pop culture. The documentary highlighted why it was so problematic for one of the most famous Indian characters to be reduced to such a stereotype, but also the problems of having Hank Azaria, who is not of Indian descent, voice the character.
 Azaria himself has previously stated that his plan for the character was to leave the role behind, though _Simpsons_ creator Matt Groening confirmed that Apu is set to remain on the series.
 This is only one way in which the movie and TV industry is attempting to do right by its audiences who criticize them for long ignoring racial insensitivities.

 When HBO Max debuted earlier this year, it included _Gone With the Wind_ , a film long decried for its racist themes. In response to these issues, the service now broadcasts the film with a disclaimer about the inaccuracies of its representations, though still makes the unaltered film available. Other TV series have aimed to remove controversial elements entirely, as various episodes of _Scrubs, 30 Rock,_ and _Community_ have all been pulled from services due to their offensive qualities.
