Afghan forces have the "mastermind" behind a brutal attack at Kabul University earlier this month, Afghanistan's intelligence agency said on Saturday.


  Three gunman stormed the university's campus in broad daylight on November 2, spraying bullets into classrooms.  At least 22 people were killed and 27 more injured before Afghan forces fatally shot the attackers.


  The assault came just days after 24 people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Kawsar-e Danish Education Center in the Afghan capital.


  The so-called "Islamic State" claimed responsibility for both attacks, though top Afghan officials blamed the university attack on the Taliban.

HOOPER, Utah (AP) — The Great Salt Lake’s third-largest island, Fremont Island, was once the possible destination for thousands of new homes but will now be preserved in its natural state after being sold to an undisclosed nonprofit group. Land Advisors Organization’s Salt Lake City office announced the sale of the privately owned, 4,133-acre island on Thursday, a transaction that had been in the works for about a year, the Deseret News reported. Zach Hartman, who brokered the deal, said majority owner Gavin Dixon, of Bit Wealth, had initially contemplated a master-planned community with upward of 15,000 homes. After several trips to the island, however, Hartman said that sentiment started to fade. “It was one of the cooler islands I have been on,” said Hartman, who specializes in advising private equity investors, banks, financial institutions, developers, public entities and individual owners on either acquiring or disposing of Utah land. Hartman said the ultimate destiny for the island began to take shape after multiple trips to the hard-to-reach land mass, which is accessible via an exposed sandbar when the Great Salt Lake water level is lower than 4,194 feet in elevation. “The fun part is that we got to go out there and ask ourselves what we should do. I thought, ‘I’d like to live out here.’ Or maybe no one should come out here. We went through that iteration and we all decided the best course of action would be to go down the route where someone wanted to preserve it.” The island became part of Hooper, Weber County, when it incorporated in 2000, so any housing would have to be endorsed by town leaders. Hartman said the scale of the potential development, coupled with the island’s inaccessibility, made it difficult to envision as...
