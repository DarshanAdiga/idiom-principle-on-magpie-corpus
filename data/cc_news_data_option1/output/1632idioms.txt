When amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov discovered an interstellar comet zipping through our solar system on Aug. 30, 2019, scientists promptly turned their telescopes towards it hoping to catch a glimpse of this rare and ephemeral event. After all, no one had ever set eyes on a confirmed comet from a foreign star system, and it was clear from its projected trajectory that the alien visitor, named 2I/Borisov, would soon disappear from the sky forever.

The decision to ban flogging, which the state-run human rights commission confirmed Saturday, removes one aspect of the kingdom’s justice system that has often generated criticism abroad.
 While Saudi officials hailed the move as a bold reform by the kingdom’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, Western human rights campaigners gave more muted reactions.
 “I would not call it a breakthrough,” said Adam Coogle, a researcher at Human Rights Watch who tracks Saudi Arabia. “I would call it a positive step.”
 Dampening his enthusiasm, he said, were what he called the many other aspects of the kingdom’s justice system that remain problematic, including the ability to hold people for months without charge, execution by beheading and the lack of a unified penal code.
 “I surely hope he intends to go after the whole justice system, because it is very flawed in both regulations and implementation,” Coogle said of Crown Prince Mohammed.
 Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s few absolute monarchies and administers justice based on Shariah law. Drinking alcohol is a criminal offense, and drug trafficking often a capital crime. While stoning as a punishment for adultery and the amputation of limbs for theft remain technically on the books, they are rarely, if ever, carried out.
 The lack of a unified penal code gives judges great leeway in sentencing, and flogging was most often part of the punishment for moral crimes such as public drunkenness or what judges deemed to be inappropriate contact between unrelated women and men.
 Some of those offences are now seen as less grave in Saudi Arabia because of changes pushed through by Crown Prince Mohammed. As part of his plans to diversify the economy and open up society, he has taken the power to arrest away from the kingdom’s religious police and expanded entertainment opportunities by opening movie theatres and bringing in rock concerts, professional wrestling tournaments and monster truck rallies.
 At least in Saudi cities, it is much more common to see women socialising openly with men and not covering their hair or faces than it was a few years ago.
 Saudi officials hailed the flogging ban as part of these changes.
 “This reform is a momentous step forward in Saudi Arabia’s human rights agenda, and merely one of many recent reforms in the kingdom,” Awwad Alawwad, president of the kingdom’s human rights commission, told Reuters.
 The decision to replace flogging as a punishment with jail time and fines was made sometime this month and announced internally by the kingdom’s top court, Reuters reported.
 Floggings tended to be done with a wooden cane, the swift blows going up and down the backside of the sentenced person. In the past, they were often carried out in public, adding a social stigma to the physical pain inflicted.
 “It is meant to be more of a humiliation,” said Coogle of Human Rights Watch, adding that he had not heard of reports of injuries.
 Reports of public floggings have grown rare in recent years, either because they were being administered in prisons or not at all.
 The kingdom’s most famous flogging case was that of Raif Badawi, who ran a website that published material criticising Saudi religious figures, lauding Western legal systems and arguing that atheists should be free to state their views without being punished.
 That angered Saudi conservatives, who denounced him.
 Saudi authorities arrested Badawi in 2012 and put him on trial on charges that included cybercrime and disobeying his father. In 2014, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, fined more than $250,000, and ordered to endure 1,000 blows with a cane in weekly installments over several months.
 But a video of the first installment, in front of a mosque in the Red Sea city of Jiddah, set off international outrage and Badawi was never caned again. While he remains in prison, he has been embraced by some in the West as symbol of the kingdom’s intolerance of freedom of thought and expression. In 2015, he was awarded the European Union’s top human rights award and nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

THE Government is finalising modalities that will see primary and secondary school learners receiving lessons through radio in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted the school calendar leading to cancellation of Cambridge international examinations for May and June.      Primary and Secondary Education Deputy Minister Edgar Moyo told Sunday News in an interview yesterday that they have since reached an agreement with the national broadcaster – ZBC on having school lessons broadcast on its radio stations.      He however, could not reveal when the programme will start.      "We are not yet sure as of when the schools are going to open. That will be said by the President after consultations with the relevant stakeholders and in line with the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines.      "We, however, admit that a lot has been disturbed in our learning. As you are aware, we closed schools early and we are not yet sure of the dates of opening. We are still under lockdown. We have examination classes and we are just preparing ourselves for the realities that we are going to open schools one day. So, in that regard we have engaged ZBC and agreed to have lessons on radio for both primary and secondary classes," he said.      Asked what would happen to those that have no access to radios because of poor radio signal reception and other social factors, Deputy Minister Moyo said material would be printed and distributed to rural communities that have no access to radio.      "We are developing printed material for those that will not be able to access radio lessons. We are mindful of the rural communities who have no access so a plan is in place for them. We know that some school work has been going on, on various social media platforms accessible to learners where teachers are sending their classes work to do but that is not formal, but it is not bad. It, however, only disadvantages those learners from poor backgrounds who have no access to gadgets and we hope the teachers will take that into consideration when schools open," said Deputy Minister Moyo.      He added that the ministry was also preparing online lessons and material development through Ruzivo pushed by High Life Foundation which was a Government partner under Curriculum Development and Technical Services (CDTS).      The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, he said, was working with the Ministry of Health and Child Care to ensure there would be adherence to guidelines such as social distancing, wearing of masks and use of sanitisers when schools open.      "Teachers will have to undergo sensitisation workshops, so it's a whole lot of work that we are doing as we want to ensure a safe learning environment in our schools," he said.      Deputy Minister Moyo encouraged innovation at school level saying items such as masks could be made at schools by those doing Design and Technology.      "There is a school in Karoi called Chikangwe High that is into manufacturing masks and that is the type of innovation that we want in schools," he said.      In a statement released by Cambridge Regional Director in Sub-Saharan Africa Mr Juan Visser, the international examination board said it had cancelled the May/June 2020 examinations in all countries.

Australian Test cricket captain Tim Paine says players won't be greedy, as they wait to find out if they will be asked to take a pay cut.
 Cricket Australia has stood down the vast majority of its staff for the rest of the financial year, citing uncertainty created by COVID-19, and is in talks with the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) regarding players' pay.
 The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) dictates that CA must, by April 30, provide the ACA with a list of national contracts plus revenue estimates for 2020-21.
 Wicketkeeper Paine said the players knew they would get less pay because of the revenue sharing model they have in place with CA.
 He agreed however that the players needed to get a clearer idea of CA's financial position before agreeing to any further cuts.
 "Players need to know the absolute financial positions of the game and the players aren't going to be greedy," Paine said on ABC Radio..
 "Our livelihood, all the people associated with the ACA and the players association, their livelihood is dependent on the game of cricket being healthy.
 "So at the moment if a pay cut for us is on the cards and that keeps our game thriving well into the future, then that's something we'll certainly have to look at."
 Paine wasn't that surprised at the financial state of cricket in Australia, given what was happening with the economy and in the business world.
 "I think commercially a lot of sponsors have been pretty hard hit and it's obviously going to hit cricket Australia at some stage then as well," Paine said.
 "I think there's a bit of safeguarding towards the potential of India not coming (on a tour in December/January) which is worth something like 250 to 300 million dollars."
 Paine said he hasn't been briefed on any contingency plan if the coronavirus prevented the India tour.
 "I haven't just yet and I don't want to be. I'm hoping that they get here, that would solve a lot of issues," Paine said.
 "I know there's been some early talks with Cricket Australia and the government around the potential of what could be done, chartering planes and getting them in isolation when they get here to make sure that we can get India here.
 "But apart from that I've only heard a few things on the rumour mill about maybe New Zealand coming out and us going there."
 Paine gave short shrift to suggestions by former captain Michael Clarke that the Australians had "sucked up" to Indian captain Virat Kohli in recent years so that they would retain lucrative IPL contracts..
 "If you're going to come out with a big quote and try and take people on and cause any sort of trouble and have a crack at people, I think you name people individually and he certainly didn't," Paine said.
 "It was certainly unfounded because I was out on the field and there was no one taking it easy (on Kohli)."

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to work after recovering from a coronavirus infection that put him in intensive care, with his government facing growing criticism over the deaths and disruption the virus has caused. Johnson’s office said he would be back at his desk in 10 Downing St. on Monday, two weeks after he was released from a London hospital. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for the prime minister, said Sunday that Johnson was “raring to go.” Britain has recorded more than 20,000 deaths among people hospitalized with COVID-19, the fifth country in the world to reach that total. Thousands more are thought to have died in nursing homes. Johnson, 55, spent a week at St. Thomas’ Hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. After he was released on April 12, he recorded a video message thanking staff at the hospital for saving his life. Johnson has not been seen in public since, as he recovered at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat outside London. Opposition politicians say Britain's coronavirus death toll could have been lower if Johnson's Conservative government had imposed a nationwide lockdown sooner. They are also demanding to know when and how the government will ease the restrictions that were imposed March 23 and run to at least May 7. “Decisions need to be taken quicker and communication with the public needs to be clearer,” opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said in a letter to Johnson. “The British public have made great sacrifices to make the lockdown work,” he wrote. “They deserve to be part of an adult conversation about what comes next.” Despite the toll, which saw...

 TOPEKA -- Kansas Republican legislators weighing ramifications of a projected $1.3 billion decline in state tax revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic on Friday recommended leaders of colleges and universities and officials at K-12 school districts take a hard look at cost savings.
   
 The House and Senate budget committees met by conference call to begin getting a handle on potential budget adjustments to accommodate a steep revenue shortfall. The 2020 Legislature was to resume work Monday, but that was delayed because of health risks of exposing lawmakers to the virus.
   
 Sen. Gene Suellentrop, a Wichita Republican, said colleges and universities governed by the Kansas Board of Regents should consider following steps taken by the University of Arizona, which announced temporary pay cuts and furloughs to its 15,000 employees starting May 11 and running through June 2021.
   
 "Due to these unprecedented times, I would ask that the regents schools take a look at what the University of Arizona has done on their payroll and fiscal management," Suellentrop said.
   
 On the House side, Rep. Kristey Williams said the state's public school districts need to identify expenditure reductions resulting from Gov. Laura Kelly's executive order closing school buildings and shifting instruction online.
   
 "If I were a school district right now I would be looking for ways to save," said Williams, an Augusta Republican who chairs the House K-12 Budget Committee.
   
 Washburn University president Jerry Farley said financial impact of converting instruction to online formats, closing residence halls and the anticipated decrease in the Topeka college's tuition, tax and state appropriations would likely require more than a freeze on hiring, travel and non-essential expenditures.
   
 "We are planning to offer fall classes face-to-face," Farley said. "However, we know the virus might disrupt the semester or influence the number of students who will enroll or live on campus and thus reduce tuition revenue. We are making contingency plans for many scenarios and assessing all of our revenue streams. Nothing has been decided."
   
 On Friday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment confirmed 111 deaths, down one due to further investigation of a fatality. KDHE said there were 2,777 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Kansas, a one-day increase of nearly 300.
   
 The state is tracking a dramatic spike in testing positives in Ford, Seward, Lyon and Finney counties among people linked to meatpacking plants. The four counties now account for 855 confirmed cases. At Lansing Correctional Facility, the state said 66 employees and 57 inmates had tested positive.
   
 New federal aid
   
 The Kansas congressional delegation delivered bipartisan support for the new federal coronavirus relief package targeting small businesses struggling in the pandemic.
   
 The lone Democrat and four of the five Republicans -- U.S. Rep. Roger Marshall missed the vote because of his volunteer medical work in Kansas City, Kan. -- backed a $484 billion package that primarily refreshed the overwhelmed loan program for distressed companies. The Paycheck Protection Program loans to businesses harmed by the pandemic won't have to be repaid if owners use it to keep employees on their payroll.
   
 "In these unprecedented times, Kansas small business owners need help to pay their workers and keep their businesses afloat," said U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, the Democrat serving Wyandotte and Johnson counties. "I'm glad that we were able to pass a bipartisan bill."
   
 U.S. Rep. Steve Watkins, the Topeka Republican representing the 2nd District of eastern Kansas, said the initial phase of the forgivable loan program benefited 26,000 companies in Kansas.
   
 "Despite days of delay from the Democrats," Watkins said, "small businesses, hospitals and health care workers on the front lines will finally receive the additional support they so desperately need.
   
 Waiting in line
   
 Eric Sweeney, owner of Hayward's Pit BBQ in Shawnee, said he applied for one of the loans on behalf of his 33 employees. He attempted to borrow $160,000, but the U.S. Small Business Administration fund ran dry before his name was called.
   
 He said the stay-at-home executive order issued by Gov. Laura Kelly to moderate spread of the virus limited his restaurant to carry out and home delivery, which sliced revenue in half.
   
 "It cost me 50%," he said. "I'm blessed that I have some business."
   
 The federal legislation signed Friday by Trump also strengthened COVID-19 testing and reinforced the bottom line of hospitals.
   
 Marshall supported the relief bill but missed the vote. The physician from Great Bend wasn't in Washington, D.C., because he volunteered to work with coronavirus patients in Kansas City, Kan. It was incorrectly reported Thursday that he attended a rally at the Capitol in Topeka.
   
 "I am honored to stand with my fellow health professionals who have been on the front lines of fighting this pandemic since day one," Marshall said.
   
 Lifting farm aid cap
   
 U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts, R-Kan., were among members of the House and Senate urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to eliminate payment limits to dairy, livestock and specialty crop producers when allocating $19 billion set aside under the CARES Act to compensate farmers and ranchers for coronavirus-related damage to markets.
   
 USDA's plan was to allow producers to claim no more than $125,000 per commodity. Recipients also would limited to $250,000 per individual or business entity.
   
 "Agricultural economists have estimated over $13 billion in harm to the cattle industry and $5 billion to the pork industry due to the pandemic, with many billions more in injury to dairies, fruit, nut and vegetable producers," lawmakers said in a letter to Trump. "Relief payments should aim to indemnify as much loss as possible without restrictive payment limitations."
   
 More than 125 members of the U.S. House signed a comparable letter requesting the payment change.
   
 In terms of future federal pandemic legislation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said he opposed appropriating billions of dollars to state governments if the money would be used to fix fiscal problems unrelated to the pandemic. He suggested states could file for bankruptcy.
   
 Kelly said the next stimulus should replace state tax revenue lost in the business lockdown. Kansas fiscal analysts estimate the pandemic could cost the state $1.3 billion in tax collections through June 2021. Bankruptcy isn't a realistic option, she said.
   
 "I think it's a really bad idea," the Kansas governor said.
   
 Kansas Guard
   
 The Kansas National Guard assigned 500 members to support missions throughout the state, including logistics aid for food banks.
   
 "Because of the many business closures due to COVID-19, there are many Kansans in need of food assistance at this time," said Jeff Welshans, manager of the state's emergency operations center.
   
 The Kansas Division of Emergency Management arranged the purchase of 18,000 prepared food packets for distribution to local food banks.
   
 Ten pallets of food were picked up in McPherson on April 20 by the Kansas Department of Transportation and delivered to Wichita. The pallets are to be repacked for distribution to food banks.
   
 KDEM also purchased ingredients and supplies for 1 million meals for delivery to Kansas City, Kan., where the contents will be packaged and distributed to food banks across Kansas.
   
 Jobless checks
   
 Delia Garcia, secretary of the Kansas Department of Labor, said the agency's computer system had been modified to allow distribution of the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
   
 Individuals will be eligible for the supplemental benefit from March 29 to July 25.
   
 "This is welcome news for unemployed Kansans who need assistance immediately," Kelly said.
   
 The labor department recently said the computer system had been reconfigured to expand unemployment benefits in Kansas to 26 weeks, up from 16 weeks, based on a bill passed by the 2020 Legislature.

As oil prices have plummeted to levels never before seen, a rift has opened among the companies that extract crude.
 Some of them say state regulators should force producers to pump less in the hopes such regulation will raise prices.
 Others say no, just let the market do its job.
 While Texas, an oil-producing behemoth, is weighing the controversial idea of imposing limits, New Mexico, now an oil powerhouse in its own right, has largely stayed out of that debate.
 Depending where oil prices go and what other states decide to do, there may come a point when the state needs to take a position. But key state officials disagree on where New Mexico should go.
 The issue has come to the fore as the COVID-19 crisis — paired with an international price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia — triggered a precipitous decline. Stay-at-home orders that keep Americans from traveling have drained demand for products like gasoline and jet fuel.
 Yet oil producers continued to pump through the spring, leading to a massive oversupply — and an unprecedented crash. Early last week, that glut of crude caused oil futures to fall into negative territory for the first time ever, and despite somewhat of a recovery since then, prices remain far below profitable levels for U.S. companies.
 The decline also means New Mexico oil revenue has become peanuts compared to the hefty sums the state was taking in during the boom. One key legislator has projected oil and tax revenue will fall short of projections by as much as $2 billion for next fiscal year.
 Though global oil producers agreed to a historic production cut earlier this month, the question emerged whether oil-producing states in the U.S. should also mandate cuts to drive prices higher.
 So far, the State Land Office has issued an emergency rule allowing oil and gas companies to voluntarily shut in, or close, their wells without penalty, and regulators said many companies are doing so because they can’t ship their oil anywhere.
 Yet Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard suggested the state should go even further.
 “If there was a way for the state to have more flexibility in terms of authorizing production cuts, that would benefit us,” Garcia Richard said.
 Her views go hand in hand with the purpose of her office, which is to use state trust land to raise revenue for schools, hospitals and other institutions. With oil prices so low, its ability to do that is clearly impaired.
 “For us, we don’t want to be pulling resources out of the ground because it’s a finite resource,” Garcia Richard said. “We want it to have some value, and right now it has no value.”
 But the State Land Office doesn’t have the authority to mandate any kind of production cuts. That power resides with the state Oil Conservation Division, a part of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, which says it hasn’t made a decision on the matter. It suggested oil companies may reduce production enough on their own without the state needing to impose cuts.
 “It’s just not profitable to produce oil at negative prices or even at $15 or $20 [per barrel], and so a lot of this is happening naturally,” said Adrienne Sandoval, director for the agency that regulates oil and gas activity in the state. “We have to take all of these pieces of information into account before we decide on what sort of path forward.”
 Officials also pointed out that unlike in Texas and Oklahoma, where companies have made formal appeals, no oil producers have actually asked New Mexico to impose production curbs.
 “We’re obviously watching what Texas is doing very closely,” said Sarah Cottrell Propst, secretary of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. “But we have no requests to take a look at this.”
 There’s another piece to the puzzle, too. It turns out the Oil Conservation Division made a little-known rule change two years ago that actually bars the state from limiting production at the majority of its wells.
 To understand that change, a little history is in order.
 Laws governing oil production in New Mexico stem from the Oil and Gas Act of 1935, which, among many other things, suggests the state can impose statewide caps on oil production, as well as more explicitly allowing it to cap output at specific reservoirs or “pools” of oil to “prevent waste.”
 New Mexico did, in fact, institute a statewide order limiting production in the 1930s, when the region was dealing with an oversupply of oil, according to the state energy department. The state capped production at 58,000 barrels a day in June 1935 and by 1940 had decided to meet every month to determine production limits. Officials eventually stopped setting production levels.
 Yet the 1935 law was enacted at a time when oil wells were drilled vertically. By 2018, the Permian Basin was booming with a new type of well — horizontal drilling using hydraulic fracturing in deep shale layers.
 During the administration of former Gov. Susana Martinez, the state saw a need to modernize a wide array of its oil rules, including those governing production limits, to account for the shift in the industry.
 Because horizontal drilling doesn’t access “pools” of oil like vertical drilling does, the agency decided to modify its rules to discard any limitations on those wells, said Bill Brancard, general counsel at the energy department.
 State officials familiar with the rule overhaul said there was plenty of public notice, and oil companies were heavily involved in the process. Yet others who follow the industry said they didn’t even know production cuts had been prohibited.
 Garcia Richard, for instance, said she just found out about the change. Daniel Fine, a longtime energy analyst who was involved in state energy projects from 2013-16, also said he hadn’t known about it until recently.
 “That was a very significant change,” Fine said. “I can’t remember whether there was any hearing or discussion about it.”
 Brancard, who was involved in the 2018 process, said there was consensus.
 “That was a very small part of the rule-making, and it wasn’t really controversial at that time,” he said.
 Yet fast-forward to 2020 — when oil prices are under $20 per barrel and storage facilities are full — and the change becomes much more relevant.
 If prices fall below $10 per barrel again, and if Texas regulators decide to impose production caps, pressure could be placed on Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to take a public position on whether the state might follow suit, said Fine, an oil and gas researcher with New Mexico Tech.
 New Mexico also could feel pressure to join, he said, because it shares the oil-rich Delaware Basin with Texas, and many oil producers operate in both states.
 “If we keep moving in this direction, there’s going to be an inquiry,” Fine said. “Sooner or later, someone is going to call and say it’s a question of policy for New Mexico. What is your policy?”
 State regulators said it would be possible to change the 2018 rule without needing legislative approval, but it wouldn’t be easy.
 The process could take months,
 and it would include a public hearing and likely a consultation with state Attorney General Hector Balderas, Propst said.
 Meanwhile, the Texas Railroad
 Commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in that state, has yet to make a decision. It delayed a vote on the matter until May, with the body’s chairman saying legal questions needed to be answered before a vote could take place.
 There has been some communication between the two states. Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton, who has said his state should consider “prorating” production, reached out to Propst to let her know his body was going to have a hearing. He didn’t ask her about New Mexico’s position on the issue, Propst said.
 The three Texas commissioners did not respond to interview requests.
 Oil companies and analysts have assumed any mandatory cut in Texas “would encourage other major producing states to follow suit, and that could include New Mexico,” said Bernadette Johnson, vice president of strategic analytics for Enverus Market Intelligence, an energy industry data and software company.
 Still, she said, the market could resolve the problem on its own, as low prices have caused oil companies to shut in wells of their own volition.
 While the oil world has differing views on the issue, one thing everyone agrees on is how utterly surprising it is this debate is taking place at all.
 New Mexico was enjoying the biggest oil bonanza in its history until just a couple of months ago, and now its rig count has dropped from a high of 117 to 70 in just a few weeks.
 Might the architects of the 2018 rule changes have approached that job differently had they thought a huge oil price crash was coming?
 “I have no idea,” Brancard said. “I mean, people would be more optimistic back in 2018 that this was going to go on forever.”

Chief among those positive events, she and several others agreed, was Fridays in the Asher. The concert series organized by Mike Morris (and, before it was canceled this year, Irving Mercado) was previously housed by the Hynds Building, but switched venues in 2017. The move to the Asher was a bit rushed, but Morris said it came just in the nick of time.
 “It was the 11th hour – we had people booked,” Morris said, recalling how stressful it was to have a concert without a venue. “Then this became available, and it was such an accommodating place.”
 The space was much larger – with a capacity of around 250, whereas the Hynds was much smaller – and had a real stage for the bands to play on, which Morris thinks was one reason they were able to get bigger-name acts once the series moved to the Asher.
 Tasked with recalling his favorite FITA concert memories, Morris said two nights particularly stand out, and the first was when he hosted rock/folk singer-songwriter Matthew Santos in 2017.
 “Cool doesn’t even begin to describe that night,” Morris said. “Matt was by far the biggest name we had worked with [he’s featured on Lupe Fiasco’s hit “Superstar”], and (he’s) so extraordinarily down-to-earth and played this incredible set, then encored twice at the encouragement of the crowd. Then he ate pizza onstage and helped tear some stuff down before going out with us.”
 Morris also looks back fondly at the 2019 Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers concert, opened by Cheyenne’s own Josh Gonzales Band (and Morris himself opened for Gonzales).

Champlin Park/Coon Rapids girls hockey came into the season with a mostly young group, consisting of seven seniors, eight juniors, 15 sophomores and five freshmen.
 The Rebels (14-11-1 overall, 5-5 Northwest Suburban Conference) made strides as a group this season with a mixture of experience levels gaining postseason recognition.
 Senior captain goalie Elyia Johnson, junior forward Delaney Johnson, junior defenseman Abby Peterson, sophomore forward Abby Ness and freshman defenseman Kylie Scott all were named to the all-conference list.
 Senior captain defenseman Sarah McClellan, senior captain forward Anna Beczkalo and sophomore forward Molly Terebayza were all named honorable mentions.
 “We really had a great season and all the kids that had some postseason accolades were definitely more than deserving for what they got.” coach Jim Koltes said.
 Delaney Johnson was the leader in points for Champlin Park/Coon Rapids. She finished with 19 goals and 10 assists, including two power-play goals, two power-play assists and four game-winning goals.
 She is expected to continue to be the leader for the Rebels next season.
 “We’re super excited to have her back,” Koltes said. “I think it will just take us to another level. She’s a kid that’s just gotten better and better every year, and the kid just absolutely loves hockey. If you watch her play, she just absolutely just loves the game.”
 Delaney Johnson has already been talking to a few Division I schools amidst the new NCAA recruiting changes that doesn’t allow coaches to talk to players until Aug. 1 of their junior years.
 The recruiting process is also on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic which puts her in a holding pattern.
 Elyia Johnson, a Coon Rapids senior, made the list as the starting goalie after waiting two years behind NCAA Division III Bethel University (Minn.) goalie Baleigh Shuck. She is headed to Iowa Lakes Community College for softball in the National Junior College Athletic Association.
 Elyia Johnson finished with a .910 save percentage and a 13-11-1 record. She stopped 614 of 675 shots on goal and added four shutouts.
 “That’s a kid who busted her butt every day for two years behind Baleigh, and then when she got the chance, she was still the hardest working kid that we had,” Koltes said. “For her to get the honor was awesome and deserving.”
 Both Delaney Johnson and Elyia Johnson were also named to the CCX All-Area team, as well, this season.
 Ness collected 14 goals and 13 assists, including three power-play goals, a power-play assist and four game-winning goals.
 As a power forward, Koltes said that he and the coaching staff likes her to shoot the puck, but it all clicked this season with her amount of production. And there were even seven or eight games where she played with a slightly pulled hip flexor.
 “I don’t want to say she came out of nowhere because we knew she had some talent,” Koltes said. “It just happened for her. … We’re really excited about her coming back next year.”
 Peterson and Scott were two of the top defenseman for the Rebels this season.
 Peterson finished with seven assists, including a power-play assist. Peterson, like Delaney Johnson, is in a holding pattern for recruiting, but Koltes said that she has the potential to be a Division I player as well, and Bemidji State (Minn.) University has already called him about her.
 Koltes said that it took a while to get going this season as she took on a new role with the graduation of Hannah Lynse, who plays defense for the NCAA Division III College of St. Benedict’s (Minn.).
 “It took her a little bit to get used to the different minutes and different situations, but by just before Christmas, she was probably our shutdown defenseman,” Koltes said.
 Scott had four goals and four assists, including a power-play goal and a power-play assist.
 Koltes said that she was not only a great shutdown defenseman but was also an offensive threat.
 Koltes said that he has talked to about seven or eight Division I schools about her, despite them not being able to officially recruit her until she is a junior.
 “Kylie’s got the potential to be one of the best defensemen in the state by her junior year,” Koltes said. “She’s a really, really good hockey player.”
 McClellan was another top defenseman. She had a goal and six assists, including a power-play goal and two power-play assists.
 McClellan grew as a hockey player from a freshman to a senior, Koltes said.
 “She loves the game,” Koltes said. “She’s not a kid we ever had to worry about getting out doing this stuff. She was not a kid we had to worry about doing that stuff. She just did it.”
 Beczkalo closed her high school career with four goals and 13 assists, including a power-play goal, three power-play assists and three game-winning goals.
 Beczkalo moved back to the second line this season for leadership purposes and team strategy purposes, and Koltes said her attitude about it was “awesome.”
 “It ended up creating more and more assists for her this year on that second line” Koltes said.
 Terebayza collected 10 goals and 15 assists, including two power-play goals, three power-play assists and two game-winning goals.
 Terebayza, a Coon Rapids sophomore, is another power forward who likes to shoot the puck.
 “She’s got some pull-away speed,” Koltes said. “She’s quick and shoots the puck really well, so we are really fortunate to have her.”
 This season ended in a heartbreaking 3-2 loss in triple overtime in the 5AA section quarterfinal against Anoka/Spring Lake Park.
 The seniors graduating will be missed with three of them earning postseason awards, but there will be a strong core back next season.
 Koltes said there is excitement for the future with the girls coming back next season.
 Goaltending is an unknown, but the program has girls that can step up, Koltes said. Elyia Johnson didn’t play a lot of minutes behind Shuck last season, and she stepped well with a postseason award.
 Koltes said he expects the two or three players that will compete for the position next season to either split the job or someone to win the job.
 It also helps to have Peterson, Scott and junior Alaina Hedlund on defense, Koltes said.
 “We kind of have some kids in place to help out the goaltending a little bit earlier in the year and let the goaltenders settle in, and I think we will be in good shape,” Koltes said.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte vowed Sunday to reopen schools by September and allow many businesses to resume in a week's time as the country emerges from a near-total shutdown.
 Conte told La Repubblica newspaper that he will spell out the full details of how Italy will ease its way out of the world's longest active coronavirus lockdown by the start of next week.
 He has reportedly been presented with a cautious proposal that involves a gradual lifting of restrictions over the course of May.
 Italy's official death toll of 26,384 is Europe's highest and only second globally to the United States.
 But its number of cases has been ebbing and Italy believes its contagion rate -- reported at between 0.2 and 0.7 -- is low enough below the key threshold of 1.0 to try and get back to work.
 "We cannot continue beyond this lockdown -- we risk damaging the country's socioeconomic fabric too much," Conte told La Repubblica.
 \- 'Very high risk' -
 Italy gradually closed everything over the first half March as it became increasingly clear that an initial batch of cases in northern areas around Milan was spreading.
 Scientists now believe that Italy's infections probably began in January -- if not earlier -- and that the virus was running rampant by the time the first official COVID-19 death was recorded on February 21.
 But Italy's health care system held the line and Conte now appears to feel safe enough to focus on mending an economy that his team expects to shrink by eight percent this year.
 Conte said his government will "allow a large number of companies" to restart on May 4.
 Italy's schools were closed before most other businesses and will now be one of the last to reopen.
 He said the return to school was filled with peril because many teachers were older and at greater risk of catching the virus.
 "Schools are at the centre of our attention and will reopen in September," the premier said.
 Conte explained that resuming tuition before then involved "a very high risk of contagion".
 \- 'Greater freedom' -
 Many Italians are most concerned about when they will finally be able to walk in parks and jog without being stopped and fined by the police.
 Italy's stay-at-home orders were announced nationally on March 9 and require everyone to stay within about a block of their front door.
 Many have turned their roofs into improvised gyms and even tennis courts in a collective effort to avoid going stir crazy.
 "We are not yet in a position to restore full freedom of movement, but we are studying a relaxation of the current, strict regime," Conte said.
 "We will make sure to allow greater freedom of movement while maintaining our guarantee to prevent and contain contagion."
 Media reports say the government might allow people to move freely within cities but limit their travel between the country's 20 regions.
 Conte was also reportedly considering the option of outfitting airports and train stations with thermal scanners that can flag people who are running fevers.
 But Conte cautioned against expecting bars and restaurants to open their doors in May -- or tourists returning this summer.
 "We will be reviewing our social distancing rules," said Conte.
 "But this does not mean that we will be abandoning them."

TESTING of Covid-19 at the National Tuberculosis Reference Laboratory at Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo might grind to a halt as it has emerged that Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that workers put on when conducting tests has run out.      The centre started testing for Covid-19 (Corononavirus) on 13 April and is one of the only two centres in the country. The other testing centre is the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory in Harare. Workers at the centre revealed yesterday that they have run out of PPE and if no supplies are made by today, testing would stop with effect from tomorrow. They raised concern that part of the equipment was allocated to areas that did not need sophisticated protective equipment like security guards.      Chairman of the National University of Science and Technology Applied Genetics Testing Centre, Mr Zephania Dlamini who is part of the team leading the testing at Mpilo said the situation was dire.      "We are left with five suits only to work with. We received 10 suits yesterday (Friday) and used five today (yesterday). We cannot have any results coming from this centre if there is no protective equipment. People cannot work," he said.      However, contacted for comment, the Minister of Health and Child Care, Dr Obadiah Moyo, said there was no need for panic as there was enough PPE for hospitals.      "There is plenty of PPE that has arrived in the country and is being dispatched as we speak from Natpharm in Harare. I visited Natpharm this morning (yesterday) and all hospitals are going to get their share of PPE. They were preparing to ship out the consignment to various destinations across the country. The people at Mpilo should not worry too much, by tomorrow, their consignment should have been delivered," he said.      Bulawayo Provincial Medical Director Dr Welcome Mlilo said the hospital administration could have misallocated the equipment, with some of the critical equipment sent to the main hospital and given to among others, security guards. He however, could not reveal how many PPE sets were given to Bulawayo hospitals by Government, which sourced the equipment and also received donations from various organisations.
