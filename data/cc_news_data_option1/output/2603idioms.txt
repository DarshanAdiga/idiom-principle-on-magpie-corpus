With a range capacity of just over 100km, and making use of a smokeless propellant, the indigenously built Astra missile compares with the finest in the world. It is designated as an 'All Aspect, All weather' weapon, providing the Air Force and the Navy tremendous versatility. The Astra also has state of the art ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) features, along with 'Lock on Before Launch' and 'Lock on After Launch' features. The latter feature allows the missile to identify and lock on to its target independently once it has reached within 15km of it, allowing fighter jets to waste no time and simply, 'shoot and scoot.' Moreover, the Astra is also able to withstand forces in excess of 30g, making it one of the most reliable weapons in aircraft combat.
