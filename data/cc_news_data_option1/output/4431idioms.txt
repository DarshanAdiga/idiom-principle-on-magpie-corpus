Dawa means medicine in Kiswahili. If you've come down with a little cold, you could drink a warm one smothered in honey to soothe your throat. If you're heartbroken or feeling down, a spicy one could do the trick. People even drink dawa to relieve toothaches. It's kind of like the hot cup of tea that we drink here in the States when we are feeling a bit under the weather.

get the case of Jonathan Irons dismissed and to get him released from prison. And so I think that what you see there is a pattern of commitment to social justice, particularly racial justice, from the WNBA. It's not as just one person, but as a team, as a league. And that has really been the blueprint for some of the collective action that we're seeing now. I think it's important not to let that get lost in the conversation.

Richard Hilliard March 20, 1946 - October 23, 2020 Cayucos, California - Richard Hilliard died peacefully in his home on October 23, 2020 surrounded by family. The Man… the Myth… the Legend. For those of you who knew "Showtime!"...Richard or Dick Hilliard then you were one of the lucky ones to know true friendship, true integrity and true spirit. Richard (Dick) Hilliard was born March 20, 1946. Richard (Dick) was the only child of Richard and Maxine Hilliard of Cayucos. Dick was fifth generation to be born and raised in Cayucos and is survived by his loving wife Gail Hilliard, his son Mark Hilliard, daughter in-law Christy Hilliard, and grandchildren Kylie Hilliard and Kalvin Hilliard. Dick, Dickie, Pops or Papa Hill was a fun loving and charismatic character who encompassed the true history of Cayucos and gave value to small town living. If you knew him, you loved him (he made sure of that!) This part time cowboy loved to fish, hunt and have fun. Dick was a passionate hunter, a working cowboy and an avid fisherman. He enjoyed numerous out of state hunting trips, trail rides, round ups and entertained many Mexico and Alaska fishing trips. He valued the hunt, the catch and had a deep respect and value for nature but most of all Dick cherished the time he spent with friends during each expedition. One of Dick's greatest joys was sharing his love of fishing with his grandchildren and son aboard the Ms. Mackey named after his mother Maxine. Richard (Dick) Hilliard, a Cayucos native, graduated Coast Union High School in 1964. He was an active athlete and continued his love of competition, sports and comradery and played football at Coalinga College. Dick had a tireless work ethic and there is nothing that he worked harder at than winning the love of his beautiful wife Gail. Gail and Dick were married June 15, 1968 and soon welcomed their only child Mark in 1970. A dedicated father and husband, Dick dabbled as entrepreneur in owning a gas station and a tow truck company. Eventually Dick found his true passion as a dedicated employee of PGE. Dick dedicated his professional career to PGE and worked as a lineman dedicated his life's work to his crew brotherhood. For those that know and love Dick they will remember his contagious smile, his charm, his loyalty to family and, his gigantic heart and his deep heart to heart talks (if you have been lucky enough to know…. you know.) Dick will be remembered as a fixture of the growth, development and heritage of Cayucos. He has had the privilege of seeing his son and grandchildren grow and thrive in this beautiful community. We ask that in lieu of flowers or gifts; contributions be made to Central Coast Hospice. We are deeply grateful to the loving and knowledgeable care providers and team of nurses that cared for Dick during his final days. Richard (Dick) Hilliard will be remembered as a dedicated husband, a loving father, the best Papa and the truest friend anyone could have. He will be deeply missed and cherished for the life lessons and legacy he has left behind. Love you Pops!! See you on the flip side.

Aumenta o decresce in proporzione alla possibilità che il percettore ha di trovare lavoro. Ad esempio chi riesce a sottoscrivere un contratto a tempo indeterminato ha diritto all’importo massimo di 5000 euro. Il beneficiario ha l’obbligo di spendere la somma di denaro spettante presso un Centro per l’impiego e di frequentare corsi professionalizzanti. Ciò perché l’assegno di ricollocazione mira al reinserimento lavorativo del soggetto che riceve il sussidio. Per richiedere l’assegno occorre recarsi al Centro per l’impiego e sostenere un colloquio per valutare le attitudini professionali e le possibilità di occupazione.

WELCH — Speed, pure and simple, made the difference for the Mount View Golden Knights on Friday as they celebrated homecoming night on their brand-new field with a 26-0 win over county rival River View.
 “That’s my Christmas wish — early,” said Mount View head coach Maurice Gravely. “We needed that win. … Give (River View) all the credit. They fought us hard.”
 Fireworks lit up the sky above Tom’s Mountain following the pregame homecoming festivities and after each score on the artificial turf at new Vic Nystrom Stadium.

Parsons, who also had a 71-yard interception return on the night, led the receivers with six catches for 136 yards, including scoring receptions of 38 yards, and 28 yards.
 Greenbrier East only trailed 21-6 when the Spartans defense recorded a big stop of its own with 7:35 remaining in the second quarter. Parsons had what would have been his biggest TD play of the night called back on a flag that Pedigo protested to no avail. Moments later, Cochran hit Carter Meachum for a 67-yard catch-and-run that took the starch out of East for keeps.
 “I don’t know if [East] held the momentum, but you could tell they were trying to swing it their way. Then we were able to come back and make that play and Carter was able to take it the distance. I thought that was a pivotal play for us in the first half,” said Pedigo.
 On a subsequent second quarter drive, Honaker caught a short pass from Cochran and parlayed it into Princeton’s longest play from scrimmage this year — a 97-yard scoring pass and run for the 35-6 halftime lead.
 To go with his offensive kudos, Powell rushed for 109 yards on 15 carries for the Tigers, including scoring runs of 37 and 8-yards.
 The Princeton head coach was a bit less effusive with his praise for the offensive unit than he was with the defense. The system has been producing big numbers and scoring points all season long. He was more concerned with correcting some less-obvious but bothersome execution issues that might haunt the Tigers in the post-season if not addressed.
 “I thought Greenbrier did a good job. We didn’t really establish a lot of drives, but we had a ton of big plays,” Pedigo said.
 The Tigers were slated to wrap up regular season play with Hedgesville at home next Friday, but Berkeley County remains in what has been a prolonged period of Code Orange. Princeton quickly arranged a game at George Washington for Friday.
 “With tonight’s win, I think we’re in the playoffs. And if we have the ability to play next week, I think we ought to play,” Pedigo said.

Jackson found out about the run on Facebook, he said, and entered to keep tuned up for a return to marathon races.
 “The coronavirus put everything on hold,” he said. “So it’s a chance to get out and run.”
 Improving as a competitive runner is “all about consistency,” he said. “The only way to get better is to compete.”
 He said that he and Murphy “were pretty much neck and neck” through the first part of Saturday’s race, and he pulled away as he got used to tackling the many hills on the course.
 The top female finisher in the 5k was Rachel Crews of Princeton. Her time of 28:53 was 5 seconds ahead of another Princetonian, Hannah Folmar.
 Crews’ only previous Pumpkin Run appearance was nine years ago, but she is an avid runner.
 “I’ve just run my whole life. I enjoy it,” she said. “It’s how I clear my head.”
 The competition aspect adds to her experience. “It gets the adrenaline going,” she said. “It pushes you harder and further.”

tiu că voi credeți că aici s-a atins o culme a incompetenței, dar stați un pic să vă mai spun. Ei bine, guvernanții noștri, când lovesc Europa, o lovesc exact acolo unde o doare. De exemplu, în moalele coridoarelor europene de transport feroviar de marfă. Ca să vă faceți o idee despre cât de distructivi suntem atunci când ne punem mintea cu Europa, aflați că noi vrem să le impunem trufașilor de la UE să transporte marfa pe la noi cu viteze de 30-40 km/h pe o linie ferată neelectrificată, Cluj Napoca – Oradea, unde, din cauza furtului de cabluri, se mai dă jos din tren mecanicul pentru a schimba macazul manual. După care, trenul european de marfă e pus să se târască cu 15 km/h de la Sighișoara la Brașov, unde abia acum 6 luni s-a semnat un contract de modernizare în 4 ani, dar unde încă nu s-a apucat nimeni de treabă. Și-uite așa ajunge târâș-grăpiș trenul la Brașov, de unde se va îndrepta către Predeal în vârfurile degetelor, pâș-pâș, că porțiunea aia nici nu s-a scos la licitație. Nu s-a scos pentru că toată funcționărimea genială din Ministerul Transporturilor se sperie de ideea că acolo trebuie construit un tunel și nu mai are nimeni curaj să construiască tuneluri în România, în anul 2020! În fine, trece trenul din Predeal și ajunge să meargă de la Ploiești la București, pe o secție „ _state of the art”_ , a treia din Europa echipată cu ETCS nivelul 2. Numai că ar putea ea să fie echipată și cu tehnologie spațială, România nu are locomotive echipate la bord cu echipamentul de dirijare a circulației ETCS. De la București pleacă trenul pe magistrala București-Constanța, mândria căilor noastre ferate. De unde se tot furau echipament scumpe, așa-numitele dulapuri de bloc (aparatura de dirijare a circulației dintre stații), până când cineva a avut o idee simplă: să pună niște GPS-uri în câteva dulapuri să afle poliția unde ajung echipamentele cu cupru când ajung. Și ce să vezi, minune-mare, hoții au furat toate dulapurile cu echipamente, mai puțin pe alea cu GPS. Probabil că au mirosit GPS-ul…

Mattie Ruth (Smith) Hillier, 84, passed away on October 28, 2020, in Hillsboro. A memorial service will be held at 11:00 AM, at the Sun Country Chapel in Whitney, Texas on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, with Robert Hillier officiating.      Mattie was born in Amarillo, Texas, on January 19, 1935, to Harry and Katheryn (Gladman) Smith. The family soon moved to Springer, New Mexico where she was raised. She graduated from Springer High School in the spring of 1953 and attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas as a nursing student in the fall of 1953. She became ill at the end of her first semester, returned home and did not return to Baylor.      In 1951 she met a handsome young man in Amarillo who was the son of friends of her grandparents who lived in Amarillo. They dated and later married on September 12, 1954. Following their wedding, Ronald Lee Hillier took Ruth, as she preferred to be called, to Lubbock, Texas for his junior year at Texas Tech University.      In August of 1955, Ruth gave birth to a tiny baby girl born six week premature. Ruth worked to finish putting Ron through school and upon graduation in May 1956, Ruth, Ron and baby daughter, Rhonda Lee moved to Pasadena, Texas for Ron to attend flight school. Ron was a member of the Air Force ROTC at Texas Tech and following flight school, he entered the active military as a second lieutenant. He was stationed overseas in Germany and in October of 1957, Ruth and Rhonda followed him there, much to Ruth's dismay.      While in Germany, Ruth gave birth to the couple's second child, a boy this time, Richard Craig, on October 11, 1958. In September of 1959, Ruth, Rhonda and Craig flew home to New Mexico while Ron completed his active duty.      When he returned home, he moved his family to Amarillo where began his career as a Civil Engineer with the Texas State Highway Department.      As her children got older, Ruth worked as a costume director for the Amarillo Little Theatre, managed the Esquire Movie Theater and even ran for the Mayor of Amarillo at one time.      She was an avid reader and loved to read and teach the Bible. She and Ron also loved RVing and square dancing. In November of 2005, they moved to Whitney, Texas and soon after arriving, her health began to fail. She battled breast cancer, underwent two knee replacements, a hip replacement, open heart surgery, congestive heart failure and surgery for a broken ankle. Following all of these health issues, dementia took its toll on her creative and artistic mind.      She is survived by her husband, Ronald Hillier; her daughter and son-in-law, Fred and Rhonda Carriker of Sachse, Texas; her son and daughter-in-law, Craig and LeAnn Hillier of Amarillo; granddaughter and husband, Cara and Ryan Aldrich of Sachse; a granddaughter and husband, Casi and Chris Carter of Richardson, Texas; a grandson and wife, Cody and Katherine Carriker of Richardson, Hope Hillier of Amarillo and Robert Hillier of Waco; three great- granddaughters, Marin, Madeline and Maeley Aldrich; and her brother and sister-in-law, Richard and Trevanion Smith of Sugar Land, Texas.

Según comenta Patricio Portaro, gerente general Directo, el golpe que el COVID-19 ha ocasionado a la industria aerocomercial también se ha trasladado a la compañía de taxis que él dirige. “Los viajes hacia y desde el aeropuerto coinciden con la caída del flujo de pasajeros de las aerolíneas”, indica. Así, durante setiembre solo el 5% de los servicios tuvieron como punto de partida o llegada el terminal. Y si bien para octubre la proporción podría ser de 10%, está muy por debajo de lo registrado el 2019, cuando el 90% de los viajes de Directo provenían del aeropuerto Jorge Chávez, pero también de bases localizadas en centros comerciales, que es otro rubro severamente afectado por la pandemia. Frente a la “nueva normalidad”, Directo ha adelantado hasta cuatro años su plan de digitalización previsto y ahora da prioridad a los traslados solicitados a través de su app, que actualmente representa el 90% de los traslados. En total, el impacto de la pandemia en el negocio de Directo ocasionará una caída de hasta 15% en los ingresos anuales para el 2020. Sin embargo, la rápida adaptación a la demanda digital le permitirá a la compañía alcanzar, en el escenario más optimista, un crecimiento de hasta 75% si es que a este nuevo segmento se suman condiciones de mercado que permitan un retorno a los canales presenciales de manera usual. Tras la pandemia, los pasajeros también han modificado sus hábitos de consumo. Uno de los cambios más destacados es que Directo ahora recibe un 30% más de viajes largos que en años anteriores. “Observamos una menor cantidad de servicios cotos y mayor frecuencia en solicitudes de traslados largos. Al parecer, el público está buscando otras alternativas para trayectos reducidos y prefieren caminar, ir en bicicleta o usar sus vehículos propios”, considera Portaro. Antes, los viajes de Directo duraban en promedio 60 minutos y, ahora, pueden llegar hasta los 90 minutos. De otro lado, Portaro comenta que los servicios solicitados a través de la app para terceros han pasado de representar casi el 0% a cerca del 20% del total. “Solía ser muy raro que alguien coordine un viaje por otro, pero ahora los hijos piden traslados para sus padres, por ejemplo”, indica. La demanda de servicios de courier (envíos de objetos) repuntó y, durante los meses de abril y mayo pasados, alcanzó hasta el 40% de los viajes. Hoy, esta opción se ha consolidado y ya representa entre el 20% y el 25% de los pedidos. Con la finalidad de minimizar el riesgo de contagio por COVID-19, Directo implementó en sus 1,000 vehículos el pago por QR a través de Niubiz y ahora las transacciones en efectivo son prácticamente nulas, pues los pasajeros buscan evitar el contacto a toda costa. De otro lado, para crear un entorno lo más seguro posible para los usuarios, Directo ha instalado luces ultravioleta en sus vehículos y, comenta Portaro, espera cubrir todas las unidades en los próximos 30 días.
