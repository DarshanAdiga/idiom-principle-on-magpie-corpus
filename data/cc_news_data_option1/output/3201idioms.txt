“‘Disloyal’ is the most devastating business and political horror story of the century,” according to a Skyhorse statement shared with the AP. “It is a story that you haven’t read in newspapers, or on social media, or watched on television.

The skeptics are certainly right to point out that events in May and June can't be the cause of events in January or February. Indeed, as I noted, Charlotte's murder rate went up more in 2019 than in 2020. These are complicated matters, to say the least. But it strains credulity to argue that adverse pressure on law enforcement isn't a significant part of the problem.

Indeed, the best endorsement for letting Russell cook may be the strong likelihood that Seahawks’ opponents would be ecstatic if they kept the QB’s burner on low heat. With Tyler Lockett, DK Metcalf and newly acquired Phillip Dorsett in the receiving corps, and a deep group of talented tight ends to go with Chris Carson and the other running backs, they have all the makings of an explosive, diversified offense.
 And Wilson — who advocated in the offseason for the Seahawks to add "superstars" — seems to be itching for a chance to be creative with those ingredients. As always, Wilson was a fount of positivity in the Zoom call. He said he wakes up every day thinking about being great. He said he’s found a way to not only slow down the game, but slow down his life — one enriched by the birth of a son, Win Harrison Wilson, last month. He believes he’s just hitting his prime, and reiterated a much-state desire to play “10, 15 more years.”

RENTON — Russell Wilson didn’t don an apron and a chef’s hat for his first Zoom news conference since training camp began. But the Seahawks’ quarterback didn’t exactly slam shut the oven door on the Twitter sentiment that boiled throughout the offseason:
 _Let Russ Cook._
 For the uninitiated, that phrase, preceded by a hashtag, is a plea to Pete Carroll to take the shackles off Wilson. To lessen the coach’s long-standing reliance on the running game in order to accentuate the team’s best asset — Wilson with the ball in his hands.

 # Florida inmate coronavirus infections, deaths soar amid pleas for more help
 By Ana Ceballos
 News Service of Florida
 TALLAHASSEE — As the numbers of COVID-19 deaths and infections in prisons soar, workers, inmates and their loved ones continue to plead for help from the state.
 Gov. Ron DeSantis said Thursday the Florida Department of Corrections, which is part of his administration, will continue to test and isolate symptomatic inmates. But he did not outline any other measures under consideration to prevent infections among inmates and staff members.
 “They are going to continue going through the testing regime, but I think the main thing is just isolating the folks who are symptomatic and likely to be spreading it, and I know they’ve worked hard to do that,” DeSantis told reporters at a news conference in Tallahassee.
 As of Thursday, 14,271 state inmates had tested positive for COVID-19, a number that has skyrocketed since mid-July, when 2,591 prisoners had tested positive for the virus.
 Prison deaths tied to the novel coronavirus have also soared by 165 percent since mid-July. The virus had killed 75 inmates and two corrections officers, Joseph Foster and Robert Rogers, as of Thursday.
 Since the pandemic started in March, criminal-justice reform advocates and state lawmakers have warned that correctional facilities will be vectors in the pandemic because they are often crowded, with social distancing nearly impossible. The advocates have called, in part, for trimming the prison population by releasing certain non-violent offenders who are at risk of contracting the virus or prisoners who have a few months left in their sentences.
 “There are some number of people who can be released safely into the community, and we can protect them from COVID-19, we can slow the spread inside prisons, and we can slow down the spillover from prisons to the community by releasing them,” Greg Newburn, the Florida executive director of the group Families Against Mandatory Minimums, said in a recent interview.
 Democratic state lawmakers held a conference call Thursday to urge DeSantis and Corrections Secretary Mark Inch — who also recently tested positive for COVID-19 —- to do more to protect prisoners and workers.
 “People need to realize these are real people with real lives and that we are giving death sentences to people who would have been released. They are dying in our facilities,” state Rep. Dianne Hart, D-Tampa, said during the call.
 But DeSantis has been reluctant to release inmates as a response to the pandemic, saying in April that he did not think the move “make a lot of sense.”
 Outbreaks have occurred at prisons throughout the state, including in many rural areas where prisons are major employers.
 During the past week, for example, the Department of Corrections has issued news releases about how it is dealing with large numbers of cases at five prisons. They are Lowell Correctional Institution, which had 992 inmate cases as of Thursday; Suwannee Correctional Institution, which had 806 inmate cases; Century Correctional Institution, which had 759 inmate cases; Taylor Correctional Institution, which had 613 inmate cases; and Baker Correctional Institution, which had 561 inmate cases.
 At least 14 inmate deaths are tied to South Florida Reception Center in Miami, while eight have involved inmates at Dade Correctional Institution, according to Florida Department of Health numbers. In addition, 2,185 corrections workers have tested positive statewide, with the Department of Corrections saying Wednesday that 1,160 had been cleared to return to work.
 The response to the pandemic in prisons is a stark contrast to efforts to halt the spread of the virus in other high-risk facilities, such as nursing homes.
 As the virus threatened the state’s senior population, the governor quickly implemented policies to protect residents at long-term care facilities. DeSantis, for instance, has touted facilities where nursing-home residents can be moved if they test positive for COVID-19.
 “I will say one of the things that’s been very helpful in mitigating these outbreaks has been our COVID-only nursing facilities,” the governor said, noting they are key to being able to fully isolate positive residents. “They need to be isolated, most facilities can’t appropriately isolate them.”
 In state prisons, visitation have been suspended since March. But there are no testing requirements for workers, who can transmit the virus. And employees, who are fearful about working in prisons with COVID-19 outbreaks, have complained about a lack of protective gear and a lack of testing.
 Speaking to reporters on Thursday, DeSantis said he did not think the mitigation efforts in nursing homes would work in prisons.
 “Obviously, when you are talking about a prison, there is a much more challenging situation that you are dealing with in terms of finding alternative facilities,” he said. “I mean, they are isolated within the existing framework that they have, and we’ve obviously encouraged them to do it.”
 DeSantis said the state has devoted significant resources to test the state’s roughly 87,700 inmates. As of Thursday, the state had conducted 74,795 tests on prisoners, with 3,560 pending results and re-tests.
 “We’ve dedicated a lot of testing resources to the prisons,” DeSantis said. “If nursing homes have been the most robust target for us in terms of testing, I would say prisons have been second just in terms of the amount of resources.”
 DeSantis has not addressed calls from workers for additional benefits, such as hazard pay for corrections officers who are asked to work longer hours at prisons with COVID-19 cases.
 “Corrections officers, statewide and nationally, are testing positive for COVID-19 and unknowingly bringing danger into their homes. The danger of the coronavirus is something once again never contemplated and certainly not addressed in any collective bargaining agreement or state law,” Jim Baiardi, who leads the state corrections chapter of the Florida Police Benevolent Association, wrote in a July 30 letter to Inch.

If we can figure out ways to clean up space junk, we can use satellites with less guilt. NASA’s e.DeOrbit project is focusing on seeking out and removing satellite debris in the upper reaches of the ionosphere. Meanwhile, the European Space Agency is hard at work on its own “capture mechanisms” to pick up space debris such as nets, harpoons robotic arms and tentacles. Only time will tell if these technologies can help restore the heavens above—or at least the ionosphere—to a more pristine state.
