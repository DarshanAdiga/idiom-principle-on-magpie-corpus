Ireland face a Nations League relegation decider against Bulgaria on Wednesday night after their desperate winless run continued in Cardiff.
 David Brooks ensured it would be yet another defeat for Stephen Kenny’s men after his second-half header made it eight games without a victory.
 After showing promising signs during the first 45 minutes, Ireland faded and finally succumbed to the Welsh pressure, while failing to score for the sixth game in a row.
 While Wales set up a Nations League promotion decider against Finland, it’s a whole different story for Ireland, who must now avoid defeat against Bulgaria to remain in the second tier after a dire run.
 This Celtic clash was a crucial one for Kenny’s underperforming side with World Cup qualifying seedings on the line.
 There was also the small matter of avoiding relegation into Nations League C and trips to the likes of Albania, Kosovo, and Armenia.
 After watching his side go five matches without scoring, Kenny turned to 19-year-old Adam Idah, Robbie Brady, and James McClean - who scored Ireland’s only goal the last time they tasted victory in Cardiff in 2017 - to break Ireland’s hex in front of goal.
 Kevin Long also came into the starting XI in a bid to stop the rot and earn a first win in eight matches.
 But to do so Ireland would have to stop a daunting Welsh attack they knew all too well. Gareth Bale was back and according to stand-in manager Robert Page, was the "fittest he has ever been" after regaining match sharpness at Tottenham.
 Manchester United flyer Daniel James and Bournemouth winger David Brooks were in support as Page set his side out in a 3-4-3 formation.
 Ireland started brightly and captain Shane Duffy spurned an early opportunity after diving to meet Brady’s free-kick, but he failed to steer his header on target.
 Brady was next to go close when he fired over from the edge of the area after Wales had scrambled the ball away from goal.
 The signs were promising for a seemingly rejuvenated Ireland side, but they got a reminder of their opponents’ threat after Kevin Long gifted the ball to Brooks on the edge of the box.
 He had his teammate Jayson Molumby to thank for providing a crucial intervention to block Brooks’ shot out for a corner.
 Then it was Bale’s turn to threaten the Irish goal as momentum began to swing the way of the hosts. The Spurs star launched a dipping free-kick towards goal from 30 yards out and watched it graze the top of the crossbar before going behind.
 The scare only seemed to spark Ireland into life. Moments after the close shave, Brady chipped the ball into the path of McClean, who forced a reaction save from Danny Ward with a forceful low effort.
 Wales looked to assert control after the restart but were met with stuff resistance from Ireland’s solid rearguard.
 It looked for a moment as if the breakthrough would come from the spot when the newly introduced Kieffer Moore went down in the box under pressure from Duffy. Referee Petr Ardeleanu blew his whistle, but only to award Ireland a free-kick and issue Moore with a yellow card for simulation.
 But the defensive resolve was finally broken in the 66th minute when Daniel James clipped a cross towards the back post, where it was met by Bale, who beat Spurs teammate Matt Doherty to head back across goal for the onrushing Brooks to head in from close range.
 Brooks should have made it 2-0 after breaking clear on a rapid counter-attack, but Ireland goalkeeper Darren Randolph made a stunning left-handed stop to keep the one-goal deficit in tact.
 Ireland had a penalty shout turned down when Neco Williams seemed to hand a corner at the near post, but there was more agony to come.
 The final blow came in added time as Ireland as they lost midfielder Jeff Hendrick for the crucial clash on Wednesday evening. Wales substitute Tyler Roberts cut out a weak pass and looked set to sprint clear through on goal until Hendrick scythed him down and saw red.

But in an effort to try and see what Esparza is getting at, if Abraham did in fact agree to allow Esparza the rights to any and all expressions that would feature his daughter, and it was drawn up with a legally-binding agreement, then Abraham might be in a little trouble. But then one has to wonder at the duration of this agreement and what special stipulations might have been added in, if any. There are just too many things to consider to start talking about who's in the right and who's in the wrong, especially since such a deal that Esparza is talking about feels like something that only favors him unless he was willing to continue to push the legend of Selena throughout the years. It's easy to say that the movie back in the 90s was something that people enjoyed and loved since Selena was a young woman that took the world by storm with her charm and style of music, and it was more than obvious that she had a lot left to offer, but her untimely death hit the world hard enough that it likely took time to recover. But if Esparza and Abraham had a deal, perhaps there are more parts to this deal that haven't been made clear yet. It does feel entirely unlikely that, in the face of a pending lawsuit such as this, that Netflix would throw caution to the wind and start developing something that they had no legal right to.

 NYPD Sgt. Anwar Ishmael told CNN the alleged assailant has been charged with second-degree assault. The NYPD said the attack occurred in broad daylight, just before 7:30 a.m. on Central Park West near 70th Street.
 Video taken from surveillance cameras shows a man walk toward Moranis, 67, and punch him in the head, knocking him to the ground.

The second-degree murder charges carry a mandatory sentence of life in prison if he's convicted.
 Robertson was a convicted felon when he allegedly fatally shot two Texas women in Baton Rouge in 2015. Brandi Gilbert, of Plano, and Corrine Rayford, of Grapevine, both 23, were shot in the head and found in a parked car on Boone Avenue on June 19, 2015.
 Less than two weeks later on July 1, 2015, Robertson allegedly robbed a Cracker Barrel on Jefferson Highway and tried to rob a Comfort Inn security guard off College Drive in incidents that occurred two hours apart.
 The hotel guard disarmed Robertson in the parking lot, and that pistol was traced back to the double-homicide.
 Even though the 1st Circuit set aside Robertson's 10-2 armed robbery conviction and sent it back to district court for a new trial, the appeals court said a rational juror could have concluded that the perpetrator at the Cracker Barrel and Comfort Suites "was one and the same person, the defendant."
 The appellate court said any juror could have "reasonably concluded" that Robertson, dressed in black and wearing an Atlanta Falcons cap, robbed the convenience store clerk and then tried to rob the hotel security guard.

Por Jaime García, Director del Índice de Progreso Social e Investigador de CLACDS/INCAE En medio del complicado proceso electoral de Estados Unidos, y la división que los números muestran, el principal lema de campaña del presidente Donald Trump, “Make America Great Again” o en español, “Hacer que Estados Unidos vuelva a ser grande” toma una gran relevancia. Al ver el desempeño del país en indicadores sociales y ambientales como los que mide el Índice de Progreso Social saltan a la vista rezagos importantes en temas que no deberían de preocuparle a la economía más grande del mundo, casi un 23.6% de la economía global, en términos de Producto Interno Bruto (PIB). Por ejemplo, en la tasa de mortalidad materna Estados Unidos (EU) ocupa el lugar 73 de 163 países con una tasa de 29.34 fallecimientos por 100,000. Es decir, la probabilidad de que muera una mujer dando a luz en Estados Unidos es mayor que en Chile, Uruguay o Costa Rica, tres países de América Latina con menor tasa de mortalidad materna. En términos de seguridad, y específicamente la tasa de homicidios, EEUU tiene una tasa de 4.96 homicidios por cada 100,000 habitantes ocupando la posición 95 de 163 países. Si se compara con los países del G-7, Canadá tiene una tasa de 1.75, Alemania de 0.94, Italia de 0.56, Japón de 0.26, Francia de 1.19 y Reino Unido de 1.20, EU es el país más inseguro de este grupo de países de ingreso alto. Respecto a temas de salud y bienestar, como la esperanza de vida, EEUU ocupa la posición 41 de 163 países con una esperanza de vida a los 60 años de 23.27 años. Un indicador que lo pone detrás de países como Panamá que tiene una esperanza de vida a los 60 años de 24.72 años o Corea del Sur con 25.12 años. La pandemia ha puesto al bienestar y a la salud en el centro de la discusión, sobre todo cuando se consideran enfermedades relacionadas con un poco saludable estilo de vida, y en este aspecto EEUU ocupa el lugar 54 a nivel mundial en mortalidad prematura por enfermedades no contagiosas (cardiovasculares, diabetes, etc.) con una tasa de 282.19 muertes por 100,000 habitantes. Un desempeño que lo pone lejos de potencias asiáticas como Corea del Sur, Japón o Singapur que tienen las mortalidades más bajas del mundo con 154, 155 y 156 fallecimientos por cada 100,000 habitantes respectivamente. En estos primeros días de Noviembre, Estados Unidos también se retira oficialmente del Acuerdo de Paris, aspecto preocupante para el mundo en general, pues si se revisan las emisiones de CO2, Estados Unidos ocupa el lugar 189 con 6,510 toneladas equivalentes, sólo por delante de China que emite 13,000 toneladas equivalentes de CO2, siendo los dos países con mayores emisiones de CO2 en el mundo. Y en términos de educación, si bien ocupa el primer lugar en el mundo por la cantidad de universidades de alto nivel, cuando se mide el acceso a educación básica de calidad (primaria y secundaria), se encuentra que EU ocupa el lugar 91 de 163 países. Superado por Costa Rica que ocupa el lugar 41 o Suiza que está entre los primeros 10 países del mundo en este indicador. Estos desempeños por supuesto no son resultado de los últimos cuatro años, son una tendencia que hemos podido medir al menos desde hace 10 años; de hecho, Estados Unidos es uno de los tres países del mundo que han retrocedido en progreso social, los otros dos son Hungría y Brasil. Y aunque el motor económico de EEUU ha estado avanzando en estos últimos 10 años a una tasa promedio de 2.5% anual, y tiene un PIB per cápita ajustado por paridad de compra de 62,683 dólares, ubicándolo en el lugar 8 de 163 países, las condiciones sociales y ambientales, la calidad de vida de los estadounidenses no ha mejorado. Y por supuesto, en un país tan extenso en territorio, con una población de 328 millones de habitantes, y con una gran diversidad cultural, las realidades son contrastantes. Los números presentados y ese bajo desempeño de EEUU son reflejo de una desigualdad en bienestar y prosperidad alarmante, por ejemplo, Kentucky y Alabama tienen tasas de mortalidad materna de 40.8 y 36.4 fallecidos por 100,000 respectivamente, en contraste, Illinois tiene una tasa de 9.7 muertes por cada 100,000 de acuerdo con los datos del CDC. Estos contrastes se reproducen en otros indicadores, y se materializan en el malestar de los ciudadanos que no ven reflejado el éxito económico del país en el progreso de sus Estados, ciudades o comunidades. Por eso, independientemente del resultado electoral, los números muestran que Trump tenía razón, Estados Unidos está lejos de la grandeza, al menos cuando de progreso social se trata, y es una tendencia que hemos podido medir desde los últimos 10 años, incluyendo el gobierno de Trump.

The GPS-only Series 3, which came out in 2017, remains the least expensive model in Apple's watch portfolio -- and, in light of its age and humble feature set, also the most dubious value. With the Apple Watch Series SE currently selling for $260, it'd be hard to recommend buying the Series 3, even at its current sale price. (The 42mm version is also $20 off.) But that might change if the rumors of a price drop at Walmart starting Nov. 25 are true: $119 to $149 would be the lowest price ever. Read our Apple Watch Series 3 review.

As I noted yesterday, we’ll know that theatrical moviegoing is “back” not just when movie theaters are fully open and operational, nor even when Hollywood starts releasing their big movies on the regular. No, we’ll know that “movies are back” when I can do a box office report like this and discuss the results, be they good or bad, exclusively in terms of what went right or wrong with the movie itself as opposed to the current madness. While I had hoped that the well-reviewed and higher-profile horror comedy might break out (comparatively) from the post- _Tenet_ pack, that obviously didn’t happen. Blame a new wave of Coronavirus infections and folks understandably not wanting to go to a theater to see a pulpy little B-movie horror comedy that’ll be available on PVOD at the end of the month.

Also, the claim that the two former chief ministers, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah, individually wouldn’t fight any election till August 5 is undone, doesn’t mean anything as the post August 5 arrangement introduced by New Delhi has made any future chief minister (if at all there is any) like a mayor with no powers even on paper. If a former chief minister doesn’t want to become a mayor, it is no big deal. However, the participation of their parties in any post August 5 process directly or indirectly serves the opposite purpose, as the primary aim of all these exercises – panchayat and district development council polls and various other administrative programmes – is only to entrench the changes brought in after August 5. Nevertheless, if these alliance parties think that participation in any such poll process may earn them some space within the system, they are absolutely wrong and will get no strategic advantage at all. They must understand that they are unwanted in the new scheme of things and have exhausted their utility.

AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Bernhard Langer has seen just about everything during his 37 years playing the Masters but Saturday provided a first for someone who has been featuring here since before most of this year's competitors were even born.
 A unique Masters being played largely in silence without spectators means those few people on the Augusta National premises need to be more observant than usual to stay out of the way, without any gallery noise to provide audible cues.
 Twice Masters champion Langer and his playing companions were on the eighth tee when one oblivious volunteer ambled across the fairway barely 100 yards away.
 Never mind that Langer's bright orange slacks could almost be visible from outer space, the man did not so much as glance to his left.
 Without missing a beat, Langer, smacked his drive directly over the man's head, and only then allowed his famed concentration to be interrupted.
 "Good morning," the 63-year-old German yelled with more than a hint of sarcasm in his voice. "Wake up."
 The man, suitably admonished, then broke into a trot for the last few yards of his traverse across the fairway, though his gesture to make amends was too late to make any difference.
 Langer's drive at that hole traveled all of 250 yards, only 70 yards shorter than that of Rory McIlroy, with whom he played.
 OLDEST PLAYER
 Having become the oldest player ever to make the halfway cut at the Masters, Langer managed a respectable one-over-par 73, before speaking about the incident at the eighth.
 "I tee it up, and I can see him coming," Langer said. "He's already 10 yards into the fairway and I'm thinking, 'Well, should I stop now?' I just figure, what the heck, I'll just hit it over the top of him.
 "He wasn't in danger, but he was clearly in my view, let's put it that way. You don't see that very often that people are walking somewhere across the fairway."
 Later, a 60-foot putt at the par-three 16th that dived into the cup for an unlikely birdie prompted Langer to burst out laughing at the improbability of it all.
 "It was going like a train," he said. "I got a mini-cheer from the 12-and-half people walking with us."
 Just being around for the weekend is improbable enough for the 1985 and 1993 champion, who even in his heyday was not a particularly long hitter.
 "I don't think the course has ever played this long," Langer said, referring to the lack of roll in the fairways due to the rain earlier in the week.
 "It was really wet, and I don't remember hitting three-woods into so many par- fours." (Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris)

Remember how I was saying I needed a hobby? No? Well anyway, I've become a sea swimmer. Almost. I've gone twice since October, which is a pretty big deal as I don't think I went even once all summer. I'll admit to being a bit impressionable so of course now I want to invest in all the gear to look the part. I have a bit of form in this regard so I need to show restraint. When I first started the piano, I used to come home from school at weekends and in a very obvious way, play on my lap while giving sad eyes to my dad. I never made Carnegie Hall. In fact I quit a few weeks after the piano arrived and it became one of those 'things' we decided not to speak about. I might just start with the  gloves, though, as it's kind of tricky trying to swim while holding your frozen hands out of the sea. I'll hold off on the insulated booties just yet as I'm still traumatised by those white veruca socks our mum made us wear in pools when we were kids. As if the puppy fat wasn't bad enough.

By the entrance of Seabrook Apple Market, a couple cars are parked full of foods and groceries in their trunks. One car has its trunk open, with a grocery cart right next to it.
   
 As people stream out of the store, they don't go to their own cars to load the groceries. Instead, they stop first by those cars to donate portions of whatever they just bought.
   
 "Our pantries are very bare at this point," Ronald McDonald House manager Holly Broxterman said. "It is filling that need and it is really the one big drive for us this year that supplies those meals the whole year for those families at the Ronald McDonald House."
   
 The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Northeast Kansas began its food pantry drive Saturday, and will be back at Seabrook Apple Market for a drive-thru collection again next Saturday when the drive ends.
   
 In between the Saturdays, those wanting to donate can stop by inside the market to do so, and the food will be picked up Nov. 21.
   
 Donated groceries will allow the charity to make meals for families staying at their Ronald McDonald House. There are, for instance, parents of children born prematurely who need a place to stay while the child stays at the hospital.
   
 As of Saturday afternoon, the charity had about three to four carloads of groceries and food. In past years, the drive has done very well, and Broxterman is hoping the coronavirus won't put a dent on it.
   
 "I'm overwhelmed by the support so far," she said. "Anything really does count at this point for us."
   
 One person who came to donate was Amy Schell, 42, whose family owns North Star Steakhouse. She was accompanied by her 10-year-old daughter, Emma.
   
 The two had been running grocery errands, but decided along the way to also buy some for the pantry. Schell said when she was younger, her father lost her job, and her family that time had to rely on food banks.
   
 So she wanted to return the favor.
   
 "At this time of year, I know food banks get low because there's a lot of the need with the weather, and it being the holiday season, I feel it's important we do what we can," said the mother.
   
 Seabrook Apple Market is also playing a role by hosting the drive and making space for it. Additionally, the market is matching the first $500 spent on pantry items at its store by donating an equal amount in gift cards.
   
 "It's for a good cause; it helps everybody. It's a local store, we want to keep it local and help the local people," store manager Terry Fleer said.

The Carolina Panthers may be playing at home on Sunday, but the experts are forecasting a 4.5-point defeat. Carolina and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will face off in an NFC South battle at 1 p.m. ET at Bank of America Stadium. The Panthers are limping into the matchup on a four-game losing streak. Carolina might have drawn first blood against the Kansas City Chiefs this past Sunday, but it was Kansas City who got the last laugh. It was a hard-fought game, but Carolina had to settle for a 33-31 loss against Kansas City. The defeat was just more heartbreak for Carolina, who fell 20-17 when the teams previously met in November of 2016. Despite the loss, they had strong showings from RB Christian McCaffrey, who punched in one rushing touchdown in addition to catching ten passes for one TD and 82 yards, and QB Teddy Bridgewater, who passed for two TDs and 310 yards on 49 attempts in addition to punching in one rushing touchdown. Bridgewater ended up with a passer rating of 140.10. Meanwhile, Tampa Bay entered their contest against the New Orleans Saints this past Sunday without any home losses — but there’s a first time for everything. It’s hard to picture a worse loss than the 38-3 bruising that Tampa Bay suffered. They were down 31 to nothing at the end of the third quarter, which was just too much to recover from. One thing working slightly against Tampa Bay was the run-of-the-mill game of their most targeted running back, RB Ronald Jones, who rushed for nine yards on three carries. The losses put Carolina at 3-6 and the Buccaneers at a reciprocal 6-3. A couple defensive numbers to keep in mind before kickoff: The Panthers are stumbling into the matchup with the fifth most rushing touchdowns allowed in the NFL, having given up 12 on the season. To make matters even worse for Carolina, Tampa Bay enters the matchup with only 77.9 rushing yards allowed per game on average, which is the best in the league.

For something non-traditional and a lot more rustic, this Alpine-Style Vickerman Tree will turn heads.
 Skipping the classic, dense triangle shape of groomed Christmas trees, this one gets its inspiration directly from pine trees growing in the wilderness, brought down to a scale that can fit in your living room.
 The real wood trunk is a huge upgrade from the metal poles you're used to trying to hide. The branches are sparse and flat like you'd see in the forest, and they're pre-lit so you're good to go. This six-foot tree is 34 inches across at its widest, but most of the tree is much skinnier than that. This is a perfect tree for a cozy cabin or rustic aesthetic.

Nov. 9 seems to be a day for sour grapes.
 First, the president fired the secretary of defense in a fit of pique. Then Sen. Mitch McConnell decided it was a good idea to let the world know he is not ready for a new administration.
 While President Trump has been beaten, not only is he unwilling to accept the outcome, neither is McConnell. McConnell could have kept his mouth shut and refrained from making himself look like an obsequious sycophant. But instead he chose to step up and stir the pot for no reason apparent to me, declaring the election not over and supporting all the remedies available to Mr. Trump.
 This doesn’t auger well for a future working relationship between the upcoming Biden administration and a Republican-controlled Senate led by McConnell. The best thing that can happen for this country is a clean slate.

Another problem here is that Netflix hasn't made the best decisions in the recent past, so their decision-making capability is bound to be brought into this case as well since if anyone is wondering just what I'm talking about, think of how Netflix stood up for the movie Cuties when it started to enrage a good portion of their subscribers. There was no need to call for cancel culture to step in and rid the streaming giant of the movie, but it was controversial to the point that it simply felt like it came out at the wrong time, and could have been held onto for a while, or possibly edited in a manner that might have made it a bit more acceptable. The point here is that Netflix doesn't have a perfect track record of being careful with their content, which could work in Esparza's favor if he's completely on the level. There are so many legal matters to deal with in the movies and TV that it's difficult to see how anything ever gets done and how anyone could possibly keep it all straight. That's not letting Abraham off the hook, not even close, but it does make a person wonder just how anyone could possibly remember every little thing when it comes to who they have a deal with and how the deal is structured. This is usually why documentation of said agreements is absolutely vital, and why 'forgetting' is not a good idea.
