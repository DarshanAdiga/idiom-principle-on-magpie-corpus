"Trentamila circa sono andati ad un funzionario, che io non ho mai visto, non ho conosciuto, se ne occupava lui dell'Aia" ha piu volte ribadito Nicastri ai magistrati. Stralci di confessione che concordano con quanto lo stesso Causarano diceva a Nicastri " ... quello dell'Aia per fare questo vuole... e uno sicuro... e uno che sa il fatto suo, uno che se dice si, l'operazione si puo fare " . E dalla ricostruzione dei magistrati della Dda emerge come Asciutto in un primo momento abbia dato parere favorevole, ma senza avviare l'iter dell'Aia, l'autorizzazione integrata necessaria per progetti di quella dimensione. Un parere favorevole "semplice" che venne bloccato in autotutela dallo stesso assessorato regionale all'Energia, che si accorse della necessita di utilizzare lo strumento dell'Aia.

  In fact, there’s even a bit of mystery in the form of the show's narrator Lady Whistledown, voiced by the incomparable Julie Andrews. This cheeky voiceover and in-series gossip columnist is the Regency era answer to Gossip Girl and the finger of suspicion will easily fall on different cast members as viewers get their own fan theories on who is passing judgement.


  Bridgerton also embraces its diverse cast of actors and in a manner that recognises its own diversity too, which feels so refreshing for a costume drama of this ilk.

"Ma lei non guadagna lo stipendio?... Mi scusi, lei guadagna uno stipendio, a lei la pagano anche per fare questo... " diceva in tono ironico il funzionario regionale Giacomo Causarano al collega Marcello Asciutto, arrestato ieri per aver preso una mazzetta da 30 mila euro da Vito Nicastri, l'imprenditore considerato il re dell'eolico, al centro dell'indagine sulla corruzione nell'assessorato regionale all'Energia. E Asciutto rideva a crepa pelle con il collega (gia arrestato, processato e condannato a tre anni e quattro mesi per corruzione nell'ambito della stessa indagine) ben sapendo che Causarano non si riferiva al bonifico che la Regione Siciliana ogni mese gli corrisponde, ma ai soldi intascati (30 mila euro secondo gli inquirenti) per favorire i pareri ambientali su due impianti di energie rinnovabili ( biometano) a Francofonte nel siracusano e a Calatafimi nel trapanese. Una battuta e una risata intercettate dalla Dia di Trapani e che per mesi sono rimaste nel limbo, senza un preciso riferimento a condotte illecite. Fino a quando Nicastri, che ha gia patteggiato una pena di due anni e dieci mesi, non si e deciso di raccontare al procuratore aggiunto della Dda Paolo Guido e al sostituto Gianluca De Leo chi erano i referenti all'interno dell'assessorato regionale all'Energia, chi erano i funzionari a cui bisognava "ungere le ruote" per accelerare le autorizzazioni.
