Neither Russell nor Griffithe could be reached for comment. An attorney who is reportedly representing Robert Russell, did not respond to an interview request.
 “Griffithe and Russell exploited popular interest in the cannabis industry to obtain millions of dollars from investors who thought they were buying into a profitable business,” said Melissa R. Hodgman, associate director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division, in a statement.
 Federal officials say the case is symptomatic of the gold-rush mentality of cannabis sales. in Washington, where a recreational marijuana market opened in 2014. It also underscores the challenges of an industry where high startup costs and scarce bank financing might tempt operators to seek investment outside state-approved channels, The Seattle Times  reported  Sunday.
 State records show violations of the of the state’s cannabis investment laws climbed from 11 in 2016 to 49 in 2019.

Morehead’s Quanea Rodgers scored on a shot in the post to give her team the lead, but McMichael’s Hollie Hawkins drained a 3-pointer to reclaim the lead for the Lady Phoenix in the opening minutes of the second quarter. That seesaw battle would continue, but Morehead would go on a late run to build a two possession advantage heading down the stretch. However, back-to-back put-back scores in the post by Robertson on layups with under a minute to go allowed McMichael to take a 29-27 lead into the locker room at halftime.
 Millner tied it on the first possession of the third quarter and then another score by Thomas put Morehead back on top, but Robertson picked up a loose ball and raced the length of the court and scored right before the buzzer to give the Lady Phoenix a 43-41 lead heading into the fourth period.
 It remained a tight game for the majority of the fourth quarter, but once McMichael got it up to a two possession situation, they made most of their opportunities at the free throw line which allowed the Lady Phoenix to close out the win.
 Millner led the Lady Panthers with 20 points and Thomas added 16.

Nearly a month after Iran launched a rare direct military attack against United States forces in Iraq, an uneasy quiet has settled across the Mideast.
 Watching fighter jets roar off the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman, the top U.S. commander for the region believes he is surrounded by one of the reasons that Iran has dialed back its combat stance, at least for now.
 “You’re here because we don’t want a war with Iran and nothing makes a potential adversary think twice about war than the presence of an aircraft carrier and the strike group that comes with it,” Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie told the nearly 5,000 service members on board the 100,000-ton ship. “So, we achieve deterrence, which is preventing Iran from starting a war.”
 Patrolling through the North Arabian Sea, the Truman was about 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Iran when McKenzie and a small number of staff flew aboard on Saturday. His overnight stay on the ship underscored his belief that the additional ships, aircraft, weapons systems and thousands of troops that the U.S. has poured into the region in recent months deliver a message. It’s one he thinks Iran has received.

BEIJING (AP) -- China's death toll from a new virus rose to 259 on Saturday and a World Health Organization official said other governments need to prepare for"domestic outbreak control" if the disease spreads in their countries.   Beijing criticized Washington's order barring entry to most foreigners who visited China in the past two weeks.   Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced similar measures Saturday, following Japan and Singapore.   South Korea and India flew hundreds of their citizens out of Wuhan, the city at the center of an area where some 50 million people are prevented from leaving in a sweeping anti-virus effort. The evacuees went into a two-week quarantine. Indonesia also sent a plane.   The number of confirmed cases in China rose to 11,791, surpassing the number in the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus' rapid spread in two months prompted the World Health Organization on Thursday to declare it a global emergency.   That declaration "flipped the switch" from a cautious attitude to recommending governments prepare for the possibility the virus might spread, said the WHO representative in Beijing, Gauden Galea. Most cases reported so far have been people who visited China or their family members.   The agency acted out of concern for poorer countries that might not be equipped to respond, said Galea. Such a declaration calls for a coordinated international response and can bring more money and resources.   WHO said it was especially concerned that some cases abroad involved human-to- human transmission.   "Countries need to get ready for possible importation in order to identify cases as early as possible and in order to be ready for a domestic outbreak control, if that happens," Galea told The Associated Press.   On Friday, the United States declared a public health emergency and President Donald Trump signed an order barring entry to foreign nationals who visited China within the last 14 days, which scientists say is the virus' longest incubation period. The restrictions don't apply to immediate family of American citizens and permanent residents.   China criticized the U.S. controls and "unfriendly comments" that Beijing was failing to cooperate.   "Just as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the U.S. rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly not a gesture of goodwill," said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.   WHO Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that despite the emergency declaration, there is "no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade."   Meanwhile, iPhone-maker Apple announced Saturday that it was closing all of its 42 stores as well as its corporate offices in mainland China, one of its largest markets, until Feb. 9.   The ruling Communist Party postponed the end of the Lunar New Year holiday in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, for an unspecified "appropriate extent" and appealed to people there to stay home.   Another locked-down city in Hubei, Huanggang, on Saturday banned almost all residents from leaving their homes in the most stringent controls imposed yet. The government said only one person from each household would be allowed out to shop for food once every two days.   "Others are not allowed to go out except for medical treatment, to do epidemic prevention and control work or to work in supermarkets and pharmacies," it said in an announcement.   China's anti-disease controls started with the Jan. 23 suspension of plane, bus and train links to Wuhan, an industrial center of 11 million people. The lockdown has spread to surrounding cities.   The holiday, China's busiest annual travel season, ends Sunday in the rest of the country following a three-day extension to postpone the return to factories and offices by hundreds of millions of workers. The official Xinhua News Agency said people in Hubei who work outside the province also were given an extended holiday.   The party decision "highlighted the importance of prevention and control of the epidemic among travelers," Xinhua said.   Beginning Sunday, the United States will direct flights from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened. Those returning from Hubei province will be subject to a 14-day quarantine.   American Airlines, British Airways, Finnair and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific have canceled or cut back service to mainland China. Vietnam suspended all flights to China. Delta Air Lines said Saturday that it was accelerating plans to suspend its flights between the U.S. and China, with the last flight from China now leaving Sunday.   The U.S. order followed a travel advisory for Americans to consider leaving China. Japan and Germany also advised against nonessential travel to China. Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao.   Countries including Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Turkey all evacuated some citizens from China on Saturday. The Kremlin said Russia would use its air force planes starting Saturday for evacuations.   Germany's defense minister said a plane carrying 128 passengers, most of them German citizens, was refused permission to land and refuel in Moscow due to what the Russians said was lack of capacity. The military transport plane had to divert to Helsinki before it landed in Frankfurt. None of the people aboard was suspected of infection but they all will be quarantined at a military base for two weeks as a precaution, according to the German Foreign Ministry.   At least 24 countries have reported cases since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December.   Australia, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and Vietnam all reported new cases Saturday. Spain confirmed its first case -- a German man who had close contact with an infected person in Germany and then traveled to the Canary Islands with friends. Four friends who were hospitalized with him have not shown symptoms.   Both the new virus and SARS are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that cause the common cold.   The death rate in China is falling, but the number of confirmed cases will keep growing because thousands of specimens from suspected cases have yet to be tested, WHO's Galea said.   "The case fatality ratio is settling out at a much lower level than we were reporting three, now four, weeks ago," he said.   Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with family or other close contact, they are concerned about cases of infection spreading to people who might have less exposure.   ___   Associated Press writers Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi, Tong-hyung Kim in Seoul, South Korea, Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo, Hau Dinh in Hanoi, Vietnam, Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Bharatha Mallawarachi in Colombo, Sri Lanka, contributed to this report.

Moreover, when President Trump takes decisions such as authorising the resumption of International Military Education and Training for Pakistan, or calls Iran a bigger terror threat than Pakistan, he adds to that suspicion. And these are just two small examples. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working overtime to improve India-US relations, and it is during his tenure that breakthroughs have been made in the areas of defence and security, with the signing of some of the foundational agreements. A trade deal is also in the offing. India is an important strategic partner for the US, which the latter recognises. The visit is expected to be a great show of bonhomie and goodwill between the two democracies. President Trump should not spoil the optics and the mood by offering to mediate between India and Pakistan on Kashmir.

Prices fell to $17.30 by the following year, and for producers, it’s been mostly misery ever since. Nationwide, the number of dairy farms dropped from 40,199 in 2017 to 37,468 in 2018. In Wisconsin, a state that takes pride in its image as “America’s Dairyland,” the toll has been particular severe. Though California produces more milk, Wisconsin has more dairy farms than any other state. And more than 1,600 of those have gone under in the past three years.
 But there are reasons to believe the worst might be over, said Jim Ostrom, a partner at Milk Source, the company that owns Rosendale. In November, milk prices in Wisconsin rose to $22.40. Nationwide, they reached $21, finally above the $18 price point that Stephenson cited as a general benchmark for producers turning a profit.
 With dairy prices outside farmers’ control, they have to focus on controlling costs. That’s where technology comes in. A rotary milking parlor can handle 10 cows a minute and can sense when an udder is empty so cows aren’t overmilked, which can harm their health. But a robotic milking system can run more than $200,000.
 “It can be very difficult for a smaller farm to afford this technology because you need, you know, a larger operation to spread those expenses across,” said Liz Binversie, an agriculture educator in Brown County for the University of Wisconsin extension office. She said she knows of one farm that went out of business because it couldn’t find enough workers and could not afford a robotic milking system.
 Wisconsin leads the nation in farm bankruptcies with 45 Chapter 12 filings from July 2018 through June 2019, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. Minnesota was not far behind with 31 during that time.
 Because of debt, the cost of producing milk varies among farms. While some farmers can break even at a price of $18 per hundred pounds, others need $21 because of their debt load.
 Sometimes the way to survive is to join forces with neighbors.
 Hallett shares some advanced machinery with a neighboring farmer, like a combine and planting equipment. And, fortunately, some technology isn’t expensive. Hallett’s cows carry the same microchips as Rosendale uses, so he can know from the comfort of his office the milk weight for each cow and whether a particular cow had less milk that day. The chips cost about 12 cents per month per cow.

The book is clearly written, but can be sentimental. Sometimes, indeed, the author appears to think the whole industrial age has been a mistake. (After the invention of the steam engine, he claims, “humanity lost control of its technology”.) More annoyingly, he has invented a fictional “we” that simply doesn’t exist. From the subtitle (“We Could Have Stopped” it) onwards, he bangs the rhetorical drum that there has been a collective failure of humanity. “We did not… seriously consider the prospect of failure,” he writes. Well, many of us were children at the time, or not yet alive. “Nobody who lives on the electrical grid can be let entirely off the hook,” he insists, though of course if people disconnected en masse from the electricity grid, there would soon be widespread pestilence and death, which is obviously not a preferable outcome. Powering the grid, instead, with more and more renewable sources of energy seems too pedestrian an idea for Rich even to mention.

Combination therapeutics and product innovations and are factors expected to drive the need for easy and non-invasive treatment for patients undergoing psoriasis treatment and thus, will lead to greater product penetration in the psoriasis drugs treatment market. In this regard, the National Psoriasis Foundation reported that in 2016, around 1,200 patients in the U.S. opted for new combinational therapies. The use of psoriasis drugs in combination with other therapies for treating psoriasis is far more effective in the long run. To minimize side effects associated with psoriasis drugs, such as hypertension, swelling, rashes, and inflammatory bowel disease caused by traditional drugs, physicians often suggest the use of combination therapies along with psoriasis drugs. Using the treatment has a positive impact on the patient. This factor is expected to fuel the demand for psoriasis drugs used in combination and consequently boost the growth of the psoriasis drugs market.

Before that, the NFL, well aware of the need to address Kaepernick’s off-the- field concerns, began pumping money into his social-justice cause, to the tune of $25 million so far with more than $60 million additional promised. It teamed with an activist-minded group composed of a few dozen players who called themselves The Players Coalition. That group, however, did not include Kaepernick, who went his own way after a series of contentious meetings with the leaders who ended up as the backbone of the Coalition.

Even otherwise, he is a businessman and business thrives only when there is peace and not war. So it is no surprise that President Trump has taken it upon himself to sort out the Korean problem, although if his efforts have borne any fruit will have to be known soon enough for him to turn it into a talking point in the US Presidential election which will be held in ten months' time. In the meanwhile, if a breakthrough can be made in India-Pakistan relations by bringing the two countries to the discussion table on Kashmir, it is huge optics for the US President in his re-election year. But in this case, President Trump may have bitten off more than he can chew. India-Pakistan relations are not in a shambles because of India's refusal to talk Kashmir with Pakistan. They are in a shambles because of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism that continues to target India in the misguided belief that it will pose an existential threat to a world power such as this country. President Trump may need to attach himself to the coattails of Pakistan's generals to extricate US forces from Afghanistan, but that does not take away from the bitter truth that Pakistan is the fountainhead of global terrorism, and its current Prime Minister, Imran Khan, has admitted as much by saying that at any given time 30,000-40,000 terrorists were roaming on his country's soil.

There are several local resources and strategies available to help forest landowners with these issues and you can learn about them at two identical workshops this winter. The OSU Extension Service is offering “Maintaining a Healthy Forest in an Uncertain Climate” for forest landowners on Feb. 15 in Tiller and March 13th in Roseburg.
 These all-day workshops offer presentations by OSU statewide experts in the climate science, forest pathology/entomology and fire disciplines. OSU Extension and Oregon Department of Forestry will present on market opportunities for forestland owners who are searching for ways to sell or utilize thinned trees of all sizes.
 The afternoon is spent in the field, where participants will learn how to make biochar and tour a small woodland to further the conversation from the morning presentations. All participants will go home with a Risk Assessment and Vulnerabilities form, which will help guide future forest management activities in light of an uncertain climate on any forested property.
 Registration is open for “Maintaining a Healthy Forest in an Uncertain Climate” in both Tiller and Roseburg. For more information and to register, visit the OSU Extension Douglas County Forestry program website at beav.es/ZdF. Registration is open through Feb. 10 for Tiller and March 9 for Roseburg. The cost is $15 per person or $20 per couple (sharing materials).
 These workshops are filling up fast! Register online or visit the OSU Extension Office, 1134 SE Douglas Ave., Roseburg, to register in person. Questions? Call 541-672-4461.

Underlying the bold pronouncements, campaigns and voters acknowledged a palpable sense of unpredictability and anxiety as Democrats begin selecting which candidate to send on to a November face-off with President Donald Trump. The Democratic race is unusually large and jumbled heading into Monday’s caucus. Four candidates were locked in a fight for victory in Iowa; others were in position to pull off surprisingly strong finishes.
 “This is going to go right down to the last second,” said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden’s campaign.
 Polls show Biden in a close race in Iowa with Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang are also competing aggressively in the state.
 Democrats’ deep disdain for Trump has put many in the party on edge about the decision. A series of external forces has also heightened the sense of unpredictability in Iowa, including Trump’s impeachment trial in the Senate, which marooned Warren, Sanders and Klobuchar in Washington for much of the past week.

 The bus rushed Annie Sandifer to to Ascension St. Joseph hospital after the roughly 2:30 a.m. shooting on Milwaukee’s northwest side, but she didn’t survive. Doctors were able to deliver her baby via an emergency cesarean section, police said. The baby was in stable condition, but delivered just 26 weeks into the pregnancy, it was born very premature.
 Police said Sunday that they hadn’t arrested anyone yet, and it wasn’t clear if the bus was the intended target of the attack.

If recent statements of President Trump are examined, post the abrogation of Article 370 and particularly post Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to the United States, it can be said in no uncertain terms that there is a high probability of him stating that he wants to mediate between India and Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and solve what seems to be one of the most complicated geopolitical problems ever.

 The domestic Super Bowl weekend box office has remained under $100 million for the last four years, with last year’s haul totaling a meager $75 million.
 This weekend, Sony’s “Bad Boys for Life” continued its winning streak into a third consecutive weekend, maintaining the top spot and adding $17.7 million for a cumulative $148 million, according to estimates from measurement firm Comscore. The film’s strong showing boosted the total weekend gross to $83.1 million, keeping the year-to-date 10.8% ahead of 2019.

TALLAHASSEE -- On the sixth day of Christmas, Baby Jesus vanished from his manger in a popular nativity scene at a Florida park -- right under the noses of Mary, Joseph and bowing kings.
   
 The disappearance of the replica startled 8-year-old Nate Takacs, who had rushed to get a glimpse of angels and the infant Savior only to find an empty crib at the display at Dorothy B. Oven Park in Tallahassee. The park each year hosts a well-trafficked and colorful Christmas display.
   
 "When I saw the barn and the angels and the kings bowing down, I ran to see what Baby Jesus looks like," Nate recalled Tuesday.
   
 "Why would they take Baby Jesus? It's a big sin," he told The Associated Press.
   
 He rushed back to his parents, who alerted city officials via Twitter.
   
 Might some good Samaritan have taken the baby to protect him from vandals whose holiday spirit was more "bah, humbug" than cheery?
   
 City officials could not immediately say what had happened to the first Baby Jesus. And they couldn't confirm if the disappearance was the result of foul play.
   
 One city employee told the Tallahassee Democrat that some vandals would stick cigarettes into the baby's mouth.
   
 "I was really disturbed that some people might have been vandalizing him," said Nate's mom, Lynne Takacs. "I was shocked by that."
   
 By Tuesday, a different infant was taken out of storage and placed into the manger. The Takacs said they were relieved.
   
 "I'm glad they put another Jesus back," Lynne Takacs said.

Steven Bergwijn's debut goal helped Tottenham to a remarkable 2-0 win over 10-man Manchester City on Sunday to breathe new life into their challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League.
 Jose Mourinho's men had been completely outplayed for the first hour, but were kept in the game by City's profligacy and Hugo Lloris's first-half penalty save from Ilkay Gundogan.
 However, Oleksandr Zinchenko's sending off changed the course of the game as Spurs scored with their first two shots on goal through Bergwijn and Son Heung-min.
 Victory lifts Spurs up to fifth, just four points off fourth-placed Chelsea.
 A sixth league defeat of the season for City sees Liverpool remain 22 points clear at the top and within touching distance of their first league title for 30 years.
 This was arguably the least anticipated of Mourinho and Pep Guardiola's 23 meetings as opposing managers, but it resorted to type as the Portuguese set up Spurs to defend deep, while City monopolised possession.
 The visitors could have been out of sight by half-time as in a recurring theme of their season, the champions were wasteful in front of goal.
 However, Tottenham also felt City were lucky not to be down to 10 men earlier when Raheem Sterling caught England international teammate Dele Alli with his studs.
 Lloris was making just his third appearance since returning from a long-term layoff due to a dislocated elbow, but the French number one was back to his best to keep his side level at half-time.
 Lloris turned Sergio Aguero's low shot onto the post before the Argentine was chopped down in the area by Serge Aurier.
 Referee Mike Dean initially waved play on, but with no break in play for a few minutes he eventually stopped the game after being told to give a penalty by VAR.
 City's dreadful run from the spot continued as Gundogan joined Gabriel Jesus and Sterling in failing to convert in recent weeks as his low effort was parried by Lloris.
 Sterling then pounced on the rebound and went down over Lloris, but no second penalty was awarded and Sterling also escaped the possibility of a second booking for diving.
 The chances continued to come for City as Aguero fired into the side-netting from point-blank range just before the break.
 \- Dream debut -
 Gundogan was the guilty party again minutes into the second period after a calamity of errors.
 Lloris collided with Japhet Tanganga, Aguero's effort was cleared off the line by Toby Alderweireld and when Sterling squared to Gundogan rather than go for goal himself, the German spooned the ball over.
 However, the game was decided in three minutes just after the hour mark.
 Zinchenko was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Harry Winks as Tottenham launched a counter-attack.
 At that point City had had 14 shots on goal to Tottenham's none, but they only needed one.
 Bergwijn, signed earlier this week from PSV Eindhoven, capped a dream debut as he chested down Lucas Moura's pass and volleyed past Ederson.
 Eight minutes later, Spurs were out of sight when Son, who scored three times in a famous Champions League quarter-final win over City last season, was the scourge of City again with a fine low finish from Tanguy Ndombele's pass.
 City's failings at both ends of the field leaves Guardiola with plenty of problems to solve just weeks away from his side's Champions League last-16 clash with Real Madrid.
 And there was more concern for Guardiola ahead of that tie as Sterling hobbled off with a muscle injury five minutes from time.

Captain Charles Ollivon scored two tries as France kicked off a new era under recently-appointed coach Fabien Galthie with a thrilling 24-17 victory over England in their opening 2020 Six Nations match on Sunday.
 Galthie took over full-time in the wake of France's quarter-final exit at last season's World Cup in Japan and looks to have thoroughly revived the France XV, featuring just one player over the age of 30.
 Two first-half tries by Vincent Rattez and Ollivon, along with two conversions and a penalty from Romain Ntamack handed the home side, powered magnificently around the pitch by scrum-half Antoine Dupont, a 17-0 half-time lead.
 A second converted Ollivon try extended France's lead but World Cup runners-up England hit back with a Jonny May brace of tries both converted by Owen Farrell.
 "It's a victory for all the little details put in place and worked on by the coaching staff over the last couple of months," said Galthie. "We were not afraid of making mistakes but were utterly convinced we could win."
 Farrell acknowledged that France had been the "more aggressive from the word go", also dismissing "mental fatigue" as a factor behind the defeat.
 "They scored tries off a couple of our mistakes, we had the ball in our own half too much, we made too many mistakes and they capitalised," Farrell told the BBC.
 "They got a foothold, we kind of paused, we had a bit more in the second half but that's not the way we want to defend."
 \- Buzzing atmosphere -
 There was a buzz around Stade de France not felt for some time and the expectant crowd were soon rewarded after a ferocious start as the two sides piled into each other.
 Livewire winger Teddy Thomas darted in-field, only to be brought down by George Furbank, making his England debut at full-back.
 The ball was quickly recycled and an inside Ntamack pass found Rattez, the late replacement for the injured Damian Penaud easily riding Ben Youngs' tackle to score a fine team try.
 Ntamack converted, hit a 16th minute penalty and then another conversion as new skipper Ollivon showed a clean pair of heels to make the line for France's second try after Courtney Lawes failed to gather a Dupont box kick, Rattez playing provider on the tapdown.
 England were guilty of a raft of basic handling errors, losing possession four times alone when threatening in the French 22m area.
 Farrell spilled the ball in midfield and George Ford's kicking was consistently too long, allowing an easy bedding-in for France's debutant full- back Anthony Bouthier, who produced one stunning 90-metre kick out of hand.
 France's hard-hitting South African-born lock pairing of Paul Willemse and Bernard Le Roux, and centre Gael Fickou were at the heart of a smothering French defence, now masterminded by Shaun Edwards, the rugby league legend who was right-hand man to Warren Gatland during his successful 12-year tenure of Wales.
 Almost a year to the day that France squandered a 16-0 half-time lead over Wales in their 2019 Six Nations opener (eventually losing 24-19), there were nerves about how Les Bleus would weather a loaded English riposte in the second period.
 \- Lick their wounds -
 England won two penalties deep in French territory, twice opting for a scrum. That backfired as Maro Itoje knocked on, the crowd breaking into a booming rendition of La Marseillaise as the French rumbled out of their own half.
 Ollivon crossed for his second try, and France's third, in the 55th minute, showing an openside's fine reading of the game to track Dupont's sharp break and taking an inside pass to glide over.
 Ntamack made no mistake with the extras, but England hit back straight away, winger May chasing down his own chip for a try, Farrell converting.
 Drama was guaranteed to the end as May scored a second try, this time a brilliant individual effort that saw him skip past Rattez, cut back in past Ntamack and around Thomas to the line.
 Farrell converted and with the English set-piece suddenly in the ascendancy, there was all to play for at 24-14.
 But the French held firm for a fine win, Farrell hitting an injury-time penalty for a losing bonus point, and can now look forward to next week hosting Italy, beaten 42-0 by defending champions Wales on Saturday.
 England, however, will have little time to lick their wounds, with a tight six-day turnaround before going to Edinburgh to take on Scotland, defeated 19-12 by Ireland in their opener.

That same gender dynamic plays out among the adults here. With the exception of the batting coach and his wife, who genuinely love each other, there are few happy relationships in “The Cactus League.” The men are unreliable, egocentric and prone to addiction, the women nakedly motivated by greed and vanity. Yet Nemens makes us care about even the worst of them, a neat trick of unsentimental empathy and a testament to the power of careful, almost loving, observation.
 A semi-omniscient narrator, an unnamed down-on-his-luck sportswriter, introduces each chapter, stitching together the events of the season alongside a broader view of the region’s history. He invites us to consider that the earth under which the Lions now play “was once a sea, shallow and warm and dotted with coral reefs,” where “sharks swam through the dugouts, finning to the mound and back.” It’s a conceit that doesn’t always work — especially when comparing the land’s first people to a team that once flourished and then lost big — but at times there’s a gritty charm to the sportswriter’s voice, as when he recalls the early years covering Goodyear: “I watched him grow into his stride like a big-footed puppy, grow into his swing like the lumberjack he’s now known to be. And it was a joy.”

James Hynes, Tommy Clarke's free and Seán Hickey fired London into a three- point lead before Pádraig de Brún opened the home account.
 Goalkeeper Donal O'Sullivan came up to equalise off a free and a '45' and Jamie Lee's free coming up to the break put Limerick 0-4 to 0-3 ahead.
 They were all square when London goalie Noel Maher sent over his '45' on the restart before Lee's free, Séamus O'Carroll and Danny Neville had Limerick on control.
 However, Liam Gavaghan replied with a free for the visitors and moments later Hickey had a shot which screamed wide of the post.
 The sides traded score before Kevin Rafferty again narrowed the gap to one but London couldn't source an equaliser.

OPELOUSAS, La. (AP) " Louisiana is consistently ranked among the most bullied states in America, which research has linked to teenage suicides. So a grassroots effort by volunteers is offering a new way for students to report bullying and perhaps change the tide.
 Shauna Sias, 44, of Opelousas started a movement in October after she heard of yet another teen suicide. She saw on TV that a 13-year-old boy in Baton Rouge had killed himself after being bullied.
 Had anyone seen him bullied? Did anyone say something? Would they have reported it if it was as easy as discreetly dropping a note in a box at school?
 It was this thought process that led Sias to start #Bullybox. She shared her idea on Facebook and received a lot of support, including an invitation to put a box at her alma mater, Opelousas High.
 She made it happen, buying a metal box and decorating it herself.
 Since then the project has grown, with boxes in 16 middle and high schools across St. Landry Parish, plus a Bullybox Club of 15 students.
 As the movement has grown, so has her group of volunteers. Sias and her executive team make and put boxes in schools, give talks, lead monthly club meetings, and take students to community events like school board meetings and Martin Luther King Jr. Day youth celebrations.
 Reciting the old adage, she said it takes a village to raise children, and her team wants to be that village.
 "Our mission is to give the voice back to the children suffering in silence," Sias said. 'We're the village.'
 HOW THE BOXES WORK
 Sias and her team provide the box and a template for the report slips. School staff print the slips and decide where to place the box, usually in a low- traffic area that students pass " the school office but not in a hallway, for example.
 Students can write down any bullying they saw, overheard or experienced themselves. They can include names or not. They also can reach out to Sias directly by email.
 "Most submissions are in my inbox," she said, adding that she didn't want this to be one more thing on a teacher's plate.
 Ideally, though, a report placed in the box would include a name, date and occurrence. Then the school can investigate and address it, Sias said.
 If an incident is reported without names, administrators can still address the topic or Sias is available to speak at the school about it.
 She thinks that just having a Bullybox on campus can make people think twice about bullying or give someone hope.
 "Presence seems to have a lot of deterrence," Sias said. "The fact that it's there is a symbol."
 A Bullybox is not intended to replace what administrators and school districts already do to address bullying, but to supplement it. It's another way for students to report incidents or ask for help.
 BUILDING A VILLAGE
 This movement isn't just about the boxes. It's about spreading a message to stop bullying.
 "Bullybox is more than an idea," Sias said. "It's an opportunity for children to be better than the day before."
 That's where the Bullybox Club comes in. It focuses on enrichment, empowerment, building self-esteem and life skills, she said.
 "Our goal is to build a child up so high it doesn't matter what somebody tells them," Sias said. "You cannot have a productive life if your mental health is not adequate. Mental health starts young."
 Each month they talk about underlying issues of bullying, like poverty and low self-esteem, as well as practical topics like hygiene and etiquette. The goal is to help them become contributing members of their community " their "village," Sias said.
 Previous meetings were open to parents, but now it's just for students so they can speak freely, she said.
 "I remember being a teenager. I know what it feels like to be talked about, to be teased, to feel inferior," Sias said.
 The Bullybox movement also includes community events, like a rally against bullying hosted in Opelousas Nov. 23. Sias said it attracted about 200 people.
 Then there are the Village Awards coming up Feb. 29 at the Exclusive Events Center in Sunset. She hopes to award two college stipends.
 "Not many children are able to attend certain things and don't feel like they belong," she said. "We try to provide something to do every other weekend, encouraging positive social interaction with peers and enriching them as a person."
 The events are free to kids. She said costs are covered by her team or through support from the community.
 'WE CAN'T LOSE ANYMORE'
 Sias, a nurse by trade, wants to prevent more stories of teen suicide like the one that prompted her to start Bullybox.
 "I've held hands when people die. I want to see someone live," she said.
 About 17% of Louisiana respondents to the most recent national High School Youth Risk Behavior Survey said they had committed suicide, with a slightly higher percentage (17.8%) "seriously considered" it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents, behind only accidents (unintentional injuries), according to the CDC.
 "We can't lose anymore," Sias said. "We have to get, if not everyone, at least one."
 Sias has her own stories of bullying to share, going as far back as sixth grade. She was called Buffy at a time when people were naming their dogs Buffy. Someone placed dog food in a bowl on her desk.
 "I'm 44 and I still can remember the color of dog food," she said. "That sits with you."
 'I know the impact and power of peers and friends. If it wasn't for my village, I'd be one of those suicide statistics. I wouldn't be here either.'

Les Bleus stormed 24-0 ahead when captain Charles Ollivon ran in the second of his two tries in the 55th minute and that was the cue for May to conjure a pair of devastating solo tries.
 For the second he beat five defenders while plotting a diagonal line to the posts in a score made possible by his extraordinary pace.
 May's brilliance provided temporary inspiration but England lacked the firepower to make further inroads into the deficit in an improved final quarter they controlled and that finished with Owen Farrell landing a penalty to claim the bonus point.
 A rain-swept Stade de France noisily greeted the new era launched by their head coach Fabien Galthie and the influence of his assistant Shaun Edwards was stamped all over the defensive heroics.
 England, meanwhile, will lick their wounds as they come to terms with the possibility their World Cup final rout by South Africa last autumn may have left deeper scars than initially expected.
