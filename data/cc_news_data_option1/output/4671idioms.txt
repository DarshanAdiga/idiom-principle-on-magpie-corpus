AUGUSTA — Cameron Smith had no idea he was on the verge of Masters history.
 He was too busy undertaking the impossible task of tracking down Dustin Johnson at Augusta National Golf Club, so he wasn't thinking much about his score as he saved pars on the 17th and 18th holes.
 But with that tap-in on 18, Smith accomplished something no one had ever done at a Masters Tournament – post four rounds in the 60s.
 "That's really cool. I had no idea starting today that I needed to do that. Yeah, that's really cool," said Smith after his fourth career Masters appearance. "I mean, I honestly can't believe it, but just got to put it down – myself, just got to put it down to just scrambling and digging deep. There was a few times throughout the week where I could have let it slip away, and it didn't."
 Smith finished the week 67-68-69-69 for a 15-under total, sharing second place with Sungjae Im. That score, a new low for a runner-up at Augusta National, would've been good enough for an outright win at 76 of the 84 editions of the Masters, and it would have tied Patrick Reed in 2018.
 Smith was within two of Johnson as he made the turn Sunday, but Johnson's three consecutive birdies late meant Smith just couldn't catch him.
 "I felt as though I needed to shoot 3 or 4 under on that back nine with the wind the way it was. It got pretty tricky out there," he said. "I would say after 16, after not birdieing 16, I thought if I birdied the last four I thought I would still have a chance. At least make him think about it. And it wasn't meant to be."
 The 27-year-old from Australia, the 45th-ranked player in the world coming into the week, won the Sony Open in January and is a two-time winner of the Australian PGA Championship. He went 1-1-1 for the International Team during the 2019 Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne Golf Club, winning his singles match against Justin Thomas.
 He tried to play his way into the Masters at the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship, playing in the final group in 2011 as Hideki Matsuyama won it for a second time to earn an invitation to Augusta. He remembers watching from the gym at the Queensland Academy of Sports in 2013 for countryman Adam Scott's Masters victory.
 He said this week's finish is a massive confidence booster that he'll carry back to Hawai'i as he tries to defend his Sony Open title. He felt that he struggled with the driver at times this week but said his scrambling was the best it's ever been.
 He set up birdies on 7 and 9 with shots hit through tight windows after finding trouble off the tee, and he got up and down for birdie on 15 from left of the Sarazen Bridge.
 "Yeah, obviously had an option of chipping out," he said of his save on 7. "Knew I had to keep the pressure on Dustin, and wasn't here to finish second, basically. There was a small gap up there. Just had to hit it really hard and good, and it turned out well."
 This is the best finish at the Masters for Smith, who surged into a tie for fifth in 2018 with a final-round 66.

"I had reached out to Cody. I think everybody in the world was reaching out to Cody at the time," Hager pointed out. "We knew that we were on the same page; maybe it can work out. I reached out again and I'm still not getting anything. This is about May. This is _Double or Nothing_ time and I'm not getting anything, and I think I told you that, and so, [Jericho] reached out. And he was like, 'hey, check back in a couple weeks,' and I don't know what changed but then you came back an hour later. You're like, 'no man, this is it. They want to go with you.'"
 Jericho added that the formation of The Inner Circle might have changed Khan's mind. He has spoken before on pitching Hager as his muscle for his faction, and he spoke on "subtly nudging" Khan into signing Hager.
 "I think what changed was that The Inner Circle became a thing," Jericho said. "That must have been something because I remember it took him a long time. We're talking about Tony Khan - it took him a long time to get back to you, and I kept kind of subtly nudging him. And he was like, 'yeah, yeah, sure, sure', but something switched and maybe that was it. Maybe he decided you were the right man for the job."
 Hager spoke highly of Khan, noting how easy he is to talk to. He also talked about how everyone in The Inner Circle gelled together quickly.
 "You set us up, and I know we had a great phone call with him," Hager recalled. "And I got off the phone, and I was like, 'holy cow, this is a billionaire. This is the owner of the company? He was so casual and easy to talk to that you could really feel comfortable telling him, 'hey, man, I'm really insecure about whatever.' It was one of those types of conversations, and hopefully-- I like to say my winning personality along with the endorsement for The Inner Circle helped.
 "It was so cool how it happened, and immediately, everybody just kind of started getting to know each other and really vibe. Of course, I feel like you do a great job of seeing the bigger picture. 'That's all great. Let's do it this way and make it even better.'"
 Hager reflected on his first year at AEW and called it the greatest year of his pro wrestling career. He talked about how it was established early on that his AEW character would be different than his WWE character, with Jericho cutting fans off who chanted "We The People".
 "I look back at this year with AEW as the greatest year in my career pro wrestling wise. Moments like that were really cool," Hager expressed. "14,000 people, the debut episod - I was nervous as s--t and I had the easiest thing to do. All I had to do was run out to the ring without tripping and then slide in the ring and do a couple things. You look back at some of the uncut footage that they have formatted, it's so cool, and the crowd was going so crazy.
 "I think you had to know that we were onto something that night, because we talked about 'We The People'. They are all started chanting 'We The People.' The first night they were chanting it and then the second night is when you completely cut it off, and they haven't said it since. It's just cool because we are different characters with AEW, so let's be different."
 Jericho added that while he is appreciative of fans that still chant "Y2J", he admitted that it pisses him off because fans are chanting for a character that is over 20 years old. He noted that it is also diminishing AEW because they are more focused on something WWE related rather than the AEW product.
 "That's what I wanted people to understand, because once in a while, they still want to chant 'Y2J,' and I understand you're being appreciative but it's pissing me off because that's a character that's 20 years old," Jericho pointed out. "And also, if you're an AEW fan, it's kind of demeaning to our product if you're saying something that was made famous in WWE, and that's why with the 'We The People thing,' I'm like, I want this shut off now.
 "I don't want them seeing Jack Swagger. I want them to see this brand new guy, which now, a year in, Jack Swagger's a memory, as is Dean Ambrose, as is a lot of those types of characters, but Jake Hagar's the guy. So that's what we need to make people realize and remember. This is a whole new dude here."

Ben Roethlisberger spent the week stuck at home, equal parts pre-Kindergarten teacher to his young children and overzealous student to the Pittsburgh Steelers’ coaching staff after being forced to prepare remotely because of the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols.
 It wasn’t exactly fun. Yet it may have been also a blessing in disguise. No practice meant no throwing. No throwing meant the 38-year-old’s surgically repaired right arm could rest, not necessarily a bad thing in mid-November. Rest meant the juice Roethlisberger has occasionally struggled to muster during Pittsburgh’s record-setting start could return.
 Considering the results, maybe Roethlisberger should take it easy more often, protocols or no protocols. The veteran passed for a season-high 344 yards and four touchdowns on Sunday as the Steelers improved to 9-0 with a 36-10 blowout of Cincinnati.
 “I’m trying to talk coach into seeing if I can take next week off, too,” Roethlisberger said with a laugh after Pittsburgh beat its division rival for the 11th straight time.

Carried by the defense for much of the game, the Bills were simply gassed at points late in the contest, having been tasked with trying to contain Murray for 60 minutes. They were far more successful than some thought they'd be but, in the end, the Buffalo offense made the task much more daunting with giveaways.

The Supreme Court of India deserves gratitude from those who believe in the values of freedom and democracy. That “jail is the exception and bail is the rule” has been repeated endless times, yet it appears to many in India that jail is the norm and bail the exception. The emphasis by the Apex Court on liberty in the recent granting of bail to some media personalities will hopefully be emulated by courts across the country. So far as the media is concerned, over the years dozens of journalists have been sent to jail in states across the country. Some have been silenced in a more permanent way. In another field, numerous personnel connected to India’s nuclear and missile industries succumbed to “suicides”, “accidents” and “break-in murders” since the 1990s, when President Bill Clinton declared a public as well as a covert war on both nuclear and missile activity in our country. The killings stopped once reports of the serial deaths of individuals in the nuclear and missile industry appeared in The Sunday Guardian. The time has been overdue to investigate the arrest, intimidation and deaths of numerous Right to Information (RTI) activists across the country who seek to probe wrongdoing by those in authority. RTI was intended to be an instrument of transparency that would tear away the layers of secrecy in which governmental processes operate. Instead, the UPA regime ensured that RTI boards were dominated by those who had spent their entire careers keeping information away from the public. This is among the practices of the past that should not be allowed to continue . A country's progress is determined by those in key positions. Care needs to be taken to ensure that attendance in the durbars of powerful bureaucrats and politicians cease to be indispensable for getting into positions of authority. On paper, there are “360-degree investigations” of prospective nominees to responsible office. In reality, such consultations usually take place solely within a narrow band of officials and their favourites. The personnel dossiers that get prepared about suggested nominees often reflect the personal and other biases of those preparing them rather than be a factual rendition of an individual’s pluses and minuses.

The cases emerged while election workers continued counting thousands of ballots. As a hand tally of the presidential race began in Georgia, the state’s top election official placed himself under quarantine after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus.
 In Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is in a county considered a national virus hot spot, an election official who worked an early voting site later tested positive.
 “I’m actually surprised that we don’t have more cases,” said Linn County Election Commissioner Joel Miller, who noted that several county workers in his building tested positive in the last week. “It actually seems kind of far- fetched that we didn’t have more, but they might not be reporting it to us.”
 Election workers in Jackson County, Missouri, in the Kansas City suburbs, seem to be the hardest hit so far, with about 28 staffers testing positive in the past couple of weeks.
 Tammy Brown, head of the Jackson County Election Board, said her staffers urged voters who felt ill to avoid coming inside, though she suspects not everyone listened. The board dealt with nearly 200,000 voters, including more than 60,000 who cast early ballots.
 “We, as election officials, all knew we were at risk,” Brown said. “I don’t think this was shocking to any of us.”
 With transmission rates high in Missouri, health officials are not ready to link the cases to polling places. They say the workers could have become infected anywhere.
 The county offered drive-thru voting for people with COVID-19 or who were quarantining because of contact with someone who was infected. When part-time workers became ill, full-time election board staff worked the drive-thru line.
 It’s difficult to trace cases back to polling places because the virus manifests in different ways, and some people never get symptoms. Infections also are spiking as people gather with extended family or friends and return to more crowded public settings.

The dent in the finances of the state because of the liquor ban caused a reduction in government programs and job creation. At the same time, instead of becoming weaker, the liquor lobby has been celebrating the onset of Prohibition. They are making extortionate profits from the shortage of alcohol. Prices have risen by more than four times, only this time the extra amount is in black and outside the ambit of Central and State taxes. As a consequence, Central revenues also suffered because of the CM’s moral policing. Certainly alcohol is best avoided, but the way to achieve abstinence is for Nitish Kumar to dress in the simple manner of the Mahatma and go about on foot from village to village preaching the virtues of temperance. Setting the police loose on those who do not share his moral principles and preferences in liquid refreshment is another example of the manner in which laws and regulations in India have been used to try and change even such forms of social behaviour as are non-threatening to others. Had the Chief Minister stiffened the penalties for violence under the influence of alcohol and the creation of a public fracas by the inebriated, the response to the liquor ban would not have been so profound. The best way to reduce the influence of the liquor lobby is to go the Tamil Nadu way and ensure that authorised sales are made at reasonable prices to the poor. Unlike in the case of Bihar, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu does not regard it as part of the duty of the state government to prescribe or proscribe lifestyles, dress or diet.

"I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden administration, but democracy generally. And that's a dangerous path," he said.
 Nearly two weeks after Election Day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted that they are preparing for a second term.
 In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would "not be going to a lockdown" to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that "whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell."
 Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities. Dominion has said it "denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems."
 The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, said in a statement last week that the "November 3rd election was the most secure in American history." The agency said, "There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."
 In his latest fundraising email, Trump told supporters that "we are fighting to ensure EVERY SINGLE LEGAL ballot is counted" and that he had "legal teams on the ground in every critical state."
 John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, said it was important for party leaders to explain to voters that Trump did lose and that his claims of election fraud are baseless. Bolton left the administration last year. He says he resigned; Trump says he fired Bolton.
 "I think as every day goes by, it's clearer and clearer there isn't any evidence. But if the Republican voters are only hearing Donald Trump's misrepresentations, it's not surprising that they believe it," Bolton said on ABC's "This Week." "It's critical for other Republican leaders to stand up and explain what actually happened. Donald Trump lost what by any evidence we have so far was a free and fair election."
 Having none of that was Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney who is helping lead Trump's national legal front on the election challenge. In a television appearance that Trump previewed on Twitter after his morning tweets, Giuliani denied Trump was conceding -- "No, no, no, far from it."
 "I guess,'' Giuliani told Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," "you would call it sarcastic."

While the plan wasn’t to have Roethlisberger throw 46 times, the Bengals didn’t give him much choice. Cincinnati stacked the line trying to stop the run, basically betting Roethlisberger couldn’t find a rhythm given his lack of practice time and the swirling winds.
 They chose poorly. Following a sluggish start, Roethlisberger  got going with a 46-yard rainbow to Johnson late in the first quarter. That set up a 12-yard strike to Johnson that put Pittsburgh up 12-0.
 Burrow’s 2-yard touchdown to Tee Higgins on fourth down drew the Bengals within 12-7, but Cincinnati would get no closer. Roethlisberger responded by leading a 78-yard drive, zipping a fastball to Smith-Schuster to put the Steelers back up by 12.
 Pittsburgh poured it on in the second half despite having little support in the running game. Considering the way Roethlisberger was throwing, it hardly mattered. Touchdown passes of 5 and 11 yards to Claypool blew it open.

AUGUSTA — Dustin Johnson finally has the one he always wanted.
 The boyhood dreams always took place at Augusta National Golf Club, just a little more than an hour away from his Columbia home.
 He'd have a putt to win the Masters – or maybe a chip shot with the tournament on the line. Same with his practice sessions as a junior golfer. Then he'd imagine slipping into the green jacket.
 It still felt like a dream to him Sunday when Tiger Woods helped him into the 42 long he always hoped for, only in real life there was no need for a tournament-clinching putt or chip.
 He was so good all week that no one could catch him.
 Johnson shot a final-round 68 and broke the tournament scoring record previously held by Woods and Jordan Spieth with a 20-under 268 total and a five-shot victory for his second major championship.
 "Well, just growing up so close to here, it's always been a tournament that since I've been on Tour, since I played my first Masters, it's been the tournament I wanted to win the most," said Johnson, who led Dutch Fork High School to a state championship in 2002 and played collegiately at Coastal Carolina. "You know, being close the last couple years, finishing second last year to Tiger, this one was just something that I really wanted to do.
 "Obviously starting today with a four-shot lead, you know, I knew it wasn't going to be easy. I knew I was going to have to play well if I wanted to win. ... But it was still hard. I mean, I was nervous all day, but I felt like I controlled myself very well. Controlled the golf ball very well in difficult conditions. I felt like the wind was really tricky. The course, the greens were a little bit faster. Felt like you really had to be careful around here today."
 Johnson had to be careful, but the rest of the field had to go for broke to try to track him down.
 He didn't worry after a few early mishaps, like a chunked chip on 2 and bogeys at 4 and 5. His 8-iron nestled 7 feet from the cup for a birdie on 6, and that calmed his nerves.
 Johnson got up and down for a key par at 11 and then hit the green at 12 for a critical 3. From there, he birdied 13, 14 and 15 to reach 20 under – which also ties a major championship record – and lock up the tournament.
 After his drive on 17, another cannon blast off the tee, he exhaled deeply. His caddie, brother Austin, asked him on the 18th hole if he knew where he stood.
 "I did not. Not exactly," he said. "I mean, I assumed I had the lead, but I didn't know by how many. I mean, that was kind of my goal. I kind of looked at the leaderboard a little bit early, and after that I just, you know, told myself, 'Don't worry about what anybody's doing. Just play as good as you can.'"
 He could finally crack a smile after tapping in for par and the win, making official what everyone had known for hours – if not days, or even months.
 "Yeah, I thought I'd have a decent shot if I got to Dustin's original score at the start of the day, 16 under," said co-runner-up Cameron Smith, whose 15-under total would have been good enough for an outright win in 76 of the 84 editions of the Masters. "I knew I had to put the pressure on early. Got out of the gates pretty good and DJ was just too good at the end."
 Johnson has been the hottest golfer on the planet since a bizarre stretch in July in which he went 80-80 and missed the cut at the Memorial and then shot 78 and withdrew from the 3M Open.
 Since then? T12, T2, win, runner-up, win, T6, T2, win.
 Those wins include two playoff events, one being the Tour Championship which clinched the FedEx Cup, and now the Masters.
 The 36-year-old has a famously stoic demeanor, but a win at Augusta National was enough to leak tears through that facade.
 "On the golf course, I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions, you know, because I'm out there playing golf. But yeah, I had a tough time speaking with (CBS' Amanda Balionis) on the putting green," he said. "Just because it – like I said, it means so much to me. It means so much to my family, Paulina, the kids. They know it's something that I've always been dreaming about and it's why I work so hard.
 "You know, I put in a lot of work off the golf course, and I think it's just – it's something that you push yourself for. That's why I work so hard, is to be in this position. And you know, to finally have the dream come true, I think that's why you see all that emotion."
 Johnson looked like a lock for the record books early in the tournament, reaching 10 under through 22 bogey-free holes. The field caught up in peak scoring conditions, and early Saturday Johnson was part of a nine-way tie for the lead.
 His bogey-free 65 in the third round separated him from the field, and this time he finally closed out a major after holding the 54-hole lead – he came back from four down for his first major title at the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont.
 Johnson's major championship heartache is well documented. There was the 82 at Pebble Beach in the final round of the 2010 U.S. Open, the waste-area-turned- bunker that kept him out of a playoff later that year at the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits and the three-putt on the 72nd green at Chambers Bay to lose the U.S. Open in 2015.
 He was the favorite coming to Augusta National in 2017 but had to withdraw that Thursday after falling in his rental home and injuring his back. Then last year he was a runner-up to Woods.
 Nineteen months later, it was Woods putting the jacket on Johnson.
 "Obviously having Tiger put it on was awesome and unbelievable and, you know, you couldn't – you wouldn't want it any other way. But any guy could put it on me and I'd be just fine," he joked.
 Smith (69) and Sungjae Im (69) tied for second at 15 under, Justin Thomas (70) was fourth at 12 under, and Rory McIlroy (69) and Dylan Frittelli (72) tied for fifth at 11 under. Woods tied for 38th at 1 under after a final-round 76 that included a 10 at the par-3 12th.
 Abraham Ancer was in the final group with Johnson and finally started to look like a Masters rookie after shooting in the 60s in each of his first three rounds. Ancer knew he couldn't keep up with Johnson off the tee and tried not to watch, and his inexperience showed in a final-round 76 to tie for 13th.
 "I knew it was going to be really hard to beat him because he was definitely four strokes ahead and I knew he was going to make birdies, and I just didn't really play my game, and that's kind of how it happened," he said.
 Johnson tested positive for COVID-19 last month and had to quarantine for 11 days in Las Vegas. It came at a time when he knew it wouldn't keep him out of the Masters, and he made it back to competition and showed he was still in top form.
 He was a co-betting favorite this week, even if he didn't receive the same attention as Bryson DeChambeau. He shared the lead after each of the first two rounds, then over the weekend showed why he's the top-ranked player in the world.
 "Honestly it still feels like a dream," he said. "As a kid, dreaming about winning the Masters, having Tiger put the green jacket on you, it still seems like it's a dream. But I'm here, and what a great feeling it is. I couldn't be more excited."

Chariho did not have enough junior varsity players that were not in close contact with the infected player to continue the season. Godbout and the other coaches on the team were not in close contact with the player and will not have to quarantine, she said.
 It was a tough ending to the season for the Chargers, who posted a 4-2-2 overall record and finished 2-1-2 in Division II-South.
 "We are absolutely heartbroken for the senior class," Godbout said. "This senior crew played with Maddie Potts as freshmen. They've persevered and showed such resilience through everything. They've had such enthusiasm and drive this season."
 Potts died in September 2017 after suffering a brain aneurysm during a game.
 Chariho is the second local team to have its season end early due to the coronavirus.

The largest free trade agreement in history was signed over the weekend, with 15 countries in the Asia Pacific region agreeing to be signatories. In total, the agreement will cover 30% of the world's GDP and population to surpass the Trans-Pacific Partnership in scale.
 The signatories involved are Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, and the 10 members of ASEAN, including Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
 The signatories' leaders agreed to the terms of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) at the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Bangkok last year, with the agreement being officially signed on Sunday. In a joint statement, the signatories said the trade deal would play an important role in plans to recover from the pandemic and help build the region's resilience through an "inclusive and sustainable post- pandemic economic recovery process".
 "In light of the adverse impact of the pandemic on our economies, and our people's livelihood and well-being, the signing of the RCEP Agreement demonstrates our strong commitment to supporting economic recovery, inclusive development, job creation, and strengthening regional supply chains," the signatories said in the joint statement.
 The RCEP will primarily focus on standardising trade rules across countries in a bid to make it easier for people to do business. For example, the RCEP will enforce a new single set of rules for accessing preferential tariffs in any of the 15 RCEP markets.
 RCEP countries will also create a new framework of rules for telecommunications that build on ASEAN's existing free trade agreements that focus on improving access and use of public telecommunications systems and access to essential telecommunications facilities. The new framework will also ensure RCEP countries do not discriminate against each other in providing access to submarine cable systems.
 In terms of cybersecurity, RCEP countries have committed to collaborating and exchanging information on best practices for dealing with cybersecurity incidents and building the capacity of authorities to respond. When drafting the RCEP, signatory countries said they recognised that cooperation with each other was crucial for preventing cybersecurity attacks.

And therefore, the bond market will pretend to look the other way and comply with government's Rs 12 trillion market borrowing, and possibly more in the coming days knowing well that RBI will use its balance sheet to absord the excess flow and still not call it indirect monetisation, say bond dealers. The RBI's logic is also convincing here. Since February 2019, the policy rate has been cut by 250 basis points, with 115 basis points cut in repo coming since the lockdown in end-March. But the bond yields have not fallen as much.

Roethlisberger and three teammates were forced to self-quarantine for five days after tight end Vance McDonald tested positive for COVID-19. While he could sit in on meetings over videoconference and bombard offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner and quarterbacks coach Matt Canada with texts, he missed being around his teammates.
 Still, any concerns about his absence affecting his performance vanished quickly. Roethlisberger found Diontae Johnson and  JuJu Smith-Schuster for touchdowns in the first half at blustery Heinz Field and connected with rookie Chase Claypool twice in the second half — both of them on screaming darts — as the Steelers pulled away for an easy one after three straight victories that came down to the final snap.
 “It was a challenging week. It wasn’t a very fluid week for us,” Tomlin said after his team spent a second straight week in the NFL’s intensive COVID-19 protocols. “We didn’t have a lot of exposure to our guys. A lot of anxiety in terms of prep ... but we’re not letting some of the challenges in the pandemic affect the quality of our play.”
 Not by a long shot. At least not against Cincinnati.
