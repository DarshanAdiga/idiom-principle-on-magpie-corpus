ANSA) - MILANO, 29 AGO - "14 giorni passano veloci…". Su Instagram Flavio Briatore dedica questo messaggio al figlio Falco Nathan in vista dell'isolamento domiciliare che attende l'imprenditore dopo le dimissioni dal San Raffaele dove era ricoverato da domenica, positivo al coronavirus. Il messaggio social di Briatore è accompagnato da una foto scattata in estate assieme al figlio. L'imprenditore, proprietario del Billionaire, resterà a Milano per il periodo di isolamento domiciliare, probabilmente ospite nella residenza di Daniela Santanchè, sua amica e senatrice di FdI, in zona Corso Vercelli. In un primo momento Briatore era intenzionato a trasferirsi subito nella sua casa di Montecarlo ma i medici gli avrebbero consigliato di non allontanarsi dal capoluogo lombardo. "È sotto gli occhi di tutti che ci stanno massacrando, forse io e Flavio Briatore in questo momento siamo molto utili come arma di distrazione di massa con i tanti problemi che ha questa Nazione ma pazienza, le nostre spalle sono grosse", ha detto Daniela Santanchè in un discorso ai clienti del Twiga, il suo locale in Versilia, come si vede nel video pubblicato ieri sera in una storia su Instagram. Nel video l'imprenditrice ha annunciato che tutto il personale del suo locale è risultato "negativo ai tamponi tre giorni fa" e ha invitato tutti i clienti a rispettare le misure anti-Covid "anche se non ci piacciono e le contestiamo". (ANSA).

By design, they are stripped of back stories including Washington’s enigmatic hero. Only Debicki’s emotionally brittle spouse resonates on a satisfying emotional level, although she suffers grievously like many of Nolan’s female characters. The writer-director’s on-screen talisman, Sir Michael Caine, savours a throwaway role as an aristocrat with a trembling finger on the pulse of impending doom. For all the smoke and mirrors, it's possible to remain one step ahead of Nolan’s script, anticipating junctures when characters will glance off each other without fully understanding the implications until much later. Or much earlier. No, both. Pass the paracetamol and popcorn.

Having established the cultural backdrop, let us look at Hollywood. Do you know no black man could get a role as late as 1939? White men had to paint their faces to black, an artform tagged BLACKFACE (what some black Yoruba actors do, not understanding the racist beginnings of that artform) to act as a black man who invariably will be a slave, rapist, thief, etc. _BIRTH OF A NATION_ , a movie that aired ingloriously in the Whitehouse celebrated the Klu Klux Klan and showed the blackman as a savage rapist. That is the history of Hollywood. Even the house girl role given to Hattie McDaniel in _GONE WITH THE WIND_ in 1939 met great resistance. Sidney Poitier and Harry BellaFonte also faced brutal racism and refusal to be cast in decent roles that were not houseboy or slave or villain. Hattie McDaniel, when asked why she did not refuse roles that showed blacks as only maids said "I rather play maid in a movies than be broke and be a maid in real life"

Sometimes, magicians show you how the trick is done, or fool you into believing that’s what you’re seeing.

Ivan, a 400-pound silverback gorilla has been living in a shopping mall for the most part of his life, along with companions Stella, the elephant and Bob, the dog. But, it is not until a baby elephant arrives in the mall that Ivan starts questioning his life under captivity; away from the wild. At the time of writing, little did author Katherine Applegate think that her story of Ivan, would take a visual form as a live-action film titled _The One and Only Ivan_.
 Upon its publication in 2013, the book of the same name, won numerous awards including the Newbery Medal, for its portrayal of the real-life story of a gorilla that lived for almost 27 years in a shopping mall in Tacoma, Washington before being moved to a sanctuary. The heart-warming story now unfolds visually under the direction of Thea Sharrock, replete with a star cast: Sam Rockwell as the voice of Ivan, Angelina Jolie for Stella; Danny DeVito for Bob; Helen Mirren for Snickers the poodle, among others. Jolie writes, “She [Katherine] got into the mind of Ivan, and how humans see him, and what humans expect of animals. He speaks a lot about life, and some of the heavy things that need to be addressed. But expressed through an artistic, playful, loving gorilla, somehow those life lessons come out easier and digested in a different way.”
 Katherine had come across this extraordinary story in the _New York Times_. “When I saw this article, I was struck by how bizarre it was and what a compelling story it made. But, it took me a while to figure out how to fictionalise this story and write from the gorilla’s point of view,” says the author, over a Zoom call.
 When _The One and Only Ivan_ movie was taking shape, Katherine was very much involved in the process; she reviewed the script, adapted for screen by Mike White, as it progressed. “He was very true to the story. I was also able to visit the set in London. It was absolutely fascinating to see this tiny idea in my mind, turn into this huge and beautiful creation. It was wonderful to see these professionals at work,” adds Katherine.
 Is the movie a page-to-page adaptation of her work? “The heart of the story is very much there in the movie as well,” Katherine explains. However, when a story is adapted for screen on a large scale, changes are inevitable, she adds. “Mike has brought in a lot of exciting new elements that lend action; that are necessary while moving to a big screen,” Katherine says, stressing the fact that the novel was originally written for a young audience.
 The star cast has admittedly left her baffled. She laughs when asked about her experience working with them. “It’s the weirdest to have written these characters and hear Angeline Jolie or Bryan Cranston, Danny DeVito or Helen Mirren saying those dialogues. It was surreal for me as a writer,” Katherine says. The writer has just finished working on the sequel to _The Only and Only Ivan_ , called _The Only and Only Bob_ , which dives deeper into the story of Bob.
 Ivan was deprived of the natural world and was not allowed to see other gorillas for 27 years. In a strange way, Katherine says, Ivan’s story reflects on the present day, when human isolation is the norm to fight the pandemic. “In some way, this is what we are all going through and it may hit home in a way that I hadn’t anticipated,” she concludes.

Statements were delivered in person or in prerecorded videos, either by the victims themselves or read on their behalf. Some spoke through translators. Many went off script.Emotions ranged the gamut from disbelief and anger, to defiance and rage, to unbearable grief and even – from a few – forgiveness.While the terrorist Brenton Tarrant showed little emotion, it was impossible for those in court and many more watching the proceedings not to be affected by the words of those suffering as a result of the 29-year-old’s actions.In the end, though, it may have been 15 seconds where no words were spoken at all that proved the most powerful.Osama Adnan Abukwaik, 37, was a Palestinian who grew up in Egypt. He gained a master’s in engineering in Cairo and was working as a project manager, but lost his job when the country’s top communications companies sacked all of their Palestinian and Syrian employees.After two-years, still working as a project manager but on a substantially lower salary, he spent all of his savings to emigrate to New Zealand with his wife and three young children.Mr Abukwaik was one of the approximately 190 worshippers praying at the Al Noor mosque just after 1.30pm on Friday, March 15 last year, when Tarrant entered armed with a semiautomatic shotgun and modified AR-15 rifle to begin his massacre.The loving father was among the 44 killed during the initial rampage. A further seven people were murdered at the nearby Linwood Islamic Centre.“He told his wife he loved New Zealand so much he wanted to live, die and be buried in it,” his older brother, Youssef Abukwaik, 43, told the NZ Herald soon after the attack.“He also wants his children to grow up in (New Zealand), so we will carry out his wish.” Youssef, who lives overseas, did not attend the sentencing in person, instead providing a written statement that was read on his behalf by Chris Davies from New Zealand Police.“I feel so small presenting this statement,” Mr Abukwaik said.He described the pressure of having to boil your feelings about a loved one down into a few words – what if his sister-in-law or other family members wished he had said this or that instead? “How can one summarise the loss of a brother?” he asked.“What can I say about Osama? We shared the same room growing up. I watched him grow up. I knew him as a baby, a toddler, a kid, a teenager, as a young man and as a father. Above all, I knew him as a brother. It still sounds wrong to use the past tense. I wonder if it will ever sound right.”But Mr Abukwaik said he would “rather take a bullet” than let Tarrant hear him mourn his brother.“I will not entertain him by a single expression of loss,” he said.“I’m asking the honourable judge that you show the same mercy he showed to his victims.”For the rest of Tarrant’s life behind bars, Mr Abukwaik said, before he is offered any privileges or rewards, “ask if he regrets doing what he did”. “I am asking that he is declined anything beyond basic human rights,” he said. Mr Abukwaik asked that Justice Cameron Mander and others present “consider their own families, to take 15 seconds to pause, close your eyes and think of the closest member of your family” – the person they love the most.“Think what you would feel if this happened to you,” he said.For 15 long seconds, the court sat in silence.Think about the pain you would feel, Mr Abukwaik continued, at the loss of a loved one at the hands of a person who “does not know them but wants them dead”.Think of the memories you share with that person, “memories of happiness, sorrow, peace, fear and love”.“A loved one whom you’ve watched grow up, whom you’ve held when they are young,” he said. Justice Mander on Thursday sentenced Tarrant to life without parole for the first time in New Zealand’s history for the murders of 51 people.Tarrant also received a life sentence for committing a terrorist act, and concurrent 12-year life sentences on 40 counts of attempted murder.Before handing down his sentence, Justice Mander spoke a few words – clearly, like Youssef’s, carefully chosen – about each of the 91 victims.“Osama Adnan Abukwaik’s brother has told me of how he shared a room with Mr Abukwaik as they grew up together, and watched him become a man and a father,” he said.“He does not want to speak of him in the past tense, and wonders if that will ever seem right.”Justice Mander said that in sentencing Tarrant, he had “taken into account the undoubtedly stricter conditions of custody to which you will be subject”.He noted that “at least for the initial period of your sentence those custodial conditions will be onerous”.“They are of course to a large extent the product of the enormity of your crime but, in assessing the punitive effect of your incarceration, I am cognisant of their particularly restrictive nature,” he said. On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was “open to discussions” on whether the Australian-born terrorist should serve out his punishment in his home country.Mr Abukwaik is firmly against the idea. “The terrorist must serve the time in the same country where he committed the crime and under the watch of the law enforcement of the same justice system that issued the sentence,” he told news.com.au in an email.“He must not be transferred to Australia, or any other country for that matter.”Mr Abukwaik said he heard the voices calling for saving the precious tax dollars being “used to sustain a foreigner terrorist and murderer” – currently more than $NZ4930 per day due to the extra security.“It is definitely an expensive process,” he said. “It is even more painful for the victims’ families to know that some of our tax dollars are going to look after the murderer of our loved ones.”But this cost, he argues, is something New Zealand citizens and residents accept as part of adhering to the country’s laws and constitution.“I hear other voices calling to send him home,” he said.“He is not a soldier to be sent home – he is a terrorist and a murderer and must be locked up for life as ordered by the court of law.”Mr Abukwaik fears that it would not be possible for the New Zealand government to guarantee beyond doubt that Tarrant’s sentence would be enforced in another country.“This guarantee is simply not possible for a sentence with a relatively long duration, let alone for a sentence that doesn’t have a determined duration,” he said.“I spoke to many victims’ families and we most certainly want him under the watch of the New Zealand law enforcement and prison system.”Tarrant’s next trip to Australia, Mr Abukwaik said, “should be when his family receives his body – after he has completed his life sentence”. frank.chung@news.com.au

The Fed’s goals in its policy shift are broader than just employment; seeking modestly higher inflation would allow the central bank to raise rates higher down the road, giving it more room to later cut them — its standard stimulus response in the face of a downturn.
