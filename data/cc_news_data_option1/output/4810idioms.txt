Disney Plus is the Hollywood giant's hub for watching almost everything Disney produces. Disney Plus streams shows and movies from Disney franchises, including Star Wars, Marvel and Pixar, and all the family-friendly movies and animation from Disney itself. It also has originals, as well as programming it acquired by taking over Fox, such as The Simpsons and the X-Men movies.
 Its breakout hit The Mandalorian has returned, dropping new episodes every Friday, and a surprise Taylor Swift special going behind the scenes of making her album Folklore is set to be released Wednesday. After the coronavirus pandmeic not only delayed all of Disney Plus' Marvel TV shows but also pushed back the entire pipeline of Marvel big-screen movies, the first of Marvel original TV series, WandaVision, will premiere Jan. 15 on Disney Plus. WandaVision's will give fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe their first opportunity in a year and a half to step back into the narratives of the MCU.

Good luck with that.
 While many are undoubtedly heeding public health advice — downsizing Thanksgiving plans, avoiding get-togethers, wearing masks when they're around people who don't live with them — it's inevitable that a segment of the population will blow off new state and local restrictions and socialize anyway. Experts say that could put greater stress on overburdened hospitals and lead to an even bigger spike in sickness and death over the holidays.
 "When this started in early March, we weren't staring at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we didn't have the disease reservoir that we have. And that, to me, is the biggest concern in the next few weeks," said Dr. David Rubin, the director of PolicyLab at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He called the risk of a Thanksgiving spike "extremely high."
 "I think you're seeing a lot of resistance here," Rubin said. "I can't speculate on what people are going to do, but I can say that to the degree that there isn't a collective buy-in here, it sort of blunts the impact of the measures themselves."
 The nation is averaging 172,000 new virus cases per day, nearly doubling since the end of October, according to Johns Hopkins University. Hospitalizations, deaths and the testing positivity rate are also up sharply as the nation approaches Thanksgiving.
 In response, elected officials are imposing restrictions that, with some exceptions, fall short of the broad-based stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns seen in the spring.
 Utah and Vermont have banned all social gatherings. So have local governments in Philadelphia and Dane County, Wisconsin. In Kentucky, no more than eight people from two households are permitted to get together; in Oregon, the gathering limit is six. California has imposed an overnight curfew. More states are requiring masks, including those with GOP governors who have long resisted them. The nation's top health officials are pleading with Americans to avoid Thanksgiving travel.
 There's some evidence the holiday will be quieter.
 Tamika Hickson, who co-owns a party rental business in Philadelphia, said Thanksgiving was a bust even before her city moved to prohibit indoor gatherings of any size.
 "Nobody's calling," Hickson said. "A lot of people lost a lot of loved ones, so they're not playing with this. And I don't blame them."
 AAA projects Thanksgiving travel will fall by at least 10%, which would be the steepest one-year plunge since the Great Recession in 2008. But that still means tens of millions of people on the road. On social media, people defiantly talk about their Thanksgiving plans, arguing that nothing will stop them from seeing friends and family.

 “Daddy Long Legs,” a new production of the 2009 musical running through Saturday, has a streak of this lettered romanticism.

"In base alle indicazioni del commissario Arcuri il sistema sanitario regionale ha avviato la predisposizione del piano di fattibilita per la prima fase di somministrazione del vaccino per il Covid-19". Lo hanno annunciato il governatore Massimiliano Fedriga e il vicegovernatore con delega alla Salute, Riccardo Riccardi, i quali hanno evidenziato che "la struttura commissariale ci ha informati che gia dalla fine di gennaio 2021 l'Italia dovrebbe ricevere 3,4 milioni di dosi di vaccino Pfizer, sufficienti per 1,7 milioni di persone. Secondo quanto previsto da Arcuri la campagna vaccinale partira dai luoghi che, nel corso della pandemia, hanno rappresentato il principale canale di diffusione del virus, come ospedali e strutture residenziali per anziani".
 Fedriga e Riccardi hanno spiegato che "secondo quanto previsto a livello nazionale il vaccino sara inizialmente somministrato al personale sanitario nelle strutture ospedaliere e tramite unita mobili nelle case di riposo. Il vaccino Pfizer, che appare come il piu promettente tra quelli in fase di sviluppo, richiede infatti rigide misure di trasporto e conservazione, a partire dal mantenimento a temperature molto basse, che impongono l'individuazione di specifici siti di consegna".
 La Regione, attraverso una nota del governatore Fedriga, ha sottoposto al commissario Arcuri un piano articolato con i punti di consegna e distribuzione dei vaccini corrispondenti ai criteri stabiliti dalla struttura commissariale per garantire una migliore copertura del territorio regionale. "E' in corso il perfezionamento dell'individuazione delle strutture, definite in base al numero di operatori e alla prossimita con le strutture socio-assistenziali, che presumibilmente vedra coinvolti l'ospedale di Cattinara a Trieste, Santa Maria della Misericordia di Udine, quello di Gorizia, il Santa Maria degli Angeli di Pordenone, San Polo di Monfalcone e Sant'Antonio Abate di Tolmezzo", hanno chiarito il governatore e il vicegovernatore.
 "Inoltre, il sistema sanitario sta avviando le procedure per acquisire, anche attraverso la struttura commissariale, ulteriori dispositivi di conservazione di modo da garantire una maggiore capacita di stoccaggio dei vaccini".
 Fedriga e Riccardi hanno spiegato che "l'approvvigionamento dei vaccini per il Covid-19 e completamente nelle mani della struttura commissariale e il sistema sanitario regionale si occupera della sua somministrazione. In base alle stime effettuate seguendo i criteri posti dal commissario Arcuri, la Regione ha indicato un fabbisogno iniziale di dosi per vaccinare quasi 60mila persone, di cui quasi 48mila afferenti a vario titolo professionale al sistema sanitario e socio-assistenziale e circa 11mila per gli ospiti delle strutture per anziani. È quindi molto importante che il Governo, attraverso la struttura commissariale per l'emergenza Covid, riesca ad assicurare una quantita sufficiente di vaccini per coprire il fabbisogno del Friuli Venezia Giulia nei tempi previsti. Successivamente il Governo dara il via alle ulteriori fasi del piano vaccinale per l'estensione della vaccinazione alla piu ampia parte di popolazione possibile, a partire dalle persone con maggiori livelli di fragilita".

 “He has a chance to be here for a very, very long time because of his age,” manager Joe Girardi told the Phillies website. “And that’s what we’re looking for — stability.
 “If you listen to Caleb, he’s talked about getting to know every pitcher and giving them the information that they want and want to handle. Not saying, ‘You have to do it this way.’ He’s not going to take anything away from anyone. He’s going to look for every effort to make every pitcher better through his knowledge, which I think there’s a ton of. He’s not trying to make cookie-cutter pitchers. Zach Eflin is going to pitch different than Zack Wheeler. Zack Wheeler is going to pitch different than Aaron Nola. And he understands that.”
 Cotham made 35 appearances in the majors, including for the New York Yankees under Gerardi, and the Reds, where he worked with former Smyrna High rival and Vandy teammate Sonny Gray.
 “He was upper-80s, low-90s his senior year (at Mt. Juliet), so he had the stuff,” Purvis said. “When he went to Vanderbilt. I didn’t know how well he was going to do, but he turned out to be a weekend starter for them and did great things there and worked hard and just kept developing.
 “Just kept working all his way through… Kept his head down and kept working and kept getting better.”
 Analytics were just starting to gain a foothold in MLB while Cotham was in high school. But he always used his head as well as his arm.
 “He just knew the game,” Purvis said. “He was ahead of the game at his age as far as knowing the game. Just had a keen eye for everything. The analytics part, he was always a real smart kid.”

It doesn't support Wi-Fi 6, but the Nest Wifi mesh router still punches well above its weight with stable, reliable performance and enough advanced features to feel like an upgrade. The system's main router is the slightly bigger device on the left in the image above, and it'll work on its own without any of the range-extending Nest Wifi Point smart speakers.

 That's not a bad deal, but if you're starting from scratch, you're better off just getting the two-pack with the router and one extender at the normal $269 combo price (those extenders cost $150 on their own). However, if you use the first-gen Google Wifi mesh system in your home, you can swap in the Nest Wifi router and use it with your first-gen Google Wifi extenders for faster speeds and better performance.

The Del Mar City Council adopted a statement that lays out how the city will handles issues related to the rail line along the bluff.
 During the council’s Nov. 23 meeting, Deputy Mayor Terry Gaasterland said the statement will “clarify our approach and how we’re going to look at working with the (North County Transit District) on all the fencing questions.”
 The statement follows an NCTD report released in October that outlines a plan to add six-foot-tall chain-link fencing along the train tracks in an effort to reduce trespassing. Del Mar, Oceanside and Encinitas are the three cities with the highest rates of trespassing along the rail corridor. Many Del Mar residents are concerned that the fence would hinder beach access, ruin beachside views and have other potentially negative impacts.
 In response to that report, a post on the city of Del Mar’s website from October said the city hasn’t agreed to the fencing.
 “Del Mar will be working in collaboration with the California Coastal Commission, (the San Diego Association of Governments), and other regional agencies to ensure NCTD respects the rights, property, environmental and safety considerations along the Del Mar bluffs,” the post continued.
 A Del Mar city staff report for this week’s council meeting also mentions an NCTD petition to the Federal Surface Transportation Board that seeks to take away the regulatory authority of Del Mar and the state Coastal Commission over bluff stabilization, fencing and other potential projects on the bluff.
 Some of the priorities outlined in the statement are ensuring public safety, allowing the public safe access to the coast, mitigating any impacts to public and private property, maintaining trails and viewpoints, and listening to public input.
 Virtually all of the public input so far has been in opposition to the fencing. Del Mar City Councilman-elect Dan Quirk started a Change.org petition that has so far accumulated more than 5,000 signatures. It says the fencing would be “cutting off beach access for thousands of people, ruining the landscape, and creating safety risk for anyone caught inside the fence.”
 Del Mar Mayor Ellie Haviland said the city has received support from other government agencies.
 “SANDAG and the Coastal Commission have been incredibly supportive to Del Mar and our efforts in working with NCTD,” she said.
 Del Mar City Councilwoman Sherryl Parks alluded to the upcoming changes in city leadership, with two new council members to be sworn in next month, and the need to work together on the issue.
 “This is a difficult issue,” Parks said. “We all need to be on guard with this.”

Biden will nominate his longtime adviser Antony Blinken to be secretary of state, lawyer Alejandro Mayorkas to be homeland security secretary, Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be ambassador to the United Nations. Avril Haines, a former deputy director of the CIA, will be nominated as director of national intelligence, the first woman to hold that post.
 The incoming president will also appoint Jake Sullivan to be his national security adviser and Kerry to be his climate change envoy. Those posts do not require Senate confirmation.
 The choices reflect Biden’s emphasis on developing a diverse team with Thomas- Greenfield, a Black woman, at the helm of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and Mayorkas, a Cuban-American lawyer who will be the first Latino to lead Homeland Security.
 Thomas-Greenfield previously served in high-level State Department positions and Mayorkas was a deputy Homeland Security secretary under Obama.
 They “are experienced, crisis-tested leaders who are ready to hit the ground running on day one,” the transition said in a statement. “These officials will start working immediately to rebuild our institutions, renew and reimagine American leadership to keep Americans safe at home and abroad, and address the defining challenges of our time — from infectious disease, to terrorism, nuclear proliferation, cyber threats, and climate change.”
 In making the announcements, Biden moved forward with plans to fill out his administration even as Trump refuses to concede defeat in the Nov. 3 election, has pursued baseless legal challenges in several key states and has worked to stymie the transition process.
 The stakes of a smooth transition are especially high this year because Biden will take office amid the worst pandemic in more than a century, which will likely require a full government response to contain.
 “If confirmed, this is a mission I will take on with my full heart,” said Blinken who would take over the nation’s oldest Cabinet agency and be fourth in line for the presidency.
 Thomas-Greenfield — a career diplomat for more than 30 years serving as ambassador to Liberia, director general of the foreign service and assistant secretary of state for African affairs before being pushed out early in Trump’s presidency — paid tribute to her mother in accepting the nomination.
 “My mother taught me to lead with the power of kindness and compassion to make the world a better place,” she said in a tweet. “I’ve carried that lesson with me throughout my career in Foreign Service — and, if confirmed, will do the same as Ambassador to the United Nations.”

WandaVision, starring Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany, will be the first to debut, hitting Disney Plus on Jan. 15. It was originally set to come in December, following The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, itself originally planned to be its first live-action Marvel original series with an August release. But because of coronavirus disruptions, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier won't hit Disney Plus until sometime next year, and the release plans for other Marvel shows are unclear. A Loki series featuring Tom Hiddleston was slated for spring 2021, and a Hawkeye series was aimed for fall 2021, starring Jeremy Renner and featuring Kate Bishop, who in the comics becomes a second Hawkeye. But except for WandaVIsion, Disney hasn't specified release dates for any of the Marvel programs.
 Disney Plus has ramped up to 73.7 million subscribers, lightning-fast growth that even Disney never predicted. Initially, the company projected the service would reach between 60 million and 90 million subscribers about five years after launch. Instead, before completing year one, it's already comfortably inside that range. One media analyst called Disney Plus' rollout "one of the greatest product launches of all time."
 Disney's gangbusters launch of Disney Plus has helped all three of the company's streaming services -- Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus \-- to round out the top-five most popular US streaming-video subscriptions, according to estimates from researcher Parks Associates.

Disney Plus also competes with an emerging crop of new rivals like Peacock, Apple TV Plus and HBO Max.

Joining up with former Newcastle team-mate Joselu, Lejeune has already been dubbed a 'life-saver' for his performance in a 1-1 draw with Barcelona last month and has enabled 'Babazorros El Glorioso' to be 'evidently better defensively'.
 "I think the style of LaLiga suits him," Miller added.
 "He’s obviously dealt with a lot of injuries during his time at Newcastle, so a league that’s generally less physical and weighs more towards technical finesse means that there’s perhaps a little less pressure on his body in terms of wrestling opposition and impact in and around the box.
 "They’ve been evidently better defensively this season, still not without their problems but I think his presence at the back has given them an extra layer of confidence and experience.
 "He was a life-saver for Alavés against Barcelona in matchday eight.
 "He made a crucial goal-line block in the first half when Messi fired a really nicely hit free kick through traffic and he caused a lot of problems physically for Barça.
 "His size and strength played a big role in keeping their forwards out of the box, and one part of his personality I think is perhaps overlooked is his mental strength.
 "He shows leadership on the pitch, he’s surprisingly vocal, he communicates with Fernando Pacheco all throughout the game to keep the back line organised."

Minutes after liftoff, the spacecraft separated from the rocket’s first and second stages and slipped into Earth-moon transfer orbit.
 The launch was carried live by national broadcaster CCTV which then switched to computer animation to show its progress into outer space.
 The typically secretive administration had previously only confirmed the launch would be in late November. Spacecraft typically take three days to reach the moon.
 The mission’s key task is to drill 2 meters (almost 7 feet) beneath the moon’s surface and scoop up about 4.4 pounds of rocks and other debris to be brought back to Earth, according to NASA. That would offer the first opportunity for scientists to study newly obtained lunar material since the American and Russian missions of the 1960s and 1970s.
 The Chang’e 5 lander’s time on the moon is scheduled to be short and sweet. It can only stay one lunar daytime, or about 14 Earth days, because it lacks the radioisotope heating units to withstand the moon’s freezing nights.
 The lander will dig for materials with its drill and robotic arm and transfer them to what’s called an ascender, which will lift off from the moon and dock with the service capsule. The materials will then be moved to the return capsule to be hauled back to Earth.
 The technical complexity of Chang’e 5, with its four components, makes it “remarkable in many ways,” said Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert at the U.S. Naval War College.
 “China is showing itself capable of developing and successfully carrying out sustained high-tech programs, important for regional influence and potentially global partnerships,” she said.
 In particular, the ability to collect samples from space is growing in value, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Other countries planning to retrieve material from asteroids or even Mars may look to China’s experience, he said.

As a public, as community members, and as friends, family and neighbors to each other, we are all being called to do more than our individual parts. Doesn’t matter whether you believe in the virus or not, doesn’t matter if you have already had it and suffered only mild symptoms, doesn’t even matter if you are sick and tired of hearing about covid. We all share in this experience like no other experience in our lifetime. Our actions matter. Following masking protocols, physical distancing, hand hygiene, etc. are the ways we show up for each other. How you show up makes a statement.

"Lisandro Magallán hadn’t managed to nail down a regular starting spot, but his departure back to Ajax meant they needed to bring in another experienced defender.
 "I’d say it was a mixture of everything really. He’s obviously further down the pecking order at Newcastle and Alavés had the 3rd worst defensive record in LaLiga last season.
 "So it made a lot of sense to seek out a player who already had the experience and familiarity with playing in Spain from his previous spells at Eibar and, of course, at Girona under his new manager Pablo Machín.
 "His size and presence in the air would have been attractive to Alavés. None of their defenders are especially strong passers outside of maybe Rodrigo Ely, so Lejeune gives them another option to play out from the back.
 "I think he reads the game well which is a huge advantage for a team like this who know they aren’t likely to dominate possession in many of their games. They were also particularly susceptible to counter-attacks last season and his interception stats are historically pretty good so that should help with closing down attackers."
 Alaves are expected to battle relegation from La Liga this season but there is no doubt Lejeune has made a positive impact at the club.

Stuart's own route out of poverty came through fashion rather than writing. He studied textile design at college, moved to New York and forged a successful career in fashion with firms including Banana Republic. He began writing "Shuggie Bain" in 2008, driven by what he calls a "compulsion," not admitting even to himself that he was working on a novel.

Most major league pitchers were dominant in high school, blowing away hitters with 90-plus-mph heat.
 As a Mt. Juliet High School Golden Bear, Caleb Cotham was a pitcher and went through a game with his mind as much as his right arm. That approach earned him a spot on Vanderbilt’s vaunted staff, a pro career and a couple of major- league rosters. It also paved a pathway to a post-playing career in the game.
 It earned him the job as Philadelphia Phillies pitching coach, it was announced Friday.

But prisons are a particular concern because social distancing is virtually nonexistent behind bars, inmates sleep in close quarters and share bathrooms with strangers. In the early days of the pandemic, prisoners and staff members said the Bureau of Prisons had run short of even the most basic supplies, like soap.

With the "Want Me 2 Stay" video arriving just ahead of Thanksgiving, Bootsy also offered a note for what will be a very unusual and difficult holiday season during the pandemic: "Thanksgiving is such a family-fun time, that it is really hard to face the reality that we now live in. But we have to encourage each other to stay diligent because love is deeper than our physical realm of contact. We must learn to dig deeper to reconnect with the One in all of us. We have all reached that fork in the road, and we are all standing there wondering which road leads us out."

 Eastern Howard School Corporation Superintendent [EHSC] Keith Richie, like other local superintendents, wants to make sure students stay healthy and are ready to finish out the year in-person.
 “I asked [the parents and students] … let’s just work together in and out of school to avoid spreading this virus,” he said, adding that he thanks the parents for their cooperation. “It’s important to me and it’s important to the local health officials. We want all our kids back after next week.”
 Richie said the safest place for the kids is the school and most of the positive test’s EHSC has had are coming in from the community and affecting the ability to operate. He added everyone should listen to the health officials.
 “I’m not the person who would say, ‘Don’t celebrate with your family,’ but maybe not with your extended family,” he said, and noted Zoom as a way to connect with that extended family.
