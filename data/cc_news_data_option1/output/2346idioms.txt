 Harmon, 25, was pronounced dead at the scene Saturday night after he was struck while swimming by another boater. The 26-year-old driver of the other boat, Walker O’Connor, was arrested on suspicion of boating under the influence, according to the Pensacola News Journal. He was sent to the Escambia County Jail and bonded out for $1,000.
 Assistant State Attorney Greg Marcille spoke with the News Journal and said prosecutors were reviewing the case to determine if additional charges would filed against O’Connor, who was arrested after the accident, which occurred around 7:30 p.m.

By Christopher Condon and Craig Torres Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the US economy may be entering a period of significant improvements in employment, but one that will leave the labor market “well short” of the robust levels seen just before the coronavirus pandemic. “We would expect to see large numbers of people during this period coming back to work during this second period, call it the bounce back or the beginning of the recovery,” Powell said Tuesday as he testified via video conference before the Senate Banking Committee. “Then we think, and I think most if not all forecasters think, that will leave us well short of where we were in February,” he added. Significant Uncertainty With that observation, along with his prepared remarks Tuesday, Powell offered another restrained assessment of positive economic news, choosing again to emphasize the US economy has a long way to go before it reverses the substantial damage done by the coronavirus pandemic. “Recently, some indicators have pointed to a stabilization, and in some areas a modest rebound, in economic activity,” Powell said Tuesday in his opening statement. “That said, the levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery,” he added. Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, in a note to clients said Powell “continues to see the glass as more than half empty. He is very worried about permanent damage from the lockdown-induced downturn, even if it is over.” Powell was repeatedly asked by senators about economic inequality and the unemployment rates for low-income and Black Americans in light of protests sweeping the nation over police brutality and racial disparities. The Fed chair noted the disproportionate impact of job losses on low-income Americans and minorities saying the economic pain was hitting hardest on those who can least afford it. “If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing,” he said. The Fed since mid-March lowered interest rates to near zero, purchased trillions in bonds to settle panicked credit markets and unveiled nine emergency lending programs to help households, companies, states and local governments battle through hardships created by the pandemic. 76410046 Powell reviewed the steps the central bank has taken and repeated that policy makers are “committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.” Asked about the potential for the central bank to cap the yield on Treasury securities at certain maturities -- a strategy known as yield-curve control -- Powell said policy makers were in the early stage of evaluating that option. “We’ve made absolutely no decision to go forward on it,” he said. The chair’s remarks came on the heels of surprisingly good data on consumer demand released earlier Tuesday. The Commerce Departments said US retail sales rose in May by a better-than- expected 17.7 per cent, the biggest jump in data going back to 1992. That follows a 14.7 per cent slump in April. 76410060 The May payrolls report, out June 5, also came in unexpectedly strong. But just as he did after that report, Powell nodded to the good news and then reminded Americans that much remains unclear about the fledgling recovery. “Much of that economic uncertainty comes from uncertainty about the path of the disease and the effects of measures to contain it,” he said. “Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely.” He repeated that the weeks of economic disruption as a result of the pandemic risk causing long-term scars -- by leaving millions out of work for an extended period and by destroying small businesses. Heart of Economy “If a small- or medium-sized business becomes insolvent because the economy recovers too slowly, we lose more than just that business,” he said. “These businesses are the heart of our economy and often embody the work of generations.” Projections released last week showed Fed officials expect the US economy to contract by 6.5 per cent this year, followed by 5 per cent growth next year. Those forecasts fit well with Powell’s remarks, anticipating a long, steady struggle for the US economy, as opposed to a rigorous rebound. For example, policy makers’ median projections pointed to unemployment ending this year at 9.3 per cent, and declining slowly to 6.5 per cent by the end of 2021. Unusual for a Fed chair, he also came back to subject of race at the end of his prepared remarks. “I speak for my colleagues throughout the Federal Reserve System when I say there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism and there should be no place for it in our society,” he said. “Everyone deserves the opportunity to participate fully in our society and in our economy.”

 I've heard you say this before, \"I want to spend all of my money so that my children inherit nothing.\" In reality, this doesn't happen too often, and you're still tasked with the tough decision of how to split up your assets upon your passing.
 Equal is a common route, but not the only one. The facts and circumstances that come into play when making this decision are the age of your children, their lives' paths, and their overall health and well-being will help to make the best decision to keep harmony in your family beyond your lifetime.
 If your children are young, with their life path the furthest thing from their mind, you're almost forced to divide assets equally. This is best accomplished using a trust so that a responsible adult or fiduciary can be appointed to oversee the assets for your children. That fiduciary shall control how the funds are invested and make decisions regarding distributions according to the terms of the trust. It's also common to see these assets pooled together so that all of your desired life expenses of a child are funded until the youngest is ready to support themselves.
 An exception to this rule may be a child identified with special needs. These circumstances make the planning a little more complicated. Consider talking to a planning professional about a special needs trust for that child to protect the money.
 As you age and your children begin maturing, their lives and paths will unfold in front of your eyes. Beyond the joy of seeing these paths develop is the heartache of day to day living. Some will have stable careers with benefits, and others may not. Some will be successful in business, others will not. Some will have a happy home life, and some will not. Some will be healthy, and some will not.
 As their lives unfold, it's OK to have different thoughts regarding the division of your assets. There's no law that says equal is the only way. The discussion about how to divide assets between your pre-school teaching son and your high flying CEO daughter can favor those who 'need' it the most or whatever other criteria you think matter. In fact, in cases where I've witnessed disparities such as these, the already wealthy child often is adamant about leaving more to their lower earning sibling.
 Equal or not, one must also consider what is being inherited. Is $1 million cash the same as receiving a house valued at $1 million? Different facts, different answers. Every family will have their unique answer to this question. These aren't technical issues, they're family issues. You can get the technical help you may need from a good financial planner. The technical issues are the valuation of the property, any costs to turn it into cash, income and estate taxes and any other obligations of the property such as deferred maintenance or other issues that should be resolved before the change of ownership.

CLEVELAND, Ohio (WOIO) - The Cleveland Clinic has developed a risk prediction model, a calculator that researchers say can predict your risk of developing Covid-19, which in turn can help them guide resources to those who are most at risk.The risk prediction model was based on the extensive research of 12,000 patients in Ohio, including those who tested positive and negative; it also isolated 400 variables and subsequently used that data in statistical algorithms to produce the risk calculator.“We wanted to generate, based on all that information, a tool at the end of the day that could be usable and accurate,” said Dr. Lara Jehi, the Clinic’s Chief Research Information Officer.Cleveland Clinic research shows the model is about 85 percent accurate while taking into account age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, vaccination history plus various medical history.It takes only minutes to complete the questions in the risk calculator and your percentage risk of developing Covid-19 is available immediately.The assessment allows doctors to gauge risk and then provide guidance to those at the highest risk.“Making sure that patients who are at risk, get followed more intensely in our home monitoring program,” Dr. Jehi said.The prediction model will not only help doctors understand who is at risk of developing Covid but also, Dr. Jehi said, who is at risk of developing a severe case.“We’re looking also at who is at risk at ending up at the hospital, we’re looking at who is at risk of ending up in the ICU,” she said.An individualized specific risk assessment for everyone was the goal, but the research also provided new insight into Covid 19.“We identified certain factors that could influence the risk of having Covid which we did not know before,” Dr. Jehi said.Those factors will be studied in clinical trials at the Cleveland Clinic.Copyright 2020 WOIO.

Schippers emphasized the uncertainty of the situation.
 “After thoroughly reevaluating our business in light of the ongoing pandemic, we wanted to communicate honestly and openly with our team members that it could be some time before all of our remaining properties are open, and that those properties that are open will unfortunately not require the same level of staffing going forward," Schippers said.
 "As a result," he added, "we informed our team members that their furloughs may be converted to a permanent layoff in the coming weeks or months. We had a legal obligation to send a formal WARN notice to all the team members who could potentially be laid off. To be clear, however, that does not necessarily mean that all those team members will be laid off."
 When the company announced temporary layoffs at the end of March, it established a special COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund under the Penn National Gaming Foundation to provide assistance to team members and local relief organizations in communities served by the company.
 Schippers said senior executives had donated to the fund and that the company will be extending medical and pharmacy benefits through July.
 “In the meantime, we also wanted to let the furloughed team members know that we’ll be extending their medical and pharmacy benefits coverage through July 31," Schippers said. "In addition, our COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund, in which we’ve raised $1.7 million through private donations from our senior executives, board of directors, and our foundation, is also available to help our team members with any emergency funding needs.
 "To date, we’ve received over 3,000 applications for support and more than $415,000 has already been approved and processed for distribution.

 Harmon, who was born in Lawrenceville, excelled for both the baseball and football teams at Mill Creek, where he graduated in 2013. His father, Vernon, was a longtime assistant football coach at Mill Creek.
 He was a second-team all-county selection in baseball as a senior in 2013 when he hit .360 with 17 stolen bases. He helped the Hawks to three straight region titles his final three high school seasons.
 As a defensive back in football, he made 72 tackles as a senior for a state quarterfinal team which earned the first home playoff game in school history. One of his highlight plays that season was a blocked field goal was time expired in a 17-14 win over Collins Hill.

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Tuesday reported a steep 99 per cent drop in its net profit to Rs 27 crore for the March quarter as refining margins plunged and inventory losses mounted because of a sharp fall in international oil prices.The company had posted a net profit of Rs 2,970 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.&quot;The drop in net profit was mainly because of inventory losses and exchange rate fluctuations,&quot; HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana told reporters.The company suffered an inventory loss of Rs 4,113 crore in the January-March 2020 quarter as compared with an inventory gain of Rs 1,224 crore in the same period a year back, he said.An inventory loss is booked when a company buys raw material (crude oil) at a particular price but by the time it is able to ship it to the refinery and process it, international rates have fallen. As refinery-gate prices are aligned to prevailing benchmark international rates, an inventory loss is booked. Inventory gain happens if the reverse happens.Also, the company had a foreign exchange loss of Rs 975 crore as compared to a gain of 256 crore in January-March 2019.HPCL had a negative earning of USD 1.23 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in the quarter as compared to a gross refining margin of USD 4.51 a barrel last year.&quot;Not accounting for inventory losses, the GRM was USD 9.37 per barrel in Q4 of 2019-20 fiscal as compared to USD 0.85 a barrel in the same period a year back,&quot; he said.For the January-March 2020 period, HPCL registered gross sales of Rs 71,268 crore as compared to Rs 72,840 crore for the period January to March 2019. &quot;Sales were lower mainly on account of sharp fall in crude prices during the current quarter,&quot; he said.HPCL recorded domestic sales volume of 9.25 million tonnes in the fourth quarter, against 10.03 million tonnes in the corresponding quarter of the previous financial year.&quot;The drop in sales is mainly due to the reduction in transportation fuel demand for fuel in the month of March 2020 due to nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID 19,&quot; he said.Demand has since last month started to pick up with the easing of lockdown restrictions and are now 82-85 per cent of the normal levels, he said adding demand had fallen to just 30 per cent in April.By end June or early July, demand would reach 90 per cent, he said adding in the current quarter there will be inventory gains from oil prices rising from USD 13 per barrel to USD 40.The firm's refineries at Mumbai and Visakh processed 4.54 million tonnes of crude during January-March.&quot;The financial year 2019-20 especially in the last quarter has seen unprecedented events like outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to nationwide lockdowns and demand contraction on the back of generally sluggish global economic activities.&quot;This coupled with inability of oil-producing countries to reach a consensus to re-balance the supply-demand situation led to unprecedented volatility in crude oil and product prices and also in exchange rates. Surplus inventories, lower demand and geo-political situations led to one of the steepest fall in crude oil prices seen in the last two decades,&quot; Surana said.The nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the pandemic in India led to significant demand contraction in the last part of March 2020 necessitating regulated refinery operations.&quot;During this period, HPCL continued its operations without any disruption to ensure availability of LPG, petrol and diesel for essential services and general public while ensuring the safety and wellbeing of its stakeholders and the workforce,&quot; he added.In the full financial year 2019-20, HPCL had a net profit of Rs 2,637 crore as compared to Rs 6,029 crore for the previous year. &quot;The decrease in net profit is mainly because of the impact of inventory losses due to sharp fall in crude prices and exchange rate fluctuations,&quot; he said.Gross sales in 2019-20 was Rs 2,86,250 crore, compared Rs 2,95,713 crore for the previous year.HPCL achieved a combined gross refining margin of USD 1.02 per barrel during the year as compared to USD 5.01 per barrel during 2018-19. &quot;GRMs were lower in comparison to previous year mainly due to inventory losses and reduced cracks in diesel, LPG and fuel oil,&quot; he said.During 2019-20, HPCL achieved the highest-ever sales volume of 39.6 million tonnes compared to the previous year's sales of 38.7 million tonnes.For the year 2019-20, HPCL has proposed a final dividend of Rs 9.75 per share.

 The testing done on the pitch has been promising and the players have already had a chance to get accustomed to playing in their new surroundings, while the timing of City's games should counter any potential problems caused by warm weather; five of City's six scheduled home matches so far are in the evening, which should help keep the pitch watered.
