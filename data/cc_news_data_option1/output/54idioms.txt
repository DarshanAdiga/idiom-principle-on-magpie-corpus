NEW YORK — Riding in a venue where he has found plenty of success, reigning Professional Bull Riders world champion Jess Lockwood saved his best ride for last on Sunday afternoon at Madison Square Garden.
 Lockwood scored a crowd-pleasing 91.75-point ride on Lil 2 Train to win the championship round and record the high-marked ride of the PBR Unleash The Beast Monster Energy Buck Off at The Garden. The score propelled him to a third-place finish and $23,850 and 121.5 world standings points.
 The event, which Lockwood won last year and in 2017 when he also captured the world championship, was the season-opening stop on the premier series tour and is one of the circuit’s majors.

I wanted to spread the good word. I even briefly considered leaving my old life behind and becoming cruise director myself. This was my complete and complete turn in seven short nights on board. I waived David Foster Wallace and promised my loyalty to King Triton. Or whoever it was that these sea people worshiped. I was still new, I wasn't sure. But I was firmly convinced that this was the way for me. If you are just playing with the idea of ​​converting, keep in mind that we have free lobster tails here.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Narrowly missing out on an NFC playoff bye came back to haunt the Saints right away.
 A series of missed opportunities led to yet another excruciating exit from the postseason — this time in a 26-20 overtime loss at home to sixth-seeded Minnesota. The Vikings won three fewer games than the Saints in the regular season but outplayed them most of the way Sunday before winning on tight end Kyle Rudolph’s 4-yard touchdown reception on the first series of the extra session.
 The silence in the Saints locker room reflected the reality of a third consecutive playoff loss on the last play. In 2017, the Vikings scored on Stefon Diggs’ 61-yard touchdown as time ran out in Minneapolis. Last year, the Los Angeles Rams won the NFC championship game on a field goal in overtime in the Superdome.

“You invest so much into it and have invested so much into it so you understand that these opportunities are few,” quarterback Drew Brees said. “So, yeah, it’s disappointing. If you’re not holding up the trophy at the end of the year, it’s disappointing.”
 The Saints sent the game to overtime on Wil Lutz’s 49-yard kick with 2 seconds left in regulation, but were kicking themselves for all of their uncharacteristic failures before and after the field goal.
 Brees, who helped the Saints set an NFL record for fewest turnovers with eight in the regular season, had two costly ones. Safety Anthony Harris intercepted his deep pass for Ted Ginn Jr. into double coverage late in the second quarter, setting up Dalvin Cook’s 5-yard touchdown run as the Vikings went ahead for the first time, 13-10.
 “We were trying to catch them off guard,” Brees said. “We felt like Teddy was making his way over the top and could make a nice play.”
 With the Saints trailing 20-17, defensive end Danielle Hunter stripped Brees on a sack with 4:18 left after Taysom Hill’s 28-yard run to the Vikings 20.
 “The fumble’s really frustrating because there was miscommunication as to what we were doing,” Brees said. “The ball should have been out of my hands and all of a sudden that wasn’t the route that was run, so now I’m just trying to throw the ball into the dirt to avoid a sack, right? And right as my hand’s going back he just kind of gets a piece of my arm and that ball comes out. ... That never should have happened.”
 The Vikings converted 10 of 18 third downs, a higher percentage than anyone the Saints played in the regular season, when they limited opponents to a 34.8 percent success rate.
 Cook rushed for 84 yards in the first half, more than the Saints had allowed for a full game to any other running back. Although he finished with 94, his early success helped keep Brees and the Saints offense off the field as Minnesota controlled the ball for nearly 19 of the first 30 minutes.
 “We knew they were going to try to run the stretch and test the perimeter,” Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan said. “We didn’t do enough to stop that.”
 Lutz missed a field goal at the end of the first half — just his fifth miss in 39 kicks this season.
 New Orleans also had two crucial penalties. A false start nullified Hill’s conversion of a fake punt after the Saints fell behind 20-10 in the third quarter. An illegal shift on a Brees intentional spike cost the Saints 5 yards and a 10-second runoff in the final minute, turning what would have been a second down at the Minnesota 26 with 21 seconds left into a second down at the 31 with 11 seconds remaining.

It will be revolutionary when superfast 5G mobile networks come to our gadgets, cars and digital lives.
 But the road to 5G remains agonizingly slow at the massive Consumer Electronics Show opening this week in Las Vegas, where ultrafast products are expected to be few and far between.
 Backers of 5G tout a cornucopia of potential applications, but networks are still nascent, as are the devices capable of accessing them.

US President Donald Trump doubled down Sunday on a threat to attack Iranian cultural sites despite accusations that any such strike would amount to a war crime.
 After his top diplomat, Mike Pompeo, had insisted that any military action would conform to international law, Trump said he would regard cultural sites as fair game if Iran resorted to deadly force against US targets.
 "They're allowed to kill our people, they're allowed to torture and maim our people, they're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people and we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way," Trump told reporters.
 "If they do anything there will be major retaliation."
