The theme for the October-November session will be animal adaptation, where students will learn about and meet animals that have adaptations that help them survive in the wild. Students will meet wild animals, play games and solve puzzles to apply each new concept, and classes will spend large portions of classes touring exhibits and working on applications outside. Students will be provided journals for their notes, pictures and activities.

When it comes to dealing with debt collectors, keep track of all the calls and emails. Write down the names of anyone you talk to and when they called. A record of all contact is important, and it will make it easier to report them if they violate the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If the collector agrees to settle the debt, get it in writing and keep the document as proof in case they “forget” they made the offer.
 Also, be completely up to speed on your accounts. Know what you owe, who you owe, and have a record of all the payments you’ve made. Knowing the facts gives you the upper hand in any situation. Don’t be intimidated by debt collectors, either. Calmly explain your situation, the reason you’re behind on the debt, and how you plan to pay it off. Don’t get emotional and let yourself get drawn into an argument or shouting match. If they insult you, or yell or curse at you—yes, this happens sometimes—hang up immediately.
 Financial troubles like debt can make every aspect of your life feel messed up. If you want to get back on track, start living on a written, monthly budget, and attack your debts using the debt snowball system. It’s not easy, and it takes discipline, hard work, and sacrifices, but it’s worth it!

Now, here’s where it gets real. Subtract your income from your expenses. Ideally, this number will be zero. It might take some practice, so don’t be discouraged if everything doesn’t balance out perfectly the first few times. All that means is you need to find a way to bring one of the numbers up, the other one down—or both. But whatever you do, don’t spend a dime that’s not accounted for.
 If you have a problem with spending more than you make, make some cuts in order to equalize your income and your outgo. Using coupons, cutting back on groceries, or carpooling to work are great ideas to reduce spending. If you want to generate more money, get a second job on weekends or sell some stuff.
 You’re the boss of the budget—in the beginning. Once it’s committed to paper, in a spreadsheet, or on an app like EveryDollar, the budget is the boss!

  _Handling debt collectors_
 Dear Dave,
 Do you have suggestions on how to interact with debt collectors? Sometimes they are reasonable and easy to work with, but others are rude and pushy. Your advice would be appreciated.
  _—Paul_
 Dear Paul,
 You’ll run into all sorts of collectors, no matter what kind of debt you have. Occasionally they are friendly and understanding, while others can be downright mean and nasty. Whatever their approach is, you have to keep in mind they’re all after one thing—your money.
 Most debt collectors prey on a person’s emotions and lack of confidence. If you don’t know your rights, they can scare you by using bogus threats. Understand what I’m saying here, Paul. If you have debt, you have a legal and moral obligation to pay it. At the same time, you need to calmly and confidently control these kinds of conversations. You might have made some financial mistakes, but that doesn’t mean you should allow someone to abuse you.
 When it comes to dealing with debt collectors, keep track of all the calls and emails. Write down the names of anyone you talk to and when they called. A record of all contact is important, and it will make it easier to report them if they violate the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. If the collector agrees to settle the debt, get it in writing and keep the document as proof in case they “forget” they made the offer.
 Also, be completely up to speed on your accounts. Know what you owe, who you owe, and have a record of all the payments you’ve made. Knowing the facts gives you the upper hand in any situation. Don’t be intimidated by debt collectors, either. Calmly explain your situation, the reason you’re behind on the debt, and how you plan to pay it off. Don’t get emotional and let yourself get drawn into an argument or shouting match. If they insult you, or yell or curse at you—yes, this happens sometimes—hang up immediately.

Relaxing the quarantine rule and changes in guidelines related to COVID 19 protocols were some of the suggestions made by industry experts to Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Saturday for return of live sports events in India.The experts said with no live sports events the sector has taken a huge hit this year."In 2019, the live sports events sector in India touched 9,100 crores and without COVID this sector would have easily touched Rs 10,000 crores this year. However, that could not happen and now the revenue loss due to COVID across the board, including media is approximately Rs 4,000 crore," said Vivek Singh Joint MD of Procam International, during a webinar organized by SPORTSCOM, an industry think-tank body. The session saw experts in sports business industry and former athletes including Pullela Gopichand, Ashwini Nachappa, Viren Rasquinha, besides Udit Sheth, founder of SE TransStadia and CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee , addressing sports minister Rijiju.Singh said there are several key challenges that need to be addressed for bringing back sports competition. These are quarantine rules, unavailability of events cancellation insurance, and promoters' liability."Overseas athlete are today subject to about 12 days of quarantine and multiple COVID tests etc. We are concerned that such a long quarantine would affect the participation of elite athletes in sporting events in India. Our appeal to the ministry is that a COVID negative certificate within 72 hours of their taking a flight and another negative test within 36 hrs of their arrival in India and the creation of a bio bubble by the event promoter should be enough for participation. The quarantine rule should be relooked at the earliest.""Established COVID 19 protocol must be in place for all events and when the event has followed all the protocols, the event promoter should not be held liable for a COVID case. Each participating individual, player or official should be personally responsible for his own safety."He also said the events cancellation insurance especially when taken by a private body for COVID 19 is not readily available by insurance companies. "We don't know how to deal with this and any assistance from the ministry of sports would help."Sports Minister Rijiju said he would soon like to see return of live sports in India. "We are trying to resume all sports training activities by October. We have no sporting competitions now but as I see things emerging, hopefully a vaccine will come out soon. Early next year, we will have some kind of very fascinating events back in the field," the Sports Minister said. Uniformity in GSTNeeraj Jain, Director, COSCO, India, called for uniformity of GST across sports and fitness sector. "The uniformity of GST in manufacturing segment if done at 12% would mean 50% jump in the growth of domestic market sales. While apparel and shoe manufacturing are not included in Sports Manufacturing sector, the market size alone for these two product stands at 1,7000 crores and needs a nodal agency to recognise an make Indian Sports Manufacturing Sector Atmanirbhar."

Last month’s update in the WMI on the tragic case of the Rawlings family made me (and probably everyone else) sad all over again. A heartbreaking story with, except for the attorneys, no winners.
 As I read RT Lynch’s compelling reporting, I was impressed again with the man’s skill in making a labyrinth of legal maneuverings understandable. For a few minutes, anyway; my brain has turned to mush, so I don’t remember much after twenty minutes, but I sure appreciate it at the time.
 I saved the story from the paper without really knowing why. Later in the day, it dawned on me that it (like most reports on court cases dealing with multiple deaths) would be with us for the foreseeable future. While it’s been ‘only’ a year of charges, hearings, court dates, and myriad other wranglings, there’s still no end in sight for a resolution to this case. A sharp contrast to a tale I recently told in a family collection I’d put together.
 My 4th great-grandfather had, among other children, a son who, according to newspaper reports and court documents of the time, killed a law officer “…with the single stroke of an axe, which nearly severed his head from his body…” All in all, it was a disturbing account of a rotten fellow who’d made some really poor choices and took an innocent life with little remorse.
 I’m glad that this guy wasn’t my direct-line ancestor! Luckily, his sister, my 3rd great-grandmother, hasn’t shown up in any court records I’ve found. It’s fascinating to me that people who lived good, hardworking lives rarely have their stories told. Except for birth, marriage, and death records, it’s the worst of the scofflaws who turn up in legal filings and newspapers.
 What brought RT Lynch’s reporting and this tale of mine together in my mind is the timeline. My sorry uncle committed murder on May 30, 1822, and was apprehended 8 days later. Within the month of June, the trial was held and on November 1, 1822, in front of a crowd of 4,000, he was hanged. Five months from start to finish. Now is that efficiency, or what?
 Today, it can take many years to get a final verdict on even the most cut-and- dried cases. Then, if the death penalty is imposed, inmates can spend up to 40 years (being cared for at taxpayer expense!) waiting for the execution to be carried out. Recently in Texas, a guy was scheduled to die on Sept. 30, but the date was withdrawn due to COVID-19. Please don’t tell me I’m the only one who finds that ludicrous!
 While we should all take crime and punishment very seriously, the CYA industry that has built up around the legal and judicial fields means that not only is justice usually delayed, but it is often non-existent. Innocent families of both victims and perpetrators have their lives upended for years on end through no fault of their own. Not a situation for our society to be proud of.
