Increasingly it has become hard for me not to notice trends that are occurring in real time directly before my eyes. So-called peaceful protests that burn, loot and kill people, all to the mantra of “No justice! No peace!” I see this as tragically ironic.
 I see that the BLM movement has become a lucrative fundraising arm (via Act Blue) for the Democratic Party and uses “in your face” tactics of demanding that you either submit to their pronouncements or you will be blacklisted, pilloried, cast down, castigated and torn from the pages of history — or else!
 I see that Antifa is a violent Marxist organization that is not afraid to use fear to get what they want by any means possible. It also appears that all they really want is for the complete and total destruction of America. I see the setting for open conflict being staged, I see our history being torn down, bad-mouthed, set on fire and weaponized to achieve a very specific outcome to totalitarian Marxism. All while the vast majority of Americans remain clueless. Simply doing their very best to put food on the table while going about their daily lives.
 I see that medical science, along with any potential cures and treatments for COVID-19, are so obscured by the media that it is hard to get a straight answer on anything that even remotely resembles a clear path forward. I see that the schools are trying to be controlled by so many different agenda- driven special interest groups that our school systems have become a minefield of dysfunction wrapped in a world of paranoia and lost dreams. Schools have such a heartfelt grasp on all of us. All that good people really want for their children is a healthy and fun environment while enjoying a touch of the American dream. Simply put, we want a great educational experience for our kids. But, this multi-billion dollar enterprise also involves huge egos, all their own demands, and all vying for power and control. To me this is an enigma wrapped in a shouting match.
 I see polite conversations instantly turning to “hot” by one mere “slip” in speech that triggers some perceived “righteous indignation” (which of course is anything but). Obviously facts must never be allowed within certain topics! I see too many uninformed people who can’t even begin to fathom the “big picture” and how there are secondary and tertiary effects to every choice that must be made. There are exactly zero “no risk” scenarios to our current predicament. At every point in our journey we must take our best shot and move forward. Collectively, as a society, we must do the same thing. It’s time to choose wisely, then run with grace, dignity and fearlessness into the future. As a nation, will we always make the right choice? Heck no! But we can learn to compensate, correct our course and continue the journey set before us. Together we will learn from our lessons while endeavoring to do better.
 I clearly see that we are within the matrix of “may you live in exciting times” as the ancient Chinese curse so clearly warned. And, that too, is more than tragically ironic.

Despite closings, renovations and change, Jennii said she and Adrian are committed to continuing their service to the Norman community.
 In order to add more to their menu, Jennii said she went to the Texas Coffee School to learn how to make quality coffee drinks. The couple is also purchasing all their coffee from Oklahoma City outfit KLLR Coffee to support a fellow local business.
 While building their shaved ice and coffee empire, Jennii said she and Adrian are trying to diverge from the typical culture of coffee shops to make their locations more inviting to families, while still providing a comforting environment.
 “I think most coffee shops cater to adults or students, and they want it to be very trendy, like a chill, relaxed environment,” Jennii said. “And while we want that too, we also want those moms that have young children to have a place to come and meet up together. We want families to come here and feel comfortable. ... So for our coffee shop here we have students that come and study, we have adults that have their meetup, but we welcome families from all walks of life. We welcome everybody to come here to be able to enjoy.”
 Jennii said Beanstalk will continue to participate in fundraisers with anyone who wishes to host them while also coordinating with Norman Public Schools and OU to offer promotions for students and teachers.
 Besides its approach to customer and community service, Jennii said Beanstalk is unique because it’s one of the few drive-thru coffee options in Norman that also takes a different approach to coffee. Beanstalk provides several options, from basic coffee and snow cones to drinks that combine those two items to create special flavors.
 As the Buendias close the door on the Eskimo Sno and move forward with their new brand, Jennii said there’s some magic in the Beanstalk name an employee came up with during a brainstorming session.
 “Instantly I had the imagery of Jack and the Beanstalk and having magic beans, which you can relate to coffee beans, and the Beanstalk goes up in the air where there's snow and it's cold, and we have snow, so it made sense,” Jennii said. “And that name was very whimsical and fairy-tale like, and I knew that would be something that everybody can relate to. Everybody knows the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and I knew it was something we could turn into something special.”

“We need to know what their diagnosis is so that we can take the best care of them and also so that we can keep our employees safe,” McCloskey said.
 McCloskey also said the lab experienced a large uptick in the number of tests they process in comparison to a busy flu season. McCloskey said the lab would normally encounter approximately 650 respiratory virus tests per week, but he said now with COVID-19, they are seeing approximately 1,200 to 1,300 per day.
 McCloskey said the situation has taken “significant investment and support.”
 Talbert said the lab will continue to increase testing.
 “I think that the general consensus is that we’re (going to) be living with (COVID-19) for at least a while, and I think additional testing will be needed — certainly for the foreseeable future,” Talbert said.
 While most may be familiar with the traditional nasal swab, McCloskey said the lab has the ability to test multiple forms of specimens like oropharyngeal swabs and nasal collection but primarily deals with the traditional nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs.
 McCloskey said oropharyngeal swabs are similar to a test you may receive for strep throat, and nasal collection tests can be administered by the patient while observed by a healthcare worker. These tests are primarily used in community-based screening testing and require less use of personal protective equipment.

But then viewers start to see a change in Trip. During the regiment's ill- fated charge on Fort Wagner, a white regiment looks on. Trip catches the eye of a white soldier he had previously scuffled with. Trip looks away, and the white solider shouts, "Give 'em hell 54th!" Trip grins, and all the white soldiers cheer on the 54th. In the final sequence of the film, with the regiment hunkered down at the parapet, the white colonel decides to lead them onward and is shot down immediately. First to rise, hoisting the regimental flag, Trip shouts to his comrades, "Come on!" He, too, is shot down. "Glory" ends with the colonel's and Trip's bodies being tossed into a trench grave, side-by-side.
