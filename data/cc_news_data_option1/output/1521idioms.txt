Meulensteen's men could move out of the bottom three with a win over the Yorkshire club at the KC Stadium as Fulham bid to build on a 2-1 victory over Norwich City on Thursday, but the 49-year-old knows that will be no easy feat against a Hull team narrowly beaten 3-2 by Premier League champions Manchester United on the same day.
 Bruce spent nine years under United legend Alex Ferguson as a player before moving into management. And Meulensteen - who worked as an assistant to Ferguson at United from 2007 to 2013 - feels Bruce's time at Old Trafford has influenced the former Sunderland manager's approach.
 "Any manager that has worked or played under Sir Alex Ferguson will have remembered things that they will use," Meulensteen said.
 "I'm sure Steve will be no different. Sir Alex always wanted teams to play with a lot of endeavour and speed - you have to see what you have at your disposal but the intentions are there, you only have to look at Hull's 3-1 win over Liverpool.
 "He has got his feet under the table in the Premier League, you have an experience of knowing how to play away at all the different grounds and it doesn't faze him anymore.
 "He has been there, seen it and done it, at different clubs and with different players - plus he has played in it himself, which helps.
 "I like Steve as a person and I know him really well. He transfers his charisma onto the pitch and into the players.
 "He has got them (Hull) playing and isn't too afraid to experiment at times, with three at the back or the straight 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1.
 "What you can always say about Steve Bruce's team is that they are generally well organised and have a good energy about them and he gives them the freedom to play as well."

Dutchman Meulensteen replaced Martin Jol as boss in the midst of a six-game losing run in the Premier League, but hopes they can now put that behind them, having gotten back to winning ways.
 Goals from Steve Sidwell and Dimitar Berbatov secured the crucial victory that moved them level on points with Crystal Palace and West Brom in the lower regions of the Premier League table.
 Muelensteen hopes the three points will give them the boost in confidence lift they need to continue to climb up the table.
 "Good performances build confidence, good results build confidence and the team is in very good spirits," he said ahead of their trip to Everton on Sunday.
 "It's a process, which I've explained to the players. It's not something that's easy to turn on and off, but do the basic things right, build from there and hopefully more good results will come our way.
 "It's too early to say (if Fulham have turned a corner) but we made a good start."
 Meulensteen has been pleased with the way they have adapted to his style of coaching and expects further improvements to come.
 "The players have responded really well," he added. "What I've done is make sure we establish the basic ingredients for any performance which means that it's always based on work rate and commitment.
 "If that's not there, you can be the best players in the world but you won’t get any results. That's what I wanted to establish first.
 "My style, being Dutch, is based on good possession play, but with an attacking intent.
 "So hopefully, in time to come, I can blend that style into the Fulham team but, like I said, that's a process that takes a bit of time."

Serological testing \-- checking for antibodies -- is important because it identifies who has had the disease and helps to build a picture of how widespread the virus is, which can inform decisions about lifting distancing orders and allowing businesses to open.
 "This starts to get us to a point where we can start to make a difference in the population of our area and get people back to work and give them back the lives they were hoping for," Jerome said at a news conference Friday to discuss the antibody testing.
 At first, the lab will be able to process 3,000 to 4,000 tests a day. That number will increase to 12,000 to 14,000 tests per day once more equipment is moved to the lab from Harborview Medical Center, although it's unclear when that will be.
 Any health-care provider who thinks their patient should be tested for antibodies will be able to send in a sample of the patient's blood, Jerome said. It would make sense for health-care workers, first responders and anyone working near other people to have blood samples submitted, he said.
 The test isn't for people who currently have COVID-19 because it can take five to 14 days after symptoms appear for antibodies to develop, Jerome said.
 An advantage of moving quickly on antibody testing is that the virus is new and present so the antibodies flowing through people will be strong, said Dr. Alex Greninger, the lab's assistant director, who joined Jerome at the Friday news conference.
 Several other Seattle-area labs have also started testing blood for antibodies to the novel coronavirus or are developing new approaches to testing.
 One of the major unknowns about the epidemic is its impact on children, who do not seem to get as sick as adults, said Jesse Bloom, a biochemist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. He has been working with Dr. Janet Englund, at Seattle Children’s hospital, to test kids’ blood and estimate what proportion might have been infected. They expect to release their results soon, he said Friday.
 In addition, Bloom is using a more sophisticated type of test than the one at UW to better understand immune response to the virus. In particular, he is measuring how well the antibodies work to actually neutralize the virus — a key indicator of the level of immunity conferred by infection.

 METAIRIE, La. (AP) \" An off-duty Louisiana police officer shot and wounded a 14-year-old boy after he found several people in his front yard early Friday morning, authorities said.
 Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said the boy was hospitalized in critical condition Friday afternoon, news outlets reported.
 Lopinto said the officer was asleep when he heard noises outside his home around 3 a.m. Friday in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie. The man went outside and saw several juveniles in his front yard, near his vehicle, authorities said.
 An altercation occurred and the man shot the 14-year-old in the head, Lopinto said. The other individuals fled the scene but were later identified and interviewed, Lopinto said.
 The man and boy were not immediately identified. Lopinto also didn't specify which agency the man works for but said he was not a Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office deputy.
 Lopinto declined to state whether the officer would be arrested on any charges.

Another $3 billion will be used to purchase produce, dairy and meat and distribute the products to people in need.

 Perdue said about half of people’s calories in normal times are consumed outside the home. With people being urged or forced to stay home because of the pandemic, the food chain has faced major disruption. He used recent cases of dairy farmers being forced to dump milk that usually would be bound for food service as an example. Under the $3 billion purchase program, products that usually would go into food service will be redirected, thus helping farmers, food processors and food service providers.

 Relationships have always been difficult, even before COVID-19 swept across the globe. They require work, compassion, empathy, the list goes on. But at the end of the day, the person you choose to be in one with can make it all worth it, and be there for you when you can't be for yourself. And although the world as we know it has been undoubtedly shifted into the unknown, these values still hold true. So, how have relationships been affected by this pandemic?

Other local researchers are using those more sophisticated tests to screen plasma donated by people who have recovered from COVID-19. The plasma is being used to treat critically ill patients, but screening might be able to identify donors with the most potent plasma and boost the treatment’s effectiveness.
 Larry Corey, a virologist and former director of the Hutch, is working on an alternative approach to testing that might be quicker and more effective.
 After the first wave of the epidemic passes, Corey said, the only way to find out what percentage of the populace has been infected is through a blood test to detect antibodies to the virus.
 "Where this will plateau, I don’t know," Corey said. "What’s going to be the basal level of activity of COVID-19? For that, we need a serological tool."
 If only a small fraction have been infected, that means the majority remains susceptible to the virus and a relapse outbreak is possible.
 Corey and several of his colleagues at the Hutch are also working on new blood tests, which they hope will be ready within the next couple of weeks.
 Greninger and Jerome are pleased with early results from the antibody tests performed at UW Medicine's Virology Lab. They were able to test samples the lab already had on hand, including 300 samples taken last fall, before the virus began infecting humans. None of those tests turned up positive results.
 "We not seeing any false positives with this test," Jerome said.
 Robust antibody testing will help researchers figure out how long and how well antibodies protect against the virus. Antibodies from other coronaviruses can last a year or two, sometimes three, Jerome said.
 "To what degree that protection happens is something that the entire medical field is trying to figure out now," Jerome said. "We can find the virus, and we can also find who had it and find these antibodies."
 Testing for the novel coronavirus has been hard to come by for some Washingtonians, in part because of a limited availability of testing materials. Those supply challenges shouldn't arise for the antibody test because it is a blood draw and the test is built on the same platform that's already used for AIDS and hepatitis C, Greninger said.

To ensure New York is prepared, Governor Cuomo should follow New Hampshire’s lead and declare now that COVID-19 is a valid reason to seek an absentee ballot in the November election.
 Cuomo already authorized, by executive order, expansion of the absentee balloting privilege in the June 23 primary election and special elections including the 27th Congressional District contest, alongside postponing those elections from April 28.
 Barring amendment of the state constitution, absentee balloting is the only alternative to live voting in New York, and every voter who requests a mail-in ballot must furnish a valid “excuse” for not being able to vote in person: absence from their home county on election day, illness or disability.
 The benefit of further extending absentee balloting now is twofold. First and foremost, it would assure New Yorkers that a Wisconsin-style election disaster is not on our horizon this fall. Second, it would (or should, at least) create demand and a reason for much-needed basic voter education.
 In “normal” election years, absentee ballots are but a fraction of all votes cast. The process is tightly regulated and unfamiliar to most of us.
 In the event pandemic-related social restrictions are still in place in mid June, how many would-be primary and special election voters will be caught off guard?
 Perish the thought that's the case again in November.

 The city government as prepared about 500 rooms at hotels for those who are no longer able to stay at the net cafes, and more are being readied if needs grow, city official Kazuo Hatananaka said.

Rosselli believes he's getting a piece that will fit in nicely with the program he's trying to build.
 "We started, not from scratch at OU, but we're basically rebuilding the whole thing. We're putting in the right foundation, and as we continue to keep building and getting the pedigree where we want it, each year we get some recruits that are really, really good.
 "He's at a weight class that we need (149/157). He's a standout, has a couple hundred wins, has wrestled at a national level. He's got all the tools you need in a technical aspect. ... He knows how to win, and like I've said, he's tough, gritty, can handle the school work, and that's what you need."
 The transition won't be easy. Moving from the Niagara Frontier League to the Big 12 is a huge step up, and the first few months could leave a few lumps on a wrestler who hasn't taken many during his high school career.
 McDougald is eager to get started.
 "I'm really excited for the next level, man," he said. "I'm ready to get better and really make my name.
 "The biggest difference for me is wrestling grown men from kids from high school. The technique level is definitely going to be a lot different. I definitely know the first month or two I'm going to be whooped up a little bit, but it won't be too long before I'm competing with most."
 If he can get through that point, the wrestling world could be at McDougald's fingertips.
 "The signing, it's very exciting for the opportunity that it creates, but from the moment he signs that paper, it's a lifestyle change," Giancola said. "Division I wrestling is a lifestyle. You're a student and then you're a wrestler.
 "It's an exciting day, but the future requires a lot of commitment. I'm excited to see what he does with that opportunity."

Pochettino's men had started the Premier League game in a positive manner at the St Mary's Stadium, with Adam Lallana's well-placed shot beating Hugo Lloris to give Southampton a 13th-minute lead.
 Emmanuel Adebayor stretched to reach Roberto Soldado's cross and level proceedings 10 minutes before half-time before a goal glut after the break. An own goal from Jos Hooiveld and Adebayor's curled left-foot effort sandwiched Rickie Lambert's tap-in, with all three goals coming in the space of 10 second-half minutes.
 Pochettino praised the manner in which Southampton performed in the opening exchanges, but conceded it was difficult to stay in the game once Tottenham had found an equaliser through Adebayor.
 "(It was) very frustrating, I am very angry about the result," he said. "We actually dressed up as Santa Claus and gifted them so many chances.
 "We started very well in the first half, we went ahead 1-0 and nearly got the second goal.
 "But then we conceded the equaliser, it was hard to get back into the game especially in the second half."
 Lallana was a bright spark for Southampton, scoring the team's first and laying on the second for Lambert.
 And Pochettino thought the England international was unlucky to finish on the losing side.
 He added: "I would change Lallana's great performance for a positive result. It would be nice to have the positive result to go with his impressive performance.
 "When you talk about individual performances, it's great he played well and all credit to him but it's overshadowed by the fact we weren't able to get a win."
 The defeat means Southampton have won only one of their last eight Premier League fixtures and sit ninth ahead of Thursday's visit to Cardiff City.

Moyes' men go into Tuesday's UEFA Champions League visit of Shakhtar Donetsk on the back of consecutive home Premier League defeats against Everton and Newcastle United.
 United are yet to taste defeat in the Champions League this season and have already qualified for the last 16, but sit ninth in the Premier League, some 13 points adrift of leaders Arsenal.
 Former Everton boss Moyes refused to shirk the blame for those setbacks, and is eager to get the English champions back on track.
 "(Losing to Newcastle) raised my spirits," Moyes said. "(The result) made me more determined.
 "I take complete responsibility for the results. They've been good in the Champions League but not so good in the Premier League. I would like them to be much better, and I've got no doubt they will.
 "It is tough because we expect to win all the games. We have been inconsistent at times and we have played very well in some of the games in the Champions League, not so well in the Premier League, albeit we have lacked a little bit of good fortune at times.
 "I think there is a bit of everything that could with better, we'd like to pass it better, we'd like to create more chances, we'd like to defend better when those situations arise, it's all round we'd like to improve. It's only a few weeks ago we were talking very well about the team."
 The three-time Champions League winners can top Group A if they avoid defeat against the Ukrainian champions, a scenario that would likely hand them a less difficult tie in the first knockout round.
 "It's important to give ourselves the best possible chance we have in the next round," Moyes added.
 "But the big job was to make sure we qualify for the group, that part is done, but hopefully we can finish the group unbeaten. And if we do that then that will see us through."

METAIRIE, La. (AP) " An off-duty Louisiana police officer shot and wounded a 14-year-old boy after he found several people in his front yard early Friday morning, authorities said.
 Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said the boy was hospitalized in critical condition Friday afternoon, news outlets reported.
 Lopinto said the officer was asleep when he heard noises outside his home around 3 a.m. Friday in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie. The man went outside and saw several juveniles in his front yard, near his vehicle, authorities said.
 An altercation occurred and the man shot the 14-year-old in the head, Lopinto said. The other individuals fled the scene but were later identified and interviewed, Lopinto said.
 The man and boy were not immediately identified. Lopinto also didn't specify which agency the man works for but said he was not a Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office deputy.
 Lopinto declined to state whether the officer would be arrested on any charges.
 'We're treating him as a victim and a suspect,' Lopinto said.

The 45-year-old took charge of the country's successful intercontinental play- off qualifier against New Zealand - a 9-3 aggregate victory - after becoming the national team's fourth coach since September.
 But the Club America coach, who was settled upon at a Mexican Football Federation meeting on Monday, will now lead Mexico in Brazil next year, with officials looking to regain a degree of consistency following a period of uncertainty.
 "In the meeting, the proposal was put forward for Miguel Herrera as national team coach with the appointment of Ricardo Pelaez as sporting director," said national team general manager Hector Gonzalez Inarritu.
 While refusing to be drawn on the length of Herrera's contract, Inarritu insisted the intention is for the new coach to be in charge beyond next year's tournament.
 "Yes indeed, that's the plan," he continued. "The first official step obviously would be the World Cup and the continuity of the coaching staff and the sporting director.
 "Here, contracts are fully open, there is no expiration date."
 Herrera will assume permanent control of the national team after concluding his duties with Club America later this month, with the reigning Clausura champions set to face Toluca in the Liga MX Apertura semi-finals.

The Southampton coach witnessed his team have two penalty appeals waved away by referee Mark Clattenburg during their 2-1 defeat at Everton on Sunday.
 Pochettino said that while he has respect for officials, he has been left "angered" by decisions he feels have gone against his side.
 "These things need to be said and I am actually defending my club because it is my club and I think if I don't talk I am going to seem as if I am dumb or I don't care about my club," the Argentinian stated.
 "I don't mean any disrespect against any referees but anyone that could have seen the game on Sunday can see there were two clear penalties that weren't given and should have been given.
 "That would have changed the game completely but they weren't given and of course we are angry and upset about that.
 "I am saying things that should not be forgotten in the overall analysis of the game and they need to be said.
 "I don't mean any disrespect to anyone but there were two clear penalties that weren't given and that's very frustrating."
 Pochettino believes high-profile clubs are often awarded key decisions, adding: "That is the case and it shouldn't be that way. They shouldn't be conditioned to referee in that manner but that is the way it is."

"Don't pass the buck without passing the bucks," he said.
 At the same time, Cuomo acknowledged the public has grown weary of the extended shutdown.
 "The situation we’re in now is unsustainable," he said. "People can’t stay in their homes for this length of time. They can’t stay out of work."
 A key reason why the hospitalization rate has leveled off, he suggested it, is that the current infection rate — the number of times a virus-positive person infects someone else — has been reduced to 0.9 percent in New York, down from 1.2%, which is the level for an epidemic.
 If the state reopens businesses too swiftly, he said, the infection rate could jump again and "we'll be right back to where we started," he said.
 He suggested he is also listening to people from the North Country who have no interest in having to contend with a chain reaction, with downstate residents flocking to their region.
 "You open your beaches, but I don’t open my beaches," the governor said. "My people are all going to go to your beach. I get a lot of calls from people in the Adirondacks. They don’t want a lot of people coming from downstate to the Adirondacks and flooding their communities now."
 Meanwhile, with Cuomo signaling that the outbreak has eased somewhat, a coalition of upstate hospitals is asking the governor to amend his executive orders to allow them to resume elective surgeries at their facilities. More than 2,700 health care workers at upstate hospitals have been furloughed from their jobs, with the cancellation of those procedures being a significant factor.
 But Cuomo did not directly addressed the issue of the elective surgeries when he was asked about it at his daily press briefing. He has previously directed that all hospitals expand their bed capacity by 50% to brace for wave of admissions from virus infections.
 NURSING HOMES
 Faced with a wave of deaths at state-regulated nursing homes, the Cuomo administration, after rejecting press requests for information about the location of the facilities, began identifying the homes that have experienced at least five COVID-19 deaths.
 One home in Brooklyn, Cobble Hill, has had 55 deaths since the outbreak began last month. In all, more than 350 homes have reported patient fatalities.
 As of Friday, the state said 2,690 nursing home patients have died from the virus while an additional 626 residents of adult care facilities, also licensed by the state, have succumbed to the contagion.
 However, the tally does not include patients who died at hospitals after being transferred from the homes where they were infected.
 Last month, the state granted legal immunity to nursing home operators along with other health care providers, including doctors, for the way they addressed the contagion. The immunity has prompted patient advocates to question the lack of accountability.
 Richard J. Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said the state's move to provide more data on the fatalities was "a step in the right direction," though the continued block on the identities of scores of homes that have had deaths "just hides information further."
 Relatives of patients and the patients themselves, Mollot said, should have "all the information they need to survive and make good decisions."

Barca lost two games in a row for just the third time in the last four years on Sunday, as Iker Muniain's goal gave Bilbao a famous 1-0 triumph.
 They entered that fixture on the back of a 2-1 UEFA Champions League loss to Ajax and have stars Lionel Messi (thigh), Victor Valdes and Dani Alves (both calf) and Jordi Alba (hamstring) out injured.
 Pique is confident the Catalan giants will respond quickly to their defeats, though.
 "The second defeat was very different to the one in Amsterdam," he said.
 "Everyone has an opinion, but at San Mames we only conceded the one attempt on goal, which ended up in the net.
 "There was a refereeing decision that hurt us. Everything has been mixed in with Ajax. We are not so bad. The sensations from Bilbao were very good.
 "Either we can let ourselves sink further or we pick ourselves up. We are playing better, but we are not yet growing in confidence.
 "We did not have the desired reaction in Bilbao and on that we must do better. We have ups and downs, like the game in Amsterdam, which was unacceptable."
 Barca have an ideal chance to bounce back on Friday when they travel to third- tier Cartagena in the Copa del Rey, an assignment Pique is looking forward to.
 "We must demonstrate that we are not in a depression, that we are ready to start winning again," he added.
 "The Copa del Rey match on Friday will be a good opportunity for us to play a good game and regain our confidence."

Like the rest of California, restaurants and taverns are temporarily closed here, as are many nonessential businesses, such as tattoo and massage parlors. The county has also ordered all campgrounds, RV parks and hotels to either close down or shut their doors to guests _ unless those visitors plan to stay for 30 days.
 The thousands of California sea lions congregating around the city’s harbor and picturesque lighthouse don’t seem to mind the shutdown. Their chatter and barks can be heard throughout the downtown area all day and through the night.
 So far, the restrictions on businesses seem to have worked, said Apperson.
 “People get upset when they see out-of-state license plates, like, from Oregon, driving around here,” he said. “They trust one another in this community to do the right thing. But it’s the people who come from outside. That’s a different story.”
 At the same time, he’s concerned about government overreach, and the definition of what makes a business essential versus nonessential.
 While gun stores have been shuttered in cities such as Los Angeles, Pasadena and San Jose, Apperson and others see them as vital to maintaining calm and a sense of well-being in the region.
 “Lots of us hunt, here,” said Leslee Cates, who is waiting from the state to get final approval to sell guns. She is the owner of PRO2Arms, which is currently based out of her house on the outskirts of town.
 “Most people who live here are familiar with guns. We see them as essential: for hunting game and for protecting ourselves and our homes,” she said. “The problem is when people who aren’t familiar with them start buying them in a panic. But, that’s not the case here.”
 Down at the docks, people are also concerned the government could restrict their right to fish recreationally.
 Pandemonium transpired on a recent teleconference call with state fishery regulators, who were discussing the possibility of a coronavirus-spurred limited ban on sportfishing.
 “That was craziness,” said Chris Hegles, the manager of Crescent City’s Englund Marine, who was on the call. He said people were concerned the government was going to prohibit them from getting on their own boats and heading out to the ocean.
 Signs around the marina urge boaters to go out on the water only with immediate family members.
 And for now, everybody seems to be respecting the public health orders. But Apperson worries that if people feel their way of life is being taken away, that could be a problem.
 “I think we’ve responded well and the precautions we have taken are necessary,” he said. “But if you start doing things that go against the data that we have, well, I’m not sure that’s a good thing.”

Mihajlovic selected a largely second-tier team in Sampdoria's 4-1 win over Verona on Thursday as the Genoa-based club qualified for the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia.
 Midfielders Bjarnason and Renan both scored, as did striker Gianluca Sansone, while the likes of defender Simon Poulsen and midfielder Enzo Maresca made rare starts.
 Mihajlovic says he will have to think twice ahead of Sampdoria's clash with Catania on Sunday when he sits down to pick his team.
 "We are on the right track (and) my applause to all the boys," the 44-year-old coach said.
 "We must go on. We deserved to win and all the guys showed (commitment) and desire to do so.
 "They put me in trouble for future choices."
 For Renan, it was the Brazilian's second goal in as many games after he came off the bench to score the equaliser in Sampdoria's 1-1 draw away to Inter last week but Mihajlovic insisted the 27-year-old is far from the finished article.
 "(Renan) needs to improve a lot and we're working on that," Mihajlovic said.
 "I want midfielders who are not afraid to play and (take) two touches."
 Sampdoria took control of the Coppa Italia clash early with Sansone and Bjarnason both scoring in the opening 20 minutes.
 While Verona hit back after the hour-mark through Samuele Longo, Mihajlovic was thrilled with the way his side responded as substitute Nenad Krsticic and Renan struck in the final 10 minutes.
 "I always want to see this spirit," the Serb said.
 "Those who do not will have problems with me but I do not think (that) will happen."

LOGUMKLOSTER, Denmark — The cluster of red brick buildings in a remote part of southern Denmark looks unremarkable from the outside, but this week, its classrooms housed some of the rarest people during the pandemic in today’s Europe.
 Schoolchildren.
 On Wednesday, 350 pupils returned to classes at the Logumkloster District School for the first time in a month as Denmark became the first country in the Western world to reopen its elementary schools since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. It has turned the Danish education system into a laboratory for whether and how schools can function in an age of contagion.
 “It is a new world,” Tanja Linnet, the school’s head teacher, said as pupils arrived early Thursday. “We used to make plans for if there was a terrorist attack here — but never this kind of attack.”
 Other European countries have also gently eased restrictions on certain businesses and sporting activities in recent days.
 But by allowing hundreds of children to congregate once again at thousands of schools across Denmark, the government has taken the boldest step toward something resembling normal life, in a measure that will be watched carefully around the world.
 “That’s the dilemma of the whole world,” said Finn Christensen, the school’s deputy head. “When to open up?”

Hand-washing has become a part of the school routine — the first stop for all pupils at the start of every day and then on the hour thereafter. Tea ladies have the new task of touring the school with disinfectant, cleaning each door handle at least twice during school hours.
 These changes have been guided by the government, but the government’s instructions have sometimes changed on an hourly basis.
