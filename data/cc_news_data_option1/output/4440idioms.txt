A matchup of the Miami Hurricanes and Texas Longhorns would put two storied college programs head-to-head. ESPN's Mark Schlabach is projecting they would meet. Both teams at one point this year were top-10 teams but losses dropped them down the pecking order. The Hurricanes are within the top 15, but the Longhorns find themselves on the outside looking in.

This is the essence of Judaism. We are always in a relationship with G‚Äëd even when we are in a psychological dungeon (like during COVID or any other time). There is a bucket of waste around us, but we are empowered to live and love fully in the way G‚Äëd is asking of us in that specific situation. Our connection is able to grow with the tools He gives us at any time and place, even if sometimes we have to dig deep and be creative because it‚Äôs not the way we‚Äôve done things in the past.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply saddened these two girls can‚Äôt take that final step and compete in the state tournament in a season that really started at the beginning of the summer,‚Äù said Somerset girls tennis head coach John Harris.
 Somerset‚Äôs boys and girls cross country runners also had to withdraw from the District 5-8 Class AA sub-regional meet, which was scheduled to be held on Saturday at the Golden Eagles‚Äô home course.
 The meet was still held, but was moved to the Bedford County Technical Center in Everett.
 The Somerset football team, after already moving its game back a day because of the virus, had its regular season contest against Central Cambria on Saturday night canceled.
 ‚ÄúWe knew coming into the season that it was going to be day by day,‚Äù Golden Eagles first-year head football coach Brian Basile said. ‚ÄúWe always stress to our players that their health and safety is number one. No win or loss is worth that.‚Äù
 Fortunately for Basile and his team, their season is not yet finished.
 The Golden Eagles will be unable to play this week, due to not being able to have the mandatory three days of practice prior to a game. According to Close, Somerset is trying to find an opponent to play on Nov. 9, before finishing its season with a game on Nov. 13.
 ‚ÄúWe kicked around playing Southern Huntingdon on that Monday, we know they‚Äôre looking for a game, too,‚Äù Basile said. ‚ÄúWe still want to play as many games as we can, especially for our seniors. We‚Äôre trying to get everyone to stay positive, and hopefully this will all resolve itself soon.‚Äù

One week we sat down to learn Chayei Sarah, _Sarah‚Äôs Life._ This portion ( _parshah_ ) starts with Sarah‚Äôs death. Here we learn that the news of her beloved son, Isaac, and his imminent sacrifice caused Sarah to have a heart attack and die. She didn‚Äôt live to hear the end of the sentence. She never got to hear the part about the ram, which happened to appear in the bushes, being sacrificed instead of her son. It was one more lesson in how to choose words carefully, and the timing of their delivery with utmost care.

Since each Torah portion shows up once a year, we read the text differently according to our life circumstances. This year, I may obsess over Isaac‚Äôs mysterious surrender to the knife.

SAO PAULO ‚Äî Peque√±os grupos de manifestantes se reunieron el domingo en las dos ciudades m√°s grandes de Brasil para expresar su oposici√≥n a cualquier orden de vacunarse contra el coronavirus, respaldando una campa√±a de rechazo que encabeza el presidente Jair Bolsonaro.
 Las personas se congregaron en el centro de Sao Paulo con el fin de exigir la salida del gobernador del estado del mismo nombre, Joao Doria, quien ha dicho que se requerir√° que quienes viven all√≠ reciban una vacuna como la que est√°n desarrollando la compa√±√≠a biofarmace√∫tica china Sinovac y el Instituto Butantan de Brasil.
 ‚Äú¬°Coria caer√°!‚Äù, gritaron los inconformes. ‚Äú¬°Fuera Doria!‚Äù
 Bolsonaro y otras personas se han mostrado esc√©pticos ante la llamada CoronaVac, y el presidente ha dicho que los brasile√±os no ser√°n conejillos de indias de los cient√≠ficos chinos. El asunto se ha convertido en tema de debate en las campa√±as de las elecciones a alcald√≠as y consejos ciudadanos de finales de este mes. Aunque la mayor√≠a de los profesionales de salud respaldan la vacunaci√≥n, algunas campa√±as en las redes sociales han planteado interrogantes sobre posibles riesgos de las vacunas.
 Tambi√©n hubo manifestaciones en favor de Bolsonaro en la playa Copacabana de R√≠o de Janeiro.
 Un sondeo de PoderData revel√≥ esta semana que el porcentaje de brasile√±os que se expresaron a favor de vacunarse cay√≥ a 63% en octubre respecto a 85% cuatro meses antes. El porcentaje de aquellos que rechazan la idea de vacunarse aument√≥ a 22% respecto a tan s√≥lo el 8% en julio.
 La Fundaci√≥n Getulio Vargas, un centro de investigaci√≥n, se√±al√≥ que un an√°lisis de 2 millones de publicaciones en Twitter revel√≥ que 24% de los perfiles identificados como simpatizantes de Bolsonaro fueron responsables del 56% de las menciones en contra de la vacuna. Del otro lado, el 47% de los perfiles identificados como promotores de la vacunaci√≥n representaron el 32% de las publicaciones.
 Doria dijo en octubre que la vacunaci√≥n ser√≠a obligatoria en su estado, y el ministro de Salud de Bolsonaro, Eduardo Pazuello, anunci√≥ que el pa√≠s hab√≠a accedido a adquirir dosis de CoronaVac fabricadas en el pa√≠s.
 El presidente no tard√≥ en responder que no permitir√≠a la importaci√≥n de vacunas de China. A pesar de que poco despu√©s los reguladores de salud otorgaron permiso a Butantan para importar 6 millones de dosis, Bolsonaro dijo el jueves durante su programa en vivo que no adquirir√≠a la vacuna y que el gobernador ‚Äúdeber√° encontrar a alguien m√°s para que le compre su vacuna‚Äù.
 Por su parte, el vicepresidente Hamilton Mourao declar√≥ el viernes a la revisa Veja que el pa√≠s ‚Äúdesde luego‚Äù comprar√° la vacuna de Butantan-Sinovac. Bolsonaro respondi√≥ de inmediato que es √©l quien est√° en el poder y no gastar√° en ninguna vacuna que no sea aprobada por los reguladores de salud de Brasil.
 El pa√≠s ha reportado m√°s de 5.5 millones de infecciones confirmadas de coronavirus, y unas 160,000 personas han muerto a causa de la enfermedad. A pesar de que la propagaci√≥n del virus ha comenzado a desacelerarse, expertos en salud p√∫blica piden a la poblaci√≥n que no baje la guardia.
 Los profesionales de salud tambi√©n han alzado la voz en un intento por obtener apoyo para las vacunas.
 ‚ÄúLa vacunaci√≥n en masa con alta cobertura ser√≠a el √∫nico mecanismo que tenemos para controlar la epidemia, al menos a mediano plazo‚Äù, dijo Jesem Orellana, investigador epidemiol√≥gico en la Fundaci√≥n Oswaldo Cruz, un instituto de investigaci√≥n cient√≠fica. ‚ÄúEn los √∫ltimos ocho meses hemos fracasado con medidas no farmac√©uticas‚Äù.
 El doctor Paulo A Lotufo, epidemi√≥logo de la Universidad de Sao Paulo, dijo que los programas nacionales de inmunizaci√≥n han sido bien recibidos por el p√∫blico brasile√±o, que ha visto el impacto positivo de las vacunas, incluyendo aquellas contra la meningitis y la polio.
 ‚ÄúLa poblaci√≥n se vacunar√°‚Äù, pronostic√≥ Lotufo en una entrevista v√≠a Skype. ‚ÄúM√°s del 90% de la poblaci√≥n se vacunar√°‚Äù.

Handing out grades from the Texas Longhorns-Oklahoma State game on Saturday

WASHINGTON -- After a year of deep disruption, America is poised for a presidential election that renders a verdict on the nation's role in the world and the direction of its economy, on its willingness to contain an escalating pandemic and its ability to confront systemic racial inequity.
 But the two men on the ballot, President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, offer more than just differing solutions for the country's most pressing problems. The choice before voters is a referendum on the role of the presidency itself and a test of the sturdiness of democracy, with the president challenging the legitimacy of the outcome even before Election Day and law enforcement agencies braced for the possibility of civil unrest.
 "There's more than just your standard ideological difference between the two candidates. There's a fundamentally different view of what the presidency is and what leadership means for the nation," said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University.
 Voters appear to recognize the moment: More than 86 million people have already cast ballots, shattering records for early voting.
 A Trump victory would deepen the anti-establishment, inward-facing approach to the nation's challenges that he has ushered in over the past four years -- an approach enthusiastically embraced by the president's supporters and loathed by his critics. The courts, which have been stacked with a generation of conservative jurists during Trump's tenure, would veer further to the right.
 Victory for Biden would be as much a repudiation of the incumbent as it would be a win for the longtime Democratic politician, a former vice president and senator. Though Biden has outlined an agenda that envisions a more robust role for the federal government in American life and a more aggressive effort to combat the pandemic, the core of his campaign centered on him being a temperamental contrast to Trump.
 Control of the Senate is also at stake. Competitive races from Maine to Arizona give Democrats a chance to retake the majority from Republicans. Democrats are expected to easily maintain their grip on the House.
 Bitter partisanship
 The election is being held at a moment of bitter partisanship in America, and whichever candidate wins the White House will confront the challenge of governing through deep divisions. If anything, the campaign has clarified how stratified the United States has become, with Trump's base of support coming from overwhelmingly white voters at lower income and education levels. More highly educated Americans, particularly women and voters of color, most notably African Americans, have all but abandoned the Republican Party during Trump's four years in office.
 Trump faced a particularly fierce outcry from Black Americans after his response to the largely peaceful protests that erupted across the country this summer over racial injustice in policing. The president highlighted the sporadic outbursts of violence and argued that white, suburban neighborhoods would be overrun by mayhem if Biden were elected.
 Biden has condemned Trump as racist. Biden also has made explicit appeals to Republicans, seeking to draw support from those who may have taken a chance on Trump but have been turned off by his divisiveness and fierce personal attacks on his critics.
 The Democratic nominee has proved to be an alluring alternative to some of those voters, given his more moderate record and campaign agenda, and his more traditional approach to foreign policy, including U.S engagement in the kinds of multilateral institutions such as NATO that Trump has flirted with abandoning.
 Dan Giesen, 56, of Minneapolis, said he was a conservative voter before Trump became the Republican nominee four years ago, leading him to vote for third- party candidate Evan McMullin. Last week, Giesen was waiting in line to cast his vote early for Biden.
 "I think we can deal with partisan differences when our institutions and our norms are in place, but I think that those are being seriously eroded under Donald Trump," he said.
 Biden's edge
 Biden heads into Tuesday's election with an edge in public polling, including a comfortable national lead and a narrower advantage in some of the battleground states that will decide the contest. He has multiple paths to victory and has devoted significant resources to the Upper Midwest states where Trump surprised Democrats four years ago, but also to states such as Arizona and Georgia that for years have been reliable Republican territory.
 Though Democrats are wary of overconfidence, given Trump's upset in 2016, party leaders see significant differences in this year's election. Biden is viewed more favorably by voters than Hillary Clinton was four years ago. And the pandemic, which has upended nearly every aspect of American life, saddled Trump with overwhelmingly negative reviews from voters on his handling of the crisis.
 "In the last 10 days of 2016, the story was, 'What's the FBI going to do about the newly reopened Hillary Clinton email investigation?'" said Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who was Clinton's running mate in 2016. Now, Kaine said, "they're talking about COVID and how it's affecting communities."
 The pandemic indeed turned Trump's plans for this election year inside out.
 The president opened 2020 in strong position, with a robust economic record and the GOP unified behind him after he survived an impeachment trial centered on his request for Ukraine's help digging up dirt on Biden.
 Since then, the coronavirus has gripped the nation, causing nearly 230,000 deaths and infecting more than 9 million Americans; both are the highest confirmed counts in the world. The U.S. economy cratered, and though it has recovered somewhat, the unemployment rate rests at 7.9% and businesses across the country are worried about surviving the winter, given that infection rates are on the rise.
 Trump himself contracted the virus in October and was briefly hospitalized. Since then, he's been barnstorming the country, holding large rallies with crowds that are not socially distanced and only sporadically wearing masks. His message to Americans has been that the United States is "rounding the corner" on the virus, despite the fact that cases are on the rise in most states and the United States is setting daily records for confirmed cases.
 Sixty-five percent of Americans said the president has not taking the pandemic seriously enough, according to a mid-October poll from The Associated Press- NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
 Trump's strategy
 Despite the pandemic's toll on his political fortunes, Trump's campaign is banking on strategy similar to 2016. Advisers contend that Trump will draw out new voters who haven't participated in politics previously or in some time. His campaign is also banking on some voters ultimately looking beyond their personal qualms with the president to back his policies.
 That was the case for Tom Redford, 79, who cast his ballot for Trump on Thursday outside of Richmond, Virginia. Redford said he's the only Trump supporter in his family and doesn't much like the president personally.
 "But everything he's done is great -- everything, including what he's done on the coronavirus," Redford said as he waited in a line of more than 200 people.
 The president's pathway to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the White House is narrow. He needs to hold onto Florida, a perennial battleground, as well as nearly all of the territory he carried in 2016. He's spent the final days of the campaign on defense, making stops in states such as Georgia and Iowa, where he won comfortably four years ago.
 The challenge for Trump is engineering a late shift in the race when so many voters have already cast ballots. By Saturday, the early vote tally represented more than 60% of all the votes cast in the 2016 race.
 Associated Press writers Mohamed Ibrahim in Minneapolis and Denise Lavoie in Richmond, Virginia, contributed to this report.

Years ago, a few friends and I headed to New York City for a day of bonding and recreation. We drove to the station, parked, hopped on a train to the city, and spent an enjoyable day visiting museums and taking in the sights. Since we bought all the tickets in advance, I had no need to take out my wallet during the trip. But when I stepped off the train at the end of the day on our way home, I suddenly realized it was missing.

 Call me Captain Obvious, I'll say it anyway. Successful businesses existed long before social media. So, is it me? Or have you noticed people seem brainwashed into thinking social media is the only place to get paying customers?
 From the grand scheme, social media is a drop in the ocean. Sour grapes? No. You'll see why it puts a business at risk and without precautions, how social media can kill a business. Keep control of your business and access to customers. It's your success.
 1\. Think about the millions of businesses over the decades who've been successful without social media. Right? And by their own admission, social media companies use neuroscience intentionally to addict users maybe even brainwash them into believing social media is the only way to achieve success. Huh? That's like saying the only place you can get oxygen is at Busch Gardens. Oxygen is everywhere.
 Thinking social media is solely responsible for business success is a disconnect. Success starts in your mind and with a kick-ass product. Agree. Lead generation and being in front of potential customers can net sales. But there are countless ways to secure new customers. Should social media disappear tomorrow, would you still have a successful business? Sure. Customers must know about your product in order to buy it. And developing a superior product still works. The market always speaks. If the product is good, people will buy it, in a store, via word of mouth, from a sales force, a distribution channel or on an e-commerce website, without social media.
 2\. If you have a direct relationship with your customers and a proprietary house list, you own it. No one can take it from you. If your business is 100% reliant upon social media for customers and your revenue, consider this. The big tech monopolists censor information. If unchecked, suppression could impact business. What Facebook giveth, Facebook taketh away. At any moment and without warning a social media behemoth can and has changed algorithms that can kill a business.
 So, what's the upside to outsourcing customer access to a third-party, where you have zero control? Instead, develop an effective growth strategy, where you retain control. Advertise on Facebook, LinkedIn or whatever. The precaution? Have a process to capture names and funnel them into your house list so your business isn't held hostage to a third party. Honestly, there's no substitute for an independent, direct customer relationship. Because paying customers are to business what oxygen is to lungs.
 Businesses came first. Who mandated that social media is required to succeed? Remember what oxygen and customers have in common. When anyone says the only place you can get oxygen is at Busch Gardens. That negative twinge signals, not true. It's everywhere. When anyone suggests the only place you can get customers is social media. Not true. They're everywhere. Brainwashing? It's benevolent only when it says you control your own success.
