Despite the fact the second movie only just dropped on Netflix in July, the third instalment will be on its _way_ sooner than most imagined, as it has in fact already been filmed!
 Yup, savvy producers managed to shoot both the second and third films at the same time, which, considering production on almost every TV show and film was forced to halt for months during the COVID-19 pandemic, turned out to be a pretty good idea!
 So, a February 14th release date would be a seven month gap between instalments, which is considerably smaller than the two year gap between the first and second, but the appetite for these films amongst fans is HUGE!
 Plus, the whole film is basically made for the day, what with the love stories and let's not forget where it all began, with an actual kissing booth.
 TKB also announced it was getting a sequel on Valentine's Day in 2019... so, they're totally on board with this vibe!

The defence ministry on Tuesday gave its go-ahead for the purchase of military equipment worth Rs 8,722 crore, including 106 locally made basic trainer aircraft, for the Indian Air Force to provide a push to the government's Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' (self-reliant India movement), a defence ministry spokesperson said.
 Basic trainers figure on the government's negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years.
 The ministry's defence acquisition council (DAC) accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for buying 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.
 Under India's defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware.
 "With HAL having successfully developed HTT-40 prototypes and certification process underway, the DAC approved procurement of 106 basic trainers to address the training requirements of the IAF," the ministry said in a statement. The IAF is expected to order 70 trainers initially, with the remaining 36 to be bought after the operationalisation of the HTT-40 fleet in the IAF.
 This is the first step in a long journey ahead, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.
 "While it's a thumbs-up for the design and development of the HTT-40, HAL has to rise to the occasion now and produce them to a time schedule that the IAF wants. Work ethics would require a change to do that," Bahadur said.
 The HTT-40 aircraft has undergone a string of elaborate tests at HAL to demonstrate that it is safe for rookie pilots and meets the IAF's exacting standards for trainer planes. HAL could begin the production of the trainers by early next year.
 Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some amount of Stage 2 training is being done on the PC-7.
 The defence ministry in July 2019 suspended business dealings with Swiss plane maker Pilatus Aircraft Limited for one year for violation of a pre-contract integrity pact in a Rs 2,900-crore contract for 75 basic trainers, and also factoring in Indian investigations against the plane maker for alleged corruption and irregularities.
 The contract with Pilatus included a clause for follow-on purchase of 38 more planes.
 The DAC - India's apex procurement body - also cleared the purchase of an upgraded version of the super rapid gun mount (SRGM) which is fitted as the main gun onboard warships, to improve the navy's firepower, the statement said. This weapon will be supplied by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). "The upgraded version of SRGM has enhanced capability to perform against fast manoeuvring targets like missiles," the statement said.
 Other defence items cleared for purchase include tank ammunition - the 125 mm APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot). It will have 70% indigenous content. The statement said some of the other approvals given by the DAC will accelerate the purchase of AK-203 assault rifles and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) upgrades.
 India on Sunday announced that it will ban the import of 101 defence items over the next five years, a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector.
 These include artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines, long-range land attack cruise missiles, assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.

Republicans, however, can learn from Engel‚Äôs impending departure as HFAC chair and the race to replace him. The GOP, unlike the Democratic caucuses, adheres to rigid term limit rules for committee chairs and ranking members. In the House, the Republican conference‚Äôs rules limit ranking members and chairs of committees to a total of three two-year terms in these leadership positions. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans are confined to six years of service as ranking members and six years as chairs of the same committee. These limits represent neither the best nor only option to ensure legislative accountability and leadership turnover. And with the next Congress still five months away, Republican legislators in both the House and the Senate have ample time to draw lessons from Engel‚Äôs loss and translate them into reform.

 This November, Arizona voters will select three members to the five member Arizona Corporation Commission.

The commission has broad powers to regulate utility companies, securities, business incorporation‚Äôs and pipelines.
 Three Republicans and three Democrats are on the ballot. If the Republicans win, the commission will continue to be a ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù of the large utility companies. It will continue to resist efforts to use renewable energy sources.
 It will favor rate hikes for small utility customers and promote ‚Äúderegulation‚Äù policies favored by the companies it is supposed to regulate. The three Democratic candidates ‚Äî Bill Mundell, Shea Stanfield and Anna Tovar favor the use of renewable energy. Because they are not the beneficiary of large corporate donations, they will resist the efforts of the big utility companies to keep the commission a toothless regulator.

The defence ministry on Tuesday gave its go-ahead for the purchase of military equipment worth Rs 8,722 crore, including 106 locally made basic trainer aircraft, for the Indian Air Force to provide a push to the government's Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' (self-reliant India movement), a defence ministry spokesperson said.Basic trainers figure on the government's negative import list that seeks to ban the import of 101 different types of weapons, systems and ammunition over the next five years. The ministry's defence acquisition council (DAC) accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for buying 106 Hindustan Turbo Trainer-40 (HTT-40) aircraft from state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) at a meeting chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh.Under India's defence procurement rules, AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware."With HAL having successfully developed HTT-40 prototypes and certification process underway, the DAC approved procurement of 106 basic trainers to address the training requirements of the IAF," the ministry said in a statement. The IAF is expected to order 70 trainers initially, with the remaining 36 to be bought after the operationalisation of the HTT-40 fleet in the IAF.This is the first step in a long journey ahead, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. "While it's a thumbs-up for the design and development of the HTT-40, HAL has to rise to the occasion now and produce them to a time schedule that the IAF wants. Work ethics would require a change to do that," Bahadur said.The HTT-40 aircraft has undergone a string of elaborate tests at HAL to demonstrate that it is safe for rookie pilots and meets the IAF's exacting standards for trainer planes. HAL could begin the production of the trainers by early next year. Rookie pilots in IAF go through a three-stage training involving the Pilatus PC-7 MkII planes, Kiran trainers and finally the Hawk advanced jet trainers before they can fly fighter jets. As the Kirans are approaching the end of their service life, some amount of Stage 2 training is being done on the PC-7.The defence ministry in July 2019 suspended business dealings with Swiss plane maker Pilatus Aircraft Limited for one year for violation of a pre- contract integrity pact in a Rs 2,900-crore contract for 75 basic trainers, and also factoring in Indian investigations against the plane maker for alleged corruption and irregularities.The contract with Pilatus included a clause for follow-on purchase of 38 more planes. The DAC - India's apex procurement body - also cleared the purchase of an upgraded version of the super rapid gun mount (SRGM) which is fitted as the main gun onboard warships, to improve the navy's firepower, the statement said. This weapon will be supplied by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL). "The upgraded version of SRGM has enhanced capability to perform against fast manoeuvring targets like missiles," the statement said.Other defence items cleared for purchase include tank ammunition - the 125 mm APFSDS (Armour Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot). It will have 70% indigenous content. The statement said some of the other approvals given by the DAC will accelerate the purchase of AK-203 assault rifles and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) upgrades.India on Sunday announced that it will ban the import of 101 defence items over the next five years, a significant step on the long road towards achieving self-reliance in the defence sector.These include artillery guns, light military transport aircraft, conventional submarines, long-range land attack cruise missiles, assault rifles, sniper rifles, short-range surface-to-air missiles, beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, corvettes, missile destroyers, light combat helicopter, light combat aircraft, a variety of radars and different types of ammunition.

Seeing as both the second and third instalments were shot at the same time, we can't see any radically changing cast on the landscape, with Joey King (Elle Evans) and Jacob Elordi (Noah Flynn) keeping on their leading roles and Taylor Zakhar Perez settling into a more permanent role!
 Filming took place both in LA and Cape Town, South Africa, with such a far away location most likely playing a part in why bosses decided to shoot both films at the same time, for practicality!
 There was recently some mild drama between exes and co-stars Joey and Jacob, when the latter revealed in an interview with Variety he hadn't watched the second film.
 Joey took to Twitter to call out Jacob for 'lying' only to quickly delete the tweet, which left fans in a flurry trying to work out if there was beef between the stars.
 However, as the third film is already in the bag- there's no fear of a rift putting the franchise at risk, phew!

Price is the amount of money charged to a consumer - in this case a student - for a good or service. Cost is the amount of money the provider spends to produce that good or provide that service. Unlike in business, the price colleges charge - that is, tuition - is almost always less than the cost to provide instruction. The difference is covered by taxpayers and grants at public colleges and by endowment earnings, gifts and grants at private colleges.

The company says the Air will cost around $150,000 but has yet to announce final pricing. While Lucid plans to introduce more affordable models, it is focused for the time being on a high-end product that can outperform its peers. The strategy mirrors the approach Elon Musk took with the Tesla Roadster before moving downmarket to cheaper models such as the Model S and then the Model 3.‚ÄúYou are defined by your first product," Rawlinson tells me an interview. ‚ÄúWe need to create a technological tour de force as our first product at an appropriate price point. If we were at a lower price point, we wouldn‚Äôt get a margin on the product, largely because of the battery cost being such a significant factor in our bill of materials."
