All things being equal, it would not be inconceivable that a Democratic administration would support these same policies - but everything Trump does is divisive. For many Democrats, Trump‚Äôs embrace of Arab autocrats, such as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been understood as a shrewd strategy to further US interests, but rather as his embracing another autocrat - a fellow traveller in the world community who acts in open defiance of international legality.

The accident took place on Thursday.


  The service members were among a crew of 16 aboard an amphibious assault vehicle that had just completed a training exercise when it began taking on water about a half-mile from Navy-owned San Clemente Island, off of San Diego.


  The 26-ton, tank-like craft quickly sank in hundreds of feet of water ‚Äî too deep for divers ‚Äî making it difficult to reach.


  In addition to the eight missing service members, one Marine was reported dead and two others were injured.


  All of the Marines aboard were attached to the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, based at nearby Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego. They ranged in age from 19 to early 30s and all were wearing combat gear, including body armor and flotation vests, Lt. Gen. Joseph Osterman, commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, said earlier this week.


  The craft was one of 13 amphibious assault vehicles that participated in the routine exercise and was heading back to a Navy ship when the accident happened.


  Troops on board two other amphibious assault vehicles responded quickly but couldn‚Äôt stop the sinking, Osterman said.


  The vehicle, nicknamed an ‚Äúamtrac‚Äù -- short for ‚Äúamphibious tractor‚Äù -- was designed to be buoyant and had three water-tight hatches and two large troop hatches. The Marines use the vehicles to transport troops and their equipment from Navy ships to land.


  The vehicles have been used since 1972, and have been continually refurbished.


  On Friday, the Marine Corps commandant, Gen. David Berger, suspended waterborne operations of all of its more than 800 amphibious assault vehicles across the branch until the cause of the accident is determined. He said the move was out of ‚Äúan abundance of caution.‚Äù


  It was the deadliest of several accidents involving amtracs that have occurred during Camp Pendleton exercises in recent years.


  In 2017, 14 Marines and one Navy sailor were hospitalized after their vehicle hit a natural gas line at the camp, igniting a fire that engulfed the landing craft.


  And in 2011, a Marine died when an amphibious assault vehicle in a training exercise sank offshore of the camp.

Batman‚Äôs signature vehicle has existed in some form since the early 1940s, but no version of it is cooler than the Tumbler that debuted in Christopher Nolan‚Äôs ‚ÄúDark Knight‚Äù trilogy. Though it‚Äôs closer to a tank than a car, the Tumbler is capable of jumping across rooftops and has a stealth mode. And, in the unlikely event it‚Äôs destroyed, it can also turn into a motorcycle, because why not?

Because at the end of the day no matter how much we agree or don‚Äôt agree, self-accountability. The talent go out there and agree to do it. And if you don‚Äôt want to do it, don‚Äôt do it. That‚Äôs the chance you gotta take. You gotta be ready to die on that fucking hill. You gotta know when and where to do it too and you gotta know if you have the pull to pull it off and whatnot, you know?. That‚Äôs why I say I walked out on millions of dollars and said, ‚ÄòFuck you. Take me off your shitty TV show and I‚Äôm going home.‚Äô And I fucking left. I had my reasons in injuries and I knew there were a lot of things. But that‚Äôs what Booker is talking about ‚Äì that‚Äôs on you. It‚Äôs not about the Jeffreys and Karens on social media to get you a push.

This is the social media trend is everyone is pulling for you when you‚Äôre fucking not being used and the moment you‚Äôre being used, everyone, ‚ÄòYou fucking suck. You don‚Äôt deserve shit.‚Äô You know what I mean? That‚Äôs why you stay off of it and just fucking learn the game and it falls on you. At the end of the day, the talent agree to go out there and do whatever is asked of them. So it‚Äôs their fault. It was my fault, I agreed to go do it. I got paid accordingly to do whatever they wanted to pay me to go out and do those things. I didn‚Äôt agree with any of them. I tried at various points, at the end of the day I chose to go be a professional and do what is asked of me, but it‚Äôs my fault. Because I agreed to do it.

On the face of it, there seem to be a few cultural "rules." But with every rule, exceptions abound. The kitchen is one such distinction. Generally speaking, Chinese cooks value working over an open flame. Due to the frequent movement of woks and quick changes in heat, gas ranges are therefore strongly preferred over electric or induction stoves. But the popularity of high-end gas ranges in Wellesley kitchens, combined with my clients' requests, has shown me that the Chinese aren't the only ones who want to see real fire when they're making dinner for their families.

Interestingly, although the history of China dates back over 3,000 years, its people by and large have a strong preference for new buildings. Over the last few decades, China has gone through phases of rapid construction, and many Chinese have grown up in new high-rise developments. When looking for a home in the US, understanding the needs of an old home can be a daunting task for Chinese families.

‚ÄúI agree with Booker completely. Booker‚Äôs gonna state an opinion and I get it when you‚Äôre on the roster and on the inside and looking out at people giving their opinions. Nobody‚Äôs more frustrated than the people working for that company right now. I can guarantee you. At the end of the day though, the system‚Äôs always been fucking cutthroat. And Booker got over when Booker came to WWE after being in WCW. He went through a ton of bullshit. He played the game, he figured it out and he got himself opportunities to go out there and he fucking had just an amazing, amazing career and I love Booker T. He‚Äôs old school and he respects the business, but he‚Äôs a fucking badass that knows how to get the job done.

He knows all the bullshit in pro wrestling, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the talent to fucking figure it out.

If people started fucking hashtagging #GiveRybackAChance then I would say, ‚ÄòShut the fuck up.‚Äô That‚Äôs on me to go do it. That‚Äôs on me to figure out the game and I went through it at the highest level and got put through the fucking meat grinder up there after fucking already being over and improving it. I know where Booker‚Äôs coming from, he‚Äôs just saying it‚Äôs on Naomi. It‚Äôs up to her to go sit up there and figure out how to be put in that position.
