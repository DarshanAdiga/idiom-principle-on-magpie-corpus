“It is very obvious that this mass protest significantly by our youths across the country is not only about “End SARS” but is an expression of the peoples’ anger against bad governance, widespread corruption, unemployment, nepotism, cronyism, increasing cost of living, insecurity, poor infrastructure and lack of basic human necessity of food, housing and decent allowance.

Here are the DanvilleSanRamon.com editorial board's endorsements of candidates for State Assembly, State Senate and Congress positions representing the San Ramon Valley. We reached our decisions based on email interviews on endorsements, and our review of past reporting and other research.


  State Assembly


  State Assemblywoman Rebecca Bauer-Kahan (D-Orinda) is running for a second straight term representing the Tri-Valley and the rest of the 16th Assembly District.


  Bauer-Kahan has impressed in the nearly 22 months since she was sworn into elected office for the first time, with a range of legislative accomplishments in the State Assembly including bipartisan bills on gun safety, climate change and streamlining government processes as well as leading the first-ever Select Committee on Women's Reproductive Health.


  She has also represented Tri-Valley priorities well in Sacramento, including authoring a bill to better preserve Tesla Park southeast of Livermore and advocating in favor of local control amid the state housing policy debate.


  Facing her on the Nov. 3 ballot is Joe Rubay (R-Alamo), who sits on the Alamo Police Services Advisory Committee. He is prioritizing COVID-19 recovery, transportation, the environment and returning political balance to the State Capitol. But with Rubay lacking elected legislative experience, we needed to see a more detailed campaign platform including specific achievable policy proposals.


  Vote to re-elect Rebecca Bauer-Kahan to Assembly District 16.


  State Senate


  State Senator Steve Glazer (D-Orinda) is campaigning for a second full term after winning a special election in May 2015 as an Orinda councilman to fill the State Senate District 7 vacancy at the time.


  In the five-plus years since, Glazer has proven himself to be a worthy legislator who prioritizes the needs and desires of District 7 constituents, even if it means voting against the party line from time to time. He is exactly the sort of thoughtful, independent decision-maker that the Tri-Valley deserves.


  Glazer's track record of bipartisan legislative successes on topics like assault weapons, flavored tobacco and protecting small businesses speaks for itself, as do his key goals for the term ahead such as public education, the environment, advocating for local control and responsible budgeting.


  Opposing on the ballot is Julie Mobley, a Danville resident running for public office for the first time who advanced out of the March primary as the lone Republican candidate with next to no campaign. Mobley highlights important topics such as business and school reopenings, infrastructure, reducing fire risk and public safety, but she offers few actionable policy proposals and has no prior legislative experience. The State Senate should not be an entry-level political position, especially in 2020.


  Vote to re-elect Steve Glazer to Senate District 7.


  Congress


  U.S. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Concord), a longtime legislator with years of local and state elected service experience before joining Congress, is running for a fourth straight term representing the 11th Congressional District, which includes Alamo, Blackhawk, Diablo and most of Danville.


  First and foremost, we're happy to see DeSaulnier has made significant strides in his recovery from the serious bout of non-COVID pneumonia that nearly took his life earlier this year. He has returned to a full work schedule and remains the active, responsive congressman he's been for the previous six years.


  DeSaulnier has a long record of delivering results in and for Contra Costa County over the past three decades, which is why he's the right person to serve District 11 during the important two years ahead as the whole nation works to navigate through and rebound from the pandemic. He is wisely prioritizing COVID-19 relief for residents and businesses, protecting frontline workers and getting the economy back on track, while also having an eye toward transportation, the environment, racial justice, and safeguarding Medicare and Social Security.


  Opposing the incumbent is Republican political newcomer Nisha Sharma, a real estate professional who lives in Danville. She has a long list of topic areas that she aims to prioritize, but we remain unconvinced by the lack of specific detail in her campaign platform. A challenger needs to have -- and demonstrate -- a game plan for accomplishing their goals should they win, especially if they're someone who's never been elected to public office before.


  Vote to re-elect Mark DeSaulnier for District 11.


  U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore), a former Dublin city councilman and Alameda County prosecutor, is seeking a fifth consecutive term representing San Ramon, a small part of Danville and the rest of the 15th Congressional District.


  In these uncertain times, District 15 needs a representative with legislative experience, deep ties to the Tri-Valley and institutional knowledge with sincere, actionable policy goals aimed at improving residents' quality of life. Based on those important criteria, Swalwell stands alone in this contest.


  Like we wrote ahead of the primary in March, we hear the criticisms of certain readers lamenting Swalwell's rising profile in D.C. -- the notion that he's focused on his national image, TV appearances or party standing, rather than discernible accomplishments in and for the Tri-Valley. Or, maybe they're just projecting because they don't like his politics or vocal presence?


  Objectively, Swalwell is the only viable candidate on this ballot -- and a highly qualified one at that. His opponent, Alison Hayden (R-Hayward), who has never held elected legislative office, appears to be running a campaign focused on fear-mongering and untenable ideas that aren't rooted in federal policy.


  Vote to re-elect Eric Swalwell for District 15.

The authorities have recently ordered a magisterial inquiry under Section 176 of CrPC into the suspicious death of the Sopore youth Irfan Ahmad Dar who was in police custody before his body, according to police, was found in a stone quarry.


  An inquiry under Section 176 CrPC is held into custodial deaths or suicides by women within seven years of marriage or where the death of any woman raises reasonable suspicion about any person being behind the offence. An inquiry under this Section can be held by an executive or judicial magistrate.


  However, a special provision in the form of Section 176 (1)(A) was added to Section 176 CrPC in 2005, by way of amendment, which exclusively deals with custodial deaths or custodial rapes or disappearances. The inquiry under Section 176(1)(A) mandates probe by a judicial or metropolitan magistrate having local jurisdiction over the area where the offence is committed.


  The Sopore inquiry started off on the wrong foot in utter disregard to the special law dealing with custodial deaths and to the legislative intent – mandating judicial inquiry into custodial deaths. While the much out-dated executive investigation is underway, two cops from whose hands Irfan allegedly “escaped” have been suspended though the suspension of the cops only cements the police’s “escape-theory” and is not connected with the inquiry.


  Therefore, the reasons for Irfan’s death still stands contested between the police and the family and the probe doesn’t excite hopes of the family, given the chequered history of probes in Kashmir.


  Hundreds of probes have been ordered only to end up becoming food for bookworms. In Kashmir, probes suffer for want of just-conclusions and do not enthrall public confidence. The J&K Coalition of Civil Societies put out a shocking figure of ‘zero prosecution’ in about 108 probes ordered from 2008 to 2019.


  In the cases of custodial deaths, victims rarely get justice and police versions ultimately prevail, as in such cases only police officials know the exact circumstances of the death but they prefer shielding their colleagues as has been observed by the Apex court in State of MP vs. Shyamsunder Trivedi, in the following words, “ _…rarely in cases of police torture or custodial deaths, direct ocular evidence of the complicity of the police personnel would be available...Bound as they are by the ties of brotherhood, it is not unknown that police personnel prefer to remain silent and more often than not pervert the truth to save their colleagues.”_


  The deceased Sopore youth is named in two FIRs according to police statement: first under Section 18 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and after his alleged escape, FIR under Section 224 of IPC was registered. The magisterial inquiry on the other hand has a limited mandate of ascertaining ‘how the death was caused and cannot go into ‘who caused the death.’ Therefore, the very comission of registering FIR against any person who could be behind his death brings to fore the approach of the police.


  In a recent, Rhea Chakraborty vs. State of Bihar & Ors, the Supreme Court said, _“...the inquiry conducted under Section 174 CrPC by the Mumbai police is limited for a definite purpose but is not an investigation of a crime under Section 157 of the CrPC.”_ This means, police or other investigation agencies have a mandate to carry out investigation to find out who caused the death.


  At a place, where there is huge distrust between people and government, shielding custodial violence behind formality proceedings defeats the ends of justice and escalates public distrust, which isn’t healthy for any country that believes in rule of law.


  In such circumstances continuing with executive probes, that have been found inadequate long back, shows lack of seriousness on the part of the government to pursue these cases on their merits. In its 152nd report, the Law Commission had said that executive magistrates undertake these investigations as formalities. Law Commission had further suggested that custodial violence should be curbed with a heavy hand to set deterrence for others, but families of victims in Kashmir still await justice.


  Only in January this year, acting on a petition by a human rights activist, the Apex Court sought a response from the Centre and states for the implementation of Section 176 (1) (A) of the CrPC.


  Government forces in Kashmir are time and again called out for violence against civilians. Army has recently admitted the excesses committed under Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) during Shopian (fake?) encounter, in which three Rajouri youth were killed.


  The time consumed by formality-probes although momentarily saves the government facing criticism over a given situation but in the long run it promotes much-abhorred extrajudicial violence against poor civilians and deepens the roots of _Police Raj_.


  Therefore, it is imperative that inquiries are not resorted to for face- saving and to escape the gravity of the moment. Inquiries must be unbiased and independent to the point of common man’s satisfaction.


  The Supreme Court has time and again given paramount importance to common man’s trust. In the recent Rhea Chakraborty case, the court held, “...When integrity and credibility of the investigation is discernible, the trust, faith and confidence of the common man in the judicial process will resonate. When truth meets sunshine, justice will not prevail on the living alone but afterlife’s fitful fever, now the departed will also sleep well... To ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter, this Court considers it appropriate to invoke the powers conferred by Article 142 of the Constitution... the CBI is directed to investigate the new case as well.”


  The CrPC amendment was brought not to be flouted but to curb the growing incidents of custodial violence against defenceless inmates. Relentless deliberations from legal luminaries, civil societies and activists had prodded the government to amend CrPC and bring special provision for custodial deaths. Keeping 176(1)(A) dormant and continuing with the executive inquiries into custodial deaths only defeats the mandate of law and encourages perpetrators.

Many on the right have balked at these demands, although in recent days President Donald Trump indicated he'd be on board with providing an even larger amount of stimulus than Democrats have proposed.

 Trading futures, options on futures, and forex involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The use of leverage is not suitable for all investors and losses exceeding your initial deposit is possible. Carefully consider whether trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances, knowledge, and financial resources and only risk capital should be used. Opinions, market data, and recommendations are subject to change at any time. The lower the margin used the higher the leverage and therefore increases your risk. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.

DUBLIN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Ireland coach Andy Farrell said there were bigger things than finishing the Six Nations competition as the Irish government considers a renewed call by the country's health chiefs for a second national lockdown due to the spread of COVID-19.


  Ireland are due to resume their Six Nations campaign at home to Italy in eight days' time before finishing the tournament that has been delayed by seven months in France on Oct. 31.


  The Italy game can go ahead under Dublin's current Level 3 COVID-19 constraints and also if the measures move up to Level 4. However Ireland's top doctors have called for a jump to the highest stage, Level 5, which would ban elite sport.


  Ministers rejected what was then a surprise recommendation by health chiefs for Level 5 restrictions 11 days ago and are due to discuss the current advice on Saturday.


  "There's bigger things than finishing the Six Nations," Farrell, who took over as Ireland coach after last year's World Cup, told a news conference on Friday.


  "If that (national lockdown) is what the government feel is needed for the health and safety of the country, we'll be more than happy to follow that.


  "But obviously, we'll be doing everything to keep our side of things nice and clean and we'll wait for the advice."


  Ireland's Six Nations clash with Italy became the first big novel coronavirus sporting casualty in the country in March.


  Both teams have only played three matches compared to the four completed by the other sides. A bonus point win for the hosts would put Ireland one point ahead of England and France going into the final round of games.


  "I'd love to play the games. I'd love to get the Six Nations finished and play in the Autumn Nations Cup," Farrell said, referring to the new eight-team international tournament due to start on Nov. 13.


  "We've waited for international rugby to come back. It's a nice tonic for the whole country... but, as I said, there's bigger things than rugby and we'll do the right thing by the country." (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Ken Ferris)

Cory Gardner who has widely been seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbents this year. With Republicans struggling to hold seats in GOP strongholds, few think they can preserve Gardner's seat.
