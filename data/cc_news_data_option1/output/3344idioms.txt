DOVER - Wentworth-Douglass Hospital Chief Executive Officer Gregory Walker will retire from his position Oct. 31.
   
 The announcement came Monday from Board of Trustees chair Carol Bailey, who praised Walker for his hard work and commitment to the organization for 24 years.
   
 "Dover and the surrounding communities have benefited from Greg's visionary leadership over two and a half decades. During his tenure, Wentworth-Douglass Hospital has grown inpatient and outpatient services, expanded where those services are provided, and helped forge the hospital becoming a member of the Massachusetts General Hospital family," said Bailey. "The Wentworth-Douglass Foundation has flourished under Greg's leadership thanks to his passion for philanthropy and the impact it makes on patient care, our community, and staff. All of these improvements ensure that our patients continue to receive the very best care close to home. We are forever indebted to Greg for his countless contributions and he will forever be a part of the Wentworth- Douglass family."
   
 Walker became president of Wentworth-Douglass Hospital in January 1997, after a nationwide search to replace outgoing CEO Ralph Gabarro. He led many successful and long-lasting strategic initiatives, according to Bailey. These included many expansion projects - most notably, the four-story Garrison Wing addition to the hospital building in Dover in 2013, the three-building campus expansion at Pease International Tradeport in Portsmouth (2016-2020), along with clinical program additions and the transformation of Wentworth-Douglass Hospital into an integrated health care system by combining hospital services and community-based physician practices under a single corporate umbrella. His leadership, Bailey said, led to an early collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital in Telestroke services (2006), which later expanded to several other joint clinical programs throughout the years. Ultimately the success of these joint clinical programs led to Wentworth-Douglass becoming a fully integrated and official member of the Massachusetts General Hospital family in 2017.
   
 Reflecting on his nearly 24 years, Walker said, "I am proud of the accomplishments that our organization has seen. Our success is a result of the team of skilled clinicians and employees we have who have contributed so much to this organization's success over the years. I am confident that the future path will continue to showcase many successes. This organization is in a great place and I am honored to have been a part of it."
   
 Bailey announced Jeffrey Hughes, chief operating officer of Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, will serve as interim president for the hospital beginning in October.
   
 Hughes, a key member of the executive leadership team, began his tenure at WentworthDouglass Hospital in 2012, and has held the roles of chief strategy officer and vice president of operations before being promoted to chief operating officer in January of this year.
   
 In announcing Hughes' appointment to interim president, Bailey said his experience, leadership, and collaborative nature will be critical in helping Wentworth-Douglass continue to navigate unprecedented times.
   
 The Wentworth-Douglass Board of Trustees will continue to evaluate the long- term leadership needs of the organization as the proposed affiliation with Exeter Hospital continues to be evaluated by state and federal agencies.

Sure, folks now travel via pneumatic tubes criss-crossing “New New York,” and your TV anchorman is an alien monster who regularly threatens to exterminate the human race, but even in an age of technological marvels, our heroes still spend their time delivering parcels for a living.

The Central Missouri Humane Society is preparing to take in a minimum of 15 cats this week from a large hoarding situation in Sedalia.
   
 Associate Director Michelle Casey said she expects many of the cats will be needing medical treatment. In an interview, Casey said the Humane Society is expecting to treat parasites and various types of infections. Upon arrival, each cat will receive a veterinary evaluation.
   
 "It's a unique situation when it's tied in with the pandemic," Casey said. "Already, we've changed operations a little bit and are trying to do the best we can to keep our staff and animals and the public as safe as possible."
   
 Casey emphasized the need for foster parents, as the shelter is currently seeing an influx of kittens.
   
 Typically, during the spring and summer, shelters across the U.S, see an influx of cats arriving at shelters, which they commonly refer to as "Kitten Season."
   
 The litters that arrive as the weather warms often leads to shelters tight for space because of the number of animals that they are forced to take in.
   
 "We already are pretty overwhelmed, and have a lot of cats here at the shelter and in foster care, but also a lot of requests from people in the public who have animals they can't take care of, or have strays that are that have been having babies and that are in need," she said. "So we are pulled a little thin right now. So taking in even more cats, I mean the need for foster parents is just you know, super great right now."
   
 The Missouri Coalition of Animal Care Organizations expects to take 100 or more cats from the house. Shelters from around Missouri and two neighboring states will lend a hand in finding new homes for the kittens.
   
 On Wednesday, volunteers will go to Sedalia to remove the cats and transport them to the various partner organizations. Then, the shelters will tackle medical care and prepare them for adoption.
   
 In an email from the Columbia shelter, it stated medical costs could easily exceed $10,000.
   
 According to the coalition's president, Abbie Knudsen, cases like this are considered emergency response efforts. The owner of the cats is cooperating with the coalition, but the number of cats and need for medical care is cause for concern.
   
 "In this particular case, the Sedalia Animal Shelter is the local shelter where the home is in their local community, and they would not be able to take a hundred cats into their shelter and adopt them out," Knudsen said. "So we connected with them to help them identify other partners all across the state and even beyond Missouri. We have partners in Illinois, as well as Kansas, that are going to help prepare these cats for adoption."
   
 As of now, the coalition has identified around a dozen partner organizations that are willing to take in some of the cats that are located in the home.
   
 "Organizations from every corner of the state...with different types of communities, with different types of adoption programs, have all come forward to offer to help, and we built this sort of network of all different shelters and rescues to all stand behind the [Sedalia] animal shelter, and essentially say 'we're here to support you," she said.
   
 The Sedalia Animal Shelter is expected to take around 10 of the kittens, but all of the shelters involved are attempting to be flexible, according to Knudsen. Each shelter is currently expecting to take in around 10-15 of the cats.
   
 While there is no formal reporting system for cases like this within the state, the coalition has seen a few similar cases this year. According to Knudsen, the coalition doesn't always see hoarding situations with cats. Sometimes it's small animals like rats or mice, and other times it's larger animals like dogs or cats.
   
 "When many, many, many cats live in a small space, one of the most common things we see are upper respiratory infections," she said.
   
 The cats shouldn't have long-term issues, once they receive medical care and less crowded conditions, Knudsen said.
   
 "So they get well, and they can go to homes and they can live a long, perfectly normal life with their families," she said.
   
 Knudsen also noted how proud she was of the many organizations that have stepped up to welcome the cats into their shelters.
   
 "We're going to take care of our animals here in Missouri," Knudsen said. "I think that's something to be really, really proud of."
