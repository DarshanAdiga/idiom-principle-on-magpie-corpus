According to the American Cancer Society, there were 1.7 million new cases and 0.6 million cancer deaths in 2019 in the USA. The four most common types of cancer worldwide are lung, prostate, bowel, and female breast cancer, accounting for 43% of all the new cancer cases. Therefore, the rise in the cancer incidence rate globally is anticipated to boost the demand for the gene therapy market over the forthcoming years. Gene therapy is one of the most effective treatments in oncology. In this treatment, new genes are introduced into a cancerous cell or the surrounding tissue to cause cell death or slow the growth of cancer.

At 34 years old, Felix has one of the most decorated careers in track and field history, both on the Olympic stage (nine medals, six gold) and at World Championships (18 medals, 13 gold). However, it's her incredible work off the track that brought her among the powerful voices that join her on the list.
 In 2019, Felix wrote an opinion piece for _The New York Times_ that called out Nike, her former sponsor, for not providing guaranteed protections for pregnant athletes and new moms. (Felix gave birth to her daughter Camryn in 2018.) The public reaction to the piece put pregnancy discrimination in athletics in the spotlight, and the practice was heavily criticized. More female athletes came to Felix's side, offering up their stories.
 As a result, many companies, including Nike, altered their policies regarding athlete pregnancies and maternity leave.
 Her work hasn't stopped there. Felix continues to use her voice for not just athletes, but for maternity rights for all woman. She has also been a major voice amidst the Black Lives Matter movement, including joining a march in June following the murder of George Floyd.
 Felix is training to earn a spot on Team USA for the Tokyo Games, which would be her fourth Olympic team.

Suzuki Motorcycle India has announced to launch a new motorcycle on 7th October 2020 One of the fastest growing two wheeler brands in India, Suzuki Motorcycle will be launching a new motorcycle on 7th October. This has been confirmed via company's latest teaser; which reads - \"Introducing A Superior Way To Ride.\" In addition to this, there is not much info revealed. If you look closely, the teaser image text has been imposed on a shape which resembles the digital speedometer of the Gixxer and Intruder motorcycles. Considering that the Gixxer series already has been launched with 155cc and 250cc engine option, it is likely that this new teaser more or less is indicating towards the launch of much awaited Intruder 250 cruiser motorcycle. Back in June this year, we had shared leaked patent images of Intruder 250. Existing Intruder is powered by the same 155cc engine which is seen on board the Gixxer 155cc. Not only that, the two also share a lot of parts like digital speedometer, brake system, etc. With Suzuki launching Gixxer 250 in India, it was only time that the Intruder 250 was launched. Engine Specs As mentioned before, new Suzuki Intruder 250 will be sharing engine with the existing Gixxer 250. It will be powered by a single cylinder 249cc oil cooled SOHC FI engine which is rated to deliver 26.5 PS @ 9300 rpm of power and 22.2 Nm @ 7300 rpm of peak torque. Engine is mated to a 6 speed gearbox while starter system is electric. In comparison, Intruder 150 FI receives a 154.9cc, single cylinder, 4 stroke, SOHC, air cooled engine offering 14.8 PS peak power at 8,000 rpm and 14 Nm peak torque at 6,000 rpm. This engine gets mated to a 5 speed gearbox. Dimensions of the new Suzuki Intruder 250 will be more or less similar to the Intruder 150 - which is 2130 mm long, 805mm wide, 1095 mm tall, 740 mm seat height, wheelbase of 1405 mm, ground clearance of 170 mm, fuel tank capacity of 11 liters. Kerb wt will be in the range of 165 kgs. Rivals Demand for cruiser motorcycles is on the rise. For long, it has been the territory of Royal Enfield motorcycles like the Classic, Bullet and the Thunderbird change. But times have been changing. In 2018, Jawa arrived; Bajaj also launched a more powerful Avenger - all with the aim to eat into the market share of Royal Enfield. But none have managed to succeed as RE enjoys near monopoly with over 85% market share. Now, in a span of few days, there is a likely chance that two new cruisers will be launched in India - both will be rival to the Royal Enfield's. One will be from Honda, which will launch on 30th Sep (to be called Highness), the other will be from Suzuki, in the form of Intruder 250. With the launch of Intruder 250, Suzuki would be largely aiming at taking on the Bajaj Avenger series, which manages about 6k units sales every month. In comparison, the Intruder only manages about 150 units a month.

Finally, we know for sure.
 William Barr is not the country’s attorney general — he is Trump’s personal attorney. Barr has done significant damage to this country with his persistent refusal to address the facts of Trump’s egregious behavior. Now he has charged our country with the legal bills and any monetary compensation that might be awarded to Ms. E. Jean Carroll resulting from her lawsuit against Trump for defamation of character.
 Why? Because Trump denied during a federal investigation that he raped Ms. Carroll in a Bergdorf-Goodman dressing room some years ago. She still has the dress with the semen stain.
 Barr claims Trump’s denial, now that he is president, allows Trump to charge his legal bills to the federal government. Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank calls it “government of the Donald, by the Donald and for the Donald.” Moving the case out of the New York state court and into federal court allows Barr to deny it a hearing. For the Donald.
 Whether her case has merit is a question for a judge and jury. It is not the federal government’s place to pay Trump’s bills or bail him out.
 In other news, Bob Woodward’s new book, “Rage,” reveals that Trump told Woodward in his Feb. 7 interview that the coronavirus is, “deadly stuff. You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed.” There is now no question that Trump knew the danger from COVID-19 to the public early on but he chose to deny that reality. Three days later, Trump told Fox news anchor Trish Regan and the American public that, “We have it very much under control.” But of course we didn’t.
 On Feb. 28, at a rally in South Carolina, Trump said the virus was the Democrats’ “new hoax.” As Milbank says, “It was a life-or-death decision, and Trump chose himself.” Trump’s mantra — Don’t roil the stock market — won out over people’s lives.
 Trump now acknowledges that he knew the danger, but says he withheld warning the public to prevent panic. But this is a man who governs by panic. He loves chaos and fosters it. He’s very much like the firebug who starts the fire and then rushes in to save the day.
 It’s the same thing he did with the Black Lives Matter demonstration in front of the White House. He sent in federal police to gas and beat peaceful protesters and then marched to St. Paul’s church holding the Bible, as though he was saving the day.
 Trump conflates peaceful protesters with criminals, but Trump’s interference into peaceful protests has caused the very crimes he rails against. Moreover, his rhetoric approving their violent actions gives Patriot Boys and their ilk the sense that what they are doing is right.
 Trump doesn‘t seem to understand that if you hit people, they are going to hit back. Likewise, if you put tariffs on goods we import from China, China is going to put tariffs on the goods they import from us. Or, worse yet, they stop buying from us and buy from other countries who don’t have tariffs. Which leaves American farmers with no market for their grain.
 So, what did Trump do? He raided our treasury to compensate farmers for their losses. This is how we got to a $26 trillion deficit, the highest per capita debt since World War II.
 So now, Trump admits that he knew and did nothing. After all, he was protected by stringent prevention protocols in the White House, and he really doesn’t care about anyone else. Once again, subverting the public’s good for his own — at the cost of infecting 6 million people and the loss of 200,000 lives, along with doing major damage to the economy.
 Remember Benghazi, the four deaths that consumed six GOP-controlled congressional committees for literally years? The coronavirus death toll is now more than 47,000 times the death toll in Benghazi. Or, more than 60 times the death toll from 9/11, and almost four times the death toll of the Vietnam war, which lasted 19 years. Our per-capita death rate is double Canada’s, four times higher than Germany’s, 20 times that of Australia, and 90 times that of South Korea.
 It can only be explained by astounding incompetence, coupled with Trump’s need to appear he is on top of things. He reminds me of the Wizard of Oz, who calls himself the great and powerful Oz while in reality, he is just a self- aggrandizing, blustering little man, pulling levers behind a curtain.
