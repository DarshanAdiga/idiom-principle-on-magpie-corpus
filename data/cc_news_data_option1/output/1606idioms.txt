The world, it seems, needs more compact crossovers. Toyota has deemed it so, and taken its hugely popular Yaris out bush to learn to look after itself. Jacked-up, lengthened and fitted with an AWD hybrid powertrain, it'll make its debut in 2021.
 The Yaris Cross will come in petrol and hybrid versions, both using a three- cylinder, 1.5-liter engine driving the front wheels. The hybrid version will be available in front wheel drive or electric all wheel drive. Not all of these options will be available in every market. The gas-only version lets you choose between a manual or CVT auto, where the hybrids get one of Toyota's nifty hybrid shift systems.
 The Yaris has always been roomier than it looks from the outside, and the Yaris Cross cabin will be almost identical, with a little added headroom and luggage space thanks to a taller body that also rides higher on its suspension.

The post-Covid-19 world order will adversely affect Africa. It is therefore imperative for Africans to be vigilant and active in the reshaping of the rules of engagement after the time of corona. The starting point should be to double their efforts limiting the spread of the pandemic. This should be done concurrently with improvements of the public health, safeguarding food security and ensuring that Africa and Africans in the diaspora are at the forefront of the research in finding vaccines for Covid-19.

The utility has cautioned that power cuts were likely to resume post the lockdown, but at least Eskom will be on the front foot. When load shedding typically hits, Eskom barely has the room to perform even routine maintenance, which impacts plant reliability thus further increasing the risk of additional unit trips. It is this elevated risk that sees prolonged period of load shedding, from which it is difficult to recover. Separately, the ‘clarity’ created by the lack of fiscal space should see a focused effort to resolve Eskom debt problem, after years of kicking the can down the road.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The Carolina Panthers have selected defensive tackle Derrick Brown from Auburn with the seventh overall pick in the NFL draft. Brown is expected to bolster a unit that was ravaged in free agency and in dire need of an upgrade. The 6-foot-5, 326-pound Brown was a first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team All-SEC selection as a senior. Carolina was torn between taking Brown and Clemson linebacker Isaiah Simmons with the No. 7 pick, but general manager Marty Hurney says the Panthers wanted to begin building up front on the defensive line.ATLANTA (AP) — The Atlanta Falcons moved to bolster their secondary by taking Clemson cornerback A.J. Terrell with the No. 16 pick in the NFL draft. Following the release of top corner Desmond Trufant in a salary-cap move, the Falcons had an obvious need. There was speculation that Atlanta would try to trade up to the No. 9 pick to grab the highest-rated college cornerback, Florida’s CJ Henderson. But Jacksonville held on to that choice and grabbed Henderson, leaving the Falcons to look elsewhere. Terrell wound up being the choice. The Atlanta native joins a youthful group that includes Isaiah Oliver and Kendall Sheffield,UNDATED (AP) — The Arizona Cardinals have added a big piece for their defensive rebuild, grabbing Clemson linebacker Isaiah Simmons after he surprisingly fell to the No. 8 pick in the NFL draft. The Cardinals were expected to take an offensive tackle or a defensive lineman with their first selection but the prospect of adding the versatile Simmons proved too good an opportunity. The 6-foot-4, 230-pounder was a do-everything defender for the Tigers. He had 104 total tackles, seven sacks and three interceptions in 2019. Simmons will join a Cardinals defense that was among the worst in the NFL last season and gave up the most total yards in the league.CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — The governor of North Carolina says he is still evaluating a request from NASCAR to allow the series to resume racing at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May. Governor Roy Cooper has extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 8. But he says he has been in contact with NASCAR and Speedway Motorsports about holding the Coca-Cola 600 on May 24 as scheduled. Cooper also says teams can go back to work at their shops to prepare for races in other states. Both Florida and Texas have said NASCAR can race in those states without fans.ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) — A county in South Carolina has approved a deal loaded with tax breaks for the Carolina Panthers to move their headquarters and practice site. News outlets report the York County Council approved the deal in a 4-3 vote after listening to public comments during the virtual meeting Monday. It follows a series of moves the state has made to attract the team’s headquarters from Charlotte, North Carolina, where the Panthers will continue to play games. The council says the deal will give the team a break from property taxes for 20 to 25 years.UNDATED (AP) — The San Francisco 49ers have made a pair of trades in the NFL draft. They moved down one spot to take defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw at No. 14 and then up six spots to take receiver Brandon Aiyuk with the 25th selection. The picks help the defending NFC champions fill two big holes created last month when star defensive tackle DeForest Buckner was traded to Indianapolis and receiver Emmanuel Sanders left in free agency. Aiyuk had a breakthrough season in 2019 for Arizona State with 65 catches for 1,192 yards and eight TDs.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-GEORGIATrump's criticism adds to tough choices in Georgia reopeningATLANTA (AP) — President Donald Trump’s blunt disapproval of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to let some businesses reopen is only making decisions tougher for many owners, workers and customers. Hair stylist Shannon Stafford says she's having second thoughts about reopening her Savannah salon Friday. Georgia coronavirus cases have risen past 21,000, with deaths hitting 847 on Thursday. Unemployment claims for another 244,000 Georgia workers were processed last week. Congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Doug Collins is criticizing Kemp, saying the fellow Republican has “caused a lot of confusion." Collins rival and Kemp-appointed U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler is saying she wants to support both Trump and Kemp.VIRUS OUTBREAK- CONTRASTING GOVERNORSRepublicans leap to reopen economy; Democrats more cautiousCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Mostly Republican governors in a handful of states are racing ahead with reboots to their economy before they have met key health benchmarks recommended to control the coronavirus outbreak. Their approach stands in contrast to numerous Democratic governors who continue to maintain a cautious approach to reopening and have said they will base their decisions primarily on public health data. Governors pushing to fast-track their economic rebounds say they don’t want to endanger their residents, but numerous public health experts say that is what could happen if they don't slow down.SEVERE WEATHERAt least 7 dead as storms hit Oklahoma, Texas and LouisianaMADILL, Okla. (AP) — Severe weather is blowing across the South after apparent tornadoes tore through parts of Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana. At least seven people have been killed, including a factory worker whose body was found a quarter mile from where an apparent tornado struck the factory in southern Oklahoma. A Louisiana man was swept away in flood waters after going out to grab a trash can, and a woman was killed on a bridge. Three more died when apparent tornado touched down near Onalaska, Texas. More than 150,000 customers are without power.AP-US-DEMOCRAT-ENDORSES-TRUMP-GEORGIAGeorgia Democrat who endorsed Trump not quitting after allATLANTA (AP) — A Democratic Georgia lawmaker who recently endorsed President Donald Trump announced that he is no longer planning to resign and will instead serve the remainder of his term. A day after Rep. Vernon Jones said he would resign effective immediately, Jones posted a Twitter video Thursday stating he changed his mind because he received “overwhelming” support from his constituents. The Democrat made waves last week when he endorsed Trump, stating in a video that he’s backing the Republican president because of his support for criminal justice reform and historically black colleges and universities. A spokesman says Jones will complete his term, but has withdrawn his candidacy for re- election.BASILICA DESIGNATEDPope Francis designates Savannah Cathedral as minor basilicaSAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — Officials said Pope Francis has issued a decree granting a Catholic cathedral in Georgia the title of Minor Basilica, which highlights the significance and value of the institution. News outlets reported Thursday that the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Savannah will officially be named “The Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist." The cathedral's rector, The Rev. J. Gerald Schreck, said it is the first basilica in the Diocese of Savannah. The 143-year old cathedral was built in 1896 and rebuilt in 1899 after a fire destroyed the building. Nationwide, there are just 87 churches, including 18 cathedrals, that carry the “basilica” designation.VIRUS OUTBREAK-TRUMP-DOCTORSDoctors struggle to stay true to science but not cross TrumpWASHINGTON (AP) — For medical officials, advising the White House on the coronavirus is very tricky. The medical specialists struggle to stay true to the science of the pandemic while trying not to cross President Donald Trump. This produces some bewildering scenes for Americans trying to understand how best to protect themselves from the virus. On Tuesday, for example, Dr. Deborah Birx suggested that beauty salons and tattoo parlors in Georgia might be able to safely operate by using “creative” forms of social distancing. But she later told Trump privately that Georgia’s reopening plan was too hasty.BC-US-VIRUS OUTBREAK-TRUMP-GEORGIATrump approved of Georgia's reopen plan before bashing itPresident Donald Trump praised Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s aggressive plan to allow businesses to reopen in private discussions before pulling an about-face and publicly bashing it. That is according to two administration officials not authorized to discuss the conversations. Kemp’s order allows businesses like gyms, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to open Friday under certain restrictions. It’s one of the most aggressive plans in the nation for reopening a state’s economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. Trump had been supportive but changed course Wednesday after members of his task force revisited the plan and decided it was too soon.GEORGIA SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTGeorgia district picks ex-leader of New York, Miami schoolsATLANTA (AP) — One of Georgia’s largest school districts is likely to be led by the former leader of New York City’s school system. The DeKalb County school board members on Thursday named Rudy Crew as their sole finalist to lead the 96,000-student district. DeKalb often suffers in comparison to other suburban Atlanta districts, and has been beset by financial and administrative turmoil in recent years. Crew led New York City schools from 1995 to 2000 and led Miami-Dade County schools from 2004 to 2008. He has been president of Medgar Evers College in New York since 2013.
