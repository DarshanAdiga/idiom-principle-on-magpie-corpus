The Precice plating system is the latest advancement in the Precice portfolio of non-invasively adjustable implants from NSO. Leveraging a locking plate technology, the Precice Plate is mounted on the outside of the patient's bone to avoid potential damage to the growth plate of this young patient population. Once implanted, the patient or caregiver uses a programmable external remote controller that magnetically couples with the Precice Plate through the skin to perform precision micro adjustments. Over the course of several months and from the comfort of their own home, the patient follows a custom lengthening schedule to gradually distract the Precice Plate, stretching newly forming bone to a targeted length. Once the desired bone length is achieved, the plate is removed. __

MADRID, 9 Sep. (EUROPA PRESS) -
    La cristiana pakistaní Asia Bibi, que pasó ocho años en el corredor de la muerte en Pakistán y fue absuelta en octubre de 2018 de la condena a pena de muerte por blasfemia, ha pedido cambiar la Ley de blasfemia en Pakistán para evitar los "abusos" que afectan a las minorías religiosas.
    "Hoy en día hay algunos grupos que están abusando de las leyes existentes, por lo que hago un llamamiento al primer ministro de Pakistán, especialmente para las víctimas de las leyes sobre blasfemia y las niñas que han sido convertidas a la fuerza, para salvaguardar y proteger a las minorías, que son también ciudadanos paquistaníes", ha subrayado en una entrevista con la fundación pontificia Ayuda a la Iglesia Necesitada (CAN), recogida por Europa Press.
    Según precisa, "en el momento de la fundación y separación de Pakistán de la India, el fundador Ali Jinnah, en su discurso de apertura, garantizó la libertad de religión y pensamiento a todos los ciudadanos", ha declarado Bibi. Sin embargo, añade que algunos grupos están "abusando" de las leyes existentes.
    Bibi cuenta su propia experiencia. "Sufrí terriblemente y viví muchas dificultades pero ahora soy libre y espero que estas leyes se puedan cambiar de tal manera que se evite cualquier abuso de ellas", ha insistido.
    Según el Informe para la Libertad Religiosa publicado por AIN, las llamadas "leyes de blasfemia", incorporadas en 1986 al Código Penal de Pakistán, "limitan enormemente la libertad de religión y de expresión", con penas que pueden llegar a ser de cadena perpetua, por la profanación del Corán, o de pena de muerte, por insultar a Mahoma.
    Desde su residencia actual en Canadá, Asia Bibi también ha recordado el "drama" de numerosas menores de edad pakistaníes "secuestradas, convertidas y obligadas a contraer matrimonio a la fuerza".
    Preguntada por el caso de Huma Younus y Maira Shahbaz, dos jóvenes cristianas víctimas de abusos cuyos casos está defendiendo la fundación, Bibi ha hecho un llamamiento al primer ministro de Pakistán, Imran Khan. "¡Ayuden a nuestras niñas porque ninguna de ellas tendría que sufrir!", ha exclamado.
    Asia Bibi asegura que tiene un "profundo deseo" de visitar Roma y encontrarse, si es posible, con el Papa Francisco, a quien asegura sus oraciones.

PUNTA ALA – “Nulla di più verde di un campo da golf nelle nostre colline può rappresentare un luogo sano, pulito, ideale”. Con questo spirito, la società grossetana Hera – Soluzioni territoriali celebra anche quest’anno l’anniversario della sua fondazione con una giornata-evento che rievoca la passione per l’ambiente e per il territorio dei suoi due soci fondatori, Marco Bisdomini e Massimo Fanti.
 Si tratta dell’Hera Cup 2020, in programma sabato 12 settembre presso il Golf Club Punta Ala. L’intenzione degli organizzatori è di dare vita ad una manifestazione che possa interessare ed attirare soggetti diversi, dai cittadini ai turisti, dai golfisti agli intenditori di vini, dai clienti delle aziende coinvolte agli appassionati di musica, ai semplici curiosi.
 “Un’occasione per incontrarsi, dove un’azienda può presentarsi al golfista o dove, al contrario, l’imprenditore può avvicinarsi al mondo del golf, e lo stesso vale per l’arte e la musica – spiega Marco Bisdomini -. L’intenzione, per quest’anno in cui festeggiamo 16 anni di attività, era di organizzare un evento molto più strutturato. Purtroppo le note vicende che hanno caratterizzato questa infausta annata ci hanno costretto a rivedere i nostri piani. Soprattutto grazie alla famiglia Damiani, proprietaria del Golf Club Punta Ala, siamo riusciti a realizzare la seconda edizione della Hera Cup che, come da tradizione, prevede un torneo di golf accompagnato da degustazioni enogastronomiche del territorio maremmano, ed interamente sponsorizzato da aziende del territorio. Per l’amicizia che mi lega al mio socio Massimo Fanti e per tutto ciò che negli anni abbiamo condiviso, ho voluto dedicare questo particolare trofeo alla memoria di sua madre, Costantina Cerignoli”.
 “E’ con grande piacere che ospitiamo questo evento nel nostro campo – commenta Fernando Damiani, proprietario Golf Club Punta Ala – Ciò che stanno facendo gli amici Marco Bisdomini e Massimo Fanti è di grande importanza per tutto il territorio,ed a noi fa particolare piacere essere al centro di questo progetto , che abbraccia sport, cultura, enogastronomia e solidarietà. Abbiamo anche il piacere di poter presentare il nostro campo in perfette condizioni ed una Club House completamente ristrutturata da cui ammirare tutta la baia di Punta Ala con l’Isola d’Elba, Cerboli, Palmaiola e Capraia”.
 La giornata si aprirà al mattino, alle 8.30, con il Torneo di Golf Hera Cup – 18 buche Stableford 3 categorie, con il premio speciale Hera alla buca 15. Durante il percorso di gara, per i soli iscritti ed i loro accompagnatori, ci sarà una degustazione di prodotti enogastronomici del territorio maremmano.
 Dalle ore 15 alle 17 è previsto il campo pratica, aperto a tutti gli interessati, con l’assistenza di maestri e giocatori esperti. Dalle ore 18 alle ore 20 è in programma un concerto jazz sul terrazzo panoramico del Golf Club di Punta Ala, con ingresso ad offerta libera. L’appuntamento, dal titolo “Classical italian songs & latin Jazz” è realizzato sotto la direzione artistica del maestro Giovanni Lanzini, con Alessia Martegiani e Maurizio Di Fulvio, rispettivamente voce e chitarra.
 Il ricavato del concerto sarà devoluto in favore della Fondazione Giuseppe Orlando, ente senza scopo di lucro costituito nel 2000 da Confcommercio- Imprese per l’Italia.
 “Siamo veramente grati agli organizzatori dell’evento per aver pensato alla nostra Fondazione nazionale – commentano Carla Palmieri e Gabriella Orlando, presidente e direttore Confcommercio Grosseto – in prima linea per fornire un concreto sostegno attraverso l’assistenza immediata agli imprenditori colpiti da calamità naturali e da eventi criminosi. Anche noi, nel recente passato, ne abbiamo purtroppo fatto ricorso; nel novembre 2012, abbiamo infatti ottenuto dalla Fondazione e distribuito 30.000 euro alle attività commerciali e ricettive della nostra provincia danneggiate dall’alluvione”. All’appuntamento sarà presente Marisa Tiberio, presidente nazionale della Fondazione Orlando.
 Sabato 12 settembre seguirà alle ore 20.30 la cena di gala, solo su prenotazione. Tutti gli appuntamenti della giornata sono aperti al pubblico previa prenotazione, anche singolarmente. Per esempio si potrà partecipare solo al concerto, solo alla cena o ad entrambi. Per informazioni e prenotazioni scrivere ad info@herasrl.it, oppure telefonare al numero 392 9096319.
 Per prendere parte al torneo di golf, invece, è necessaria la preventiva iscrizione chiamando il Golf Club Punta Ala al numero 0564 922121, o scrivere a info@golfpuntaala.it .
 Per l’organizzazione dell’evento, il ringraziamento va ai seguenti sponsor: Le Piccole Macie (Poggio la Mozza), Antichi Gusti di Maremma (Campagnatico), Az.

last week. In August, it was Asia’s best and the fourth-best globally. For many, this has been a surprising turnaround in a country that registered a nine-year low growth rate only 12 months ago. Not to mention that the Pakistan stock exchange crashed with much of the rest of the global market when Covid-19 hit in March. So what explains Pakistan's success?
 It is no coincidence that the stock market highs have come in light of Pakistan transforming into a rare and perhaps unlikely Covid-19 success story, having largely curtailed the spread of the virus in a region still reeling with the impact of the pandemic. But while Pakistan’s apparent triumph over Covid-19 still remains a healthcare mystery, the roots of the stock market’s rally are more discernible. And it is another story that Imran Khan's government will happily crow about after two tumultuous years in power.

Bard also stressed, however, that when the air is clearer it's just as important that people ride bikes and find other ways to reduce exposure to the regular, day-by-day pollution caused by private automobiles.

"Bicycling is one of the most healthy and climate-friendly forms of transportation," she said, adding that it's important for local governments to continue building protected bike lanes and other safe infrastructure to encourage more people to cycle.
