“That man only gave love you could feel. He cuff you down? Honeymoon. He gave you a black eye? True love in your tail. He break your hand? A love letter. He put you in hospital for a week? Love will stay the course. He take a knife and stab your leg? Til death do us part.” After hearing this excerpt of _Love After Love_ , I was taken aback by the visceral frankness of this account of a woman’s abusive relationship with an alcoholic. Exploring themes like domestic abuse, family dynamics, hope, and love as a healer of deep-seated issues, this is a novel that can be described as a restorative account of the power of love as a guide to therapize.

Oshiwara police on Friday arrested a 28-year-old choreographer for allegedly posing as an official of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and cheating an eye specialist to the tune of ₹26,600. The accused has been identified as Vivek Sadare, a resident of DN Nagar, Andheri (West).Dayanand Bangar, senior inspector from Oshiwara police station, said that they received a complaint from a doctor last month saying that two men came to his clinic posing as BMC officials and questioned him about non- payment of signboard charges.According to Dr Sanjay Chaudhary, the complainant, the conmen told the doctor that he had not paid signboard charges -- charges for putting up his board outside the dispensary -- to BMC since the past two years and therefore, he will have to pay the charges along with a fine."The accused told him that the total amount to be paid was ₹26,600. The next day, one of the accused went to the dispensary and collected the amount," Bangar added.Chaudhary later realised that the two had conned him, and approached the police. A team led by sub-inspectors Mahendra Puri and Tushar Sawant checked footages of all CCTV cameras installed in the area and identified Sadare and arrested him from DN Nagar on Thursday. Police said the accused has another case of cheating registered against him at Khar police station.

This November 3rd the citizens of Saratoga Springs will have another chance to finally push a new city charter over the top. The charter developed by the 2017 Charter Review Commission fell short by only 10 votes. The new proposed charter is essentially the same, with one major improvement: the addition of ward system of city council representation.
 This new opportunity to move from an antiquated commission form of government to a more democratic and less costly council-manager form comes as a result of over 1,500 signatures collected by private citizens, petitioning for change. This is a bi-partisan effort seeking to provide diverse citizen representation and a functional and efficient City Hall.
 Currently, our commission form of government is too expensive, too political and lacks professional management. City Hall is divided among five independent departments. No one is in charge, not even the Mayor. The four political commissioners operate independently, and little interdepartmental planning or coordination occurs.

Love stories are overrated and cheesy. But love and logic are at loggerheads when you are in love.
 I have always been in love with cycling. Arms lifted at the sides, head held high, and nostrils sucking in the soft breeze, every ride down the slope was like a take-off. But after marriage, this love took a back seat. Not that I was not allowed, but because the circumstances were not favourable.
 Married to a soldier posted in inhospitable areas, I was compelled to curb my carefree spirit. And the only indulgence I had was an occasional ride that I could manage when my husband was available.
 About 18 months ago, we moved to Bhuj in Kutch. The great thing about Bhuj is its traffic-free smooth roads. Whether it’s a town or village, the roads are a welcoming paradise for bike-lovers.
 So what was I waiting for? There was another obstacle, one which many women cyclists will relate to. Leaving my five-year-old daughter unattended didn’t seem right and once again, I had to quell my desire to ride. And then there was also that fear of the unknown: should I or should I not ride alone?
 "A woman riding alone invites unnecessary attention," a friend objected.
 "I don’t think so, people here seem calm and civilised," I retorted.
 "Oh, but they stare at you."
 "Yes, because they are curious. There is a difference between staring and leering," I defended.
 For the past three months, going on occasional rides with my husband, I had noticed that the local people were decent and well-behaved. Now I wanted to break free from dependence on my husband.
 "And what if your cycle breaks down?"
 I laughed. I realised that there is no end to excuses. We all hide behind these excuses to justify our failed dreams.
 Now was the time.
 The next day, after my husband left for office and daughter for school, I wrapped up the household chores, packed my mini-breakfast and geared my bike. How much time did I have? Five uninterrupted hours. Not bad!
 There is a smooth highway that connects Bhuj with the Mandvi beach. I decided to take this road, as it is not too isolated. It is a smooth road that passes through acres of barren land dotted with cacti and Kikar with just three or four villages.
 I began my solo ride. My stomach lurched every time I thought that a car was slowing down next to me. I would imagine next day’s scary newspaper headlines, and in apprehension, my hand would move swiftly to the pepper spray tucked inside my jersey. For the first 20 km, I was as restless as a teenager on her first date. With narrow, suspicious eyes, I would scan the smiling faces I passed. Rudely, I ignored their cheerful waves. I was on guard.
 Halfway, I stopped at a teashop. I noticed the stall owner watching me with curiosity as I wiped the sweat off my face. I avoided his eyes.
 And then I smiled at him, a carefree, candid smile.
 "Hiren Bhai," he introduced himself. "Are you an NRI?"
 "No, I am from Bhuj."
 "I’ve never seen a woman cyclist here, only some men cyclists on Sundays."
 Three or four villagers had joined us and they were inspecting my bike.
 "You must be tired; here, take the key to my room and freshen up," Hiren Bhai gestured towards a room in the backyard. With a smile, I took the key to the bathroom. When I returned, he had prepared two glasses of masala buttermilk for me.
 As I was about to leave, he took out his notebook. "Here, can you please write something for my daughter," he asked me hesitantly. "I will tell her that I met a woman cyclist."
 My heart had never felt that light and happy when I at last touched the sea after about 65 km riding alone on that highway.
 That was the first of my many solo rides in Bhuj. And every ride was an enriching experience. It not only broadened my understanding of the local culture but also gave me a strong sense of self. Gradually, I have begun to sense a change around me. In our social gatherings, women approach me, not for advice on new fashions or a recipe but about my riding plans. Yes, it is doable. For me and for everyone.
 More than the beautiful handicrafts of Kutch, the real beauty lies in its people. It also taught me that a city is not called civilised by the standards of its sophisticated technology but by the healthy mind of its dwellers. Be it a shepherd or a shopkeeper, everyone has a honest warmth. They are welcoming and free of any unhealthy gender-prejudice towards women.
 On my rides, I have often met interesting people. There is a temple on a hill, about 10 km from the city, surrounded with an expanse of Kikar forests. There I had met an old widow who brewed tea for us and told about her life story, how she left her sons and chose to live here as the caretaker of the temple. I often think about her living all alone in that remote temple, her courage leaving me intimidated.
 Inspirations are all around us, the world is full of stories. Once a week or so, I go for breakfast rides till Praveen Bhai’s dhaba on the Bhuj-Mandvi highway. He is fond of selfies and chit-chats. The last time, he told me the story of the crocodiles in the lake next to his dhaba.
 With each ride, my apprehensions have become fewer and I no longer feel vulnerable or an outsider in this land. I am a person in love with her surroundings and with herself. At last, I am free.

In view of the restrictions to participation of relatives during cremation of those who died due to COVID-19, the city Corporation is set to launch live web streaming of the last rites ceremonies at the Shanthikavadom electric crematorium in Thycaud. The live streaming will be made available in the Smart Trivandrum webpage (www.smarttvm.corporationoftrivandrum.in), in the Shanthikavadom YouTube channel and its facebook page.
 According to the Corporation authorities, quite a few people had expressed their wish to take part in the last rites ceremonies of their close relatives or friends. However, strict restrictions on the number of people allowed had prevented them from taking part. The live web streaming, which can be accessed from any part of the world, is being launched to address this issue.
 Round the clock
 An online software system will be implemented for reserving the furnaces. The booking will be through the Smart Trivandrum mobile application and web portal. Bookings can also be done through the Corporation’s call centre (contact - 9496434488) which will function round-the-clock or directly through Shanthikavadom (0471-2323574).
 The cremation certificates from Shanthikavadom will henceforth be available online too. The name and details of the persons being cremated in the furnaces will be displayed in real-time in a display board at the front.
 ## Officer appointed
 The city Corporation has appointed a charge officer for overseeing the functioning of the crematorium (contact - 9496434410). The Smrithi mandapam located adjacent to the Shanthikavadom will be renovated to be used for memorial events. Work on two more gas furnaces is progressing, in addition to the existing two electric furnaces and four wood furnaces. Aerobic bins and a material recovery facility are also being arranged for the waste management at the facility.
 Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, 381 bodies were cremated here, out of which nine were from outside the State, while 181 were from panchayats located near the city.

My Washington ballot arrived in the mail the other day. I couldn’t wait to open it and place my votes. I have been voting in elections since I turned 18 and could legally vote. It is something I enjoy doing. I do it because I want my voice to be heard.
 I also have a very unpopular opinion when it comes to voting. My opinion is people who don’t know the issues and are unwilling to do research into the issue should do everyone a favor and forego completing a ballot.
 With so many important issues at stake the last thing we need is someone randomly filling in the bubbles on the ballot. In addition to political offices there are also advisory votes, a referendum, and a state constitutional amendment on our ballot.
 One advisory vote is to raise the taxes on commercial airplane manufacturers (ahem, Boeing). Why would we want to raise taxes on Boeing? Didn’t they just move the assembly line of a jet to South Carolina? Are we trying to push Boeing out of Washington? An anti-tax person or someone who doesn’t want to see Boeing exit might vote to repeal the tax.
 What’s important to understand is Boeing asked for the tax to be increased. The state had provided the tax break to Boeing as an incentive to keep jobs in Washington. This tax break could hurt Boeing on an international level as tariffs could be levied on Boeing if the tax break remains. Therefore, even Boeing wants this tax increase.
 Advisory vote No. 32 is our chance to stop the banning of plastic shopping bags. It also stops a fee that will be imposed on everyone who opts to receive a paper bag for groceries. While I am not sure of the status, I thought during the pandemic there was a movement away from using reusable bags for sanitary reasons.
 With Washington’s top 2 system we are left with two Democrats as a choice for lieutenant governor. There is a write-in campaign for Joshua Freed. I have seen some ads and information on Facebook but I do not think there is enough of a push to give Freed a chance at winning. My readers may remember when I endorsed him for the position of governor of Washington. Although I think he was the person who had the best message and the strongest chance of beating Jay Inslee, he didn’t make it through the primaries.
 For the governor we have the incumbent, Inslee, and the challenger, Loren Culp. I have seen a lot of signs endorsing Culp around the county but I don’t think he stands a chance. I would love to see the first Republican governor in Washington since John Spellman. A large percentage of Pullman’s residents were not alive when he was the governor. Heck, even their parents may not be old enough to remember much about Spellman’s time in Olympia.
 As we provide our voice for direction in Washington, remember that there are many positions that are up for election. The current state attorney, Bob Ferguson, spends way too much time pursuing a progressive agenda. The state would be better served with someone who cares more about the people of Washington rather than trying to make a name for himself on the national level.
 Lastly, we have a chance to provide our voice for the direction of the country. We have Cathy McMorris Rodgers up for reelection. The state is staunchly blue, but thankfully there is enough red in Eastern Washington to elect Republicans to represent us in DC.
 Of course there is the presidential election, too. President Trump is a lightning rod and he brings strong feelings from people on both sides of the aisle. His America-first and law and order positions are great reasons to reelect President Trump.

“For YEARS it has been the question from everyone since I got married,” the _Suite Life of Zack and Cody_ alum wrote on her website, frenshe, on September 18. “At first, I rebelled against it, and like clockwork, after I got engaged EVERYONE (and I mean everyone!) asked when I was getting married. Then, once I was married, everyone was asking when I was having kids. To be honest, it just felt invasive.”
