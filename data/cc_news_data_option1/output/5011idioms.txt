Donations to the registered charity have slowed to a trickle as the Covid-19 crisis has gripped the world and fundraisers have quite rightly turned their attention to the coronavirus front line.
 Trustees have reluctantly taken the decision to wind down the charity, and transfer remaining funds to the Birmingham Women’s & Children’s Hospital charity, to be used to help more youngsters with respiratory illness.
 Among the final grants made by the fund during the autumn have been cash to purchase nebulisers and other breathing aids for youngsters in the West Midlands, and support for families affected by Covid-19 and its knock-on effects on NHS treatment.

(AP) – With a COVID-19 vaccine perhaps just days away in the U.S., most of California headed into another lockdown Sunday because of the surging outbreak and top health officials warned Americans that this is no time to let their guard down.“The vaccine’s critical,” Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But it’s not going to save us from this current surge. Only we can save us from this current surge.”A Food and Drug administration advisory panel is scheduled to take up a request Thursday to authorize emergency use of Pfizer’s vaccine. Vaccinations could begin just days later, though initial supplies will be rationed, and shots are not expected to become widely available until the spring.With the U.S. facing what could be a catastrophic winter, top government officials warned Americans anew to wear masks, practice social distancing and follow other basic measures — precautions that President Donald Trump and members of the administration have often disdained.“I hear community members parroting back those situations — parroting back that masks don’t work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity, parroting back that gatherings don’t result in super-spreading events,” Birx said. “And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong and you can see the evidence base.”The virus is blamed for over 280,000 deaths and more than 14.6 million confirmed infections in the U.S. New cases per day have rocketed to an all-time high of more than 190,000 on average. Deaths per day have surged to an average of more than 2,160, a level last seen during the dark days in April, when the outbreak was centered around New York. The number of Americans now in the hospital with the coronavirus topped 100,000 for the first time over the past few days.In California, the first place to enact a statewide lockdown last spring, new stay-at-home orders were set to take effect Sunday night in Southern California, much of the San Francisco Bay area and other areas.Gov. Gavin Newsom said he hopes the new lockdown order is the last one he has to issue, declaring the vaccine offers “light at the end of the tunnel.”Once vaccines are offered widely, they could offer long-lasting protection against COVID-19, the head of the U.S. vaccine development effort said. Dr. Moncef Slaoui told CNN’s “State of the Union” that only time will tell for certain but that the vaccine’s effectiveness could last for “many, many years.”___Associated Press writers Adam Beam and Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, and Hope Yen in Washington contributed to this story.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

LEXINGTON, Ky. — It’s come full-circle.
 In 2005, a close loss would be applauded. In 2010, there was a good team about to get better. In 2013, it was a rare that South Carolina fans complained because the team was losing that one game (not three or four) that kept it from the SEC Championship Game.
 Now it’s back here, finishing a 2-8 season, a two-year stretch of six victories and the effort is the best thing about the Gamecocks’ football team. None of them quit in a 41-18 beating at Kentucky Saturday, and that is notable, but how did it get back here so quickly?
 “This season didn’t go how we wanted it to go, but at the end of the day, just got to get better. That’s all it is,” senior defensive lineman Jabari Ellis said. “Work on your craft, perfect your craft, and get better.”
 Those answers are part of history. USC is making more as new head coach Shane Beamer is on his way.

In the second half of extra time, England's George Ford kicked into the left corner, France wing Alivereti Raka couldn't escape and Maro Itoje tied up the ruck to force a penalty.


  After missing four penalties from seven goalkicks, Farrell lined up the penalty on the French 22 in from the left touch in the 96th minute, and hit it straight through to crown England champion of the eight-team tournament that replaced the canceled end-of-year tours.


  England was supposed to win the final out of sight. France was forced by its Top 14 clubs to put out a rookie side, a week after debuting 11. France had no starters from the team which won this matchup 24-17 in February in Paris, while England had 10 starters back and keen to avenge its only loss this year.


  But the French rookies matched England’s physicality, unleashed gutsy defense, and took their chances. They were seconds away from an extraordinary win.


  Farrell kicked the first points from a scrum penalty won by loosehead prop Ellis Genge, a late injury replacement for Mako Vunipola. Vunipola's absence brought down England's total caps in the starting XV to 772, still lopsided compared to France's 68, its second lowest ever.


  Fullback Brice Dulin accounted for 30 of those caps and he claimed the first try as France showed its depth of talent from an attacking lineout. Flyhalf Matthieu Jalibert burst through a gap, drew the last man, and had three men outside him. He gave the try to Dulin.

Hospital bed availability has continued to shrink across the state, according to Louisiana Department of Health data. As of Friday, there were only four intensive care unit beds at hospitals in the Acadiana region, and about two- thirds of overall hospital beds in and around Baton Rouge, New Orleans and the North Shore were also occupied.
 With more people landing in hospitals due to severe bouts of the virus, state health officials say some facilities may be forced to scale back on non- emergency operations, such as knee and hip replacements, heart surgeries and screenings, among others.
 But any decision to scale back on elective procedures will likely come from the facility itself, rather than a mandate from the state of governor’s office.
 Dr. Joseph Kanter, the Office of Public Health interim assistant secretary at the state Department of Health, said hospitals now have a better idea of what other types of services they can continue, especially procedures that involve overnight stays in the hospital.
 "The preference across the board ... is that it's a better situation for everyone when hospitals can make these kinds of rollbacks themselves when they think they need to," he said.
 St. Tammany Parish Health System recently stopped certain surgeries and operations due a rise in COVID-19 patients that hospital leaders expect could grow. The Covington hospital joined a growing number of health systems, many in the Upper Midwest and other hard-hit states, that have made similar moves recently.
 Smaller, rural hospitals may also be more vulnerable to putting back certain procedures because they lack the flexibility of more space and workers than larger facilities.
 “If one or two nurses that get sick that’s a huge deal for us,” said Kassie Roussel, a spokeswoman for St. James Parish Hospital. “In a small hospital, those resources are even more important.”
 The 25-bed hospital in Lutcher saw the realities of an overstretched rural hospital when it was caring for more than double the number of inpatients it usually sees.
 The facility has been able to resume elective services when the height of the spring surge abated, a factor the hospital credited to staff being more familiar with the virus and more resources like protective equipment.
 Limited supplies of ventilators and protective equipment for medical workers were a significant part of the decision near the start of the pandemic to tap the brakes on in-person clinic visits, screenings and non-emergency operations.
 Health chains like Oschner managed to clear the nearly two-month-long backlog of surgeries and procedures when they were allowed to resume in May, but the health impacts of those delays are still unknown.
 Putting off certain procedures could lead to worse outcomes for people who've suffered recent injuries or had to forgo operations like cancer removal or heart surgery.
 In some cases, delaying a procedure like a minor heart blockage could worsen to the point where emergency intervention is needed, leading to riskier operations and other complications.
 "The whole survivability of the disease changes, and that's just heart disease,” Dauterive said.

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS - Patricia "Gail" Whyte was born March 9, 1940 in Chicago to Harvey and Mary (nee Whalen) Burgie. She died November 24, 2020 at the Lutheran Home in Arlington Heights after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease complicated with progressive aphasia. Gail was a hard worker, a person who always kept herself very busy and made earning a college degree a lifelong mission. After graduating from Wauconda High School in 1958 and a brief stint in college, she took an office job in downtown Chicago. While living in the Northeast for almost 30 years, she earned an Associate's degree and eventually earned her Bachelor's degree from Olivet-Nazarene University after moving back to the Chicago area in the mid-90's. Gail loved theater, was a volunteer usher, performed with the Footlighters in Des Plaines and sang in several singing groups over the years including the Stuart W. Smith Singers of New Jersey in the 1960s and the New Beginnings Chorus in Arlington Heights in the early 2000's. The caring staff of Lutheran Home knew Gail's boundless energy and inability to sit still manifested in her walking the halls greeting everyone in her path. From time to time she also attempted to escape to take herself out to lunch- something she always enjoyed. Gail is survived by her sister, Virginia Moriarity; and by her daughters, Heather (Gregg Hudson) Whyte and Lindsey (Emilio Di Benedetto) Whyte; her adoring grandchildren, Cassidy, Marco and Annabel; many nieces and nephews. She is preceded in death by her sisters, Marjorie Harriet (late Daniel) Bobzin and Barbara (late Frank) DeSimone; and by her parents. Due to COVID 19 restrictions, memorial services will be held at a later date. Gifts in Gail's memory can be made to CureAlz.org or The Harbour in Park Ridge.

The iPhone 12 Mini isn't just a good phone, it's also a good value. $700 feels right for what you get here, and this is a genuine flagship experience -- if not at the new "Ultra" level that phones like the 12 Pro Max and Galaxy Note20 Ultra hit. However, pricing is a little odd: You either pay $700 outright for a carrier model or $730 SIM-free, and I don't understand why it isn't the same across the board, as it usually is. Even if you drop the extra $30, it still feels worth it to me, though just 64GB of base storage really isn't enough in 2020.

Moncef Slaoui, the head of the US government's effort to develop a vaccine against Covid-19, on Sunday praised President-elect Joe Biden's plan to ask all Americans to wear masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus, saying the practice is key as the country awaits widespread distribution of the vaccine.
 "I think it's a good idea, it's never too late. This pandemic is ravaging the country. We all need to take our precaution, wear our masks, wash our hands, keep our distance, remain aware that this virus is a killer," Slaoui told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union."
 "We have a vaccine, there is light at the end of the tunnel, but we will not all have the vaccine in our arms before May or June, so we need to be very cautious and vigilant," he added.
 Biden told Tapper in an exclusive interview last week that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office, though his transition team is treading lightly so far, saying little about how the incoming administration plans to address the plan.

Dogs living in animal shelters remind me of the iconic Broadway show “Annie.” Early in the show, Annie and the other orphans sing, “It’s a hard-knock life.” With lyrics like “instead of kisses, we get kicked” you quickly learn that these girls, like shelter dogs, have experienced bad things in their lives but they still hope someone will love them.
 Toby was just such a dog when a special guardian angel named Charlene found him. One February night, Charlene saw a dog with no collar walking in a parking lot on a busy road. Even though she was on her way to church, she stopped to check on him. She returned later in the evening to take Toby home, but he was gone. Store workers told her the dog had been coming around since a man had thrown the little dog out of his car in the parking lot. For six weeks, Toby had been living on the few scraps the workers had given him and he had been sleeping outside during the cold nights.
 Charlene came back the next day and found Toby. When she put him in her car, the little dog began shaking violently. Charlene couldn’t keep Toby and tried to place him with friends before taking him to the Aiken County Animal Shelter. The FOTAS volunteers assured her he would be well cared for until a suitable owner could be found.
 In the meantime, we were ready to adopt a dog into our family. We didn’t want a puppy, but we did need a smaller dog because of the size of our backyard. In early March, we met Toby shortly after he was brought to the shelter and we instantly fell in love. We proceeded with the adoption and posed for a picture to be placed on the FOTAS Facebook page. As luck would have it, a mutual friend saw the picture and told Charlene.
 We connected and she shared the sad story of how she found him. Her insight helped us to understand some of his anxiety issues.
 Our first days with Toby were a learning curve for all of us. He didn’t know how to play with toys nor was he leash trained. His fear of other dogs and people left him shaking and very anxious.
 A visit to Dr. Holly Woltz provided us with some tools to socialize Toby and help him live his best life. Today, Toby loves his daily walks. He nuzzles all of the dogs in the neighborhood and happily greets their owners. His favorite friend is Luna, a very large black dog who is equally happy to see our little Toby. As for toys, he loves to play fetch with his pink elephant.
 The story of Toby culminates in much the same way as in the play when Annie sings with Daddy Warbucks, “I Don’t Need Anything But You.” Toby is in his forever home and brings us much joy. We even have his picture on this year’s Christmas card. He completes our family and we are grateful to Charlene and our friends at FOTAS for bringing us together.

If 2020 has been a year of shocks, it’s also been a year of surprises. And we suspect that one such surprise for many people is Joe Biden’s approach to taking office next month.
 Even under pressure from the far left of his party, the Democrat from Delaware is taking three distinctive steps to unite the country behind him as he prepares to be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States next month. If he continues on this path, he might just have an opportunity to govern rather than watch his administration crack apart on the rocks of national division.
 It’s far too early, of course, to know how Joe Biden will lead. We’ll have a better idea of his intentions once all of his Cabinet picks are announced and once he stakes out clear budget objectives for the coming year.

The Indian Air Force successfully test-fired the Akash Missiles at Suryalanka test firing range in Andhra Pradesh during the Combat Guided Weapons Firing 2020 exercise to practise different engagement scenarios during conflicts to shoot down enemy planes.


  It has been recently upgraded with a seeker to neutralise targets with less effort than before, with the upgraded version capable of engaging with targets at very high altitude locations too.


  Manufactured by Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), designed and developed by the DRDO, Akash is one of the most successful, indigenously made missiles inducted into the Indian Army and Air Force. The missile has the capability to engage aerial threats upto the maximum range of 25 km and up to an altitude of 18 km, operating at a speed range of 1.8 to 2.5 Mach.


  BDL, along with DRDO, is geared up for delivery of Akash Prime to Indian Army with seeker and high altitude capability. This capability to meet the user requirements has been achieved in a short span.

SUMMIT PARK, Utah (AP) — A novice pilot from Idaho safely landed his small airplane on a Utah interstate after its engine failed midflight. Jackson Walker of Idaho Falls was flying with a friend to Provo when the single-engine aircraft's oil pressure dropped about an hour-and-a-half into the Saturday night flight, the Deseret News reported. He began looking for an alternate landing strip when the engine seized up. Walker realized he wouldn't make it to an airport, he said, so he brought the Cessna aircraft down on Interstate-80 east of Salt Lake City. The landing was aided by a Good Samaritan driving on the interstate who slowed other traffic to give Walker adequate space to land, he said. The self-described “newly minted private pilot” who started flying in June said he was nervous but stuck with the flying procedures he'd learned. “It seemed like the rumble strip was the bumpiest part,” he said Walker. No one was injured. Utah Highway Patrol trooper Alex Agin called it the “best-case scenario” for an aircraft making an unexpected landing on a freeway. “It was a landing, it’s not a crash,” he said.

In Maurice Maeterlinck’s delightful fantasy-drama, The Bluebird, there is a scene in which the unborn souls of children wait in heaven for some human father and mother who will take the risk of becoming parents, who will let the children be born. In the scene, it is the appointed time for certain souls to leave God’s realm and to dwell on earth, but some are reluctant to be born. “No, I don’t want to go! I would rather not be born. What if I am not loved after I am born? What if my parents abandon me or die and I am left alone? No, I would rather stay here.”
 From those who are being born that day and are leaving God’s realm a song arises,
 ‘The earth! The earth! I can see it! How beautiful it is! How bright it is! How big it is!” Then other beautiful voices are heard singing. “Who are they?” a visitor asks. lilt is the song of the mothers coming out to meet the child they will bear,” the visitor is told.
 Maeterlink is saying that there is a risk in any birth, a risk in the birth of love and loving; and he is right. There are risks in being alive, risks of entering into the new and unfamiliar, risks in embracing the truth and change, risks in loving and being loved, risks in trusting God and living from God’s promises.
 Christmas celebrates the risk of love and birth which God took when He wrapped up divine love and grace in Jesus Christ, born a helpless human baby to Mary and Joseph in a cave/stable outside of Bethlehem. Because God took the risk of birth and love, we can understand more clearly and respond more completely to God’s revelation. In this very human Jesus, we behold a person like us with whom we can identify, a living example we can follow, a compelling presence who understands our human dilemmas and struggles, and whom we can follow with commitment and joy.
 As Van Harvey put it, “Human beings only seem to decide concerning the truth about life in general when they are confronted by a life in particular.” No academic theory, written word, or spoken exhortation convinces or illuminates us as much as a living person who embodies and lives out before our very eyes what we seek to know and become. In Jesus, we behold all we are and all we can yet become. The highest in Jesus’ nature appeals to the highest in our nature.
 As Jesus moves with the integrity of caring love among persons, we begin to realize that such a loving relationship is what God wills and wants to occur with us and between us. Little wonder the apostle John sings, “In him was life, and the life was the light of people. The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it. [And] to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.”
 Yes, because God took the risk of birth of divine love in Christ, we are more fully alive when we take the risk of birth in faith and accept God’s love, when we open ourselves to Christ and let him be born and live in us. As Meister Eckart declared in a sermon on Christmas Eve, “What good is it to me if Mary gave birth to the Son of God, and I don’t give birth to God’s Son in my person and my culture and my times?”
 When we take the risk of birth and let Christ be born in us, we then are moved to risk the birth of love in marriage, in parenthood, in friendship, and in service to others.
 When with courage and trust we take such risks of birth and love, we discover how full and rich life can be, how amazing and exciting love is, how meaningful and full of possibilities and miracles every day is. When we take the risk and Jesus is born in us, life comes alive for us with new dimensions – it becomes a veritable feast! Hear how it happened to Nina Hermann. She was a chaplain at a children’s hospital. She made her daily rounds with compassion and caring, but she was spiritually unsettled as she wrestled with why God allowed innocent children to -suffer.
 One night she was in her apartment, a fire in the fireplace shutting out the cold and the blowing snow of a blizzard. She was reading a book and once again wrestling with why a God of love would allow innocent children to suffer and die so soon. The telephone rang. It was the mother of a young girl who had just been readmitted to the hospital. The mother insisted that Nina Hermann come immediately to the hospital in order to visit her daughter before she died.
 Nina Hermann didn’t want to go. She had been similarly summoned before by this mother, and she knew this could be another false alarm. She selfishly didn’t want to leave the cozy comfort of her apartment and face the storm raging outside.
 But she said, “Yes, I’ll come.” She was not sure why, but part of it was her sense of responsibility and calling. She walked to the hospital through the driving snow and the biting wind, with ambivalent feelings about the mother and daughter and about God, and how unfair it was of God to put her in such an impossible situation – to talk of God’s love with patients and their parents when she doubted it in the face of human suffering.
 She got to the hospital and discovered it was indeed another false alarm. The child was stable and would probably be discharged in the morning. But instead of turning on her heels to return home, Nina Hermann sat down and talked to the young patient’s mother. In the conversation they shared, Nina Hermann verbalized some of the doubts that troubled her.
 She found herself talking about the cross and the suffering of Christ, and about what that means. And as the two women shared together, it suddenly made sense – not only to the chaplain but also to the mother, and nurtured hope in her as she contemplated the ordeal that lay ahead for her and her daughter. Nina Hermann later recorded her thoughts about the nighttime conversation and the entire experience:
 Do what you don’t want to do! Go when you don’t want to go! Plod through the snow, Wrestle with the wind and the cold.
 Go when you don’t want to go, And when you least expect it, You may glimpse an open door of light.
 God took the risk of birth and love and came in Christ to bring us fully alive and to give us eternal life. When we take the risk of birth and let Christ be born in us, when we let God love us, we will find a larger life in a world replete with miracles, beauty, and revelation.
 We shall be called to go, to take the risks of love at the crossroads, to do what we may not want to do, to go when we do not want to go. But in the going and doing, we will meet Jesus and see God in the faces of those we love and serve. And that’s all the assurance we need in this season and always!

We actually convert our Finley’s restaurant into a tacky Christmas bar and restaurant. So, there’s tacky Christmas sweaters by the staff. There’s crazy garland and tinsel and tacky decorations all over the bar. So, it’s one of the favorite places that our guests have to eat during the year. And then throughout the resort you’ll find pop-up bar experiences with cocktails that are made freshly by our mixologists and our food and beverage director, so those are a big hit as well.” A number of the dining experiences come with outstanding entertainment.“The Oak Ridge Boys Christmas and Tennessee Dinner Show this year runs through December 25.

Conobbi Sabu Kohso nel 2008, quando andai in Giappone per il contro-summit G8 che si tenne a Sapporo, nell’Hokkaido. Nato in un’isola del sud dell’arcipelago, e vissuto a Tokyo negli anni della sua giovinezza, Sabu si è poi trasferito a New York dove da un paio di decenni vive traducendo e scrivendo per media giapponesi e statunitensi. Nel luglio del 2008 fu uno degli organizzatori dell’anti-summit, e negli anni successivi siamo rimasti in contatto, e abbiamo anche lavorato insieme a un progetto sulle analogie tra l’estetica novecentesca Italiana e quella giapponese, che spero un giorno riusciremo a riprendere.

The law, called Act 177, was passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov. Henry McMaster in late September. It implements strict rules on the sale, purchase or transfer of native reptiles and amphibians out of South Carolina. It also prohibits the release of nonnative species.
 Authorities say the regulations seek to strike a balance between conservation and allowing enthusiasts to continue collecting some animals from the wild. Along with the law come a slew of new requirements that collectors and animal enthusiasts must meet in order to continue keeping these creatures.
 "This is something that goes back quite a while," said Will Dillman, S.C. Department of Natural Resources assistant chief of wildlife. "In the late 2000s, we had become really aware of large numbers of turtles collected and being sent overseas."
 Some turtles were being kept domestically as pets, but many were being sent overseas, driven by demand as food or use in traditional medicine, Dillman said.
 State lawmakers passed a bill aimed at curbing the removal of turtles from the state, but it left a large loophole — people were still allowed to go into the wild, gather the animals and amass large collections of the reptiles, he said. This gap saw South Carolina emerge as a hub in the illegal wildlife trade. Native species were being scooped up from the wild and outside animals were being brought in.
 People like Steven Baker, who federal authorities identified as the ringleader in the 2014 smuggling case, carved out a lucrative niche in the black market.
 Then 33 years old, the Holly Hill resident pleaded guilty in July of that year to trying to sell South Carolina turtles to a buyer in Florida. That buyer turned out to be an undercover federal agent.

Una confusión le puede pasar a cualquiera, más aún si eres niño. Esta increíble historia llega desde California, Estados Unidos, donde un pequeño dispuesto a tener un nuevo árbol de Navidad en su casa, creyó que el príncipe Harry era un vendedor y no dudó en expresarle todos sus deseos para que este lo ayude a encontrar su preferido. La anécdota no tardó en llegar a las redes sociales, en especial Twitter. Todo se inició en un centro comercial Macy’s de Santa Bárbara, California, hasta donde el duque y la duquesa de Sussex llegaron para hacer sus compras navideñas. Un empleado de ‘Big Wave, Dave’s Christmas Trees & Pumpkin Patch’ presenció toda la escena y la viralizó. Según el relato de James Almaguer, difundido por ‘Daily Mail’ , el príncipe Harry acompañado de Meghan Markle encontraron el árbol perfecto para decorar su villa en Montecito y cuando estaban a punto de pagar su compra se inició la confusión. Una familia y su hijo lograron entrar al establecimiento pese a que el equipo de seguridad de los duques de Sussex había pedido que se despejara el negocio de clientes para que ellos pudieran hacer sus compras sin ser interrumpidos. En un descuido de sus padres, el niño corrió hacia el príncipe Harry y comenzó a preguntarle por los árboles de Navidad, sin saber con quién estaba hablando en realidad. Al notar que lo estaban confundiendo con un vendedor de la tienda, el hijo de Carlos de Inglaterra y nieto de la reina Isabel II reaccionó con gran sentido del humor. “Realmente parecen grandes personas. Meghan parece muy dulce y Harry actuaba como un chico genial. Estoy muy feliz de que les hayan gustado nuestros árboles”, escribió James Almaguer en su cuenta de Twitter. La divertida anécdota marca una de las primeras navidades de la pareja en Estados Unidos. Este 2020 la pasarán junto a su hijo Archie y la madre de Meghan, Doria Ragland, alejados de Reino Unido y la familia real británica.

While Apple is still making bigger phones (just like everyone else) it's the Mini that caught my eye as the first flagship-grade diminutive device to land in ages. So, of course, I had to get one. I'm far from a tiny phone apologist, but I have come to appreciate smaller devices in a roundabout way -- via foldables like the Galaxy Z Flip. Sometimes I like having the extra space to do work, but when I want something for strictly personal non-productive use, a small phone is really nice to have, and the iPhone 12 Mini fits the bill perfectly. It's got that barely-there pocket feel, you can use it one-handed upside down in bed without worrying about it falling on your face, and while you lose some screen real estate, the edge-to-edge screen design and tiny bezels give you the experience of a bigger phone. Compared to the (physically bigger) iPhone SE, the iPhone 12 Mini still has a larger screen.

Margao (Goa) [India], December 6 (ANI): FC Goa bagged their first win in the Indian Super League (ISL) Season 7 as they defeated Kerala Blasters 3-1 at the Fatorda Stadium here on Sunday.   A brace from Igor Angulo (30', 90') and one from Jorge Ortiz Mendoza (52') ensured Juan Ferrando picked up his first win as Goa head coach. Vincente Gomez (90') scored a consolation goal for Kerala.   Ferrando made two changes to the side that was held by NorthEast United as James Donachie and Alexander Jesuraj were included. Nishu Kumar, Gomez and Nongdamba Naorem returned to the starting eleven for Kerala.   The first big chance for the Gaurs arrived early on in the 10th minute when Mendonza beat Nishu to take control of a long ball and fired a shot from outside the box, only to see his effort hit the crossbar.   The home side came close to grabbing the lead once again seven minutes later, only to be denied by the upright. A miscued pass from Rohit Kumar put Angulo through on goal. The striker, with only the keeper to beat, attempted to curl his shot into the bottom corner but it struck the far post.  
 However, Angulo soon made up for the missed opportunity around the half-hour mark as he put Goa ahead. Gama flicked the ball towards Angulo in the box and the striker delightfully dinked it over Kerala goalkeeper Albino Gomes to bag his fourth goal of the season.   Goa returned hungrier after the break and continued to pile on the pressure. Their efforts soon bore fruit as they doubled their lead through Mendoza. The forward received the ball outside the box and traded a lovely one-two with Brandon Fernandes before burying his shot into the far corner.   Kerala pushed hard in search of a goal and came close in the 67th minute. Gomez won the ball inside the box but saw his shot rattle the underside of the crossbar.   Kibu Vicuna's side threatened on quite a few occasions but were unable to find the back of the net. When a goal did arrive for them, the contest had already been settled in Goa's favour. Nishu whipped a cross for Gomez, whose header snuck into the goal after brushing the underside of the crossbar.   Kerala captain Costa Nhamoinesu was given his marching orders late on during injury time after being shown a second yellow card, following a rash tackle on Princeton Rebello. Goa added another goal late in injury time as Angulo pounced on a blunder from Gomez. (ANI)

  In California, the first place to enact a statewide lockdown last spring, new stay-at-home orders were set to take effect Sunday night in Southern California, much of the San Francisco Bay area and other areas.


  Gov. Gavin Newsom said he hopes the new lockdown order is the last one he has to issue, declaring the vaccine offers “light at the end of the tunnel."

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS - Patricia "Gail" Whyte was born March 9, 1940 in Chicago to Harvey and Mary (nee Whalen) Burgie. She died November 24, 2020 at the Lutheran Home in Arlington Heights after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease complicated with progressive aphasia. Gail was a hard worker, a person who always kept herself very busy and made earning a college degree a lifelong mission. After graduating from Wauconda High School in 1958 and a brief stint in college, she took an office job in downtown Chicago. While living in the Northeast for almost 30 years, she earned an Associate's degree and eventually earned her Bachelor's degree from Olivet-Nazarene University after moving back to the Chicago area in the mid-90's. Gail loved theater, was a volunteer usher, performed with the Footlighters in Des Plaines and sang in several singing groups over the years including the Stuart W. Smith Singers of New Jersey in the 1960s and the New Beginnings Chorus in Arlington Heights in the early 2000's. The caring staff of Lutheran Home knew Gail's boundless energy and inability to sit still manifested in her walking the halls greeting everyone in her path. From time to time she also attempted to escape to take herself out to lunch- something she always enjoyed. Gail is survived by her sister, Virginia Moriarity; and by her daughters, Heather (Gregg Hudson) Whyte and Lindsey (Emilio Di Benedetto) Whyte; her adoring grandchildren, Cassidy, Marco and Annabel; many nieces and nephews. She is preceded in death by her sisters, Marjorie Harriet (late Daniel) Bobzin and Barbara (late Frank) DeSimone; and by her parents. Due to COVID 19 restrictions, memorial services will be held at a later date. Gifts in Gail's memory can be made to CureAlz.org or The Harbour in Park Ridge. Funeral information and condolences can be given at www.GlueckertFH.com or 847-253-0168.

The hairs on the back of Gwen's neck really stood up though when locals pointed out that the area around Llanddona was a hotbed for witchcraft and sorcery in the 17th Century.


  According to legend a sinking boat full of men and women struggled ashore at nearby Red Wharf Bay without rudder or oars.


  Afraid of those aboard the boat, the people of Llanddona are said to have driven it back into the sea.


  But one woman, believed to be a witch, leapt ashore and struck the sand with a stick, causing a spring of pure water to burst forth on the sands - leaving locals falling back in horror.


  An agreement was reached and the boat people were all allowed to stay, provided they made their settlement outside the village, not far from the woods where Gwen was walking.


  Two of the Llanddona witches still talked about today and part of that group are Bella Fawr and Siani Bwt who each had four thumbs.


  Legend says the men lived by smuggling, and the women begged and practised witchcraft.

By the end of the 19th century, Christmas ornaments were being shipped from Germany to the United States and the popularity of the Christmas tree tradition was on the rise. In the early 20th century, American families were decorating their trees with homemade ornaments among things, such as apples, nuts, and cookies, and then electricity brought about the use and popularity of Christmas lights. Christmas trees began to appear in homes and town squares across America and this tradition has persisted since.
 Today, it is common for households to possess an artificial tree for various reasons. However, some people still find value in going and selecting a tree to light for Christmas. If you have not yet put up a tree, there is still plenty of time to do so and you can find a selection of Christmas trees for sale in town or at Wilkinson Christmas Forest north of Tahlequah on highway 82.

Ma mancano ancora diversi giorni al 9 dicembre, quando le aule parlamentari dovranno esprimersi attraverso le risoluzioni che accompagneranno il premier Giuseppe Conte al decisivo Consiglio europeo del 10-11 dicembre. E subito dopo la dichiarazione di Berlusconi è cominciato a trapelare il dissenso interno a Forza Italia. I “malpancisti” pronti a non seguire le indicazioni del leader e a votare a favore del nuovo Mes sarebbero addirittura i 2/3 dei parlamentari. Il dibattito interno ai gruppi si fa acceso: isolamento dal centrodestra o isolamento a Bruxelles? Secondo alcuni retroscena, i vertici del Ppe si sarebbero già attivati per far cambiare idea al Cav, o almeno per assicurare un sufficiente numero di “responsabili” in Forza Italia.

“Reading through the various business news platforms tells a story that fraud and corruption are arguably the greatest unmanaged commercial risks of today. I need not go into the infamous high profile cases of financial irregularities revealed by our Auditor General both at the Ministry of Health and Ministry of General Education. One would want to ask if auditors were doing enough to assist management and those charged with governance in seriously addressing these issues, making fraud prevention integral in business strategies and organisations’ core values,” Kashinga said. “It is important that in the midst of these challenges, internal audit executives must take more proactive, action-oriented approaches to all kinds of risks facing organisations. This will call for continuous vigilance and creative thinking in order for internal auditors to remain relevant in the modern business dispensation. There is therefore need for you to equip yourselves with new skills to cope with these changing situations. You should play a crucial role in the enhancement of good public and private sector governance”

Andrea era una persona speciale. Elegantissimo, sempre puntuale al lavoro, garbato, gentile, mai una parola fuori posto. Ho lavorato con lui nei primi anni del 2000 quando assunsi l'incarico di assessore al Commercio al comune di Torre Annunziata. Non ricordo una volta che si sia lamentato o che abbia perso la pazienza di fronte ai tantissimi problemi cui si andava incontro.  Sempre disponibile e pronto a tappare i buchi di una macchina comunale sempre piu in difficolta a causa della carenza di personale. Dall'Ufficio Commercio fu trasferito al Settore delle Finanze e ultimamente all'Anagrafe. Per lui l'importante era fare il proprio dovere, dove non aveva importanza.

El Concello de Sada aboga por un convenio entre administraciones y se ofrece a gestionar las visitas. Se trata de una antigua reivindicacion del Ayuntamiento el alcalde, Benito Portela.

That said, iOS _still_ makes it harder for me to do the things I need than Android. The notification system doesn't fit my sort of workflow, iOS makes it too hard to pass many kinds of content between apps, and I still can't even really use the browser I want. Sure, I can change my default to "Chrome," but those quotations are legit; it's just Safari with a Google-flavored skin. Ultimately, iOS still lacks the freedom of Android -- I actually need the extra tools that come with it to do my job, and though I can reproduce those workflows in iOS, it takes ages to come up with what ultimately feels like a half-baked workaround. Apple may be loosening the reins just a bit in recent days, but there's a long way to go before it can do everything Android does. But iPhones also get _years_ more updates than Android phones, which is a big point in their favor.
