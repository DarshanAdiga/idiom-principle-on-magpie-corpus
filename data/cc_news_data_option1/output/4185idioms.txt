It ripped through the nursing home in Wessington Springs where both his parents lived, killing his father. The community’s six deaths may appear minimal compared with thousands who have died in cities, but they have propelled the county of about 2,000 people to a death rate roughly four times higher than the nationwide rate.
 Rural counties across Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana sit among the top in the nation for new cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. In counties with just a few thousand people, the number of cases per capita can soar with even a small outbreak — and the toll hits close to home in tight-knit towns.
 “One or two people with infections can really cause a large impact when you have one grocery store or gas station,” said Misty Rudebusch, the medical director at a network of rural health clinics in South Dakota called Horizon Health Care. “There is such a ripple effect.”
 Wessington Springs is a hub for the generations of farmers and ranchers that work the surrounding land. Residents send their children to the same schoolhouse they attended and have preserved cultural offerings like a Shakespeare garden and opera house.
 They trust Dean, who for 42 years has tended to everything from broken bones to high blood pressure. When a patient needs a higher level of care, the family physician usually depends on a transfer to a hospital 130 miles (209 kilometers) away.
 As cases surge, hospitals in rural communities are having trouble finding beds. A recent request to transfer a “not desperately ill, but pretty” sick COVID-19 patient was denied for several days, until the patient’s condition had worsened, Dean said.
 “We’re proud of what we got, but it’s been a struggle,” he said of the 16-bed hospital.
 The outbreak that killed Dean’s dad forced Wessington Springs' only nursing home to put out a statewide request for nurses.
 Thin resources and high death rates have plagued other small communities. Blair Tomsheck, interim director of the health department in Toole County, Montana, worried that the region’s small hospitals would need to start caring for serious COVID-19 patients after cases spiked to the nation’s highest per capita. One out of every 28 people in the county has tested positive in the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers.
 “It’s very, very challenging when your resources are poor — living in a small, rural county,” she said.
 Infections can also spread quickly in places like Toole County, where most everyone shops at the same grocery store, attends the same school or worships at a handful of churches.
 “The Sunday family dinners are killing us,” Tomsheck said.

Aberdeen were relentless with their pressing and Hayes shot across the face of goal after Wright had won the ball and set up the wing-back.
 United got a bit of respite in the latter stages of the half but their first corner led to another Dons chance. McLennan broke upfield and set up Wright but Siegrist pulled off another good stop.
 Aberdeen continued to dominate possession after the restart and United brought on Marc McNulty for his debut in a straight swap for Nicky Clark as Wright received treatment following an off-the-ball clash with Connolly.
 The next United change – Liam Smith for skipper Reynolds – saw them switch from a 3-5-2 to a 4-4-2 with Luke Bolton and Peter Pawlett handed more attack- minded wide midfield roles.
 The change had little effect on the balance of play.
 Niall McGinn came on for the Dons and immediately hit a free-kick which Siegrist pushed wide.
 Smith turned behind a Hedges cross which was begging to be converted before United broke from the resulting corner. McNulty’s ball forward sent Shankland away and the Scotland striker set up Chalmers, but Lewis blocked the shot with his foot.

He says the community swarmed to his shop and the children “love it”.
 “If you eat it everyday, obviously it’s bad for you,” admits Mr Litu. “But as nutrition, if you do it once in a while. If you diet for a week, on a strict diet, you crave for more. If you eat fried chicken and someone says you are not allowed to eat fried, your body will crave more fried chicken. You should rather eat it once a week, be moderate instead of eating regularly which is bad for you.”
 Keeping in that spirit, the father-of-two says he no longer eats sugar in a bid to be healthier, but now and then he will have a piece of dark chocolate.
 Mr Litu says the children in Tredworth have nicknamed him ‘The Chicken Man’.
 Hr said: “Kids mostly know me by that name because I am quote well known in the area. The kids, especially the kids, they say it in the street. I love it because they notice me and respect me, and they say hello.”
 The ‘Chicken Man’ also owns Apna Curry Feast in Cheltenham.
 Mr Litu has two young daughters with wife Emroza, who he married in 2014, Tasfia, 5, and Aaizah, 2.
 Aside from two businesses and a young family he somehow finds time to run a children’s football team called the Great Britain Sports Club.
 Mr Litu holds Great Britain dear, he has such a steadfast belief in the country’s strengths that he voted to exit the European Union in the 2016 referendum.

The U.S. Virgin Islands will play its Group C games along with Canada, Cuba and the Dominican Republic in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic on Nov. 29-30. The USVI will face the Dominican Republic on Nov. 29 and Canada on Nov. 30. Cuba will play the Dominican Republic on Nov. 29, and Canada on Nov. 30.
 Group C currently has a four-way tie among its teams, each having a 1-1 record. The USVI split its two first-round games against Cuba, winning the opener 80-64 on Feb. 21 in Havana, but losing the rematch three days later, 91-64 at the University of the Virgin Islands’ Sports and Fitness Center on St. Thomas.
 Under the qualifying format, each team in group play faces the other group teams twice, with the top three in each group advancing to the FIBA AmeriCup 2022, which was pushed back a year from its scheduled date because of the coronavirus pandemic and the rescheduling of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.
 “It is an honor to be back playing and allowing for competition around the world,” FIBA Americas executive director Carlos Alves said in a prepared release. “Our National Federations and the entire basketball ecosystem need to compete, so together we continue to develop and promote our game. This upcoming qualifying period for the AmeriCup 2022 will be remembered as the restart of our game and we are extremely happy and excited with the possibilities.”
 Group A (Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Venezuela) and Group B (Brazil, Panama, Paraguay and Uruguay) will both play their next games in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A site for the Group D (Bahamas, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States) has yet to be finalized.
 The final round of group-play games have been tentatively scheduled for Feb. 18-22, 2021.

TUMWATER, Wash. (AP) — A person is in jail after a Washington State Patrol aircraft was hit with a laser light over Tumwater. KING-TV reports the aircraft was helping locate an elderly man Thursday who had wandered away from caregivers when it happened. That man was found Friday morning, according to Tumwater police. It’s the latest incident of a dangerous practice that can have serious consequences, officials said. Lasers can blind a pilot temporarily, making them unable to see their instruments, and even lead to permanent eye damage. Disrupting a pilot is considered a serious threat to air safety. It’s a felony in Washington and violators can also be fined $11,000 per incident by the Federal Aviation Administration. WSP spokesperson Trooper Darren Wright said this was the sixth incident in a month involving the patrol’s aircraft. Like Thursday night, most of the incidents involving WSP aircraft have resulted in an arrest. Planes landing at Sea-Tac International Airport have also been hit with lasers while on final approach over the years.

 Werner then raced into the box, cut across the face of goal and still found time to add a fine finish.
 For a maiden Premier League goal, this was something special – and entirely in keeping with Chelsea’s expectations of their big-money summer signing.

"articleBody" : "Virat Kohli once again made a special statement for AB de Villiers after the former South African skipper led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) to a superb seven-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020 on Saturday. Chasing RR's target of 178, de Villiers remained unbeaten on 55 from 22 balls. He hammered the RR bowlers at a strike-rate of 250 as his match-winning knock was inclusive of six sixes and a four. RCB needed 35 off the final two overs. When RR's Jaydev Unadkat came to bowl the 19th over, de Villiers was on the strike. 'Mr.360' smashed the first three deliveries for three sixes and at the end of the penultimate over, RCB needed 10 more to seal the match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. With five needed off the last three balls of the final over, de Villiers struck a six to clinch a very important win for RCB, who remained in the top four of the IPL 2020 points table. Speaking at the post-match presentation, a delighted Kohli heaped praise on de Villiers, terming him the 'most important match-winner in the IPL'. De Villiers now has scored 285 runs in nine innings at 57 in the ongoing edition of the IPL. In the most runs- chart, de Villiers is placed seventh, while Kohli is No. 4, having scored 347 runs in nine matches at an average of 57.83. 'Importance has been getting points on board. Was a very important game because it's three days now till we play again. If we have to be honest, you are tense because you're not sure how many balls he will face. When he plays like that you want him to face every ball, no offence. Always bats by situation. He always looks at the team situation. In my eyes, he's the most important match-winner in the IPL. Purely because of the presence of that man in the middle the opposition feels we're not out of the game. Young Dev has come in and has batted beautifully. Finch has made an impact at the top. We understand the dynamics. The bowling has stepped up this season. Guys have come back strongly when put under pressure. Saini has been brilliant. Chahal. Isuru has bowled well,' added Kohli, who is the only player to have scored over 5,500 runs. RCB have a three-day break before they take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Wednesday at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi. RR, who are placed seventh in the IPL 2020 table, also travel to Abu Dhabi next to face Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Monday.",

Team anointment at the national championships is a distinct possibility for at least one member curling association as it considers options for an uncertain season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The Northern Ontario Curling Association said Thursday that a final decision on its competitions has not been made, but the fate of its playdown season was "bleak."
 If it remains unsafe to host bonspiels in its region, the NOCA said, the "results of the most previously completed competition" will be used to determine representation at national events like the Scotties Tournament of Hearts and Tim Hortons Brier.
 In such a scenario, that would mean reigning champions Team Krista McCarville and Team Brad Jacobs would get the spots.
 "Because we haven't had a competition since the last one, they still are our Northern Ontario champions," NOCA executive director Bobby Ray said from North Bay, Ont. "If there's an event that calls for those people to come forward and represent our territory, that's the way we've thought about it."
 Elite curling competitions have started to resume in recent weeks on a more regional level due to travel restrictions.
 Several top events, including four Grand Slam stops, have been cancelled and decisions on top domestic events set for early 2021 have not been made.
 Original plans to hold the Scotties in Thunder Bay, Ont., in February and the Brier in Kelowna, B.C., in March have been all but officially dashed due to the pandemic. A hub city concept is being considered but nothing has been finalized.
 A Curling Canada spokesman said the federation is working on a number of different options and hopes to announce something soon.
 Gerry Peckham, Curling Canada's high-performance director, said playdowns in provinces and territories may not have a traditional setup this season due to the pandemic.
 "It might be doable in one province and not in another," he said in a recent interview from Ottawa. "So they'll have to come up with some alternative mechanism to, if so inclined, to declare a team.
 "But there are lots of forums now occurring at the provincial level behind closed doors, as provincial associations in consultation with health authorities try to determine where the guardrails would be on a province attempting to do a provincial championship in some way."
 Fields at the Scotties and Brier are primarily filled with winners from provincial and territorial playdowns held beforehand. Some provinces have zone and regional qualifiers before their championships too.
 Ashley Howard, the executive director of Saskatchewan's curling association, said the possibility of declaring entries is on CurlSask's radar, but she's hopeful the provincial championships set for Estevan, Sask., will proceed as scheduled.
 "If at all possible we want to run our competition as planned and in our facility as planned, which would be a 12-team triple knockout," she said from Regina. "I certainly hope that we don't have to come to any other drastic measures. But things are changing so quickly.
 "I don't know what things are going to look like this afternoon, let alone at the end of January."
 With travel restrictions changing regularly and COVID-19 cases fluctuating throughout the country, there is no firm gameplan for these next few months.
 "I'm happy with our (method)," Ray said. "It's not going to make everyone satisfied. But I can sleep at night with the rationale that we've walked through, that we have defending champions at the moment."
 Ray noted that the majority of health units in his region have recommended that curling be limited to play among cohorts and that competitions be suspended for now.
 With about half of the association's member clubs not planning to open until 2021, it would be difficult to stage a true championship for the entire region anyway, he said.
 “If we were forced to make a decision today, sadly, all competitions would be cancelled for the season."
 The Northern Ontario championships were originally set to be played in late January in Kenora, Ont. Dates, locations and formats for all events are "back on the table," the NOCA said, with no competitions to be held before January.
 The Scotties and Brier both use 16-team fields with entries from each of the 14 provincial and territorial associations. Defending champions return as Team Canada and there is also a Team Wild Card.
 Manitoba's Kerri Einarson won the Scotties last season and Brad Gushue of Newfoundland and Labrador won the Brier.

A share of the spoils means Everton remain three points clear of their city rivals at the top of the table.
 Liverpool were smashed 7-2 by Aston Villa in their last game before the international break, but started like a side keen to make amends.
 Mane missed the Villa Park mauling after testing positive for coronavirus and the Senegalese showed why he was badly missed with a smart finish from Andy Robertson's cut-back to open the scoring.
 Everton had a major let off moments later when Virgil Van Dijk was on the receiving end of a dangerous late lunge from Jordan Pickford as a free-kick was swung into the box.
 However, no penalty was awarded on a VAR review because Van Dijk had been marginally offside and Pickford also incredibly avoided a red card.
 Ancelotti's men made the most of that reprieve to level on 19 minutes when Michael Keane's header from James Rodriguez's corner had too much power for Adrian.
 But it was Liverpool who remained the more dangerous side for the remainder of the first-half. Pickford leapt to his right to make a stunning save from Trent Alexander-Arnold's free-kick before Mane then had a similar chance to the opening goal only to this time skew Robertson's cross wide.
 Dominic Calvert-Lewin's nine goals have been a major part of Everton's flying start to the season, but the newly-capped England international missed a huge chance to put the home side in front as he failed to connect with Lucas Digne's low cross five minutes into the second-half.
 James has been a player reborn since his move from Real Madrid to join up with Ancelotti at a third club and the Colombian's sumptuous cross nearly teed up Richarlison for the winner, but the Brazilian's header came back off the outside of the post.
 Those chances looked set to come back to haunt Everton as a moment of magic from Mohamed Salah put Liverpool back in front 18 minutes from time.
 Alexander-Arnold's cross was cut out by Yerry Mina but broke to the Egpytian on his left and he arrowed a shot into the far corner for his sixth goal in five appearances this season.
 Pickford kept Everton in the game with an incredible save from Joel Matip's header and then to parry another piledriver from Salah.
 That proved crucial as Calvert-Lewin produced an incredible leap and header from Digne's cross to level once more.
 Everton did finish the game down to 10 men as Richarlison was shown a straight red card for another dangerous lunge, this time on Thiago Alcantara.

Every once in a while, the pacing of 'Black Clover' is a little off. And that's probably the reason why many anime viewers still hate on it. But if we look at the anime as a whole, it has a great storyline, involving some very well-thought-out plot points, along with memorable action scenes. What more can you ask for from a long-running shounen?

“Like most Police Officers, I’ve experienced my fair share of trauma, violence, upset, injury and grief.
 “We deal with it, take it on the chin and keep going because that’s our job. But we’re still human and the impact this has shouldn’t be underestimated.

 Mr Bailey spent two weeks in intensive care after he was poisoned, during which time his wife and two daughters feared he would die.
 He made a third attempt to go back to work in June this year, describing how he “couldn’t deal with being in a police environment” after efforts to return in September 2018 and in January 2019.
 The Skripals survived the attack but the incident later claimed the life of Dawn Sturgess after she came into contact with a perfume bottle believed to have been used in the attack and then discarded.

Within all this entanglement, this poses a challenge to the proper functioning of the federal system which is worsening from time to time. A smooth functioning of a federal system is when both levels of the federation go hand in hand and whenever there is an entity that defies this functionality disrupts its smooth flows, Getachew says.

To date, the Virgin Islands has recorded 41 homicides, including four classified as vehicular deaths. The cause of death of another victim, a 22-month old child, was listed as child abuse. Of the 36 knife or gun-related killings, one was attributed to an act of self-defense with just six others solved to date.
 In comparison, the British Virgin Islands has recorded two killings, the first of which occurred nine months into the year. Earlier this week, the Royal Virgin Islands Police Force solved one of the cases — arresting a 37-year-old ex-convict and charging him with the Sept. 2 killing of George “Shalala” Borrows, 54, inside the victim’s home.
 Last year, there were 31 homicides recorded in the Virgin Islands. That year, there were six recorded in the BVI. And two years prior, only 10 killings — the most in a decade to be recorded in that community.
 There’s no simple way to gauge why crime remains on the rise in the Virgin Islands, but it’s worth noting it is happening mostly on St. Thomas and St. Croix. On St. John, homicides are few and far between.
 It’s time we find out the cause behind the huge disparity if we’re to help save young men — ages 18-29 — and increasingly young women, from being felled by bullets. Misguided legislation to establish an office of gun violence won’t help, as this merely adds another level of bureaucracy to an already understaffed V.I. Police Department. The homicides not only put our safety at risk, but severely deplete resources that could be used, say, toward rehabilitation of those serving time at the Youth and Rehabilitation Center.
 According to estimates by Luis and Schneider hospitals, every gunshot victim costs each facility roughly $768,000 and more than $1 million if flown off- island.
 Ironically, Kadiyen Illidge died during the month victim advocates march to bring awareness to senseless gun violence. It’s our fervent hope that those with information that could help police find and arrest her killer will come forward.
 Meantime, we’re heartened by St. Croix Police Chief Sidney Elskoe’s pledge to use the department’s resources “in pursuit of justice for these victims” following Illidge’s death and multiple shootings around the island. His counterpart in the St. Thomas-St. John District, Police Chief Steven Phillip, also weighed in on a spate of gun violence that occurred near the time Illidge was killed last week.
 “We cannot continue to have these shootings occurring in our small community,” he said. “We can find other ways of resolving our differences.”
 The V.I. Police can do its part by getting illegal guns off the streets, conducting traffic stops, and updating the public on cases solved, especially when suspects in murder cases have themselves been killed.
 And while we can never bring back Illidge, Chitolie, Rivera and countless others killed, we can say ‘enough is enough’ and mean it by first being the eyes and ears of police and to speak up when needed.
