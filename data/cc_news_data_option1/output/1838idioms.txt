The global liquid bandages market can be segmented based on type of product, distribution channel, and geography. In terms of product, the global market can be categorized into skin protectants and tissue adhesives. Skin protectants are over the counter (OTC) liquid bandages available in gel and spray forms. These are extensively used to protect cuts and scrapes, calluses, and dry and cracked skin. Skin protectants dry rapidly on application and form a tough waterproof protective layer thus, preventing infection at the site of injury. The skin protectants segment is projected to hold a dominant share of the global liquid bandages market by 2026. The tissue adhesives, also known as suture replacements, are used for the closure of chronic wounds and to join serious skin lacerations. Tissue adhesives are also used to close surgical incision after a surgery and repair cuts to internal organs. The tissue adhesive segment is projected to expand at a considerable CAGR during the forecast period. Based distribution channel, the global liquid bandages market can be divided into hospital pharmacies, retail pharmacies, and online pharmacies. The retail pharmacies segment is likely to hold a dominant share of the market by 2026.
