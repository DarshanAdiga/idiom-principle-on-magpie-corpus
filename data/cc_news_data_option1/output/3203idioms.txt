If this pandemic has done anything — other than kill more than 166,000 Americans during a span of six months — it exposed the inequities of an economic system that favors the privileged.
 The congressional stalemate stemming from the debate about the amount and type of relief required to assist Americans impacted by the novel coronavirus and economic fallout caused by a lack of leadership is the most recent example of these inequities. Congressional Republicans, who carry the torch for cutting taxes and reducing regulatory oversight, are blocking assistance for the 15.5 million displaced workers while pushing policies that distribute trillions of dollars to businesses and corporations.
 Those who push policies that exacerbate economic inequities cry foul when any thought is given to an extension of unemployment benefits or the moratorium on evictions for those who are risk of being tossed out on the streets. They balk about the infusion of funds for the U.S. Postal Service, upon which Americans rely for the timely delivery of life-saving prescriptions, payroll and benefits checks and other necessities.
