Legrá's animated performance electrifies the episode as her emotions dramatically pivot between boundless good spirit and rage against her husband's misogyny. This energy fully manifests itself near the end of the film as Tomás confronts Lucía at her new job at a salt flat. As he approaches, she stares him down until finally telling him to get lost. Tomás ignores her pleas, finally forcing Lucía to simply run away from him. Sixties' pop music plays as we watch a long shot of Lucía outrunning Tomás, her hat flying away as she out-sprints him. Eventually her female workers hold his arms back to contain him. Lucía tells him that she never wants to see him again as she cries in rage, "Go away or I might kill you."
 Although one would perhaps consider this a good place for the film to end, _Lucía_ continues, suggesting that both characters are stuck in their old, outmoded ways. Despite her better judgment, Lucía decides to return to Tomás, falsely believing that she cannot live without him. But as soon as she confesses this to him, Tomás reverts to his reactionary ways, demanding she no longer work. He yells, "I love you, Lucía, but you have to obey me, damn it."
 This absurd dance between abuse and love continues as the film's final sequence cuts a young girl distantly observing the couple fight. She appears out of nowhere as she witnesses Lucía running away from Tomás yet again. The final shot shows her laughing as pop music plays across the soundtrack. She looks at the camera, laughing, a comment of the younger generation upon the older generation's stupidity, follies, and ideological hang ups. She turns around and leaves them, a couple from a bygone age, tossed into the scrapheap of history as the younger generation wisely turns to reject their elders' stupidity.
 Not only is _Lucía_ the most engaging film in this boxset, but it also provides some relief by featuring a story centering upon women, even if written and directed by men. It combines all the best elements of the collection: engaging acting, an ambitious storyline, an experimental style, humor and tragedy, and a political through line that weaves itself within individual lives and collective endeavors.
 Indeed, _Lucía_ represents the best of the hidden treasures that the World Cinema Project has repeatedly uncovered. One can only hope that the next installment might actually include some women behind the camera, too, in order to expand the terrain of what is considered truly worth preserving and introducing to a wider public.

With both Ndombele and Lo Celso extremely good on the ball, having a keen eye for a pass and able to create chances for their teammates, the likes of Bale, Son and Kane could thrive playing in front of them.
 Having two creative midfielders in the team really could work wonders for Spurs and that has been the case for Aston Villa since the start of the campaign in September.
 Staying up on the final day of last term by a single point after recording a draw at West Ham, Dean Smith's team have really kicked on and are now sixth in the league table after five wins from their first seven games.
 The club's summer transfer activity has been a major reason for their upturn in form, most notably the arrival of Ross Barkley from Chelsea on a season- long loan deal.
 Compared to Paul Gascoigne and Michael Ballack in the past after bursting onto the scene at Everton as a youngster, the 26-year-old's progress has slowed down over the past couple of years after a mixed time at Chelsea.

We might be heading into the festive season, but it looks like Love Island bosses are already thinking about summer.
 In fact, ITV bosses are now planning to cast a whole new bunch of singletons to enter the villa for the seventh series in May.
 According to reports, they will be sifting through the applications of thousands of young people as early as January.
 A source told The Sun: “Reality shows can now have huge casts living together as long as all participants and crew have isolated for two full weeks beforehand, as well as having regular ­temperature testing both on and off- set.
 “Obviously there’s always an element of risk but ITV bosses feel it’s time to get the Love Island cogs turning, with a view to it being made in early summer.”

I can't help but marvel that one of the United States' most prominent unofficial film ambassadors had once broken his directorial chops working for B movie maestro Roger Corman and consumed enough cocaine in his youth to send him hurtling to an emergency room with bleeding eyes and nostrils (Peter Biskind, _Easy Riders, Raging Bulls_ , p. 386, 1999). __ But such humble origins are what the myths of America are built upon.
 Martin Scorsese has traveled a long distance since those chaotic, drug-induced days of yore. For the past 13 years, Scorsese spearheaded the World Cinema Project, an organization tasked with restoring both famous and relatively obscure cinematic works of art of the past. The project is labor intensive in tracking down adequate prints of the films and painstakingly restoring them to relatively pristine conditions. A small fraction of these newly preserved works are highlighted in select boxsets produced by Criterion. Some true gems have been restored such as Kim Ki-young's _The Housemaid_ (1960), Djibril Diop Mambéty's _Touki Bouki_ (1973), Apichatpong Weerasethakul's _Mysterious Object at Noon_ (2000), and Edward Yang's _Taipei Story_ (1985). The boxset is currently in its third iteration and also contains a few magnificent restorations.  
 But before discussing the collection's high points, there are ways in which the boxset has consistently been plagued with certain limitations of a New Hollywood outlook, dictated by the cultural moment when Scorsese received his film training and the waters he swam in within Tinsel Town at the time. As film historians like David E. James have repeatedly pointed out, despite how the rise of the film "brat generation" of the 1960s and 1970s might have challenged narrative form and expanded film content, they were decidedly negligent about gender both in terms of representations on the screen and employing women behind the scenes.

Change does not come swiftly to the _Times._ Readers were distressed to wake up on Election Day and find out that the paper was bringing back its infamous needle, and the days that followed were filled with recriminations about how the _Times_ had kept readers in a bubble — never mind that the warnings about the shifting Cuban vote in Florida and the lengthy vote-tabulating process ahead were there in the news pages for anyone who had taken the time to look there, rather than feeding themselves another dose of the “Opinion” section. The paper attracted more readers to its website than ever before. As its journalists got to the task of narrating the end-stage of the most extraordinary period of American history in living memory, Joe Biden was promising to bring the two Americas back together. The _Times_ had become the paper of the resistance, whether or not it wanted the distinction. The months ahead will determine whether it can again become the paper of record.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.
 There have been signs throughout the 2020 NFL season that good things are to come for the Carolina Panthers.
 It might not be this year, it may not even be next year. But there has been plenty to encouraged by from what Matt Rhule and his coaching staff have done with this team.
 That was evidenced yet again in a 33-31 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 9. A team the Panthers on paper had no business being competitive with for 60 minutes, but ended up being a game the 3-6 team was in until the very end.
 The Panthers' offense had one of its best games of the season and it was also the first game that coordinator Joe Brady called from the field instead of his typical box position. Coincidence?
 "I think Joe (Brady) has been itching to be on the sideline. I know he says it's much calmer up in the booth, but just having Joe on the sideline, his calm demeanor, he was always even-keeled throughout the course of the game; so that was good to see, that was good for me," Panthers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater said. "We were able to communicate, instead of having to get on the headset, he's able to see the game at field level, he was able to go down and talk to the offensive line, talk to the receivers and things like that."
