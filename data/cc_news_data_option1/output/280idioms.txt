Monticello Fire and Rescue has a new chief. The city council voted unanimously on Jan. 13 to appoint longtime firefighter and previous assistant chief John Rupkey to the post.
 He replaces Rick Dubson, who retired at the end of 2019.
 “John has a wonderful background,” said Mayor Larry Stoner. “He’s been a firefighter for the City of Monticello since 1996, and has been assistant fire chief 2010 to the present.”
 Rupkey has also completed Firefighter II training, fire responder and EMR training. He works as a pharmacist and has additional medical training.
 “John, thank you very much for volunteering to take care of this. You are a pillar of the community and I am really looking forward to working with you,” added Stoner.
 Appropriations
 Council members approved the annual appropriations ordinance. The state- mandated document uses the city budget as a base, then adds about 10 percent to make sure enough money is statutorily authorized if needed.
 “The appropriation ordinance serves as the city’s legal spending authority and sets the maximum legal spending limit for the year. The appropriation ordinance is slightly inflated over the adopted fiscal year 2020 budget to allow for unforeseen revenues and/or expenditures,” said City Administrator Terry Summers.
 Holiday decorations
 City council member Pam Harlan was blunt when it came to her opinion on some of the downtown Christmas decorations.
 “I think they’re ugly,” she said, singling out the wreaths that are placed on light poles each holiday season. “They’re nasty.”
 When asked how old they were, Public Works Director Jim Grabarczyk admitted they were “pretty long in the tooth.”
 “I know we’re tried to revamp them, and work with the bulbs, but I think we should try to see what we can do,” added Harlan.
 In other action, the council:
 - was told the next round of Business Bootcamp will begin on Feb. 18. Those wanting to take part can register at www.cityofmonticello.net; and
 –heard from Police Chief John Carter that he would bring a proposed marijuana enforcement fine ordinance to the council at a future meeting. The main reason would be to allow the city to retain revenue gained from fines collected.
 On a related note, Summers said he would be bringing personnel policy changes to the council to account for changes needed due to the legalization of recreational marijuana use.

Hector Bellerin grabbed a last-gasp equalizer for 10-man Arsenal in a 2-2 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday as the visitors recovered from a first-half David Luiz red card to peg back the Blues twice in a pulsating London derby. Top-four chasing Chelsea, seeking to put a stop-start run of performances behind them, started on the front foot and went ahead with a penalty by Jorginho in the 28th minute after Tammy Abraham pounced on a misplaced back pass by Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi and was brought down by Luiz. The Brazilian - whose only other red card in the Premier League came when he was playing for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in 2017 - was dismissed by referee Stuart Attwell before Jorginho stroked home from the spot. Chelsea controlled the first hour of the match with winger Callum Hudson-Odoi hitting the bar and forcing Arsenal goalkeeper Bernd Leno into two fine saves. But they once again failed to turn their possession into more goals and they paid for it in the 63rd minute when Gabriel Martinelli set off on a run from deep in his own half. He skipped past N`Golo Kante as the French midfielder slipped and fired past advancing Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Chelsea, who lost 1-0 on Saturday away to Newcastle United despite also dominating that match, looked stunned at their latest setback before captain Cesar Azpilicueta stabbed home a cross by Hudson-Odoi in the 84th minute. Arsenal refused to give up and their captain Hector Bellerin wrong-footed two defenders to create the space to score three minutes later with a curling low shot. The result left Chelsea in fourth place, six points ahead of Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers who have both played a game less. Arsenal remains in 10th place, 10 points behind Chelsea. Chelsea coach Frank Lampard said his side were still struggling to turn their creativity into goals and had failed to follow their defensive instructions. We re in fourth position which is pretty good, but I know and we know there should be another 10 points on the board at least, Lampard told reporters. All of us need to look at those final details. New Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he told his players at the break that they could weather the storm after Luiz s dismissal. I sensed at halftime that they believed they could get back in the game, he said. I wasn t expecting Hector to score with his left foot.

Nebraska’s defensive game plan for its road game at Wisconsin on Tuesday night was to pack the paint and dare the Badgers to win by shooting from the perimeter.
 Well, that plan backfired in a major way, as UW answered that challenge by knocking down a school-record 18 3-pointers to hand the Huskers an 82-68 defeat.
 Brad Davison and Brevin Pritzl combined for eight made threes and led eight UW players to hit at least one from behind the arc.
 Dachon Burke scored a game-high 20 points with eight rebounds while Cam Mack added 14 points, seven boards, and six assists, as NU shot a solid 43 percent from the field as a team. But it was nearly good enough to keep up with Wisconsin’s red-hot night.

Wap Billing é algo que, com sorte nunca usou. Basicamente uma forma de pagar que permite que, com um clique, alguém associe um pagamento a uma conta de telemóvel. Pior que isso. Permite criar uma subscrição associada ao pagamento da conta do telemóvel, com um clique.
 Foi assim que muitos desprevenidos andaram a pagar meses a fio serviços que nunca quiseram. O sistema foi elogiado como uma forma de permitir pagamento a quem não podia ou não queria usar um cartão de crédito, uma forma simples de pagamento, por aí fora. Na prática, e isto é reconhecido pelos operadores, prestava-se demasiado a fraudes. Basta clicar num botão (até um animal o poderia fazer) para que o operador aceite cobrar mensalmente um serviço para uma entidade terceira que diz prestar um serviço normalmente de entretenimento. Sem assinaturas, sem confirmações, sem cartões, sem complicações. Nunca entendi essa lógica e acontecia algo parecido com serviços de valor acrescentado subscritos por sms. Mas ela funcionava.
 Há uns bons anos uma pessoa veio ter comigo muito aflita porque tinha subscrito um serviço e não sabia como deixar de pagar. O que era? Tinha aceite pagar uma subscrição para lhe dizerem via telemóvel os nomes das suas vidas passadas, diz bem do alvo deste tipo de serviço. Infelizmente há muitas pessoas menos preparadas para lidar com o primeiro aldrabão disposto a usar todas as armas que a tecnologia tem para facilitar o assalto à sua carteira.
 Mas os fornecedores de serviços e o Estado não deviam facilitar tanto a tarefa. Nem vou entrar aqui na confusão legal de quem tem que regular cada tipo de serviço. Vem isto a propósito de finalmente a NOS ter decidido, e foi o primeiro, cancelar os serviços de Wap Billing depois de muitos avisos, de saber perfeitamente qual o seu uso, e de reconhecidamente ter tido cerca de 800 queixas, se for como é habitual, uma pequena parte das vítimas.
 Tardio, mas bem. Outros operadores, a acreditar nas declarações que li, estão agora a pensar fazer o mesmo. Será o fim da fraude? Já ninguém vai compensar os burlados.

“Unfortunately, (Wisconsin) had a night where the basket looked like the ocean and ours looked like a little thimble up there,” head coach Fred Hoiberg told the Husker Sports Network. “They were hitting everything.”  
 Nebraska (7-12 overall, 2-6 Big Ten) started out hot and made its first four shots, but it followed that by missing six of its next seven attempts while Wisconsin made six 3-pointers in the first nine minutes of the game. An 8-0 run by the Badgers and a four-minute scoring drought by the Huskers resulted in a 24-15 UW lead midway through the half.
 But the script would flip soon after, as Wisconsin suddenly went cold and didn’t score for five minutes, allowing Nebraska to rally with a 10-0 run and take a 25-24 lead with six minutes to go in the half.
 A lay-up at the buzzer by Mack sent the Huskers into halftime down just 39-38, capping close to an ideal first 20 minutes for NU. Mack and Burke combined for 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting, eight rebounds, and five assists in the first half, as Nebraska shot 55.6 percent from the field.
 The downside was that Wisconsin kept the lead by surpassing its season average (7.5) with eight made 3-pointers in the first half alone, with six different players hitting from behind the arc.
 The second half couldn’t have started much worse for Nebraska, as Davison knocked down three 3-pointers to spark a 15-2 run out of the gates and gave Wisconsin its biggest lead yet at 54-40.
 “That was hurtful,” Hoiberg said. “They came out and hit shots, and I thought we had a couple solid looks and didn’t convert. Give them credit.”
 The Badgers would go up by 17 points and it looked as if the rout was on. But freshman Kevin Cross provided some life off the bench and helped NU answer with a 10-0 run that cut the deficit down to 63-58 with just over nine minutes still to play.
 That would be as close as the Huskers would get, however, as the Badgers continued to light it up from behind the arc and responded with a 13-1 run to push the lead back up to 79-62. Nebraska ended up missing 10 of its final 11 shots and didn’t make a field goal for the last 3:28.
 Cross scored 17 points and was 3-of-5 from behind the arc, while junior Thorir Thorbjarnarson added 14 points. Davison led Wisconsin with 14 points, as seven Badgers finished with nine points or more.
 The Huskers will hit the road again on Saturday for a rematch with Rutgers, which handed NU 79-62 beating in Lincoln on Jan. 3. That game is set for a 1 p.m. CT tip on the Big Ten Network.
 “From an effort standpoint, like I told the guys, if we go out there and we battle and we fight and we do it together for 40 minutes, win or lose, I’m going to be proud of them,” Hoiberg said. “That’s what we did tonight. We dug a couple holes where we battled back and kept fighting and we kept going and got ourselves back in that game.
 “Like I said, unfortunately (Wisconsin) just bunched too many of those shots together, and once they got confident, we couldn’t slow them down.”
