Losing ballots found in dumpsters is not the only way mail-in voters could lose their voices. If your signature doesn‚Äôt match your old signature‚Äî you know, the one you signed at 16 on your driver's license even though you can‚Äôt vote until 18‚Äîyour ballot will be disregarded and the vote will not count. If you do not follow the directions on the ballot, such as eligible handwriting, matching to the correct numbers, and properly sealing the ballot, to perfection, your vote will be thrown out. These directions may leave you thinking that everyone can follow them without making a mistake on the ballots, until you remember half of America believes a national pandemic killing over 200,000 Americans is a hoax.
 Aside from Americans making mistakes on their ballots, there is the ever- present threat of international tampering by countries such as Russia and Iran. On Wednesday, Oct. 21, the FBI held a national press conference telling Americans not to fear, but Iran had been able to successfully steal voter information and send harassing and threatening fake emails to millions of Americans.

More than 14 million people in the U.S. suffer from osteoarthritis of the knee, a condition that can cause significant pain and limit physical activity, hindering quality of life. While some may obtain relief from conservative approaches, such as medications or injections, others must opt for joint replacement surgery, an invasive procedure with excellent outcomes but a prolonged recovery.
 A new, minimally invasive procedure now available at UCLA holds promise for those who are in pain but not candidates for knee replacement surgery because of age or pre-existing medical conditions. The procedure, genicular artery embolization (GAE), is similar to a technique used to treat uterine fibroids. Sid Padia, MD, director of interventional radiology at UCLA Health, developed the approach based on a similar knee procedure pioneered in Japan in 2017.
 ‚ÄúThe procedure uses advanced imaging guidance and is remarkably straightforward ‚Äì it involves injecting a small volume of tiny particles into the blood vessels that ‚Äòfeed‚Äô the inflamed knee, reducing the blood flow to that area,‚Äù says Padia. ‚ÄúThat in turn reduces swelling and inflammation, resulting in less pain and improved mobility. ‚Äú
 Padia has treated more than 100 patients at UCLA since he started offering GAE in 2018, with 70 percent reporting significant pain reduction and improved mobility.
 Gianni Contardo, a 55-year-old tech manager with severe knee arthritis pain, came to Dr. Padia as he was caught in the middle ‚Äì he had no luck with injections, but at his age, was not a good candidate for a knee replacement given the likelihood that he would need a second replacement or revision after 15-20 years.
 ‚ÄúMy left knee was painful and stiff ‚Äì almost unusable. I used to run and hike a lot, but had to stop. Squatting and bending were very difficult. It really impacted every aspect of my life, especially since I have a teenage daughter I like to hike and be active with,‚Äù said Contardo.
 Genicular artery embolization is performed as an outpatient procedure and takes about two hours under conscious sedation. Through a small catheter under X-ray guidance, a small volume of particles, tinier than grains of sand, are injected into enlarged arteries in the knee, reducing their size and limiting blood flow to the inflamed, painful area.
 Patients can walk soon after the procedure and go home the same day. No physical therapy or other follow-up treatment is needed. Those who benefit from the procedure report a significant improvement six to eight weeks after GAE.
 ‚ÄúWhile we don‚Äôt yet know why 30 percent of those receiving the treatment don‚Äôt benefit, we do know it doesn‚Äôt make patients‚Äô osteoarthritis pain or inflammation worse,‚Äù says Padia. ‚ÄúAnd based on three years of data, those who do show initial benefit retain that improvement.‚Äù
 According to Padia, there are millions of people in the U.S with severe osteoarthritis who are not adequately helped by conservative treatments and who are either not ready or are poor candidates for knee replacement surgery. The GAE procedure may offer an alternative.
 ‚ÄúThe breakdown of knee cartilage is like the wear and tear of brake pads in your car,‚Äù said Padia. ‚ÄúIf we can reduce the friction and inflammation, we can potentially slow down the deterioration and give OA sufferers ‚Äì some who can barely walk ‚Äì a better quality of life.‚Äù
 UCLA Health will be starting clinical trials later this fall, and the procedure will be more widely available in the U.S. next year. ‚ÄúWord-of-mouth has been spreading. We have treated people from all over the country ‚Äì interventional radiologists and patients alike are optimistic about the benefits the early data has shown,‚Äù said Padia.
 Padia and his colleagues are continuing to explore adaptations that may help more patients benefit from GAE. They have also begun performing the procedure on shoulder and elbow joints with promising results.
 Gianni says the improvement in his quality of life has been drastic; something he did not think possible without surgery.
 ‚ÄúI would say that my knee started feeling better within two weeks with a notable reduction of swelling and stiffness,‚Äù said Contardo. ‚ÄúAfter a few months, I was hiking tough trails with my daughter without pain. I didn‚Äôt know this would be possible ‚Äì I‚Äôm very grateful."

Hollywood star Johnny Depp lost his libel battle with a British tabloid on Monday over allegations that he was a "wife beater."
 Depp, 57, famed for his role in films such as "Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Edward Scissorhands", had sued News Group Newspapers, publishers of _The Sun_ , and one of its executive editors, Dan Wootton, over a 2018 article which stated he had been physically violent towards his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, 34.
 The article also questioned his casting in the "Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them" movie franchise.
 In a ruling on Monday, Justice Andrew Nicol dismissed the Pirates Of The Caribbean star‚Äôs claim, saying NGN had proved what was in the article to be ‚Äúsubstantially true‚Äù.
 The judge said: ‚ÄúThe claimant has not succeeded in his action for libel.
 ‚ÄúAlthough he has proved the necessary elements of his cause of action in libel, the defendants have shown that what they published in the meaning which I have held the words to bear was substantially true.
 I have reached these conclusions having examined in detail the 14 incidents on which the defendants rely as well as the overarching considerations which the claimant submitted I should take into account.‚Äù
 The biggest English libel trial of the 21st century garnered worldwide attention as it unfolded over three weeks in July at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.
 Over the course of three weeks, JusticNicol heard evidence from both Depp and Heard about their tempestuous marriage, alleged affairs, his hedonistic lifestyle and battle with alcohol and drugs as well as their furious rows. Both accused the other of violent outbursts.
 The Pirates Of The Caribbean star denied having been violent to Heard, and claimed the article included quotes from alleged victims of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein in order to ‚Äúfinish his career‚Äù by linking the allegations against him to the #MeToo and Time‚Äôs Up movements.
 NGN defended the article as true and says Mr Depp was ‚Äúcontrolling and verbally and physically abusive towards Heard, particularly when he was under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs‚Äù between early 2013 and May 2016, when the couple split.

 Den svenske stjernespissen har fylt 39 √•r, men markerer seg stadig som en av Europas toppspisser for klubblaget Milan. Og det kan virke som at veteranen er sulten p√• mer.
 P√• Twitter har Zlatan publisert et bilde av seg selv if√∏rt svensk landslagslagsdrakt og kapteinsbind sammen med teksten ¬´Long time no see¬ª.
 Bildet er raskt blitt forsidestoff i svenske nettaviser. Landslagssjef Jan Olof Andersson skal onsdag ta ut troppen til Sveriges tre kommende landskamper, men if√∏lge hans kollega Stefan Pettersson er det ikke noe som tyder p√• at Zlatan kommer med der.
 ‚Äì Jeg har ikke sett bildet. Jeg vet ikke hvorfor han legger det ut. Det f√•r dere prate med ham om. Jeg har ingen anelse, sier Pettersson til Expressen.
 Han legger til at han ikke har h√∏rt noe om at Zlatan har v√¶rt i kontakt med forbundet om et mulig comeback.
 ‚Äì Nei. Vi kan ikke bruke energi p√• hva som legges ut i sosiale medier av ulike folk. Vi jobber med landslaget og de kommende kampene i neste uke. Jeg har ingen kommentar til dette.

It is the eve before the US electionThe market has plenty to digest ahead of tomorrow, with a fresh lockdown in the UK also weighing on things following last week's announcements by Germany and France.For now, equity traders are perhaps taking one final lap out to "enjoy the sun" before all the volatility kicks in later this week and all the potential uncertainty beckons.That said, I'd argue that risk positioning is still on the more cautious side after having seen the declines in stocks last week with the S&P 500 having kept below its own 100-day moving average @ 3,307.88 on Friday.S&P 500 futures are now up by ~0.8% while European equities are keeping firmer as well across the board. The DAX is up by ~0.7% currently as well.However, not all is looking bright in the market, as the prospect of lockdown measures is weighing heavily on oil prices. WTI was down by over 4% earlier but has trimmed losses slightly from around $34.10 earlier in the session to $34.85 currently.Meanwhile, Treasuries are looking rather disinterested and in the currencies space, the dollar is keeping slightly firmer with USD/JPY hovering just under 105.00 while EUR/USD was pushed lower earlier to test support around the region of 1.1612-27.The pound is leading losses though, as we see cable sellers try to contest the 100-day moving average @ 1.2878.

When I attended a class on Interior Design, I became aware of space as a canvas to be filled with textiles, 3D shapes, color, and personal expression; and what I learned, I could apply to my own home.
 All of this because I simply attended a few courses at the Adult School.
 These days especially, we all need to break out of our lockdown confinements -- physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. We live in unsettled times, inundated with often bleak news about the coronavirus, riots in our cities, a struggling economy, and fractious politics. We deal with job insecurity or job loss, and an overall inability to go out and socialize as Nature intended. Psychologists and sociologists say that it is important to maintain our connectedness by being with others; but lockdowns have prevented us from doing so. We have adapted to virtual lives out of necessity, but we don‚Äôt have to limit these to our jobs or social groups. Education is as much a gift virtually as it ever was in the classroom.
 We can still learn something new, expand our minds, fulfill our dreams, and meet and engage with others through the Adult School! This fall‚Äôs courses cover as much as they always have, including the arts, technology, culture, current events and history, dance, fitness, languages, health, genealogy, cuisine, photography and so much more. There are in-person trips and tours available as well.
 The Adult School fulfills another critical need for us in the community, especially given the social and economic ramifications of COVID-19. By providing education at minimal cost, it levels the playing field for those who want or need to expand their job skills but cannot afford to take courses at a college or university. One of the courses I teach, American Accent Training, for example, costs only a fraction of what it would be on a college campus and much less still for one of the online programs offered on the Internet.
 The vast array of arts and crafts classes may not only bring joy but may help one develop a new career or expand a current business. The Adult School‚Äôs computer and business classes could provide the necessary skills and knowledge that are required of careers in those industries. At the Adult School, these courses are much less expensive than those offered elsewhere. Language and English as a Second Language (ESL) classes provide the assistance needed to compete in business where one otherwise could not, at little or no cost. And, because the classes are virtual, you are not limited by distance and time.

PEORIA -- For restaurant and bar owners, there was more on the table Sunday than chicken, pie or your favorite adult beverage.
   
 A third straight day of positive COVID-19 rolling averages above the Illinois Department of Public Health threshold has triggered tighter mitigations for Region 2 which includes the Peoria area.
   
 Starting Wednesday, restaurants and bars cannot have indoor service. That put compliance on the menu.
   
 "To be honest, I don't know what our level of compliance is going to be," said Tom West, who owns West Dublin Pub in Pekin. "If we get shut down for non- compliance, or if we are forced to shut down because we can't continue this way financially, either way it's the same end for us."
   
 The Illinois Department of Public Health on Sunday released the latest numbers, which show the region's seven-day rolling average to be 9.3%, well above the 8% threshold.
   
 "We felt like we were just getting back up to par," Gil's Supper Club owner Cindy Smith said. "Now we're back to square one."
   
 Smith says her popular Hanna City restaurant will fill carryout orders with curbside service from 4-8 p.m. starting Wednesday.
   
 "There are a lot of people in our industry who are thinking about rebelling," she said. "I was just in Missouri, at a restaurant, and the tables were inches apart and the place was full. Different regulations in every state. I'm so used to limited seating and distances that I actually turned around and left that Missouri place. I was afraid to risk bringing (COVID) back to Illinois.
   
 "It's been a tremendous burden for all of us. I feel like I've opened eight restaurants this year. We're one of the lucky ones in that we've had a great carryout business."
   
 Jimmy's Bar, in West Peoria, will try to operate on its outside patio for a while.
   
 "We can stay open, but when it gets cold?" owner Jimmy Spears said. "We're in survival mode. It's either stay open or your livelihood is gone. I've gotten PPP loans, and we're OK for now.
   
 "I'm not a health care professional, so we'll do what they say. The whole country is facing this."
   
 West was born and raised in Pekin and spent eight years as a contractor for the Department of Defense in Afghanistan and two more years in Kuwait. He came home in 2017 to chase a dream with his wife opening their own place, West Dublin Pub.
   
 "We opened in June 2018, so we're still in that critical initial three-year period where you have to get established," said West, 45. "I have an indoor patio with four garage doors built into it that we can raise to create 'outdoor' seating. But I'd have to run my heating full blast in the place. I don't know if that can work for us.
   
 "We're faced now with operating with no indoor bar service, no food service, no bar stools, no indoor seating. It's pretty silly, really."
   
 West said the heart of his business is Scotch and high-end liquor. Maybe 10% of the profit comes from food service.
   
 In general, the new restrictions limit gatherings to 25 people, instead of 50, according to a list of rules and regulations listed as mitigations by the governor's office. For restaurants and bars, certain heated tents won't count as outside space, according to Monica Hendrickson, the Peoria City/County Health Department administrator.
   
 "A tent with a heater and all four walls down is considered INSIDE," she said in an email. "What (defines) a tent inside/outside is the number of sides down. Two sides must be open for ventilation."
   
 Peoria County administrator Scott Sorrell urged compliance and striking a balance between the business and health care communities.
   
 "We urge compliance and smart, sensible actions by the public and our business owners," he said.

So, aside from potential issues like people throwing your votes in the trash or not writing the same as 16-year-old you, there is now the possibility Iran is going to vote for you and decide our next president from your email‚Äîgreat.
 If that does not make you question the reliability of mail-in ballots, the FBI also mentioned Russia has created fake advertisements pretending to be American Democrats against Biden, all in a lure to get Trump re-elected. Totally normal, safe actions for a presidential election!
 The lines at the polls are long, and some people either have to work on Election Day, do not have a babysitter for their child or do not want to risk the ongoing coronavirus. There are many valid reasons for not being able to vote in person; however, this does not make mail-in ballots the perfect solution. For instance, I requested my ballot the last week of September, and now, the middle of October, about a week and half from the election, my ballot is nowhere to be found. When checking my state‚Äôs website, it says my ballot was delivered to me Oct. 6, almost two full weeks ago. I even called my state‚Äôs election board and the lady on the phone checked their offices and found my empty, unopened ballot sitting right there on her desk. Yet, it was claimed online to have been delivered two weeks ago. Such errors could have cost me my voice in the election.
 No one can truly predict who will win the election. However, one thing is for sure: thousands of American voices will not be heard due to the multitude of errors with the mail-in ballot voting system. The method of mail-in ballots may even completely change the results of the election from reality of public opinion. Mail-in ballots are not safe and cannot be trusted to uphold the values and needs of the American people.

PALMER TWP., Pa. - A new drop-in recovery center in Northampton County provides immediate resources for residents recovering from drug and alcohol addiction.
 The Palmer Recovery Center is located at 2906 William Penn Highway in Palmer Township.
 The center is run through a partnership with the Northampton County Drug and Alcohol Division.
 The director of the center says it's especially important during the pandemic that people fighting addiction know there are centers likes this, where they can walk in for help.
 "What we hope to be is a safe place for people to come if they need to be connected with treatment, if they need to be connected with resources for jobs, housing, then we're the place to go for that," said Maggie Urban-Waala, director.
 The center offers help around the clock. The site has regular business hours and provides on-call services during after hours.

While discussing the quality the Portuguese can call upon, Dier made sure that Lamela received the praise he deserved.
 Lamela played a part in Spurs' first goal, with his clever flick in the build- up to the penalty being awarded to Kane, and then the hard-working Argentine hit the post in the second half with a low shot from outside the box, before he was replaced by Bale.
 "I don't have to speak about the quality of any of them really. Everyone knows the quality those three [Kane, Bale, Son] have and they're all fantastic players and they all have individual quality to create a moment at any time," Dier said.
 "They also have the quality to [connect] with the rest of the team. Gareth's goal was a great ball from [Sergio] Reguilon and he's finished it off. It's great for us to have that type of quality within all areas.
 "I think we have a lot of depth. We also have Steven Bergwijn, Lucas Moura and Lamela who I thought was fantastic today again, the effort he puts in is incredible. We've got a lot of options up front to do different things."
 Bale's goal was his first in a Spurs shirt for seven years, since leaving the club for Real Madrid in 2013.
 "It's great," said Dier. "You'll have to ask him how he feels but I'm sure he feels great to get his first goal. He's up and running again.
 "He's obviously getting his match fitness back and he's looking better and feeling better every time. We're very excited to have him here and obviously he's helped the team massively today."
