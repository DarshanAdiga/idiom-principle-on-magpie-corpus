NEW YORK (AP) — What passes for a pandemic-era speakeasy these days in New York City isn’t secret at all. On the sidewalks throughout the city, restaurants and bars that have only been allowed to offer takeout orders since March have been bending the rules by setting up outdoor tables and allowing patrons to linger for an extra round or two served through doors and windows. Elsewhere around the city, clothing stores and a tanning salon have tried to reopen early — signs that some New Yorkers are itching to catch up with other parts of the country already freeing up their economies. “It’s been this way more and more each week,” said Levi Nayman, 45, while hanging out outside a piano bar on Manhattan's Restaurant Row one evening, sipping bourbon and listening to Billy Joel’s “Uptown Girl” through outdoor speakers. “It’s better than nothing.” The pop-up bar scene should be viewed as a test run for the official reopening, said Paul Denamiel, owner of the French restaurant Le Rivage, where three bar tables sat lined up along a curb. “We’re sort of doing it now,” Denamiel said. “But we are taking social distancing very seriously.” The scene was the same farther downtown in Chelsea, where young men and women congregated outside bars as masked bartenders passed drinks out the door. A chalkboard at one spot beckoned, “Coffee and cocktails! Frozen watermelon margarita - $10.” In recent weeks, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has given the green light to some upstate New York businesses to reopen with social-distancing and mask- wearing protocols. Not so in New York City, the national epicenter still reeling from more than 20,000 deaths. Cuomo said Friday that some businesses in the city will probably be allowed to start reopening on June 8, but even then...

TRAI has come up with a new recommendation, where the regulator suggested 11 digit mobile numbers as against 10 to increase the user base in the country. The regulator has issued these guidelines under its Ensuring Adequate Numbering Resources for Fixed Line and Mobile Services consultation papers.Switching from 10 to 11 digits with the first digit for mobile number as 9 would give a total capacity of 10 billion numbers, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) said in its new consultation papers. Adding to that, With the current policy of allotment after 70 percent utilization, this would suffice till India has seven billion connections. This could mean liberal allocation to service providers and administrative ease.Besides, the telecom regulator states that data-only SIM which used in dongles and some more products are directly shifted to 13-digit numbers instead of 10 digits. For the unaware; the Department of Telecommunication has already recommended 13-digits for M2M connections. Meanwhile, the regulator said the numbers that have been already surrendered by telecom operators might be given others. Sparingly used sub-levels in levels (starting with) 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 may be withdrawn after seeking sub-level-wise utilization from the operators providing fixed-line services and can be used for future allocations, it said. After exhausting all the surrendered numbering resources, the existing SDCA codes starting with 6, 3, 4, and 2 may be used for mobile services by suffixing with 0, 1, 8, and 9, Trai added.TRAI Will Take Call On Floor Pricing After The Lockdown EndsApart from that, TRAI said that it rejected the operators request to set up the floor pricing as soon as possible. All three leading operators have asked the regulator to fix the floor pricing for prepaid plans. In fact, Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone-Idea believe that this can save the industry as the government is not providing any relief to them.On the other hand, TRAI said that setting up floor prices are not good for consumers as it will affect their pockets, and they have shell out more money from their pocket.

 And just because you can’t be together, that doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy a sweet treat together. After all, what’s a birthday party without a cake? Jenny Lisher had birthday cupcakes from Whole Foods delivered to all of the children attending Isabella’s virtual tea party. Each child was also sent a package of sprinkles so the kids could decorate their treats as a group and then cheer as the birthday girl blew out her candles.

As many as 1,273 migrant labourers stranded in different parts of Ballari district thanks to prolonged COVID-19 lockdown left for their native places in West Bengal by a special Shramik Express train from Ballari on Saturday.
 The top brass of the district administration including Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul, Superintendent of Police C.K. Baba, Additional Deputy Commissioner Manjunath, and Additional Superintendent of Police B.N. Lavanya were present in Ballari railway station to offer warm sendoff to the departing labourers.
 Before they were taken to the railway station to board the train, the labourers were subjected to a thorough medical examination at Ballari Central Bus Station and Government Model Higher Primary School in Toranagal. The fitness certificate and train tickets were given to the passengers after sensitising them on the precautions to be taken during the journey in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. They were also provided with food packets and water bottles enough for them to reach their destinations.

 Now, COVID-19 is forcing parents to become tech-savvy in a short span of time to help their children learn. This may become the new normal with far-reaching implications for students from lower economic groups. Its effects need to be studied further so that the experience becomes valuable in overhauling the Indian higher education system. Unlike the West, we have never developed a backup online education dissemination plan.
 According to the 2018-19 All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), there are 993 universities, 39,931 colleges and 10,725 independent institutions nationwide. Unfortunately, higher education institutions are concentrated mostly in urban areas, and that is the reason for the poor Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER). However, the GER has increased during the last five years, from 24.3 in 2014-15 to 26.3 in 2018-19. An effective online education system can mitigate this challenge, bring more objectivity and transparency and GER can reach beyond 80%.
 There are challenges as well. Many students today travel abroad to get a good education, primarily due to the lack of globally ranked education institutions in India. Harvard University has around 21.1% international students in its entire student body in both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. At Oxford, this number is 43%, with students from more than 150 countries. Almost 30% of the student body of the National University of Singapore, included among the league of premier Asian universities, comprises international students. In contrast, the rate of enrolment of international students in Indian institutions is considerably less. At the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, the number is only one per cent; Jamia Hamdard — recently recommended as an ‘Institution of Eminence’ (IoE) by the Ministry of Human Resources Development — has about 7%.
 According to the 2018-19 All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), a total of 47,427 international students are enrolled in different Indian universities. The majority belong to India’s neighbouring countries. COVID-19 will definitely limit their international travel and the proportion of foreign students enrolled in Indian Universities will also reduce.
 The above description is an argument towards the Indian education system waiting for a revamp. If India is to be featured on a larger scale on the global education platforms, this is the time. Significant focus needs to be laid on technology and innovation with improvisations in the IT infrastructure.
 Such a crisis can be turned into an opportunity to align with upcoming prospects. This is the perfect occasion to understand possible threats, spot loopholes and work on capacity building. The Finance Minister has announced that the top 100 universities in the country will be permitted to start online courses by May 30, 2020, which is a welcome step. This will help in increasing the GER substantially with increased enrolment from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. We have never given online or distance mode of education as much weightage as the regular mode. This is the right time to change this mindset.
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) and other regulatory bodies need to revise their protocols so that online education is made more mainstream. Faculty selection criteria should also be amended to check for technology friendliness. The current disruption in the education sector will lead to a paradigm shift in the learning process. This will bring more transparency and address to deliver quality education on a large scale while ensuring inclusive e-learning. Paul Reville, the Francis Keppel Professor of Practice of Educational Policy and Administration at Harvard Graduate School of Education, says, “We don’t simply want to frantically struggle to restore the status quo because the status quo wasn’t operating at an effective level and certainly wasn’t serving all of our children fairly”. The already existing financial and technological disparities among various students have been made more apparent by the current scenario.
 The online education system cannot function unless there is a reliable backup of Information Technology infrastructure. Very few universities have a good quality IT-enabled education system, which also has Internet connectivity with good bandwidth and a robust security system, in place. Till now, we never realised the need for an online university with universal, curriculum-linked resources for teaching and learning integrated curriculum widely delivered with a blended model. There are opportunities for universities to leverage the Internet and offer an “anytime, anywhere, anyone” model of higher education. The real challenge will be professional courses like Medicine, Nursing and Engineering. The education system should also focus on creating innovative career opportunities as we could see a complete change in the future job markets.
 With the young population in India being a large number, policy makers should look at developing a consortium-type cluster university platform. A group of premier institutions like IoEs can form a virtual cluster education model to offer low-cost, high-quality, professional education that does not need separate campuses or geographic boundaries. For cost-effectiveness and economies of scale, cluster universities can share administrative resources to reduce duplication of activities. Such IT-enabled universities will have to deal with a large student base and, therefore, cannot falter on infrastructure. This requires enormous investment and the majority of the Indian institutions cannot afford that unless the government provides support. The national education budget should absorb the cost of these technologies for at least all the IoEs regardless of their status as private or public.
 India spends considerably less on education compared to many other countries. The operational expenditures of Harvard University and Oxford University are $5.2 billion and $3.1 billion per annum, respectively. On the contrary, as per the annual budget of 2019-2020, the total allocation for the higher education sector in India is less than $ 5.0 billion. This implies that the entire nation’s higher education budget is less than Harvard University’s annual operational expenditure alone!
 The IoE tag permits certain institutions to admit up to 30% international students with no restrictions levied on the fee charged from them. They can also hire foreign faculty up to 25% of the total number. With the focus on online or distance learning, hiring foreign faculty will be easy and cost- effective. In the recent past, India has become one of the fastest-growing sources of outbound students. The latest trends have demonstrated an increase in the number of students pursuing undergraduate education abroad, in contrast to earlier scene when students migrated for a post-graduate degree or a doctorate. Many students now seek admissions in foreign institutions immediately after high school, which is evidence of the availability of buying power, demand and a favourable market.
 According to the data recorded by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, nearly 753,000 Indian students were enrolled in foreign universities as of July 2018. Another study conducted by ASSOCHAM and Tata Institute of Social Sciences, reveals that the expenditure of Indian students on foreign education amounts to $7 billion or around ₹45,000 crore a year. This outbound travel can be reduced significantly if global levels of quality can be obtained from Indian universities. Also, IoEs like Jamia Hamdard, IITs and IIMs can enhance their capacity through online mode. While this will trigger a competition to attract Indian students, the country will benefit enormously in the long run and emerge as a world leader in quality education with global rankings coming as a bonus!

The current pandemic has adversely affected every aspect of human life from health, business, and leisure to education. Schools and colleges are closed and there are many doubts about the short-term and long-term impact of the measures being used to tackle the problem. Even after the pandemic subsides, its ripple effects will have a permanent impact on education.
 While most educational institutions have shifted to online teaching, this approach will be challenging in the long term. Amid what is likely to be a deep economic recession, students and parents have begun to question what type of higher education provides the best value (if any). COVID-19 will also exacerbate some of the pre-existing and systemic challenges faced by higher education providers.
 Since independence, the higher education system in India has undergone a development spurt, entailing drastic improvements in the number of establishments, enrolment rate, faculty positions, infrastructure development and provision of facilities and technological advancements. India boasts the second-most expanded higher education system globally. The regulatory roadmap of this sector is curated by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which devises appropriate guidelines and standards, keeps a check on the extent to which they are implemented countrywide, and aligns the functions of the central and the state governments. However, unlike the West, we have never developed a backup online education plan.

Party State president Subhash Barala said historical achievements had been made during the first year of the Narendra Modi government and the party would leave no stone unturned to spread them among the masses. “The wishes and aspirations of the common people have been fulfilled after many decades, which included legislation to end triple talaq, Section 370 of the Constitution, granting Ladakh Union Territory status, paving the way for the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya etc. They will be written in golden letters in the pages of history,” said Mr. Barala.
 “In view of these achievements, the party has prepared a roadmap for organising various programmes. State general secretary Sandeep Joshi will look after the coordination of these programmes where social distancing and other protocols related to COVID-19 will be followed,” he said.
 Videos on the efforts made by the government in fighting coronavirus (COVID-19) will also be released.
 “During the contact campaign, 10 lakh face masks and a similar number of sanitisers will also be distributed in the State,” said Mr. Barala.

The current pandemic has adversely affected every aspect of human life from health, business, and leisure to education. Schools and colleges are closed and there are many doubts about the short-term and long-term impact of the measures being used to tackle the problem. Even after the pandemic subsides, its ripple effects will have a permanent impact on education.
 While most educational institutions have shifted to online teaching, this approach will be challenging in the long term. Amid what is likely to be a deep economic recession, students and parents have begun to question what type of higher education provides the best value (if any). COVID-19 will also exacerbate some of the pre-existing and systemic challenges faced by higher education providers.
 Since independence, the higher education system in India has undergone a development spurt, entailing drastic improvements in the number of establishments, enrolment rate, faculty positions, infrastructure development and provision of facilities and technological advancements. India boasts the second-most expanded higher education system globally. The regulatory roadmap of this sector is curated by the University Grants Commission (UGC), which devises appropriate guidelines and standards, keeps a check on the extent to which they are implemented countrywide, and aligns the functions of the central and the state governments. However, unlike the West, we have never developed a backup online education plan.
 Now, COVID-19 is forcing parents to become tech-savvy in a short span of time to help their children learn. This may become the new normal with far-reaching implications for students from lower economic groups. Its effects need to be studied further so that the experience becomes valuable in overhauling the Indian higher education system. Unlike the West, we have never developed a backup online education dissemination plan.
 According to the 2018-19 All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), there are 993 universities, 39,931 colleges and 10,725 independent institutions nationwide. Unfortunately, higher education institutions are concentrated mostly in urban areas, and that is the reason for the poor Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER). However, the GER has increased during the last five years, from 24.3 in 2014-15 to 26.3 in 2018-19. An effective online education system can mitigate this challenge, bring more objectivity and transparency and GER can reach beyond 80%.
 There are challenges as well. Many students today travel abroad to get a good education, primarily due to the lack of globally ranked education institutions in India. Harvard University has around 21.1% international students in its entire student body in both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. At Oxford, this number is 43%, with students from more than 150 countries. Almost 30% of the student body of the National University of Singapore, included among the league of premier Asian universities, comprises international students. In contrast, the rate of enrolment of international students in Indian institutions is considerably less. At the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, the number is only one per cent; Jamia Hamdard — recently recommended as an ‘Institution of Eminence’ (IoE) by the Ministry of Human Resources Development — has about 7%.
 According to the 2018-19 All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE), a total of 47,427 international students are enrolled in different Indian universities. The majority belong to India’s neighbouring countries. COVID-19 will definitely limit their international travel and the proportion of foreign students enrolled in Indian Universities will also reduce.
 The above description is an argument towards the Indian education system waiting for a revamp. If India is to be featured on a larger scale on the global education platforms, this is the time. Significant focus needs to be laid on technology and innovation with improvisations in the IT infrastructure.
 Such a crisis can be turned into an opportunity to align with upcoming prospects. This is the perfect occasion to understand possible threats, spot loopholes and work on capacity building. The Finance Minister has announced that the top 100 universities in the country will be permitted to start online courses by May 30, 2020, which is a welcome step. This will help in increasing the GER substantially with increased enrolment from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. We have never given online or distance mode of education as much weightage as the regular mode. This is the right time to change this mindset.
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) and other regulatory bodies need to revise their protocols so that online education is made more mainstream. Faculty selection criteria should also be amended to check for technology friendliness. The current disruption in the education sector will lead to a paradigm shift in the learning process. This will bring more transparency and address to deliver quality education on a large scale while ensuring inclusive e-learning. Paul Reville, the Francis Keppel Professor of Practice of Educational Policy and Administration at Harvard Graduate School of Education, says, “We don’t simply want to frantically struggle to restore the status quo because the status quo wasn’t operating at an effective level and certainly wasn’t serving all of our children fairly”. The already existing financial and technological disparities among various students have been made more apparent by the current scenario.
 The online education system cannot function unless there is a reliable backup of Information Technology infrastructure. Very few universities have a good quality IT-enabled education system, which also has Internet connectivity with good bandwidth and a robust security system, in place. Till now, we never realised the need for an online university with universal, curriculum-linked resources for teaching and learning integrated curriculum widely delivered with a blended model. There are opportunities for universities to leverage the Internet and offer an “anytime, anywhere, anyone” model of higher education. The real challenge will be professional courses like Medicine, Nursing and Engineering. The education system should also focus on creating innovative career opportunities as we could see a complete change in the future job markets.
 With the young population in India being a large number, policy makers should look at developing a consortium-type cluster university platform. A group of premier institutions like IoEs can form a virtual cluster education model to offer low-cost, high-quality, professional education that does not need separate campuses or geographic boundaries. For cost-effectiveness and economies of scale, cluster universities can share administrative resources to reduce duplication of activities. Such IT-enabled universities will have to deal with a large student base and, therefore, cannot falter on infrastructure. This requires enormous investment and the majority of the Indian institutions cannot afford that unless the government provides support. The national education budget should absorb the cost of these technologies for at least all the IoEs regardless of their status as private or public.
 India spends considerably less on education compared to many other countries. The operational expenditures of Harvard University and Oxford University are $5.2 billion and $3.1 billion per annum, respectively. On the contrary, as per the annual budget of 2019-2020, the total allocation for the higher education sector in India is less than $ 5.0 billion. This implies that the entire nation’s higher education budget is less than Harvard University’s annual operational expenditure alone!
 The IoE tag permits certain institutions to admit up to 30% international students with no restrictions levied on the fee charged from them. They can also hire foreign faculty up to 25% of the total number. With the focus on online or distance learning, hiring foreign faculty will be easy and cost- effective. In the recent past, India has become one of the fastest-growing sources of outbound students. The latest trends have demonstrated an increase in the number of students pursuing undergraduate education abroad, in contrast to earlier scene when students migrated for a post-graduate degree or a doctorate. Many students now seek admissions in foreign institutions immediately after high school, which is evidence of the availability of buying power, demand and a favourable market.
 According to the data recorded by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, nearly 753,000 Indian students were enrolled in foreign universities as of July 2018. Another study conducted by ASSOCHAM and Tata Institute of Social Sciences, reveals that the expenditure of Indian students on foreign education amounts to $7 billion or around ₹45,000 crore a year. This outbound travel can be reduced significantly if global levels of quality can be obtained from Indian universities. Also, IoEs like Jamia Hamdard, IITs and IIMs can enhance their capacity through online mode. While this will trigger a competition to attract Indian students, the country will benefit enormously in the long run and emerge as a world leader in quality education with global rankings coming as a bonus!

CHICAGO (AP) — Many Chicago-area high school students have needed to pick up jobs amid the pandemic as essential workers, even as they try to complete their studies through remote learning. Whether they are working to help out their parents who lost their jobs or means of income, or are just trying to save money, they are still students at the end of the day, still expected to participate in their online classes, according to the Chicago Tribune. “My dad used to work 45 hours and now he can barely get 30 hours,” one Chicago Public Schools students wrote in an online petition seeking relief from the district’s grading policy for remote learning. “He doesn’t make enough for bills and food so I started to work two jobs of a combined 50 hours so I can help with the bills. I can’t even do homework.” Another teen, 18-year-old Sadie Soto, works 30 to 35 hours at a Jewel-Osco in Avondale. She says the last thing she wants to do after a long day at work is e-learning. “When I get home, I am utterly exhausted. I thought working at a grocery store would be easier, but it's really, really physically demanding in a way I didn't expect,\" she said. In addition to work and classes, Avery Martin keeps busy running miles to maintain her cross-country stamina. Martin works at Cafe Zupas, a suburban sandwich. Since business has been slow, it allows her to do her schoolwork during downtime. She says, however, that learning without the structure of school has been more difficult.
