LONDON (AP) — America’s top infectious disease expert has apologized for suggesting U.K. authorities rushed their authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine, saying he has “great faith” in the country’s regulators.Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sparked controversy with an earlier interview in which he said U.K. regulators hadn’t acted “as carefully” as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Fauci said late Thursday that he meant to say U.S. authorities do things differently than their British counterparts, not better, but his comments weren’t phrased properly.“I do have great faith in both the scientific community and the regulatory community at the U.K., and anyone who knows me and my relationship with that over literally decades, you know that’s the case,” Fauci told the BBC.Britain on Wednesday became the first Western nation to authorize widespread use of a COVID-19 vaccine when regulators gave emergency approval to a product made by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany- based BioNTech. Critics have suggested that U.K. regulators emphasized speed over thoroughness when they reviewed data on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.Fauci rejected that idea.The FDA has to move more slowly because of the high degree of skepticism about vaccines in the U.S., Fauci said. Because of this, U.S. regulators are reviewing all of the raw data from Pfizer and BioNTech “in a way that could not possibly have been done any more quickly,” he said.It will take the FDA at least another week to complete its review, but the U.S. and Britain will ultimately end up in the same place, Fauci said.“At the end of the day, it’s going to be safe, it’s going to be effective,” he said. “The people in the U.K. are going to receive it, and they’re going to do really well, and the people in the United States are going to receive it, and we’re going to do pretty well.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Commercial roll out of the ambitious 5G technology in India has been in a hang for years now with the delay seemingly stretching over and beyond 2020 as well. While the industry has been in conflict with the government over what it contends as high pricing and scanty availability of the spectrum in the 3.3-3.6 GHz bands, the financial knockout on account of AGR has effectively made the operators incapable of bidding within this fiscal.
 Even though Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Jio and BSNL submitted applications to conduct field trials with DoT on January 15, industry experts still see 5G coming to India by 2022 since telcos having their balance sheets badly bruised lack monetary headroom to bid for the final auctions.
 In contrast, just two days before the new year, on December 30, the government allowed Chinese player Huawei (read all vendors) to conduct field trials in partnership with the telecom players. The move came after India’s prolonged silence over Huawei’s participation in 5G deployments in light of the United States pressing India to bar Huawei from deploying the network. India, however, finally took a position on the issue as it juggles to maintain strategic balance with two of its major trade partners--China and the US.

 In their Week 4 win over the Packers at Lambeau, they used 12/13-personnel on 29 of 60 plays. It benefited both their run and pass games. The Eagles rushed for 176 yards on 33 carries against the Packers in the win. Miles Sanders and Jordan Howard combined for 159 of those yards. Ninety-nine of them came in 12/13-personnel.

LIVERPOOL (TNS) — Village Burger in Liverpool is becoming the latest victim of the coronavirus pandemic. The popular burger joint will close permanently on Saturday.
 Owner Art Silva said the pandemic has cut sales in half, prompting him to call it quits after nearly 10 years in business. With him and his wife Kathye at retirement age, they plan to move south to be closer to their children, a grandchild and, soon, a second grandchild.
 “Business has been tough, obviously,” Silva said. “And my landlord’s not working with me to do anything, and I’m building up a big owe to him. Thirdly, I reached 65 and my son down in South Carolina has a 15-month-old, and they’ve got another one on the way. My other son is in North Carolina, and my daughter’s going to be moving down to South Carolina, so I don’t have any family left up here to continue the business.”
 Silva opened the business in a former McDonald’s at 920 Old Liverpool Road in February 2011, featuring half-pound burgers available in 17 varieties, plus a special burger of the week. Among its offerings is the Heart Stopper, a deep- fried burger stuffed with mozzarella cheese and topped with bacon and onion rings.
 Syracuse.com crowned Village Burger the champion of its first-ever Best of CNY Burger Battle in 2012. It's also known for its haddock dinners and clam chowder.
 But Silva said the pandemic has devastated the business. Fear of the virus has made customers reluctant to dine in. He opened the former McDonald’s drive- thru window hoping that would boost sales. But the business is not set up for quick-serve because it cooks everything to order, so customers must order ahead and then come to the drive-thru at a specified time.
 “We can’t do drive up and order,” he said. “We don’t have them pre-cooked. We cook from scratch. And it takes a lot of time, with all the sauces we have and all the different recipes that we put together and even the way we cook fresh fries and make the patties. It’s just more work with less results coming out.”
 Silva closed his dine-in service earlier this week. Only his pick-up service at the drive-thru window will be open for the rest of the week.

Norwegian prog quintet Leprous have released a video for their brand new single Castaway Angels, which i released today through InsideOut Music. The new song was recently tracked at Ocean Sound Recordings in Norway and mixed by Adam Noble (Placebo, Biffy Clyro, Nothing But Thieves).


  "This year we've all had to readjust our lives, do new things," says singer Einar Solberg. "Missed out on things we were supposed to do, and find new things to do. One day in the beginning of the corona outbreak in Norway I came to TorO's house with a song we were supposed to work on together. The problem was that I was already finished with the sketch we were supposed to be working on (which was later on thrown away as it wasn't that good after all), so we just sat down to try to make something new. Him with the acoustic guitar, and me with my voice.


  "During a quite short time, we came up with the main structure of what was later to become _Castaway Angels_. Very basic, very pure and no technology to distract us. Just the melody and the guitar. So once we got in the amazing Ocean Sound Recording near Aalesund, Norway we continued that approach with the full band. We recorded the song together in the studio (when we were not busy sitting in the Jacuzzi being in awe by the view) in one take, after jamming together for one evening. It's so typical to get obsessed with details, perfectionism and layers. But here we just wanted to play together. Do something pure and simple. I'm very pleased with the result, and can't wait for everyone to hear how we've been spending time together when we were supposed to be on tour."


  Leprous singer Einar Solberg will perform a completely stripped down piano and vocal livestream concert for the first time ever, where he will play music from a big part of the Leprous discography. The concert will take place this Sunday, December 6th, 2020 in the beautiful Telemark Gallery in Notodden, the town where Solberg grew up and where Leprous started.

SC in a closed hearing on January 16 dismissed Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Teleservices' plea that they had filed back in November asking the court for a review of its October AGR ruling. Airtel and VIL have said they are likely to file curative petitions with January 23 due date impending in sight. The rejection to extend any help to carriers could potentially lead to a two player industry, analysts believe. VIL being left in the lurch could be seeing exiting the industry as KM Birla has previously said.
 Tariff revisions are believed to take the sector towards recovery, however, more clarity on where exactly the industry will be headed to will come post January 23 deadline of paying AGR compensation.
 Additionally, ahead of the Union budget coming on February 1, the industry which is being weighed down by multiple taxes and levies has reportedly asked the government for aid in the form of reduction of regulatory levies, taxes and license fees with lower interest rates to access credit. Demands for removal of GST from license fee and spectrum usage charges have also been made.

Other vaccines gained traction more slowly. Though vaccinations against measles, whooping cough, diphtheria and rubella were first offered much earlier, it took until the 1990s for vaccination rates to eclipse 90%.


  More recently, the internet has accelerated a global movement against vaccines — the so-called anti-vaxxers. Their numbers are relatively small, and the United States still has high rates of immunization. But because vaccine skeptics tend to be savvy about marshaling social media, they’ve wielded outsize influence in debates over vaccines, leading to a resurgence of measles and other preventable diseases in some communities. Now they could cause trouble in the rollout of coronavirus vaccines, too.


  “The anti-vaxxers were very involved in the reopen movement, and in the anti- mask movement, and in the reject-all-scientific-evidence” movement, said Renée DiResta, the technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory and a longtime scholar of how these groups use the internet. While DiResta expects that Americans are sick of isolation and will be eager to get vaccinated, she fears that in some geographic or social circles, anti-vaccine activists will wreak havoc.


  “In certain communities, the low rates could mean that the vaccine is not as effective as it could be, and so diseases continue to take hold,” she said.


  There are other worries. Noel Brewer, a professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the University of North Carolina who studies why people choose to get vaccinated, told me that he hates the name of the program that accelerated work on the vaccines. “Warp speed” was a good way to emphasize its speedy development — but emphasizing speed could also sow doubt about the vaccine’s quality. In September, a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans worried that President Donald Trump was rushing the vaccines for political reasons.


  Brewer also fears a slide into partisan warfare. “We don’t have much history with vaccination being a right or left issue — vaccination is pretty well embraced across the political spectrum,” he said. But on the right, there is a strong resistance to government mandates, which might play into increased skepticism about getting vaccinated.


  South Korea’s public health officials have been praised for the transparent way they investigated and shut down misinformation about the flu vaccine, but rates of vaccination remain low — only 19 million people have gotten the flu shot, far short of the goal of 30 million. Still, Bruce Gellin, the president of global immunization at the Sabin Vaccine Institute, told me that Americans should allow scientists, rather than politicians, to take the lead in communicating about vaccines, as the Koreans did.


  “If you do the math, you can anticipate that strokes and heart attacks will occur within days and weeks of being vaccinated, and since these are common occurrences, every media market will have a story about this — the person was fine, and then following vaccination they had a stroke,” Gellin told me. “That speaks to the need to keep our eyes open for things like this — to anticipate them and to look into them.”


  Preparing for these incidents requires setting up monitoring systems early and quickly and transparently investigating problems in a way that solidifies public trust — in other words, exactly the sort of competence that has been missing from the Trump administration’s coronavirus plans.


  I expect the Biden administration to be more rigorous and transparent. And Brewer told me that making the vaccines free and easy for Americans to get will be a much more effective way of promoting their use than devising some clever public relations campaign.


  Still, I’m gloomy. We’ve had a hard time getting Americans on the same page about anything related to this virus. Now, we might have a magic bullet — or we may not, depending on whomever you choose to believe.

Reilly, barn and orchard, was on the 1600 foot ridgeback facing southwesterly.  Behind the site the ridge fell off into timber, then down to the south branch of the Navarro North Fork. Curiously there was no evidence of the original Reilly house, just a modern mobile home, a summer residence for veteran Pan American Airways pilot, Bob Zentner.  But the barn a hundred yards away was, despite resting, unlike most others in The Valley, gently on the southwesterly sidehill facing Greenwood Ridge,  was in very healthy repair, no fences or corrals though.  The orchard, dry-farmed historically and still cultivated and harvested by Cecil Gowan, was a work of beauty.  The trees, laid out in perfect lines every twenty feet, few missing, were naturally dwarfed, about fifteen feet tall, due to the shallowness of the ridgetop soil. I suppose there were maybe altogether fifteen or twenty different varieties available to us, from early ripening Grabenstein to Baldwins, Jonathan, Macs, etc.,  harvested later on in the season.  And there were  for trespassers and hunter gatherers, we and the deer plenty of grounders under the trees too.  We always drove up there with a couple of paper shopping bags, along with the rifle, dog and Tokay Pop bottle, on board our transportation.

  TULSA, Oklahoma Dec 2 (Reuters) - American Airlines' maintenance team is scrambling to complete safety changes to its fleet of Boeing 737 MAX jets ahead of a phased return to service, while deliveries of new jets are set to begin as early as this week.


  American's maintenance base, the largest in the world, has housed its 24 MAX planes during a 20-month safety ban that followed the second of two fatal crashes for the aircraft in March 2019, forcing some 400 MAX jets in service to be grounded.


  It has handled some unexpected tasks while caring for the idled jets, including evicting wildlife and custom-making tarps.


  "Birds like to nest in things. Combating that has been rather interesting," said Erik Olund, managing director of base maintenance in Tulsa, Oklahoma, under the wing of a 737 MAX.


  Following a Nov. 18 order from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) detailing necessary changes for the jet to fly again, 260 American Airlines' specialists divided into three shifts are working round the clock, seven days a week to roll out two jets every seven to 10 days.


  But as the aircraft returns during a pandemic that has crushed air travel demand and left questions over customers' willingness to fly, American is planning a phased re-introduction to its commercial schedule.


  "We don't want to bring them out so fast that we're not flying them (...) and have to put them back into storage," said American's chief operating officer David Seymour at the hangar, where the company hosted media on Wednesday.


  American is launching commercial service on Dec. 29 with a daily flight between Miami and New York City and will gradually reintroduce the jets as its 2,600 737 pilots cycle through a 2-1/2 hour-simulator training.


  It plans to take delivery of eight new 737 MAX jets from Boeing this month that would already have the FAA-mandated system upgrades, Seymour said. The first delivery could happen this week, and some of those new jets may fly before the maintenance crew works through all 24 in Tulsa.


  Boeing has a backlog of 450 jets parked at its own facilities that it built during the grounding, when MAX deliveries were frozen.


  "There's a lot at stake here and nobody is going to rush this airplane before it's operationally ready or safe," Olund said.


  Each plane will take an operational readiness flight and receive FAA sign-off before flying passengers.


  One of the early problems American's team encountered when the jets were grounded was finding enough tarps to cover the engines. So the team made the covers themselves in the floorboard shop, using foam and corrugated plastic sheets.


  Then, every 10 days mechanics would remove all of the covers, run the engines, cycle the flaps and rotate the tires. They also moved wiring bundles after a regulatory mandate in March and conducted a full sweep of the fuel tanks to ensure no foreign objects.


  All said, they spent 64,000 hours keeping the jets in shape during the longest grounding in commercial aviation history. (Reporting by Tracy Rucinski; Editing by Tim Hepher and Mark Potter)

“It’s probably not feasible with the amount of tests that are available,” Puett said. “We take the COVID screening and the testing process very seriously. If we presume someone needs testing, then we absolutely will take them and have them tested.”


  But this creates problems if someone is asymptomatic.


  “That’s how we feel that some (cases) got in on us, was that we had an asymptomatic person come in, and was in an area around some other inmates,” Puett said.


  The population in the Buchanan County jail fluctuates but has been on the higher end more recently. At the time of this article, the population was 184 inmates.


  “We would like the population to be down,” Puett said. “But that involves other entities. That involves the prosecutor’s office. That involves the courts.”


  “I have to stress that this is a double-edged sword,” Puett said. “What I mean by that is that people don’t get a free pass on committing crimes. They commit crimes, they victimize someone and they’re going to come to jail. We can’t just let people out because of COVID.”


  Simon recommends a couple solutions.


  “A possible solution to the overcrowding nature to where they could keep and maintain a successful quarantine, would be to release on their own recognizance, not give up the charge, but release on their own recognizance with new court dates, everybody that’s applicable,” Simon said.


  According to 5th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Keith Marquart, this looks simple on paper but involves a lot more factors.


  “There’s a pandemic going on,” Marquart said. “The pandemic may be in the jail, why should we submit people to that kind of exposure if they don’t have to be exposed? But then the other side of the issue is, what did they commit? Have they failed to appear before? Have they failed to appear in this case before? Do they have convictions for resisting arrest? Is it a violent crime? Is it a non violent crime? There are many things that need to be considered, other than the fact that there’s a pandemic going on.”


  Another solution to the overcrowding problem is by creating more room. Before the pandemic, the jail began creating 10 new cells, which will be finished in about a month.


  “We do everything humanly possible within our availability,” Puett said. “Like I said, the sanitation, the hand washing, the masks and all those things right now are the best tools that we have turned to to fight and keep COVID out of jail.”

The most pressing and awaited decision on Turkey for Biden will be how to respond to Turkey’s purchase of the Russian-made S-400 missile defense system.

Last month, Turkey took one of the final steps towards making the system operational by holding a live-fire test, which the United States swiftly condemned.

India started off slowly and were going at 7 at the end of the Powerplay. Rahul was looking good and scored a fine fifty while Dhawan and Kohli did not have a great game. Samson looked really good out in the middle but then against the run of play he fell and that triggered a collapse. Pandey, Rahul and then Pandya fell in quick succession and that put a lot of pressure on India's lower order. Jadeja then came to the party once again as his blitz of 44 from 23 balls helps India to a total which can be challenging.

Many of the slaughterhouses I dealt with also processed deer during the hunting seasons, and this gave me a firsthand view of the quality of field care deer carcasses had received, especially in regards to field-dressing (aka “gutting”) and cleanliness, and bringing matters in a timely manner before spoilage. The majority of the examples arrived in proper form, but there were enough examples that were in such a deplorable condition, to say the least, that the successful hunter obviously had no clue of how to properly handle matters. The result is often a “gamey” flavor, and in my opinion, there is no such thing with properly handled procedures, from the field to processing the meat, and on to the table.

The first thing in order for a dead deer before all else is to tag it properly. I use plastic zip-ties because they are quick, easy, and stay secure. I then roll the deer on its back, and whenever possible, with the front positioned uphill to allow any blood drainage to go downhill, away from the project. I also believe the shoulder-length plastic gloves are a true blessing in keeping hands/arms and clothing clean. In the “old days,” I rolled up my sleeves and went to work. Then came the buck that had bedded in poison ivy, and I paid my dues, and I’ve been donning plastic gloves ever since.
