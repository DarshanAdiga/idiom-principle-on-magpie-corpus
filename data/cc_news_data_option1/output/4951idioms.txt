There was no relief in sight for commuters from long traffic snarls as thousands of farmers continued to camp out on the borders of Delhi, blocking key entrances to Delhi for the seventh day on the trot.
 While the police have kept the Haryana-Delhi border at Singhu and Tikri closed for traffic, the protest at Ghazipur, the city‚Äôs border with U.P., led to the closure of a key route connecting Delhi with the State for the second consecutive day.
 ‚ÄúThe Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic due to farmers‚Äô protests near Gautam Budh Dwar. People are advised to avoid Noida link road for going to Noida and use NH-24 and DND instead,‚Äù the traffic police tweeted.
 Two more border points connecting Delhi with Gurugram and Jhajjar-Bahadurgarh were also closed as precautionary measures.
 The traffic police said the borders at Tikri, Jharoda and Jhatikra were closed for traffic movement. The Badusarai border was open only for two-wheelers. Available open borders to Haryana are Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera, they said.
 As traffic spilled over to alternate routes, it led to long jams there as well.
 The police also closed Kalindi Kunj border after receiving inputs that farmers might gather there.
 ‚ÄúBarricades were put up and security was enhanced as a precautionary measure,‚Äù a senior police official said.
 ‚ÄúTraffic movement closed at Kalindi Kunj Border [both carriageway]. Kindly avoid the stretch,‚Äù Delhi Traffic Police tweeted from its official handle.
 However, after farmers did not arrive at the Kalindi Kunj border, it was opened for traffic.
 The protest against the new farm laws is set to continue as the critical talks between three Union Ministers and farmer groups ended in a stalemate on Tuesday after they rejected the government‚Äôs suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by agitating farmers.
 The two sides, however, decided to meet again on Thursday.

Sinn F√©in spokesperson on Higher Education, Rose Conway-Walsh TD, has raised the issue of school cleaners being denied pension rights, with the Minister for Education in the D√°il.
 Teachta Conway-Walsh said:
 "If you are a cleaner in a school, you are an essential worker employed by a government funded institution ‚Äì yet you do not have the entitlement rights of others in the same workplace.
 "Is that unfair? Yes. The Department must change the system to eradicate this inequality.
 ‚ÄúI asked the Minister for Education for her views on whether cleaners are critical staff in the running of schools and whether she plans to provide pension rights to long-term service cleaners.
 ‚ÄúI did not get her views as a response, I got the same old chapter and verse of what the rules are now ‚Äì cleaners don‚Äôt work for the Department of Education, they work for the school. This is an abdication of responsibility.
 ‚ÄúWe have heard this bogus argument before regarding school secretaries and caretakers. Recently, the government finally agreed to sit down for talks to regularise their pay, conditions of employment and pension provision.
 ‚ÄúThe absolutely vital role that cleaners have always played in schools is even more crucial during Covid-19. Yet they, like many others, are undervalued workers in our public services. They are critical components of our education system and deserve to have that rightly reflected in their work and pay conditions."

 He also said that Captain Singh had many chances to stop these farm bills as he was a member of committee to formulate and examine these bills, but did not stop these by raising objections in the committee itself.
 ‚ÄúWhy did you not intimate people about how the Centre is trying to bring in these black laws? The farmers of Punjab want to know why you did not stop these farm bills,‚Äù Mr. Kejriwal asked.
 In his press statement, Mr. Kejriwal requested everybody to support the farmers. ‚ÄúWhen some call the farmers ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô, ‚Äòanti-nationals‚Äô for protesting, I cannot imagine what the soldiers on the border must be going through, whose parents are being called terrorists.

The move marks the latest way Microsoft's been expanding its gaming chops. Its Xbox division, which has been offering game consoles and high profile titles like the Halo space war franchise since 2001, is one of the biggest players in the more than $120 billion industry. Microsoft's also spent big to buy key video game makers, including $2.5 billion for the world-building game Minecraft in 2014, $7.5 billion for Fallout, Doom and The Elder Scrolls maker ZeniMax Media this year, and acquisitions of smaller game makers in the past few years as well.
 Not all of Microsoft's gaming acquisitions have gone smoothly though. Microsoft bought the game streaming service Beam in 2016 to compete with Amazon's popular Twitch.tv, both of which are designed for people to watch entertainers, professionals and fans play games live over the internet. Microsoft rebranded the service as Mixer, and built its capabilities into the Xbox video game console. Ultimately, Mixer wasn't able to catch up and Microsoft shut the service down earlier this year.

You are Randolph Carter, member of an elite undercover infiltration team known as ODIN, a morally dubious unit that specializes in meta-shamanism. By fusing futuristic hacking technology with consciousness-altering drugs to stealthily insert themselves into Cyber Enclaves - more pleasant digital realms used as an escape from the harsh misery of their crumbling world - its agents are able to attain information and sell it to the highest bidder. Now someone, or something, is hunting down the members of ODIN one by one, and Carter must get to the bottom of his inexplicable dreams of alien races on distant planets to keep from being the next victim.

The movie is " Black Bear," a meta thriller about moviemaking, creativity and ego from writer-director Lawrence Michael Levine that debuted earlier this year at Sundance and is the kind of indie that can so easily get lost just because it is never going to be an Oscar contender. It also has the misfortune of being enormously tricky to describe coherently or satisfyingly: It essentially becomes a different movie halfway through. But even though it is purposefully disorienting and occasionally a little too heightened, it is never not interesting and keeps you rapt with its captivating performances, revealing dialogue and moody, lo-fi style.

Instead, the game pursues its objective of getting to the bottom of Carter's dreams with such single-minded determination that it ends up running roughshod over any attempts to create immersion in this highly intriguing world. And when the climax does finally pop up (unexpectedly and completely out of the blue, no less), it doesn't offer anything more than a weak, highly unsatisfying cliffhanger ending that took me completely aback and really undermined my enjoyment of what led up to it.

It may be even worse. An academic team examined the potential effects of interrupting classroom learning and reported last week that it will mean a greater loss of life in the long run.
 The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, estimates that 24.2 million children aged 5 to 11 each lost a median of 54 days in school last spring. That, the researchers said, translates into 5.53 million fewer years of life due to lower educational achievement, nearly four times the estimated 1.47 million years of life that would be lost had schools remained open.

Il contagio virale, che ci ha colti di sorpresa e del tutto impreparati a marzo 2020, ci ha inizialmente distanziati fisicamente, seppur uniti dal vivere tutti la difficile medesima esperienza, e ci ha portato ora alla polemica che ci divide ancor pi√π del distanziamento fisico. E‚Äô polemica aperta sulle scelte governative, regionali e comunali e ognuno dice la sua convinto di essere il portavoce dell‚Äôassoluta verit√†.Oggetto di discussione nel nostro territorio della Locride √® la chiusura o apertura della scuola e la polemica impazza attraverso qualunque strumento mediatico e non. Molti si sono fatti portavoce di un sentire, a loro dire, comune, ma c‚Äô√® chi ritiene, come me,che l‚Äôopinione a riguardo non sia unilaterale, ma pi√π complessa e diversificata. Io parlo come madre di un bambino che frequenta la scuola primaria del comprensorio di Siderno e come docente che non si √® sentita rappresentata da articoli giornalistici e da lettere di protesta che descrivono una comunit√† coesa nel protestare a favore della chiusura degli istituti scolastici. Sono tanti i genitori e tanti i docenti che hanno accolto favorevolmente la riapertura delle scuole, tanti sono coloro che credono che in questa fase particolare la scuola svolga un ruolo importante nel mantenere attive le menti e che sia importante che la trasmissione del sapere continui e soprattutto per i piccoli scolari √® fondamentale il rapporto diretto con gli insegnanti e i compagni di classe. Tanti sono anche gli alunni che hanno atteso la ripresa della didattica in presenza . La scuola, ad oggi, nel nostro territorio risulta essere un luogo pi√π sicuro rispetto ad altri dove sono avvenuti contagi sia tra bambini che adulti. Certo, nelle aule bisogna rispettare le regole di prevenzione e necessita che gli organi preposti adottino tempestivamente eventuali misure cautelari. Non scrivo per fomentare polemiche, ma, a seguito di recenti pubblicazioni, per testimoniare il parere di un‚Äôaltra parte di cittadini di Siderno e di molti che lavorano nella scuola.

Sinn F√©in President Mary Lou McDonald TD has called on the Taoiseach to publish an affordable housing plan before Christmas.
 Raising the housing crisis at Leaders‚Äô Questions today, Teachta McDonald criticised the failure of Housing Minister Darragh O'Brien to bring forward a plan despite months of promises.
 Teachta McDonald said:
 "The government cannot head off for Christmas without producing an affordable housing plan. For months, the Housing Minister told anybody who would listen that this would be produced by September. Here we are in December and there is no plan.
 "The Taoiseach's mantra of 'just getting on with' poorly thought-out housing developments, such as the one at Oscar Traynor Road, will not make housing affordable or accessible to workers on average incomes.
 "In fact, it is this very approach, which is all about profits for developers and big landlords, that created the housing mess we are in. The Taoiseach's position shows that this government is woefully out of touch with the reality of the crisis.
 "We cannot go on with off-the-wall house prices and sky-rocketing rents leaving workers and families in a housing dead-end.
 "The Taoiseach must dispense with the bluff on housing provision and deal with the real-life experiences of people.
 "We can fix housing but this requires ambition and a major change of policy. The Taoiseach must get real. People are waiting far too long for a proper housing package.
 "The Minister for Housing must publish an affordable housing plan before the D√°il breaks for Christmas."

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday hit out at his Punjab counterpart Captain Amrinder Singh for alleging that the Delhi government has passed the three farmer ordinances in Delhi, despite knowing that these three laws are passed by the Centre and it is not the prerogative of any State to implement or not implement such laws.
 Mr. Kejriwal asked Captain Singh not to indulge in ‚Äúdirty politics‚Äù on farmers‚Äô protests and added that that the allegations made by Captain Singh may be coming from his friendship with the BJP or he may be under pressure from the Centre to do so.
 Mr. Kejriwal added that he was also under tremendous pressure from the Centre to grant permission for the use of nine stadiums in Delhi to act as ‚Äújails‚Äù for the farmers, but he did not succumb to the pressure. ‚ÄúSince the time we refused to convert the nine stadiums in Delhi into temporary jails, the Central government is very upset with me. They had a plan of putting the farmers into these jails as soon as the farmers reach Delhi, and our refusal to convert these stadiums into jails have upset them,‚Äù Mr. Kejriwal said.
 He also said that Captain Singh had many chances to stop these farm bills as he was a member of committee to formulate and examine these bills, but did not stop these by raising objections in the committee itself.
 ‚ÄúWhy did you not intimate people about how the Centre is trying to bring in these black laws? The farmers of Punjab want to know why you did not stop these farm bills,‚Äù Mr. Kejriwal asked.
 In his press statement, Mr. Kejriwal requested everybody to support the farmers. ‚ÄúWhen some call the farmers ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô, ‚Äòanti-nationals‚Äô for protesting, I cannot imagine what the soldiers on the border must be going through, whose parents are being called terrorists.
