"The wealth of finds being discovered in the dig gives us a glimpse into the day-to-day lives of the residents of the ancient city. Among other things, we found cooking vessels made out of refined clay; dozens of oil lamps made of clay; a stone mug and a fragment of a vessel used to cleanse the hands and hold water that was used for some of the rituals of _taharah_ in the time of the Beis Mikdash," Monnickendam-Givon said.

BELLMAWR -- A gym in New Jersey reopened for business early Monday, defying a state order that shut down nonessential businesses to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 People began gathering outside the Atilis Gym in Bellmawr several hours before it reopened at 8 a.m. The owners have said the decision to resume operations at the members-only facility was not about financial gain, but rather a question of Constitutional rights.
   
 "We truly believe that if we don't do this, in the end, we will have zero rights and no say in what happens," co-owner Frank Trumbetti said in a video posted on the gym's Facebook page. Trumbetti has said he recently lost a loved one to the coronavirus.
   
 Dozens of people came out to show their support for the gym, with many holding signs critical of Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and others waving American flags. Only some were wearing face coverings and most people tightly clustered together on the sidewalk and parking area in front of the gym.
   
 "If they shut us down today, we'll reopen tomorrow," co-owner Ian Smith told the cheering crowd. The gym then saw a steady stream of customers as the morning progressed.
   
 Around 10:30 a.m., police approached the business and spoke with the gym owners. The officers informed them they were formally in violation of the shutdown order, adding that police were present "only for everybody's safety." The officers then wished everyone well and told them "have a nice day" before walking away from the gym as the crowd erupted in cheers.
   
 "They (the officers) actually surprised the hell out of me," Trumbetti said afterward, noting that they "did their job and upheld their oath ... and know that we are not doing anything wrong. It's about time for every police officer out there to understand we all have rights and, even as a police officer, you don't have to do this. It is unconstitutional. It's that simple. We have the right to work."
   
 Murphy said he wasn't concerned other businesses would begin to follow suit because the state is beginning to take steps to reopen. He did, however, suggest the state might take action if the defiance continues.
   
 "I'm not concerned it will spiral out of control, and we will take action," Murphy said Monday. "If you show up at that gym again tomorrow, there's going to be a different reality than showing up today. These aren't just words. We've got to enforce this, but I also don't want to start World War III."
   
 State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said the gym's owners were issued a court summons over the violation of the governor's shut-down executive order and clients were given a warning.
   
 Speaking outside the gym after the summonses were issued, the gym's owners told supporters that they shouldn't be concerned because the citations "are going to get thrown out because they're unconstitutional." They also rebuked those who criticized police for issuing the summonses, stating "they were only doing their jobs."
   
 Trumbetti urged other businesses to take similar stands and reopen, but noted the several steps the gym has taken in their efforts to ensure social distancing and protect patrons' safety.
   
 "Make sure you're compliant, you can't just open up and be a rebel," he said.
   
 Among the precautions the gym owners took were taping off workout stations and operating at 20% of the building's capacity, meaning about 44 patrons at a time. They also were requiring patrons to wear masks unless they were in the middle of lifting weights.
   
 Gym staff will be taking patrons' temperatures at the door and anyone at 100.4 or above will not be allowed inside. The gym's owners also said it wouldn't allow any new members to join Monday.

Kamel was also reportedly swept up in Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s anti- corruption purge in 2017. The unprecedented Saudi crackdown saw the country’s top princes and businessmen detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, with many forced to sign over billions of dollars in assets. The sweep, which was conducted largely in secret behind closed doors, helped the young crown prince consolidate power and was widely criticized by international rights groups.

Celtic was 13 points clear at the top of the table when matches were halted, after storming ahead as Rangers faltered following the winter break.   "We have scored 89 goals, conceded just 19 and established a commanding 13-point lead at the top of the table. We are champions for a reason," Celtic said in a statement.   Rangers fans will claim this title will always come with an asterisk attached. But for the blue half of the Glasgow divide, their focus must now be on stopping their rivals reaching the holy grail of 10 in a row next season.   Celtic's European Cup-winning side was unstoppable from 1965 to 1974, while Rangers' investment in a stellar cast of stars was rewarded from 1988 to 1997. For all those sides achieved, neither managed a full decade of dominance.   However, doubt remains over when the 2020/2021 season can even start and what the Scottish football landscape will look like.   According to UEFA's latest Club Licensing Benchmark report, gate receipts provide 43% of revenue for the 12 clubs in the Scottish Premiership, by far the highest proportion in Europe's top 20 leagues.   If a large portion of the season were played behind closed doors, that would hit Scottish clubs particularly hard.   Celtic is best set up to be able to ride out the economic storm, with their latest accounts showing cash reserves of 33 million pounds.   Rangers admitted in November to needing 10 million pounds in funding to see them through to the end of the season before the consequences of the pandemic were known.   Aberdeen chairman Dave Cormack has warned his club are burning through 1 million pounds a month and the Dons' turnover from the 2018/19 season was just under 16 million pounds, compared with Celtic's 83 million pounds.   Premiership clubs' desire not to jeopardize a new television contract with Sky that starts next season played a part in ending the season early.   However, even an improved deal is reportedly worth just 26 million pounds a season.   "Our middle-ranking Scottish Premiership club might get four times the money through the gate as it does through its TV contract, so the economics (of closed-doors games) don't work in Scotland," Scottish Football Association chairman Rod Petrie told the BBC.   Finance experts Begbies Traynor have predicted insolvencies among the hardest- hit clubs as "inevitable."   Celtic may be champions again, but there is little else that is business as usual for the Scottish game.

CAMDEN - A former Lenape High School student can pursue claims he faced racial discrimination and a hostile school environment while a member of the varsity football team, a federal judge has ruled.
   
 Kenya Williams Jr., who is black, contends in a lawsuit that he faced repeated instances of bias at the Medford school, including being targeted with racial slurs in the locker room and being denied playing time on the football team.
   
 U.S. District Judge Robert Kugler denied the Lenape Regional School District's request for summary judgment in a recent decision, finding sufficient evidence for the survival of some of Williams' claims.
   
 Among other points, Kugler's 41-page ruling noted evidence that school administrators "never took meaningful action to address the background harassment that pervaded the locker room" during Williams' time on the football team.
   
 Kugler said Williams, who was a running back for the Indians, could argue before a jury that he'd been denied playing time due to racial discrimination. But the judge added evidence in the case did not prove "conclusively" that coaching decisions were made due to bias.
   
 Michael Madden, an attorney for the school board and other defendants, said the district "remains confident in its position moving forward."
   
 While the district does not comment on pending litigation, Madden said, "What I can say from a procedural standpoint is that this is a decision on a summary application only, without the court receiving any actual factual testimony at a trial,"
   
 The Haddonfield attorney noted Kugler's ruling also dismissed several claims made by Williams. The Camden judge previously threw out all claims by Williams' parents, Florserido and Kenya Sr. of Mount Laurel, in a February 2018 ruling.
   
 Kugler also ruled Williams, whose suit seeks $1 million in compensatory damages, could also seek punitive damages
   
 "We're very thankful," Williams' attorney, Yvette Sterling of Mount Laurel, said of the May 4 ruling.
   
 Sterling said she hopes any resolution to the lawsuit includes "some very stringent changes and protocols to make sure this doesn't happen to other black students."
   
 The May 4 ruling also observed the defendants "dispute much of (Williams') version of events," but said Kugler "at this stage ... must assume the truth of (Williams') account."
   
 Defendants include Carol Birnbohm, the regional district's superintendent, and Tony Cattani, Lenape's principal.
   
 The lawsuit, filed in August 2017, alleges repeated incidents of discrimination and harassment at the school between 2015 and 2017.
   
 Kugler's ruling said school officials responded "promptly" and "swiftly" to several bias complaints, taking disciplinary actions against several students. It also noted the district at one point assigned an employee to "shadow" Williams on Lenape's Hartford Road campus as a precautionary measure against harassment.
   
 But Kugler also pointed to "evidence that defendants turned a blind eye to (Williams') initial complaint of locker room harassment and never acted to fully address the problem, despite his repeated complaints of abuse."
   
 According to his ruling, when Williams' parents and others complained about locker-room slurs at a September 2015 meeting, school officials "brushed their concerns aside."
   
 An investigation launched after the meeting focused "only on on whether the coaches were awarding playing time in a racially discriminatory way," the decision noted.
   
 It said investigators, who found no sign of bias in playing-time decisions, looked into the locker room's atmosphere only after another complaint in October 2015.
   
 At that point, the judge said, investigators for the district concluded the locker room's atmosphere was "'comfortable and non-offensive,' despite finding widespread evidence of the use of racial slurs."
   
 Kugler also discounted the school's defense that it had an "outside professional" speak to players about mutual respect after the October 2015 complaint. It noted the speaker made regular appearances before the team "and would have given this address in 2015 whether or not (Williams) had ever complained of racial harassment."
   
 "In light of this evidence, a reasonable jury could find that the school's response (to bias complaints) was unreasonable," Kugler said.

You are obviously spending a lot of time at home. Even with the work-from-home routine and all the video calls happening, this probably is the first time in your life when you have spent so much time with your spouse. You may have also witnessed how the partnership has worked beautifully while handling household chores. So, why not extend this partnership while managing your finances and investments?Men have usually been the ones making investment decisions due to societal conditioning. However, studies conducted worldwide suggest that women make more responsible investors than men. Women tend to have a more conservative, patient, and disciplined style of investing and prefer moderate but consistent returns over a longer period of time. So, dear men and women, investing is not for men alone. This needs a partnership and this is the best time to start with some investment chores together. Here's what you should do.Prioritise your expensesWomen are more tuned to the needs of the household. They are the ones managing budgets and expenses, and squeezing out savings to build an emergency corpus of their own. So, sit down with your partner and review your household budgets. Start prioritizing your expenses in order to avoid wasteful expenditure. For eg., you may realise that buying household stuff online or buying in large quantities could give you huge savings. And these small savings may have the potential to turn into a large corpus if invested well.Review your goals togetherWomen are in charge at home even when it comes to children's schooling, grooming or potential career choices. And they have a huge stake in a post-retirement life as well. So, in every sense, you have a knowledgeable partner at home who should be brought to the financial planning table immediately. Chart out both your short- and long- term goals with your partner. A discussion with your partner will help bring more clarity to your goals.Take a balanced investment approachInvesting as a couple is quite different from investing as an individual. This is because your risk appetite and investment preference may differ from that of your partner. Investing as a couple involves arriving at a consensus and taking a joint investing decision. Consulting a financial advisor with your spouse can help bring further clarity to your thinking and planning. We also suggest looking at mutual funds. With the choices they offer, mutual funds can help you get the desired investment portfolio aligned to your budget, goals, and r risk profile. And with that, they will also offer you the flexibility for a periodic review and realignment.It is a no secret that two heads are better than one. Involving your partner in investment chores is not just sensible, but also responsible. So, go ahead and use this responsible option today.
