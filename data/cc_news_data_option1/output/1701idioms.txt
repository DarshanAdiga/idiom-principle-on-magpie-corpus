A culture that celebrates successful outcomes and devalues the efforts made despite failing to achieve an end result has difficulty overcoming community- wide crises because many, if not all, of the potential outcomes are considered failures. Serving as a cybersecurity executive and as a youth soccer coach has taught me that, just like in business, conditions outside of our control sometimes require that we help children focus on factors other than end results to build their resilience against adversity. That will help them establish a stronger foundation for a more confident pursuit of sustainable success.

Some were worried enough about the grim news coming out of the Pacific Northwest that they decided to skip the tournament. As they sat down at the blue-topped card tables, people in a Seattle-area nursing home were being rushed to a hospital with fevers and coughs, and the nation’s death count from the coronavirus, still in the single digits, was ticking up.
 Colorado would not announce its first coronavirus cases until March 5, and like most states, it was not yet restricting businesses or social gatherings or ordering people to stay home. Rapp, 65, who ran some of the games, dug around in the clubhouse closet and set out hand sanitizer.
 About 150 people showed up to play during those five days from Feb. 27 to March 3. During one hand, a woman shielded her face with cards when an opponent sighed heavily.
 “We were aware of coronavirus cases popping up,” Rapp said. “The people who wanted to play came to play.”

Some airline unions and U.S. lawmakers have urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require facial coverings for all passengers and crew.
 United said it will provide complimentary masks to passengers. Southwest Airlines Co, one of the largest U.S. airlines, has not required facial coverings.
 The FAA has declined to implement the requirement, and it is not clear if the agency has the authority to compel passengers to wear face masks. The FAA said Wednesday it is "working with air carriers to ensure they have processes in place for addressing public health risks for their crews and passengers."
 Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation Committee, called on the FAA Wednesday to "require masks or other face coverings for all crewmembers and passengers on U.S. flights" and to require airlines "adopt reasonable, sound procedures for ensuring that passengers are spaced at safe distances from one another."
 Delta said the airline will require face coverings "starting in the check-in lobby" and at "Delta Sky Clubs, boarding gate areas, jet bridges and on board the aircraft for the duration of the flight - except during meal service."
 Delta added their use "is also strongly encouraged in high-traffic areas, including security lines and restrooms. People unable to keep a face covering in place, including children, are exempt."
 American said the rules will prioritize "customer and team member well-being."
 German airline group Lufthansa also said this week it would require facial coverings for all passengers starting May 4.
 Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, praised the carriers adopting the requirements and added "absent federal action, we need every airline to require passengers wear face coverings to keep everyone safe in aviation."

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — With initial White House social-distancing guidelines expiring on Thursday, about half the U.S. states were pressing ahead with plans to ease restrictions on businesses and social life, aiming to revive economies stalled by coronavirus while keeping people safe.
 The enormous pressure on states to reopen was highlighted by fresh Labor Department data showing around 30 million people had sought unemployment benefits since March 21, or more than 18.4% of the working-age population.
 Some states are planning to ease restrictions without the “Opening Up America Again” safeguards that the Trump administration itself had recommended on April 16, including declines in the infection rate and expanded virus testing.
 The safeguards sought to give states some parameters for relaxing restrictions.
 Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned states not to move too fast, a refrain of many public health officials since states, led by Georgia, started relaxing restrictions.
 “You can’t just leap over things to a situation where you’re really tempting (the virus) to rebound. That’s the thing I get concerned about. I hope they don’t do that,” Fauci, a White House coronavirus task force member, told NBC’s “Today” show.
 The number of coronavirus cases is still climbing in many parts of the country, although peaks appear to have been reached in New York state, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, and other places.
 Kansas, Virginia and Arizona reported a record number of new cases, while Minnesota reported a record number of new cases for the second day in a row. Washington, D.C., posted a record number of deaths. The total number of U.S. deaths has topped 61,000, with well over 1 million confirmed cases.
 Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives, said that many states still do not have enough testing capacity, which most experts say is a prerequisite for a safe reopening.
 “What will give people confidence to go into the work force — (is) that they know that their coworkers had been tested and cleared to be there,” Pelosi said at a news conference.
 PATCHWORK
 In the latest of a patchwork of announcements made across the country over the past several days, Florida on Wednesday became one of the largest states to ease some of the restrictions that have crippled business activity.
 “There is a light at the end of the tunnel,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said as he unveiled his phase-one plan due to start on Monday to relax the mandatory workplace closures and stay-at-home orders imposed four weeks ago.
 Texas unveiled a similar reopening strategy to take effect on Friday. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy plans to allow state parks and golf courses to reopen on Saturday.
 In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the closure of Orange County beaches and parks in the southern part of the state after crowds jammed the popular shoreline last weekend.
 A Democrat, Newsom has said that curbside retail, manufacturing and other “lower-risk workplaces” should reopen in California within weeks as testing and contact-tracing improve.
 Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer requested an extension to a state of emergency in Michigan due to expire on Thursday.
 Republican lawmakers in her state oppose the extension, and hundreds gathered inside the state Capitol to protest against the move, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with signs supporting Republican President Donald Trump.
 In a sign that the worst may be over in hard-hit New York, the 1,000-bed hospital ship Comfort steamed out of Manhattan on Thursday after a month-long stay.
 The Navy vessel, painted a gleaming white with red crosses, was a symbol of hope when it arrived on March 30 to absorb an anticipated crush of patients that, under the most dire projections, could have overwhelmed hospitals.
 With the success of stay-at-home orders and social distancing, the extra capacity was never needed, allowing the ship to return to its home base in Norfolk, Va.
 Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York would hire thousands of people to trace the contacts of people who test positive for the coronavirus. He also announced a halt to New York City subway service from 1 to 5 a.m. to disinfect trains.

A new apartment complex being built in Eau Claire got $483,430 in low-income tax credits, which will ensure that a portion of its units will be affordable to people making well below the area’s median income.
 Cannery Trail Residences made the Wisconsin Housing & Economic Development Authority’s list this week of 34 projects in the state that will receive a total of $31.9 million in tax credits to help create more affordable housing.
 “In order to make the development feasible and financeable we needed to be able to get those tax credits,” said developer Tyler Warner of W Capital Group.
 The tax credits will be sold to private investors who help fund Phase 2 of the Cannery Trail Residences. Slated for construction next year, that building will include 43 apartments with 36 of them reserved for people making 30% to 60% of Eau Claire County’s median income.
 Phase 1 of the project already is under construction with 71 market-rate apartments already being built along North Oxford Avenue in Eau Claire’s Cannery District. Leases will soon be signed for those apartments, which are scheduled to be ready for occupancy on Aug. 15, according to Warner.
 Along with the tax credits administered by the state, Cannery Trail Residences, which is being built in an area Eau Claire is working to redevelop, is eligible for up to $800,000 in incentives from the city.
 Progress on the Phase 1 building has already hit benchmarks for the developer to receive $250,000 of those incentives from the city, according to finance director Jay Winzenz. When the building gets its first tenants, another $50,000 will be paid out to the developer.
 The remaining $500,000 in city incentives are tied into Phase 2, with $200,000 of that specifically for meeting affordable housing quotas the developer has promised.
 Tuesday’s announcement of the tax credits provided momentum the developers sought toward their goals to create affordable housing in Eau Claire.
 “The tax credits from WHEDA were the lion’s share of what we needed to get started,” said Chris Laurent, president of Cinnaire Solutions, who is working with W Capital Group on Phase 2 of the Cannery Trail Residences.
 But two other projects developers planned in Eau Claire that also sought the tax credits did not make WHEDA’s list of recipients.
 La Crosse-based Gerrard Development had envisioned a four-story building with 80 apartments and some commercial space along a high bank of the Eau Claire River on the city’s east side.
 Not getting the $1.15 million in tax credits the project had sought has likely doomed it.
 “That project is completely dead,” said Paul Gerrard, vice president of Gerrard Development.
 Of the building’s 80 units, 68 would’ve been reserved for low-income tenants, and Gerrard said 15% of the apartments would’ve specifically gone to people who are currently homeless.
 Though he didn’t rule out some kind of building project still happening at the vacant land on the northeast corner of Birch Street and River Prairie Drive, Gerrard indicated that missing out on the tax credits was a huge setback.
 West CAP was also part of the project and Peter Kilde, that community action agency’s executive director, said he’s still got hope that the team could still find another affordable housing project to do in Eau Claire.
 “We haven’t given up on that idea,” he said.
 Gerrard and West CAP did get a victory on a different project on Tuesday, receiving $623,600 in tax credits for a 50-unit building in New Richmond that will be entirely affordable housing.
 A total of 64 projects throughout Wisconsin had requested $61 million in tax credits, vying against each other for the finite amount of money available through WHEDA.
 “It’s extremely competitive,” Kilde said.
 Another Eau Claire project that didn’t make the cut was an application from an Illinois company to convert a defunct nursing home into affordable housing for seniors. EREG Development failed to get the $1.22 million in tax credits it sought for major renovation to the former Mt. Washington Residence, according to WHEDA’s list.

The new details emerge as violence and political infighting in Kabul threaten to scuttle a Taliban peace deal with the U.S. Last month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced frustrations after a failed attempt to mediate a power struggle between Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and political rival Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. The Trump administration said it would cut $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan.
 Washington has urged Kabul to release Taliban prisoners, which is part of the peace agreement, arguing the detainees were at risk of spreading the coronavirus.
 But there are no public indications that Frerichs, a Navy veteran, has been part of negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban leadership or that his release is part of any peace deal.
 “The Taliban kidnapped my brother in January. In February, the U.S. signed a peace deal with the Taliban. My brother wasn’t part of the deal. Now we are arranging for the Taliban and Afghan government to exchange thousands of prisoners,” Charlene Cakora, one of Frerichs’ sisters, said in a statement provided to the AP. “Why can’t we make an American hostage be one of them?”
 Frerichs' father, Art, said in a statement that though he has faith in President Donald Trump and Pompeo, “I just need them to tell their people negotiating with the Taliban that America won’t lift a finger until my son comes home. He’s a veteran. This is America. We don’t leave people behind.”
 The Pentagon and U.S. Special Operations Command declined to comment on the SEALs' raid. The rescue effort is being coordinated through the FBI-led, multiagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, which said in a statement that it was working with its partners to ensure “that Mark Frerichs and all Americans held hostage abroad are returned home.” It encouraged anyone with information about the case to come forward.
 The State Department said it was aware of an American who’d been abducted in Afghanistan.
 “The welfare, safety and security of Americans is the Trump Administration’s highest priority,” the department said. “The United States will continue to push for the safe return of this and all other U.S citizens through all relevant channels.”

“I have not received any information about him,” said a Taliban source who asked not to be named. “There has been no clue despite my contacts with every side to get information.”
 In November, the Afghan government released three prominent members of the Haqqani network in exchange for an American citizen and an Australian professor abducted in 2016. Pompeo characterized the prisoner swap as a “goodwill gesture.”
 Rep. Michael Waltz, a Florida Republican and Army veteran who led the teams that searched for Bowe Bergdahl after the Army soldier abandoned his post in 2009 and wound up captured by the Taliban, said the Taliban frequently hides American hostages until they can move them over the border into Pakistan.
 He said peace deal negotiations should have stopped as soon as the U.S. government learned that Frerichs was missing.
 “I have real concerns about suggestions that the Taliban are serious about peace, that the Taliban are upholding their end of the deal when — as we speak today — they are holding a former Navy veteran and American citizen hostage that they took, again, during the peace negotiations,” Waltz said in an interview.
 The search area for Frerichs began in Khost and extended south to the province of Kandahar, according to a senior U.S. government official and a second official at the Defense Department.
 Members of the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group, more familiarly known as SEAL Team Six, who were involved in the Frerichs effort had spent late January working to recover the bodies of two American service members who died when their aircraft crash-landed in Ghazni in central Afghanistan, according to the two U.S. officials.
 The bitter winter weather that limited overhead surveillance of the airplane wreckage by U.S. military drones also worked against officials during the later SEAL operation on the night of Feb. 3. Periods of poor-to-nonexistent visibility ultimately delayed a planned intelligence-gathering operation on a known Taliban location, said the senior U.S. government official, who has direct knowledge of the raid.
 Once the weather cleared, the SEALs loaded onto helicopters and flew to the undisclosed location. The senior official declined to disclose the exact location of the province for operational security reasons.

At an April 27 press conference, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his stay-at-home order would expire April 30, and introduced Phase 1 for reopening the Texas economy.
 First to open on Friday will be restaurants, retail businesses, movie theaters, and malls, limited to 25% capacity. Museums and libraries will also be allowed to open at 25% capacity, but hands-on exhibits must remain closed for now.
 Abbott added that counties with five or fewer COVID-19 cases could increase their capacity to 50% after submitting a form to the state for approval.
 On May 1, churches - already opened - may expand their capacity as long as safe distancing is practiced.
 Hair and nail salons, barber shops, gyms, and bars must remain closed until at least mid-May, when Abbott hopes to have those businesses up and running as long as the state doesn’t see an increase in COVID-19 cases.
 He stressed that his order “supersedes all local orders.”
 Abbott also noted his order “gives permission to reopen, but not a requirement,” and a business could remain closed if it chose.
 Outdoor sports are allowed as long as they involve no more than four participants playing together at a time.
 All licensed healthcare professionals, including dentists, can return to work, but hospitals must reserve 15% capacity for COVID-19 patients.
 Testing remains a priority, and Abbott said the testing and tracing process put in place Monday could “quickly identify any flare-ups in COVID-19.”

 No one signed up for this. None of us was prepared for the dramatic shift in our day-to-day "normal." I know I did not sign up to home-school my two children; no matter how much I love them, teaching them is a whole other ballgame.
 One of the hardest parts of this experience is avoiding comparing my efforts with those I see when scrolling through my social-media feeds. I am not the crafty type of parent -- no Martha Stewart here -- and I don't have an ounce of musical talent or skill.
 And I desperately want to be the "fun" mom. But that is just not me. I will not get to the other side of this by trying to change any of that.
 My partner, on the other hand, encompasses all those things; he is musical, creative, sporty and definitely has nailed the role of "fun" dad.
 Through this experience, I learned quickly that my family works best with structure, and not just a little; they need a solid and consistent daily routine. Early days, I left this too wide open for my kids, and it was a clear parenting fail.
 My partner stepped up and created something that works for us. There is balance between (computer) screens for learning and fun; getting outside and active; connecting with others, through daily video calls with friends and family, or letter writing to heroes in our communities; and capturing art and music wherever and whenever possible.
 I look forward to wrapping up the day with our version of music appreciation. My partner picks an album from our collection to listen to while our kiddos research the musicians and the specific record, and consider what they like or dislike about the album. We've listened to everything from Beach Boys to Run DMC, Tina Turner to Led Zeppelin, Mac Miller to Cat Stevens.
 While music has always been in the background of many moments in our home, this new ritual makes us pause, listen, reflect and expand on what we think about a song, album or musician. Before, we weren't taking the time to appreciate an album from beginning to end. It was about listening to the one or two hit songs from an artist, not experiencing the full ride that a great set of songs can take you on when you really stop and hear the music and all that is behind it. Researching the albums has opened a door to a discussion about music that wasn't there for us before. It helps our kids learn that there is much more to something than what is immediately visible.
 Over the last few weeks, I have learned that our kids have eclectic tastes. It's something we have in common. Our son likes jazz, Motown and rock … music that gets him up and dancing. Our daughter appreciates singer-songwriters, alongside the hits of today.
 I find so much joy in hearing them talk about their thoughts and feelings about music, and putting the experience of a song into words and on paper. This has introduced them to artists they might not have taken the time to hear before and honed their own musical identities. Plus, it is just simply fun.
 Right now, it is all too easy for parenting worries, fears and guilt about not having enough time, patience or knowledge to rear their ugly heads. I can get caught up in the "not enough" moments, rather than seeing this for what it can be.
 Will my kids fail in life because of this time? Not likely. They will grow and appreciate the memories of laughing, playing and slowing down together, dancing and singing along to our favourite songs in the kitchen while making supper, rather than rushing in and out the door at the end of the day to get to the next activity.
 This is our experience of the new "normal" for how ever long it lasts, and it is our best.

His family lived in an Army-issued tent for two years as a result of the displacement. When his family moved into a town -- Suzack's first brush with city life -- he labelled it as "culture shock," the decision stated.
 Racism and discrimination dogged Suzack from then on.
 At 15, Suzack was "arrested and beaten by police, then torn from his family and community and placed into a non-Indigenous group home," the decision stated.
 "Suzack experienced violence from authority figures and was exposed to negative peer pressure and initiated into alcohol," the decision noted.
 "A year and a half later, Suzack ran away from the group home and joined Indigenous people staging political protests. At the same time, a sister killed herself and another cousin was killed in a police  shooting."
 Since then, Suzack "exhibited continuous and violent behaviour" to preserve his image as a "tough guy."
 He racked up five convictions for assault causing bodily harm, eight for assault and another for aggravated assault, unlawful confinement and robbery.
 His criminality is blamed upon his associates, attitude and substance abuse.
 But he has stayed sober -- with all urinalysis tests coming back negative -- and he admitted most of his crimes occurred while he was intoxicated.

CENTREVILLE — While COVID-19 has been the major topic of discussion over the past month, the visual and performing artists in Queen Anne’s County Public Schools continue bringing smiles to everyone’s faces, according to Michael Bell, supervisor of visual and performing arts.
 “They remind us all that there’s still much to have ‘high hopes’ about, despite the many hardships families may be facing. And, there’s no one better equipped to bring out those smiles than our talented children and teachers,” Bell said.
 In an encore performance to “Times Like These” that dropped last week on the QACPS YouTube Channel, children of all ages banded together with Performing Arts teachers to sing and dance to the song “High Hopes” by Panic! At the Disco.
 The video starts out with Bell promoting his teachers’ great accomplishments this year at a Feb. 8 broadcast on TV Delmarva’s Coastal A&E with host Michael Sprouse, while sharing an important message for his teachers to “stay artists.” From there, a talented young singer from Bayside Elementary kicks off “High Hopes,” joined by 2020 Teacher of the Year finalist Amber Wright, Kent Island High School senior dance star Abby Scaggs, and late in the video Gabby Pfeifer — 2020 All-State Award-winning dancer —makes a grand appearance.
 “Despite the pandemic, our children are still taking to the streets with inspiring messages as sidewalk chalk drawings, making personal art as tribute pieces to our healthcare heroes, and performing through creative mediums of song and dance,” Bell said.

Coronavirus-induced stay-at-home orders and the cancellation of South by Southwest have sent overall crime rates plummeting, Austin Police Department data show.
   
 Austin posted the fewest number of arrests in the month of March for at least four years, according to an American-Statesman analysis of Austin crime data. Officers made 2,659 arrests this March, a 14% decrease from March 2019 and a 32% decrease from March 2018. Some of the largest declines include a 75% drop in traffic warrant arrests, to 33 arrests this March from 132 arrests in March 2019. A similar drop was also seen in the number of those arrested and charged with possession of marijuana.
   
 But it's not all good news.
   
 Family violence arrests jumped 17% to 252, compared with March 2019 when there were 215. Victims advocates have sounded the alarm that as people are being forced to shelter at home and the stresses associated with the pandemic mount, cases could surge.
   
 Likely spurred by the unprecedented cancellation of SXSW that typically brings thousands of visitors and the shelter-in-place order that began March 24, the overall decline in crime rates started mid-month and stayed that way. Police expect to see the same trend in April.
   
 "There are less people out on the street. There are less people driving," said Austin police Lt. Scott Perry. "And there's less interaction of the police with citizens just because there aren't as many of them out there right now."
   
 Drop in nonviolent arrests
   
 The department has also changed the way it responds to calls for service. Although there are the same number of officers on the streets, they are not responding in-person to lower-priority calls, such as fender benders that do not involve injuries or reports of people in serious danger, Perry said. Police are also receiving fewer calls for service because fewer people are out on the roads, he said.
   
 "Fewer people out and about means fewer contacts with police officers, Perry said. "Which, in turn, will decrease the number of arrests that occur."
   
 The decline in arrests also comes amid changes in Austin Police Department policies. In 2018, department officials moved to a cite-and-release model to curb the number of misdemeanor arrests. March 2017 and March 2018 show significantly more arrests, compared with subsequent years.
   
 On March 20, District Court judges in Travis County temporarily suspended active arrest warrants for certain non-violent crimes -- such as graffiti, possession of marijuana and theft -- to reduce the local jail population and the spread of the coronavirus. Some local judges had also approved no-cash bonds to help in the reduction of jail population and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Recently, the Texas Supreme Court sided with Gov. Greg Abbott, who issued an executive order to exclude from the no-cash bonds anyone accused of a violent offense or who has a violent past.
   
 There were 2,164 individuals in Travis County jails on March 16. By March 31, the number had dwindled to 1,670.
   
 Property crime arrests, which includes burglaries and thefts, for March saw a slight decrease compared to last year's figures, from 237 to 223. Drilling down into the figures, auto theft arrests, which were not exempt from the warrant suspension order, jumped, from 35 arrests in March 2019 to 56 this year.
   
 Dangerous households
   
 While the total number of arrests in March were lower than previous years, domestic violence arrests increased 17% since March 2018, including 10 more arrests stemming from strangulation and suffocation. Strangulation is considered one of the most severe domestic abuse crimes and is a felony because studies have found that defendants who choke their victims are more likely to kill them.
   
 Victims advocates fear that the social isolation and the pressures related to the pandemic and stay-at-home orders will make already abusive households more prone to violence. At least one domestic violence-related death has been reported since the pandemic restrictions went into place.
   
 The Austin-based National Domestic Violence Hotline has reported that people are feeling the pressures of COVID-19. From March 16 to April 20, a total of 3,829 contacts to the hotline cited COVID-19 as a condition of their experience. As of last week, the hotline has received 316 contacts from Texans who have cited COVID-19 as a condition of their experience.
   
 "But as far as family violence goes, continuing to be at a normal or maybe even higher than normal rates is really not a surprise from my perspective," said Antwon Martin, spokesperson for the SAFE Alliance, which offers shelter and services to Central Texans in abusive households or relationships. "Wherever there are power and control dynamics to be exploited, there'll be people who abuse others. And now, our collective fear is that it's getting worse."
   
 Martin said the total number of calls for service spiked shortly after the stay-at-home order went into effect, but the volume has since leveled off. But SAFE Alliance, which also serves people who have been sexually assaulted or trafficked, said the proportion of calls for family violence and child abuse has increased.
   
 "It's awful, but the running theory on that is that people reached out to support while they could. They called us when they saw the shelter-in-place order go into effect and they potentially would have to stay in the home with an abusive partner or caregiver," Martin said. "And now they can no longer find a safe place to make that call."

Alrededor del 72% de los despidos masivos relacionados con el coronavirus están en la industria hotelera y de restaurantes, así como en el sector de las artes, el entretenimiento y la recreación, y el 42% en la región de Florida Central, incluida el área de Tampa Bay.
 Los mayores recortes: más de 1,400 trabajadores en _Feld Entertainment_ , la productora de espectáculos detrás de _Disney on Ice_ y _Monster Jam_ ; 1,206 en el YMCA; 835 en el _Four Seasons Orlando_ en _Walt Disney World_ ; 684 en el Aeropuerto Internacional de Miami; y 560 en el _Trump National Doral Miami Resort_.
 Se espera que los números crezcan. Se basan en avisos requeridos por el gobierno federal que las empresas deben presentar ante el estado en caso de un despido que afecte a 500 o más empleados, o 50 o más empleados si son al menos un tercio de la fuerza laboral, así como los permisos que se espera que duren seis meses o más El Departamento de Oportunidades Económicas mantiene los datos, que se actualizan en tiempo real a medida que el estado recibe los avisos, y está cambiando rápidamente.
 Los números no incluirán a los más de 70,000 trabajadores de _Disney_ que fueron despedidos a partir de esta semana, dijo Disney.
 El Departamento de Oportunidades Económicas (DEO, siglas en inglés) no retiene una copia de los avisos de despido de la recesión, conocida como la Ley de notificación de ajuste y retención de trabajadores o WARN, pero según un informe de _Orlando Sentinel_ de finales de 2009, el número de empresas que presentaron avisos alcanzó su punto máximo ese año en marzo con 36 limaduras.
 En marzo de 2020, hubo 126 solicitudes relacionadas solo con coronavirus.
 Los números son el reflejo más actualizado de la situación en Florida. Las cifras de desempleo más recientes aún no han reflejado las peores semanas de pérdida de empleos y los datos de reclamos de desempleo del estado probablemente no reportan la magnitud del problema porque miles de trabajadores han luchado por postularse en el sistema de Florida, que ha sido ampliamente criticado por sus deficiencias técnicas. .
 A nivel nacional, aproximadamente 1 de cada 10 trabajadores que solicitaron desempleo la semana pasada eran floridanos, o 505,000 personas, según el Departamento de Trabajo de los EE. UU.

Her organization is one of the biggest groups representing private schools and daycares in Ontario. OFIS represents roughly 10 per cent of the nearly 1,400 private schools in the province.
 "Getting a wage subsidy isn't the only answer, but it's definitely going to help at least keep us going and be part of the solution going forward, rather than just shutting our doors and adding to the problem," Dervaitis added.
 Finance Minister Bill Morneau's office did not answer a question as to why private schools were excluded from the CEWS program. But a spokesperson did not shut the door on a possible revision of the benefit to eventually include private schools and universities.
 "Our Government has been steadfast in ensuring that Canadians impacted by COVID-19 receive the help they need as quickly as possible. We already made changes to make the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy more flexible for start-ups, high-growth businesses, charities, and not-for-profits. As we have said from the beginning, we will continue to take action as necessary to ensure Canadians have the help they need during this challenging time," Maeva Proteau responded by email.
 If changes don't come, both Bowles and Dervaitis fear that private schools will be ill-equipped financially come the start of the next school year if parents decide to save money and send their children to the public system.
 "Enrolment for some students next year may be questionable," Devaitis said. "This completely disrupts all our planning for our business. For some schools, the question is now: is it viable to stay open, is it even worth it?"

Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler reportedly made _Very Cavallari_ star Kristin Cavallari "cry all the time" while she filmed her reality series. The couple announced plans to divorce late Sunday after a decade of marriage. Since then, reports on what went wrong have continued to surface, with cheating allegations coming out and more details about how Cutler allegedly treated Cavallari behind the scenes.
 "He would make her cry all the time during production. He talked down to her and belittled her," a Cavallari friend told _PEOPLE_ Thursday. "She couldn't take it anymore." Another source told the magazine the former couple was "struggling" for "at least three years" and has been unhappy for a long time. _PEOPLE_ reached out to Cutler's lawyer, but there was no response for comment.
 "He belittles Kristin and makes her cry in front of other people," the second source, also close to Cavallari, said. "He flies off the handle at the littlest thing and would make Kristin absolutely miserable." However, the couple tried to stay together for their cchildren, Camden, 7, Jaxon, 5, and Saylor, 4. "She just wants to be happy and to be a good mom," a source told _PEOPLE_. "They tried to make it work for the kids, but Kristin realized Jay is not going to change."
 Back on Sunday, Cavallari, 33, and Cutler, 37, announced plans to divorce. "With great sadness, after 10 years together we have come to a loving conclusion to get a divorce," they wrote in a statement they shared on their Instagram pages. "We have nothing but love and respect for one another and are deeply grateful for the years shared, memories made, and the children we are so proud of. This is just the situation of two people growing apart. We ask everyone to respect our privacy as we navigate this difficult time within our family."

 In the divorce filings, Cavallari and her lawyers wrote that Cutler is "guilty of such inappropriate marital conduct as renders further cohabitation unsafe and improper." The filing added that "any misconduct alleged or implied against [Cavallari] in the complaint for divorce was in response to and/or as a result of misconduct on behalf of the Husband." It is not clear what exactly "marital misconduct" is in this case, based on the documents. Cavallari listed April 7 as the date of the separation, weeks before Cutler's date in his filings. Cavallari also cited "inappropriate marital conduct" as the reason for the divorce, instead of "irreconcilable differences."
 Once source told _Us Weekly_ the couple accused each other of cheating before filing for divorce. Another source told _PEOPLE_ they were talking about a split "for awhile" but held off because of the children. In November, Cavallari reportedly signed a contract for a new property in Franklin, Tennessee, just south of Nashville.

Here is where I definitely part company with Lindley, and to some extent with Hossenfelder. The current problems with fundamental physics have nothing to do with mathematical abstraction, but with the refusal to give up on bad physical ideas that don't work. Thirty-six years ago Witten and many other leaders of the field fell in love not with a mathematical abstraction, but with a bad physical idea: replace fundamental particles with fundamental strings. One reason they fell in love with this idea was that it could be fit together with two other bad ideas they had been dallying with at the time, that there are new forces mixing leptons and quarks (GUTs), and that you can relate bosons and fermions with the square root of translation symmetry (SUSY).

Sprenger said the plan has been in the works for the past year. In the next few months the airport will begin holding public meetings on the plan and its alternatives, which will be announced on bozemanairport.com.
 “What it really does is makes us take a good hard look at what projections of passengers and air traffic will be and make sure that we have the right facility needs to accommodate that,” Sprenger said. “A lot of the things we’ve done in the past 10 years were all part of our last master plan.”
 The Bozeman airport, like others around the country, has seen a massive drop in passengers because of COVID-19 and related travel restrictions. Sprenger said the Bozeman airport is seeing about 5% of the passengers it normally would during the spring and will likely stay around that number until later phases of Gov. Steve Bullock’s plan to re-open the state. Those phases don’t yet have a timetable.
 Even then, Sprenger said, it may be a while before passenger numbers return.
 “The leadership has been taken by individual states and governors for individual states on how to reopen, and while that makes a lot of sense for individual states and how they do that, it is extremely difficult when you expand that to a nationwide opening of travel,” he said. “People have to really research what they can and can’t do on an individual basis.”
 Despite the virus, Sprenger said the airport is still expecting a growth in passenger numbers in the coming decade and the master plan is being crafted to accommodate that forecast.
 “We’re still optimistic that we will see substantial increases in passengers and economic throughput for the region,” he said. “We have to plan for the future.”
