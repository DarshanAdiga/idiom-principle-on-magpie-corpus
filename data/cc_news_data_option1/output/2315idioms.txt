Over the past two days, the culture minister denounced the decision to cancel a Paris showing of “Gone With the Wind” — a film long criticized as romanticizing slavery — as contrary to freedom of expression. And he firmly condemned activists who tried to take a piece of African art from a Paris museum dedicated to artwork from former colonies.

The placement’s success and strong subscription rate despite the difficult global economic conditions, reflect the attractiveness of AFC as a gateway to Africa’s infrastructure and industrial opportunities for institutional capital, and will finance the value accretive beneficiation of Africa’s primary commodities as well as create jobs for Africa’s youth.”

Months later, Terriquez made a point to bring up the March 5 panel when speaking to the Arizona Daily Sun about the reality doctors have seen on the front lines of COVID-19.

 Terriquez said he based his answer on available information about similar viruses, and what experts knew about this new strain of the coronavirus that had never been heard of before December 2019.

Before Goldstein chauffeured the passengers aboard, another employee sprayed down the seats and guardrails with soapy water and then wiped them off.
 Jenny Lake Boating is staging only three of its four vessels at its namesake lake, having for now left its largest boat on dry ground. Based on Colonel’s guess at his first-day ticket sales — about half of the usual 500 to 700 passengers for an early June weekday — the operation doesn’t yet need the fourth boat.
 Otherwise, all is about normal for the tour and shuttle boat business, whose rides to the 1,191-acre lake’s scenic western shoreline have proved to be a premiere pit stop activity for Grand Teton Park’s millions of road trippers.
 The dearth of crowds at Jenny Lake Boating and elsewhere in Grand Teton has been one notable change in the early going of a summer season that’s poised to be unlike any other.
 While the national park through Monday had declined to release its official visitor counts for the spring, neighboring Yellowstone National Park has made its data available — and it’s likely a good barometer of local tourism figures. In the last two weeks of May, traffic flows through Yellowstone’s south and east gates (the only entrances open at that time) were 70% of last year’s traffic for the same dates.
 Only time will tell if traffic ticks back up near volumes seen in recent summers. But in the meantime some tourists are making the best of a less- peopled national park experience in northwest Wyoming.
 When Goldstein, the senior pilot, launched the first public shuttle boat of the season at 7 a.m. Friday, he was captaining a ship holding an obviously light payload: a family of four from Houston who enjoyed an experience, just them, often shared by three dozen people.
 Then again, that exclusive Jenny Lake Boating shuttle ride isn’t all that uncommon, regardless of the year. Just rise and show up early.
 “Early in the morning, anytime between 7 and 8 a.m., that’s not rare,” Goldstein said. “We don’t want to make people wait more than 10 minutes, so we’ll just keep sending boats and that can happen.”
