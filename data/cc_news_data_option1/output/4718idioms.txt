I probably had been working on the research no more than a year, probably less. I was asleep at home, and all of a sudden, I woke up. I sensed this presence crouched in the corner of my bedroom. The presence was lifting her arm and her index finger and speaking and exhorting me and scolding me. I knew who it was, and I was terrified. I got up out of bed, and my heart was pounding. I walked out of my bedroom, and I paced around until I was fully awake. I just felt like maybe she wasn’t on board with the project. (Laughs) But I just felt like she’s too important. That’s what I always came back to. She’s too important, and I’m afraid that people will lose sight of her.

One of the keys to understanding Adrienne Rich is to know how much she truly loved learning. I’ve never beheld someone dead or alive who loved to learn more than Adrienne Rich. That motivated everything she did. As she grew up, she had this powerful teacher and scourge in her life, and his name was Dr. Arnold Rich, her father. He loved learning as much as she did. She had a truly natural gift for writing, especially poetry. She also had in him someone who wanted her to be the very best poet on the planet. They worked in tandem to accomplish that goal as long as they were able to get along. When there was finally a rift between them when she was still a young woman, then she had to go it alone, essentially.

 # Prosecutors want 2017 arrest of teen in Floyd death trial
 Associated Press
 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Prosecutors in the upcoming trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd want to introduce evidence of a 2017 arrest in which they say the officer held his knee on the back of a 14-year-old boy and ignored his pleas that he couldn't breathe.
 Assistant Attorney General Matthew Frank, in a memorandum filed in Hennepin County District Court, said the body camera video that captured the boy's arrest shows that Derek Chauvin uses unreasonable force when dealing with a suspect who does not immediate comply with his orders, the Star Tribune reported.
 "As was true with the conduct with George Floyd, Chauvin rapidly escalated his use of force for a relatively minor offense," Frank wrote in the filing. "Just like with Floyd, Chauvin used an unreasonable amount of force without regard for the need for that level of force or the victim's well-being."
 Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, argued that the force used in the 2017 arrest was in keeping with department's then-policy on dealing with uncooperative suspects.
 Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died in May after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck for several minutes while Floyd said he couldn't breathe. His death sparked a renewed sense of outrage over the deaths of Black people at the hands of police and sparked mass demonstrations.
 In the 2017 arrest, the 14-year-old was slow to comply with Chauvin and another officer's instructions, so Chauvin grabbed the child by the throat, forced him to the ground and put his knee on the boy's neck before placing him in a prone position with a knee in his back, prosecutors said.
 The boy told Chauvin "he could not breathe. And just like with Floyd, Chauvin ignored those pleas and refused to provide medical assistance," Frank wrote.
 Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill has yet to rule on Monday's memorandum.
 Chauvin and his co-defendants, Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, were all fired the day after Floyd's death. Chauvin is facing second-degree unintentional murder and manslaughter charges, while the other three former officers are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and manslaughter.
 The four former officers are expected to stand trial in state court in March.

Prior to the pandemic, our students already were struggling to make ends meet. Fifty percent qualify for federal Pell grant funding. The average estimated family contribution (EFC) for our Fall enrollees is $670. The EFC represents the maximum amount of financial support a student’s household likely can devote to tuition, fees, and books in a year. There are few, if any, safety nets for our students. In fact, most walk a tightrope trying to balance school, family, transportation challenges, lack of childcare, and even homelessness. Unfortunately for many, life too often got in the way of their dreams. And then comes a pandemic — the epitome of adding insult to injury.
