That passion for keeping the animals fed and keeping enclosures clean extends to keeping the public connected, even when they can't be face to face with their favorite platypus.

Secretary of State for Transport Grant Shapps, said: “We are taking decisive action to protect the public which means reducing travel for the time being, whilst still ensuring keyworker heroes can get to their jobs to keep this nation running.
 “For passengers in crucial roles, including essential workers in our emergency services and NHS, alongside people who need to attend medical appointments or care for loved ones, these changes protect the services they rely on.
 “Our railways are at the heart of this country’s transport links, and we continue to work closely with the industry to develop measures that protects operators in these challenging times.”
 As GTR continues to deal with the impacts of coronavirus on its own workforce, it is possible that further changes to services may be required at short notice. Passengers should check for the latest updates on the National Rail Enquiries website before travelling.

The recent decline trend in mortgage rates has been driven by investors shifting money out of the stock market and into the safety of U.S. Treasurys as the crisis in confidence around the global viral outbreak has worsened. Long-term mortgage rates tend to track the yields on the 10-year Treasury note, so they typically fall in tandem.

The Vietnam connection
 Social media companies are still under fire for the way they handled the last election cycle. As the 2020 primary season rolls on in the states, Silicon Valley's giants face intense scrutiny to ensure their platforms aren't abused again for election interference. Ahead of the Iowa caucuses last month, YouTube spelled out new policies regarding deepfake videos and other forms of sophisticated disinformation. The video service said it would take down "technically manipulated or doctored" videos, as well as content that attempts to mislead people about voting or census issues, such as when and where to vote.

He lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but grew up in Virginia, where he lived for 11 years. Because of Fiverr's privacy policies, he doesn't know the names of the people behind the channel. All Sulejmanovic knew, he said, was that the client was listed as being in the US. He emphasized that he does lots of voice-over work for other YouTubers and audiobook authors, not just those right-wing channels.
 Sulejmanovic said he started doing the Breaking News videos last summer, though he couldn't remember exactly when. He didn't know how many videos he'd done, but said he got a new order after every 100 videos. He also wouldn't say how much money he made; his Fiverr account says his services start at $5, a common price on the platform. After he quit, the Breaking News channel found other voice-over actors to read its scripts.
 I asked Sulejmanovic why his handle is Dinaric Wolf. The first part is a tribute to the Dinaric Alps, the mountain range that stretches from Italy, through Bosnia and Herzegovina, and down to Albania. The wolf part, he said, is because, "When I work alone, I work best."
 Sulejmanovic thought of himself as a lone wolf, just a random freelancer to be found on Fiverr. It turned out he was part of something much bigger. The disinformation network he unknowingly helped bring to life spanned the world far beyond him, apparently from Vietnam to California.
 He may have not realized it, but he was never working alone. ●

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, "The idea of anybody getting it (a test) easily -- the way people in other countries are doing it -- we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes, but we're not."      Hopefully, the testing situation is changing now. And history will be asked to evaluate our country's response.      On a brighter note, our local government leaders, here in Omaha and Nebraska at least, seem to be stepping up to the challenge with speed and transparency.      Meanwhile, we're in the middle of the penitential season of Lent, and I think it's important to draw the two -- the pandemic, our faith -- together. We have, after all, a history of our own response to write.      This is one of those moments -- Pearl Harbor, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, 9/11 -- that people will be talking about for the rest of their lives. Will any of us ever forget where we were mid-March, and the events we saw unfold?      Maybe you're trying to work from home with your kids out of school. Maybe your job in the service industry is threatened. Maybe you're leaving a college campus midterm. Social lives imploding, trips canceled (I was supposed to leave for Greece on March 17), the economy threatened, sports and other activities impacted.      So we try to adapt Lent to this new reality. I pray to understand how I am being called to respond. I can feel OK about this hunkering down, until that moment of panic when I wonder just how long I will be asked to hunker.      The best advice I saw was on Twitter: Use this time to flex your contemplative muscles. Odd terms to use in relation to contemplation, perhaps, yet we need discipline and strength to turn our minds to God in these moments.      Contact friends daily. Laugh and cultivate that sense of humor. Touch base with those who live alone. Read. Ration news and social media. Keep a journal of these days for posterity. Take long walks. Make Lent sacrificial -- resist lapsing into bad habits under stress.      And pray for those who are suffering from this disease worldwide, across all borders. Pray for the first responders and medical personnel who are putting their lives on the line in this fight.      Like all our lives, this, too, will pass. So let's make this a Lent for the history books.      \- Effie Caldarola is a columnist with the Catholic News Service.
