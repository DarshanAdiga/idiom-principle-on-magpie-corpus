More often than not, choose clear and legible fonts in your designs. If you do choose to use a fancy font, save it for titles and headers, not substantial amounts of text. As a rule of thumb use legible fonts for tutorials, descriptions, and dialogue. These are areas that will frustrate the user if they cannot easily read or understand the text.

If I have waxed too much nostalgically, know that it was intentional. For what makes Hurwtiz’s film so moving is a thing that’s so badly needed today: a belief in a more egalitarian America, and a belief in the power of place. They have both been waning fast in the last few decades, and the pandemic is bringing them into hard relief. We are now forced to remember a time we could physically congregate. We are now also forced to confront public officials who blithely float the idea of sacrificing seniors for “the greater good.” Regarding that line of thinking, it’s more than just a slippery slope. It’s a highway to hell where the sign posts read, “who’s next?”

Boho Camper Vans was recently featured on "Shark Tank"'s March 20 episode as a "mobile real estate company." The company initially applied for the show as a "joke," founder and partner David Sodemann told Business Insider.

Boho Camper Vans is comprised of two main businesses. Along with converting vans into campers, Boho has a rental fleet of seven vans for weekend warriors looking to take a trip. And while there has been a decrease in rental demands amid the  coronavirus pandemic, the van converting component of the company is booked out until June, and this date will likely be pushed back even further with the influx in inquiries since its "Shark Tank" appearance.

That's right, unlimited! And the Feds balance sheet reflects that — it’s surging well over $5 trillion and headed to infinity. Over the past twelve years, policies such as “unlimited bailouts” from our omnipotent global central bankers have destroyed markets' natural ability to properly value and price every investment product. All these products, across the board, are mispriced. Interest rates are a function of credit risk or how likely a company is to default on its loan obligations. Today, many corporate bond yields are near zero, implying a zero percent chance of default when the chances are much higher.
