Fortunately for NASCAR, it’s a new era, with a new generation of young, socially conscious drivers. Rising star Kyle Larson lost his ride with Chip Ganassi Racing for blurting out the N-word when communicating with a crew member during a virtual race in April.
 That decision came after many of Larson’s sponsors withdrew their support, showing NASCAR understands the bottom line and can read the room in an era of rising support for removing statues of Confederate generals. Larson will get another ride, as he should. Just not this year.
 You can change the rules, but you can’t change people’s hearts. There will always be resistance to progress, and even if it didn’t manifest itself over the weekend, it’s not going away anytime soon. Wallace’s mother said in a satellite radio interview on Monday that “this is not his first incident,,,, If he gets into an incident with another driver, they’re quick to throw out the N-word. He’s been told he doesn’t belong.”
 If anyone’s intention had been to intimidate or silence Wallace, it backfired. His profile has only grown in the past month—not bad for a guy who’s never won a Cup race. Millions were pulling for him on Monday, when he reached the top five in the final laps before fuel issues doomed him to a 14th-place finish.
 Like all of us, NASCAR still has work to do. You’d hope that for every fan it loses, it gains two for being progressive.
 The NFL, the nation’s most profitable league, isn’t in immediate danger of losing its fan base. The consensus reaction to Goodell’s recent video message has been, better late than never.
 Thanks to baseball’s playground-style labor standoff, the NFL looks better by comparison. But this is a league that has mishandled and sometimes ignored key issues like domestic violence, concussions and, yes, racism.
 For once, the NFL could look to NASCAR for tips on crisis management—and on doing the right thing.

The Ultrastar DC SN840 uses the same 96L TLC and in-house SSD controller as the SN640, but the SN840 offers more features, performance and endurance to serve a higher market segment than the more mainstream SN640. The SN840 uses a 15mm thick U.2 form factor compared to 7mm U.2 (and M.2 and EDSFF options) for the SN640, which allows the SN840 to handle much higher power levels and to accommodate higher drive capacities in the U.2 form factor. The controller is still a PCIe 3 design so peak sequential read performance is barely faster than the SN640, but the rest of the performance metrics are much faster than the SN640: random reads now saturate the PCIe 3 x4 link and write performance is much higher across the board. Power consumption can reach 25W, but the SN840 provides a range of configurable power states to limit it to as little as 11W.

Sunny borders with bold, bright blooms catch the attention of everyone but if you have a garden with shade, do not worry; these areas can be lovely, too. There are perennials that boast exotic flowers and others with pretty leaf color. A shade garden can be cool and inviting and is a pleasant place to garden on hot summer days. The good news is that there are plenty of plants that can tolerate or even prefer a shaded position.      Some of my favorite perennials for the shaded area have beautiful flowers and others I grow for the stunning foliage. Both have great qualities and when choosing plants for this situation, you need to think about different textures and foliage color. You do not want to choose plants that all have dark green foliage. Add a splash of cream, golden or white foliage to make the garden come alive.      If you want something new, Wild Swan, a Japanese anemone, produces masses of white flowers with attractive lavender-blue bands on the reverse of the petals. One outstanding feature is it flowers over a long time, blooming continuously from early to late summer. It typically grows 16 to 24 inches and makes a clump almost as wide. The flowers are gracefully carried on wiry stems above the deeply divided, dark green foliage. I have grown several other Japanese anemones such as Honorine Jobert and Whirlwind for years but they do not bloom until fall. Wild Swan blooms in the summer and over a longer period of time.      Hardy begonia is a must for a long period of either white or pink blooms. The flowers stand up above the interesting foliage and add lovely color. I have some growing in damp places as well as drier areas. If it is happy, it will seed about and give you a real show. It comes up later than other plants so do not disturb the ground in early spring or you will lose these lovely, charming plants.      If you live in zone 7 or cooler, hardy geranium Rozanne is a top choice for color. I have it planted along a border and it blooms all summer sporting lovely violet-blue flowers. Do not get this confused with a plant that is also named geranium that is an annual. The annual geranium is quite different from the hardy geranium Rozanne.      Hostas are at the top of the list of most shade gardeners. The array of textures, shapes and sizes of hostas are amazing. You can find some hostas that are quite large and others that are tiny. Two large ones that come to mind are Empress Wu and Sun and Substance. A true focal point for any shade garden, these giant forms are very impressive. Empress Wu can grow 4 feet tall and 7 or 8 feet wide with leaves well over 15 inches wide. Some of the small hosta plants do not get over 5 inches tall with leaves an inch wide. They do flower and can be dramatic while others are quite fragrant.      Brunnera Jack Frost is a real winner in my book. It has lovely clouds of tiny, pale blue, airy flowers in the spring, resembling forget-me-nots. I grow this for the handsome foliage that lights up a shady spot in my garden. The heart- shaped silver leaves are edged and veined with green that remain attractive throughout the growing season. They form a dense and lush mound, which deer and rabbits resist.      One last flower that I want to mention is not too showy but is exotic, toad lily. It has small, intricate flowers that are born on upright, arching stems. Foliage varies with the cultivar, as do the flowers. The blooms remind me of a small orchid and the foliage is really interesting and often two tones of green.      When I hear people talking about ornamental grasses, I never got excited until I started growing Japanese forest grass All Gold. It forms a mound of small, arching gold leaves that grow to about 18 inches, a perfect size to go under a maple tree or to line a bed. Since its color is from the foliage, it goes well with darker foliage plants, looking pretty all season and brightening up the garden.      You cannot beat ferns for a lovely airy look for the shade garden. They lend a natural appeal to a shade spot and are very disease and pest resistant and require little care. Ferns are great companions for other perennials and they come in all sizes. My favorite is the maidenhair ferns, but I would not want to be without some of the autumn ferns either. Cinnamon ferns with a rusty brown hue, add a different dimension, especially as they come out of the ground in the spring.      Two other foliage plants to consider are Solomon's seal, with its graceful, arching stems and some of the gingers. Callaway ginger with its round evergreen leaves has a prominent silver-white mottling. It forms a large clump over time and you do not have to worry about deer dining on this plant.      One of the first things to know when planning a shade garden is to understand what kind of shade you have. Light shade or dappled shade means you have some sun but it is filtered or only sunny a few hours of the day. Deep shade is when you have large trees that block out direct sunlight. Plus, the soil can be damp and take certain plants or dry shade, requiring a different group of plants. These conditions will determine which plants are best for you to grow.

Dorchester School District Two teams have certainly put their stamp on South Carolina Wrestling.
 Rock Hill owns bragging rights when it comes to the most state wrestling championships earned in the state, but Dorchester teams have gone on some serious rolls over the years. Beginning in 1986, Summerville advanced to the Class AAAA Wrestling Championship match 11 straight years and won four of them while losing the others to Rock Hill. Steve LaPrad was the team’s head coach through that run and left Summerville having led the Green Wave to a total of five state titles.
 Mike Frye took over the Summerville program and led the team to the 4A State Championship match the next two years, but again Rock Hill claimed the titles.
 In 1998, Kenny Walker led Summerville back to the wrestling finals and to another state championship. Rock Hill would claim the prize the next two seasons, but starting in 2001 a Dorchester County team captured the title for eight of the next 10 years.
 Summerville won the 4A Championship in 01, 02, 04, 05, 06 and 08. In 2003, B.D. LaPrad, brother of Steve LaPrad, led Dutch Fork to the title. He was later hired by his brother to coach the Fort Dorchester Wrestling team and led the Patriots to the 4A Championship in 2007 and 2010.
 The only other time during the run that the title was claimed by a non- Dorchester team was in 2009 when Rock Hill defeated Fort Dorchester in the finals.
 The 2011 season marked the first time in seven years that a team other than Summerville or Fort Dorchester represented the Lower State in the 4A Championship match. No local teams have claimed a state wrestling championship since. However, several have claimed a Lower State title.
 In 2014 Darryl Tucker led Summerville to the championship bought, but lost to Rock Hill. In 2015 Derel Brown led Fort Dorchester to the title match, but lost to Rock Hill. In 2016 Stacey Woods led Ashley Ridge into the finals for the first time, but lost to Dorman.
 The 2016-17 school year was the first for which South Carolina had a Class AAAAA.
 The only local team to ever participate in a 5A Wrestling State Championship match is the Patriots. In 2018, Andrew Young led Fort Dorchester into the finals, but lost to Rock Hill.

After the 15 minutes of cooking, you have to use a bit of judgement so you can determine if the jam is reaching the “jelling point,” which is the point where jam turns from fruit in sugar to a substance that will thicken when cooled and stay thickened. For this particular apricot jam, I’ve found the jelling point to be about 218 degrees (at sea level). So once the surface begins to look very “glisteny,” and the bubbles seem larger, thicker, and shiny, stick your candy thermometer into the mixture and start monitoring the temperature. You’re looking at another 2 to 7 minutes of cooking, depending on how juicy a mixture you started with, and how rich in natural pectin the fruit is.

 Compare that to the four years NFL commissioner Roger Goodell waited to utter the words “Black Lives Matter” after Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 to protest police treatment of minorities. The league’s players are predominantly black, but it took a video featuring many of the league’s top African-American stars to induce Goodell to do the right thing.
 Hats (or helmets) off to NASCAR, which hasn’t always been known as a particularly progressive organization. Its roots are in the South, and part of its mythology is that early racers were moonshine runners.
 NASCAR’s ratings and attendance have slipped since its heyday in the 1990s, when it expanded outside the Sun Belt in search of a more diverse (and, some argued, affluent) audience. That ambition ruffled many of its “traditional” Southern fans, who felt they were losing their hold on the sport.
 So although banning the Confederate flag was absolutely the right thing to do, it didn’t come without risk to the France family. The coronavirus means empty (or nearly empty) grandstands at most races and a huge drop in revenue. Will some lifelong fans tune out for good?
