 England will start a packed schedule with the non-cap international clash against the Barbarians, before completing the delayed Six Nations and moving onto the new Autumn Nations Cup.
 Jones would typically be without his frontline stars for the Barbarians game, given the standard clash with the Premiership final.
 And the no-nonsense Australian admitted battling where possible to conduct business as usual, at least in coaching terms.
 “Traditionally this camp’s always been about giving opportunities to young players and having chances to see new people,” said Jones.
 “You get teams that aren’t in the Premiership semi-finals, so you get a smattering of young guys.

From its location in Shawnee, OK, KSNL Aero currently conducts business in Israel, Greece, Thailand, Indonesia, Barbados, St Maarten, and the United States. Mr. Darrin Lofton the owner of KSNL Aero also owns an airline in the country of Indonesia that operates flights daily in Papua, where he hires many Indonesian Papuan Citizens. Mr. Lofton would like to open the event by speaking about the importance of the President Trump Tax Breaks and how this enables his business to provide Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance free to his employees in America. According to Mr. Lofton “America doesn’t need Obama Care, America needs jobs. Obama care is an unnecessary drain on our economy which has caused Insurance prices to increase at least 50% over the past decade.” Mr. Lofton believes that cancelling Obama Care in its entirety and creating an “Open Market” of Insurance Providers is the only viable plan for United States small businesses which are a huge driver of the economy. In addition to providing jobs in the United States, Mr. Lofton provides employment opportunities to the indigenous peoples of Papua. According to Mr. Lofton the Papuan people whom he employs in Indonesia are a 93% Christian People living in a 97% Muslim Nation. They are tremendous supporters of the United States and huge fans of President Donald Trump, but most people of the United States are not aware that the Papuans exist. “Each time I travel to Papua, I am amazed at the shirts I see people wearing. I Love America, American Flags, and Donald Trump. I am always asked about President Trump by the local Papuan Government officials.” Mr. Lofton has partnered in business with a Native Papuan who works on President Jokowi’s staff in the Presidential Palace, and Mr. Lofton has offices in Jakarta, and Papua.

 Maybe we shouldn’t be surprised – but seeing clubs put their own financial wellbeing above public health considerations and their community’s safety and wellbeing has been particularly disappointing.
 That other escapades, whether it’s The Nutcracker, cinemas or late-night drinking, have received lighter treatment is not a defence. That is just a sign of poor policy-making by the government, and two wrongs do not make a right.
 What is football without the right to dance in an away end, sing rude songs about the referee or your rivals, or hugging that total stranger after a glorious last-minute winner? Not much I would suggest.
 The real mistake here has been football’s over-eagerness to restart in the first place. They risked further financial ruin on the assumption that they could get bums on seats by the start of October. That was a mistake.
 The EFL promised clubs that a financial bailout package was coming; either from the Premier League or the government. Neither has arrived, and more clubs than ever before are closer to the financial precipice. The EFL lead clubs down the garden’s path, and many could yet pay the price for that recklessness and naivety.

The most immediate question is what will be its impact on fuel use. Six years of digitalisation have been compressed into six months. For years, there has been talk about the “office of the future”. But now we know: for many, the office of the future will be at home, for at least two or three days a week. The result will be less fuel use. But, at least in the short-term, that will be counterbalanced by people preferring their private car to public transport. A longer-term question is the impact on companies of having people working remotely in terms of cohesion and culture, as well as the creativity that comes from people interacting and meeting up in the canteen.

New Delhi [India], October 8 (ANI/PRNewswire): Self Storage India, India's first self-storage company, is growing its presence around Delhi NCR with the expansion of its Gurugram warehouse. The expanded Gurugram facility has 50 per cent more capacity to cater to India's growing self-storage needs.   As a one-stop solution for anyone moving homes, requiring a home-office, or needing extra storage space for their business, Self Storage India aims to streamline the storage experience. The professional team members ensure a stress-free experience by guiding customers through the simplified process.   Located in the heart of Gurugram, at Udyog Vihar, the warehouse is convenient for those around Delhi NCR, Gurugram, Faridabad, and even Manesar. It is also in proximity to the Delhi border and NH8, making it easy for people to access the facility. Locations such as Red Fort, India Gate, Indira Gandhi International Airport, Qutub Minar, and Lotus temple are just a short distance away from the Gurugram warehouse.   "We are delighted to announce that our Gurugram warehouse will be able to serve more customers now. During the COVID-19 lockdown, we witnessed a surge in demand for our self-storage facilities. Self Storage India also saw a rising need for self-storage services from people who have been working from home during the COVID-19 lockdown. Considering their request, we expanded the Gurugram facility by adding units of varying sizes, ranging from 50-150 sq. ft. We are excited to open our doors to more customers who need self-storage facilities in and around Delhi NCR," said Manjali Khosla, Co-Founder and CEO, Self Storage India, on the expansion of the Gurugram facility.  
 All Self Storage India warehouses offer 24/7 surveillance, guards patrolling around the clock, regular cleaning of the areas following COVID-19 measures, easy move-in, personalized visits, well-lit areas, pest control, helpful staff, easily accessible locations, and more.   Understanding the customers' needs, Self Storage India had accommodated some policy changes when the country went into lockdown in March 2020. The customers were not charged any late fees, nor any revisions were made to their pre-lockdown rates. The company swiftly went into action to ensure all hygiene measures were in place to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   "We understood that our customers were going through challenging times, and as a conscientious company, we took a call to support our customers and make things easier. With life slowly getting back on track, we went ahead with expanding the Gurugram facility to fulfill customers' burgeoning needs," added Manjali Khosla.   Self Storage India's sprawling Gurugram facility in Sector 18 is the flagship storage facility with another gigantic warehouse located in Noida, Sector 59. The company aims to add more locations soon. Customers looking for impeccable self-storage services can head to the refreshed Gurugram center and rent a dedicated storage unit to keep all their valuables safe and secure.

Gov. JB Pritzker said Wednesday that agencies under his control are looking at grant programs and personnel costs to reduce expenses but did not offer additional details of cuts that could be in the works.
   
 At the same time, Pritzker struck an optimistic tone that Congress will still eventually approve additional aid to states and cities to offset the loss of revenue from the coronavirus pandemic.
   
 During a virtual news conference, Pritzker addressed questions about the kinds of reductions state agency directors are suggesting following his directive that they identify cuts of up to 5% this year. The governor also has asked directors to identify 10% reductions that can be proposed for next year's budget.
   
 "The challenge when you have such a large number to consider is how to do the least amount of damage," Pritzker said.
   
 He said the same people opposed to the graduated income tax that he wants to bring to Illinois are also opposed to any more federal aid to states and consequently are forcing "deep and lasting, tremendously damaging cuts if we had to make all of those cuts." He said the funding shortfall could force cuts to public safety programs and schools.
   
 "I don't know anybody who thinks that's a good idea," he said.
   
 Pritzker acknowledged what will be tough are cuts to personnel costs in the state. Illinois already has the lowest per capita state workforce in the country.
   
 "As we're trying to build back a government that actually services people, it's very difficult to consider who to lay off," he said.
   
 Pritzker did not say when he might start to impose the cuts directors identify.
   
 Although talks in Washington on a new COVID relief package were broken off by President Donald Trump, Pritzker said he remains optimistic something will be done, primarily because some states led by Republican governors have financial problems as great as or greater than those states with Democratic governors. Pritzker said he thinks no matter who is elected president, one of the first things they'll have to do is act on a relief package.
   
 Pritzker also gave an update on COVID-19 cases in the state during the news conference. The governor is currently quarantined because a member of his staff tested positive for the virus. He said he's been tested twice in the last 10 days and the results have been negative.
   
 The Illinois Department of Public Health reported 2,630 new cases of COVID-19 Wednesday, bringing the statewide total to 307,641. There were another 42 deaths bringing that total to 8,878.
   
 A week after saying there were promising declines in nearly every region of the state, Pritzker said things have "cooled off a bit." Positivity rates across the state have leveled off, he said, and three regions that had been showing declining positivity rates were now leveled off. Region 9 at the northern border of the state and Region 5 covering far southern Illinois have gone from decreasing positivity to increasing.
   
 The only region in the state to flip from an increasing rate to a "relatively stable" rate is Region 3, which includes Sangamon County, Pritzker said.
   
 Region 1, which includes Rockford, Winnebago County and other north and northwestern counties, had mitigation efforts imposed because of rising numbers of cases. That region remains under those restrictions.
   
 Pritzker said the Metro East area that has been under restrictions since August has shown significant improvement and could see the restrictions lifted by the end of the week.
   
 Pritzker lauded the level of testing going on in Illinois. The state passed the 6 million mark for tests administered on Wednesday. Illinois is averaging about 60,000 tests a day.
   
 "There is testing available to you if you need it," Pritzker said.

Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration is exploring restrictions on billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Group as well as Tencent Holdings Ltd. over concerns that their digital payment platforms threaten U.S. national security, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that risks infuriating China and disrupting what could be the world’s largest initial public offering.
 Debate over how and whether to restrict Ant Group’s and Tencent’s payment systems has accelerated among senior U.S. officials in recent weeks though a final decision isn’t imminent, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity about an idea that’s still taking shape.
 U.S. officials are concerned that Ant Group and other Chinese fintech platforms will come to dominate global digital payments, the people said. That in turn could give China access to banking and personal data of hundreds of millions of people. Senior administration officials discussed the idea in a Sept. 30 meeting in the White House Situation Room, according to two people familiar with the matter.
 Yet officials acknowledge that it would be difficult to move forward until they sort out the mechanism, and that is proving difficult to do as the officials seek to find a legally sound approach.
 There’s no indication the idea has been presented to President Donald Trump, whose approval would be required to proceed, two of the people said. The president fell ill with coronavirus a day after officials met to discuss China, and the issue hasn’t made much progress at such a senior level in the days since, one of the people said.
 The internal discussions come as Ant, the online finance giant and owner of the Alipay e-payment system, nears a dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, possibly by the end of the month. An affiliate of Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Ant is preparing for an IPO of about $35 billion that would give it an overall valuation of $250 billion, twice that of Citigroup Inc.
 Ant Group said in a statement that it unaware of any administration discussions and that its “business is primarily in China and we are excited about our growth prospects in the China market.”
 Tencent didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Communications staff for the White House, Treasury Department and State Department declined to comment. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office and Commerce Department also didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.
 Imposing restrictions on Ant Group -- a crown jewel of the world’s second- largest economy -- would mark a major escalation in the Trump administration’s economic and political confrontation with Beijing. Since Trump took office, the U.S. has taken aim at Chinese success stories including ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok video app and Huawei Technologies Co.
 The U.S. discussions are sure to cast a shadow over the Ant Group share sale, where many investors are lining up to invest billions of dollars. Restrictions would also impact U.S. investors who have already sunk millions of dollars into Ant. In 2018, Silver Lake Management LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC, and Carlyle Group Inc. invested at least $500 million each in the financial technology giant, people familiar with the matter said at the time.
 There’s an incentive to act now, with the U.S. election approaching: embed as many restrictions against China as possible in the hopes that some of them will stick if Democratic nominee Joe Biden carries his current lead in national polls into a victory next month over Trump.
 Discussions around Ant Group’s and Tencent’s payment platforms have been held up in part by debate over what authority the government would use to restrict the companies, and how quickly any measures could be implemented. It’s deemed unlikely by U.S. officials that measures could be ready before the Nov. 3 election, and there are concerns that the actions could be swatted down in court.
 One option would be to use authorities granted under a 2019 order to protect the digital supply chain, though that would likely add weeks to the administration’s timeline. A speedier alternative would be to draft a new executive order along the lines of the presidential directives banning ByteDance’s TikTok and Tencent’s WeChat messaging app.
 That course has its risks. Courts have recently granted injunctions halting the administration’s bids to ban TikTok and WeChat, saying the White House may have exceeded its authority and granting a temporary reprieve to the apps from being removed from U.S. digital stores.
 Yet one official said the administration thinks it would have an easier time in the courts if it went that route because, while the TikTok and Wechat bans were challenged on free-speech grounds, there would be no such concern with Alipay and the Tencent payment services.
 Another potentially more damaging possibility is putting Ant Group and Tencent on the Treasury Department’s specially designated national list, a move that would make them all but radioactive for any U.S. company -- and possibly overseas firms -- to do business with them.
 Any significant move against Ant Group risks provoking Beijing far more than previous U.S. measures, even those aimed at TikTok. It would likely fuel suspicions that the U.S. is not interested in data security but instead wants to hold back innovative Chinese companies that have far surpassed anything Silicon Valley has to offer.
 Alipay is woven into the fabric of Chinese society, providing services from wealth management and insurance to credit checks and consumer loans. If U.S. buyers purchase items from its affiliate Alibaba, their identity and private data could be collected.
 That said Ant retreated from expansions in the U.S., in tandem with Alibaba, after U.S.-China tensions escalated. Ant’s business remains mostly in China today.
 The sanctions idea originated with administration officials who favor a hard line toward Beijing -- especially in Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s State Department. They argue that China’s ruling Communist Party wants access to user data from around the world through companies that have grown increasingly powerful on the global stage.
 Those concerns echo administration arguments that telecommunications equipment maker Huawei’s rush into 5G mobile networks creates a worldwide security risk. U.S. officials say that firms such as Ant, Tencent and Huawei are complicit in what U.S. officials have previously characterized as the technological repression of the Chinese people, claims those companies and China’s government have rejected.
 The idea of restricting Ant has been championed from the State Department, where advisers are pressing a “Clean Network” initiative. In August, as part of that effort, Pompeo unveiled new guidance warning against using Chinese 5G equipment, undersea cables and cloud-computing software.
 The public element of that initiative didn’t focus on digital payments but officials have privately discussed the idea of a “clean currency” system that would purge Chinese firms from online payments. The administration has also been emboldened by its anti-Huawei campaign, which it credits with pressuring many European countries to effectively ban the company’s equipment from their 5G networks.
 “Freedom-loving nations must come together to confront the CCP’s aggressive behavior,” Pompeo told reporters in August about the Clean Network plan. “And the good news is the tide is absolutely turning.”

A TEMPER tantrum at the laundromat was fuelled by a combination of stress and a run-in with a laundromat employee, a court has heard.
 Police were called when Dylan Robert Reid, 24, flew into a rage at a Laidley laundromat on December 28 last year, but it was his driving history they were more interested in.
 Reid, 24, a labourer from Kensington Grove, pleaded guilty to causing public nuisance; and driving while disqualified by court order on two separate occasions.
 Prosecutor Sergeant Rose Molinaro said Reid had a prior conviction for driving when disqualified at Gatton in January last year, and was on a suspended jail sentence and a two-year probation order for unrelated matters.
 He had also been convicted of throwing a frying pan at another person.
 Defence lawyer Amy Zanders said Reid, born and raised in Maryborough, has an intellectual impairment, anger issues, hyperactivity, with some drug and alcohol use issues.
 Ms Zanders said the laundromat incident happened when his partner dropped off clothes, then had car trouble and was not able to return until much later.
 “They were both distressed and a laundromat worker confronted then about leaving the washing and he snapped,” she said.
 “It is no excuse for his behaviour.”
 Reid was later charged with driving while disqualified over his trip to the laundromat.
 When charged with driving disqualified on May 31 this year, Ms Zanders said Reid was testing new brake pads.
 The court heard Reid was disqualified from driving for two years by a Gatton court in January this year.
 He committed the same offence in March 2018 and was disqualified for two years.
 Magistrate Terry Duroux told Reid his traffic history was “disgraceful” for someone his age.
 Mr Duroux said it would seem emotions ran high at the laundromat, and he fined Reid $400 for that public nuisance offence.
 For the two driving disqualified charges, Reid was sentenced to a total of four months jail, and was disqualified for three years on each offence.
 Reid was allowed immediate parole.

“That’s why this match is very important for me. I played a few five-setters here and I never won. I think at the end this night I deserved to win.”
 After two gruelling sets were shared the third, which featured eight breaks of serve, felt pivotal.
 Schwartzman squandered a set point on the Thiem serve with a forehand which floated long, was promptly broken in the next, but then hit back to take it to a tie-break.
 An outrageous drop shot from the baseline which flopped almost apologetically over the net brought up two set points for Thiem.
 Battling Schwartzman saved both, but Thiem dispatched a third with an overhead to take the lead for the first time in the match.
 Yet Schwartzman forged ahead in the fourth and had three set points on his own serve, only for Thiem to save the lot – including one with a scarcely believable forehand pass on the run – to take it to 5-5.
 However, Schwartzman took the subsequent tie-break and, amidst a superhuman effort from both players, the 28-year-old from Buenos Aires had more left in the tank in the decider.
