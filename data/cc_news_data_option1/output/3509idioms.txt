 Signatories to the letter also include Logistics UK, UK Warehousing Association, the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, Cold Chain Federation, British Association of Removers, British International Freight Association and British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association (BVRLA).
 RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said: “There are a range of critical issues the chancellor, Michael Gove and the transport secretary need to address ranging from the SmartFreight app and other untried and untested IT systems, to the lack of customs agents and clear processes for tackling the mountain of red tape traders will face.
 “The government’s pace is simply too slow on this, and that’s why we – the people who run the UK’s supply chain – need an urgent meeting with those at the top of government dealing with Brexit preparations.”
 A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said it had “worked closely with industry” and would “continue to do so as we move towards the end of the transition period”.

 This is a fun dish for all the pepper lovers out there. I used a variety of peppers from the garden: jalapeños, bell peppers, Anaheims and poblanos. You can use a mixture as I did, or choose your favorite. The addition of the eggs will give an almost soufflelike texture to the casserole.
 You'll need 8 to 10 peppers, and based on the size of the peppers, you may want to use a few more or less. The number of peppers to be layered into the casserole is flexible.
 CHORIZO AND ROASTED PEPPER CASSEROLE
 • 8 to 10 peppers (your choice of heat levels)
 • 1 pound Mexican chorizo, casings removed
 • 1 large yellow onion, diced
 • 4 cloves garlic, minced
 • 2 cans Rotel tomatoes
 • 1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano
 • 3 cups shredded Monterey Jack, Mexican blend or Cotija cheese
 • 12 eggs
 • 1/3 cup self-rising flour
 • Pinch of salt
 • Chopped cilantro
 • Sour cream
 First, the peppers will need to be roasted, not only to remove the outer skin, but to also impart a charred flavor to them. Preheat the grill to 400 to 450 degrees F., and carefully place the peppers on the grill. Cover and let roast for a few minutes, turning them frequently with tongs as they begin to char. When the peppers have softened and charred, use tongs to remove them to a plastic bag and seal it tightly, or place the peppers in a bowl and cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. This will allow the peppers to \"sweat,\" and you can easily remove the charred outer layer. When the peppers have cooled enough to handle, discard the charred pieces and carefully cut the peppers so they will lay flat. Remove the stems, inner membrane and seeds, and discard.
 Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
 While the peppers are resting, place chorizo in a large skillet over medium heat. Break the chorizo into pieces with a wooden spoon and, frequently stirring, allow to cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add onions and garlic and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Drain well. Add Rotel tomatoes and oregano and reduce heat to low. Stirring occasionally, let the mixture cook for another 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat.
 Spray a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with non-stick spray.
 Add one-half of the chorizo mixture to the baking dish. Top with 1 cup of the cheese. Using about half of the peppers, add a layer of the peppers on top of the chorizo mixture.
 Repeat the layers using the remainder of the chorizo, 1 cup of cheese and the remaining peppers. In a large bowl, whisk eggs, flour and a pinch of salt together.
 Slowly pour the egg mixture over the top of the peppers and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the top starts to brown and the eggs are set, but still soft.
 Let rest for 2 to 3 minutes, cut into squares and serve. Top with chopped cilantro and sour cream.

Although stocks have reversed course in the opening hour of European cash trading, major currencies continue to sit tight in a pre-NFP lull for the most part so far today.
   
 EUR/USD is looking tepid, ranging between 1.1834 and 1.1858 as traders appear disinterested to make a move until after we get past the US jobs report later.
   
 For now, sellers still hold near-term control as price action rests below both the key hourly moving averages. The 200-hour MA (blue line) @ 1.1866 will offer the first line of defense for sellers before the 100-hour MA (red line) @ 1.1891 comes into play.
   
 Those will be the near-term upside levels to watch in case the dollar turns tail ahead of the long weekend in the US later in the day.
   
 As for downside levels, the recent trendline support that has been keeping the pair afloat was briefly broken in the intraday chart (as seen above) yesterday but is still somewhat intact I would argue, so that alongside 1.1800-10 will be the key near-term support levels to eye if the dollar pushes higher towards the end of the week.
   
 Further support is then seen closer to 1.1780 before we revisit the recent daily lows around 1.1754-63. Beyond that, the 1.1700-10 region remains a key line in the sand in terms of limiting downside moves since August trading.
   
 Looking ahead to the US jobs report later, I'm not too sure how much of a game changer it will be. The Fed has put more emphasis on labour market conditions for their new strategy, but what is on offer in the month of August shouldn't be anything new.
   
 There may be spots where the recovery in the labour market is weakening, and there are downside risks to the numbers to consider. The devil will be in the details.
   
 That said, I would argue that the market will react more to the numbers - if there even is a significant reaction - rather than the details.
   
 And in any case, the stock market reaction may perhaps end up being the key driver in US trading later so be mindful of that when viewing the dollar and risk trades as well.

“It’s nice having guys who can play multiple positions, especially shortstop, like Jake can do,” Preller said. “The thing our scouts had talked about was a guy that’s unflappable and a guy that they felt like he is a very intelligent baseball player and a guy that’s under control. We’ve seen all those things so far here in a short period of time. He’s come as advertised. He’s obviously played very well right from the start.”
 Cronenworth began exhibiting his versatility in college, including pitching. He said the Padres agreed he wouldn’t pitch this year due to the pandemic- shortened season.
 “I enjoy pitching. I think when I first initially did it, it came up as an idea and I thought it was a good opportunity to start doing something different,” Cronenworth said. “Playing shortstop and pitching, not too many guys are doing that and I thought it was a good way to separate myself and create some opportunity.”
 With the 21-year-old Tatis expected to be the everyday shortstop for years to come, Cronenworth will be content to play wherever Tingler pencils him in on the lineup sheet. Cronenworth has played short twice when Tatis was the DH.
 “Wherever they see me fit, whether it’s bouncing all over the place like I am or staying at second, I’m completely comfortable doing that,” he said.
 Cronenworth said he began working at first base during spring training, “obviously having no foresight that was going to be the first position I would ever see in the big leagues. I settled in there for the first couple of weeks and after Hos came back, I’ve been moving around ever since then.”

These regional “headquarters” began their own investigations of graft by local officials and recruited activists, some of whom would later run for office. Navalny believes that ending the dominance of United Russia in regional parliaments and administrations will undermine “the formal mechanism” of Putin’s rule.
 After Navalny was hospitalized in Germany, his team used the moment to promote Smart Voting, filling social media with calls to register on the project’s online platform that tells voters which candidates to support in their area. Volkov said the appeals have increased registrations.
 On Monday, they released a 40-minute expose of corruption in Novosibirsk, a large city in Siberia where a coalition of over 30 opposition candidates is running for the city council. The video, which has gotten over 4 million views on YouTube, was shot during Navalny’s fateful trip to Siberia.
 “The foundation of Putin’s power is not the State Duma, as one would think. No," Navalny says in the video, stressing the importance of the local elections.
 “Their main power is in United Russia having a majority in every regional legislature and a majority in every big city council. If (United Russia) loses this majority, the power of the villains melts away immediately,” he says.
 From these regional roots, Navalny’s team hopes to go all the way to the State Duma -- Russia’s lower house of parliament -- and deploy the Smart Voting strategy in the 2021 parliamentary election.

Playing in the same outfield as Tatis, Machado and Hosmer has been “unbelievable,” Cronenworth said.
 “Every single night it seems like one of those guys is doing something special, whether it’s on the defensive side of the ball or on the offensive side. It’s almost like I’m watching a highlight video every night. It’s pretty fun.
 “I’m just along for ride with those guys. They’re the stars of the show. I’m just a little kid from St. Clair, Michigan.”
 He’s hitting .346 with four homers and 17 RBIs, and has reached base 19 straight games. His on-base percentage is .405 and he’s slugging .606.
 General manager A.J. Preller, who pulled off a dizzying six trades from Saturday through the trade deadline on Monday, said Cronenworth was anything but a throw-in in the Pham trade.
 Preller said the Padres had Cronenworth targeted going back to last year, when pro scouts Dom Viola and Keith Boeck, plus analyst Dave Cameron, “felt he was a guy that could be something as an everyday player for us down the road. It’s nice to get multiple looks and options. They weighed in and had him targeted, and it was something we were able to line up on.
