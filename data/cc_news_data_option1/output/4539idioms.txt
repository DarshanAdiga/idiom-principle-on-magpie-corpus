According to SATBA, the number of small-scale solar power plants across the country which are used by households or small industries is also increasing noticeably as Iranian households and small industries are embracing the new technology with open arms and investors also seem eager for more contribution in this area.

Supporting new digital technologies depends heavily on reliable connectivity, so policymakers were in agreement that focusing on improving current networks is an urgent priority. In fact, 83% of the speakers and attendees said in one polling question during the summit that governments should make connectivity a priority in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We don’t yet know who won the 2020 election, but we do know who lost: the media. Almost every major media survey forecast an overwhelming popular-vote and electoral college win for Joe Biden and a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate. But the predicted blue wave seems not to have materialized.
 In Florida, polls gave Biden on average a lead of one point; the New York Times poll showed Biden beating President Donald Trump by three points, and Reuters showed him winning by four points. Instead, Trump won the state by more than three. In Pennsylvania, Biden led by more than a point on average in pre-election polls; the NBC News/Marist survey predicted a five-point Biden victory; instead, the race is down to the wire. In Wisconsin, pre-election polls showed the former vice president up almost seven points. The Washington Post/ABC News poll projected a 17-point Biden thrashing, while the Times predicted an 11-point Biden victory. Trump appears to have lost by just 21,000 votes.
 The same is true of the Senate. In Maine, not a single poll showed Sen. Susan Collins, R, winning reelection, and some showed her losing by six, seven and even 12 points. Instead, she crushed her opponent by more than seven points. In North Carolina, with the exception of the GOP Trafalgar Group, not a single poll in the past month showed Sen. Thom Tillis, R, winning his race; he leads by nearly two points. In Iowa, Sen. Joni Ernst, R, was supposed to be endangered, but won by nearly seven points. In Montana, Sen. Steve Daines, R, was supposed to be in a nail-biter, but won by 10. Far from taking back the Senate, as of this writing Democrats have gained a grand total of one net seat. And defying expectations, Republicans won almost every toss-up in the House — picking up at least six seats and leaving Democrats with the slimmest House majority in 20 years.

However, I wouldn't say withdrawal necessarily indicates shifting U.S. arms control strategy in the long run. Instead, it highlights stark differences between Trump and his election opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump also left the Open Skies Treaty and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)—known as the Iran Nuclear Deal—and removed U.S. signature from the Arms Trade Treaty. If re-elected, it's likely Trump will allow the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) with Russia to expire. It's the last remaining agreement limiting the world's two largest nuclear arsenals. But in my view, Trump isn't necessarily opposed to arms control, so much as he mistakenly believes only deals he makes are worthwhile. His diplomacy with North Korea that has achieved no progress toward denuclearization is one striking example.

Tricia Tyson, Kinsale RNLI lifeboat press officer said: 'This is not the first time Rory has raised funds for us. Last year he took part in the Celtic Steamers run from Baltimore to Kinsale, a spectacular cavalcade of vintage engines that raised over €5,000 for the RNLI, the charity that saves lives at sea. We also appreciate all the hard work of Billy and Frank who helped him both days, and the generosity of the public who filled the buckets.  The RNLI relies on the support of the public, and that is one thing that is never lacking in Kinsale.'

Two bungling thieves who used power tools to break into a Preston supermarket before trying to pull a cash machine away using a car have been jailed for a total of eight years.
 Nathan Green and Joseph Pike were part of a three-man gang who targeted the Co-op store on Granton Walk, Ingol.
 Police were called to the scene at around 10.30pm on July 11 and found that power tools had been used to gain access to the shop.
 A Kia Sportage was then attached to the cash machine and attempts had been made to pull it from the premises.
 However the offenders left empty handed after the Kia’s bumper came off.
 The vehicle was found abandoned nearby but officers were able to identify a second vehicle – a BMW – also being used by the group.
 A short time later it was located and pursued before eventually brought to a stop near Oldham.
 Both the Kia and the BMW had been reported stolen prior to the incident.
 Green, 37, of Sale Road, Manchester and Pike, 30, of Tabley Street, Ashton- under-Lyne, both pleaded guilty to burglary at Preston Crown Court.
 Green was sentenced to 45 months in prison with a further 15 months to run consecutively for dangerous driving.
 Pike was sentenced to 36 months behind bars for burglary.
 A third man - Anthony Lees, 35, of no fixed address – was charged with burglary and taking a vehicle without the owner’s consent but failed to appear at court.
 A bench warrant has since been issued for his arrest.

MESTRE (ITALPRESS) - A causa del Covid, quest'anno ogni italiano perderà mediamente quasi 2.500 euro (precisamente 2.484), con punte di 3.456 euro a Firenze, di 3.603 a Bologna, di 3.645 a Modena, di 4.058 a Bolzano e addirittura di 5.575 euro a Milano. A stimare la contrazione del valore aggiunto per abitante a livello provinciale è stato l'Ufficio studi della CGIA che, inoltre, ha denunciato un altro dato particolarmente allarmante: anche se subirà una riduzione del Pil più contenuta rispetto a tutte le altre macro aree del Paese (-9%), il Sud vedrà scivolare il Pil allo stesso livello del 1989.

TEHRAN — President Hassan Rouhani has advised the next U.S. administration to return to its commitments and respect the rule of law, and to realize that their approach toward Iran has been wrong all along.
 “Our people faced economic terrorism in the last three years, and in this regard, they showed remarkable resistance, patience and endurance,” Rouhani said on Saturday.

Some polling spots did not have enough ballots, or had too many ballots cast for the number of voters registered, some had names spelled incorrectly, the list of infractions resembled a Central American banana republic. For the most technologically advanced nation on the planet, I was given a paper ballot (first time that ever occurred) to be fed into a pristine electronic machine that resembled more of an ATM, where the irony was almost laughable.
 The bipartisan expectation and perhaps the only thing both sides of the aisle agree on is continued rioting and long, drawn-out legal battles, which only underscores there is no real winner.
 Regrettably, politics has become the most dominant attribute of our culture – an unhealthy condition for any society. A protracted legal challenge has the proclivity to generate a lack of conviction in an orderly, and traditional constitutional outcome.
 We have arrived at this historical juncture through the unceasing implementation of identity politics where everything is predicated on race, national origin and sexual orientation. All of this has been carefully orchestrated by the national media that has resisted a legally elected American president even before he took the oath of office.
 Given the historic voter turnout and its ensuing political engagement from coast to coast only underscores how the Electoral College was a stroke of genius by the Founding Fathers and should no longer be a point of contention.
 The chaotic trajectory that mass voting by mail produced should never be undertaken again, except for absentee ballots. Over a million mail-in votes are likely to be disqualified and discarded, as reported by The Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
 Earlier this year, three battleground states Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania rejected around 60,000 primary ballots. In addition, states have varying deadlines with absentee and overseas ballots. Some have until December 12 to certify election results, which means that there would be weeks of chicanery and legal disputes over discarded ballots.

But the War Eagles couldn't score again until their final possession, when Durham threw across the field on a 21-yard TD pass to Matthew Meersman.
 Between the two scores, Durham threw three interceptions and Denmark's offense scored a touchdown on five of six drives (Thompson made an interception on a wide receiver pass just before halftime).
 "We can seem to start, we just can't seem to finish," Arnette said. "That's on me, you know? Dadgum head coach has got to find a way to be able to start and finish the game. I just haven't been able to get us there yet. We've got our backs up against the wall big time. We're going to have to win two ball games to get in the playoffs and keep this streak going — the longest in the county."
 Durham went 17 of 25 for 313 yards and Thompson hauled in seven passes for 199 yards.
 Harrison Halder made an interception off a tipped pass on South's first drive after halftime, then Kenon Dicks picked off Durham two drives later. Treston Jordan had an interception in the second quarter.
 "We wanted them to work down the field," Denmark head coach Mike Palmieri said. "No big plays, you know what I mean? I thought early we played a little too soft and kind of let them get a little free on the runs, so we tightened it up. We just want them to drive the football."
 Williams scored two more touchdowns for the Danes — an 11-yard run to open the third quarter, then a 4-yard TD that capped a 13-play drive and made the score 36-15.
 Brandon Roel set up the score with a 46-yard run down to South's 4-yard line, but Roel was penalized for celebrating during the run, which brought the ball back to the 39-yard line and allowed the Danes to chew more clock.

“We've had the Buck Creek Trail Greenway that we had developed, and so we were looking at ways to, first and foremost, get people out to the greenway and bring people out to that hidden gem in the city,” Hamm said. “It started out as an arts and crafts thing to get people out into the city and enjoy the outside, and it turned into a huge event. We incorporated a kids’ event and we turned it into a trick-or-treat event as well, and that is the biggest draw of the whole event. This year, especially with the people making adjustments for Halloween with COVID, everything was well attended and kids were able to get candy safely and enjoy and be a part of the event.”

“During this temporary school closure, parents will play a vital role in ensuring that children are engaged in remote learning to the maximum extent possible. We know this will be challenging, however, our dedicated teachers will continue serving our students remotely,” Stair continued. “We appreciate your flexibility as we work through the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our community.”
 The update noted that “as of today” the district’s plan is to return to in- person learning in district buildings on Tuesday, Dec. 1.
 “Thank you for your cooperation and understanding during this difficult pandemic,” Stair’s statement read. “I can assure you this was not an easy decision, but a decision that needed to be made during this time.”

AMD Ryzen 7 5700U ‘Lucienne Renoir Refresh’ APU Powered Acer Aspire 5 1515 Notebook Detailed
 The motherboard was shown running an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12 core processor along with 16 GB of DDR4 memory and even supports AMD's Ryzen 4000G Renoir APUs. It looks like motherboard makers already have BIOS's for X370 & A320 motherboards in the works but we don't expect them to roll them out anytime soon since AMD has officially stated that Ryzen 5000 Desktop CPUs will be only supported by 400 and 500-series motherboards.
