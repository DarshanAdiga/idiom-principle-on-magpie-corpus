NEWPORT -- Given the seasonal nature of the City-by-the-Sea, January is known to be one of the slower months for Newport businesses. But last January took that to an extreme.


  Beginning Jan. 21, 2019, Newport and part of Middletown experienced a loss of gas service leaving more than 7,000 customers without heat.


  "I said it before and I'll say it again, [National Grid] did a terrific job taking care of the residents and people in need. It should have been and it was the top priority. When it came to businesses, they didn't give much thought or care about what happened to businesses," Richard Sardella, owner of Sardella's Italian Restaurant said. "I think you'd find very few businesses in town that wouldn't agree."


  Restaurant sales lost in comparison to the same time period in years prior amounted to around $21,000, Sardella said.


  "It's a significant amount of money. Our employees missed out on wages," Sardella said, adding that National Grid didn't reimburse "one single penny."


  The restaurant didn't recoup any of the money lost through National Grid, insurance or otherwise.


  Looking at the year as a whole, "It didn't have a significant impact on the entire year, it certainly did the week we were out of gas," he said.


  "Originally we were part of a class action suit. It really wasn't going anywhere, National Grid wasn't showing much support for businesses. Instead of incurring the legal fees we decided not to pursue it," Sardella said.


  The lawsuit included Sardella's Italian Restaurant, Stoneacre Brasserie, Stoneacre Tapas, O'Brien's Pub and Scales & Shells as the plaintiffs represented by local attorneys Robert Karns and John Fulweiler.


  The plaintiffs sought compensation and damages to "make them whole again" and punitive damages, The Daily News reported at the time.


  As Sardella noted, the lawsuit was withdrawn soon after.


  Looking back one year later, Sardella said business is going well. "It's one of those things that happen, and you put it behind you and move forward," Sardella said.


  Stoneacre Brasserie wasn't reimbursed by National Grid either, though insurance coverage mitigated some of the losses, co-owner Christopher Bender said.


  "We were impacted for a week and had to close for three days. We were fortunate to have mostly electric appliances so we were able to limp along for a while," Bender said.


  Looking back one year later and having 2019 year end numbers in mind, "We're happy to be where we are. Overall, we were able to bounce through it and the coverage worked," Bender said.


  Restaurants weren't alone. Retail was affected as well, and it wasn't just for the week without heat.


  "It really affected us more the week after than it did during that week," Rob Lasky, owner of Life is Good told The Daily News. "Even though we had power and heat, people weren't coming to town because they didn't know. It really affected us more after, honestly. People were saying, 'There's no [heat], so I'm not going to Newport.'"


  Lasky said people were likely steering clear of Newport not realizing if the heat had been turned back on.


  And in one case, a business had to close for good. A burst water pipe that damaged Mr. Tim's Kid Corner forced its founder and operator, Tim Johnson, to permanently close the free-to-use play space on Broadway, The Daily News reported at the time.


  "I would want the community to know this was one of the Aquidneck Island casualties due to a fiercely cold storm followed by a freak accident in a gas line somewhere," he wrote in an email to The Daily News after closing.      Johnson did not have personal property insurance for the storefront, only liability insurance. A loan to restore Kid Corner, given its lack of operational funding, didn't make sense, Johnson said.


  Next door to Mr. Tim's, in the same building, Water Brothers surf and skateboard shop also sustained damages. Sid Abbruzzi, the owner told The Daily News that water seeped down from the ceiling, damaging about $10,000 in merchandise and $3,000 in TVs and a point-of-sales system.


  In the year since the gas outage, Water Brothers moved into the former Mr. Tim's, and then moved again to 39 Memorial Boulevard.


  But for others, the gas outage didn't make much of an impact at all.


  "The gas outage was not a significant event for us. Given the time of year and the improvisations we were able to pull off, like cooking on a wood grill, we did not feel any pain in the short or the long run," Michael Jenkins, general manager of The Clarke Cooke House said. The restaurant on Bannister's Wharf was closed to the public for 24 hours.


  "We received a 60% reimbursement for the expenses we incurred to secure the building," Jenkins added, citing expenses for portable heaters.

Clancy Anderson, livestock show coordinator for the National Western Stock Show, said the goal was to expose students to as many veterinary options as possible, and maybe steer some from going down a career path that won't work for them.
 "I think that a lot of kids go to school for undergrad thinking, 'I'm going to be a vet,' and then they're in vet school for two years and they're like, 'Dang, I don't know if I want to be a vet,' " she said.
 Many of the predominantly female group members seemed reasonably confident they wanted to be vets or veterinary technicians. Addie Morris, a 16-year-old who attends Denver's George Washington High School, said she's debating between specializing in horses or small animals, and hoped to get more hands- on experience at the camp.
 "I've always come to the Stock Show growing up, and it's cool to see how (the animals) are cared for behind the scenes," she said.
 The volunteer horse, Buck, cooperated with the first few groups, but was too nervous to let the final students listen to his heart and examine him. That's not unusual for horses, who would be a prey animal in the wild, said Dr. Sara Senn, who works at Littleton Equine Medical Center. Still, she was able to give the students an overview of the kind of injuries and illnesses that are most common in horses.
 "These horses are athletes, for the most part," she said. "The same kinds of injuries we see in our human athletes, we see in horses."
 Over at the small animal station, however, Paisley the corgi was in her element, following her nose as far as the leash would allow and getting pats between demonstrations.

Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu has emphasised the need to make classical Telugu understandable to common people.


  Addressing the valedictory session of a workshop organised by the Centre of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu (CESCT), Mr. Venkaiah Naidu called for the use of technology to popularise the Telugu language by digitalising old texts.


  “CESCT must promote Telugu education in the country and abroad, and popularise the rich cultural heritage of classical Telugu by publishing and translating its works into other languages. It should also digitilise the ancient literature and texts, including palm manuscripts, for the benefit of GenX and conduct research on classical music, various classical dance forms and link them with classical language,” Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said.


  Calling for a movement to promote all regional languages, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said that he wanted State governments to chip in with their contributions to nurture the mother tongue. In this context, he called for providing basic education in one's mother tongue.


  “The Centre is fully committed to nurturing classical languages. The decision to shift the CESCT from Mysuru to Nellore was taken as it would be a more appropriate place for the purpose,” Union Human Resources Development Minister Ramesh Pokhrial ‘Nishank’ said.


  He also called for a wider debate on the present examination system with a view to undertaking reforms in the education system.


  CESCT was set up under the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru after Telugu was recognised as a Classical Language in 2008.


  Thanks to the intervention of Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, CESCT, which had hitherto been functioning in Mysuru, was shifted to Nellore after Swarna Bharat Trust Managing Trustee Deepa Venkat offered to house the CESCT in its premises for three to four years free of cost.


  Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia are the other languages that have been declared as classical languages.


  ## Roadmap


  More than 200 scholars and experts of Telugu classical language who participated in the workshop chaired by Prof. D.G.Rao, Director of Central Institute of Indian Languagues, came out with a roadmap on the preservation, propagation and promotion of classical Telugu so that the richness of the language could be taken to greater heights, according to CESCT Director Prof. D. Muniratnam Naidu.


  Earlier, interacting with students at Akshara Vidyalaya and Skill Development Centre, the Vice-President highlighted the nutritional values of traditional Indian foods and pointed out that consumption of junk foods led to lifestyle diseases. He also urged the students to respect their elders. “They should love and live in tune with nature,” the Vice-President said.

While Alliance's city officials retained their seats in the November election, City Council had a bit of upheaval.  


  Of course, council has undergone much change over the past two years.  


  On Nov. 5, Mayor Alan Andreani came out on top of the mayor's race, defeating Democrat David Smith to win a third term in office.  


  Andreani claimed 60 percent of the vote en route to the victory.  


  "I have to thank all the citizens and supporters for what they have done for me and Alliance," Andreani said Nov. 5. "We are looking forward to a lot of improvements in 2020. Our goal has been to make Alliance a quality place to live."  


  The mayor singled out the new dog park that should open next year, the completion of the Iron Horse hiking and bicycle riding trail and a beautification project for Union Avenue that will include new street lights, curbs and sidewalks.  


  Andreani, prior to becoming mayor, served four terms as an at-large member of City Council. Before entering city politics, Andreani was superintendent of Marlington Local Schools.  


  It was Smith's third unsuccessful bid for office in Alliance, having lost bids for City Council at-large seats in 2015 and 2017.  


  The Republican Party increased its majority on the seven-member City Council as newcomer Phillip Mastroianni claimed one of the three at-large seats. He joins fellow Republicans Andrew Grove and Kristopher Bugara as at-large councilmen.  


  Mastroianni's victory cost Democrat Brian Simeone his post. He finished fourth in the five-candidate race. David Thomas, who ran as an independent, finished last.  


  Mastroianni works with his family's commercial development company called Alliance Ventures.  


  "I am extremely excited about it," Mastroianni said. "I am ecstatic. It is very humbling to see all the support through the voters."  


  The city's other officials on the ballot, all Republicans, were re-elected without opponents. They are Municipal Court Judge Andrew Zumbar; Law Director Jennifer Arnold; Clerk of Court MaryAnne Carper; Auditor Kevin Knowles; and City Council President Arthur Garnes.  


  City Council members who were re-elected without opposition were Sheila Cherry, D-1; Cindy King, D-2; and James Edwards, R-4. Councilman L. Frank Minear Jr., R-3, also ran without opposition. This is Minear's first time on the ballot, as he was appointed to fill an unexpired term.

Talented artists used Alliance structures as canvasses in 2019, adding murals to beautify the city.  


  In August, as part of the 2019 Greater Alliance Carnation Festival, a dedication ceremony was held outside of the Alliance Area Chamber of Commerce on East Main Street for a mural of Dr. Levi Lamborn, the Alliance doctor, horticulturist and politician responsible for Alliance's nickname.  


  The mural depicting Lamborn and some of his history and contributions to Alliance is located on the side of the Chamber of Commerce office.  


  The effort was one of many commissioned by Sherry and Jay Groom, owners of the Troll Hole Museum, in an effort to improve facades on East Main Street. The local couple has been working to create a tourist district in the hopes of bringing tourists to the Carnation City.  


  The new mural joined others in downtown Alliance -- from a fantasy landscape and angel wings to animals and an enchanted train.  


  Groom said she got the inspiration for the Lamborn mural from the Beech Creek Gardens' Levi Lamborn Museum and related art competition. It was designed by David McDowell, resident artist at the Troll Hole, who painted a fourth of it.  


  The majority was painted by Steve Dasgupta, an artist from Kolkata, India, who Groom found on an internship website. He came over on a visitor's visa, spending about three weeks on the Lamborn project and more time on other painting projects downtown.  


  During a brief dedication ceremony, McDowell even took on the appearance of Lamborn, wearing time period clothing and giving his beard a similar look to Lamborn. He then spoke about Lamborn's history and ventures in Alliance, which included starting the first newspaper in Alliance, his work with carnations and his connection to William McKinley.  


  The mural includes the cover of the first edition of Lamborn's book, "American Carnation Culture," the first issue of the newspaper, four flowers taken from an illustration in his book, the only existing photo of Lamborn, the President McKinley statue and a label from Lamborn's son's floral shop.  


  McDowell also created a plaque about Lamborn that is affixed to the wall next to the mural. He said the goal with the murals is to get people talking, create something that all generations can enjoy and increase city pride.  


  It was Lamborn's creation that was depicted in a mural at Silver Park, which was unveiled around the same time.  


  Talented local muralist Dirk Rozich, who grew up in the West Branch area, spent nearly 80 hours over two months painting a giant 28-foot scarlet carnation on the wall of the Sound Stage. Along with the enormous, single-stem red carnation are the words "Alliance, Ohio. The Carnation City."  


  The dramatic three-dimensional carnation offers a great opportunity for area residents to take creative photos, as a person can stand at the base of the stem and simulate "holding" the giant flower. Jennifer Mastroianni, vice president of the Park Board, said the flower was designed with fun, photography, social media and marketing in mind.  


  The park staff and board approached Rozich about the idea in the spring, with the hopes of having the mural done for Carnation Days in the Park in August, but Mother Nature didn't make it easy on him.  


  Rozich had to work around weather and other obstacles. But neither June's torrential rain, nor July's searing heat, nor dark of night, nor swooping bats, nor an untimely yoga session in the park kept him from missing the deadline.  


  The carnation is the first mural Rozich has painted in Alliance. He has several outdoor public works in and around Stark County, including the Joe Namath Super Bowl mural at the Cultural Center for the Arts in Canton, and the Birth of the NFL mural at Canton City Hall. He also created the Schreckengost Park mural in downtown Sebring.  


  Even Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had something to say about the addition of the mural, which he said would make Alliance even more of a tourist destination.  


  "There is so much to see and do in Ohio, including in the Carnation City," DeWine said. "Alliance is a great place to appreciate our state flower, the red carnation, which has been our state flower for over a hundred years. President William McKinley, an Ohioan, was known for wearing a red carnation in his lapel, and the flower was adopted as the state flower in his memory. It's great to see this state symbol being showcased today."
