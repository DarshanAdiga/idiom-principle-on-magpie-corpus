Another citizen whose name is inscribed in Cape Girardeau's hall of fame is the late Will Hirsch, a native son who made good in business and still had considerable time to devote to the community.

He was a retiring, unpretentious man, not particularly a leader, but one who always wanted to do his share.

Jofra Archer has responded to Michael Holding's comments about England and Australia players not taking a knee in support of the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement, saying it was harsh on the former West Indies quick's part. Holding, who has been a vocal supported of the BLM movement had found it 'lame' that England, Pakistan and Australia failed to continue the practice of taking a knee which began when the English summer began in August.Archer, in his response, said that Holding may not be aware of it but the England cricket team is actively supporting the movement 'in the background' and that the former Windies quick should have not said what he did without doing proper research."I'm pretty sure Michael Holding doesn't know anything that is going on behind the scenes.

Many private colleges affiliated to Madurai Kamaraj University are likely to postpone the semester examinations which were scheduled for September 16 onwards, following a direction from the State government.
 A discussion was held between Principals and the MKU administration via video conferencing, here on Monday. Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan, who presided over the meeting, said 80 Principals attended the meeting and discussed the process of conducting the exam online. “Question papers will be mailed to the Principals by 9 a.m. The question papers must be given to the students by 9.45 a.m. so that they start the three-hour exam between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m.," he said.
 Students can either scan and send their answer sheet via email to the Principal, submit it at the college or send their answer scripts via post by 2 p.m. for evaluation. “In case the students do not have email facility, the Principals can consider sending the questions via WhatsApp. The reason should be genuine though,” he said.
 According to sources, a number of queries regarding logistics and the conduct of the exams were raised.
 Principal of Saraswathi Narayanan College M. Kannan, who attended the meeting, said they were yet to get clarity on many questions raised to the administration. His college had initially scheduled the final year exams this week but had postponed them to September 21.
 “The administration has said that only 80% of the students have access to internet connectivity. How are we to accommodate the 20% who may not have a connection? Many students do not have smartphones and may feel inferior to those who may possess them. They may also believe that it may cost them marks during the exam. Many students may also not have the necessary internet bandwidth for the exam even if they do have a smart phone," he said.
 General secretary of Madurai Kamaraj University Private Colleges Management Association S. Rajagopal said there were no means to supervise students during the online exam. “We are treading uncharted territory. Future of many students could be spoiled,” he said.

"On Earth we do have phosphine gas that comes from volcanic sources," planetary scientist Helen Maynard-Casely of Australia's Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation told ScienceAlert. Maynard-Casely was not involved in the research.
 "This is ruled out in this paper, because they judge the amount of phosphine they observe could not be supported by volcanoes alone. I find this a little surprising, as there is abundant evidence for volcanic activity on Venus, much more than on Earth, plus we have much less of an idea of what the Venus surface is made out of."
 Greaves' team is also careful to point out that there may be an unknown chemical process driving the synthesis of phosphine on Venus. Given the challenges of studying the planet up close - Venus has fried more than one lander, with none surviving more than a couple of hours - we don't understand its surface well at all, so unknown chemistry or geology is a strong possibility.
 "It could suggest a whole reaction network we hadn't discovered before, or abundance of, for example, phosphorus-bearing minerals that's a lot different to Earth," Greaves told ScienceAlert.
 Whatever is producing the phosphine signature in Venus' atmosphere, finding the answer is going to teach us something new - whether that's something about chemistry, phosphorus and the processes that create phosphine… or whether it's something about the tenacity of life itself.
 "A lot of the search for biology occurring elsewhere than our own Earth is centred around finding a place where biology as we know it on Earth can survive. This is the reason why Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede are seen as potential spots for hosting biological activity, because they are both thought to have oceans under their ice surfaces that would be rich in minerals and sheltered from the viscous space weather, not unlike our own oceans," Maynard-Casely said.
 "If we found evidence for biology occurring in a place that nothing on Earth could survive in, then that really does throw the doors open that a multitude of biological activity could be happening, perhaps all over the Solar System."
 The next steps in solving this mystery may be easier said than done, however. We can take more observations using powerful telescopes. But we may need closer observations, either from an orbiting probe, of which currently only one, JAXA's Akatsuki, is operational, or - much more challenging - a lander.
 There are several proposed missions to Venus in the pipeline, but it's often a long time between proposal and execution.
 In the meantime, modelling and experimentation could start narrowing down the possibilities.
 "It's very hard to prove a negative. Now, astronomers will think of all the ways to justify phosphine without life, and I welcome that," said molecular astrophysicist Clara Sousa-Silva of MIT.
 "Please do, because we are at the end of our possibilities to show abiotic processes that can make phosphine."
 The research has been published in _Nature Astronomy_.

Across the city, lines at pantries stretched for blocks. Social distancing was complicating food distribution efforts, and many pantries lost older volunteers who stayed home due to high risk of severe effects of COVID-19. A network of churches, volunteers, city government offices, restaurants and immigrant centers stepped in to fill the void.
 In May, Vinson saw a Facebook post seeking volunteers for a pantry run by a restaurant owner and a Baptist church, providing hundreds of meals to people in need along with notes bearing inspirational prayers or good wishes such as “What doesn’t kill you will build you.”
 “I said, you know what? That’s something that’s up my alley,” said Vinson, whose job before injury and the pandemic was at a shelter for people with mental illnesses and chemical addictions.
 Vinson also felt she could set an example for her children. She began bringing Jasmin and the twins to help distribute the food as fellow volunteers, helping teach them values she got from her own mother. It was also a way to make sure her kids got at least one meal a day, from the pantry.
 Things seemed to be looking up, but protests and clashes sparked by the police killing of George Floyd raised haunting memories of the incident from earlier in the year when police stormed the apartment building searching for a shooting suspect and pointed their guns at Mason as he was cleaning the litter for his cat, Shadow.
 It traumatized the boy and made him angry at police, she said. One day this summer, as she sat outside watching the latest protest, a neighbor called out her name. Across the street, Mason was jumping up and down on top of a patrol car. Vinson ran over.
 “And when I grabbed him and I went to chastise him, I was at a loss for words, because how do I tell you not to be angry when four of their brothers in blue had guns to your head?” she said. “How do I tell you not to retaliate?”
 Soon after, she called her ex-partner in North Carolina, and on June 4 the twins headed south.
 Living without them was hard, she said, but it bought her time to stabilize her ability to provide for them. She saved up food stamps and some money, and found a job working for the 2020 U.S. Census.
 One day she asked the restaurant owner who ran the pantry if she could bring back some trays for her housing complex. That effort has since grown to dozens of meals plus groceries and protective face masks that she and other volunteers distribute each Saturday.
 The twins finally came home in August, in time for Maddison to celebrate her remote graduation from middle school along with friends and family and for Mason to take part in the first practice of the Brooklyn United Youth Football season.
 The police department apologized for the incident involving Mason and hosted him and a group of other kids and their families to discuss their concerns over pizza and chicken wings with high-ranking officers.
 “These kids have been enduring a lot in the last couple of months, from the COVID wave to the Black Lives Matter, to the protesters, to the police brutality,” Vinson said. “And not too many times people stop and ask, How do they feel?”
 The coronavirus outbreak has slowed significantly in New York compared with earlier this year. But times remain tough: Their rent is four months overdue, and the cable is about to be cut off. On a recent day the bathroom flooded, sending water running through the halls.
 Still, Vinson feels fortunate.
 “There’s so many people who are out here who are hungry,” she said. “I got my grandson, I got my kids and I got my life. What do I got to complain about?”

But DOD leadership need not wait for all the data to come in – it must to continue on listening tours of not only enlisted personnel and officers, but, as the task force did in 1972, speaking with chaplains, medical officers, and visiting small business owners and other community members to get a full picture of military life for minorities on and off-base. As Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. John Hyten recently implored personnel, “tell us exactly what's bothering them.” These stories will be the most important data points to obtain.

SALEM, Ore. - As wildfires exploded and smoke choked communities across the western U.S. this week, residents in Oregon watched the sky change from a deep orange-red on Tuesday to yellow later in the week and then to a foggy white this weekend.
 Nearly 95 large wildfires have wreaked havoc through Oregon and other western states, and residents throughout have noticed changes to the sky, even miles away from the blazes.
 Orange and red-tinged photos making Oregon look like a movie set from Mars have made their way around the world. A Reddit photo of a UPS truck with a red background has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The photos look so strange that Snopes, a fact-checking website, even created a post verifying that Oregon's skies really were that color.
 It's all about how the sun is bouncing off of what's in the atmosphere, National Weather Service Meteorologist Rebecca Muessle said.
 "The reason the sky is blue is because light is scattering off of the water vapor," Muessle said. "When it comes to the smoke, the light is reflecting a different color."
 Over the past week, Salem, Oregon, residents saw a shift from bright orange hues on Tuesday, to a more subdued charcoal color by Sunday.
 That "has to do with the amount and size of ash and other smoke particles from the fires," she said.
 "On Tuesday, the particulate matter that was put into the air was more direct from the fire, so it's going to be smaller than it is right now … so that was reflecting the light differently than right now, which is more suspended and larger in size," Muessle said.
 With less light coming through, the sky appears more "hazy" because "you're seeing more of the true color of that particulate matter," she said.
 A layer of smoke extends from Portland, all the way down to Santa Barbara, Calif, Drew Peterson, a California-based National Weather Service meteorologist, said.
 Pilot and instrument reports confirm the smoke layer is sitting between 2,000 and 6,000 feet above the ground.
 The sunlight filtering through that smoky filter is primarily longer- wavelength colors: red, orange and yellow. The shorter wavelength indigos, greens and violets that make up the rest of the ROYGBIV rainbow are blocked by smoke particles, Peterson said.
 "We're only picking up a third to half of the light coming from the sun," he said.
 Dan Jacobson, director of Environment California, said he believed the apocalyptic sky could be detrimental to people's mental health after everything they've been through in the past few months.
 "It's frustrating and scary," he said. "Makes you want to throw your hands up in the air and just kind of give up."
 The smoke also continues to impact the quality of the air in Salem, Eugene and other areas in Oregon.
 The Air Quality Index, or AQI, for Salem is over 400, according to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. Air quality is considered hazardous between 301 and 500. Values above 500 are beyond the AQI scale.
 An air quality advisory runs through midday Monday. Until then, everyone is advised to stay indoors to reduce their exposure.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s massive campaign war chest was supposed to finance an onslaught of attacks that would destroy Joe Biden’s chance of winning in November.
 But after months of profligate spending, the attacks did little to diminish the Democratic nominee's standing. Trump’s formidable cash advantage has evaporated. And it is Biden who over the past month has outspent Trump by nearly double, advertising data shows.
 Coming off a record-shattering $364 million August fundraising haul, Biden is pouring tens of millions of dollars into a torrent of ads airing in battleground states. The aim is to get out his message of competent leadership, while pinning blame on Trump for a lost year, wracked by disease, unrest and economic hardship.
 Trump's campaign, meanwhile, has implemented recent belt-tightening measures and went dark on TV multiple times in August to conserve resources, worrying allies that Democrats could drown him out on TV with weeks left in the campaign.
 On Monday, the Trump campaign canceled at least $2.5 million worth of advertising that was planned for Iowa, Ohio and Nevada, where he campaigned over the weekend, the data shows. Last week he also canceled ads in those states, as well as in Arizona, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania.
 “It should be an alarm to every Republican donor that they’ve got to dig deep and give more,” said David McIntosh, a former Indiana congressman who leads the conservative Club for Growth, which has come to Trump's aid by running commercials on his behalf. “Fox News will help carry (Trump's) message, but the mainstream media won’t. That means he’s got to have enough resources to go over their heads and talk directly with voters.”

The Board of Parole, mindful of trying to reduce the prison population during COVID-19, took steps that included allowing two boards to work simultaneously to release more offenders who were not considered high risk, said Lynn Hicks, spokesman for the Iowa Attorney General.
 “The Board and Department have identified logical targets relative to expedited release options in light of this current COVID-19 reality,” Board Vice Chair Andrew Boettger said in an April 3 news release.
 While Iowa is the only state in the country that doesn’t have a compassionate release law, which allows early release for terminal illness, extreme old age or sickness, the Corrections Department and Parole Board have worked to identify more offenders who could be paroled during the pandemic.

 “The said statement, in my considered opinion, amounts to contempt of court as the integrity and devotion of honourable judges as well as the judicial system of our great nation are not only undermined but criticised in a bad shape,” the judge had said.
 Countering his views, the six retired judges said, “We are afraid that such a construction made on the statement of Mr. Suriya will be slightly off the mark.”
 Pointing out that the actor, involved in social work such as educating children and finding employment for youngsters through his Agaram Foundation, had made the statement in a surcharged atmosphere, when as many as four students had committed suicide in the State one after the other due to fear of NEET, the former judges said: “An artistic person’s over reaction should not be taken seriously and out of context.”
 Separately, 25 High Court lawyers including N.G.R. Prasad, Sudha Ramalingam, Anna Mathew, designated senior counsel V. Prakash, V. Suresh of People’s Union for Civil Liberties, D. Nagasaila, T. Mohan & D. Geetha also wrote a letter to the Chief Justice stating that the actor’s statement was just an expression of opinion and not a contemptuous act.
 “Of late, every criticism of the judiciary is being seen as contemptuous. As practising lawyers, we feel that if expression of an opinion is treated as contempt, it would amount to stifling the freedom of speech and expression. This would have a chilling effect on basic constitutional guarantees,” they said.
 “The Supreme Court too has held that dissent is the safety valve of democracy. In a democratic country governed by the rule of law, there should be space for a wide array of opinions on any issue. We, therefore, request your Lordship not to initiate contempt and thereby uphold the majesty of the law and of courts,” their representation read.
 On the contrary, Tamil Nadu Advocates Association led by designated senior counsel S. Prabakaran, who was also the vice-chairman of Bar Council of India, wrote to the Chief Justice stating that Suriya’s statement was highly condemnable. He said it was the Supreme Court which had ordered for conduct of NEET this year and hence the actor’s criticism of such an order passed by the apex court amounted to interference in judicial functions.
 Accusing Mr. Suriya of making such statements for the sake of publicity, the TNAA said he had crossed the limits this time by accusing judges of conducting virtual courts due to fear for their lives. According to TNAA courts had been dispensing justice even during the troubled times of COVID-19 and they had disposed of a good number of cases through both physical and virtual hearings. Actors must be responsible and not make public statements like movie dialogues, it said.

A rebound in crop production after three years of drought-hit seasons is not expected to deliver bumper earnings across Australia's agricultural sector.
 ABARES' September Agriculture Commodities report released on Tuesday forecasts the gross value of production to stay unchanged at $61 billion.
 "The value of crop production is forecast to increase by 17 per cent to over $32 billion on the back of much improved seasonal conditions, particularly in New South Wales," ABARES executive director Dr Steve Hatfield-Dodds said.
 "But while crop production volumes are forecast to grow strongly, they will be offset by a hit to earnings brought about by strong global supply and COVID-19 induced lower prices."
 As well, the rebuilding of herds and flocks will hit overall production with the value of livestock production forecast to fall by 14 per cent to $28.9 billion.
 "These developments will hit the sector's exports significantly, with falling commodity prices, reduced livestock product exports and grain stock rebuilding expected to shave 10 per cent off the value of agricultural exports, which are forecast to fall to $43.5 billion in 2020/21," Dr Hatfield-Dodds said.
 Agricultural trade has been less affected than other goods because shipping has been less disrupted than other forms of transport.
 The sector is closely watching the appreciating Australian dollar as well as a potential shortage of horticultural labour for the summer harvest.
 If labour shortages reduce harvests, fresh produce prices would increase.
 There is also the risk that a new wave of COVID-19 restrictions in Australia or in key overseas markets could impact on consumer spending and supply chains.
 The ABARES report also noted trade tensions with China could add further risks to the outlook.
 "Agricultural trade with China continues to be very strong despite these tensions. China has ranked as the highest value destination for Australian agricultural exports every month since February 2011."

LONDON (AP) — Developing countries' difficulty in containing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic will keep a lid on global oil demand, particularly in India, the OPEC cartel said Monday as it cut its forecasts.OPEC cut its estimates for world demand by 400,000 barrels a day for both this year and next. It now sees a drop in demand of 9.5 million barrels a day in 2020 and a rise of 6.6 million barrels in 2021.“Risks remain elevated and skewed to the downside, particularly in relation to the development of COVID-19 infection cases and potential vaccines,” the cartel said in a monthly report on the industry.Besides the trouble in some developing countries, which together with the United States have had a harder time than Europe or China in limiting the first wave of virus contagions, OPEC said it expected a slow pick-up in energy demand for transportation in rich countries. Airlines around the world are flying only a fraction of their normal amount of traffic, with a full recovery not expected for another couple of years.The price of oil plunged during the initial phase of the pandemic as businesses and transportation ground to a halt around the world. The uncertainty surrounding the industry, coupled with concerns about climate change, has pushed some major oil companies to shift more aggressively towards renewable energy or natural gas.BP says it expects demand for crude oil to peak in the early 2020s. If governments become more aggressive about reducing carbon emissions, demand might never recover from the current slump, its said in a report on the industry’s outlook.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Jofra Archer has responded to Michael Holding's comments about England and Australia players not taking a knee in support of the BLM (Black Lives Matter) movement, saying it was harsh on the former West Indies quick's part. Holding, who has been a vocal supported of the BLM movement had found it 'lame' that England, Pakistan and Australia failed to continue the practice of taking a knee which began when the English summer began in August.
 Archer, in his response, said that Holding may not be aware of it but the England cricket team is actively supporting the movement 'in the background' and that the former Windies quick should have not said what he did without doing proper research.
 "I'm pretty sure Michael Holding doesn't know anything that is going on behind the scenes. I don't think he has spoken to [ECB chief executive] Tom Harrison," Archer said.
 "I've spoken to Tom and we have stuff running in the background. We've not forgotten. No-one here has forgotten about Black Lives Matter. I think that is a bit harsh for him to say that. I think it is a bit harsh for Mikey to not do some research before criticising."
   
   
 Holding, however, did not hold back on his response to Archer, saying irrespective of whatever is being done to support BLM by the ECB, there is no connection between that and the gesture that is taking a knee. "Taking a knee does not prevent other action from taking place," Holding told ESPNCricinfo.
 "Those who take a knee are not substituting the gesture for other positive action. Nobody should have a problem with it. It is a worldwide recognition of calling attention to racial prejudice and injustice."

If the 1st match is held on the 17th, it means that the RC will be pushed back and the All Blacks won’t be out of quarantine before Christmas.

 Sawant, one of the four arrested, has five police cases registered against him in the past.

MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Cubs right-hander Alec Mills cruised through baseball's second no-hitter this season, completing the 16th such gem in Chicago franchise history in a 12-0 romp over the Milwaukee Brewers on Sunday.
   
 Mills got Jace Peterson -- who replaced star slugger Christian Yelich late in the blowout -- to hit a routine grounder to shortstop Javier Baez with two outs in the ninth. Baez completed the play, and the Cubs swarmed around Mills, tearing off his cap and pulling at the smiling right-hander's uniform after his first career complete game in his 15th start.
   
 "It just hasn't really hit me yet," Mills said. "It's kind of crazy, I didn't even know how to celebrate. Just something that all came together today. Obviously a memory I'll have forever."
   
 Mills (5-3) threw 114 pitches and hardly had any close calls. Avisail Garcia nearly got to him twice, hitting a line drive to right in the first and nearly legging out an infield hit to shortstop in the sixth. Garcia crossed first and immediately called to the Brewers dugout for a review, but after a very brief stoppage, the Brewers opted not to challenge.
   
 Mills would have faced Garcia again in the ninth, but Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell had pulled Garcia and Yelich with his team trailing big. Mills struck out Garcia's replacement, Tyrone Taylor for the second out in the ninth.
   
 "It kind of surprised me," Mills said. "Taylor hitting there and then Peterson, I had no idea they were in the game."
   
 Mills struck out five and walked three. His five strikeouts are the fewest in a Cubs no-hitter since Ken Holtzman in 1969. He only induced five swings and misses, tied with Oakland's Dallas Braden during his perfect game in 2010 for fewest in a no-hitter since at least 1988, per Stats Inc.
   
 Chicago White Sox ace Lucas Giolito threw baseball's other no-hitter this season against the Pirates on Aug. 15. It is the first time Sox and Cubs pitchers have no-hit a team in the same season.
   
 Mills was a 22nd-round draft pick by Kansas City in 2012. He had started just six major league games prior to this season but cracked Chicago's rotation because of an injury to Jose Quintana. He went 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA in his first two starts, struggled in his next five but pitched solidly Tuesday against the Reds with six shutout innings. He entered Sunday 4-3 with a 4.74 ERA this season.
   
 Not bad for a player who couldn't get a college scholarship. Mills was a walk- on at Tennessee-Martin.
   
 "Never give up," Mills said. "You know, some people are going to tell you you can't do it or you're not good enough. That's just one person. So just keep working. Just persevere."
   
 The 28-year-old happily took high-fives as teammates got close during the celebration -- a no-no no-no amid the coronavirus pandemic that didn't concern players in the moment.
   
 Their yells of congratulations echoed around the empty stadium, which has yet to have Brewers fans in attendance for a no-hitter. Cubs pitcher Carlos Zambrano had thrown the only no-hitter at Miller Park, against the Houston Astros on Sept. 14, 2008. The Cubs played the Astros in Milwaukee because of damage in the Houston area from Hurricane Ike.
   
 Mills completed the Cubs' first no-hitter since Jake Arrieta did it twice in a few months: at the Los Angeles Dodgers on Aug. 30, 2015, and at Cincinnati on April 21, 2016.
   
 Milwaukee had not been held hitless since Detroit's Justin Verlander pitched the first of his three gems on June 12, 2007. It's the fourth time the Brewers have been no-hit.

WASHINGTON (Gray DC) - It has been 19 years since September 11 attacks on this country that left thousands dead and first responders feeling the impact to this day. A new crowdfunding site labels itself as a way to exclusively support families of all first responders facing hard times. For Skip and Tammy Danielson, Fund the First is a way to heal financially as their hearts continue to ache.“He went in immediately to the triage area at the hospital, collapsed, and they worked on him for five hours,” said Skip.Skip recalls the tragic day his son Scott died. Scott was the chief of an emergency squad in New Jersey, responding to the scene of a crash. He found out his daughter Alycia was involved in the crash. After following Alycia’s ambulance to the hospital, he realized he needed help. Alycia survived, but Scott died of a heart attack.“The kids, though they’re adults now, you know, are still having all kinds of issues, still having nightmares,” said Tammy Danielson, Scott’s wife.The lingering impact of Danielson’s death hit the family’s finances. Tammy is entitled to workmen’s compensation, but says an insurance company is appealing her case, leaving her bank account in limbo. Tammy turned to Fund the First. Her campaign is just a month old and she has raised over five thousand dollars.“It’s, you know, specific for first responders, and a lot of times they get overlooked,” said Tammy.A Fund the First spokesperson says there are more than 40 campaigns up and running on the crowdfunding site that have raised over $185,000. The site includes campaigns from Hurricane Laura responders to those who served on 9/11.“We want our contributors to know this is the only authorized place to raise money during their time of need,” said Robert Garland, founder and CEO of Fund the First.He says he started the company for his partner, whose sick daughter was racking up expensive medical bills. Garland says he found too many crowdfunding sites are unverified and vulnerable to fraud.He says his site has a rigorous verification process, forcing those starting a campaign to verify their identification multiple times. Garland says this ensures every dollar is guaranteed to go to first responder’s family.“Ensuring security and trust for our fellow first responders to host their campaigns during their time of need without having to worry about someone stealing their campaign,” said Garland.Money will not bring Scott back to the Danielson family, but Skip says this fund can at least ease some of the financial pain.“It’s been tough on all of us, but obviously it’s been toughest on (Tammy),” said Skip.Scott Danielson died at the age of 49.Copyright 2020 Gray DC.

Her greatest memory from the adventure - were the rainbows that laid just beyond the horizon. "There were spectacular end-to-end rainbows of fantastical color… just complete arcing rainbows when I needed it the most. It was like sending someone a hug in the middle of the ocean - I loved it." Ditton said these almost-spiritual moments intensified when the rainbows would appear at sunset, right after an evening rain. The rich blue of the Pacific was another sight that she found hard to tire of. "I can see why survivors of abandoned ships at sea often end up believing in God at the end. There’s a very strong power that’s very visible in nature. And when you’re immersed in it without frontiers like in the ocean, it’s hard not to wonder," she mused.
