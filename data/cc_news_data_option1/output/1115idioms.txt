In terms of the gross margin and how we think about it going forward, I think right now we're in the middle of our long-term non-GAAP gross margin projections and I anticipate that we're going to stay within that band. And in the long term we see us going over that 80%-plus from the standpoint of a non- GAAP gross margin basis. So we're going to continue to do those things that we've been doing well. On the optimization side, we're going to continue to bring in new modules into our platform. Those two things combined will lead us to where we want to go.

Hey, Sterling. Thanks. So just to reiterate, we do believe that we've probably derisked our guidance, but as we know, it's a fluid situation. We believe our guidance is appropriately prudent based on what we know today, including coronavirus. As of today, we haven't seen a change in our ability to close business. Our pipeline is at record levels. We've talked to our sales leaders and the theaters and we like where we're at. But we want to be prudent in light of the current macro situation and out of abundance of caution, we derisked our guidance.

While we are unable to predict what will happen in the macroeconomy, we believe these elements and the fact that security is mission critical to organizations, gives us significant advantages in any environment. We are aligning our resources to reach customers in light of the current environment which includes shifting marketing investment more toward our digital channel for the near term. Additionally, Mike Carpenter, CrowdStrike's President of Global Sales and Field Operations and I are kicking off a new 100 by 100 international tour where we will meet with 100 of our customers and prospects in 100 days all remotely via Zoom. It is our view that during times like this the best companies continue to innovate, focus on customer success and emerge stronger than ever before. And when we look past the short term, we believe the powerful combination of our cloud native platform and frictionless go-to- market engine, which includes trial-to-pay and in-app trial offerings as well as emerging channels such as AWS Marketplace position us well as the fundamental endpoint platform of the future. We will continue to focus on driving customer success and expanding our lead over the competition.

Thanks, Alex. First of all comment on your question about share. So basically, for valuation purposes I would use 233 million shares. With respect to the sales heads, we're continuing to invest for sure. Yeah, in this environment there is going to be more that's going to be available in the group that we look at to hire from. So we're going to obviously take advantage of that and take advantage of the current landscape. But having said all that, again I want to go back to the point that I've been making all along, which is we're going to be investing prudently. We're going to continue our strong unit economics, we're not going to do anything that's unnatural. And so I think that with the model in place the competitive landscape, I think we're in good spot to continue to go after sales reps. With that, I'll turn it over to George.

Okay, great. Well, thanks, Alex. And I think when we look at security in general, we have to put it in perspective, it is mission critical and in the corporate hierarchy of needs cyber security is equivalent of shelter, it's fundamental, it's a basic need and you can't live without it. And obviously there is going to be industries that are more impacted than others, but at the end of the day they're going to need security. It's a compliance mandate for many, many large companies even not large companies right from a data privacy perspective, whether it's a state or federal government or any other government around the globe. And they're going to still need to be able to purchase that. I think again when they come to CrowdStrike, a big part of what we do is we help them consolidate what they have. We can show them that three times or better return on their investment. And in today's environment obviously where there is going to be tremendous cost pressure on these companies, I think we're the perfect solution to help optimize their head count, help optimize their spend on hardware and software and security and people and putting all that together, it's a very compelling offering that we have for them in a time of need.

Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, first off, congrats on a really strong quarter here. George, you alluded to a shift in demand here for Falcon Complete. I think in the face of all that's happened over the past few weeks, how do you think about the nature of the conversation around Complete today, especially within the large enterprise?

And in some of the earnings calls this one and some of the prior ones I've talked about the consolidation, five, six, seven different technologies we've been able to consolidate out. Things like Spotlight, we have new release come out at the end of Q4, broader coverage and we've seen the adoption pick up very rapidly in that module and customers really liking it. So whether it's that, Falcon X, across the board, I mean we have strong module adoption. I continue to come back to Discover and Spotlight though. These are real two gems that the IT team can leverage. Tell me what the patch, here you go, and help me automate my systems with Discover, it's a great one-two combination.

With millions of face masks, low interest loans and teams of medical experts, China is trying to paint itself as a Good Samaritan while deflecting criticism over its initial missteps in handling the coronavirus.
 Beijing has showered struggling European nations with aid as part of a diplomatic charm offensive.
 In recent weeks, it has also donated hundreds of thousands of surgical masks and test kits to the Philippines and Pakistan, sent teams of medics to Iran and Iraq, and extended a $500 million loan to help Sri Lanka combat the virus.
 While COVID-19 first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December, Beijing says it has now curbed its spread, with domestic cases dwindling to zero Thursday.
 But as other governments now scramble to cope with the pandemic, China is sending masks, medical supplies and experts.
 President Xi Jinping pledged assistance to hardest-hit Italy and Spain in phone calls with their prime ministers, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
 Two Chinese medical teams were sent to Italy in a high-profile show of solidarity with the earliest European Union partner in Xi's massive "Belt and Road" infrastructure project.
 Italy is now the second hardest-hit country in the world with more than 35,000 cases.
 EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Twitter this week that China would ship two million masks to Europe "immediately" and expressed her gratitude to Premier Li Keqiang.
 She said the EU helped China in January, by donating equipment, and tweeted: "Today, we're grateful for China's support."
 Beijing also sent medical equipment to Serbia this week after an appeal for help.
 "It has turned out that without you Europe can hardly defend itself," Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic told Beijing's ambassador as Chinese virus tests arrived.
 He said the country had been waiting for its "Chinese brothers".
 The EU -- of which Serbia is not a member -- announced a ban on the export of medical equipment on Sunday, a move slammed by Vucic.
 Xinhua said more aid and doctors from China would arrive in Serbia in the next few days.
 Beijing has in recent years challenged Brussels for influence in the Balkans, in particular through heavy loan-based infrastructure investment in cash- strapped countries.
 Other political allies which China has supported or supplied include a number of African nations.
 Meanwhile Jack Ma, China's richest man, donated two million masks to be distributed across Europe, with shipments having arrived in Belgium, Spain and Italy.
 Another million masks bound for France left China on Wednesday.
 \- China-US tensions -
 A front-page commentary by the state-run People's Daily on Thursday emphasised China's role as a "responsible major country" that willingly cooperates with other nations.
 It comes as Beijing and Washington are engaged in a tit-for-tat public opinion war over China's recent mass expulsion of US journalists and President Donald Trump's continued use of the phrase "Chinese virus" to describe the coronavirus.
 With the US also battling the virus on its home turf, analysts say China is rushing to reposition itself as an alternative global leader.
 "Now, with the US government under Trump failing to provide any meaningful international response and the EU occupied with national responses, it offers China's government a unique opportunity to step into the empty spot," said Marina Rudyak, an expert in Chinese foreign aid at the University of Heidelberg.
 By doing so, China was also trying to rewrite the COVID-19 narrative, deflecting criticism of its initial attempts to cover up the outbreak and posing as the saviour of "other countries who either delayed their response or were less prepared than China," added Rudyak.
 For some European countries, the strategy appears to be working.
 "There are competing narratives evolving in Europe. Most people see China being responsible for this global crisis," said Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.
 "But the generous humanitarian help from China will possibly swing the public opinion in Europe more in favour of China."

One is hoping that we'll one day look back on these days and laugh at the antics of those that were scrambling so madly to try and survive the pandemic that's already seen a pretty high survival rate, even among those that are most at-risk, but with a healthy dose of respect for those that will not have made the trip with us. Keeping a sense of humor during these times is highly important since it's bound to be one of the many things that will keep humanity moving forward in the days to come. Being able to laugh, live, and get along without feeling the need to break each other down and continually spell out the doom and gloom that is befalling the species is important since it falls to us to be the harbingers of our own rise even as those among us speak long and loudly of our coming demise. The more we continue to live, the more we continue to stare our coming doom in the face and say 'bring it on', the more we will make it clear that fate will do what it wants and deal with us accordingly. To some that's an irresponsible and very dangerous way to exist, but upon speaking to our elderly and thinking of what our ancestors might say it's easy to think that we might find ourselves on the receiving end of a Gibbs slap as they would tell us of the days when they had diseases that are considered minor and could kill wide swaths of people due to lack of proper medical procedures. They might even laugh to think that with our technological advances that any disease would prove too tough to stand against, when they fought for the right to survive some of the worst diseases of their own time. The point is, worrying continually about the virus is not a cure, nor is it bound to do anything but make life worse. Live, laugh, and respect the situation for what is. But above all, don't stop living. Chris Murphy of Vulture can attest to this.

Now let's discuss our results and get into these topics in more detail. Across the board, we delivered another exceptional quarter at CrowdStrike with record results well exceeding our expectations. During the quarter we added a record $99 million in net new ARR and year-over-year, we increased the number of net new subscription customers by 116%, achieving 90% subscription revenue growth and 89% total revenue growth, which was above the high end of our guidance. The fourth quarter topped off a historic year for CrowdStrike in which we delivered exceptional growth at scale, significantly improved our margins and achieved positive free cash flow for the year.

Well thanks, Gregg. I think it's both. Again, as I said in the past what we've seen is a compression of someone who may be out a year in terms of renewal and now coming to [indiscernible]. In many cases they've been hit with some ransom or something that really has accelerated while they're coming to us. In other cases, they've just not happy with support. They're not on the named list and they basically have come to us and said, okay, maybe we'll run out one part of the Symantec license, but we're going to pick some pieces of your suit up, we'll get that up and running now. And then when these things start to run out, we'll ultimately just move everything over to you. So it -- Gregg, it's really a little bit of both.

The fact that this video is set to the Jurassic Park music is pretty comical, but that's kind of where comedy takes a backseat since if Americans think we have it bad at this moment then they need to be reminded that in Italy there is an official lockdown that keeps people from being on the streets or gathering at all. Emma Taylor of Insider has more on this story. We don't have it that bad here. Yes things are shutting down and parts of our everyday lives are being disrupted with social distancing and the need to stay at home and be with our kids and family for the safety of others. BUT WE'RE NOT ON LOCKDOWN. Folks need to get this through their heads, things are not as bad here as they could be, and those that are promising, or predicting, that things are only going to get worse need to seriously unclench their butt cheeks and realize that the world is not bound to end by disease. It's unfortunate and tragic that people are dying because of COVID-19, there's no other way to say it and there's no positive spin to put on the fact that thousands have died worldwide because of the disease. But acting the part of the doomsayer isn't helping anyone since all it does is scare the living hell out of a populace that's already on edge and ready to rebel at any given moment for matters far less dire than this disease.

And the answer is yes. We've got a great partnership with AWS. It cuts the sales cycle down when we use the AWS marketplace by almost 50%. And just a quick step add from an ARR perspective, just in Q1 we were up 32% quarter- over-quarter with our AWS marketplace deal. So it's been an amazing channel for us. And at the end of the day, I think people as they are remote, as procurement is not around, it's a great channel for them. The terms are pretty much negotiated. You can get a deal done very quickly and it slots right in into their overall environment. And by the way they can buy it and still use it on their on-prem environment, doesn't have to be used just in the AWS cloud. So it's been really a great channel for us.

Family members on both sides of Claire’s family tree live with type 1 diabetes. “We just grew up with type 1 [diabetes] in our family,” Correne says. At family gatherings, everyone knows what to do if someone with the disease has an episode of dangerously low blood glucose (sugar). For Correne, a pediatrician, type 1 diabetes also affects her professional life: she diagnoses patients with the disease in her own practice. One New Year’s Day, she even noticed that a visiting family member was abnormally thirsty at breakfast—an observation that led to a type 1 diabetes diagnosis. “Type 1 diabetes is so personal for our family because it just has had a huge impact on our lives,” Correne says.

Obviously, with COVID-19 it's a serious situation for them. And at the same time, they still need to keep just running. And I think one of the big drivers that we've seen is ransomware. There is so many small businesses that have been just obliterated by ransomware as they continue to use traditional signature based AV. So I think we've been very successful in helping companies migrate away from that and deal with that problem at the same time now they're struggling with just keeping open. And I think as a company we've done a good job in helping organizations, see the value and basically provide the outcome they are looking for, keep up and running, not have to worry about security. In many cases, they don't actually have the personnel to deal with it and with our Falcon Complete, it's been an absolute home run in the SMB in the corporate market because we're able to deal with kind of human issue for them as a force multiplier. So we continue to invest there.
