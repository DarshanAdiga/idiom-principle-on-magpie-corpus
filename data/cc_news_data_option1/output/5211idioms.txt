The importance of this game on a Big Ten level doesn’t come close to last year’s tilt when the winner grabbed the West Division championship and went to the title game. But you can be sure both sides are still very excited for the 130th meeting between the two rivals. The bragging rights that come with it are huge for the two schools and their fan bases.

Congratulations and thanks to Darwin Longfellow, as well as to each and every healthcare worker who fights so hard to take care of all of us every single day. Your compassion, empathy, and dedication to caring for people are completely out of this world. As far as I’m concerned, all of you should get a shiny new motorcycle, at the very least. Unfortunately, that’s not something I have any power to do—but you definitely deserve it.

The top Aussies can train and move around Melbourne with freedom while international stars deal with the harshest quarantine they have faced since the tour resumed.The challenge for Barty and Kyrgios will be to ensure they are match hardened to fire from the opening day of February when Melbourne will host four tournaments in a week.The goal is to end a local drought for Australian players dating back to Chris O’Neil’s success in 1978 and Mark Edmondson’s bolt from the blue two years earlier. It is far from easy. Lleyton Hewitt reached a final in 2005. Pat Rafter was a semi-finalist in 2001. And Barty reached the last four for the first time in Melbourne in January when edged by eventual champion Sofia Kenin.The world No 1 has not played since reaching the semifinals of a tournament in Qatar in February, having placed an emphasis on protecting the health of herself and team through the pandemic.Kyrgios dazzled on and off the court in January, showing signs of maturity and a willingness to embrace responsibility, with his fundraising feats for bushfire victims widely applauded.But the Canberran, who performed well in the ATP Cup and reached the last 16 of the Australian Open, has not played since retiring from a match in Mexico in late February. The 2021 Australian Open will be going ahead on February 8 in Melbourne with international stars to enter hotel quarantine under special conditions. Expect both to be hungry to succeed, feeling as fresh as they have felt in years and ready to hit the ground running.Their preparations are well underway. Barty has been on court in Brisbane with coach Craig Tyzzer since the week leading into the AFL grand final played at the Gabba.Kyrgios will be a member of the Australian team competing in an abridged version of the ATP Cup featuring 12 teams instead of the 24 which featured in the inaugural event.Australia’s top ranked man, Alex de Minaur, who is still with his family in Spain, will be among those who have to quarantine. Expect Barty, the 2019 French Open champion, and Kyrgios, a dual-grand slam quarterfinalist, to be playing dozens of sets in practice when preparing for the three-week local season.There is a prospect they will also be able to engage in some regular match play leading into the first week of February, where Barty will be top seed in one of the two WTA Tour tournaments.Over the past six months Tennis Australia has hosted Universal Tennis Rating round-robin tournaments along the eastern seaboard and in Adelaide. The purses have been small by tour standards. But they have served players such as Daria Gavrilova and Thanasi Kokkinakis well, with both enjoying success on the comeback trail from injury. Sam Stosur also played an event in Melbourne, while Bernard Tomic is through to a final in Brisbane this week as he, too, attempts a bid to return from the tennis rankings wilderness.To date, though, the established WTA and ATP Tour regulars led by Barty and including Kyrgios, Millman and Jordan Thompson have opted against competing, with the latter rejoining competitive ranks in August.But with the Australian summer looming, that may well change. During the initial lockdown, local officials raised the prospect of holding an Australian Closed Championships prior to the tour resuming in August. With a wildcard playoff almost certainly out of question – it is expected the lucky Australian players to earn wildcards for the 2021 Australian Open will be told the good news soon – it would not surprise if the option for a closed championships is under strong consideration.

The MT-09 was an immediate attention-getter when it burst onto the scene in 2014. The middleweight naked didn’t turn heads with its looks, however, it did so with its sound. Thanks to its crossplane crankshaft, the 12-valve inline- three powerplant delivered a throaty exhaust note that sent moto enthusiasts into a frenzy. Nowadays, it's hard to find a modern parallel-twin without a 270-degree crankshaft, due in part to the success of the MT-09 and its smaller sibling MT-07.

Could this also be the week that running back Julius Davis sees his first action? With Berger sidelined, the redshirt freshman traveled for the first time with the team as it went to Iowa. But instead of him getting reps, running back coach John Settle turned to walk-on Brady Schipper as his third back. It’s worth noting that Wisconsin didn't know Berger wouldn't be able to play until Friday morning, so it’s possible they didn’t feel comfortable in getting Davis up to speed and involved on short notice. Perhaps with a full week of prep he could see the field.

By then, snow was falling fast and furious, with conditions continuing to deteriorate as heavy bands of snow pivoted in from the northwest. Impressive snowfall rates, likely topping two inches an hour, accompanied the most fierce bands.
 The episode was caused by "ocean-effect snow," similar in dynamics to lake- effect precipitation that frequents the shores of the Great Lakes. A frigid air mass blowing from the northwest over much warmer waters, in this case between 55 and 60 degrees, allowed heat and moisture from the Sea of Japan to be transported inland in the form of heavy snow.
 Japan's high terrain helped focus moisture, too, concentrating it on the upslope, or windward side of the mountains. That meant snow could fall for days at a time unimpeded, the wintry blast maintained so long as the wind fetch remained from the northwest.
 Japan's climate routinely favors hefty snowfall in the mountains. Arctic wintertime cold fronts from Siberia surge south across northeast China and the Korean Peninsula, arriving in Japan after passing over the adjacent sea. The Sea of Japan is kept mild by the Kuroshio Current, akin to the Gulf Stream; a branch of it, called the Tshushima Current, meanders west of the Japanese island chain.
 At least 600 vehicles remained stuck much of Friday, according to Japanese broadcaster NHK News; they were all freed by late Friday local time.
 Meanwhile, an additional 15 to 30 inches of snow could be on the way for hard- hit areas finally beginning to dig out as the ocean effect kicks in once again this weekend. The Japanese Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for heavy snow and avalanche advisories, anticipating an additional "traffic hindrance due to snowfall."
