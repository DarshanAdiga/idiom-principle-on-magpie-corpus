Il sostegno alle persone in difficoltà arriva anche in tempo di emergenza a sanitaria. Per garantire i servizi di trasporto a tutte le persone fragili, anziani, bambini e disabili si è tenuta giovedì 17 Settembre la cerimonia, con tanto di taglio del nastro, per l’inaugurazione del nuovo mezzo di trasporto per i cittadini di Pistoia. In questa occasione i “Progetti del Cuore”, avviati da qualche tempo sul nostro comune, rendono disponibile da oggi un nuovo mezzo di trasporto per le persone anziane e diversamente abili per garantire ai cittadini il servizio di trasporto sociale gratuito per una durata di due anni, durante i quali il servizio sarà garantito e gestito in maniera integrale: dall’allestimento del mezzo per il trasporto disabili, alla gestione delle spese (come ad esempio l’assicurazione compresa di copertura kasko). L’importanza e l’urgenza di questo progetto nascono dalle sempre crescenti necessità del territorio, soprattutto in questo periodo di emergenza, in cui molte associazioni si sono occupate di sostegno alle persone fragili anziani, bambini e disabili. Quest’anno a ricevere il mezzo sarà il Samaritano Onlus, che avrà a disposizione un Fiat Doblò attrezzato per il trasporto dei cittadini diversamente abili e in stato di necessità. Da sempre il Samaritano si occupa di aiutare le persone in difficoltà del territorio, come anziani, disabili o malati che ogni giorno hanno bisogno di assistenza. Il progetto è stato presentato giovedì 17 Settembre presso c/o Il Samaritano via dei canestrai 1 Codogno. All’inaugurazione, per festeggiare l’arrivo del mezzo, erano presenti il Consiglio direttivo del Samaritano ed una rappresentativa del gruppo di volontari autisti che materialmente utilizzano il mezzo, oltre che le famiglie di tutti coloro che potranno usufruire del trasporto verso case di cura, o per le uscite diurne .

These attributes have further enabled drugs derived from peptides in targeting diseases with more precision and fewer side effects compared to small-molecule drugs. Peptides are becoming the future of medical research and drug development in light of their selectiveness, higher potency, and more safety. This will further rub off on the development and demand for egg white peptides in the forthcoming years.

Look at how the city has dealt with the homeless situation and in punishing the residents and tourists who they so desperately desire in downtown. Business and people in restaurants were offended by the loitering and looking in at people eating that they removed all the park benches in the Market and to add insult to injury then made it a fine to sit on the tables.
 We are this kind of community because of our lack of intelligent leadership in our fair city over the decades.

Something happened more recently that highlighted the hypocrisy in the cancel culture movement. In my own backyard in the Philadelphia suburbs, Darby Township Commissioner Marvin Smith posted a meme on his social media page that depicted a white police officer trapped between two Black men. The Black men held pistols to his head. The caption read: “Does it have to come to this to make them stop murdering and terrorizing us?”

It is difficult to give weight to any of Mr. Thornton’s comments in knowing how much he or anyone else would be rewarded in the redevelopment of Campbell Court. I praise and thank him for all the positive things he has done to improve our city, but I’m having problems, even trying to write this, in that there are just so many integrated problems and issues in the project that is a major challenge for any city the size of Roanoke to have to grapple with.
