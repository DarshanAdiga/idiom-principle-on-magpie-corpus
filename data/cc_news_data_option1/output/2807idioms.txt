Stagecoach has worked with @hartyyy to create a tutorial to show audiences how best to do their makeup so that it stays on while taking your face covering on and off. In the video, Lucy Hart, a Manchester-based influencer and head artist at the Gypsie Shrine, does her makeup and then travels on a Stagecoach bus to Manchester to meet up with a friend. The video contains hints and tips on how to ensure your foundation and lipstick doesn’t smear over your face covering and stays in tact during a long day of shopping, eating and drinking.
 Catherine Acton-Brazier, Regional Director North for Stagecoach, said “We know that people will want to look their best though, particularly for that important first selfie in the bar, coffee shop or shop, and with face coverings now becoming part of our normal everyday life, we wanted to give people a helping hand with that.

Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr
 By Olga Cotaga
 LONDON, July 17 (Reuters) - Long-term Italian government bond yields hovered around their lowest in months on Friday, the first day of a European Union summit during which member states are expected to vote on a 750 billion euro recovery fund.
 Opinions on the possible outcomes of the summit - likely known during the weekend - range from a deal being agreed close to what was proposed to no agreement, with a follow-up meeting at a later date.
 ING analysts believe that some progress will be made this weekend, but that the final agreement will take place later, envisaging a compromise around a 600 billion euro package split in equal part between grants and loans.
 Some wealthier northern European countries are against providing the money via grants.
 Nonetheless, such an outcome would likely shrink the premium Italy has to pay to bond-holders, ING analysts said.
 "We're expecting progress but, save for a few smaller countries, the benefit should fall short of a game changer. Still, the way is clear for further spread tightening," they wrote in a note to clients.
 "In numbers, a swift agreement would push 10-year German-Italian yield spread towards our 150 basis point target by the end of the summer," they said.
 The Bund-BTP spread - the premium Italy pays over safe-haven German Bund yields - was last at 170 bps, close to the lower end of the trading range this year.
 Italian 10-year yields were last up 1.1 bps at 1.25% , hovering around the 16-week low it fell to the day before, when the ECB reassured markets it would most likely use the full firepower of emergency bond purchases to tackle the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
 German 10-year yields were steady at -0.46%.
 The summit will stretch well into the weekend. ING analysts said they were not expecting much by way of soundbites during the Friday session, advising against acting on them.

CARVER - School officials are working on a re-entry plan to prepare for an in- person return to school while meeting health and safety requirements, remote learning in two parts and a hybrid of the two.
 Superintendent Scott Knief said in a presentation to the School Committee last week that the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wants school districts to submit one formal plan by July 31.
 "We're always adjusting to new information," he said, as he shared an outline of a reopening plan that he has also shared with the faculty of both Carver schools and also at a parent meeting attended by as many as 130 parents.
 He said so many parents wanted to be part of the process that he established a parent advisory subcommittee to meet on a weekly basis.
 The School Committee has committed to meeting at 7 p.m. Wednesday, July 29, through remote participation via Zoom to focus on reviewing the final re-entry plan to be presented to the state and making any final suggestions that could result in changes.
 Parents recently answered a survey about having their students return to school with health and safety requirements in place. He said he was not surprised by the results.
 Knief said of the 628 total responses, 68 percent said their students would return in the fall, 5 percent said no and 27 percent said they were unsure with not enough information or they don't know where they will be in six weeks.
 Eighty percent responded that they do not have health concerns in their family that would keep their students at home, and of the 20 percent who do, some would still send their students back.
 As for the hybrid option, Knief said one option is students returning to school half days every day, alternating days, two days in-person and three days remotely and then alternating weeks. He said half days every day was a first choice but ranked lower for another option.
 School Committee member Jenn Pratt said that as a parent she would prefer alternating weeks and knows teachers who also prefer that to half days based on the amount of quality teaching time balanced against maintaining sanitary conditions. Knief said it will be a priority to keep students in the same family on the same schedule.
 Knief expects to ask parents to a respond to a few more surveys, with the final survey asking parents to formally commit to sending their students back to school or providing them with a remote learning opportunity.
 "Right now we're thinking that this kind of model would be some sort of an online learning platform," he said.
 School Committee member Jason Greenwood was concerned about how the district will reach out to parents about the reopening plan. Knief said he hopes to schedule public hearing-type meetings for that purpose.
 Both schools will be required to have isolation rooms for students or staff with possible COVID-19 symptoms that are separate from the nurse's offices but that school nurses can access using the appropriate personal protective equipment.
 Knief said Carver Elementary has the available space and a new state-of-the- art ventilation system, but that's not the case at Carver Middle High School.
 School Committee member James O'Brien said not enough consideration is being given to the difficulties of talking with a mask on all day and he would support face shields as an option. He also worries about how students will catch up academically among the other challenges.
 "There are a lot of people really having a hard time with this," he said.
 One of the recommendations is that students eat in their classrooms. Knief said yes when School Committee Chairman Andy Cardarelli asked about opening windows and holding classes outdoors weather permitting as plausible options.
 Knief said efforts are underway to be able to meet social distancing requirements of at least three feet apart and all students facing forward, including purchasing new desks for kindergarten and first grade rather than sharing tables.
 He said that cost of the new desks and the remote learning platform for students who do not return to school may be covered by new funding announced by Gov. Charlie Baker. He said school districts will receive an additional $225 per pupil. He said that would mean approximately $360,000 for Carver.

The company’s most recent reporting period (until March 31st) including half a month or a month of disruption showed a 14.5% year-on-year decline in revenue, while net income took a far greater hit falling more than 67% year on year. The consensus EPS for Q1 was 33 cents; this was already revised down by more than 70% in the month prior to the earnings release. Planet Fitness actually delivered earnings of just 16 cents. More than 50% below the revised consensus. This also spelled the first miss on EPS since the company was listed back in 2015.
 Looking ahead for full year 2020 results, consensus forecasts suggest an EPS figure of 66 cents a share following the miss in Q1. This puts Planet Fitness on a forward-looking P/E ratio of around 90 which seems unsupportable. A P/E of 60 which would indicate investors looking through the crisis and pricing on earnings in 2021 and beyond would indicate a share price of around $40 could be seen later this year.
 ## Long-term concerns
 I would raise a couple of longer-term concerns as well. Firstly, the valuation of a growth stock like Planet Fitness prices in the possibility of continued expansion and how realistic is that assumption? At over 2,000 sites, Planet Fitness is already one of the largest gym chains in North America, alongside Anytime Fitness with over 2,000 sites, Snap Fitness with 1,500 plus, Orangetheory Fitness with 1,200 plus and several others with hundreds of sites. As the gym chains expand, they struggle to find the perfect ‘bullseye’ location and subsequent locations in a physical expansion model may be less and less optimal, affecting future earnings per site. The answer for Planet Fitness may be overseas expansion but this has so far been a very minor part of their expansion plan with sites in Canada and the Dominican Republic compared to a brand such as Anytime Fitness which operates over 4,000 gyms globally in 50 countries.
 The crisis also means that Planet Fitness may be facing a number of new competitors on different fronts. The likes of Peloton (PTON) have seen tremendous growth over the lockdown as more people have looked to their services for working out. While this may not materially affect Planet Fitness in the short run, it may display to people the viability of working out from home instead of having to go to the gym. While companies such as ClassPass will continue to develop and introduce more people to studio fitness potentially undermining Planet Fitness's model.

Arteta strikes me as an intelligent, astute individual who plays the diplomatic role when appropriate but who can be blunt to get his message across.Realistically the next two seasons are likely to be difficult for Arsenal.On a positive note the end of next season will see the departure of a number of mediocre players in the shape of Mustafi, Sokratis, Luis and last, but not least, the highly overpaid Mesut Ozil.Bringing in upgrades for these guys should not be difficult, but it's a question of blending them into a team which can once again challenge for honours.That is the difficult challenge for Arteta and his support team.I wish them all the best.

Opening gala of the 22nd Shanghai International Film Festival Photo: Yang Hui/GT
    The long-awaited 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF) will kick off on July 25 and run until August 2, SIFF announced on Friday. The 26th Shanghai TV Festival will be held between August 3 and 7. The events, which were postponed due to COVID-19, will be the first major international film and television festivals to be held in China since the outbreak began.      However, it is still undecided whether the audiences will be able to attend the opening ceremony and star-studded red carpet this year. The events will involve both offline and online activities, including screenings in cinemas, outdoor spaces and on online platforms, themed forums and TV awards, as well as promotional and investment activities.      SIFF's screening schedule will be released on Saturday, according to the announcement. Audiences will be able to buy tickets on Chinese ticket platform Taopiaopiao from July 20. There will be no offline ticket sales this year.      Audience attendance rates per screening will not exceed 30 percent, according to the SIFF announcement.      The good news came after the China Film Administration announced on Thursday that cinemas in low-risk areas across the country could reopen as early as July 20, having been closed for nearly six months.      Real-time searches for "cinema" on Chinese search engine Baidu surged 1,011 percent within an hour of the announcement.      Despite strict virus control requirements, the reopening of cinemas and the return of SIFF have cheered Chinese movie lovers. Many expect new movies will be released in cinemas, and many have posted their expected movie lists online, ranging from domestically made movies to overseas works like Zhong Guo Nv Pai or the Iron Hammer, Detective China Town, Master Jiang and The Six Kingdoms, Interstellar, Train to Busan, Black Widow and Mulan.      Mulan, the mega-budget Disney live action film starring Chinese actress Liu Yifei, is popular on such lists. The film's release has been delayed twice because of the COVID-19 pandemic.      "My happiness is back! Get prepared with masks, I am coming, Mulan," one netizen said.      However, some still worry that audiences will need to wait longer to watch movies that are over two hours long, as authorities will require each screening to not exceed two hours to prevent coronavirus transmission.      Daily screening schedules need to be reduced to half their normal number, the total number of viewers in each screening will be limited to 30 percent of the venue's capacity, and groups need to sit one meter apart from each other.      He Yue, a film enthusiast living in Shanghai, hopes there will be more screening sessions arranged during the festival to satisfy the demand of movie-goers who have been stuck at home for so long, considering the above limitations.      He told the Global Times that tickets during the SIFF sell like hot cakes every year. "They are sold out in seconds," He said, predicting that it may be even harder this year to get tickets due to the strict virus control measures.      Due to the threat of the coronavirus, many film events this year like the renowned 73rd Cannes International Film Festival and the Telluride Film Festival have been postponed or canceled.      "The cinemas are opening and the film festival is returning, everything is getting better," a netizen commented.

The order covers ships that can carry 250 or more passengers. The CDC said cruise ships are more crowded than most urban settings, and even when only essential crew remains on board, the virus continues to spread. Companies that belong to an industry trade group, the Cruise Lines International Association, had already canceled cruises until Sept. 15 because of ongoing discussions with federal officials over how to restart operations safely. Members of the group include Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings. From March 1 through July 10, there have been nearly 3,000 cases of COVID-19 or similar illnesses and 34 deaths on cruise ships, according to the CDC. There have been 99 outbreaks covering 80% of the ships in US waters, the CDC said. Nine ships are still dealing with outbreaks, the agency said.

Ericsson and Finland's Nokia are expected to benefit from Britain's decision this week to ban Chinese supplier Huawei from next-generation 5G networks.
 Sales in Ericsson's mainstay network business grew 4per cent in the second quarter, mostly due to contract wins in China. It won a share of 5G business - alongside Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE - from the country's three largest telecom operators: China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom.
 The company's shares were up 10per cent at 0818 GMT
