A pair of cruise ships carrying more than 200 guests and crew with flu-like symptoms will be allowed to dock in Florida's Port of Everglades Thursday, ending a nightmarish voyage disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
 A conditional agreement between the cruise line and local authorities will allow healthy passengers to go home while the sick remain on board for treatment, Broward County Commissioner Barbara Sharief said Thursday.
 After days of uncertainty over their final destination, the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships were to have passengers disembark about 1 p.m. at the Fort Lauderdale port, according to Sharief.

The Zaandam's South American itinerary changed dramatically when nine passengers tested positive for Covid-19 and four men died on board. Sharief said the men were over the age of 70 -- two had been diagnosed with Covid-19, one suffered a heart attack and another succumbed to a preexisting illness.
 No one on board is in need of a hospital bed at this time but local beds are available, Sharief said.
 Holland America said late Wednesday that it had secured a local health system to treat the fewer than 10 people in need of immediate critical care onshore. The Broward Health Hospital System confirmed Thursday that critically ill patients from the Zaandam would be transferred there, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Smith.
 "Prepare to disembark" was the long-awaited, reassuring message delivered to passengers by the captain of the Rotterdam, the Zaandam's sister ship, on Thursday morning, according to passenger Laura Gabaroni.
 Healthy passengers with permission to travel home will be transported by private bus from Port Everglades to local airports for charter flights, Sharief said. Some 200 passengers hail from countries requiring connecting flights to get home. Passengers will will be taken directly to flights to avoid possible spread of the virus.
 Passengers on the Zaandam include 311 US citizens from 46 states, including 52 Floridians. Broward residents among them have agreed to isolate for an additional 14 days at home. The rest from from countries ranging from Canada to the UK to Australia.
 On Wednesday night, the British-American cruise line called the plight of those on board a "humanitarian situation." It made a last-ditch appeal to federal and local authorities to allow the cruise ships to disembark in the Port of Everglades.
 "Holland America Line calls for compassion and reason in the review and approval of our disembarkation plan by Florida officials," the cruise line said in a statement.
 The appeal came hours after Gov. Ron DeSantis said his state was willing to accept Floridians on board the cruise ships.

Apex Legends: The Old Ways is a new event starring the tracker Bloodhound, and it's right around the corner.
 The event will kick off next week on Tuesday, April 7 and continue through Tuesday, April 21. During that time, players will have access to a new Town Takeover on the World's Edge map. The Bloodhound's Trials Takeover will appear in the northwest corner of the map and spawn a whole mess of Prowlers. If you can defeat them as well as the other Legends that come looking, you'll earn some high-tier loot.
 The Old Ways will also introduce some permanent changes to Apex Legends. Beginning April 7, the duo playlist will become a permanent addition, though solos remains a temporary mode. Not only that, both the duo and trio playlists will gain permanent map rotation which lets players choose between World's Edge and good-old King's Canyon. King's Canyon was recently reintroduced for competitive play, but _many players - including our own Alyssa Mercante - weren't thrilled with it_, so it's nice that players get to choose their map now.
 As with all events, The Old Ways will also add a selection of exclusive premium cosmetics, including the return of the original eight Legendary Hunt skins. These skins will be available for direct purchase - no more loot box hell - alongside others, like alternate skins for Wraith and the R-301 rifle, which were previously exclusive to the battle pass. You can check out these skins and see more of The Old Ways on its _newly minted page_ on EA's site.

All funds will be distributed for COVID-19 relief, with no administrative fees. Funds will be released on a rolling basis throughout the outbreak and recovery phases of the crisis.
 “The community foundation believes coordination is vital in getting critical resources to our local communities most impacted by the virus,” the foundation’s website states. “We are grateful to our community leaders, partners and nonprofits who are working quickly and collectively to support those most impacted by this pandemic.”
 The fund was launched in mid-March with a $10,000 gift from Eastern Michigan Bank. Other contributors include a $25,000 grant from the DTE Energy Foundation, as well as local donors the Kusch Family Fund, an anonymous donor- advised fund at the Community Foundation and other community members.
 As of March 31, the fund had received about $60,000 in gifts.
 “Next week we’ll begin a new partnership with our local radio stations through the Radio First Broadcasting company to begin some heavy promotions of the fund,” Randy Maiers, president and CEO of the community foundation, said on March 31.
 Maiers said the community foundation has started to make grants from the fund, as well as a related pot of funds totaling over $140,000 that it has set aside to help the region address the COVID-19 outbreak.
 “So, in total, we already have about $200,000 set aside or raised to support our region during this crisis,” he said.
 The community foundation partnered with St. Vincent de Paul and United Way to give a grant to the Food Bank of Eastern Michigan to make four semi-truck deliveries of food to the region, each for $3,300. It also gave $2,000 to Port Huron food bank Mid City Nutrition so it could convert to providing carryout meals.

But some believe provisions protecting consumers could carry more weight in a subsequent round of stimulus.
 “The longer there’s an economic downturn, the greater the window will be for radical legislation,” said Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group. “And I would put interest rate caps in the category of radical policy options. … I think further limits on overdraft fees become possible. I think limits on ATM fees become more possible.”
 To be clear, Democrats were able to provide consumers some relief in the legislation negotiated last week with the Trump administration.
 The bill included a provision to protect consumers’ credit reports if they need to make loan modifications related to the coronavirus. The package provides for up to 180 days of forbearance for borrowers of federally backed mortgage loans, and it prohibits foreclosures on federally backed mortgage loans for 60 days.
 A former senior Senate staffer noted that none of those provisions were included in the stimulus package Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., initially proposed.
 “If you look at the original Treasury proposal for phase three and the original McConnell bill that Senate Republicans developed largely on their own, there wasn’t anything in terms of forbearance or anything,” the former staffer said. “Now, after the Democratic negotiations and the final deal, at least you have what we knew all along were Democratic priorities."
 Still, consumer advocates say the stimulus deal fell short for consumers.
 “The stimulus package did have some important relief for individuals, but it fell far short of what was needed, especially in protecting people’s bank accounts, so that they have funds for food and necessities and making sure that the mortgage and student loan forbearance reach everybody with all types of loans," said Lauren Saunders, associate director at the National Consumer Law Center.
 Consumer advocates note that the provision aimed at protecting consumers’ credit reports wasn’t a complete moratorium on negative credit reporting. That measure requires financial institutions to report modified loan payments as “current” to credit reporting agencies.
 Some note that the bill could have codified industry practice by requiring lenders, when they report a borrower's loan payment information, to include a disclaimer that the borrower was making payments during a disaster event. But in an issue brief, the NCLC said the legislative text “does not require the creditor to report the natural disaster code.”
 “The credit reporting provision ... perhaps makes things worse and does nothing to protect consumers,” said Saunders. “It may be even weaker than the current disaster codes and protocols that the credit bureaus use.”
 The prospect for for added consumer relief really depends on the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, the former Senate staffer said.
 “If it really becomes more dire for individuals, then I could see these kind of measures taking on a little more interest or members of Congress having a little more interest in finding ways to be helpful to consumers,” the former Senate staffer said.
 For one, consumers likely won’t receive the $1,200 relief payments from the government in time to pay their monthly bills.
 “That’s almost a virtual certainty that they’re not going to have this money in a week to 10 days,” the former staffer said.
 Klein said that a proposed temporary ban on overdraft fees would be a particularly useful measure to pass for the duration of the pandemic. Some banks are already offering overdraft relief to consumers. Some credit unions are making similar efforts, including TBA CU in Traverse City, Mich. which has waived those fees through the end of April.
 “I think banks have become too dependent on overdraft fees,” Klein said. “I think bank regulators ought to require banks who participate in special programs to pause overdrafts during the crisis. I think the overdraft proposal is a good proposal. ... The 8% of Americans who pay the $25 billion a year in overdraft fees are the ones that are subsidizing free checking for the rest of us. And the idea that people living paycheck to paycheck pay the most for a basic bank account is morally wrong.”

Portugal's health authorities have ordered French outsourcing firm Teleperformance SE to temporarily shut one of its Lisbon call centers, which remained open after some workers tested positive for coronavirus.
 Lisbon's regional health authority, ARS, said on Thursday it had told the Teleperformance call center at one of Lisbon's busiest avenues, Infante Santo, to suspend all non-essential activities and transfer employees to remote work from home. It recommended that the building be fully disinfected. Call center workers' union SNCC reported five coronavirus cases at the facility but the call centre was still open on Thursday afternoon, according to SNCC representative Manuel Afonso, who also works at Teleperformance. The firm declined to comment.
 "One of the people infected in the Teleperformance building has a pulmonary emphysema and the company was aware of it and didn't send him home in advance," he said. "People were afraid. It was irresponsible to stay open," said SNCC President Danilo Moreira.
 On Teleperformance's website, the company says it is "working tirelessly" to protect the health of its employees while "ensuring business continuity for our clients," which include social media company Facebook Inc and streaming platform Netflix Inc. It has more than 300,000 call center workers worldwide and, according to its website, 85,945 of them were already working from home.
 Portugal declared a state of emergency on March 18 to stem the epidemic and extended it on Thursday for an extra 15 days. The restrictions make it mandatory for companies to adopt work-from-home policies whenever possible. One of the five employees with coronavirus, who wished to remain anonymous over fears of losing his job, said he tested positive on Tuesday but had worked last week while feeling ill.
 SNCC said that over the past weeks Teleperformance started to move workers home but the process had been too slow given the gravity of the situation. Portugal is not the only country in which the firm came under fire.
 In Mexico, more than 30,000 people have signed a petition urging Teleperformance to allow its employees to work from home to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

Receivers Armanti Edwards and S.J. Green and offensive lineman Derek Dennis are also available after playing in the XFL.
 And then there's the uncertainty surrounding the 2020 season. The CFL has postponed indefinitely the start of training camp due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
 The pandemic has forced Ball to be imaginative with his off-season workouts as gyms are closed. But the challenge hasn't been insurmountable because Ball also works as a personal trainer and has equipment at his home.
 'I've had to dip into my bag of tricks of the trade," Ball said. "But I've always been kind of a solitary workout guy and my in-home training hasn't really changed.
 "I've got the equipment I've always need — bands, weights, anything you could think about. I wake up every morning before the crack of dawn to get my miles in. I'm fine conditioning-wise."
 The pandemic has also allowed the Ball family to spend more time together.
 "We exercise together, we've had camping nights, homework and class work, board games, card games," Ball said. "We've had numerous movie nights, we've had Frozen 2 on repeat all week . . . and we actually have Frozen 2 monopoly game.
 "You see where I'm going with it . . .but it's all good. We also have chalk drawings on the driveway and in the garage, anything you can think of, my wife and I are pretty much planning it up. This thing is making everybody spend more time with family, which is important and something I really enjoy."
 But the pandemic has impacted Ball's off-season occupation and work as a coach of a seven-on-seven high school football team.
 "I'm talking about 20-to-25 high school kids who love the game of football," Ball said. "Not seeing those guys and not being with the kids has been a bummer but at the same time we have Facetime, Instagram and TikTok so we kind of stay in touch.
 "It's tough out here, man. That's not to say my story is worse than anyone else's. I know it's hard for everybody."
 But the off-season has only served to strengthen Ball's football resolve.
 "This is probably the hungriest and most motivated I've been in a while," Ball said. "I can't remember being this pissed off in workouts and training and preparations.
 "To be honest with you, yes, I will be a hungry man walking into someone's locker-room. A healthy, hungry man."

"The offer from Minnesota Duluth has been in the works for a while," Gerber told BadgerBlitz.com. "Its defense has a hybrid defensive end/outside linebacker, so that played a big part, I think. And then Coach (Chad) Henning from Upper Iowa and I had been communicating for a while, back to when he was at Mankato State. It felt good to get those offers. I know that I have what it takes to play at the next level, but it was nice to finally pull a couple of offers in.
 "Outside of those two schools, I have been to junior days at Nebraska and North Dakota State. I am also in contact with Air Force, South Dakota, South Dakota State, Minnesota State Mankato, Northern Illinois and Northern Iowa."
 This past fall, Gerber, who 51 tackles and six sacks during an honorable mention all-state campaign, was able to see two Big Ten programs. He is teammates with current Badgers' running back commit Loyal Crawford.
 "This fall I had the opportunity to take game-day visits at Iowa, South Dakota State and Wisconsin," Gerber said. "I was going to go to a junior day at Northern Illinois, but I came down with the flu and haven’t been able to get there.
 "With Wisconsin, they have been to school a couple of times this year in the weight room to watch Loyal and me. I did talk to Coach (Chris) Haering then, but I haven’t heard anything since. I’m not sure how interested they are."
 Like many recruits across the country, Gerber is trying to navigate the process without being able to take on-campus visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 "It’s been tough because this is a pivotal time in my recruitment," Gerber said. "I had a couple visits that have been cut out. I was going to attend the WFCA combine, which would have been big in recruiting for me, but that just got cancelled.
 "When things open back up, I would like to go back to South Dakota State and out to NIU, along with Mankato State."
 Gerber's size and skillset makes him an intriguing edge prospect at the level. He has the ability to play with his hand down at the line of scrimmage or standing up as a linebacker.
 "I'm being recruited as both an outside linebacker and defensive end," Gerber said. "It depends on the school and what they run. I am being told I would play defensive end at some schools, but others say they see me more as an outside linebacker."

“I’m telling my parents who live in the northeast Valley to stay home, but they have neighbors not taking it seriously, saying, ‘We’re OK, there’s no cases here in Pacoima,’” Cuevas said.
 Ferrer said because of the lack of testing it would be a “really, really erroneous assumption” to think that the number of cases reported in any given community is reflective of how many it actually has.
 “There are thousands of people who are positive for COVID-19 that have not been tested, don’t necessarily know that they’re positive. They may have mild illness, they may be fairly asymptomatic,” Ferrer said. “There are people in every community that have the potential to infect others. And you could be one of them that’s infecting others. Or you could be one of them that’s getting infected.”
 One of the lowest rates of confirmed cases is in Pomona on L.A. County’s eastern edge. Resident Dwight Pennington said that could be because the city experienced the county’s first COVID-19 fatality — a patient that Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center announced on March 9 had died after being brought in by ambulance in full cardiac arrest.
 “I think people got the message because it was in our own backyard,” said Pennington, 27. But he thinks, based on personal experience, that Pomona’s low numbers could also be due to lack of testing.
 Pennington, who works as a wellness advocate for the Tri-City Mental Health Center, recently tried to get tested for COVID-19 because he developed a cough, but was told by his primary doctor and three urgent care facilities that they didn’t have test kits. He said he would’ve kept calling more hospitals if there was a guarantee they’d have the kits.
 Though Pennington said he’s confident he doesn’t have the virus, he remembers the experience as “really nerve-wracking.”
 Chandra Ford, a professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said there is likely “testing bias” in the data because tests haven’t been equally available across the county.
 As more people get tested in the coming months, areas with greater shares of homeless people and uninsured workers will see infection rates rise disproportionately, she said.
 “Over the long run the population of people who were missed are likely to be the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Ford, founding director of the Center for the Study of Racism, Social Justice and Health at UCLA. “I expect what we will see is the nature of the epidemic in Southern California will actually shift where these vulnerable populations will account for a greater share of the new cases.”
 University of Minnesota epidemiologist Ryan Demmer said the available data on current infections at the neighborhood level here reflects a broader nationwide trend of healthcare access.
 “More affluence is usually linked to a higher likelihood of being diagnosed with a chronic disease if the disease is actually present,” Demmer said.
 Still, focusing on confirmed cases can be misleading in the first place because so many people have been unable to get tested, according to health experts. A much better indicator of the outbreak’s spread, they say, is the number of deaths and hospitalizations, including how many people end up in intensive care units.
 L.A. County Department of Public Health data show the number of people who have died or been hospitalized with the virus has risen in recent days, but those figures are not broken down beyond the county level.
 Back in Inglewood, where the rate of infection has been reported as 32 cases per 100,000 population, Woods said she has little faith in the accuracy of recent statistics, “because I know that people are not being tested widespread.”
 She worries a longstanding mistrust of the healthcare system and other barriers play a role in the nonchalance she has seen in the black community. Men in her neighborhood still cluster on the corners. Teens ride their bikes in groups. Her neighbors are still gathering and partying. Very few people are wearing gloves or masks. There’s hardly any social distancing happening.
 “I know what happens in low-income, underserved communities and communities of color,” she said. “It could be like New Orleans. I’m afraid for South L.A.”
 She worries that people’s behavior will not change until they know somebody who has tested positive. By then, it might be too late and disease could be rampant in the community.
 The coronavirus has already touched Woods in more ways than one. On Tuesday, she spoke of a family friend — a black man from South L.A. — who was fighting for his life after contracting the virus along with dozens of other black people after going on a ski trip to Idaho.
 Later that day, Woods learned that the coronavirus claimed his life.

The forecast becomes a little more active over the next few days, which includes colder air and some precipitation. However, before we get to that, we have to get through a warm and windy day today. This morning we're waking up to mild conditions and a few clouds. Mostly sunny conditions will prevail through the day today as high temperatures rise into the mid 80s. Keep in mind, this is well above our average of 71° but no where near record breaking. Our daily high record for today is 92° set back in 2011. This afternoon will also be windy. Winds will turn to the west this afternoon sustained at 15-20 mph. These westerly winds will supply the dry and hot air this afternoon which means a good portion of the South Plains and all of eastern New Mexico is under an elevated fire weather risk.

The British government's worst case scenario envisages a coronavirus death toll of 50,000 if self isolation is not fully adhered to, but the United Kingdom is not right now on course for a toll of that scale, a source familiar with the government's emergency discussions said. According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, the worst day for deaths is projected to be April 12, which this year is Easter Sunday.
 The worst case death toll would be based on partial adherence to quarantine by the population at a level of about 50%, according to the government scenario, the source said. A so-called "good" outcome in the circumstances would be a death toll of fewer than 20,000 in the United Kingdom, according to the source. A Downing Street spokeswoman declined immediate comment.
 "Sadly the coronavirus continues to grow," Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. "The best scientific analysis is that the rate of infection has been doubling every three to four days." The United Kingdom's coronavirus death toll rose 24 percent in one day to 2,921, as of April 1. As of 0800 GMT on April 2, a total of 163,194 people had been tested of which 33,718 tested positive, the British health ministry said.
 Stephen Powis, the national medical director of National Health Service England, said at a Downing Street briefing on Thursday that a high death rate would continue to be seen for "a few weeks yet". "There are still reasons to be hopeful," Powis said. "We do see early academic evidence that the transmission rate in the community may have fallen below 1."
 Powis said on Sunday that the United Kingdom would be doing well if it kept the coronavirus death toll below 20,000. According to a study by Imperial College last month, if no measures had been taken by governments then the outbreak would have caused more than half a million deaths in Britain and 2.2 million in the United States.
 Global coronavirus deaths topped 50,200 on Thursday as the pandemic ravages the United States and Europe, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

This is not the case in England, where pay television subscribers are more easily able to buy sports channels separately. Sky Sports, the main provider of televised sports, is allowing customers to pause their subscription payments as long as sports remain postponed.
 Some sports networks abroad are also beginning to push back against leagues. Canal+ in France, Globo in Brazil and NENT in the Nordic countries have all suspended some rights payments.
 Television is the biggest source of revenue for American sports. When people pay their monthly television bills, their money goes to television distributors, like Comcast, which in turn pay television networks, like ESPN, which in turn pay sports leagues, like the N.B.A. Along the way, everybody keeps a cut.
 But even if customers do not watch a single game, the majority of what they spend on bundled television packages goes to sports networks. This is because of the structure of the bundles, where customers pay one monthly price for dozens or hundreds of channels.
 Entertainment is available widely on streaming services, while news and sports programming is increasingly the only reason to still pay for bundled TV.
 “Sports are the glue that holds the bundle together,” Moffett said. “Without live sports, the value proposition to most households just isn’t terribly compelling anymore.”
 Television viewership, especially of news programming, is up lately, no doubt the consequence of nearly 300 million Americans under orders to stay at home. But with jobless claims reaching a record high, how many more people will look to cut the cord or, at the very least, push back on being charged for sports without getting live games?
 “A lot of them are going to get very familiar with how their TV service actually works, and how they can get rid of cable once and for all,” said Dave Warner, who created the website What You Pay for Sports in 2013 to educate fans about their television bills.
 McPherson, the Verizon executive, said the company had been recently reviewing its contractual relationships with networks and leagues in an attempt to reduce what the roughly four million Fios TV subscribers are paying.
 “We don’t want to charge our customers for content they aren’t watching and receiving,” she said. “Whether that is going to be in the form of a refund or discontinued billing, we are looking at all of those options right now.”
 However, Verizon does not feel it can unilaterally rebate subscribers. ”We need the broadcasters and RSNs, and the leagues, to cooperate with that approach,” McPherson said.
 In at least being willing to discuss whether subscribers are currently getting what they pay for, McPherson is alone. AT&T, Comcast, Charter Communications and Dish Network — the four largest pay TV providers in the United States — all declined to make an executive available for an interview or answer questions about what subscribers should expect.
 Television distributors have historically felt they held little leverage in negotiations with sports networks. What networks pay sports leagues goes up each year. Sports networks raise prices as a result and pass large price increases on to distributors, who pass them on to subscribers.
 One way distributors have pushed back — and tried to deflect subscriber wrath — is by listing the costs for sports as a separate line item in bills, often terming it a “regional sports fee.” It is purposefully made to look like the actual fees and taxes imposed by state or federal regulators, but it is not the same.
 The model of regional sports networks, which has been so profitable for two decades, is showing signs of strain. The satellite television provider DISH Network has not carried 16 Fox Sports regional networks for the last nine months. A new Chicago sports network is having trouble getting distribution. Comcast has been sued by a Colorado regional sports network.
 In other words, the balance of the sports television ecosystem was already being disrupted before the coronavirus pandemic shut down sports. “Now imagine you have pulled out the last piece of the Jenga puzzle, which is that sports are no longer on the air,” Moffett said. “The whole foundation, the linchpin that was keeping it together, is gone, and the Jenga tower collapses.”
 The first sign of that collapse in America comes from DAZN, the sports streaming service that mostly shows boxing and baseball highlights in the United States, but is a major rightsholder in some other countries. DAZN has told some leagues it will defer payments for suspended or canceled competitions, according to two people familiar with the negotiations. Since it doesn’t receive payments from distributors as traditional television networks do, DAZN is attempting to conserve its cash.
 “DAZN is a pure sport play — when sports stops, so do many parts of our business,” wrote Simon Denyer, the chief executive of DAZN, in an email to employees on Tuesday announcing furloughs. The news was first reported by the Sports Business Journal.
 Regional sports networks, along with teams and leagues, face the biggest threat from a prolonged shutdown of live action, according to Moody’s Investor Service. If consumers balk at keeping subscriptions to sports networks, it “may affect affiliate fees unless their networks are part of the basic tier of pay TV,” wrote Moody’s in a recent research comment.
 That is little help to television subscribers like Sanz.
 She said she bought a Roku and is considering completely abandoning cable in favor of streaming. She has also called other companies that provide services she subscribes to, just to see if they would offer any discounts. When she reached Adobe, which charges her $39.99 each month for its Creative Cloud suite, she was given three free months. A small reprieve maybe, but significant.
 “It does matter at this point, when there is no income coming into the house,” she said.

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Cruise ships carrying dozens of passengers and crew displaying symptoms of the coronavirus awaited final word Thursday on when they would be able to dock at a Florida port after officials gave their tentative approval and the state’s governor dropped his previously firm opposition.Officials were waiting for a final document, expected to arrive on Thursday, that was required to clear the Zaandam and a sister ship, the Rotterdam, to disembark at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine said on Twitter.For nearly three weeks, passengers have not been able to step on dry land, and four elderly passengers have died on the Zaandam, at least two from COVID-19, Carnival Cruise Lines, which owns the ships, said in a statement. Nine people have tested positive for the new coronavirus, Carnival said.There are 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam, and 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam. The Rotterdam was sent last week to take in some of the passengers and provide assistance to the Zaandam since it was denied permission to dock at ports in South America.About 230 have reported influenza-like symptoms since March 22, including 14 aboard the Rotterdam, while 45 currently are mildly ill, Holland America Line, the company that operates the ships, has said.Udine told The Associated Press that commissioners hadn't received the document but were also awaiting confirmation from the sheriff that local officials could handle a safe disembarkation and transfer those who need medical care.Both ships were listed on the Port Everglades schedule Thursday while details for the conditions of the passengers' arrival were still being finalized, said port spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy.In an email sent Wednesday night, Holland America said it had received approval from a hospital in Fort Lauderdale to treat fewer than 10 people "who need immediate critical care." Jennifer Smith, a spokesman for Broward Health medical center, said it would accept the critically ill patients from the ship.Originally firmly opposed to the ships' arrival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told Fox News network on Thursday that transferring critically ill patients to hospitals was "the humanitarian thing to do.""There is no easy solution to this," DeSantis said.DeSantis' comments came a day after President Donald Trump suggested that he had spoken to the governor and persuaded him to allow the ships to dock in Florida."We have to do something ... and the governor knows that, too," Trump said Wednesday.The passengers who are healthy need to get off the ships, and the rest need to be treated urgently, the nation's top infectious disease official, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on Thursday. "You have to take care of the people who are ill. You just have an obligation to do that. And as quickly as possible," Fauci said on "CBS This Morning."Passengers and crew who have no symptoms of the virus will be bused to airports and will not be allowed inside the terminals, but will instead directly board airplanes, DeSantis said."You can't just release them into the general public if they have been exposed," he said.Holland America has said that guests fit for travel under guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control would transfer "straight from the ship to flights for onward travel home, the majority on charter flights.""Out of an abundance of caution, these guests will be transported in coaches that will be sanitized, with limited person-to-person contact and while wearing masks," the company said in a statement.Guests have not left the ship since March 14 and have self-isolated in their staterooms since March 22, the company said.The cruise line said the 45 guests who are still mildly ill and unfit to travel would continue to isolate on board until recovered. They would be allowed to leave only after they have recovered sufficiently under CDC guidelines.For most people, the virus causes symptoms including a fever, cough and body aches that clear up in two to three weeks without hospitalization But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia, in which case respirators may be necessary for survival.Passenger Laura Gabaroni was transferred to the Rotterdam, along with husband Juan Huergo and other passengers not showing signs of illness. She told The Associated Press early Thursday that they had not been updated by the captain about plans for disembarking from the ship.Gabaroni and Huergo, both defense contractors in Orlando, set sail on a dream vacation aboard the Zaandam the day before the U.S. State Department advised people to avoid cruise travel and before any substantial restrictions were in place in Florida.The Zaandam set sail from Buenos Aires on March 7 and was originally scheduled to end the first leg of the voyage at San Antonio, Chile, on March 21 before departing again for Fort Lauderdale. The cruise was stranded off the coast of Panama after it was not allowed to dock in Chile and other ports along its path.Copyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Wall Street bounced on Thursday as hopes of a truce between Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut oil output drove a record 22% surge in prices, outweighing the shock of over 6 million Americans filing for jobless claims due to virus-led lockdowns.
 The S&P; energy index, down by half this year, climbed 10%, with big gains for majors Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp powering a near 2% rise for both the S&P; 500 and the Dow Jones. Saudi Arabia has called for an emergency meeting of oil producers, while U.S. President Donald Trump said he expected the kingdom and Russia to cut output by as much as 10 million to 15 million barrels a day.
 "The surge in crude is helping the mood, so we're seeing some relief in markets that have been hammered," said Richard Steinberg, chief market strategist at Colony Group, in Florida. The list of top gainers on the benchmark S&P; 500 was dominated by oil companies. Apache Corp, Diamondback Energy Inc and Helmerich Payne advanced between 14% and 16%.
 Brent was on track for its biggest one-day gain on record, but prices are still far from recovering last month's steep losses. A bump in prices may still not be enough to save some of the debt-laden U.S. shale companies that are on the brink of bankruptcy as demand continues to plunge, wrought by the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts foresee a further decline in U.S. stocks as country-wide shutdowns to limit the spread of the virus result in a virtual halt in business activity and force companies to lay off employees and save cash.
 Boeing Co, once a symbol of America's industrial might, has offered buyout and early retirement packages to employees. Meanwhile, initial claims for unemployment benefits last week rose to 6.65 million, exceeding the top end of economists' estimates at 5.25 million.
 "They are really eye popping numbers, but at the end of the day it doesn't really tell the whole story because we knew they were going to be bad," said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management in New York. "The real question is what happens by the end of the year."
 At 12:52 p.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 377.55 points, or 1.80%, at 21,321.06, the S&P; 500 was up 49.73 points, or 2.01%, at 2,520.23 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 112.09 points, or 1.52%, at 7,472.67. Walgreens fell 7% after the drugstore retailer reported a steep decline in U.S same-store sales in the last week of March.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.90-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P; index recorded no new 52-week high and eight new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded three new highs and 70 new lows.

The travel ban forced anyone who lived in Argentina to get off the Princess ship and into a 14-day quarantine, Reynolds said.
 "Because so many of the ship's crew were put off in Argentina, it was up to the passengers to create entertainment," he said.
 Reynolds isn't shy, and he's doing what he can to lighten up the situation. As the YMCA fitness director, he's in front of people all the time, and he has years of theater and acting experience. He was in the "Choices and Chances" film produced by Charlotte County TV production manager Elizabeth Tracy last year.
 "So I have been teaching line dancing and fitness classes on the ship," he said. "We were listed in the daily 'Patter' for the day. The cruise director introduced myself and Bill. There were about 150 people in attendance and people were having a great time line dancing. Employees told us that was a first for any special class led by a passenger.
 "There's nothing else to do, so we are having fun."
 Despite other cruise ships having sick passengers aboard, Reynolds said his ship has has not had any cases of COVID-19.
 "We have mandatory temperature checks twice a day, and then some are done randomly," Reynolds said. "It's done in an orderly fashion. There's no chaos. We are practicing social distancing. We are washing our hands. "
 Reynolds said the ship's crew has been "superb" with helping guests fill their depleted prescriptions.
 "Had we been able to get off the ship, we would have gone to the drug store to get refills," he said. "I would have run out of my medication by now. The crew asked us to fill out a form and they filled the script. It was painless. I believe that's kept people healthy."
 Then Princess Cruises recently announced a voluntarily pause of the global operations of its 18 cruise ships for two months.
 That decisions impacted Reynolds again. He was supposed to go on another cruise in mid-April with his grandchildren, but it's canceled. The family was offered a 100% refund or a $600-per person credit.
 "My grandkids heard the president say that things would be better by Easter, so they got their hopes up that we were still going on the cruise," he said. "That's not the case. We will eventually get to go. We love Princess Cruises. They have been fantastic to the passengers. They covered our phone calls so we can talk to our loved ones. We have free internet too. We are not panicked."

“From our other set-aside funding, we’re providing $5,500 to Restoration Christian Community Church and $3,850 to the SCORE program on the south side of Port Huron,” Maiers said.
 The idea for the fund came internally from the community foundation.
 “We’re the largest and oldest grant-making foundation in either Macomb or St. Clair County, which is both good and bad news,” Maiers said. “We don’t have any billion-dollar foundations or corporations up here, so our foundation has created a culture of leading the way when we can in order to help our region take control of our future.”
 When asked the importance of establishing the fund, Maiers said local residents and businesses need to know they can make donations to a reliable source that can guarantee that 100% of all gifts will go back to their community.
 “Because we’re kind of a small-town region, we are blessed with great working relationships with our local units of government, our hospitals and health care providers and our frontline service providers who are dealing with this crisis every hour,” he said. “But the truth is we can’t wait or rely on any other mega foundation to focus on our region, given the terrible crisis unfolding in the Detroit area. We have to take care of ourselves.”
 Maiers said that during times like this, he is proud of the small-town region and the tremendous passion of people to give back and make gifts.
 “We can promise the public that not only will 100% of these gifts go back to the community, but we will be completely transparent about where their money goes,” he said. “Additionally, although we are now dealing with the immediate crisis at hand, we know that in the near future our region will begin its recovery phase and our attention will turn to how we can leverage philanthropy to help get our local small businesses up and running and thriving again.”
 He said the foundation has already begun discussions with Dan Casey at the Economic Development Alliance to get ready for the next phase in its philanthropic work.
 “We definitely see a time when our lens of philanthropy turns its attention to growth, recovery and prosperity,” he said.

Mortgage lenders are preparing for the biggest wave of delinquencies in history. If the plan to buy time works, they may avert an even worse crisis: Mass foreclosures and mortgage market mayhem.
 Borrowers who lost income from the coronavirus — already a skyrocketing number, with a record 10 million new jobless claims — can ask to skip payments for up to 180 days at a time on federally backed mortgages, and avoid penalties and a hit to their credit scores. But it’s not a payment holiday. Eventually, they’ll have to make it all up.
 As many as 30% of Americans with home loans — about 15 million households — could stop paying if the U.S. economy remains closed through the summer or beyond, according to an estimate by Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics.
 “This is an unprecedented event,” said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “The great financial crisis happened over a number of years. This is happening in a matter of months — a matter of weeks.”

N95 respirators are considered the gold standard for those on the frontlines. When worn properly — securely fitted to a wearer’s face — they offer protection from about 95% of small particles (0.3 microns in size) and large droplets. Individual coronavirus particles are smaller than this. But when they are coughed or sneezed up, they likely travel in small clumps of spit and mucus.
 The WHO and the CDC only recommend N95s for health care workers at the greatest risk of virus exposure, such as those who test patients for COVID-19 by swabbing their noses or mouths or those who connect patients to respirators. In an ideal setting, N95s are only worn once and then tossed out. But due to supply shortages, health care workers are having to repeatedly wear the respirators, raising questions about whether the masks are getting contaminated from repeated exposures and removals. No one is recommending the public wear N95 respirators.
 Surgical masks are the next step down, offering protection against large droplets. This is the type of mask CDC currently recommends for most health care workers, caregivers, and people who are sick. In recent weeks, a wave of hospitals in Boston, San Francisco, and Providence, and other US cities, have started requiring all of their health care workers wear these masks, six doctors and nurses told BuzzFeed News.
 The current shortage of surgical masks for health care workers is shaping the government’s thinking on whether to start recommending them to the public.
 Consequently, the discussions over changing the CDC’s mask guidance are about whether most people should start wearing homemade fabric masks, which may offer some protection against large droplets but don’t protect against small particles in the air. Not considered official “personal protective equipment” by the CDC, the agency only recommends them for health care workers “as a last resort.” Their effectiveness against droplets is unknown due to minimal study and the wide range in fabric materials that can be used.
 According to a 2013 study in the journal Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, fabric masks that fit snugly on the face provided three times less protection than surgical masks. “We found they are not as good as surgical masks,” Anna Davies, the lead study author, told BuzzFeed News.
 Davies and her colleagues found a surgical mask had about a 90% filtration efficiency for very small particles (around 2 microns). The next best materials found at home at blocking particles were vacuum cleaner bags (about 86% filtration efficiency) and tea towels (about 72% filtration efficiency), but they would be so difficult to breathe out of that they wouldn’t be suitable for a mask. Meanwhile, a cotton mix material had about 70% filtration efficiency compared to roughly 57% for a pillowcase, about 62% for linen, about 54% for silk, nearly 51% for a 100% cotton T-shirt, and nearly 49% for a scarf.
 “An improvised face mask should be viewed as the last possible alternative if a supply of commercial face masks is not available,” the study authors wrote, and should be paired with other protective measures.
 Davies noted this was a very small study, not a clinical trial, and that much more research was needed on the effectiveness of homemade masks in a pandemic environment.
 Some of the health experts most resistant to universal mask-wearing largely cite concerns that people would not wear masks properly or adhere to other safety precautions less as a result. If someone is constantly fidgeting with their mask, or is emboldened to get closer to people than 6 feet or leave the house more than they might otherwise, the potential benefits of a mask would likely be negated.
 “I suspect probably if everyone wore masks, and alongside all social distancing, you’d probably see a reduction in transmission,” Davies said. “The masks don’t give you a normal life back, unfortunately.”
 Many questions remain about how to best use fabric masks: How do you decontaminate them? Can they be reused? How long should you wear a homemade mask for?
 But public health officials are increasingly coming on board to the idea of more people covering their faces, or at least supporting people who want to.
 “No one should be yelled at because they decide to wear a mask,” said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. “They are not crazy. They are trying to protect themselves. And may it reduce their risk a little bit? Maybe.” ●

HARARE -- The United Nations food agency has negotiated a humanitarian corridor to keep food aid flowing in southern Africa after many countries shut their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus, an official said on Thursday.
 Up to 45 million people in southern Africa face hunger following a devastating drought and two cyclones last year, and there are growing fears the crisis could be compounded by the outbreak of the virus.
 Lola Castro, World Food Programme director for southern Africa, said South Africa had agreed to let vessels carrying food aid land on its shores and move it to countries like Zimbabwe, Malawi, Botswana and Namibia, which face food shortages.
 Castro told reporters during a video conference that Africa's most advanced economy, which has declared a 21-day lockdown, had agreed to "a sort of humanitarian corridor," a move that would help the agency continue its work.
 "At this moment we are actually maintaining our normal food distributions but maybe in the future, depending with the effect of the virus and effect on the food system, especially on the smallholder farmers … maybe we will see an increase in prices and number of people who require food assistance," she said.
 More than $400 million was required to import food aid for the next three months in southern Africa, which has received patchy rains this year, said Castro.
 Africa has registered more than 6,650 cases of coronavirus and over 240 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.
 The continent is already suffering a huge economic impact from lockdowns aiming to contain the virus and a sharp fall in global demand for commodities.
 Daily lives have been upended in many African countries due to tough lockdowns that have affected swathes of populations that rely on informal trade for a living.
 Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organisation regional director for Africa, said African governments had to balance the need for physical distancing measures with making sure that families had food on the table.
 "The potential economic impact is of great concern at the lowest socio- economic levels," Moeti said.
 Zimbabwe and the United Nations on Thursday made a joint appeal for $770 million in humanitarian aid to help the country cope with a drought and the coronavirus as well as to fund its education and health sectors.
 The government also launched a separate $2.2 billion aid appeal from foreign and domestic donors.
 South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had risen to 1,462, an increase of 82 from Wednesday, but that people shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of security by a slower rate of increase in recent days.
 "It's still very early days… We need to still get out and go and find more and more of the people who could be positive out in the community," he said.
 Zambia reported the country's first death from coronavirus.
 Malawi recorded its first three cases. All three people were in medical care and health workers were tracing their contacts.

I wasn't always an editor at Business Insider.
 At one point, I was a college student studying the dramatic arts, and that plus a history degree didn't turn me into a theater historian but a financial journalist. Go figure. But it also meant that my nighttime entertainment for the better part of a decade was in dark theaters, seeing actual humans act out lines from a play.
 When I moved to New York City, it got too expensive to keep seeing that much theater. I was rarely able to see a show for less than $75 per ticket. I landed relatively cheap tickets --around $80 -- to an early preview of "The Book of Mormon," by the creators of "South Park." When the show officially opened, prices were triple that. Shows like "Hamilton" were so popular that hopeful attendees could gamble on getting a $10 ticket via a lottery or shell out upwards of $849 for front-row seats. It was a stressful hobby!
 Over time, though, I realized I could get a theater fix for only $18 at participating movie theaters for something called "National Theatre Live," which piped in recorded shows of mostly British drama from the mothership in London. America doesn't have a national theatre/theater, which is a subject for a different article (or maybe a different stimulus package).
 But then the coronavirus came, and it devastated whole stretches of the economy, including the cultural spaces that depend on human interaction, like museums, galleries, and theaters. But something surprising has happened.

"The big problem is that Harry has no marketable skills, has never had a real job," the source added. "He does not have a university degree nor does he know a second language. He only has military training."
 True, but... he's also been Prince Harry, for crying out loud. We'd say that definitely counts as work experience, and we can't see him in a traditional job, anyway. Wouldn't he have to find other ways to make money regardless, like through speaking engagements and leveraging his past as a member of the royal family?

Why – after 25 years – do I believe that this time will be different? Because old PG&E has been shown the door. Those owning the company have been replaced by new investors, not involved before these fires. The Governor demanded a refreshment of the board of directors of PG&E for the second time and two years to ensure that the distorted culture of PG&E is repaired for good. The Chief Executive Officer? Replaced! Not enough tree trimmers? PG&E is now under the thumb of a federal judge requiring that thousands of tree trimmers work around the clock to reduce wildfire risk. Unilateral control over how much is spent on safety? No more! Governor Newsom wisely insisted on safety bench marks, which if not met will lead to a loss of PG&E’s license. And this company’s reign of safety terror over our state IS NOW OVER!

So within this whole line, you might have a few storms that are capable of producing stronger winds." Explains William Iwasko, a Meteorologist from the National Weather Service.
