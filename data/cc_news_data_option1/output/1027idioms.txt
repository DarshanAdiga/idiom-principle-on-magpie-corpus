The postponement of production on these shows is the latest notable effect coronavirus has had on Hollywood.


  This week, several film release dates have been pushed back, including those for "Mulan" and "The New Mutants."


  Several late-night and daytime television shows that feature live audiences have also suspended that practice in response to the pandemic or put a hold on production all together.


  On Friday, Netflix paused scripted TV and film production in the US and Canada for two weeks due to government restrictions and health/safety precautions, a source with knowledge of the situation told CNN.


  HBO said "Last Week Tonight" and "Real Time with Bill Maher" would temporarily halt production.


  "Last Week Tonight" will air a shortened episode on Sunday before beginning hiatus.


  Production on Warner Bros. Television's "Riverdale" was suspended, but in that case, it was in response to a team member's exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus.


  Warner Bros. Television and HBO, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.


  On Thursday, the Apple TV+ drama "The Morning Show," which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, ceased production, with the company saying it would stay down for two weeks.


  "In concert with our dedicated partners at Apple, we have concluded it would be prudent to take a two-week hiatus to assess the situation and ensure the safety of the incredible people who make this show," Media Res founder and CEO Michael Ellenberg said in a statement to CNN.


  CNN's Natasha Chen contributed to this report.

The Polish government has put the country under a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced on Friday evening, ceasing all cross-border road, air and rail passenger traffic as of Sunday.      The measures apply for at least 10 days, with a possible extension of another 20 days, Morawiecki said.      Non-Polish nationals will be barred from entering the country outright after Saturday. Polish nationals are allowed to enter by road and chartered flights, on the condition of a 14-day home quarantine immediately after return. Domestic traffic is to stay uninterrupted.      By the time of the press conference on Friday evening, Poland had 68 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and one death.      "Unfortunately, we are expecting an increase in the number of people infected by the coronavirus," Morawiecki said. "We have to use our medical resources to the maximum effect, and therefore we want to stymie the flow of new people from abroad."      "We are closing the doors to the pandemic," Morawiecki added that cross-border transport of goods will continue as normal.      The Polish government has also closed malls, restaurants, clubs, bars and casinos and banned all gatherings of over 50 people.      Shops, including those operated in malls, pharmacies, laundries and banks are to operate normally, while restaurants are allowed to cater to takeaway orders.      Morawiecki appealed to employers to allow their staff to work from home wherever possible, and that children and youth should stay at home and should not be sent to stay with their grandparents, so as to protect elderly people.

Gedu said the main disagreement “stems from Egypt’s refusal to accept the rights other countries have on the river. There are attempts to enforce colonial agreements but that will never be accepted by Ethiopia. I know the Nile River is God’s gift for Egypt. The same is true for Ethiopia and Sudan. Egyptians should come to terms with that.”

Now, do not misunderstand me. If finding your soul mate is in the cards for you, then creating a dating profile is the way to go. However, not everyone is looking to poetically describe their perfect date and love of “Long walks on the beach”. This is the only downfall with many of these popular dating sites. They exclude and do not cater to a vast portion of the homosexual population who are not seeking a soul mate.
