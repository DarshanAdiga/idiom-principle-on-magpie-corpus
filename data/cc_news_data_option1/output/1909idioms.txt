MACOMB -- Per Governor J.B. Pritzker's Stay at Home Executive Order issued on March 20, all child care programs were closed on March 21 to help slow the spread of COVID-19. However, child care facilities caring for the children of essential workers have been allowed to remain open under certain guidelines.


   


  Catch A Star Learning Center is one such local daycare facility that has implemented changes in light of the stay at home order. Catch A Star Learning Center, located at 424 W. Piper St. in Macomb, has been in business for 23 years and is licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services to work with children aged six weeks to 12 years. Upon receiving word that many child care facilities would be closing on March 21, they immediately applied for an Emergency Child Care license and submitted background check forms for their staff.


   


  "We were able to remain open on Monday [after the executive order] and continue providing care without any of our parents missing a single day of work," said Kimberly Hare, director of Catch A Star Learning Center.


   


  Hare said that Catch A Star has been utilizing the McDonough County Health Department as a resource. Additionally, they are following guidelines from the Illinois Department of Human Services, the Illinois State Board of Education, the Governor's Office of Early Childhood Development, and the CDC.


   


  Cautionary steps that Catch A Star is reportedly engaging in include checking the temperatures of teachers, staff, and children daily; requiring frequent handwashing of both staff and children; and frequently disinfecting toys and surfaces. Staff members and parents are required to wear protective face masks, while children over the age of three are encouraged to do so. Additionally, teachers may only work in one classroom while groups of children cannot mix throughout the day. Per the McDonough County Health Department's guidelines, staff members and children that have a temperature of 100.4 or higher, a cough, sore throat, or breathing difficulties will be sent home for seven days. Those that have exhibited flu-like symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, or have been in contact with someone being tested for COVID-19 are unable to enter the daycare. Only one parent is permitted into the building entryway at a time.


   


  "Catch A Star received a one time stipend from the State of Illinois to help us purchase supplies during the pandemic, so that was great. Actually getting the supplies here and delivered is another story," said Hare. "We are going through 75 thermometer ear probe covers a day, at a cost of about 10 cents each."


   


  Catch A Star, with their current Emergency Child Care license, is allowed to care for 100 children, with only 10 children in each classroom.


   


  "Typically, our School Age Summer Program involves daily field trips with a hired air-conditioned bus and driver. We are currently restructuring those plans in case we are not able to visit public areas due to continued business closings," said Hare.


   


  Catch A Star is working to incorporate activities that require less traveling such as science experiments, art, reading programs, and recess.


   


  Hare stated that Catch A Star has switched from buying groceries locally to buying from commercial food deliveries companies as to leave more food on the shelves for the community.


   


  Per the Governor's Office of Early Childhood Development, for as long as the public health emergency continues: licensed and licensed-exempt child care homes can serve up to six children of essential workers as a legally license- exempt home. Additionally, certain license-exempts centers may serve up to ten children within no more than five classrooms. Centers that wished to reopen as Emergency Child Care Centers were told to apply for an appropriate license.


   


  Under this licensure, child care facilities may care for up to ten children per classroom, with it being recommended that they serve no more than 50 children in total. Legally license-exempt centers may also remain open under the same guidelines. Other child care programs are to remain closed until the stay at home order is lifted.


   


  During this time, the children of prioritized essential workers, such as those working in health care, human services, essential government services, and essential infrastructure, are eligible to receive child care through the Illinois Department of Human Services Child Care Assistance Program.


   


  According to the Illinois Network of Child Care Resource and Referral Agencies, over 3,000 emergency child care sites (over 2,000 homes and over 500 centers) are available to essential workers. 31 percent of all licensed child care programs in Illinois have reported that they are available as an emergency child care site for essential workers.


   


  A dedicated helpline has been created for Child Care Resources and Referral Agencies to connect essential worker families to emergency child care. This line can be reached at (888) 228-1146 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday.

WARNING AS AUSTRALIA EASES MEASURES: Restrictions put in place to stop the coronavirus from spreading across Australia have eased, but the public was warned to take their newfound freedoms carefully in order to prevent a second wave of the pandemic. States and territories have begun the first of a three- stage process to lift restrictions on outdoor and indoor gatherings and business operations. Australians will get to sit in pubs, cafes and restaurants for the first time in weeks after isolation and social distancing measures kept the lid on infections and COVID-19 deaths. But Australian Medical Association President Tony Bartone urged people to remain vigilant because the virus is still present in the community and could flare up. “If we do the wrong things, we risk undoing all the gains that we’ve made,” Batone said. “So, the message is, yes, appreciate all the efforts, appreciate the opportunity to release some of those measures, but let’s not have a party, let’s not go to town.” The number of active cases breached 7,000 on Friday, but the death toll from the pandemic remains at 98, extremely low by international standards.

  MACOMB -- Mayor Mike Inman plans to call for a moment of silence Monday in memory of two city firefighters. Deputy Chief John Ebey served on the department for 25 years prior to his retirement, and firefighter Don Garlick served on the department for nearly 30 years.


  The city council is scheduled to vote on contributing $5,000 to the demolition of the WIU Sigma Chi House at 611 West Adams Street as part of the Residential Initiative & Stabilization Effort.


  Aldermen may also vote on an amended resolution requesting $1.3 million in state motor fuel tax dollars for maintenance of streets and highways.


  Votes will be taken on spending $126,640 for maintenance of the wells at Spring Lake, and $39,600 for detection of leaks in the city water system.


  Public Works Director Alice Ohrtmann said she has received state direction for the city to reject the bid of

The New Hanover County Senior Resource Center has received a $25,000 grant from Meals on Wheels America for its food delivery program, which now delivers two meals per weekday in light of challenges posed by COVID-19.
   
 "With the stay at home order and social distancing efforts, we found that families were not able to visit their loved ones," said SRC Director Amber Smith. "That made it harder for families who normally provide other meals to homebound seniors."
   
 Since the late 1970s, the SRC's meal program has been delivering meals to seniors homebound by physical or cognitive limitations.
   
 It is currently serving more than 5,500 meals per week, with funds from the federal Older Americans Act and state Home and Community Care Block Grant, which the county matches.
   
 "Each meal has a protein (beef, chicken or pork), a fruit or vegetable and a carton of milk for calcium," said SRC Nutrition Program Manger Ellen Conner, adding that the criteria is set by the Older Americans Act. "Meals are required to have at least 700 calories and have restrictions for sodium."
   
 Prior to the outbreak, the SRC relied on volunteers to deliver one meal per senior Monday through Friday. But according to Smith, "about 80% of our volunteer base were older adults themselves," who stepped back to "protect their health."
   
 In their place, the SRC has turned to other volunteers and the county has enlisted Library and Department of Social Service employees, who are compensated for their time.
   
 Due to social distancing measures, the SRC has also replaced its congregant meal option, which served lunch in its dining hall, with a drive-thru pick-up option at four facilities.
   
 "You do have to be 60 years or older and first time individuals have to fill out a form required by the state, which we have onsite," said Smith. She asked that those intending to come call in advance at 910-798-6420.
