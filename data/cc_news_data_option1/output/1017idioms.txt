Let me start with coronavirus thoughts first. Our base case has moved generally to a mild recession. That was not the case earlier and that is based on new readings that we're getting, both from coronavirus and from the economy at large and also from how we're seeing sentiment change. So, in our base case, the first thing that we're looking at is that the virus continues to grow moderately and that the peak growth of the virus is toward the end of the second quarter.
 In China, we see that virus growth continues to fall, that there's pickup in economic activity, but less so in the service sectors, so folks aren't out and about yet. The seasonal effect that impacts the virus may show some impact on transmission in our base case and that certainly helps the growth rates slow. And, the mortality rate hovers around 1%, especially as testing rises in new countries, so US and Europe and also outside of elderly folks and those with pre-existing conditions.
 From an antivirus perspective, we see in our base case that there's some efficacy from using these antiviral drugs. It's not a slam dunk, but there's some efficacy there.
 From a policy response perspective, now, our base case is, first of all, interest rates and monetary policy that there's convergence around what the effective lower bounds are. And what I mean by that is, we've started cutting rates from a place that wasn't that high. Now we're not that high again and, at some point, we'll be at the lower bound of that. Other economies, specifically in Europe, are much closer to that lower bound. So, the amount of freedom that central bankers have around monetary policy is still a big question mark. We're also seeing some additional liquidity measures put into place and those are introduced to ensure that liquidity is there to help funding.
 From a fiscal perspective, and by the way, fiscal has been getting a lot of airtime recently, both in the US and especially in Europe and Asia. Our base case is that demand is focused on some stimulus and that we raise consumption, that is really what the fiscal stimulus is going to be about, improving consumption. The size of those packages, maybe 0.5% of global GDP [Gross Domestic Product] and the timing is a little bit slow. That all leads to global growth of GDP of around 2.4% a year, which importantly, is right under the threshold for a technical recession, and that's why our base case is a mild recession. We think there's a 60% chance of this happening.

Returning to a topic she broached a week earlier, Councillor Lisa Haun queried Planning Director Barb Wiens on the Town’s approach to billing property developers for charges owed to the municipality by “front loading” them—requiring payment in advance. Haun had raised the same issue at council’s strategic planning meeting on February 24, and received the same answer then as she did last week—the Town already requires developers to pay development charges up front, before construction starts. Asked later by the Voice to clarify what, in her view, the Town should be doing differently, Haun responded, “I ran my campaign based on ‘managed’ growth and I am doing my due diligence in ensuring that it is indeed the Town that is doing the managing versus the developers.” In the end, Haun requested that staff prepare a report to address her concerns.

Together with the specially developed front design, this also results in improved downforce for more road grip overall. At the sides, striking side skirts and the grown wheel arches show the well-known MANSORY signature. And here too, visual enjoyment and technical functionality go hand in hand. E.g. the new carbon components not only look impressively good, they also act as air fins and supply large amounts of fresh air to both the unit under the new full carbon engine hood and the rear brake system. The newly developed double diffuser is responsible for perfect airflow underneath the vehicle and the large rear spoiler in conjunction with the rear skirt is responsible for downforce on the rear axle. The vehicle width of the "MANSORY Cabrera" is also increased by 4 cm in the course of the body conversion.

LONDON -- British shoppers stripped supermarkets of pasta, toilet paper and canned food on Friday and all major soccer matches were suspended just hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted imposing stringent measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak.
 Johnson has said it would be counterproductive to implement draconian isolation measures as the peak of the epidemic is weeks away, but people were bracing for the worst.
 In a country once known as a beacon of Western political and economic stability, supermarket shelves were empty of basic ingredients for the first time since fuel protests prompted panic buying two decades ago.
 "I have never seen the supermarket look like that. It is chaos in there," said Fran Edwards, 45, who works in marketing and was leaving the Tesco in Twickenham, southwest London, with a shopping trolley filled to the brim.
 "I have decided to buy two weeks worth of food. There are really long queues and there is not enough stock. I don't want to panic. But at the same time I didn't want to be regretting this opportunity in a few days."
 Even soccer fell victim to the fears over coronavirus - following a raft of other sports events around the world that have been postponed, canceled or held behind closed doors.
 All elite soccer matches in England, including the Premier League, were suspended until April 4 on Friday due to the coronavirus pandemic, English soccer's governing bodies said in a joint statement.
 England's friendly internationals against Italy and Denmark at Wembley on March 27 and 31, respectively, will not take place, the FA said in a statement. The men's and women's FA Cup competitions have also been suspended.
 HOARDING
 British supermarket bosses have urged people not to panic and said that they can keep shelves stocked but anecdotal evidence from across Britain shows many people are hoarding basics.
 Trading is intense with some shop bosses saying it can only be compared to the pre-Christmas rush. A Reuters reporter witnessed arguments at one major supermarket with shoppers bickering over how much pasta each person should be allowed to buy.
 "I just want to be prepared for the worst," said Anita, 41, a teacher at a college, who asked not to use her last name. Her trolley was completely full. "You watch what is happening on the news and I do think are we being too relaxed in this country."
 Lidl in Hackney, east London, had no pasta, toilet paper, flour, tinned fish or oil. Sainsbury's in Charlton, southeast London, had neither pasta nor toilet paper on Friday. Tesco in New Maldon, southwest London, was empty of pasta, toilet paper, long life milk and cleaning products.
 Tesco at Brent Cross, north London, was stripped of toilet paper, liquid soap and many canned foods. Waitrose in the Canary Wharf financial district had neither pasta nor toilet paper on Thursday night.
 Britain believes that supermarkets have a resilient supply chain, a spokesman for Johnson said when asked about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
 Johnson warned on Thursday that many more families would see their loved ones die from coronavirus, as the government's chief scientific adviser said Britain likely has as many as 10,000 people infected.

LONDON -- First there was steel. Then there was aluminum. Now titanium joins the list of metals found to be threatening the national security of the United States.
 The U.S. Commerce Department launched a so-called Section 232 investigation into titanium sponge imports in March last year and submitted it to the White House in November.
 Commerce found that U.S. import dependency, amounting to 68% of the country's consumption in 2018, threatens the viability of the last U.S. producer of this intermediate form of a metal critical to both civilian and military aircraft manufacturers.
 President Donald Trump agrees.
 However, there will be no titanium tariffs to match those implemented on imports of both steel and aluminum in 2018.
 Rather, there will be talks with Japan, the dominant supplier of sponge to the U.S. market. And the Secretary of Defense is tasked with taking "all appropriate action" to support "domestic production capacity for the production of titanium sponge to meet national defense requirements." (Presidential Memorandum, Feb. 27, 2020).
 The preference for cooperation over confrontation with importers is partly down to titanium's unique supply chain. But it is also a sign that the Trump administration's critical metals policy is evolving beyond simple tariffs.
 LAST U.S. SPONGE PLANT MAY CLOSE
 If TIMET Corp's "aging production facility" closes, the "United States will be completely dependent on imports of titanium sponge and scrap, and will lack the surge capacity required to support defense and critical infrastructure needs in an extended national emergency," according to the Department of Commerce.
 TIMET, which is part of Precision Castparts, an industrial holding group owned by Berkshire Hathaway, is operating its Henderson plant in Nevada below capacity and needs to decide whether to invest in an upgrade of its chlorination plant.
 The company "has made it abundantly clear that substituting low-priced imports for domestic titanium sponge may be the most reasonable choice if the economics of domestic titanium sponge production do not improve," TIMET said in a May 22, 2019 submission to the Section 232 report.
 Allegheny Technologies Inc. has already made its choice. In 2016 it closed the only other domestic U.S. sponge facility at Rowley in Utah in favor of using imported sponge to refine into metal.
 FRAGILE SUPPLY CHAIN
 That tells you there is no shortage of titanium sponge in the world. Indeed, it is a market that has been struggling with excess production capacity for many years.
 Nor is there any shortage of the raw material that starts the titanium production process. Global reserves of ilmenite and rutile are plentiful and one of the world's largest producers, Rio Tinto Fer et Titane, is operating just over the Canadian border.
 There is no obvious imminent threat to U.S. titanium supply, particularly given that the lion's share of titanium sponge imports come from Japan rather than potentially hostile China, which dominates many other critical mineral supply chains.
 It is clear from TIMET's Section 232 "Rebuttal Comments" that both titanium metal product producers such as ATI and Arconic and end-users such as Boeing were against any punitive measures that would in their eyes artificially raise the price of a readily available input.
 However, TIMET won the national security argument with the White House on the grounds that the sponge part of the titanium supply chain represents what the U.S Defense Department would classify as a potential "critical point of failure."
 It's all very well having lots of raw material on your door-step but 90% of the world's ilmenite gets diverted into the pigments industry.
 Converting raw material into titanium sponge prior to refining and casting is a specialized business to the point that the United States Geological Survey cites only six sponge producing countries outside the States: China, Japan, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and India.
 China and Russia, the largest and third-largest producers respectively, are increasingly problematic suppliers for U.S. defense contractors, meaning U.S. imports in 2018 were sourced almost exclusively from Japan and Kazakhstan.
 Sponge, moreover, is critical to many high-end titanium products. Although the titanium milling process generates lots of scrap that can be looped back into the production stream, many end-users specify a minimum input of primary material.
 Stockpiling might be one option but sponge degrades over time, according to TIMET, which argues its unique role in the U.S. supply chain ticks nearly all the "risk archetypes" identified by the Defense Department.
 PRODUCTION VERSUS PRICE
 The Trump administration agrees but seems to accept that tariffs would only damage an already struggling aviation manufacturing sector and upset a key political and economic ally.
 How then to square the circle of preserving domestic production capacity without penalizing Japanese imports?
 The Secretary of Defense is now supposed to be actively working on supporting domestic production capacity.
 A government-funded chlorination plant at Timet's Henderson facility has already been suggested. ATI's mothballed Rowley plant will also surely come under government review.
 But low-priced imports work against such investment.
 The Presidential Memorandum paves the way for talks with Japan on "measures to ensure access to titanium sponge in the United States."
 We don't know what those talks will encompass. The full Commerce Report on titanium sponge hasn't to date been made public.
 However, TIMET's submission to the report, which is publicly available, contains some intriguing possibilities.
 TIMET hasn't been calling for punitive tariffs but rather "believes the best solution would be achieved by implementing bilateral agreements with titanium sponge producing nations establishing reference prices for titanium sponge."
 The target would be "reference prices (…) that restored titanium sponge prices to 2013 levels," which would allow Henderson to keep operating and encourage Japanese producers to make required capital investments, according to TIMET.
 It claims that end-users such as Boeing could easily absorb higher prices for a product that is often only a blending input in the titanium production process.
 A bilateral agreement with Japan, which accounted for 94% of all U.S. imports in 2018, might be structured as a win-win if it allowed for a mutually- acceptable increase in prices over time.
 U.S. consumers could argue this would amount to tariffs by the back door but this administration has already shown it believes national security trumps markets.
 Titanium sponge will prove an interesting example of just how far it will go to secure its critical metals supplies.

Positive cases of coronavirus have popped up across Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and there’s one known case being treated in Bethlehem Township. The global pandemic has caused growing concern and precaution, and news of closures and postponements across the Lehigh Valley is slowly rolling in.


  Despite the steady rise of general anxiety about the virus, the local restaurant industry seems to be going mostly unscathed, business-wise. As of Thursday afternoon, many of the Valley’s most popular restaurants weren’t experiencing any smaller crowds than they typically would, and while they were taking precautionary measures to slow the spread, there was nothing to indicate business would be coming to a dramatic halt.


  “We’re just trying to roll with the punches — business as usual,” said Dave Adams, general manager at The Hamilton Kitchen and Bar. Adams said that the downtown Allentown restaurant had a normal business pattern and the staff was doing what it normally does with regards to sanitization.


  At The Bayou Southern Kitchen and Bar in Bethlehem, general manager Stephen Chicca has seen a few reservations canceled ahead of time, but that’s about it. Just to be safe, any restaurant employee that has to call out due to illness will not be allowed to return until seeing a doctor. “Even if you’re feeling slightly under the weather,” he said. “So far, it’s all been the common cold, thank God.”


  Chicca noted that anticipating a drop in business due to the virus would be hard to do based on this week, as the virus has only just made it to the Lehigh Valley, but it is something the restaurant is at least discussing.


  However, for now, “we’re plugging along just like normal.”


  Across the Lehigh River in South Bethlehem, Molly’s Irish Grille and Sports Pub owner Chaz Patrick walked into the bar Thursday with a case of bleach and a bunch of spray bottles, and the bar staff has been regularly sanitizing every surface. Patrick said he talked to his suppliers, and while beer and alcohol suppliers didn’t foresee any problems going forward, food suppliers said that, down the line, there could be issues with receiving food from California.


  But for now, Molly’s hasn’t seen any drop in business, and likely won’t through the weekend, as Saturday is St. Patrick’s Day.
