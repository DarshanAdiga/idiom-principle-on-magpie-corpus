So that's at least one familiar face for Stallworth on his new team. The backup nose tackle signed with the Saints as an undrafted rookie from South Carolina in 2018, playing well enough in the preseason to crack the 53-man roster and suit up for 14 games. In 2019, he transferred on and off of the practice squad as new additions like Malcom Brown and Shy Tuttle earned heavier workloads, making his presence a luxury for 2020 training camp.

As just one example, Democrats said Trump trampled the Constitution when he asserted emergency powers in order to divert billions of dollars to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. But most Republicans — including Sasse and all of the other GOP lawmakers from Nebraska and Iowa — stood with Trump and opposed a resolution reasserting congressional authority in that case.

A world reserve currency is supposed to be superior in storing value, but through boundless money-printing, the U.S. dollar hasn't been able to compete with gold by a long shot. In 1932 the gold price was $20.67 dollars per troy ounce, today it crossed 2,067 dollars. That's a 99% decline in the value of the dollar against gold.

The Minneapolis City Council passed in June a proposal to replace the police department with a Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention. However, residents must approve the city charter amendment before any changes are made, and they won’t see the issue on the ballot until at least 2021. So with no actual change in place, there is no tie of dismantling the police to homicide figures. As of Aug. 4, Minneapolis had seen 42 homicides in 2020 compared with 48 for all 2019.

What is not real is paper assets that are so easy to own and sell that they don't even write it down on paper anymore. The owners get digits typed into an electronic account. They don't even give certificates anymore for stocks. The brokerage firms hold the stocks, and you get a statement to an electronic device. Bastards don't even give paper monthly statements to say you own it. Banks don't have bank books anymore, just electronic blips on a screen, same with cryptocurrencies. It would be so easy for everything to disappear one day, not physical gold or silver.
