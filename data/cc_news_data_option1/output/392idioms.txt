JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind. (WDRB) -- Five of seven suspects, including two victims, are behind bars after an investigation into a shooting and robbery last week in southern Indiana.
 Jeffersonville Police say their Detective Division began investigating after responding to a reported shooting around 4 a.m. on Jan. 22 at a duplex in the 600 block of East Maple Street where police say the residents deal illegal narcotics.
 In a press conference Wednesday, Jeffersonville Police Detective Isaac Parker said the two men who live in the duplex, identified as James Hendrick and Clayton Pierce, sustained gunshot wounds and were transported to a local hospital where they received treatment for their injuries and were later released. Police said during their investigation, Hendrick and Pierce told officers that while they were using illegal narcotics with two females in the home, three men forced themselves inside and opened fire.
