As noted, the _2020AEW Full Gear_ pay-per-view has done roughly 100,000 buys, which is identical to the numbers garnered by _All Out_ back in September.
 According to Dave Meltzer on the latest Wrestling Observe Radio, the numbers are closer to what AEW higher-ups "were expecting" and the fact that they didn't set record numbers despite putting together "a great card on paper" didn't come as a surprise to anyone.
 Meltzer revealed that the buys for Full Gear, which was available on traditional PPV, FITE TV, and B/R Live, was "a little down in the U.S." but received a slight bump from overseas markets. He also noted that _2019 Full Gear_ , the first PPV after the premiere of _AEW Dynamite_ , "spooked" AEW management since it did really relatively low numbers [around 90,000].

 # TupaTalk: Remembering a January day in Dallas
 Mike Tupa
 Bartlesville Examiner-Enterprise
 While recently rummaging through a wrinkled, cockeyed stack of personal papers, my eyes fumbled over an old airline reservation.
 The date was Jan. 1, 1997.
 My weary mind puzzled over the itinerary — fly out to Dallas early in the morning and return to Bartlesville late that afternoon.
 Then, the recollection slapped my brain like a snapping wet towel.
 That was the day of The Link.
 Growing up, I never played baseball catch with my dad, although we might have flung a football back and forth once — the memory is hazy.
 Not that I was inclined otherwise, especially when, around age 12, I became interested in slamming softballs off the sides of neighbors houses or — to my mom's great delight — sending a line drive through one of our front windows.
 But, it takes two play catch.
 And one of us — and it wasn't me — was missing.
 Dad — a truck driver — had chosen a new highway in life to navigate and it didn't include stopping by more than once or twice a year to visit us.
 And, there was never much time during those abbreviated reunions to heave a ball around the yard.
 In a blitz of home-made tents in the front yard under the stars, Boy Scout summer camp, countless one-mile-plus treks to school each way each day, about a million paper route flicks of the wrist, summer days chasing bumblebees or climbing up the old apple trees in the uncared-for orchard out back, and trying out for the high school football team, childhood snuck away like a gentle dream fading in the dawn.
 When I was 18, my dad invited me on one of his truck hauls from Utah to the California coast. But, no time then to play catch or catch a ballgame — other then watch part on an old motel television part of the World Series.
 The years piled on top of each other.
 At one point it was at least five years — maybe eight — between face-to-face visits, although phone calls every few months kept us at voice distance.
 Then, I got a job in Bartlesville.
 My dad — who by then lived in Dallas — suggested during one of our chats I journey south to meet him at the 1997 Cotton Bowl, which featured Brigham Young (my favorite) team clashing with Kansas State.
 So, I made my reservation and — just past the middle of the night — drove that Jan. 1 morning to the Tulsa Airport, on a foggy morning.
 As we neared Dallas, the airplane intercom crackled out some bad news — due to the weather, the flight was being diverted to somewhere else in Texas.
 Needless to say, I felt like a wasp had just used my back for a dartboard.
 But, with a prayer and a hope, I managed to immediately catch a flight headed from that town back to Dallas.
 Of course, a lot of valuable time had been left behind in the air in the exhaust of the jet fumes.
 Finally landing in Dallas, I shared a taxi with a couple of guys going to the Cotton Bowl.
 By then, it was just about halftime. I checked at window for the ticket my dad said he'd have waiting for me. I think there was a mix-up there, as well.
 But, I got in and then somehow found the right seating section, which was right behind one of the end zones.
 By now, the halftime show had begun. I found my dad — who I hadn't seen for seven years, since he had flown in for my mom's funeral.
 Several other guys, either friends of my dad or relatives, sat around in the stands while we visited. Although not a BYU fan by choice, dad cheered that day for the Cougars as we watched the game for several minutes.
 Then, he and the guys with him decided to leave at the end of the third quarter, in order to beat the traffic jam. As I think back now, that was probably part of my fault, because of my outgoing flight in a couple of hours, or so.
 At the time, I remember trying to catch the words of the public announcer to keep up with the action while we walked out into the parking lot.
 Some of us went to a restaurant to eat and then dad drove me to the airport.
 Less than three hours later, I was home back in Bartlesville and trying to live the events of the remarkable day.
 It had required some decades — but I finally got to watch a game with my dad.
 Almost three years later, I flew back out to Dallas — this time for a last visit before the cancer that had taken custodian of a good chunk of his lungs — one of them had already been removed — finished its work.
 He was upbeat, happy, dressed in regular clothes and completely ambulatory as my sister — who had flown in from Utah — and I spent the afternoon with him. We watched on TV a Giants-Cowboys game, and then it was time for me to take a flight back to Bartlesville.
 A month later I flew back — this time into the San Antonio airport — to attend his services.
 Sometimes, destiny does have heart — I saw it on a sunny January day at a football game in Dallas.

"Each concert has a story," said Franz, who also will be doing the honors of introducing the pieces and explaining little known facts and tidbits about each one.
 "It's never just a concert," said principal cellist Brian Hodges. "Never," seconded Dawn Douthit, concertmaster.
 The virtual concert events were filmed at the Morrison Center during the first week of November, with social distancing, sanitizing and mask wearing for all but those playing wind instruments, although they did wear face masks until the moment they began playing. Other safety precautions included air cleaning breaks every 60 minutes and HEPA filters. "We were as safe as we possibly could be," said Franz.
 "We were so delighted to make music," Douthit said. Stationed precisely 6 feet apart, they were able to find the sweet spot. "And we could hear each other," said Douthit, "it felt close to a real concert experience."
 Playing in a venue before a live audience is the preferred way — "there's a certain energy in the air with a live audience," said Franz. But, in light of being in the midst of a pandemic, "this is where we're at," Hodges said. "This is the best we can do."
