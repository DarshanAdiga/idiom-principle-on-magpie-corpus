It is quite annoying. The company had an incredibly clean balance sheet, $7.7 billion in cash and $4 billion in debt. There is no excuse for failing to do even a few hundred million. The only thing that could have conceivably kept them from pulling the trigger is a potential acquisition of some size. Maybe the Tik-Tok thing. But if that's the case, management has been chasing a ridiculous and unpractical acquisition instead of buying back its own deeply undervalued shares ~80% lower. That's the acquisition I want them to make.
 At the end of January, the standstill agreement with Elliott Associates ends. Overall, the business is improving rapidly. But I can imagine the activist would like to install another CEO after Dorsey had multiple runs at it and is still getting regularly upstaged by Pinterest (PINS) and Snapchat (SNAP) instead of being in the social media O.G. constellation of a Facebook (FB), LinkedIn (MSFT) or even Instagram.
 CEO Dorsey is also getting a lot of flack for his beard with which he testified before a Senate panel on moderation of free speech. I think the ridicule of his beard is preposterous. It's a great look! Okay, we can agree to disagree on that.
 But we all know it isn't right to go by someone's looks. It is illustrative that Dorsey is getting this flack and I believe it is because Twitter under Dorsey has been an underwhelming story. Successful CEOs can afford to be eccentric. Former T-Mobile (TMUS) CEO Legere appeared in the senate in a trademark magenta t-shirt, jacket, no tie, and with long hair. What's he doing anyway?
 Finally, I think Dorsey is on an unpromising course with Twitter's moderation of certain tweets. The company started pursuing a solution that isn't scalable and burdens the company with an enormous responsibility it can only fall short of fulfilling. The last thing the platform should aspire to be is to become the arbiter of truth. But I could be wrong about that and I don't believe the success of Twitter depends on it.
 I've added to my Twitter position at $44.48. I think the company is on the right course overall. There could be catalysts in a leadership change and importantly with Covid resurfacing to an alarming degree, Twitter is reasonably positioned because it did well during quarantine and served as an important go-to information source.

KINGSPORT - Ruth Cline Montgomery, of Kingsport, passed away at her home on Thursday, October 29, 2020. She was 92.
 Mrs. Montgomery was born December 31, 1927, in Johnson City, Tennessee. She was the daughter of the late Loy C. and Charlotte (Lottie) Starnes Cline. She was preceded in death by her husband of 57 years, Dr. Robert H. Montgomery.
 She was a graduate of Science Hill High School and East Tennessee State University where she was initiated into Phi Kappa Phi. In 1952, she received her master’s degree from the College of Business at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. She taught business subjects at Dobyns-Bennett High School and Clinton High School in the 1950s. She was honored as ETSU’s 1988 Outstanding Alumna and is a member of the College of Business Hall of Fame.
 In 1972, she was elected to the Sullivan County Quarterly Court, now the Sullivan County Commission. During her 8 years on the Commission, she served as chair of the Executive Committee and the Sullivan County Youth Home. In 1980, she was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives where she represented the Kingsport area for four terms. She served as assistant House minority leader. In 1988, she was elected to a term in the Tennessee Senate where she represented Sullivan County. While in the Senate, she served as secretary of the Health and Welfare committee and as a member of the Rules Committee and the Fiscal Review Committee. After her retirement from the General Assembly, Mrs. Montgomery was elected Mayor of the City of Kingsport. She served two terms and retired from public service in 1999.
 She was active in her community, state, and nation.

Potentially lost in the shuffle of Julian Edelman undergoing a knee procedure on Thursday that will sideline him for the foreseeable future was fellow Patriots star Stephon Gilmore popping up on the injury report. New England officially listed the reigning Defensive Player of the Year as a limited participant in practice due to a knee injury and now we're getting a bit more clarity on the situation. Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network reports that Gilmore tweaked his knee during Thursday's session and underwent an MRI after practice. The injury is deemed minor, but Gilmore's status for Sunday's pivotal matchup against the Buffalo Bills is not clear at this point.
 At 2-4 on the season and in third place in the AFC East, New England will need this game to keep pace in the division and cling onto any hope of making a playoff push. Not having Gilmore in the fold for such a matchup to likely square up against Bills star receiver Stefon Diggs would be ill-timed, to say the least. While Gilmore has taken a step back from his DPOY form from a season ago, he's still one of the better corners that the league has to offer and would help to slow down Diggs, who has 603 yards receiving and three touchdowns coming into this contest.
 This season, Gilmore has totaled 20 tackles, two passes defended, an interception, and a forced fumble.

Toyota is pleased to announce their support of the new NASCAR Cup Series team 23XI Racing, which is co-owned by NBA legend Michael Jordan and current NASCAR Cup Series championship contender Denny Hamlin. 23XI Racing will make its debut in the 2021 Daytona 500 with Bubba Wallace behind the wheel of the No. 23 Toyota Camry. The partnership with Toyota Motor North America (TMNA) includes support from Toyota Racing Development, U.S.A. (TRD), who will build the team's engines and provide technology, data and technical assistance. “We are excited to be a part of this new team with Michael, Denny and Bubba,” said Ed Laukes, Group Vice President of Toyota Division Marketing at TMNA. “As a Chicago native, I saw firsthand Michael’s determination as he led his team to multiple NBA championships. I know he brings that same drive and work ethic to this new opportunity. Denny has been a valuable part of the Toyota family for over a decade and we are happy to support him as he takes the next step into NASCAR team ownership. We are also thrilled to bring Bubba back to the Toyota family. Bubba achieved many firsts with Toyota, and we are counting on him earning many more victories with 23XI Racing behind the wheel of a Camry.” The Toyota relationship will also incorporate an agreement with Joe Gibbs Racing (JGR) to allow 23XI Racing to purchase chassis and other services. As is the case with many other Toyota and TRD teams within the NASCAR garages, technical information and communication amongst the teams will be encouraged to help improve performance across the Toyota and TRD family of teams and drivers. “We’re excited to have the opportunity to provide resources to this new Toyota team to help them get started,” said Joe Gibbs, owner of Joe Gibbs Racing. “We can remember being in a similar position nearly three decades ago and we were fortunate to have a similar agreement that helped us in the beginning. We’re happy for Denny to realize his dream of ownership and certainly it’s a big deal for NASCAR to have someone with the respect and stature of Michael Jordan enter our sport.” A lifelong NASCAR fan, Jordan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009. He played 13 seasons for the Chicago Bulls, leading them to six NBA Championships. In 2010, he became the majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets (then Bobcats) and is the first former player to become the majority owner of an NBA franchise. “My main goal for 23XI Racing is to be competitive for a championship as soon as possible,” said Jordan. “Our partnership with Toyota and Joe Gibbs Racing gives us the equipment, resources and expertise to do it.” Hamlin has been a vital part of the Toyota family for over a decade. Since first climbing behind the wheel of a Camry in 2008, Hamlin has scored 41 victories, three Daytona 500 wins and has finished in the top-10 in the point standings 10 times. He has earned seven victories this season and has advanced to the Round of 8 as he pursues his first NASCAR Cup Series title. “Toyota has been a big part of my NASCAR career,” said Hamlin. “We’ve achieved multiple milestones together including back-to-back Daytona 500 victories. I know how they support their teams, and when I decided move to team ownership, I knew that I wanted Toyota to be alongside our team. Toyota supports my vision with this team and will be integrated with our team members to support us as we grow and strive to achieve race wins and championships.” 23XI Racing marks a return to the Toyota family for Bubba Wallace. Wallace first joined Toyota in 2011 as a part of Rev Racing in what’s now the ARCA Menards Series East. As a 17-year-old, he drove to three wins and a runner-up finish in the point standings. In 2012, he joined Joe Gibbs Racing and made his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut, scoring a top-10 finish. From 2013-2014, Wallace competed in the Truck Series with Kyle Busch Motorsports (KBM), including becoming the first African-American to win in NASCAR in nearly 40 years when he drove to victory at Martinsville Speedway in October 2013. Wallace added four additional victories and two top-10 finishes in the final point standings in his tenure with KBM. The No. 23 Toyota Camry will make its debut in the 2021 Daytona 500 and join fellow Toyota teams, Joe Gibbs Racing and Gaunt Brothers Racing, in the Great American Race on February 14, 2021.

That being said, with oil trading in the low-$30s to high-$40s a barrel range and with declining levels of capital expenditures, I think Callon Petroleum will likely generate free cash flows. Note that the company's CapEx budget was tilted towards the first quarter and is forecasted to decline by 58.7% to nearly $150 million in H2-2020 (or just $75 million per quarter). Callon Petroleum expects to generate a total of $150 million of free cash flows in the second half of the current year through the end of 2021 in a $40 a barrel oil price environment. The WTI oil price, however, could end up averaging around $45 a barrel in 2021, as per the US Energy Information Administration's estimate. Therefore, I expect Callon Petroleum to generate more than $150 million of free cash flows through YE-2021. The excess cash flows will likely further strengthen the company's liquidity in the future.
 Although Callon Petroleum is moving in the right direction, it still has a long way to go. As mentioned earlier, the company carries high levels of debt. The above-mentioned transactions have improved its liquidity but they likely didn't push the total debt, which was $3.35 billion at the end of the second quarter, meaningfully lower. That's because, on one hand, the company repaid roughly $450 million of funds borrowed from the revolver but on the other hand, it also issued $300 million of notes. This shows a net decrease of $150 million, which is just 4.5% of the total debt. Besides, the company likely generated free cash flows in the third quarter but with oil trading near $40s a barrel, it couldn't have generated enough excess cash that could push debt significantly lower. Therefore, I think Callon Petroleum likely ended the third quarter with a stretched balance sheet, possibly similar to the second quarter.
 Therefore, I think Callon Petroleum still has a lot of work to do. I believe the free cash flows alone will not be enough to finance a big debt repayment. Moving forward, Callon Petroleum will have to close more deals - which may include asset sales, joint ventures, and sale of royalty interest - and raise substantial cash in the process which will drive debt reduction. The good thing, however, is that the company doesn't have any significant near-term debt maturities, with the earliest notes maturing in April 2023. Callon Petroleum has ample breathing room to devise a debt reduction plan. The management seems focused on improving the company's financial health. The recent transactions have shown that even during difficult periods, the company can monetize assets. This should give confidence to investors about the company's ability to bring down its debt in the near-term.

I think the short form of the answer is yes, with the following color to it. We've been talking for quite some time about the fact that the digital assets, whether it's data or software, are becoming a bigger part of the value that is created for our clients. And so – and we've been part of this digital transformation that is sweeping through the federal government. And the government and DoD, in particular, are trying to think hard about how to procure these types of capabilities and these types of assets in a way that they can do it faster, more reliably, and more repeatedly because these moves are digital speed. And I think Booz Allen is, honestly, maybe really modestly, doing a great job across the board, not just in terms of coming up with our own proprietary solutions by partnering with other technology firms to make sure that their proprietary solutions can actually add mission value. It's this intersection of mission and technology where we excel, is the ability to take not just one piece of software or one technology, but a portfolio to solve a meaningful mission problem, whether it is a cyber defense of critical infrastructure, whether it is using AI to improve customer service, or to improve intelligence production.

Quickley is one of the very best in this class, as he made 42.8% from 3-point range last season at Kentucky and made 90% of his free-throw attempts in two collegiate seasons. This is probably close to his floor, because guards with his skill set are tough to find in this draft.
