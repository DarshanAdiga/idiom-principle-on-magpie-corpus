 PLACE 5
   
 Early voting results show in Place 5, incumbent Temeika Thomas, 38, a first grade teacher, is leading with 70.3% of the vote, over former Manor Superintendent Royce Avery, who garnered 29.7% of the vote.
   
 If reelected, Thomas said her priorities include giving educator and staff raises while improving working conditions, as well as improving individual student achievement.
   
 Avery, 54, left the district earlier this year after some of the trustees on the board last year pushed to remove him as superintendent. If elected, he said he wants to develop and support community engagement, encourage community involvement and business partnerships. and encourage fellow board members to adhere to board policy, stay within the guidelines of board duties and responsibilities.
   
 In Place 6, early voting results show incumbent Monique Celedon, 50, a real estate agent, has garnered 71.9% of the vote. Austin Community College student Bryan Nya, 22 earned 28.1% of the early vote.
   
 If reelected, Celedon said she wants to provide equitable education to all students, enhance community engagement and continue to support the new district police department included in the recent bond. Nya wants to expand education opportunities, advocate for teachers and employ strategies that advance the equitable treatment of students and better prepare all students for life after high school.
   
 In Place 7, early voting totals show incumbent Janie Serna, 60, is leading with 59.8% of the vote over challenger Felix Paiz, 39, a small business owner, who has garnered 40.2% of the vote. Serna, who works with juveniles in the criminal justice system, said she wants to ensure all campuses have a nurse and all staff is trained and ready and have the necessary supplies for the next six to eight months amid the coronvirus pandemic. Paiz said he wants to improve communication, teacher retention and community trust and improve teacher retention through competitive pay, incentives, opportunities for growth and supporting them in the classroom.

When the New Zealand Rugby Union took the unilateral decision to pull the plug on Super Rugby, it left South African-based players without a competition to play in. By the time the revised Rugby Championship came around last month, domestic matches had only just resumed. The Springboks' sports scientists decreed that players needed to have played a minimum of 400 minutes to be ready for international competition. Only Sale’s Faf de Klerk and one other player had played the requisite amount. The rest had played around 200 minutes. So South Africa pulled out.

Before Tuesday’s vote, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission listed Precinct 2 as a partially wet area — a region where certain types of alcoholic beverage sales are legal in some areas but not in others.
 Bell County Judge David Blackburn previously explained how alcohol sales laws are determined based on the precinct lines at the time of a local option election.
 “So the simple question of whether or not all precincts are authorized for the legal sale of beer and wine (for) off-premises consumption only really isn’t a simple question because by state alcohol beverage code law it’s tied to the JP precinct lines — and those JP precinct lines change over the years,” Blackburn said. “If one was not authorized, one was authorized and lines changed, you could have slivers or pockets here and there where it is not permitted as a result of that.”
 Buda-based Texas Petition Strategies organized a 264-page petition calling for the matter to appear on ballots for voters in Salado, Bartlett, Holland and some unincorporated areas of southeast Bell County.
 The local option easily landed on ballots, as Texas state law requires local option petitions to garner 35 percent of the registered voters in JP Precinct 2.
 In August, then-Elections Administrator Melinda Luedecke said about 96 percent of Texas Petition Strategies’ collected signatures were valid.
 “According to the last gubernatorial election and those who voted in JP 2, to get this on the ballot for November, they were required to have 1,977 signatures for that issue to be placed on the ballot. … So the 2,216 exceeded that minimum requirement,” Luedecke, who resigned from her position on Sept. 8, said.
 Bell County Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 faced a similar election in 2015, when Belton-area voters also were tasked with whether to allow beer and wine sales at two stores in an unincorporated area. Texas Petition Strategies was hired to spearhead that petition.
 At the time, the referendum applied to two stores outside the city limits of Belton and Morgan’s Point Resort: the Cefco at 5337 FM 439, and the Dollar General at 3648 Broken Bow Road. Before that petition, the last local liquor option election for Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 was in 1947.

Improving soil health increases soil biological activity, which provides erosion control, nutrient benefits, and can simulate tillage. According to Champaign County no-till farmer and former President of the Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts Steve Stierwalt, “We’ve got a lot of great conservation farmers in Illinois who are using no-till and working with cover crops and I am so thankful for all they’re doing to impact our natural resources. Truth is, we need more farmers to embrace these new and profitable ways of production agriculture. They work for me and they’ll work for you too.”

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Control of the Senate is a razor-close proposition in Tuesday's election, as Republicans fight to retain their majority against a surge of Democratic candidates confronting the president's allies across a vast political map.
   
 Both parties see paths to victory, and the outcome might not be known on election night.
   
 From New England to the Deep South, the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican senators are defending seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats. Washington's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, the economic fallout and the nation's uneasy mood are all on the ballot. Stunning amounts of cash have been flowing to Democrats from millions of Americans apparently voting with their pocketbooks; Republicans are tapping deep-pocketed donors to shore up GOP senators.
   
 President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden swooped in on key states important to the Senate as they propelled their own campaigns in a final stretch.
   
 Securing the Senate majority will be vital for the winner of the presidency. Senators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda. With Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.
   
 "Let's run through the tape," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, making a final campaign swing Monday in Kentucky as he faces Democratic former fighter pilot Amy McGrath.
   
 McConnell said he hoped to remain the Republican majority leader alongside Trump. But he acknowledged the tough Senate races could flip control to the Democrats. "Obviously, that depends on what happens," he said.
   
 The campaigns are competing across an expansive Senate map as Democrats put Republicans on defense deep into Trump country.
   
 What started as a lopsided election cycle with Republicans defending 23 Senate seats, compared with 12 for Democrats, quickly became a starker referendum on the president and his party.
   
 Some of the nation's most well-known senators are in the fights of their political lives.
   
 In South Carolina, Democrat Jaime Harrison is trying to topple GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the president's top allies.
   
 The two crisscrossed the state in a rush of final campaigning, Graham acknowledging the tight contest after Harrison raised a whopping $100 million by October, an unheard-of sum for the state. The senator, making TV appeals for cash, said he, too, hit the $100 million mark over the weekend.
   
 Stuck in Washington to confirm Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett a week before Election Day, senators quickly fanned out -- some alongside the president -- for last-ditch tours, often socially distanced in the pandemic, to shore up votes.
   
 GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina joined Trump's rally in Fayetteville on Monday as he struggled to fend off Democrat Cal Cunningham despite the married challenger's sexting scandal with a public relations strategist.
   
 In one of the most-watched races in the nation, Maine GOP Sen. Susan Collins made a final campaign stop in Aroostook County near her hometown, visiting workers in a sawmill. Democratic challenger Sara Gideon met voters at the Whistle Stop cafe for breakfast Monday.
   
 The Maine race is one of several that could push past Election Day if no candidate breaks the 50% threshold. Collins has typically rallied support as a centrist with an independent streak, but the tight contest shows the difficulty GOP senators have appealing to Trump's most ardent backers while also retaining support from more moderate voters.
   
 Democrats have more than one route to secure the three or four seats needed to capture the majority, and GOP strategists privately conceded the incumbents will almost certainly suffer defeats in some key races.
   
 Younger voters and more minorities are pushing some states toward Democrats. In Colorado, the parties have essentially stopped spending money for or against GOP Sen. Cory Gardner because it seems he is heading toward defeat by Democrat John Hickenlooper, a former governor.
   
 Arizona could see two Democratic senators for the first time since last century if former astronaut Mark Kelly maintains his advantage over GOP Sen. Martha McSally for the seat once held by the late Republican John McCain.
   
 Even the open seat in Kansas, which hasn't elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1932, is being contested.
   
 "The better President Trump does in a state, the easier it is to win any race," said Corry Bliss, a GOP strategist.
   
 The biggest risks to Democrats come in Alabama and Michigan.
   
 Republicans are expecting to reclaim the seat in Alabama, where Democratic Sen. Doug Jones pulled off a rare 2017 special election win in the Trump stronghold but now wages an uphill campaign against Republican Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn football coach.
   
 In the presidential battleground of Michigan, Republicans have made an aggressive push for John James, a Black Republican businessman, as he rakes in cash to take on Democratic Sen. Gary Peters.
   
 "We think the numbers are moving," said Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law.
   
 Still, voter turnout during the COVID-19 crisis remains key, and volatile, as more Americans than ever -- nearing 100 million -- cast early ballots.
   
 Both Biden and Trump touched down in Georgia, where the state is seeing a boost of new voters. Georgia's two Senate seats are at stake and could very well push to a Jan. 5 runoff if no candidate reaches beyond the 50% threshold.
   
 GOP Sen. David Perdue, the former business executive Trump calls his favorite senator, is working to fend off Democrat Jon Ossoff, another candidate who has benefited from the "green wave" of donations.
   
 Separately, GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler faces Republican Rep. Doug Collins, as well as Democrat Raphael Warnock, in a special election for the seat she was appointed to fill with the retirement of GOP Sen. Johnny Isakson.
   
 It's expected to be a long count in races across the country.
   
 The political landscape is quickly changing from six years ago, when most of these senators last faced voters. It's a reminder of how sharply the political climate has shifted in the Trump era.
   
 In Montana, Republican Sen. Steve Daines is trying to brush back Democrat Steve Bullock, the governor, in a state where Trump was popular. Democrats created an opening by working hard to recruit a well-known candidate in Bullock, who also ran in the party's primary for president.
   
 Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst is fighting for a second term against Democrat Theresa Greenfield. Texas Sen. John Cornyn faces an upstart Democrat, MJ Hegar, in the once solidly Republican state.
   
 And in Alaska, newcomer Al Gross, a doctor, has broken state fundraising records in part with viral campaign ads as he challenges GOP Sen. Dan Sullivan.

“We are so grateful tonight that the voice of Montana has been heard loud and clear,” Daines said to a crowd of supporters around midnight outside the Hilton Garden Inn in Bozeman.
 Daines headlined a big night for Republicans in the state as Rep. Greg Gianforte won the gubernatorial race and Auditor Matt Rosendale won Montana’s lone U.S. House seat.
 Bullock conceded and congratulated Daines in a statement.
 "I ran for office 12 years ago with one goal in mind: to make a meaningful difference in people’s lives," Bullock said. "I have been so pleased with how we have been able to bring people together in Montana — even when we don’t always agree — to improve the lives of our families and our communities."
 The race could help determine which party holds the Senate majority come January. Going into election night, Republicans held with 53 seats and 35 were up for grabs, with Montana’s race considered among the most competitive in the country.
 “By winning this race tonight, we have saved the United States Senate from Chuck Schumer,” Daines said.
 Daines will continue serving alongside Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.
 As Democrats sought to flip the seat and money flooded into the race, advertisements ramped up in recent weeks and months.
 “Now, elections, they’ll be over tonight. The TV ads will stop. Your mailboxes will be free again,” Daines said. “And then it’s time to get together and come together as Montanans and as Americans to work to address the challenges we face.”

You do what the coaches sent but very quickly I decided to set up something additional for myself.


--DocBreak--
Throughout the campaign, Daines criticized Bullock, saying he’d vote in line with other Democrats in the Senate and calling him too liberal for Montana. Like he did at many campaign stops, Daines again pointed to his vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on Tuesday night.
 He also promoted his support for the Second Amendment, pro-life policies and lower taxes.
 “Montana is a very special place,” Daines said. “Like you, I want to keep it that way.”
 Daines aligned his campaign with President Donald Trump, who he held a phone rally with, and held a rally with Vice President Mike Pence in Belgrade in September. At the rally with Pence, Daines discussed his support for the energy industry and law enforcement. He’s also campaigned with Sens. Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio, Nikki Haley, Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, and Donald Trump Jr.
 Daines worked for Proctor & Gamble and RightNow Technologies before entering politics.
 On Monday, the state already shattered its previous turnout record of 516,901 for votes cast in an election with lots more flooding in Tuesday. The candidates were expected to spend about a combined $200 per registered voter, according to the Associated Press. As of mid-day Tuesday, nearly 750,000 voters registered, another record.
 Both campaigns anticipated a close race entering Tuesday.
 Bullock campaigned heavily on health care, public lands, education and campaign finance reform. He’s said he worked with politicians from both parties as governor, a style he hoped to bring to Washington D.C.
 Bullock is termed out as governor. He joined the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in March 2019, said he wouldn’t run for Senate and then dropped out of the presidential race in December. On the last possible day to enter the Senate race in March of this year, he jumped in.
 In 2016, Bullock won reelection as governor even as Trump won Montana by 20 points. Before becoming governor, Bullock was Montana’s attorney general for four year and practiced law before that.
 Bullock has led Montana through the coronavirus pandemic, creating the state’s reopening plan but remaining in phase two of that plan since June even as cases spiked in recent weeks.
 When Daines addressed the crowd, first at 10 p.m. before results were known and again after he won, his supporters chanted, “Six more years.” He waved back to them and left the stage.

This gives Buckley, 54, his second term in the state House.
 Williams did not respond to a Telegram request to comment.
 In 2018, Buckley won his first term with 53.8 percent of the vote to Democrat Kathy Richerson’s 46.2 percent; 48,394 people cast a ballot in that race.
 Williams, 47, was aiming to become the first Democrat to represent District 54 since 1994. The district was one of 22 seats Texas Democrats targeted in an attempt to take control of the House.
 The Republican Party has kept this seat in its column since Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a survivor of the 1991 Luby’s shooting in Killeen, was elected in 1996.
 Williams, an Army veteran, led in Bell County. She had 51.5 percent of the vote to Buckley’s 48.5 percent, according to unofficial figures from the Bell County Elections Department.
 That 3-point margin was not enough to overcome Buckley’s blowout in Lampasas County. He won it with 81.8 percent of the vote to Williams’ 18.2 percent, according to the Texas Secretary of State.
 Two years ago, Buckley won 80.9 percent of Lampasas voters.
 The race for District 54 was heated in the weeks leading up to Election Day. Both candidates aired commercials on television and online to motivate voters to get to the polls. Hundreds of thousands of dollars flooded both candidates’ coffers.

Biden's Response to Laptop Bombshell Shows How Out of the Loop He Really Is

The Assembly already has enough Democratic votes to surmount a veto imposed by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. "If both chambers of the Legislature can do whatever they want and tell the governor to take a hike, they will," Sheinkopf predicted
 Should Democrats end up with a net gain of just two seats in the Senate, it could provide the cushion that progressive members of that party need to advance tax legislation that would require the state's highest income earners to pay more state taxes. Cuomo has frowned on higher taxes for the rich, arguing such a move would likely drive some of the state's most affluent residents to relocate.
 Republicans were trying to harness voter displeasure with recent changes to the bail law to knock out several incumbent Senate Democrats in swing district seats, getting support and an infusion of campaign cash from police unions and their allies. While the GOP stood little chance of winning back the majority, they were trying to reverse some of the damage they suffered in the 2018 cycle, when a "blue wave" surge at the polls left Albany's Republicans in tatters.
 The 2018 results helped pave the way for legislation that ended cash bail for non-violent crimes, restricting the ability of judges to send defendants awaiting trial to jail. Republicans argue the new law has been a public safety fiasco.
 Katie Schaffer, with the advocacy group Center for Community Alternatives, called the GOP attacks on the latest bail legislation "racist rhetoric and blatant falsehoods."
 "In New York and across the country, racial justice and human decency require a continued commitment to dismantling systems of mass incarceration and investing in what communities truly need to thrive," Schaffer said.
 Senate GOP Leader Rob Ortt, R-North Tonawanda, campaigned on behalf of Republican candidates who have denounced the bail law revision, such as Mike Martucci, who challenged Sen. Jen Metzger, D-Rosendale, for a seat that previously was long held by a Republican, John Bonacic.
 One day earlier, Ortt and police union activists rallied GOP voters on Long Island, a key battleground region, tweeting that Republicans are prepared to "restore sanity in Albany."
 Though more than 3.5 million New Yorkers opted to participate in early voting options or asked for absentee ballots due to concerns with the COVID-19 pandemic, steady lines were still reported on Election Day at numerous polling stations.

Republicans extended their White House winning streak in Alabama as President Donald Trump carried the state against Democrat Joe Biden and claimed nine electoral votes.
 The GOP has won Alabama in every presidential election since 1976, when Jimmy Carter from neighboring Georgia was on the ballot, and the outcome was hardly in doubt this year given Republicans hold every statewide office but one, as well as large majorities in both houses of the Legislature.
 While issues like impeachment and the coronavirus pandemic threatened Trump nationally, none of that seemed to matter in Alabama. Some Republican candidates campaigned on little more than supporting Trump for a second term.

Just like the rest of 2020, we're about to have an unprecedented Election Day.
 Election Day 2020 is really more like Election Week (or, God forbid, Election Month), thanks to the large number of mail-in ballots cast because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike years past, it's unlikely we'll be able to call a winner Tuesday evening in the presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. And beyond the time it takes to count the ballots, legal battles could follow results - lawyers have already lined up across the nation to challenge voting rules and individual votes.
 It is, quite frankly, overwhelming just to vote this year, let alone follow every election update and news development. We want to help you take care of your mental health while you stay informed.
 If you've already voted (and if you haven't voted yet, visit USA TODAY's voter resources page for help), we offer some wisdom, distractions and comfort in what is going to be a stressful week for everyone.
 Be patient, if you can
 We live in an impatient society. We want everything right now (two-day shipping! instant downloads!) and having to wait longer to find out the results of what has felt like an extra-long election cycle can be stressful.
 But preparing yourself for a long haul can help make this week easier. As USA TODAY editor-in-chief Nicole Carroll put it, "The number of mail-in and absentee ballots in many states means counting could go on for days. The delay doesn't mean there is a problem. It means the system is working, and states are ensuring every ballot is counted."
 Limit your news consumption to what you need to know
 You don't need to be glued to your phone or TV screen to ensure you hear important election news.
 "There is a fine line between being an informed citizen and making yourself crazy with all the headlines and social media conversations," says Dr. Linda Anegawa, a primary care physician with virtual health platform PlushCare. "These activities can become not only a time suck, but it can drain your emotional energy."
 If you aren't learning anything new and you are feeling anxious, it's probably a sign you need a break.
 Do something else
 It's OK to spend time this week taking care of your mental health. In fact, it's extra-important to do so when the news is stressful.
 "These are challenging times for us all, so it's critical that we care for our emotional and physical health more than ever," says Anegawa. "It's important that we all fortify ourselves in every sense of the word."
 Mediation, mindfulness, distraction and entertainment can help us relax during this crazy week. Here are some ways you might channel your jittery energy into a non-election activity:
 You can watch one of the best shows on Netflix. Or Hulu. Or Amazon. Or HBO Max. Or Peacock. There is so much TV at your fingertips ready for a distracting binge-watch.
 If you would rather watch a movie than commit to a TV show, here are film critic Brian Truitt's favorites from 2020 (so far). For a kid-friendly option, try one of these 25 great movies.
 Still need a movie? Try one of our 100 favorites. There's bound to be one on the list that you'll love.
 Or maybe you're more of a reader. There's nothing like curling up with a good book. Try downloading one of these top 20 for fall.
 Sam Smith, Bon Jovi and Dolly Parton all released new music in October. Spend some time zoning out with your headphones.
 Start your holiday shopping. There are plenty of sales already starting, but may we suggest one of these 15 products that will help with stress relief. Maybe you need them for yourself. Maybe you need them right now.
 If you don't want to spend money right now, you could also try your hand at DIYing some of these fall fashion trends at home without shopping.
 Plan your safe Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other medical experts have cautioned against big family get-togethers, but that doesn't mean Thanksgiving won't be festive. Special menus (maybe try Cornish game hens instead of a turkey), Zoom calls with your family, crafts and more can make your Thanksgiving special.
 Stress bake. It's time-consuming, fun and oh-so-tasty. We have recipes for beginners, moderate bakers and experts here. And if you are interested in bread and want it fast, here are some bread recipes that don't require yeast.
 Meditate. If you've never tried meditation before, here are some tips for getting started.
 We recently spoke to some astronauts about how they handle anxiety and isolation. Here are five tips they have for taking care of your mental health.
 Sleep. Daylight saving time is hard enough to adjust to without staying up too late.
 2020 has been trying for all of us. Do whatever you can to stay well during this crazy week in this crazy year. And if you need more support, USA TODAY's newsletter Staying Apart, Together is dedicated to helping you cope with the pandemic and other stressors in your life. It always has a cute pet picture. You can sign up here.
 And don't worry, the election will still be there when you turn back to the news. Follow USA TODAY's coverage for accurate, up-to-date results and analysis.

"As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster," Trump said at the first presidential debate on Sept. 29. "They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud.

Some people just need more time outside if they experience Seasonal Affective Disorder, Zatopek said, but there are other ways to identify and help with symptoms.
 Since the disorder is a type of major depression, the symptoms are similar: mild to severe feelings of sadness most or all of the time; feeling tired or fatigued despite sleeping more than usual; and a feeling of being purposeless, restless, agitated or having difficulty concentrating.
 An easy way to treat seasonal depression is to try spending time outside. If you feel refreshed afterwards, or just a little better than normal, it may be a sign your symptoms are seasonal.
 Zatopek said doctors in Japan prescribe walks in the forest before antidepressants to try and help regulate the body and increase vitamin D.
 “Brain science research shows that we actually — human beings — respond really positively to going out in nature,” Zatopek said. “That means looking outside, looking at trees, looking at the ground, looking at the sky.”
 Langley said something that helps her is to just begin writing, projecting her feelings into a story or character.
 She also recommended visiting CAPS because every student gets six free therapy sessions a semester, and she found them helpful. It’s helpful to remember that not every suggestion they give works for everyone.
 For example, Langley personally finds it helpful to remove all electronic distractions and just lay in the dark for a while, but she can see how that might stress some people out.
 If you can’t find the time to go outside, there are also light therapy lamps available online that mimic sunlight, Zatopek said.
 “That can help stimulate the body's production of serotonin,” she said. “We need a good balance of that between that and melatonin.”
 The lamps produce light at 10,000 lux (a light intensity measurement), the amount needed to help vitamin D production artificially. However, individuals with bipolar disorder should be aware that this method has been known to cause agitation, Zatopek said.
 Most people experience seasonal depression to some degree, so increasing contact with the outdoors is a good reminder, Zatopek said.
 Try to avoid having plans or activities, if you can, to get the full calming experience outside. If your symptoms worsen, consult a doctor or therapist immediately.

Sarah McBride has made history, becoming the first transgender person in the U.S. to be elected to a state Senate seat.
 McBride, 30, will represent the area where she grew up in District 1, which encompasses Claymont, Bellefonte, and part of Wilmington. The seat was previously held for decades by Harris McDowell, who did not run for re- election.
 Though her election is a landmark moment, McBride, in an interview on election night, told WDEL her identity never came up in conversations with voters.
 "Because I was focused on...the issues that matter to me neighbors and this community--issues of health care, education, good-paying jobs with real benefits like paid family and medical leaves, the need for criminal justice reform, and so from the start of this campaign, I've been focused on the issues that I know are keeping so many people in this community up at night; they're the issues that have kept me up at night," she said.
 She said Tuesday night's results show voters aren't casting their ballots based on identity.
 "They're judging candidates based on what they bring to the table, on their ideas, on their experience, and they're looking for a hopeful, positive inclusive message that really tackles the issues most to them," she said.
 However, McBride understands her election will be an inspiration to the LGBTQ community.
 "I didn't run to make history to make headlines. I ran to make a difference in this community, but I am mindful that the results this evening could send a really hopeful and comforting message to a young person, here in Delaware or potentially somewhere else, who's trying to figure out how they fit into this world, who's struggling with their place in this world, that this democracy is big enough for them--that their voice matters. That tonight we could send that message that could be potentially, not just life-affirming, but life-changing and life-saving. I know how much of a difference it would have made for me, as a kid, to have seen something like this."

Warnock gained the backing of Democratic leaders including former President Barack Obama. That helped clear the field for Warnock on the Democratic side while Loeffler and Collins battled it out on the right.
 Either Loeffler or Warnock will serve the rest of Isakson's term. The seat goes on the ballot again in 2022.
 Democrats haven't won a Senate race in Georgia in two decades. But ongoing population growth around Atlanta and shifting demographics that have made the state less white -- along with dissatisfaction with Trump in the suburbs -- have helped fuel hope among Democrats that the state is in play.
 Both sides poured huge amounts of money into the races, and record numbers of people cast ballots early, some facing hourslong lines. Georgia has also seen a large increase in absentee ballots cast by mail.
 Perdue, a former business executive and a close Trump ally, faces Ossoff, a documentary film producer who launched his political career with an unsuccessful 2017 run for Congress. Their race has been characterized by sharp attacks but relatively moderate political positions.
 Perdue has sought to cast Ossoff as backing a "radical socialist agenda," while Ossoff has portrayed Perdue as a "corrupt" Washington insider.
 Loeffler and Collins, a four-term congressman who is one of Trump's most visible defenders in the House, fought a fierce battle for voters from the conservative base of the GOP. Warnock mostly floated above the fray.
 Though Collins immediately endorsed Loeffler as part of his concession, the bitterly personal tone of their attacks could make it difficult for supporters of the Republican rivals to unite in time for the January runoff, University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock said.
 For Loeffler, "her challenge would be to simply get Republicans back behind her," Bullock said. "That's a real risk."
 Both Perdue and Loeffler were among senators whose stock trades, made just before the virus caused a downturn in the markets, came under scrutiny. Both denied wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by independent advisers and were ultimately cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee.
 Regardless, their opponents made the trades a central line of attack. Collins accused Loeffler of "pandemic profiteering," while Ossoff accused Perdue of having "profited from the pandemic while he downplayed the risk."
 The top Democrats outraised the Republican incumbents, but the Republicans were also buoyed by outside spending. More than $160 million has been spent on television and digital advertising by candidates and outside groups in both races.
 In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, John Benson showed up nearly an hour before polls opened at the Cobb County Civic Center, waiting in near freezing temperatures. He said he wants senators who are not afraid to stand up to the president.
 "Since Donald Trump been in office, it's been like a lot of them have been scared to speak up," Benson said.

First has to be the question of why Trump’s insouciant attitude to the pandemic – so unlike that of almost other world leaders – did not cost him more in votes. That was just one of the things that the opinion polls got wrong. His defiance of the rules on masks and social distancing should – according to received opinion – have put him beyond the pale. In most European countries, that would probably have been true. But “libertarianism” is not a minority doctrine in the United States: it is the very essence of national identity. Every school child learns of Patrick Henry's great revolutionary cry, “Give me liberty or give me death.” When Trump refused to submit to the restrictions, he was seen – by a significant tranche of the electorate – not as irresponsible, but as living up to the true American credo. And then, like some fabled hero, he caught the virus and conquered it.

Election day is turning into election week in the US, as the more tightly contested race for the White House yields no clear result at the end of the night. If things continue, we may not necessarily get a clear result until tomorrow afternoon perhaps.
   
 But in any case, there might be more complications to follow if the courts are brought into this over the next few days.
   
 The market is feeling rather jittery now after the early optimism as everything now hangs in the balance. This was a risk that should not have materialised if you go by the pollsters and boy, have they got it all wrong this year (again).
   
 Anyway, as we are here now, we can only work with what we have in front of us.
   
 The way I see it, there's only two likely outcomes:
   
 1\. Biden wins, Republicans hold the Senate
 2\. Trump wins, Republicans hold the Senate
   
 I reckon risk assets would only prefer a Biden win if Democrats won the Senate race as well but that is a tall order in which I don't quite imagine is going to happen.
   
 The dollar may lose some ground on the result but amid more gridlock in Washington, I just don't see how the market can be optimistic about that.
   
 Given that scenario, the dollar may find some bids down the road on more fear/jitters.
   
 As for stocks, I would argue at the end of it all, investors may see short- term reprieve regardless of the result. It is sort of like just to catch some breath.
   
 But in the bigger picture, if no stimulus is coming, that won't bode well for risk.
   
 If Trump wins, I imagine that stocks and the dollar will both rally should Republicans hold the Senate. The greenback already has shown some poise in moving over the last few hours but I would argue that gains may be more limited this time around.
   
 My view is that we are not going to get a repeat of the 2016 melt up in the dollar and with stimulus to follow, the reflation trade narrative will quickly settle back in.
   
 As such, I see scope for some dollar weakness once the dust settles after some short-term gains which could follow on the back of a Trump win.

IRVING AND SALAMANCA – The current treasurer of the Seneca Nation of Indians will serve as the nation's president following Tuesday's election.
 A spokesman for the Seneca Nation announced late Tuesday that current Seneca Nation Treasurer Matt Pagels secured a victory in the race for nation president following a tally of votes on the Allegany and Cattaraugus territories. Pagels received a total 1,279 votes, to lead a Seneca Party sweep of all races on the ballot. Pagel’s challenger received 559 votes.
 “I am incredibly grateful for the support I have received and for the opportunity to lead the Seneca Nation as our next president,” said Pagels, who lives on the Cattaraugus Territory. “Throughout this past year, we have seen how our community can respond to unimaginable challenges. We’ve proven that we are stronger together.”

WILMINGTON, Delaware — Joe Biden told supporters just after midnight on Wednesday that he was confident he would ultimately win a presidential race that remained unsettled in several large battleground states.
 “We feel good about where we are,” the former vice president said at the Chase Center in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. “We really do. I’m here to tell you tonight we believe we’re on track to win this election. We knew because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote it was going to take a while. And we’re going to have to be patient until the hard work of tallying votes is finished. And it ain’t over till every vote is counted, every ballot is counted — but we’re feeling good. We’re feeling good about where we are.”
 Biden thanked supporters for their patience at the start of his remarks and suggested the winner of the race may not be clear for at least another day, but he projected optimism about some states that do not yet have a clear winner.
 “We’re confident about Arizona,” he said, calling the state a turnaround. “We’re still in the game in Georgia, although that’s not one we expected,” he added. “And we’re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way, it’s going to take time to count the votes, but we’re going to win Pennsylvania.”
 Crucial states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Georgia are still counting votes, including a surge of mail-in ballots. Trump has secured vital wins — including in Florida and Ohio — that make the race for an Electoral College majority tight and block some of Biden’s paths to victory.
 Trump also projected confidence on Twitter and said he planned to make a speech early Wednesday morning as well.
 Slow tallying was expected as a likely outcome of the election: The coronavirus pandemic brought a flood of mail-in and early in-person voting, especially from Democrats, and some states like Pennsylvania did not begin to count those votes until Election Day.
 “Keep the faith, guys. We’re going to win this,” Biden said at the end of his short speech. “Thank you, thank you, thank you.”
 The scene surrounding Biden’s election night gathering — held in a parking lot outside the riverfront convention hall where he accepted the Democratic nomination over the summer — hardly resembled a festive event. The campaign limited the number of people who could attend because of the coronavirus pandemic. Biden’s supporters stayed with their cars, as if at a drive-in movie, and watched from a distance. They honked their horns as they waited for Biden and heard MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow announce Minnesota was trending in the former vice president’s direction. There were plenty of empty spaces in the lot, though.
 The lobby of the hotel on site was mostly empty except for reporters and, occasionally, Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware ally of Biden’s who is often called upon to speak for his friend.
 “I've literally been out there freezing,” Coons told reporters after one lap through the parking lot about an hour before Biden arrived. “Remember, there's an entire parking lot full of Delaware Democrats. And so every time I go out, I do 10 minutes of ‘Hey, how are you?!’”
 Coons, during one of his lobby walks, was asked about the slow counting and Trump’s resilience in states that Biden's allies thought might be winnable.
 “That may be the hardest question for me to answer tonight,” Coons replied. “Because I think the ways in which President Trump has divided us, has taken advantage of our divisions and cracked wider open, has misled us during a pandemic. And has failed in his responsibility to keep America safe. I mean, to me, this isn't a close call.”
 Biden kept his speech to just a few minutes, with his motorcade idling outside the Chase Center, waiting to ferry him back home.
 “Kamala and I will talk to you tomorrow,” he said, mentioning his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, before ducking offstage.

From there, Collins went on to serve on boards for the Greater Cheyenne Chamber of Commerce and Prevent Child Abuse Wyoming, on top of his involvement with the Cheyenne Greenway, Cheyenne Soccer Association and Leadership Cheyenne, where he received the National Distinguished Leadership Award in 1999.
 Having grown up in Wyoming and attending Carey Junior High, East High School and University of Wyoming, Collins found a calling in civil service when he was elected to the Cheyenne City Council in 2000. During that time, he served three terms and was elected as council president four times.
 With that experience, Collins hopes to rebuild better relationships with the City Council and other local groups, address the city’s road and deferred maintenance problems, and make Cheyenne more business friendly.
 “The number of votes that we got shows that our message was right on target – what the residents want is what we’ve been talking about. So that puts pressure on us, because we told them we’re going to do it. Now, we’re actually going to go out and do what we said we were going to do,” Collins said.
 While Collins and Coppinger disagreed on a number of solutions for the city’s problems, Coppinger said they ran clean campaigns, adding that Collins raised and spent more money on the road to mayor.
 “The city voted for who they wanted to vote for. That’s what they wanted; they wanted the same thing they’ve always had,” Coppinger said.
 Going forward, Collins will begin his transition alongside Orr, who has said her administration will work to make the change as easy as possible. Collins will take office on Jan. 4.

A nationwide push to relax drug laws took a significant step forward Tuesday as five more states legalized marijuana for adults and voters made Oregon the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of street drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. The drug measures were among 120 proposed state laws and constitutional amendments that were on the ballot in 32 states. They touched on an array of issues that have roiled politics in recent years — voting rights, racial inequalities, abortion, taxes and education, to name a few. But none directly dealt with the dominant theme of 2020 — the coronavirus pandemic. That’s because the process to put measures on the ballot began, in most cases, before the virus surged to the forefront. The Oregon drug initiative will allow people arrested with small amounts of hard drugs to avoid going to trial, and possible jail time, by paying a $100 fine and attending an addiction recovery program. The treatment centers will be funded by revenues from legalized marijuana, which was approved in Oregon several years ago. “Today’s victory is a landmark declaration that the time has come to stop criminalizing people for drug use,” said Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which backed the measure. The proposal was endorsed by the Oregon Democratic Party, as well as some nurses and physician associations. The Oregon Republican Party had denounced the drug decriminalization measure as radical, and some prosecutors called it reckless. Oregon voters also approved a measure making the state the first to legalize the therapeutic use of psychedelic mushrooms. Voters in New Jersey and Arizona approved measures legalizing marijuana for adults age 21 and older. In New Jersey, the...

Election day is turning into election week in the US, as the more tightly contested race for the White House yields no clear result at the end of the night. If things continue, we may not necessarily get a clear result until tomorrow afternoon perhaps.But in any case, there might be more complications to follow if the courts are brought into this over the next few days.The market is feeling rather jittery now after the early optimism as everything now hangs in the balance. This was a risk that should not have materialised if you go by the pollsters and boy, have they got it all wrong this year (again).Anyway, as we are here now, we can only work with what we have in front of us.The way I see it, there's only two likely outcomes:1. Biden wins, Republicans hold the Senate2. Trump wins, Republicans hold the SenateI reckon risk assets would only prefer a Biden win if Democrats won the Senate race as well but that is a tall order in which I don't quite imagine is going to happen.The dollar may lose some ground on the result but amid more gridlock in Washington, I just don't see how the market can be optimistic about that.Given that scenario, the dollar may find some bids down the road on more fear/jitters.As for stocks, I would argue at the end of it all, investors may see short-term reprieve regardless of the result. It is sort of like just to catch some breath.But in the bigger picture, if no stimulus is coming, that won't bode well for risk.If Trump wins, I imagine that stocks and the dollar will both rally should Republicans hold the Senate. The greenback already has shown some poise in moving over the last few hours but I would argue that gains may be more limited this time around.My view is that we are not going to get a repeat of the 2016 melt up in the dollar and with stimulus to follow, the reflation trade narrative will quickly settle back in.As such, I see scope for some dollar weakness once the dust settles after some short-term gains which could follow on the back of a Trump win.What are your views on the market right now?

Voters of Massachusetts said no Tuesday night to a reform that would have dramatically altered the way voters choose their elected leaders, rejecting a ballot question backed by a who's who of current and former political leaders from both parties that would have allowed voters in future statewide elections to rank candidates in races with three or more choices on the ballot.
 Voters approved the other ballot question, breaking in favor of giving independent mechanics access to wireless vehicle data to repair cars by a 3-1 margin, according to incomplete and unofficial returns.
 Supporters of the auto repair question said their win at the ballot box would ensure that consumers can get their car or truck repaired wherever they want, but even after conceding defeat opponents of Question 1 said the Right to Repair Committee failed to show why the change was necessary.
 Unofficial results showed voters favoring Question 1 by a 3-1 margin with over 65% of precincts reporting, according to The Associated Press.
 "It's your car. You paid for it. You should be able to get it fixed where you want," said Tommy Hickey, campaign director for the Yes on 1 campaign.
 The verdict on ranked-choice voting, also known as Question 2, took longer, but proponents conceded their campaign not long after midnight after waiting to see if votes from some of the larger cities in Massachusetts could turn the early momentum against the initiative back in its favor.
 "We came up short in this election, and we are obviously deeply disappointed," said campaign manager Cara Brown McCormick. "But that's certainly no reflection of the hard work of the thousands of dedicated volunteers, staff and surrogates of this campaign. Even amidst a global pandemic, we were able to mobilize a movement to strengthen our democracy in a time when it's needed most. We were attempting to do something historic in Massachusetts and fell short, but the incredible groundswell of support from volunteers and reformers that assembled behind this campaign is reason enough to stay optimistic about the future of our democracy."
 With 80% of precincts reporting, the ranked choice voting question trailed with 45.5% supporting the initiative and 54.5% opposed, despite proponents raising nearly $10 million and vastly outspending opponents who raised just over $3,500.
 The goal of the ballot question was to require the winner of a political campaign to secure a majority of the votes cast and to cut down on the influence of "spoiler" candidates by allowing voters to rank their choices rather than vote for just one candidate. Supporters also said ranked-choice voting, which has been adopted by just one other state (Maine), would force candidates to try to appeal to a broader swath of the electorate and cut down on negative campaigning.
 But the opposition, which included Gov. Charlie Baker, worried that a ranked- choice system, also known as instant runoff, would inject a degree of complication to the voting process that would discourage more people from getting involved.
 "At a time when we need to be promoting turnout and making it easier for voters to cast their ballots, we worry that Question 2 will add an additional layer of complication for both voters and election officials, while potentially delaying results and increasing the cost of elections," Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said last week as hundreds of thousands of voters were already casting their ballots.
 The ranked-choice ballot question had the support of U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, who won re-election Tuesday, as well as past governors from both parties like Deval Patrick and William Weld, and former Secretary of State John Kerry.
 The system is designed to avoid situations like the one that unfolded in the 4th Congressional District this cycle. Congressman-elect Jake Auchincloss won a crowded Democratic primary in September with 22% of the vote.
 Under a ranked-choice system, the eventual winner of a campaign would have to earn a majority of the votes cast. If there is not winner after the first counting of the ballots, the lowest finisher would be eliminated and their votes redistributed based on their voters' second choice.
 The process would continue to until someone could claim a majority.
 The change would have been one of the most significant election reforms in generations. In 1966, the term of the governor was extended to four years and six years later in 1972 voters lowered the voting age to 18. But in those cases and other reform over the years, the manner by which voters elected their public officials remained unchanged.
 On the other ballot question of the night, voters approved an update to the 2013 "right to repair" law, which ensured that independent auto repair facilities had access to the same vehicle diagnostic data as manufacturers and dealerships.
 The new ballot law will require that the owner of a vehicle be allowed to give independent repair shops access to the mechanical data collected and transmitted wirelessly by computers onboard cars and trucks. The systems, known as telematics, were not covered by the 2013 law, but have become more prevalent in newer models.
 The history of the auto repair question is a unique one.
 In 2012, lawmakers struck a deal over access to diagnostic information, but it was too late to remove the "right to repair" question from the ballot, and voters wound up passing a version different from the compromise. The Legislature a year later revised the ballot law to better capture what had been negotiated between mechanic and car manufacturers.
 Leaders on Beacon Hill are not ruling out again tinkering with the newest motor-vehicle data ballot law.
 State Sen. Paul Feeney, D-Foxborough, who co-chairs the Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure, said he has not had any formal discussion about reviewing the ballot law, but would be open to hearing suggestions for how it could be improved.
 "I felt it was best to respect the process and let the voters decide before we started discussing hypotheticals," Feeney said Tuesday. "I am certainly inclined, however, to meet with all of the stakeholders and regulators if the ballot initiative passes, to ensure that it can be implemented effectively with both consumer protection and public safety in mind."
 "I feel strongly that the will of the voters is sacrosanct, however, and I am extremely reticent to support any major or substantive changes to the law, if passed at the ballot," he added.
 Hickey, in his post-election remarks, dismissed concerns raised by some opponents that it would be unworkable to require manufacturers to outfit vehicles starting with 2022 models with an open-access data platform compatible with an app for consumers that would have to be designed for repair information to be shared.
 "The automakers and their army of lobbyists will make noise and make up stories, saying, 'It can't be done,' just like they did during the campaign," Hickey said. "In fact, they said the same exact thing about implementing the first right to repair in 2012, but you rejected the automakers flimsy arguments with your votes and the will of the voters matters."
 While repair shop owners argued that this information was necessary to preserve the livelihoods of independent auto mechanics and give consumers choice in who repairs their vehicle, opponents said it could expose drivers to data theft and was not necessary to repair a vehicle.
 The Coalition for Safe and Secure Data tapped into the more than $26.4 million raised to fight the ballot question to run numerous ads, including ominous spots suggesting that location data could be stolen, putting victims of domestic violence at risk.
 "As we have said from the beginning, the right to repair and the ability of local repair shops to access vehicle repair information are already enshrined in Massachusetts law. Today's vote will do nothing to enhance that right -- it will only grant real time, two-way access to your vehicle and increase risk. At no point did the Yes side provide any credible arguments as to why national auto parts chains need this information to service your vehicles," the Coalition for Safe and Secure Data said in a statement.
 The ad war between the two side was paid for with huge sums of outside money that flowed into Massachusetts, with parts manufacturers like Auto Zone helping to fund a more than $24 million campaign to pass the ballot question, and car manufacturers like General Motors, Ford and Toyota financing the $26 million opposition campaign.
 Ranked-choice voting also enjoyed deep-pockets support from out of state, with major contributions coming from wealthy proponents of ranked-choice voting such as the Houston-based Action Now Initiative.
 The list of wealthy donors backing the question also included Kathryn Murdoch, president of Quadrivium and daughter-in-law of media mogul Rupert Murdoch; Eton Park Capital Management CEO Eric Mindich; and Jonathan Soros, CEO of JS Capital Management and son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros.

The administration also withdrew from international institutions such as the United Nations Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. By doing so, the United States has effectively lost its voice in these institutions. There is a debate to be had over the effectiveness of these international organizations, as is always the case, but certainly the United States is neither strengthened nor secured by actively disengaging from long- standing responsibilities. Instead, it has opened the door for opposing nations to fill the void.
 There is also the matter of the Trump administration’s inappropriate communication. As an example, Michael Pompeo, the Secretary of State, released a statement saying that “the conduct of elections is important not only for Africans, but also for defenders of democracy around the world. We believe all sides should participate peacefully in the democratic process. Repression and intimidation have no place in democracies.”
 The United Nations recognizes 54 African nations. Which nation was Pompeo referring to, all of them, or one in particular? Are we to gather, from his remarks, that the entirety of the African continent has an issue with democratic elections? These are only a couple of the questions that arise with such broad remarks.
 Such comments can worsen international disputes. Trump just recently responded to concerns about the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which has been a point of contention between Egypt and Ethiopia. Trump said that Egypt might “blow up” the dam, which led Ethiopian officials to question whether the president was allying with Egypt against Ethiopia. The prime minister of Ethiopia responded by saying that the nation “will not cave in to aggressions of any kind.”
 Leaders must be explicit in their statements and avoid careless assertions that might lead to conflict. Confusion and doubt are not constructive when communicating at the international level. The Trump administration seems unwilling to practice this mindfulness.
 While it is true that under the Trump administration there have been recent peace deals between Israel and some of the states on the Persian Gulf, most of these states have worked closely with the United States for several years and have been pursuing normalization with Israel without the direct involvement of the U.S. Furthermore, they largely ignore the question of the Palestinians, who have been left out of the entire process. One is left to wonder whether these peace deals outweigh the harm Trump has caused in other areas, and whether they are as groundbreaking as the administration has claimed them to be.
 Many of Trump’s domestic policies might be undone within a few years, but the position of the United States on the international stage could be damaged for decades to come. Whatever happens in the coming months and years, the United States will have to deal with either reversing these isolationist policies, or learn to exist outside of the international spotlight.

"I'll get text messages from him, when we lose a tough game or things aren't going great, just saying 'keep your chin up,'" UNCP athletic director Dick Christy said during Friday's program.

Winning the PGA Championship in August has been the highlight of Collin Morikawa's short career but the American said being a major winner does not automatically make things easier on the PGA Tour. The 23-year-old, who turned pro last year, triumphed at TPC Harding Park for his first major title but failed to make the cut at the US Open and Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in his first two starts on the 2020/21 Tour.

Democrats' hopes of breaking the state Republican supermajorities in both houses of the Kansas Legislature appear to be fading, with several races still too close to call.
   
 The minority party would need to flip one seat in the Kansas House, or three seats in the Kansas Senate.
   
 But it seems doubtful that the party will manage even that, with several incumbents in central or southern Kansas appearing to lose and not enough gains being made in surburban Kansas City, Kan., to offset those loses.
   
 Sen. Jeff Longbine, R-Emporia, acknowledged he was "surprised" by the GOP performance down ballot but that it was a testament to frustration with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as messaging from Republican candidates.
   
 "I think people are frustrated with the economy, they're frustrated with education, kids not being in school," Longbine said.
   
 The biggest battleground was in Johnson County, where some of the tightest Kansas House races were located.
   
 On the House side, which has the best chance of a supermajority being broken, Democrats picked up at least one seat with Jo-Ella Hoye winning in House District 17. Another flip had a much slimmer 500 vote margin, with Mari-Lynn Poskin leading Jane Dirks by only 450 votes in District 20. According to Poskin, a Democrat has never held that seat.
   
 But House Speaker Ron Ryckman appeared to survive his most competitive race yet, leading challenger Kathy Meyer by roughly 700 votes. And Republicans managed to hold onto District 49, fending off a challenge from Katie Dixon.
   
 Republicans also hit back with flips of their own as Pat Proctor beat Democrat Mike Griswold in House District 41 in Leavenworth County. Democrat incumbent Rep. Tim Hodge, D-North Newton, trails Republican Avery Anderson by 800 votes in his Harvey County district.
   
 Meanwhile in Hutchinson, Democratic incumbent Jason Probst has a three-vote lead over Republican challenger John Whitesel in the 102nd House District. Probst had previously been the westernmost Democrat in the caucus.
   
 On the Senate side, Democrat Cindy Holscher won the race for the seat held by retiring Senate Majority Leader Jim Denning, R-Overland Park, a flip widely expected for Democrats.
   
 Democrat Jeff Pittman defeated incumbent Sen. Kevin Braun in Senate District 5, marking another pickup for Democrats. The party also appeared to hold onto a Leavenworth County Senate seat held by Sen. Tom Holland.
   
 But Republicans held the lead in virtually all other competitive state Senate races. In Senate District 18, conservative Mike Thompson held a 1,800 vote lead over Democrat Lindsey Constance in a race heavily targeted by left- leaning groups.
   
 In Senate District 11 Republican Kellie Warren held a 2,600 vote lead over Democrat Joy Koesten.
   
 Elsewhere, Republicans appeared to hold onto the seat vacated by retiring Sen. Julia Lynn, although Democrat Stacey Knoll fell only 2,000 votes shy of toppling Beverley Gossage. And Republican Rob Olson held a larger 2,600 vote lead over Democrat Wendy Budetti.
   
 In a further blow to Democrats' hopes in the Senate, two Republican candidates, Sen. Mike Peterson and Renee Erickson, had significant leads over their Democratic opponents with all precincts reporting. Erickson is running to replace Senate President Susan Wagle, who is retiring.
   
 And in the most shocking result of the night, Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley trailed his Republican challenger by 800 votes, with one precinct yet to report. Hensley is the longest tenured legislator in the body's history and won reelection in 2016 by over 4,000 votes.
   
 A handful of races in both chambers remain too close to call.
   
 One of the biggest issues that will result from who wins the supermajority is redistricting. The next Legislature will get to decide congressional and state legislative maps for the next decade.
   
 Other issues, ranging from abortion to Medicaid expansion, will likely be shaped significantly if Democrats fail to break the supermajority.

"One of the many preparations for Hurricane Harvey included EPA, TCEQ, and other monitoring entities temporarily removing approximately 75 percent of the stationary air monitoring equipment from the greater Houston, Corpus Christi, and Beaumont areas. Since then, state and local authorities are working to get the systems up and running again.

The second major driver of the Track-and-Trace and Serialization Market is ensuring regulatory compliance. Pharmaceutical companies need to plan and implement their Track-and-Trace and Serialization initiatives at the earliest. The U.S. and the EU will require mandatory serialisation from November 2017 and these two are the largest pharmaceutical markets by far. Together, they account for more than half the industry volume. Thus, companies already in, or wishing to enter these highly lucrative regions will need to comply with their serialisation requirements since their immense size makes them too important to ignore. While other countries like China and Turkey have already adopted these laws, the rest of the developing world will slowly but surely follow suit.

America is not guaranteed.
 There is, in other words, nothing foreordained about this country someday returning to anything approximating normal. That’s important to keep in mind as we await results of the most critical U.S. election since 1860, when Abraham Lincoln came to power in an America pulling apart. Not unlike the America we live in now.
 When you read history in books, events can seem as if they were destined all along. It becomes easy to think, albeit subconsciously, that the happy ending was inevitable — if only because the unhappy one is unthinkable. So, of course the Union routed the Confederacy. Of course the Great Depression eased. Of course we won World War II. Of course.

The only other contested statewide election on the ballot was the race for Public Service Commission President. Republican incumbent Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh had 33,402 votes, or 70.5%, while Democratic challenger Laura Casey had 13,884 votes, or 29.3%.
 Limestone County voters also overwhelmingly approved an amendment to the Alabama Constitution, which provides that a person is not liable for using deadly physical force in self-defense or in the defense of another person on the premises of a church under certain conditions. That amendment was only on the ballot in Limestone County.
 Voters approved the amendment 83.5% to 16.5%. There were 36,209 "yes" votes and only 7,169 "no" votes.

The additional $12 per month increase is based on the average home price in Montgomery County, which is roughly $127,000.Renters might not see any increases to their rents or leases, however, it is possible that any tax increase could be passed on to the renters or leasers.The referendum garnered support from leaders in city government, the school system, even local places of worship.Multiple leaders sent statements following the Election Day results.“We are overjoyed that Montgomery voters believe in what we are doing and want to see more of our children succeed. A lot has changed for MPS over the last few years. Our commitment to giving our 28,000 students and 4,000 employees the resources and academic opportunities to thrive remains a top priority. We look forward to moving forward together," said Montgomery Public Schools Superintendent Ann Roy Moore.“Today is a great day for our schools and for Montgomery. Over the course of this campaign, our system has strengthened relationships with numerous businesses, houses or worship, community organizations, and others that will only help MPS move forward. Our schools are strongest when we all work together, and I look forward to building on these relationships to help our students succeed in the days and years to come,” said Clare Weil, president of the Montgomery County Board of Education.“Today, Montgomery voted to invest in our future and our work doesn’t end here. Access to high quality education is essential to our economic future and we are anxious to continue the collaborative partnerships that have formed across the community to create the most prosperous future for Montgomery,” said Arthur Ducote, chairman of the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce.“I am very happy! This is a wonderful thing for our students, teachers, and the entire county as a whole. This vote for MPS shows our young people that the Montgomery community believes in them, supports them, and is eager to see them thrive. We are without a doubt committed to Montgomery Public Schools,” said Montgomery County Commission Chairman Elton Dean. “The Montgomery County Commission decided we were going to put forth the effort to get the much needed mils for our schools and we brought the team together to make that happen. I applaud all the Commissioners for putting aside their political party and raising their hand to place this on the ballot. The Commission’s unanimous vote showed this was a nonpartisan effort and had support from all walks of life. It was a great effort by all elected officials along with the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce and the business community. We are going to celebrate and then we are going to get to work to continue to move our schools forward.”Not everyone sees the proposed tax increase as a good idea, though. The Auburn-based democracy reform organization Take Back Our Republic campaigned against the proposal, claiming it was rushed through.MPS officials and parents say this is not true, and the referendum had passed the school board.Copyright 2020 WSFA 12 News.

On Wednesday I was tossed from a "lounge," which is actually a message board that is privately run and frequented by fans of Tar Heel sports. This board offers a political forum for those who don't want to talk about, let's say, UNC's 48-21 win over N.C. State. It has devolved into a virtual watering hole for UNC graduates who are what I would call the Looney Left. They are rare in these here parts.
