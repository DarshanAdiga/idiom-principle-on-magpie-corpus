1984'te "Madonna" albümünü takip eden ikinci albüm çalışması "Like A Virgin", uluslararası bir başarının kapılarını açtı. Albümle aynı adı taşıyan ilk single "Like A Virgin", Billboard Hot 100 Singles listesinde 6 hafta süreyle bir numarada kaldı. O tarihte, ülkenin başarılı şarkıcılarının Afrika'daki açlara yardım amacıyla bir araya gelerek seslendirdikleri "We Are The World" , Billboard listelerinin bir numarasıydı ve ikinci sırada Madonna'nın bir diğer 45'liği "Material Girl" yer alıyordu. USA For Africa's'ta We Are The World'ü de söyleyen Madonna için bu çifte başarı anlamına geliyordu. Albümün çıkış tarihinin hemen ardından gelen 20 milyonluk satışı, sonraları tüm dünyada 17 milyon kopyanın daha satmasıyla 37 milyon olacaktı.

I worked up a sweat walking to this spot. My facemask funneled my breath onto my glasses and blinded me. I removed my glasses, reasoning that any bird that topped the hill would be close enough to see its beard unaided and determine its legality as an adult gobbler. Minutes later, three red and white heads poked over the ridge at a range of about 30 yards, but their chests were not visible. The birds did not like that gobbler decoy. They stared at it for about five seconds before one bird peeled away and dropped out of sight. The others quickly followed, leaving me sorely disappointed.

Thomas Lee Crawshaw   March 26, 1941 - April 19, 2020   Pleasant Hill, CA   Pleasant Hill resident, Tom Crawshaw passed away at home, with his wife by his side, on Sunday, April 19, 2020 at the age of 79.   He was born in Detroit, MI to Monroe and Mary Jane (Clark) Crawshaw. After his father's passing, Tom and his family moved to the Los Angeles area where he attended Compton High School before serving in the United States Navy. He enjoyed a long career as a draftsman. Most notably, he was employed at Raytheon Technologies in San Jose, CA and at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA.   Tom was married to Anne Rohl for five years, and they had two children before their separation. He married Betty Whipple in 1974, and they had two more children together.   Tom was a man of few words. He had a strong faith and cared deeply for those around him. He was active in the churches he attended over the years and was always one to lend a hand. He was a good neighbor and was happy to share his bountiful garden.   His children remember him as…   A man who made sacrifices. At a time when the children typically went with their mother after a divorce, Tom stepped up and took on the role of a single father. He raised two young children on his own without complaint.   A man who truly enjoyed sailing. When his older two children were young, they remember heading to Ensenada, camping on the sand bar and sailing around the bay. He even built his own catamaran.   A man who loved gardening. He took pride in growing many things, food, flowers and bonsai. They have fond memories of gardening together, even after he lost depth perception due to dwindling eyesight.   He was preceded in death by his parents, Monroe and Mary Jane, and by his stepfather, George Nelson. He is survived by Betty, his wife of 47 years, by his children Bob, Kelly, Jennifer and Joanna, and by his siblings Bruce, David and Crystal. He is also survived by 7 grandchildren, 1 great grandson and several nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly.   Cremation services have been arranged and a memorial will be scheduled at a later date.         View the online memorial for Thomas Lee Crawshaw

During all of this, Frank had been operating as effectively a one-man show, and so the Round Rock location - which had only opened on Feb. 28 - had gone dark. However, with Austin closed, it was time to fire up that second site. He checked with the city, which turned out to be an easier proposition than in Austin since the Round Rock location is in the city-run Old Settlers Park, making them his landlord. He got the green light to reopen on April 8 - with one strict rule. "We are allowed to stay open as long as nobody gets out of their car for any reason." That rule meant closing the bathrooms and the walk- up concession stand, both of which gave Frank cause to pause. Finally, he decided that reopening "seemed really important, if I can give people a sense of normalcy in these times."

Moberly's Aquatic Center will be closed this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic and financial matters associated with the coronavirus.
   
 In a press release Thursday, the Moberly Parks and Recreation Department (MPRD) announced that the city's municipal swimming pool will be closed for the 2020 summer season. The decision arrived at the heels of a special park board meeting held at noon April 30 who followed same measures executed by other communities across the state.
   
 "This was a difficult decision as we all want things to return to normal, but many considerations about the unique requirements of aquatics setting in this climate made it abundantly clear that the best and quickest way to return to normal was to forego operating the Aquatic Center in 2020," the press release read.
   
 MPRD Director Troy Bock said city personnel and board members are concerned that if a second wave of the virus materialized, it would be in the public's best interest for the swimming pool not to be a contributing factor in spreading the virus.
   
 Health and safety welfare for both pool goers and employees alike, as well as the financial impact weighed-in on the closure decision.
   
 "If opened, there would have been significant restrictions in hours including closures throughout the day to sanitize … severe restrictions on the number allowed to attend, and more," the press release read. "These measures would have meant guests would have been inconvenienced and services would have been limited to the point where there was no merit in opening."
   
 Additional staff would have to be hired not only to assist with the additional measures of sanitizing, but also to administer temperature readings of every person walking through the gate and monitoring guests' well-being. MPRD would also be responsible for purchasing personal protective equipment for employees and additional cleaning supplies.
   
 Bock said the city's municipal swimming pool employs more than 25 persons, and it has had a long history of operating in the red financially, arriving at a deficit of more than $30,000 annually.
   
 During this uncertain time of weathering through a pandemic that temporarily closed non-essential businesses,the past two months consumers have turned to online sales and deliveries for goods. With this trait, the loss of sales tax revenue places a financial hit upon budgets of local governments to render public services.
   
 "This would come amidst the expectations of our department revenues dropping overall from thousands of dollars of lost rentals already to significant potential reductions in sales and use tax, which makes up approximately 70% of the department's revenue," said Bock. "Not having the Aquatic Center open will help mitigate the sudden impact of loss revenues coming in. We will not know the financial impact of the sales tax revenue for another two to three months."
   
 "We have to work together as a community to keep our citizens safe and help prevent the spread of COVID-19," Bock stated. "We are all saddened to have to make this decision, but together we can all do our part, to save one life, to help the hospitals from being overwhelmed, ensure PPE is used strategically, protect employees and the public, and make people feel safe to go out."

However, an increasing occurrence of flu due to an interconnected, interdependent world is bound to ensure that the flu protection kit market thrives in the long term.

Thomas Lee Crawshaw March 26, 1941 - April 19, 2020 Pleasant Hill, CA Pleasant Hill resident, Tom Crawshaw passed away at home, with his wife by his side, on Sunday, April 19, 2020 at the age of 79. He was born in Detroit, MI to Monroe and Mary Jane (Clark) Crawshaw. After his father's passing, Tom and his family moved to the Los Angeles area where he attended Compton High School before serving in the United States Navy. He enjoyed a long career as a draftsman. Most notably, he was employed at Raytheon Technologies in San Jose, CA and at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA. Tom was married to Anne Rohl for five years, and they had two children before their separation. He married Betty Whipple in 1974, and they had two more children together. Tom was a man of few words. He had a strong faith and cared deeply for those around him. He was active in the churches he attended over the years and was always one to lend a hand. He was a good neighbor and was happy to share his bountiful garden. His children remember him as… A man who made sacrifices. At a time when the children typically went with their mother after a divorce, Tom stepped up and took on the role of a single father. He raised two young children on his own without complaint. A man who truly enjoyed sailing. When his older two children were young, they remember heading to Ensenada, camping on the sand bar and sailing around the bay. He even built his own catamaran. A man who loved gardening. He took pride in growing many things, food, flowers and bonsai. They have fond memories of gardening together, even after he lost depth perception due to dwindling eyesight. He was preceded in death by his parents, Monroe and Mary Jane, and by his stepfather, George Nelson. He is survived by Betty, his wife of 47 years, by his children Bob, Kelly, Jennifer and Joanna, and by his siblings Bruce, David and Crystal. He is also survived by 7 grandchildren, 1 great grandson and several nieces and nephews whom he loved dearly. Cremation services have been arranged and a memorial will be scheduled at a later date.

"What is special about the Big Squeeze that can't always be expressed in a concert is the community that has grown around the love of the accordion. Though we can't celebrate in person, people are rooting for their favorite contestant and cheering on the others equally. It's the behind the scenes impromptu jams, friendships, and moments shared that keep these traditions alive and well." - _Raoul Hernandez_
