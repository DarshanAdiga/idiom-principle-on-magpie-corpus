The Calgary Flames' best-of-five series against the Winnipeg Jets to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs is a go — and will kick off on Aug. 1 with Game 1 at the Edmonton hub location.
 The National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players' Association finally made it official.
 There will be hockey this summer.
 After a nearly four-month pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the two sides came to an agreement Friday evening and ratified a four-year extension to the Collective Bargaining Agreement through the 2025-26 season, along with making the NHL's 'Return to Play' plan official.
 For the Calgary Flames, it means their best-of-five series against the Winnipeg Jets to qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs is a go -- and will kick off on Aug. 1 with Game 1 at the Edmonton hub location.
 "It certainly feels like it's moving forward," said Flames general manager Brad Treliving, whose club will play Games 2 and 3 on Aug. 3 and 4, respectively. "We've been planning for it all along. This was a big hurdle in a long process, so it's good to have that ratified by both sides and we'll keep moving forward."
 In a release sent out by the NHL, the agreement indicated the conference finals and Stanley Cup final will be staged at Edmonton's Rogers Place. Meanwhile, each team will be permitted to bring a maximum of 52 individuals into the secure zones -- or 'bubble' -- in the hub cities, including a maximum of 31 players.
 When Phase 4 kicks off, each of the 52 members of club personnel will be tested daily for COVID-19, as well as being administered daily temperature checks and symptom screenings.
 Reports suggested that nearly 79 per cent of NHLPA membership voted in favour of the new CBA and 'Return to Play' program.
 Given the uncertain business climate presented by the global pandemic along with the cloudiness of the future, Treliving is pleased with the news.
 "To get a CBA done in this environment that we've all been living in, uncertain times and all the stuff that's been going on," he said. "You really think about it, since there's been a pause in play, we've gotten a CBA extension and 'Return to Play' plan put together in a time when there's so much uncertainty. A lot of days (through the COVID-19 pandemic), you were wondering 'What is going on (in the world)?'
 "I think (NHL commissioner) Gary Bettman, (deputy commissioner) Bill Daly and all the people at the league and the PA should be commended on the work that's been done and to get us to this point."
 A critical dates calendar was also released, which included details of the 2020 NHL Draft that was postponed from this past June to Oct. 9 and 10.
 The Stanley Cup will be awarded at the beginning of October while the 2020-21 season will begin in December.
 "There's going to be a lot going on in a short period of time," Treliving said. "It's taking small bites here, our focus is getting ready for Monday (the start of training camp) and going through camp and getting ready. But from basically the beginning of October through Dec. 1, there's going to be a lot going on. You just familiarize yourself with what is going to happen, be prepared and execute."
 Up next is the start of Monday's training camp at Scotiabank Saddledome and Phase 3 of the NHL's 'Return to Play' plan.
 "It's all the same things that have to happen (like normal seasons), but they're at a different time of the year and they're in really rapid succession," Treliving said. "It's good to know exactly what those dates are now so you can prepare.
 "But we're ready."

Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday arrested two more people from Madhya Pradesh's Gwalior in connection with the killings of eight policemen in Kanpur by gangster Vikas Dubey and his men on July 3, said officials.Vikas Dubey was shot dead on Friday morning after what the police have said was an escape attempt after a road accident near Kanpur city.They said the two Gwalior residents were arrested for harbouring two members of Vikas Dubey's gang for more than four days before they moved to another hideout.JN Singh, additional director general (ADG) of police of Kanpur Zone, said the two men have been identified as Om Prakash Pandey and Anil Pandey.Singh said they allowed Shashi Kant Pandey alias Sonu and Shivam Dubey, accused in Kanpur cops' killing case, to stay at their homes despite being well aware that the UP police are in their search.He said the two carry a reward of Rs 50,000 each for their head and are among the list of 21 active members of Vikas Dubey's gang released earlier.The senior official said the two Gwalior residents have been booked under section 216 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for harbouring the accused in the case.Vikas Dubey and five of his gang members, including Atul Dubey, Amar Dubey, Prem Prakash Pandey, Praveen Pandey and Prabhat Mishra, have been killed between July 3 and 10 and three have been arrested while 12 others are still at large. Of those still on the run, Gopal Saini and Heeru Dubey carry a reward of Rs 1 lakh each, and the remaining 10 carry a reward of Rs 50,000 each.Besides, seven people, including former Chaubeypur station officer Vinay Tewari and sub-inspector KK Sharma, have been arrested for criminal conspiracy and harbouring Vikas Dubey's gang members as well as helping them escape after the ambush.Vikas Dubey and his men had opened indiscriminate firing on the police team when they raided his house in Kanpur's Bikru village. Devendra Mishra, the circle officer of Bilhaur, three sub-inspectors and four constables were killed while six others were injured.

Businesses in Oneida County received millions of dollars in Paycheck Protection Program loans, according to information released by the Small Business Administration.
   
 The low-interest loans through the PPP are intended to help small businesses pay employee salaries amid the coronavirus pandemic. If certain employee retention and payroll expenditure metrics are met, the loans may be forgiven.
   
 New York's 22nd Congressional District received more than 7,733 loans to retain 98,794 jobs, according to a statement from SBA. A total of $239 million in loans were approved for the district, with an average loan size of $35,319.26.
   
 "Upstate New York small businesses fared very well in the PPP, and the numbers bear that out," said Steve Bulger, SBA regional administrator, in a statement.
   
 U.S. Rep. Anthony Brindisi, D-Utica, also weighed in Thursday, stating communities in Upstate New York did their part to flatten the COVID-19 curve in the state. He added that small businesses made sacrifices during the pandemic.
   
 "The bipartisan PPP program helped keep many small businesses afloat and helped thousands of workers keep their jobs," Brindisi said in the statement. "We are far from being out of the woods of the COVID-19 pandemic, but these numbers show that we are doing everything we can to get the resources to where they need to go."
   
 Major local recipients
   
 In Oneida County, the three businesses receiving the largest PPP loans were Assured Information Security Inc. of Rome, Slocum-Dickson Medical Network of New Hartford and Indium Corporation of America in Clinton.
   
 The SBA information did not disclose the specific amount companies received in low-interest loans, but arranged them in tiers. The top tier was $5 million to $10 million, which Indium Corporation, Slocum-Dickson and AIS fell under.
   
 AIS retained 100 jobs using PPP funds, while Slocum-Dickson retained 488 and Indium Corporation retained 500, according to the SBA.
   
 "We at AIS have the honor of supporting the mission of our great nation and the men and women in uniform, and unfortunately, these essential missions don't stop for pandemics," said Charles Green, president and CEO of AIS. "During a time of such uncertainty, we are grateful for the Payroll Protection Program, which has allowed us to continue to support the United States Department of Defense and bring our creativity and unique skills to our customers' missions."
   
 Indium Corporation was thankful to receive its PPP loan, president and COO Ross Berntson said in a statement.
   
 "It is being used to help keep our employment high as we serve our customers, many of whom manufacture critical and essential life-support equipment such as ventilators, other medical devices, first responder electronics and more," Bernston said.
   
 Slocum-Dickson declined to comment following a request from the Observer- Dispatch.
   
 Other area recipients
   
 A wide variety of businesses in Oneida County received more than $150,000 in PPP loans. The SBA did not release the name or addresses of businesses that received less than $150,000 in PPP loans.
   
 The House of the Good Shepherd in Utica, a provider for services including foster care and counseling, received a loan of between $2 million to $5 million. Revere Copper Products of Rome was in the same loan tier, as well as seven other businesses.
   
 The Kelberman Center, Legal Aid Society of Mid-New York and F.X. Matt Brewing Co. received loans between $1 million and $2 million. Included in the dozens of recipients in the same tier were Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute, Metal Solutions Inc. and The Neighborhood Center.
   
 Other local businesses, including Jay-K Lumber and Chanatry's Hometown Market, received loans ranging from $350,000 to $1 million. Manufacturers such as Sherrill Manufacturing, eateries such as Symeon's Greek Restaurant and not- for-profits such as YWCA of the Mohawk Valley also received similar awards.
   
 For local recipients such as Indium Corporation, the PPP loan funds were critical during the pandemic.
   
 "It is a privilege to supply and support the companies that are on the frontline, saving lives and protecting us all during these times," said Greg Evans, Indium Corporation CEO. "This loan is helping us serve these critical manufacturers."

Seavers retired from her job in 1985 after 35 years of faithful service to the Cairo Public Library system. “I don’t think my mother missed a day — maybe one when she had tonsillitis,” said her daughter, Karla Patton.
 Seavers and her husband, Norman Seavers Sr., had three children: twin girls Karla and Karen, and one boy, Norman Jr. The couple had been married for 65 years when her husband passed away in 2007. Her beloved daughter Karen Adkinson passed away in 2001.
 One does not become a centenarian without suffering some of life’s greatest losses. But it also is a rare achievement, especially considering that Seavers still lives at home and faithfully attends First Missionary Baptist Church.

First, if the PPP recipient spent the money quickly — within eight weeks for early applicants or 24 weeks for those who received an extension after the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was adopted in June — and appropriately, they’re in the clear. The loans, so long as 60% is spent on payroll, eventually convert into grants that are completely forgivable.

There is something familiar about Manchester United in 2020. They remind me of many of the Liverpool teams I played in. After an erratic start to the season, United head into the final games with renewed hope. They are unbeaten in 17 games and Bruno Fernandes has transformed mood and expectations. A top-four finish looks likely. There is a feeling the worst is behind them.I have always maintained that at clubs such as United the bigger picture is never as bad it appears during troubled periods. You hear and read about managers or clubs being 'five years behind' the leaders. I do not buy that.When you have United's financial clout, one or two outstanding signings can turn an inconsistent team into a Champions League qualifier, or a top-four side into a title challenger.United hope Fernandes is the man inspiring them to that first significant target of a Champions League place.They look stronger with him because top-class players bring out more from those around them. I often experienced similar reawakenings at Liverpool, especially when Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez joined the club.Within a few training sessions and games you realised you had a matchwinner so the belief soared and all the talk about managers 'needing a clear-out' subsided.That is why I would offer a note of caution to United fans. Just as the club is never as far away from a revival as it might seem after nightmare defeats, they are not always as near to being title contenders as it appears after a promising run.During my Anfield career, the regular source of mocking from rivals was the chant &quot;it is always your year&quot;. We often headed into pre-season talking cautiously but confidently about going closer to Manchester United, Arsenal or Chelsea, who for a long period were the only teams truly capable of lifting the title.Privately, I never went into any season believing we would win the league, but there were plenty in which I felt we could compete.That was often because we ended the previous league season so strongly, showing the encouraging signs so identifiable in United recently.In 2000-'01, Gerard Houllier's side suffered only two defeats in the last 16 games. A year later, we won 13 of our final 15 games.Under Rafa Benitez, we won 12 of our last 14 fixtures in 2005-'06, lost just two in 22 at the end of 2007-'08, and won 10 of the final 11 games in 2008-'09.&quot;We just need a couple more signings and we will be there,&quot; was the feeling, and we always had a strong representation of academy talent. Seeing Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood burst onto the scene reminds me of Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler's galvanising impact.Our problem was the same facing United now - the final step is toughest, especially when trying to establish a title-winning mentality.I would often compare Liverpool's squad to United's and think, player for player, they were not much better. I saw a few world-class players who could improve any team in the world, and others who would not have got into our side.The massive difference was Alex Ferguson, who made everyone wearing the Manchester United shirt believe they were worthy of it. He created that title- winning culture, not just in his best players, but everyone.Recreating that will take much more than an encouraging sequence of results.To eradicate inconsistent spells over 38 games and compete for the title in the next year or two will require another massive leap. Is this Manchester United side truly capable of going beyond 90 points next season? Not without more signings.The difference between United and other clubs is they have the cash to find answers. They were the Premier League's biggest spenders last summer and paid another £47 million for Fernandes in January.If they are proactive again, Liverpool do not spend and City get their signings wrong, United could close the gap. Getting past them is another matter.Let's not lose sight of the fact United are still fifth in a battle to finish fourth. That is not good enough given how much they have already invested.Out of context, anyone outside of the Premier League looking in will be asking how far has the club fallen where the United supporters are feeling more enthusiastic than in previous seasons.There is greater understanding of the club's transitional period under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer so he is being judged to a lower standard than predecessors. He has done a very good job since the turn of the year.I have stated before that I do not believe Solskjaer is the same level of coach as Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, even though he has enjoyed some excellent results against them. I am not convinced Solskjaer will ever have their aura. So there must be realism with hope. Management demands constant problem- solving. No sooner is one area of the team functioning, another issue arises.Fernandes' impact on United's front three is cause for excitement. Between them, Anthony Martial, Rashford and Greenwood have scored 56 this season, three more than Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane.That is not insignificant. On their day, the United trio can be devastating. But as a whole those statistics are no more relevant to the title race than Fowler and Stan Collymore (55) outscoring Andy Cole and Eric Cantona (32) in 1995-'96\. Who won the double that season?What matters in the Premier League is Liverpool have scored 16 more, conceded seven fewer, and collected 34 more points. Liverpool possess an attacking trio that is difficult to improve. Can we say the same of United?I think they need another world-class player at the top end of the pitch. Martial's goal record has improved but I am yet to be convinced he is the man to fire them to a title challenge.The players who elevated Liverpool from being a side chasing the top four into champions are Virgil van Dijk and Alisson. They take Klopp's side to a level beyond United, certainly defensively.United have to worry about their 'keeper. David De Gea's poor form has gone on too long for it to be described as a blip. I do not believe he will get back to the level he was three or four years ago. Given he is a high earner he will not be easy to move on. While there are those suggesting on- loan Dean Henderson is ready to step up, he is not ready.With respect to Sheffield United, there is a different pressure at Old Trafford. Some of the goals Henderson has conceded would have been scrutinised more if he was at Manchester United. However the observation is received, comparing the United of now to Liverpool in the 2000s is a compliment, not an insult.We were in a constant state of being close, but not close enough. United have the resources to bridge the gap to ensure their wait to return to the top is not so long.© Daily Telegraph, London

Manchester United and Wolves could meet in an all-English Europa League semi-final. With continental football resuming in August after the coronavirus suspension, the draw for next month's eight-team mini- tournament in Germany was made yesterday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are all but through, having won 5-0 at LASK in the first leg of their last-16 tie, and United would face Copenhagen or Istanbul Basaksehir on August 10 in Cologne in the single-leg quarter-finals. Wolves would play Roma or Sevilla in the quarter-finals, the match taking place on August 11 in Duisburg, if they overcome Olympiacos, whom they drew 1-1 with in the first leg in Greece. Should both progress to the semi-finals, the pair would do battle in a mouth- watering clash on August 16 in Cologne to decide who makes the August 21 final. Wolves' path to that point looks harder than that of United, while Rangers are on the other half of the draw. Steven Gerrard's men will face Inter Milan or Getafe in the quarter-finals if they manage an almighty last-16 comeback against Bayer Leverkusen, who secured a 3-1 win at Ibrox in March. UEFA has given the green light for the round-of-16 second legs to be played on August 5 and 6 at home teams' stadiums.

Then as now, those American troops were a conduit for American culture and content: Westerns hit movie theatres, and performance clubs for officers opened in spades around the country. Radio was also an important development. Though broadcasts for military members had popped up around the Pacific during the war, in 1945, an official Far East Network (FEN) was born, eventually comprising 18 stations in Japan, including WVTQ Osaka, known as the "Sagebrush Symphony" for its lineup of western swing.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer sat down with WAVE 3 News to discuss what happened after protesters shut down a ribbon cutting the mayor was participating in for a new apartment building in west Louisville.Protesters gathered behind Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer as he was addressing the crowd, prompting the mayor to sit down and listen to them.Protesters gathered behind Fischer as he was addressing the crowd, prompting the mayor to sit down and listen to them.The group held signs and revealed a banner that read 'Fire! Fire! Gentrifier!' The phrase was chanted as well.Fischer, then, approached the group.After speaking to protesters, one yelled out “We don’t want to have one-on-ones” - a response to a Fischer offer to meet with members.The same person then said, “You need to talk to the community.”Fischer next made his way to his vehicle. The protesters surrounded it but eventually allowed him to leave after LMPD showed up.The car of another woman at the event was blocked for a period of time as well. Previous to that protesters had confronted her.The mayor was attending the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Montgomery Apartments, a new, affordable-housing community in the Portland neighborhood.Several people spoke before Fischer including developers, who before protesters arrived, said they hoped to spur inclusiveness in the city and urged others to do the same."The advantaged need to support the ones in need," Gregg Rochman, a leader of the group Urban Acupuncture, said. "The oppressed deserve reparations, and the victims deserve justice."Protesters gathered at the affordable housing complex after the mayor had left said they believed what was being done was gentrification.What was supposed to be a ribbon-cutting event celebrating a new, affordable-housing apartment complex turned into a protest Friday morning."If you want to give your money to black people to build up their community, that's what we'll do," one protester said to developers.Another told them she didn’t want to rely on legislation, corporations, or the mayor to invest in the community.“If you care about black lives, pull your checkbook out,” she said. “Send some money to our PayPals, Cash app us, Venmo us right now.”Protesters also demanded police accountability, and that charges be brought against the police officers that killed Breonna Taylor. Some had signs asking Fischer to be fired or resign.A WAVE 3 News photographer at the scene said things became tense very quickly.When speaking about what happened on Friday evening with Shannon Cogan and John Boel on WAVE 3 News at 6 p.m., Fischer first acknowledged that the city needs more projects like the Montgomery Apartments project.“Everybody in every part of town deserves a nice place to live,” Fischer said. “That’s what the people of west Louisville tell us constantly. That’s what Vision Russell is about, Russell Place apartments is about, involving the neighbors in that as well.”The Vision Russell Plan is a city project with the intent of revitalizing Louisville’s Russell neighborhood. It has come under fire recently as Breonna Taylor’s family and their lawyers claim the City of Louisville and LMPD targeted people like Taylor’s ex-boyfriend to move them out of the area in order to bring in the development project.Eight members of the Louisville Metro Council sent Fischer’s office and letter on Thursday demanding the release of all documents regarding the Breonna Taylor case and its potential ties to The Vision Russell Plan. Those council members allege Fischer is not being transparent about the ongoings of the project.Fischer said he plans to give the council the documents they’re looking for.“We are open by default,” he said. “We have been honored nationally for our transparency efforts. So, whether it’s this project or any other project, we’re happy to do that. Most of our metro council has been involved with our Russell neighborhood deliberations as well. So, unless there’s something locked up by the FBI or attorney general, all the information we have is absolutely available to anybody.”Fischer, when then asked how protesters should be handled if becoming unruly and violent, insisted there has never been a stand-down order under his administration for police.Last month, LMPD officers reached out to WAVE 3 News with concerns they are being told by the mayor’s office to retreat during violent protesting.“I don’t even know what stand down means,” he said. “We always say if you can de-escalate because that is a better solution, as opposed to escalating the situation, you have to start with that. But people’s lives come first.”Fischer said the behavior of some rioters who have chosen to vandalize and tear apart the city during the recent civil unrest is not conducive as the community waits for the ruling of Attorney General Daniel Cameron and the FBI in the Breonna Taylor case. Protesters are pushing for the firing of the three LMPD officers involved in her death.“They are an important group, an important part of this city, exercising their First Amendment when they do it peacefully,” Fischer said of demonstrators in Louisville. “That’s the way it needs to be done.”The mayor ended his thoughts by acknowledging that police and criminal justice reform is long overdue in Louisville.“Let’s come together around these important issues, around racial justice, around systemic racism, around opportunities, around jobs for everybody,” he urged, “so that we can move forward as a city and make sure we’re doing the type of police reform and criminal justice reform that is long overdue in our city and our country as well.”Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.
