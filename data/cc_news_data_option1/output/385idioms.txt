Sue: Thank you so much for the interview! Years ago, my husband and I bought a warehouse with a view to using it for a business venture, which sadly didn't flourish, leaving us with a sad empty space and no one who wanted to buy a building. Myself and a colleague had been using a small part of the building to hold drama classes and we gradually annexed more and more space. We had a little stage for our drama class work and Grace Newton (Old Town Band) asked if she could use it to put on a show and so the Drama Factory was born. I rigged out the space, but as an actor I didn't really have a clue what I was doing - I learned fast!!!

With countries like the United States and Japan preparing to evacuate some citizens from the epicenter of the outbreak, residents from some countries in Africa fear their own governments won't follow suit.      "I'm feeling like I'm trapped here," said one Ethiopian student at Wuhan University of Science and Technology, who gave only his first name, Abel. He, like other students, cited worries that angering Chinese or their country's authorities could lead to retaliation, like loss of scholarships.
 In 2018, African students in China numbered more than 80,000. More than 4,000 are estimated to be in Wuhan alone.      The concerns are real. Even Africa's most developed economy, South Africa, has signaled it will not evacuate citizens. On Sunday it told students in China to adhere to university instructions, warning that leaving without permission "can have far-reaching consequences."      Some governments in Africa are helping their citizens leave. Morocco's king has ordered his government to repatriate 100 nationals from Wuhan, and Algeria's president ordered the "immediate" repatriation of 36 citizens in Wuhan, most of them students, the official APS news agency said.

The tale begins in the 1500s, when longleaf pine covered a vast area from North Carolina down to the tip of Texas and the Florida Panhandle -- "the largest forested lands in North America," the authors say. Over the next few hundred years, their pine tree grows to 120 feet. Naturally fire-resistant, it survives storms, woodpeckers, hunters and the Civil War, until it succumbs to loggers in the 1880s. The tree is then brought to a mill, shipped to New York, and taken by horse cart along cobblestone streets to lower Manhattan. For the next couple of hundred years, its wood frames commercial lofts that hold hat shops and daguerreotype salons. After demolition in the mid-2000s, the pine boards are salvaged by builders to clad the floors of the Park Avenue Armory and make gym bleachers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Basketball great Kobe Bryant will be honoured at this year's Oscars. The iconic sportsman, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, died on Sunday in a fatal helicopter crash.
 Bryant was an Oscar winner, having picked up the Best Animated Short Film statuette in 2018 for Dear Basketball - itself an adaptation of a poem, published by Bryant in 2015, about his retirement. When in the ceremony Bryant will be honoured remains unknown, though it's expected the basketball player will be namechecked during the In Memoriam section of the Academy Awards.
 Other tributes to Bryant have included the developers behind the basketball game NBA 2K20 putting a large banner on the game's home screen. It features a simple black and white photo of Bryant with "1978 - 2020" emblazoned below his name.
 This year's Oscars ceremony will be hostless. Instead, akin to the 2019 ceremony, numerous celebrities will present awards. They include Gal Gadot, Will Ferrell, Timothee Chalamet, Mark Ruffalo, and Zazie Beetz. Last year's acting winners - Olivia Colman, Regina King, Mahershala Ali, and Rami Malek - have also been announced as presenters.

The Round Rock school board denied a grievance earlier this month claiming Trustee Amber Feller used her position to pressure a district employee during a dispute last fall.
   
 Now the employee, Ingrid Johnson, and Feller are providing more details on the incident that has escalated to a grievance with the Texas Education Agency.
   
 Johnson said Feller has misrepresented the incident and has yet to apologize -- an action which Johnson called for in her grievance. Feller said she has apologized and felt it was appropriate to identify herself as a trustee during the incident.
   
 Video footage from a security camera shows Feller raising both of her middle fingers out of Johnson's view during the incident in October at Stony Point High School. It is the same footage trustees viewed before denying Johnson's grievance on Jan. 9.
   
 Johnson, who serves as a counselor at Stony Point High, was overseeing SAT testing as a College Board employee during the incident. She said Feller's son was violating testing policy by using his cellphone to make a call in the hallway during a break between testing sections.
   
 Following her conversation with Feller's son, Johnson said Feller entered the school, despite signs clearly stating it was prohibited. But Feller said Johnson never asked her to leave.
   
 Johnson said Feller announced several times she was a board member and provided Johnson her business card that included her title.
   
 "I felt that she was either trying to intimidate me or seeking special favors," Johnson said in an interview with the Leader. "If she was just in her parent hat, she wouldn't have had to tell me her title other than being a mom."
   
 Feller said she was trying to be transparent with Johnson by providing her business card and giving her title. She said the board has been advised to avoid contact with campus level staff that are not involved in the direct instruction of their children.
   
 "I am very sorry she interpreted it that way, but that was never my intention," Feller said of Johnson's allegation of seeking special treatment or favors.
   
 As the two debated, Johnson said Feller called several people including Superintendent Steve Flores and Daniel Pressley, senior chief of schools and innovation. While Flores didn't answer, Pressley spoke briefly with Feller.
   
 "When the administrator told me that they couldn't be of assistance because the individual was acting as an employee of the College Board, I politely hung up and left the facility," Feller said.
   
 The two are also at odds on whether Feller respected Johnson's personal space.
   
 Johnson said in her grievance and in her subsequent statements that Feller invaded her personal space and grabbed her belongings without permission. The security video shows Feller taking a photo of Johnson's lanyard while Johnson holds it, an action that Feller said she had permission to do.
   
 Following the dispute, Johnson said she viewed security video of Feller raising both of her middle fingers after Johnson disappears down the hall. In her statement, Feller said she regrets making the gesture, and that it was not meant for Johnson.
   
 "It was merely an outward expression of frustration that had built up," Feller said in a statement. "It was directed at the entire process, the unfair treatment my son had received, as well as how it significantly affected my son."
   
 Johnson said the meaning of the gesture is clear.
   
 "You flip off someone with both fingers, you're saying 'F you,'" she said.
   
 Following the incident, Feller said the College Board found through an investigation that the site administrator "did in fact treat my child unjustly." That followed with the College Board reinstating her son's SAT scores.
   
 But Johnson said she didn't receive any type of reprimand from the College Board due to her behavior that day.
   
 After meeting behind closed doors, the board on Jan. 9 denied Johnson's grievance. Trustees Chad Chadwell and Cory Vessa said they couldn't approve the grievance because the board couldn't enforce the relief requested.
   
 Johnson said she originally requested an apology and that Feller attend an anger management class at her own expense. She said she later withdrew the anger management request when she discovered the board would not have the power to enforce it.
   
 Last week, Johnson said she has filed another grievance with the Texas Education Agency. She said Feller should be removed from the board.
   
 "That's my opinion, and I'm entitled to it," Johnson said. "And it is even more so now that she is defending her behavior and that she didn't apologize."
   
 This week, Feller provided the Leader an email she sent to Johnson prior to the grievance hearing where she apologized to her.
   
 "I was understandably upset, as the unfair decision she made had the potential to greatly adversely affect my child, who had followed all rules and instructions," Feller said.

Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn responded Wednesday to the country's first confirmed case of coronavirus by ordering hospitals to report any suspected cases of the deadly bug and German airlines to retain contact details of all passengers from China. The Foreign Ministry has warned Germans against all travel to the central Chinese province of Hubei. A German military aircraft was sent to Hubei to begin the voluntary evacuation of German nationals from Wuhan, and the government was considering sending an Airbus with medical equipment on board for further evacuations.
 The first confirmed case on German soil was a 33-year-old employee at an auto parts supplier in Bavaria, believed to have been infected by a Chinese guest speaker from Wuhan at a training seminar. Three more workers at the same site have since been diagnosed with coronavirus.
 "It was inevitable that the virus would reach Germany, but we are well prepared," Spahn said. "We should all try and keep calm."

The factual finding is similarly cryptic and is irreconcilable with the law laid down in the _Novartis_ decision. It is also important to point out the factual matrix behind the SC’s findings on this issue in _Novartis_. One of the reasons why the SC rendered these findings was that _Novartis_ had asserted a prior genus patent (a European patent) against a generic company, alleging that the manufacture of IMATINIB MESYLATE by that company infringed the prior genus patent. The court was thus called upon to decide whether Novartis could then allege that IMATINIB MESYLATE was merely covered by the prior genus patent, but not disclosed by the same. The SC categorically and in no uncertain terms held that this could not be permitted.

The vendors that will take market share in 2020 will not only create a product that meets business requirements and workflow demands, but will also have all the business systems, communication tools and corporate culture to ensure customers are successful for years into the future.

JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Sheldon Gooch was serving life in prison with two 30-year-sentences added on when he received what he calls a ‘miracle pardon’ from former Governor Haley Barbour.Since that time he has used his life to serve as a minister, a businessman, and an author.It's been years since he was incarcerated, but Gooch says the problems today at Parchman are the same.“This kind of thing has been going on since prison came into existence. The only reason we know about it now is because of the cell phones. And I understand cell phones are not right -- in the prison it’s contraband -- but how would you all know were it not?” he said.When asked if the images coming out of the prisons is the same as it was when he was serving time, he replied, “All the time. All the time.”Every situation brings bloodshed, Gooch says, so a violent mindset grows among the inmates.“If I do get into that situation, I’ve got to go all the way, because there’s always recourse. There’s always retaliation. If not by you, then by your comrades,” Gooch said.Blackfist Outreach Ministries founders Keewin Grayer and Kenneth Daggans served 24 and 17 years behind bars respectively.Much like Gooch, they became leaders inside prison. Grayer says a problem bigger than the facility itself is the alleged hiring of corrupt guards, and that responsibility falls on the state.“I feel like the people that you hire, if I have a company and I hire employees, those employees are a reflection of my judgment,” he said.Kolean Sanders ministers to female inmates in the state prison system as well. She said the issues inmates face run the same across the board.“And there’s a lot of abuse there. There’s a lot of mental, emotional, physical and sexual abuse there. And they have the same issues that the men have,” she said.Copyright 2020 WLBT. All rights reserved.

Each municipality must collect a certain number of signatures based on the population. For a referendum to make the ballot, a petition with a number of signatures equal to at least 25% of the highest vote cast for any office in that municipality in the preceding general election must be filed with the local board of elections.
 Under Pennsylvania liquor code, changing liquor-sale status requires a referendum on the election ballot. Greene and Southampton petitioners are hoping to have a referendum on the May primary ballot, and St. Thomas Township petitioners are planning for a referendum on the November ballot.
 “We are working with local members of the community to get a referendum on the November ballot,” said Chris Hartman, spokesman for Rutter’s, which has a store on Lincoln Way West in St. Thomas Township. “We’ve had customers ask us why we can’t sell beer and wine.”
 If the number of eligible signatures on the petition is reached, the referendum will appear on the ballot and voters will determine if the liquor law will change.
 The three Franklin County municipalities are not trailblazers when it comes to seeking to “go wet.”
 “Generally speaking, we have seen a trend toward more municipalities going wet over the last several elections,” said Shawn Kelly, spokesman for the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.
 Kelly said even if the petitions are successful and the referendum appears on the ballot and passes, it doesn’t mean alcoholic-beverage sales will follow.
 By law, each county has a limited number of liquor licenses — a number determined by population, with one liquor license available for every 3,000 people.
 “When a municipality goes wet, the (liquor control board) does not issue more liquor licenses in the county if that county is at or over its retail liquor- license quota,” Kelly said. “A licensee would have to acquire an existing license from elsewhere in that county and bring it in (to the newly wet municipality).”

Brenda shared, "The idea for this song was something I read on a t-shirt while in Gatlinburg, TN. The shirt was a warning against drinking too much moonshine. It made me smile and resonated with me..so of course I wrote a song." The single will release on February 21st, 2020 and is available for pre-save and pre-order. Click Here for links.  Following the release of the single, Brenda Cay will release the music video.
