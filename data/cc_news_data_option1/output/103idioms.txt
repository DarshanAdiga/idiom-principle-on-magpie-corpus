SAN JOSE, Calif. -- If it seems like John Tortorella is getting asked a lot about Nathan Gerbe, there is a reason.
   
 It's because he is getting asked a lot about Gerbe, who has burst onto the scene for the Blue Jackets as one of the best "emergency" fill-ins in recent memory. Gerbe, a 32-year-old forward listed at just 5 feet 4 and 169 pounds, has given the Jackets a jolt neither they nor anybody else saw coming.
   
 He has provided experience, key goals, speed, grit and a relentless source of energy since being recalled from the Cleveland Monsters on Dec. 22 to replace Oliver Bjorkstrand (rib/oblique).
   
 "I have known him and I've watched him play for a long time," Tortorella said of Gerbe, who scored his second straight tying goal Tuesday in a 4-3 victory at the Anaheim Ducks. "I know the enthusiasm and I know the will that he brings to the game. That's a big part of why I think we've kept ourselves afloat here with such a crazy situation with some people in and out."
   
 Bjorkstrand isn't the only missing regular up front.
   
 The Blue Jackets are also lacking forwards Cam Atkinson (high ankle sprain), Josh Anderson (shoulder) and Alexandre Texier (lumbar stress fracture). Despite the absences, the Jackets have recorded points in 14 of the past 15 games (10-1-4) and have climbed into a tie in points (50) with the Philadelphia Flyers, who have the second wild card in the Eastern Conference by a tiebreaker.
   
 Gerbe, who earned an invitation to the American Hockey League's All-Star Game by leading the Monsters in scoring, has played a significant role in propelling the Jackets.
   
 He has three goals and two assists, and adds a whole lot of hustle to the lineup. He also reached a milestone during this junket, playing the 400th game of his NHL career in a 4-1 victory over the Florida Panthers on New Year's Eve at Nationwide Arena.
   
 "You just never know how it's going to mesh together, but with the character that's in this group … these guys play hard, so when you come here there's no choice," said Gerbe, who hadn't played in the NHL since two games with the Jackets in the 2017-18 season. "You've got to play hard, and that's the standard you want in an organization."
   
 Low-key 'Z'
   
 Other than watching Zach Werenski put the puck in the net -- something a lot of Blue Jackets have struggled to do this season -- Tortorella enjoys another part of the defenseman's goals.
   
 "You know what I like, is I watch him score a goal (and) there's not a lot of showboating, there's not whatever people do when they score goals," he said of Werenski, who scored two goals Tuesday against the Ducks and now leads all NHL defensemen with 15 goals.
   
 "I know you need to celebrate. I just like the way he handles himself. Still a young man in this league, I just think he understands what it means to be a pro."
   
 Energizer 'Jonesy'
   
 Seth Jones is known for logging a lot of minutes, but the 25-year-old defenseman outdid even himself late in the third period against the Ducks. Unable to get to the bench, he just stayed on the ice for a whopping 3:26 while Anaheim swarmed the Jackets' zone.
   
 "We couldn't get him off the ice," Tortorella said. "We had chances to get the puck out. We didn't. We just couldn't get him off the ice … but he didn't give in"
   
 Jones would prefer not to do it again.
   
 "It was survival mode, really," he said.
   
 During Jones' monster shift, the Blue Jackets lost all four faceoffs, saw four Ducks line changes -- including Ryan Getzlaf's top line twice -- and were outshot 5-0. They also iced the puck twice.
   
 "Hopefully that only happens one time this year," Jones said. "I think I went through like two of their lines, three of their lines. I started with Getzlaf and ended with Getzlaf, I think, so that's a first."

"That's speed, speed and skill," Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn said recently in explanation for how good Mahomes and the Chiefs have been in such situations. "They have a 4x100 relay at the wide receiver position. Their tight end is one of the best in the game. Of course, Patrick can make every throw in the book, extend plays with his legs. That makes them very dangerous."
 In the scenario against the Bears, the Chiefs picked a play that had mirror routes on each side with Tyreek Hill lined up from the slot on the left.
 Mahomes had to slide in the pocket to avoid pressure, and when he let go of the ball, Hill was about 4 yards from the top of his route. But by the time he turned around, the ball was there for Hill to make a 19-yard gain.
 "That throw made me say, 'Wow!'" said former Chiefs quarterback Rich Gannon, now a game analyst for CBS. "I watch a lot of throws, and when I look at a throw and go, 'Wow!' that's a pretty significant throw because I don't do 'Wow!' a lot. I've seen it and I've made some throws myself, so it takes a lot."
 It helps that Mahomes has options. Hill, Mecole Hardman and Sammy Watkins are three of the fastest wide receivers in the league, nicknamed the Legion of Zoom. Even tight end Travis Kelce is fast for a 260-pound player.
 On third-and-18 or more this season, Patrick Mahomes has completed 10 of 11 passes for almost 21 yards per attempt. He has five first downs, three touchdowns and a perfect passer rating of 158.3. Dylan Buell/Getty Images
 Then there's the strong-armed Mahomes, who is fearless yet forces few throws. On one of his third-and-long touchdowns -- a third-and-18 in Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts \-- Mahomes was flushed by pressure to his right and threw on the run for 27 yards to Byron Pringle.
 The play prompted Al Michaels, calling the game on TV for NBC, to shout, "Only Mahomes!"
 "We believe Pat can get us out of every situation," Watkins said. "I honestly think we can get a third-and-30 when it comes down to it. That's how we operate. We have so many plays for every situation. It's hard for the defense to have everything down. Then we have so many guys. It's kind of a situation where people have to pick their poison."
 But there's more to the Chiefs' third-and-long success. They don't thrive on those plays by accident -- they actually spend time working on those situations in practice.
 "We have times in training camp where it's just third-and-long, where we're third-and-11-plus and we're working against a defense knowing they're more in the prime position they want to be in to try to get stops," Mahomes said.
 The Chiefs also go into each game with options they like for third-and-long situations based on the particular opponent.
 "There's a lot in the playbook every week for third-and-long," Hill said.

Probably the last thing you want to think about now is Christmas music. I agree. But I think it's worthy of mentioning what kind of a holiday season Mariah Carey had.
 Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You" topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks during Christmas, and now has remained at the top for a third week, extending it into another decade. This song was released 25 years ago. It has never reached No. 1 prior to that.
 It's Carey's biggest hit to date, and that's saying a lot considering her track record.
 "All I Want For Christmas Is You" was penned by the star for her first Christmas album, "Merry Christmas." In fall 2019, a deluxe 25th anniversary edition of "Merry Christmas" was released to commemorate the album's success, particularly this single.
 It's only the second time a holiday song topped the Hot 100. The first was in 1958-59 when The Chipmunks, with David Seville, did so for four weeks with "The Chipmunk Song."
 For those keeping score, this puts Carey's total No. 1 singles at 19, which extends her record for the most among solo artists. It puts her within one of tying the record set by The Beatles.
 "All I Want For Christmas Is You" continues Carey's record run for total weeks occupying the No. 1 spot overall, to 81 weeks. The song also makes her the new record-holder for longest span between No.1s for any artist. The new mark is 29 years, four months and three weeks. She first hit No. 1 on Aug. 4, 1990, with her debut single, "Vision Of Love."
 Carey's hits include "Vision," "Love Takes Time," "I'll Be There," "Dreamlover," "Fantasy," "One Sweet Day," "Hero," "Honey" and "We Belong Together," just to scratch the surface. So how is it that "All I Want For Christmas Is You" is the biggest? The answer is simple: It's a recurring favorite every year. People get caught up in the magic of the holidays and no other song puts that feeling into your heart quite like this. She was brilliant for coming up with such an iconic sound that transcends the times. The week of Christmas alone, the song was streamed 54.4 million times in the U.S.
 "All I Want For Christmas Is You" has earned in upwards of $65 million in royalties over the last 25 years. That's remarkable! Then again, we're talking about Mariah Carey.

A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) Chairman and retired judge Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy said he was supposed to do a balancing act of keeping the tariffs at levels that are affordable to all categories of consumers and ensuring the power utilities do not incur major losses on account of various subsidies and the impact of rising costs. He claimed to be doing that to the extent possible and sounded confident of accomplishing the task.
 Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said though compensating farmers for the loss of value of their land due to the laying of High Tension (HT) lines did not come under its purview, the APERC would try to redress that grievance.
 For this, the issues arising from the Electricity Act, 2003, and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, were to be sorted out by the Central and State governments, he said.
 Speaking at the APERC’s public hearing on the Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) of Discoms and proposed retail tariffs for 2020-21 here on Thursday, Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said he was for reasonable tariffs and asserted that the Commission would do justice to the consumers within its limits as it was up to the government to frame rules while some matters were pending in courts.
 ## First point of contact
 The first point of contact for the aggrieved farmers were district Collectors and the complaints could be escalated to the next level if no solutions were found.
 AP-Transco Joint Managing Director K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu said the A.P. power utilities owed ₹16,000 crore to the power producers and their losses amounted to ₹29,000 crore. The total operating expenses stood around ₹8,000 crore.
 The government had given ₹11,000 crore to the Discoms in the last six months.
 CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao said the APERC should take stock of the renewable Power Purchase Agreements which entailed a huge burden on the exchequer.
 Federation of Farmers’ Associations leader Cherukuri Venugopal said farmers were in dire straits due to the loss caused by HT lines passing through their fields and the grey areas thereof were to be removed to render justice to them.
 APERC members P. Rama Mohan and P. Raghu, Discoms’ CMDs H. Haranatha Rao (SPDCL) and J. Padma Janardhan Reddy (CPDCL), NREDCAP MD S. Ramana Reddy and CPDCL Directors K. Santosha Rao and Balasubrahmanyam were among those present.

Working directly with the public has also been a fascination. For the final phase of "City of Sunshine", the artists distributed pictures of the installation to everyone who had donated lamps, underlining its environmental theme. "We Will Fly No Matter What" (2012) was created with 37,000 primary- school students across Taiwan. The artists and their team spent a year travelling to classrooms across the island, encouraging children to paint pictures, which they then turned into an animated bird. Elsewhere they have collaborated with performance artists and musicians, as well as choreographer Chou Shu-yi and dancers Tien Hsiao-tzu and Lin Yu-ju.
 Despite Chang Keng-hau's death, the group's enthusiasm for exploring and break new boundaries seems inexhaustible. "It's a constant struggle to think outside the box," says Chang Geng-hwa. "Art is not merely an object. It must have impact."

Dont get swayed by motivated rumours on NRC, says TN CM Chennai, Jan 9 PTI Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami on Thursday asserted in the Assembly that the interests of minorities would be fully protected by his government and urged them to not be swayed by politically motivated rumours on the National Register of Citizens. Winding up the discussion on the motion of thanks to the governors address, Palaniswami said the House witnessed a debate on the NRC for about two days. Citing the assurance made in the House by his colleague, Revenue Minister R B Udhayakumar that minorities will not be affected in any way vis-a-vis the NRC, he said his party led regimes have all along served as a fortification for the minority people since the days of AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran and later Amma, J Jayalalithaa. I would like to assert that this government of Amma will continue to be a fortification for the minority people, following the footsteps of the two great leaders. Further, he said,the minority people hence need not have even an iota of doubt or apprehension and not believe rumours spread with political motives. Quoting a saying of Dravidian icon C N Annadurai, he said those against his party and the government will be elbowed out with the peoples support. On January 7, speaking on the NRC, Udhayakumar had said no order had been received from the Centre mandating its implementation. Even if such a directive is to come and when it is implemented, even if a single person from the minority community is affected, the first voice against it will be raised by the AIADMK. Their rights will be protected. This is the truth, he said. DMK had supported an amendment in Parliament in 2003 to the Citizenship Act, he said, adding such tweaking envisaged the maintenance of a National Register of Indian Citizens by the Centre and setting up a National Registration Authority. You Congress-DMK alliance regime at the Centre initiated it and now you blame the AIADMK, he said,seeking to turn the tables on the principal opposition party which held protests over the CAA-NRC in the state..

AUSTIN, Texas -- Retired state employees Vickey Benford, 63, and Joan Caldwell, 61, are Golden Rollers, a group of the over-50 set that gets out on assorted bikes -- including trikes for adults they call "three wheels of awesome" -- for an hour of trail riding and camaraderie.
 "I love to exercise, and I like to stay fit," said Caldwell, who tried out a recumbent bike, a low-impact option that can be easier on the back. "It keeps me young."
 Benford encouraged Caldwell to join the organized rides, which have attracted more than 225 riders at city rec centers and senior activity centers. The cyclists can choose from a small, donated fleet of recumbent bikes, tandem recumbents and tricycles.
 "With seniors, it's less about transportation and more about access to the outdoors, social engagement and quality of life," said Christopher Stanton, whose idea for Golden Rollers grew out of the Ghisallo Cycling Initiative, a youth biking nonprofit he founded in 2011.
 But that's not all, according to brain scientists. They point to another important benefit: Exercising both body and brain can help people stay healthier longer.
 The new thinking about aging considers not just how long one lives, but how vibrant one stays later in life.
 "If you're living, you want to be living well," said Tim Peterson, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. "Most people who were interested in life span and were studying genes -- which control life span -- switched to 'healthspan.'"
 "Healthspan," a coinage now gaining traction, refers to the years that a person can expect to live in generally good health -- free of chronic illnesses and cognitive decline that can emerge near life's end. Although there's only so much a person can do to delay the onset of disease, there's plenty that scientists are learning to improve your chances of a better healthspan.
 The work takes on special resonance in light of a new report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that life expectancy in the United States has decreased in recent years. A rise in midlife mortality (ages 25 to 64) has dragged down the overall expectancy.
 "The idea is to make people productive, healthier and happier longer and more capable taking care of themselves," said Andreana Haley, a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who is among this breed of researchers working to understand healthspan. "We now live a long time with a lot of chronic diseases, and it's not fun. It's costly -- in terms of productivity, caregiving responsibilities, cost of health care."
 Haley, who collaborates with exercise physiologists, nutritionists, behavioral neuroscientists and physicians, said researchers from many other disciplines are also studying healthspan, such as nurses, speech pathologists and pharmacists.
 Their work is inspired by an aging U.S. population with changing needs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 10,000 people a day turn 65, the nation's fastest-growing population segment.
 "We have a lot of people who will need to be taken care of in the next 50 years," she said, "and fewer young people to do the care."
 Haley, with UT's Aging and Longevity Center, focuses her work on midlife, which she defines as ages 40 to 60, a time when health choices can have a big impact on older years. She's especially interested in brain health.
 Her team is collaborating with UT's Human Laser Lab to pilot the use of low- level light therapy to increase brain energy and improve cognitive performance.
 Because of this close brain-body connection, any degeneration in the brain affects not only cognitive function but also areas that control weight, appetite, personality, mood and blood pressure.
 Online games and brain-training exercises have become popular as another way to keep the brain sharp.
 However, research on brain training reflects mixed results, including a study published last year in the journal Neuropsychologia, which "calls into question the benefit of cognitive training beyond practice effects."
 Still, aging experts urge people as they age to work to keep mentally active, as well as physically active, to lengthen their healthspan.
