Private label products have been an integral part of the retail shelves.

The market is also predicted to take massive leaps on the back of the unplanned growth rates of M&HCVs, LCVs, two-wheeled and three-wheeled vehicles, and passenger automobiles. Moreover, strict policies of governments regarding safety and emissions could help the market to advance significantly.

Boccia aludió al artículo 120 de la Constitución, que prohíbe taxativamente "instituir aduanas de importación o exportación o al paso de personas" entre regiones en Italia.
 La región de Cerdeña (sur) propone crear "pasaportes sanitarios", es decir, certificados de negativo al coronavirus para los turistas que lleguen a la isla desde el 3 de junio, cuando en Italia habrá libertad de movimiento entre regiones.
 La idea, también barajada por la otra gran isla de Italia, Sicilia (sur), tiene por objetivo limitar las posibilidades de contagio, pues estas dos regiones sureñas están entre las menos afectadas por la pandemia, mucho más virulenta en el norte del país.
 La isla sarda tiene el nivel más bajo de transmisión del virus de Italia (0,24) y es la más interesada en promocionarse como "destino seguro" para salvar sus demandadas playas en el verano, cuando esperan recibir 2,5 millones de turistas italianos y extranjeros.
 El presidente de Cerdeña, Christian Solinas, autonomista, lamentó las palabras del ministro y las calificó "una inútil letanía centralista para asegurar la supremacía prepotente del Estado".
 "A pocos días del 3 de junio esperábamos del ministro una propuesta de solución clara sobre la reapertura entre regiones", denunció en declaraciones recogidas por los medios locales.
 La propuesta será tratada en la Conferencia Estado-Regiones de mañana aunque se da por descontado que el Gobierno, que tiene la última palabra, la rechazará.
 Además el presidente de Cerdeña ha encontrado la oposición de varias regiones, como la Liguria (noroeste), cuyo presidente, Giovanni Toti, cree que ese pasaporte solo sería "burocracia" que acabaría penalizando el turismo.
 Pero también ha mantenido un duro desencuentro con Beppe Sala, el alcalde de Milán, capital de la región más afectada por la pandemia, Lombardía, que considera la propuesta "una discriminación".
 "Yo no iría de vacaciones a un lugar en el que me piden un test de negatividad al virus. Además no es tan sencillo acceder a estas pruebas. Creo equivocado discriminar a los italianos por su procedencia", criticó el alcalde desde sus redes sociales.
 Italia se encuentra en plena fase de desescalada y desde el próximo 3 de junio, tras casi tres meses, se permitirá el movimiento entre regiones y se abrirán las fronteras exteriores a ciudadanos de la Unión Europea, que no deberán cumplir cuarentena.
 Preocupa sin embargo la situación en Lombardía y Piamonte (norte) por el repunte de las infecciones reportado en los últimos días, por lo que no se descarta un "Plan B" para su reapertura.
 Se espera que el próximo viernes el Ministerio de Salud ofrezca los datos sobre la curva epidemiológica a raíz de las aperturas del pasado 18 de mayo, cuando se permitió la reanudación de la práctica totalidad de sectores del país y el desconfinamiento de la gente.
 Desde que se detectara el primer caso de coronavirus local, el 21 de febrero, Italia ha sumado 231.139 contagios, de los que 33.072 han perdido la vida, según los últimos datos de la Protección Civil.
