“The chemistry that we built over that season is something unmatched, and that still carries on today in 2020,” said Martel, now a real-estate agent and investor in Montreal.
 The group held a pseudo-reunion in Richmond a couple of summers ago, and UR associate head coach Rob Jones recalls Chris Mooney, the Spiders’ coach since 2005, beaming as if a proud father among a tight group of successful sons.
 “I tell this to all of our players, and I them all of the time, it means more to coach Mooney that they stay in touch with one another and they’re involved in each other’s lives than anything,” said Jones, who was an assistant on the Sweet 16 team. “Being around him for as many years as I have, it’s just one of those things where I can tell how much that really means to him.”
 Anderson was named 2008 A-10 rookie of the year, 2010 A-10 player of the year, and three times made all-conference. He said when those honors were announced by the league, his teammates “were genuinely way more happier for me than I was for myself. That family was really, really special.”
 That Richmond team beat eighth-ranked Purdue in a November tournament, handled Wake Forest at the Robins Center, and won at Arizona State and Seton Hall before going 13-3 in an A-10 that included Xavier and Temple, regular NCAA tournament participants in that era. They shifted to other leagues. UR won the 2011 A-10 championship, beating Dayton in the title game at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, N.J.
 As a No. 12 seed, Richmond opened NCAA tournament play in Denver and upset fifth-seeded Vanderbilt, and then eliminated Morehead State, which shocked Louisville in the previous round. UR finished 29-8, falling 77-57 to second- ranked Kansas in the Sweet 16.
 “That whole season, it was magical,” said Martel.
 Four of the players on that team are assistant coaches: Anderson at Liberty, Kevin Smith at Campbell, Kevin Hovde at San Francisco, and Dan Geriot with the Cleveland Cavaliers.
 “There was a lot of IQ and high accountability on that court,” said Anderson, the second-leading scorer in program history (2,165 points).
 Both were required to effectively play Mooney's complex match-up zone, which limited opponents to an average of 61.2 points, and 40.5% shooting, according to Anderson. He and 6-foot-10 Justin Harper, a second-round pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, were the two Spiders who regularly scored in double-figures. About a half-dozen members of that team went on to play professionally, with Harper spending parts of three seasons in the NBA.
 Richmond advanced to the 2010 NCAA tournament as an at-large entry, and was sent home by St. Mary's 80-71 in the first round. The 2010-11 Spiders started four seniors, with a fifth in reserve. Early in their careers, those seniors played on inexperienced teams that struggled.
 "It's not like they jumped on a moving train," Mooney said in 2011. "These guys have taken something that was fairly ordinary, and maybe below average, and made it something very special. That's not an easy thing to do.
 "Not only have they done that, but they've done it with dignity and represented the university in a great way."
 Those Spiders, Jones noted, dealt with failure, progress, and then exceptional success. That, Martel sees now, turned out to be a bond-tightening evolution.

But with the BRF (including Harry at the time) they’re all in each other’s faces about news cycles and headlines and press coverage. Harry at least (and likely Meghan by then) would’ve known that so I can understand why they shouldn’t have said anything at the wedding. That said, the York response was uncalled for. Let’s face it - deep down even the Grifting York’s must’ve understood that the general public reaction to Eugenie’s wedding was “what, why are we paying for this over the top farce” so they decided to lash out in their usual racist and classist way.

 By Amy Tennery and Frank Pingue
 Aug 11 (Reuters) - Two of the five wealthiest U.S. college sports conferences postponed the fall football season on Tuesday because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a critical blow to both an iconic American cultural tradition and a multibillion-dollar entertainment industry.
 The Big Ten and Pac-12 powerhouse members include perennial national football title contenders like the University of Michigan, Ohio State University and the University of Southern California. The Big Ten suspended fall sports, while the Pac-12 said it would not hold any sports competitions for the remainder of the year.
 The move leaves the future of college football being played at all this fall in significant doubt as college officials grow ever more wary of their ability to have thousands of unpaid players practice and compete without jeopardizing their safety and contributing to the spread of a highly communicable disease.
 "We know that this is a difficult day for our student-athletes, and our hearts go out to them and their families," Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott said in a statement. "We have made clear that all of their scholarships will be guaranteed."
 The conference said it was also calling on the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the governing body for college sports, to extend an additional year of eligibility for student-athletes.
 "The mental and physical health and welfare of our student-athletes has been at the center of every decision we have made regarding the ability to proceed forward," Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said, adding that there is "too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks" to move forward with the fall sports season.
 Pac-12 said it "would consider a return to competition for impacted sports" after the New Year, while the Big Ten will weigh "the possibility of competition in the spring," for fall athletic programs.
 Earlier this year a study conducted for ESPN by Washington University, in St. Louis, said the 65 schools that make up the "Power Five" conferences would collectively lose more than $4 billion in football revenue, with at least $1.2 billion of that due to lost ticket revenue.
 'VERY DISAPPOINTED'
 The University of Nebraska, a Big Ten school, said it was "very disappointed" by the conference's decision.
 "We continue to strongly believe the absolute safest place for our student athletes is within the rigorous safety protocols, testing procedures, and the structure and support provided by Husker Athletics," school officials said in a written statement.
 "Our student-athletes and coaches want to compete," said University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh. "We have shown over the weeks since returning to campus that we could meet the challenge and provide our student- athletes the opportunity of a fall football season."
 Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said that while disappointed, "we certainly understand that this was the time that we had to pull the plug."
 University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Oregon, both members of the Pac-12, said they supported the decision.
 "While the decision was difficult, it is consistent with our shared commitment to the health and well-being of Cal's student-athletes, coaches and staff," said Cal Chancellor Carol Christ. "Our hearts go out to the student-athletes."
 The postponements were likely to complicate the professional football landscape, with the annual NFL Scouting Combine and draft regularly held in the spring.
 U.S. President Donald Trump advocated for college football to be played this year and suggested that student athletes are strong enough to withstand the novel coronavirus.
 "We want to get football in colleges. These are young, strong people. They won't have a big problem with the China virus. So we want to see college football start," Trump said during a news conference at the White House.
 While a number of professional athletes have recovered from COVID-19, there are concerns among sports medical professionals that young, healthy people can get sick and have lingering health problems, such as heart, lung and cognitive issues.
 The University of Massachusetts, which plays as an independent, canceled its 2020 football season on Tuesday, citing COVID-19. But it left open the possibility of competition later in the academic calendar.
 The Ivy League said last month that intercollegiate sports would not resume in the fall semester, and the University of Connecticut last week canceled "all competition for the 2020-21 school year" for its football program.
 The Atlantic Coast Conference said that it would "continue to make decisions based on medical advice, inclusive of our Medical Advisory Group, local and state health guidelines."
 Southeastern Conference Commissioner Greg Sankey said he looked forward "to learning more about the factors that led the Big Ten and Pac-12 leadership to take these actions today." "We will continue to further refine our policies and protocols for a safe return to sports," he said.

Barco, a provider of professional visualisation, introduces its new generation RGB laser rear-projection video walls and reinforces its commitment to the mission-critical control room market. The newest generation offering strengthens the value proposition of rear-projection technology as the reliable, sustainable and long-lifetime visualisation solution, and will be available for both new installations and to upgrade the installed base. As a broad visualisation solution supplier, Barco offers rear-projection, LCD and LED indoor video walls, allowing to optimise the visualisation outcome - depending on the specific application and customer needs. Key visualisation technology For mission-critical control rooms, rear-projection remains a key visualisation technology especially for mid- to large-size control rooms that work with dashboards and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) content typically within the utilities and rail transportation markets. The Barco RGB Laser ODL series, with its unique value proposition, was introduced in 2016 and has been the flagship solution ever since, winning multiple industry awards. The ODL series now gets a major update which further establishes the RGB Laser series as the premium solution With the introduction of this newest generation laser engine, the ODL series now gets a major update which further establishes the RGB Laser series as the premium solution in the market. This will strengthen and safeguard the unique value proposition of rear-projection cubes by further extending the lifetime, protecting long-term serviceability commitments up to 10 years, and offering a sustainable solution considering the environment and ergonomics. Mission-critical control rooms The high-brightness RGB Laser engine allows control rooms to operate in the optimal conditions for the end users. The unique Sense X calibration system automatically and continuously adjusts brightness and colour over the complete wall during the entire lifetime, making sure the displayed images reduce eye fatigue in 24/7 applications. Additionally, no heat is radiated out of the screens, which further optimises the ergonomics for the operators and simplifies the room temperature control systems. The next-generation laser engine introduces new laser banks, improving the light source lifetime in different operational modes. The guaranteed 10 years of maintainability secures the system for the future, which is instrumental for mission-critical control rooms. The accompanying WallConnect software has further evolved, improving the user experience during setup, configuration, operation and maintenance. Remote management and monitoring Multiple screen options are available to deliver the optimum result depending on the application Along with the ODL-series' motorised 7-axis alignment, this makes the installation process smoother and simpler. The system is also future proof and ready for remote management and monitoring, optimising the availability and lifetime within the mission critical environments. The new engine will be available within the full RGB Laser portfolio, covering 70" to 80" sizes and supporting both FHD and SXGA+ resolutions. Multiple screen options are available to deliver the optimum result depending on the application, control room environment and budget. Furthermore, existing customers can upgrade their installed base of lamp & LED cubes, which means a complete technology refresh can be accomplished while keeping the mechanical structure and screens. This not only lowers the cost and timeframe of the refurbishment, but also reduces waste and can often be accomplished without any operational interruption. Latest projection technology Being able to upgrade video walls (running already for more than 10 years) with the latest projection technology at a reduced cost, for another 10 years of service, is a key advantage of rear projection. The ODL series also received the 'Barco Eco Product label A' as it further reduces the environmental footprint. Barco's stringent ecoscoring scores energy efficiency, material usage, packaging/logistics and end-of-life processes in line with the ISO14021 standard. "By introducing the next- generation RGB Laser ODL series, Barco is again breaking the bar in the rear- projection cube market," says Jay Badvel, Product Manager at Barco. "With this new engine, we go far beyond excelling at the technical level. We further enhance the lifetime, secure the reliability and lower the environmental footprint. The upgrade capability, reusing a large part of the infrastructure, in combination with the modularity, repairability and refurbishment options, further contributes to a true circular economy." The next generation RGB Laser ODL series are available for shipments starting August 2020.
