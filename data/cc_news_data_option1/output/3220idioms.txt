So what does it mean to create space for changing opinions in our interpersonal relationships? To start with, it means sacrificing the triumph of an “I told you so.” As much as we all like to feel vindicated, we have to ask ourselves what matters most — shaming others because they weren’t perfect enough to have been right all along or building coalition-consensus around ideas that can genuinely change lives.

If our principles extend beyond individual candidates, policy positions and party lines, they will inevitably lead us to change our minds every once in a while. And creating meaningful, long-lasting change around the issues we care about will require us to offer ourselves and others that little bit of leeway.

The Rome Floyd Chamber has used its Business Expo to showcase the diversity of the business community for years.
 As the 2020 event, set for Nov. 5, draws near, the chamber is busy making plans for a virtual expo in case the COVID-19 outbreak prevents the in-person event at the Forum River Center from taking place.
 Thomas Kislat, director of membership and entrepreneurial development, said the day of the show was moved from a Friday to a Thursday because he is expecting even more participation from vendors this year.
 “We know you’ve got to expect the unexpected now. Things can change any day,” Kislat said. “We know how important our flagship event is and we owe it to our members not to postpone or cancel the event — so Plan B is to do an online version of it.”
 For the time being, Kislat said he is planning to hold a live expo and a virtual expo at the same time.
 Braden Keith, principal at Romega Digital, is consulting with Kislat and the chamber in the development of a virtual expo.
 Keith told members of the Small Business Action Committee this week that he is excited to take on the project. He praised President & CEO Jeanne Krueger, and the rest of the chamber administrative team, as forward-thinking regarding the use of technology to promote local small businesses.
 “You’re probably aware of Shop Chamber, which has been vital to getting businesses online,” Keith said, referring to a marketing campaign. “Now here they are, thinking ahead again.”
 The business expo has always been a major event for networking, giving small business owners and managers a chance to get better acquainted with their peers across the community.
 “I know everyone looks forward to this time every year but, in this day and age, it’s completely up in the air as to how that might be expected,” Keith said. “Your chamber is preparing for all possibilities.”
 In a normal year, the business expo would have between 100 and 120 businesses come together in the Forum to show off their products and capabilities. This year, Romega Digital has been asked to help find a way to transfer that physical face-to-face contact into a more virtual realm.
 Keith explained that the challenges are real and the timeline is tight but he is confident that his staff, working with chamber staff, can pull it off.
 “I love the chamber, I love this downtown, I love all your businesses so much. I want this to be as successful online as it would be in person,” Keith said.
 Kislat said that an advantage to having a virtual presence is that it goes beyond highlighting to Romans the goods and services available in Rome. It will showcase Rome business to the rest of the country and anyone else around the world.
 As far as what online visitors might see, Keith said the image of 100 businesses all gathered under one roof remains an important aspect of the imagery.
 As a visitor zooms in, Keith said, he would expect to be able to show off any particular business’s logo and emulate being right there inside an expo booth with the employee.
 “Within this booth, we’re going to provide access to your business,” Keith said. “It’s kind of hard to send people home with a swag bag, but I’m sure you’ve got some marketing materials that you’d want to provide.”
 He’s also seeking to create an online calendar that would allow visitors online to schedule an appointment to talk with a business owner via Zoom, Google Hangouts or whatever tool a specific business is comfortable using.
 The Shop Chamber initiative is already going strong, providing small business members a portal to sell their merchandise without having to develop their own website.
 Any chamber member can join the campaign and sell their products through the chamber site online.
 “We’re begging for more vendors to come on to the platform,” Keith said. “It’s almost like an Amazon for Rome. So, as we’re building out the Shop Chamber platform, as we’re getting closer to expo, if you’re a Shop Chamber vendor we’re going to link directly from the expo site to the Shop Chamber page.”
 Keith said he and the chamber are both making significant investments in technology to help other small businesses in the county.
 Krueger said the success of the business expo is critical because it helps the chamber fund its Shop Rome campaign, which steps up its activity during the holiday season.
 “The expo has always been a great event and we want to continue on with that, but to be able to do this (virtual) element is huge for us,” Krueger said. “We want to do it in person but we want to give people both options, whatever their comfort level might be.”

Regarding the grading efforts to make Accra the cleanest city, she said, “I will give it 85 per cent because at the end of the day you saw the 100 per cent we did during the lockdown.”      But her comments has attracted criticism from a section of Ghanaians including the Member of Parliament for Tamale North Constituency, Alhassan Suhuyini, who said on TV3’s New Day Thursday, August 13, that the minister was dishonest in the comments.      Alhaji Suhuyini said: “This is dishonesty because you move around and bins are not even everywhere,” adding that the president should be blamed for this development.      Sharing his perspectives on this matter, the CONIWAS boss, Mr Apoya, said the 100 per cent target “is achievable. The measures that have been put in place to achieve the target is good at it.

Bloomberg) -- The U.K. government’s plan to get people back to work to fuel the economic recovery is under threat from a rising childcare problem.
 Financial difficulties are putting the survival of many childcare facilities at risk, potentially forcing parents to drop out of the labor force to stay at home. Not only does that hit household incomes and consumer spending, it could also undo years of progress in getting more women into work -- with long-term consequences for growth.
 A survey last month by childcare.co.uk showed that a third of centers believe they may close permanently -- twice as many as in a similar poll in April -- with the loss of 560,000 places.
 Jo Verrill, the managing director of Ceeda, an independent childcare research company, says the typically busy summer months when schools close are crucial for operators to replenish their coffers.
 Not this year though -- with parents’ incomes under pressure and unemployment rising, those that are open are at half capacity. U.K. childcare costs for parents are among the highest in the world.
 “The true measure is going to be when furlough support ends, to see whether occupancy bounces back early enough for providers to weather the storm,” Verrill said.
 Mothers are likely to be worse affected than fathers. Women have already been worse hit than men by the pandemic because they’re more heavily employed in hospitality, leisure and tourism which have been crushed by the crisis.
 The Institute for Fiscal Studies found that mothers are more likely to have quit or lost their job during lockdown. Pay differentials are widening, according to reports by poverty charity Turn2us and the Women’s Budget Group, which scrutinizes the gender impact of public policy.
 A record 72.4% of women were employed at the end of last year in the U.K., and a reversal of that trend has implications deeper than equality goals. It would be one example of what Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey calls “scarring” that will slow the recovery.
 International Monetary Fund research last year showed that higher female employment boosts economic growth and productivity by bringing different skills and ideas to the workplace.
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is pushing on with plans to wind down furlough programs in the autumn. Yet half of employed women don’t have the childcare provision they would need to go back, according to campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed.
 Buying Space
 The government does provide subsidies, and has given extra relief during the crisis. A spokesperson for the Department for Education said it has been ‘block-buying’ childcare places for the rest of this year, regardless of attendance levels.
 Yet local authorities have also been told that they should only fund closed childcare facilities in the autumn if they are shut for public health reasons.
 Economist Jerome De Henau at the Women’s Budget Group says the government should be spending 55 billion pounds ($72 billion) a year to make care widely available for all children.
 Instead it’s allocated about a tenth of that, and focused its efforts on very young children.
 De Henau says that could undermine Johnson’s plans for an economic revival led by infrastructure construction, which pre-date the virus but have gained added urgency now.
 “They’re missing the point if they want to generate good employment and permanent employment in large numbers,” he said. “Any recovery plan that is about creating jobs will have to deal with this childcare question.”
