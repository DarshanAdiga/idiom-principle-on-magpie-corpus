 # Green Bay man indicted on child porn and sex trafficking charges

 Green Bay Press-Gazette
 GREEN BAY - A Green Bay man has been charged in federal court with producing child pornography and sex trafficking of a child.
 Darryl K. Green, 53, faces two counts of child pornography and sex trafficking of the same child across different states between April and July 13, according to the indictment filed Tuesday.
 Green could serve life in prison if convicted of both charges. He would be required to register as a sex offender.
 Authorities developed the case due to Project Safe Childhood, a national initiative launched in 2016 to combat cases of child sexual exploitation and abuse.
