The all-time leading receiver in the history of Murray State football, Powell tore up the turf of Roy Stewart Stadium from 2010-2013. The St. Louis native set the program’s career records for receiving yards with 2,650, touchdowns with 29 and 100-plus yard games with 10 and is second all-time in receptions with 208.
 In 2012, Powell had arguably the best season by any receiver in Murray State history when he caught a program single-season record 94 passes for another single-season record of 1,213 yards while scoring 13 touchdowns, the second- most in a single season all-time. In addition, Powell notched six games of 100-yards or more as a junior, which is also a MSU single-season record. He led the Racers in receptions in touchdowns in each of his final three seasons and in receiving yards in his final two.
 Powell finished his career as a two-time All-OVC selection at both a wide receiver and return specialist and as a two-time first-team all-purpose All- American. Following his career at Murray State, Powell was drafted in the sixth round of the 2014 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals. He spent four seasons in the NFL playing for the Cardinals, the New York Jets, the Buffalo Bills, the Oakland Raiders and the Jacksonville Jaguars.
 After his retirement from professional football in 2017, Powell helped develop the mobile app, Politiscope, which “aims to help educate the voter population by providing transparent, truthful political information in a centralized location and offer a reliable alternative to biased and fake news.” Due to the success of the app, earlier this year Powell and his co-founder, Jackson White, were named to Forbes Magazine’s prestigious “30 Under 30” list in the “Law & Policy” category.

Last week, a university student contacted Ardern's office to say Falloon had sent her an unsolicited message. That information was passed on to National Party leader Judith Collins, who met with Falloon on Monday. Police also investigated the incident.
 Collins said Falloon first told police the message had been sent by accident and later told her there were no other similar incidents. But she said on Tuesday two more women had come forward with similar complaints about being sent pornographic images of women, and more complaints were likely to follow.
 “I think it’s very obvious that he’s lied to police and a lot of other people,” Collins said.
 She said police had told her they were likely to reopen their investigation into Falloon in light of the new information.
 Falloon, 37, was not available for comment Tuesday and police did not immediately confirm if they planned to investigate further. Police had earlier said they didn't intend to press charges.
 Under New Zealand law, a person can face up to two years in jail if they are found guilty of posting a digital communication with the intention of harming a victim.

Now, let us talk about the external front. The recent intrusion by the Chinese army tells us two things. The first is that our defence system has still not been developed to our requirements. Second, we Indians easily forget our defeats. Those of our generation who were born and grew up in the 1960s were apprehensive about China in the early stages. The defeat of 1962 was excruciating, all along. The recent events in Galwan Valley have shown that even though today’s India may not be the same as in 1962, it was not as successful as expected. To change this, it is necessary to strengthen the economy of our country. Needless to say that most strategic campaigns in the world were motivated by economic pursuits. Beijing’s ruling class thinks that the time has come to dominate not only its neighbours but the US as well.

Un bărbat a rămas șocat când a aflat că soția lui a rămas însărcinată și a dat vina pe pisică, care s-a jucat cu prezervativele și le-a găurit. Cei doi aveau deja un copil și plănuiau să își extindă din nou familia, dar au renunțat în momentul în care a venit pandemia, conform Daily Star. Femeia lua pastile anticoncepționale, dar a întrerupt tratamentul și cei doi au început să folosească prezervative. După testul pozitiv, bărbatul a verificat mai bine prezervativele din sertar și a văzut că aveau găuri mici, făcute de gheruțele pisicii. „Credeam că prezervativul va fi suficient, dar apoi a intervenit pisica noastră. În primele luni după ce am adoptat-o, mă trezeam dimineața și toate dulapurile din bucătărie erau deschise”, a spus bărbatul. Bărbatul a văzut bucățele mici din ambalajul de prezervativ lângă dulap, dar nu a făcut pe moment conexiunea cu pisica. Abia după trei săptămâni, când soția sa a început să aibă simptome de sarcină, și-a dat seama că pisica se jucase cu toate prezervativele din sertar. „Dintr-o dată m-a izbit... M-am dus la sertar și toate prezervativele aveau urme de gheruțe și de dinți pe ele”, a spus bărbatul. Cuplul a trecut peste șoc și se pregătește acum pentru venirea pe lume a copilului. „Abia aștept să îi explic fiului sau fiicei mele că îi datorează existența pisicii”, a spus viitorul tată.

Many investors' stock portfolios lost value for the first half of 2020. However, even with its significant risk my 2020 "Living Dangerously Portfolio" managed, to my chagrin, to do surprisingly well.
   
 Equity investors must cope with normal and sometimes higher market volatility, but they don't have to deal with high volatility and a high probability that a speculative stock's price will collapse. However, like the lottery, speculative stocks will have a few big winners. But few investors have the skill to find these "needles in the haystack," or the discipline to stick with them.
   
 A problem with speculative stocks is their share prices are often based on the hope of outstanding far future earnings, not the reality of their near future ones. I label these stocks as "dangerous." Since these stocks' prices are based on hoped-for future earnings, they are literally "priced for perfection" and perfection is rarely achieved.
   
 I've warned readers about dozens of dangerous stocks. From time-to-time, I construct from them a Living Dangerously Portfolio and report on it quarterly. For 2020, I started a new portfolio with all the dangerous stocks reviewed here from 2016-2019 that are still publicly traded; three have gone bankrupt or private. I assumed a $10,000 investment in each publicly traded stock at the price in the column when it was reviewed.
   
 How has this portfolio of seven stocks done from their purchase dates, and for the first half of 2020?
   
 The portfolio ended the first half at $111,852 up 59.8% measured from the purchase date of each stock. It closed 2019 at $85,158. Thus, it soared 31.3% for 2020 as compared to the 3.1% loss of the S&P; 500 and the NASDAQ's 12.1% gain. Since their purchase dates, three of these stocks fell significantly in price, and three others are no longer publicly traded or bankrupt. Even given this particular portfolio's gains, dangerous stocks (remember the bankruptcies) aren't prudent investments.
   
 Let's review the publicly traded stocks.
   
 • In November 2016, Alarm.com Holdings (ALRM) was reviewed; its price was $29. Its closing 2019 price was $42.97, and its closing first half price was $64.81.
   
 • In February 2017, Weibo (WB) was reviewed; its price was $54.39. Its closing 2019 price was $46.35, and its closing first half price was $33.60.
   
 • In September 2017, AppFolio (APPF) was reviewed; its price was $45. Its closing 2019 price was $109.95, and its closing first half price was $162.71.
   
 • In February 2018, TAL Education Group (TAL) was reviewed; its price was $32. Its closing 2019 price was $48.20, and its closing first half price was $68.47.
   
 • In May 2018, Abiomed (ABMD) was reviewed; its price was $388. Its closing 2019 price was $170.59, and its closing first half price was $241.56.
   
 • In September 2018, CareDx (CDNA) was reviewed; its price was $26. Its closing 2019 price was $21.57, and its closing first half price was $35.43.
   
 • In February 2019, Tactile Systems Technology (TCMD) was reviewed; its price was $70. Its closing 2019 price was $67.51, and its closing first half price was $41.43.

WESTPORT -- Allyson Duarte was a few years into pursuing her acting career in New York City when the COVID-19 pandemic sidelined her plans.
 But the Westport native saw it as an opportunity to found a theatre coaching company for young actors, especially those hoping to get accepted at highly competitive performing arts colleges.
 Duarte, who grew up acting and performing in the South Coast, knows firsthand about what it takes to get programs that accept only a small amount of students, making them more challenging to get into than the Ivy League in some cases.
 Duarte graduated from Westport High School in 2013 and from there she went to the Boston Conservatory at Berklee College of Music where she obtained her bachelor of fine arts in Musical Theater. "It was a conservatory-style program so I was basically eating, sleeping breathing musical theatre around the clock," she said. "It was my personal dream come true. I was surrounded by people just like me. The class size was super tiny -- it was all individualized training."
 Since then, she's been unofficially advising and mentoring young performing arts hopefuls but now with her new company, ABCoaching, Duarte is set up to help others pursue their acting dreams.
 As a young performer in the SouthCoast, Duarte performed with Little Theatre of Fall River in an array of productions including "Titanic," "Hello Dolly" and "Sound of Music" and with the Star Players of Bristol County. She was also involved with the Westport school system's drama program.
 In college, while her peers had to travel halfway across the country for summer performing opportunities, Duarte managed to land roles with New Bedford Festival Theatre two summers in a row. In 2015 she was in the ensemble in "Mary Poppins" and the following summer she portrayed Sandy Dumbrowski "Grease" both under director Michael Susko in 2016. "It was a great training ground. I was working with people who were super professional and I was able to learn from the best," she said. "It was a perfect segue into my professional life."
 After graduating from Boston Conservatory in 2017, she packed her bags and headed for New York City. Going from growing up in a small town to the Big City was a learning curve, but her experience in Boston laid the groundwork. "I kept my head down and forged by own path," she said of her career that's mostly based in New York City. "I've been hitting the pavement hard just chasing those dreams."
 She left New York for productions of "42nd Street" at the Reagle Theatre in Waltham and the following year at the Palace Theatre in New Hampshire. Her acting career also took a turn she didn't expect with roles in television commercials including a Visa card.
 Three years into living in New York City Duarte said she was feeling like she was exactly where she wanted to be professionally at the start of 2020. Her boyfriend was in a movie and they went out to Los Angeles for the premiere and she was auditioning every day for giant Broadway productions. "I just felt like this was going to be our year and everything crashed down with the pandemic…. My dreams just came to a halt because every day you're waiting for the call. The amazing thing about being an actor is you could be at the bottom of the barrel in your mind and all it takes is one day somebody calls you and says, 'Hey you just got this job'…. Your life can change in an instant."
 For the past three years, Duarte said that's been her mindset: "Keep pushing down; keep training; keep working and something's going to happen. That's sort of been my motivation for as long as I can remember."
 When Broadway was shut down, and it will remain shut until at least 2021, Duarte said she was faced with the question "What do I do now? I'm a performer. That's what I do."
 A self-described "super go-getter" Duarte said she started to think about other things she wanted to do that she just never had the time do or that she hadn't given herself the space to make a priority in her life.
 "The first day of quarantine I sat down at the laptop and I said to my boyfriend, I'm going to start my coaching business," she recalled.
 After giving it some thought, Duarte said she recalled how confused she was coming out of high school with dreams of becoming an actress. "It's the road less traveled. In a lot of small suburban towns it's not a tangible thing. I had the support from my voice teacher and my guidance councilors and my dance teachers and my mentors and peers but nobody that I know had applied for those super-competitive BFA programs. We're talking programs that are sometimes accepting 12 kids."
 Looking at it in the midst of the pandemic, Duarte said she realized she needs to help those kids who now have the added obstacle of the pandemic. Going into a musical theatre program in a college requires the traditional application process along with audition process that has singing, acting and dancing portions. Often there's also a pre-screening video requirement that will determine if a student gets an in-person audition at the college. "It's a lot to handle when the world isn't in a global pandemic and you're about to graduate high school and it's overwhelming because there are so many different components to it," said Duarte.
 Her idea for ABCoaching stemmed from a desire to help those kids to give them the extra boost they need to get into the music theatre program of their dreams. While she said she's open to the idea of younger students, Duarte is gearing her coaching to kids who already have a skill set, love music theater and know what they want to do. "This is for kids who already have that passion and drive and I want to take that and help them cultivate a skill set that will take them to success," she said.
 Though helping kids with the college audition process is one aspect, Duarte said she is also offering private lessons in musical theater or acting.
 For now, Duarte said the coaching will be done virtually via Zoom or Facebook to be safe during the pandemic.

 When hitchhiking, rides just didn't last that long. Picking up a stranger, even back in the old days, took some nerve, so you didn't want them getting too comfortable to change the radio station.
 But if the driver was a guy and the hitcher was a girl that was different. He'd drive her to Romania just to impress her.
 But I'm pretty sure female hitchhikers were urban legends, like Bigfoot or cow tipping. We, on the other hand, were two college guys.
 And that made it twice as hard to get a ride. Picking up one hitchhiker is taking a chance; two hitchers is Russian roulette. So when that first car pulled over after about five minutes on the shoulder, we were thrilled.
 And the more we talked, the longer the ride went. And the longer the ride went the more comfortable we became. And when the guy even bought us lunch that giddiness suddenly turned into suspicion.
 And that suspicion became enhanced when the guy said that not only would he take us all the way to our destination five hours from Marquette, he was willing to go out of his way to do it.
 I was in the back seat wondering what we got ourselves into.
 Sure he looked like a normal, middle-aged guy. But so did Sam Berkowitz. I listened closely for the kidnapped victim to start banging from inside the trunk. But it didn't happen. The driver was just a nice guy and he dropped us off at the Ferris State campus.
 Our 5-hour, 350-mile odyssey took exactly one ride.
 We couldn't believe our luck. Of all the places in all the towns in all the world, he pulled over on our freeway.
 Naturally, our return trip wouldn't be so easy. In fact, it was a good thing we brought our sleeping bags otherwise I'd still be finding pine needles in odd places.
 We visited friends at Ferris for a total of about 18 hours before we hit the road again.
 And, just like when the trip started, it took us no time to get a ride. But unlike that first guy who took us all the way, this person dropped us off after roughly one mile. And that was one of the longer rides.
 It was hours between rides.
 And rides lasted only minutes.
 After a while I would have been grateful to be kidnapped and locked in a trunk. When we finally made over the Mackinac Bridge, it was dark.
 When we finally decided we couldn't take another step, it was the middle of the night along the darkest, loneliest, scariest stretches of Upper Peninsula highways.
 We unfurled our sleeping bags underneath a stand of pine trees and fell sound sleep. For about 15 minutes. Which is how often the 18-wheelers screamed past our heads on the side of the road.
 After two days on the road and dozens of rides, we stumbled back on campus. I never hitchhiked again. Not because I was afraid of getting stuffed into a trunk; I just fear getting squashed by big rigs.

It's expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen, reduced unemployment benefits alongside a fresh round of direct $1,200 cash payments to Americans, and a sweeping five-year liability shield against coronavirus lawsuits.

CAIRO (AP) — The coronavirus has infected people inside several Egyptian prisons and killed at least 14 detainees, as authorities seek to stifle news of the spread of the virus behind bars, a leading human rights watchdog said Monday.
 Human Rights Watch released a report based on letters smuggled from prison and interviews with inmates and their relatives. It documented multiple cases of detainees who died after experiencing suspected virus symptoms without being tested or receiving adequate medical treatment.
 Tens of thousands of people in Egypt are crammed into what rights groups say are overcrowded and unsanitary prisons.

Weird. Manipulative, too. The Administration previously explained it's strange math is due to the fact that it's actively confirming deaths on a rolling basis (e.g. as death certificates are finalized), but until a small handful of reporters started asking the question, there was no affirmative attempt by Murphy or his underlings to explain that the daily "new deaths" number wasn't reflective of exclusively _new deaths_.

The package from McConnell, being crafted behind closed doors, is expected to include $75 billion to help schools reopen. It will likely replace an expiring $600 weekly unemployment benefits boost with a smaller amount. The cut in unemployment assistance is designed to ensure that jobless people do not receive a greater benefit than if they were working. Regular state benefits vary widely and the measure would peg the federal bonus payment to a percentage of the state benefit.

The only thing that can wipe the smile off the face of Melbourne speedster Josh Addo-Carr at the moment is scoring tries.
 While he's had plenty of practice this season, scoring six from nine NRL games, Addo-Carr has twice almost knocked himself out by landing awkwardly while diving over the tryline.
 "The first one I thought the ball was closer to the deadball line than what it was so I was trying to gather it and put it behind me and there was pretty much no time to brace myself," the 24-year-old said on Tuesday.
 "I'm trying not to start a trend ... I've just got to drop the dime a bit lower, I'm diving a bit too high."
 Melbourne appear to be relishing their COVID-19 forced relocation to Queensland's Sunshine Coast, winning four straight, but what's really made Addo-Carr happy is the birth of his son in June.
 Originally to be called Joshua, Addo-Carr and his partner Lakaree decided instead to call him Fox, after his dad's nickname Foxx.
 The trio are all in the Storm camp at Twin Waters with Addo-Carr doing his share of the nappy changes and he was appreciative of the NRL helping keep families together.
 "He's really special - I've always wanted a little boy - and I'm loving every bit of it," he said.
 "It makes it easier to be with family instead of in a hotel by yourself and I'm really grateful for what the NRL and Storm have done for the players."
 Scoring in their past four matches, Addo-Carr is set to leave a big hole when he returns home to Sydney at season's end although he says it's still be finalised.
 "Nothing has happened and my lawyer is stil trying to sort it," the Test winger said.
 "It was taking a toll on me for a bit but I've had to shut it all out so I could play some good footy for my team and I'm a lot better than what I was."
 Melbourne next face struggling Brisbane on Friday night at Suncorp Stadium, which has been a happy hunting ground.
 Addo-Carr said while he felt sympathy for the Broncos they wouldn't be going easy on them.
 "I'm feeling for them but it is a competition and we always have a tough game against them," he said.
 "We love playing at Suncorp and I have no doubt they are going to come out firing and we have to match that from the start."

European Union leaders have agreed on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus-blighted economies at a pre-dawn meeting after a fractious summit that lasted almost five days.
 Summit chairman Charles Michel tweeted "Deal" shortly after the 27 leaders reached agreement at a 5.15am plenary session on Tuesday.
 "This agreement sends a concrete signal that Europe is a force for action," Michel said at a dawn news conference
 "It is about a lot more than money. It is about workers and families, their jobs, their health and their wellbeing. I believe this agreement will be seen as a pivotal moment in Europe's journey, but it will also launch us into the future."
 French President Emmanuel Macron said the deal was truly historic and that he was convinced the recovery plan and budget could meet the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.
 He said concessions had been made to reach a deal.
 Officials said the deal, which came after Michel presented compromises on a 750 billion euro ($A1.22 trillion) recovery fund, is critical to dispel doubts about the bloc's very future.
 News of the deal saw the Euro rise to a fresh four-month high of $US1.1470.
 The European Central Bank has pumped unparalleled money into economies to keep them going, while capitals hammer out their recovery fund.
 Diplomats said the leaders appeared to put aside the rancour that stood in the way of a compromise over hours of haggling through the weekend.
 Emotions had ran high at a dinner on Sunday as a group of fiscally frugal northern nations led by the Netherlands stood their ground on the level of free grants within a proposed special recovery fund of 750 billion euros overall.
 Macron lost patience in the early hours of Monday, banging his fist on the table in frustration at "sterile blockages" by the "frugals", two diplomats said.
 Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also railed against the "frugals", branding them "a group of stingy, egotistic states" that looked at things through the prism of their own interests.
 Poland would be a top beneficiary of the recovery package, receiving tens of billions of euros in grants and cheap loans, along with high-debt Mediterranean-rim countries that have taken the brunt of the pandemic in Europe.
 But the rhetorical skirmishing faded on Monday, and the leaders homed in on an agreement on the stimulus package and, linked to it, the EU's 2021-2027 common budget of around 1.1 trillion euros.
 Michel proposed that within the 750 billion euro recovery fund, 390 billion should be non-repayable grants, down from 500 billion originally proposed, and the rest in repayable loans.
 The Netherlands had pushed for a veto on aid for countries that backslide on economic reform, but diplomats said it was now willing to back a "stop-the- clock" mechanism by which member states could put a brake on disbursements for three months and have them reviewed.
 Disbursements will also be linked to governments observing the rule of law. Hungary, backed by eurosceptic ally Poland, had threatened to veto the package if funds were made conditional on upholding democracy, but diplomats said a way forward on that was found.

Beshear has also asked both Scott circuit judges to disqualify themselves from hearing the agritourism case and having a special judge named, saying they cannot act impartially, because both appear to have personal relationships with Quarles. Social media posts have surfaced showing Quarles and the judges describing each other as good friends, and photos at one another’s campaign events.
 On Monday, Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge Glenn Acree denied a motion by the governor’s attorneys to dissolve the restraining orders, instead combining the two cases into one and assigning it to a three-judge appellate panel.
 This led the Governor’s legal team this week to ask the Kentucky Supreme Court for what is called a writ of mandamus, which would require Appeals Judge Acree to order the circuit courts to dissolve their restraining orders.
 Beshear stated, “The people of Kentucky - and especially the children in now- unsafe daycares, the dedicated caretakers employed in those daycares, and the thousands of Kentuckians who work at agritourism businesses – are at risk every day that the restraining orders remain in effect.”
 Cameron won another battle on Thursday in Boone County, in which the same judge, Richard Brueggemann, denied a motion to quash subpoenas issued to the local health department and unemployment insurance officials, among others. Brueggemann was also expected to nullify many of Beshear’s executive orders.
 But Friday afternoon, in a unanimous ruling, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued a “stay,” which prevents all lower court rulings from taking effect.
