Indeed, much of Chelsea's spending has been funded by high-profile sales, with the proceeds from Real Madrid's £88m ($110m) deal for Eden Hazard being reinvested. The Blues also await payments from Atletico Madrid for former striker Alvaro Morata who was loaned with a view to buy for £58m ($73m).

BANGKOK: Thailand is positioning itself as a trusted destination for international tourists after travel restrictions ease, capitalising on its relative success in containing the coronavirus outbreak, industry officials say.   The Southeast Asian country, the first to report a virus case outside of China, wants to build on its reputation and remake its popular image as a destination for big tour groups.   "After COVID eases, we plan to refresh the country's image to a trusted destination where tourists will have peace of mind," Tanes Petsuwan, the Tourism Authority of Thailand's (TAT) deputy governor for marketing and communications, told Reuters.   The campaign, to be launched later in the year, will be aimed at young affluent travellers from places that are considered low-risk such as China, South Korea and Taiwan, Tanes said. It will highlight scenic beaches and parks, part of a "tourism bridge" that could emerge in Asia including Hong Kong and Japan.   The government has rolled out a health certification system for hotels and restaurants so that travellers can be reassured.   "The certificate is a tool to build trust and showcase Thailand as your amazing trusted destination," Tanes said.   Southeast Asia's second-largest economy has so far reported just over 3,100 cases and 58 deaths – far less than other major regional economies, except for Vietnam. Local transmission has waned, with the last recorded case on May 25.   The tourism industry, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, collapsed after the outbreak escalated. Thailand welcomed 39.8 million foreign tourists last year but projects as few as 14 million for 2020.   Thailand has banned international flights until at least June 30, and foreign tourists aren't expected until later in the year. In the meantime, the government is drawing up a stimulus package to promote domestic tourism from July to October.   But when international travel resumes, Thailand will promote the "trust" concept, as hotels emphasise measures they are taking for safety and offer special packages.   Central Plaza Hotel Pcl, which manages 46 hotels and resorts across Thailand, will seal rooms once they are cleaned and disinfected so guests will be confident, deputy CEO Markland Blaiklock told Reuters.   "We may limit occupancy at 50% on some properties so guests experience social distancing that they are comfortable with," he said.   But it's unclear if travellers will be at ease before a coronavirus vaccine is available, which experts say is at least a year away.   For now, hotels will have to go the extra mile to tempt travellers.   Potjanee Darakamas of Oxford Acuity, which manages and operates hotels, cited private airport transfers, in-room spa services and packages around specific themes such as health retreats and activities tailor-made for individual guests.   "Hygiene is a must, so offering bespoke services will give boutique hotels with unique selling points an advantage over corporate operators."

Unlike medical grade PPE, there are no set regulations for general-wear face masks; they come in all shapes and sizes. But the same guidelines about fit and fabric for adult masks apply to kids’ face masks. As a rule of thumb, masks should be made from at least two layers of breathable, washable, fabric and should fit securely – covering the nose and mouth completely – but without causing discomfort. For children, a sensible precaution to add is that they should be able to take the masks off themselves, just in case they were to ever encounter breathing difficulties, however unlikely that may be.

“It hasn’t been much of a challenge,” Jones said. “I put it on hold. The fans are all pretty good. Not many people wanted refunds because they know I will do a show at some point. I’ve given out refunds to the people who wanted them.”
 The only question at this point is when it will happen. The make-up date was set for Saturday, nearly two and a half months after St. Paddy’s Beatdown’s original date of March 20. That’s no longer the case, as combat sports are still prohibited in Nebraska.
 Jones said he has reached out to the Nebraska Athletic Commission multiple times to try and get permission to continue MMA fights in the state, but hasn’t had any luck.
 “We’re exploring what our options are,” he said. “There is movement. It’s behind the scenes to try and figure out what movement we can make to make this thing work.”
