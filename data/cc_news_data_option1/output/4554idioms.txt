"The one thing you can't do at this level is give them the goals we did.
 Bruce’s assertion that Newcastle did not look after the ball is correct, and while many observers may point to the individual mistakes of Miguel Almiron and Sean Longstaff as the catalysts for this defeat, they would be wrong.
 Even now, 15 months in, it is hard to articulate what a good Newcastle performance looks like. The Magpies plan, their identity, is still nebulous and that fact was even more pronounced when cast alongside the well-drilled and effective style Southampton produced.
 Ralph Hasenhuttl’s pressing system is aggressive, while their direct passing cut through Newcastle’s three-man midfield too often. Bruce has described Newcastle as a ‘work in progress’ and it is fair for fans to be frustrated by that characterisation given he has had more than a year with this group.
 If that is truly the case then there remains a mountain of work to be done for Bruce and his coaching staff. The game represented another 90 minutes in which they summoned very little in terms of attacking intent, with two shots on target registered.
 The misery was compounded by the departure of Callum Wilson with what appeared to be a muscle injury. If that is the case, Bruce will once again need to go back to the drawing board and design a system for this team.

General Sir Arthur Currie, commander of the Canadian Corps, had predicted that the battle would claim 16,000 Canadian casualties.
 They had 15,654 killed or wounded.
 The battle is also significant to New Zealand. On October 12, New Zealand troops were ordered across No Man’s Land and straight into a torrent of German machine gun fire.
 New Zealand, which had a population of just one million, suffered 2,700 casualties, of whom 845 were dead. It was to be the single bloodiest day in the country’s history, and is commemorated there to this day.
 The battle had brought about some success. The British had taken the high ground around Ypres and advanced five miles, but at an awful price - around 320,000 men were killed or wounded.
 Having taken five miles of land, it meant that one man was killed or wounded for every 2.5 centimeters of ground gained.
 The bodies of 42,000 from the battle were never found, lost in the mud.
 The Germans are believed to have lost around 260,000.

The approximately 24,296 nautical miles solo non-stop round-the-world race got underway at 1202 GMT on Sunday with forecasters suggesting that weather conditions will be "beautiful".
 Due to the coronavirus the start will take place without the usual gallery of thousands of spectators lining the harbour walls but Thomson, who came third in 2012 and second four years ago, is still preparing for the goosebumps.
 "You feel like a gladiator when you go down this channel," he said. "I feel sorry for competitors who have never experienced this before," said Thomson whose boat Hugo Boss is one of the pre-race favourites.
 The stress levels have been increased this year in the build-up to the start by the need for all of the skippers to take a late coronavirus test which could see them prevented from starting.
 Isabelle Joschke, one of six women on the start line, said it was like "the sword of Damocles".
 Thomson said he had taken around 20 tests in total.
 "When we were able to sail again after confinement, we adopted a very strict policy regarding our way of operating, not just for me but for the team too," he said.
 "It was hard for the members of the team and their families."
 Fortunately all 33 skippers tested negative and were given the green light on Saturday to start the race.
 Further good news for all of the competitors in a record field is that the race promises to start in glorious conditions.
 "We should leave in beautiful conditions with a south-easterly wind... with 12 to 15 knots of wind more or less south-easterly," race meteorologist Christian Dumard told a press conference.
 "The situation will get a little trickier in the evening since the first competitors will meet a depression which is off the coast of Ireland in the second part of the night."
 Even though this race will not end until late January, there is the same excitement and nerve-jangling for the skippers as at the start of any great sporting challenge.
 "These are very intense moments, the heart rate is up, we have a lot of adrenaline," said French skipper Charlie Dalin.
 "The moment when you go from being surrounded by your team to all alone on board is quite special.
 "When you see them jump into the water one by one, you feel that it becomes more and more what it is all about. Suddenly, it's silence, you can't talk to anyone anymore.
 "You just hear the sound of the sails, the sound of the wind and the countdown of the stopwatch before the start."

"Our suburbs are just becoming more and more Democratic," said former Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello, a Republican and Trump critic. "Some of that is natural. But a big chunk of that is attributable to Donald Trump, who he is, and everything he does that is such a turnoff for suburban voters."
 With nearly all the votes reported in Chester County, Costello's home, Biden was leading Trump by 17 percentage points, 10 better than Clinton's margin.
 Biden had received roughly 150,000 more votes than Clinton did across Chester and Philadelphia's three other neighboring counties -- Bucks, Delaware and Montgomery -- and was winning about 60 percent of the suburban vote, better than Clinton.
 Even in losing Republican-heavy Waukesha County, Wisconsin, Biden's suburban gains were part of his winning Wisconsin formula.
 Biden reached nearly 39 percent in Waukesha County, the state's most populous Republican-heavy county. The last Democrat to carry it was Lyndon Johnson in the landslide of 1964.
 What's more, Trump fell short of a 60 percent in the combined GOP suburban bloc of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington Counties, where even losing Republican Gov. Scott Walker in 2018 reached 65 percent.
 "There's little overstating the significance in the swing in these suburban counties," said veteran Wisconsin Democratic campaign strategist Teresa Vilmain.
 Unlike Clinton, who did not visit Wisconsin during the general election campaign in 2016, Biden visited Wisconsin three times, even as he strictly limited his in-person campaigning in many states during the coronavirus pandemic. Biden traveled to Michigan four times, but campaigned most in Pennsylvania, 14 times.
 While Trump campaigned collectively to all three more often, Biden's campaign vastly outspent Trump's campaign in the three states, $148.7 million to $58.5 million, though other groups spent millions more on either side.
 Biden also tailored his advertising and visits to state-specific dynamics, Michigan's Chapman noted. And while Democratic turnout in Detroit and Milwaukee rebounded from 2016, a boost to Biden, his messages to manufacturing-heavy regions near blue-collar Green Bay, Wisconsin, in September and Erie, Pennsylvania, in October, may have helped him trim Trump's edge in those swing-voting regions, where Clinton lost.
 Trump carried Brown County, home to Green Bay, by a smaller percentage than he did in 2016, and lost Erie County in Pennsylvania, where he had won four years before but where the economy continues to struggle. Trump also lost Saginaw County, Michigan, a struggling former General Motors supply manufacturing county Obama carried before the president flipped.
 "We'd heard so much about the Trump economy. But we're still a manufacturing economy and nearly stagnant in our growth," Erie County Democratic Party Chairman Jim Wertz said. "The Trump economy has not translated into a groundswell of work and opportunity here in Erie County. Joe Biden had the right message for this part Pennsylvania."
 While aggressive Democratic organizing -- the vast majority of it virtual during the pandemic -- was also part of what helped push Biden just over the goal line, the win did not dramatically alter the political landscape in these states.
 There were notably smaller changes.
 Biden captured Sauk County, won by Obama and Trump. The rolling stretch north of Madison is reflective of the state, with Democratic-leaning suburban and exurban growth areas to the south and it's more lightly populated GOP-leaning agricultural north.
 Biden also captured Door County, Wisconsin, where Trump had won after Obama.
 A sign of Democratic growth appeared in Biden's carrying once GOP-heavy Kent County, Michigan, where newcomers in the medical field are diversifying its electorate. The western Michigan county is the home of the late former Republican President Gerald Ford and where Trump's Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos retains a permanent residence.
 The results in Michigan were one area where Democrats could sense a reversal. Trump won the state by 10,704 votes in 2016. Biden's margin over Trump is about 150,000.
 Overall, though, there were hardly the dramatic changes to the maps as in 2016, when Trump carried 21 Wisconsin counties won four years earlier by Obama and 11 in Michigan. Trump flipped only 3 Obama counties in Pennsylvania. Biden turned only four back to Democrats across the three states.
 Likewise, Trump's increased turnout in rural areas, where Democrats were dubious he could recreate the 2016 turnout, caught them by surprise.
 However, with Trump presumably off the ballot, Republican former Pennsylvania Rep. Jim Greenwood sees Pennsylvania sliding back to a Democratic-leaning state, as Trump supporters recede, uninspired by more conventional politicians.
 "I view Trump as a sort of a one-off," said Greenwood, among Republicans who campaigned and raised money for Biden. "Without Trump on the ballot, we're kind of back to a more stable politics."
 But Republicans like Costello, though just as critical of Trump, noted GOP state legislative gains that might prompt Republicans to view Trump's style as the answer--a pitfall when so many suburban voters chose Republican statehouse candidates but Biden for president.
 "I'm concerned that both parties are going to learn the wrong lesson," Costello said, "and that things will get worse before they get better."

But, even as security contacts with Washington continued behind the scenes, the Palestinian leadership felt increasingly isolated, especially after Israel signed agreements with Gulf Arab states to normalise ties.
