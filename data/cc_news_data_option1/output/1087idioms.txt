This Amazon production, which premieres as a stream on March 20, is a nicely constructed, low-budget thriller that features many layers that its writing- directing partners Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy manage to keep on an even, slowly unfolding keel. Not surprisingly, it opens in song, on an ocean pier, with a fisherman, accompanied by three other fishermen, belting out the title song.      But why they're singing it, and why the film takes its name from it, is and will remain a bigger mystery than the multiple mysteries that move the film along.      The location is the fictional Easter Cove, Maine, where two women, Pris (Sophie Lowe) and her younger sister Mary Beth (Morgan Saylor) - they're known in town as the Connolly girls - are sharing a drink before attending the funeral of their mother.      Though this appears to be the beginnings of a character study on the differences between the siblings - they're close, but Pris is the responsible one, Mary Beth is the wild child - it soon heads off into all sorts of directions, with many other people.      Post-funeral, Mary Beth heads for the local bar for a few drinks, but has some trouble with local bad apple Gorski (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who comes on to her, won't let up and - since this happens so early in the film, I'll give it away - is killed by her in self-defense, with a harpoon assist.      Uh-oh, this is not the kind of thing you want to be caught up in in a small town. Good thing steady-nerved Pris is around to figure out what to do, to put a plan in motion to get rid of the body. But this proves to be no easy feat, and in one of the film's best darkly humorous lines of dialogue, as they're trying to stuff him in a cooler, a shaken Mary Beth says, "What are we supposed to do, Pris? Chop his arms off?"      Well, yeah! And that very sharp knife with the Connolly fishing business name emblazoned on it should do the trick. And the endless ocean would be a great place to dump the cooler.      Time to meet more people. There's Enid (Margo Martindale), who runs the Ocean View B&B; (which really should be called a B&B;&B; because it's also a brothel). And there's a trio of longtime residents - Susie, Gail, and Doreen (June Squibb, Annette O'Toole, Marceline Hugot) who seem to know everything about everyone. And there are a couple of cops - one is a regular customer at the B&B;&B;, the other is an inquisitive man just doing his job.      Before you can catch a breath, a body washes up onshore, and when the sisters find out, they panic. But it turns out to be a bullet-riddled woman (no harpoon marks!) who worked at the B&B;&B;, and she wasn't exactly preparing breakfasts or making beds. Look out! Nasty, foul-mouthed working woman Lexie (Gayle Rankin) is soon making things even murkier.      By the time the expanding series of plotlines introduces a bag with $50,000 cash, and the Connolly knife has gone missing, you're wondering where else this story can possibly turn. Some sleepy little town!      The film is about all of these people and incidents, but the focus eventually comes around to Enid, and Martindale gives a frightening, multi-textured performance as a powerful woman who's juggling a lot of secrets.      There are questions everywhere you turn, and just about all of them are answered. But the writers-directors couldn't quite lick the problem of how to end it, and in an attempt to wrap things up, those answers are delivered too quickly, too neatly. And I'm still wondering why the film is called "Blow the Man Down."      "Blow the Man Down" premieres on Amazon on March 20.      Ed Symkus writes about movies for More Content Now. He can be reached at esymkus@rcn.com.      "Blow the Man Down"   Written and directed by Bridget Savage Cole and Danielle Krudy   With Sophie Lowe, Morgan Saylor, Margo Martindale, Gayle Rankin   Rated R

E' in Italia dal 2015. Due anni a Roma, poi il trasferimento a Torino. In tutto neanche un quinquennio, ma comunque un lasso di tempo sufficiente a Wojciech Tomasz Szczesny, portiere polacco classe 1990, per innamorarsi dell'Italia. Bello e profondo il post che l'estremo difensore della Juventus ha dedicato a un'Italia che lotta in prima linea contro la pandemia del coronavirus. Ad accompagnare le sue parole le immagini delle meraviglie del "Bel Paese". "Mentre continuiamo a preoccuparci delle nostre famiglie e dei nostri cari, pregando che non vengano colpiti dal virus, ci chiediamo come e perché tutto ciò è accaduto. Domande a cui potremmo non trovare mai risposte. Ci chiediamo quale sarà il futuro - scrive Szczesny -, che riflessi avrà tutto questo sulla nostra società e se le cose torneranno alla normalità". Riflessioni che Szczesny ha fatto e che lo hanno portato a fare una dichiarazione d'amore per l'Italia, cercando nello stesso tempo di trasmettere a tutti coraggio e determinazione nella lotta al "nemico invisibile".

However, some countries impose duty on goods brought into the country, though they had been bought duty-free in another country, or when the value or quantity of such goods exceed an allowed limit. Duty-free shops are often found in the international zone of international airports, sea ports, and train stations but goods can also be bought duty-free on board airplanes and passenger ships. They are not as commonly available for road or train travelers, although several border crossings between the United States and both Canada and Mexico have duty-free shops for car travelers. In some countries, any shop can participate in a reimbursement system, such as Global Blue and Premier Tax Free, wherein a sum equivalent to the tax is paid, but then the goods are presented to customs and the sum reimbursed on exit.

 WASHINGTON In a massive federal effort, President Donald Trump asked Congress to speed emergency checks to Americans, enlisted the military for MASH-like hospitals and implored ordinary people -- particularly socially active millennials -- to do their part by staying home to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
   
 His proposed economic package alone could approach $1 trillion, a rescue initiative not seen since the Great Recession. Trump wants checks sent to the public within two weeks and is urging Congress to pass the eye-popping stimulus package in a matter of days.
   
 As analysts warn the country is surely entering a recession, the government is grappling with an enormous political undertaking with echoes of the 2008 financial crisis.
   
 At the Capitol on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed the Senate would not adjourn until the work was done.
   
 "Obviously, we need to act," McConnell said. "We're not leaving town until we have constructed and passed another bill."
   
 But first, McConnell said, the Senate will vote on a House-passed package of sick pay, emergency food and free testing, putting it back on track for Trump's signature -- despite Republican objections. "Gag, and vote for it anyway," he advised colleagues.
   
 It was a signal of what the GOP leader called the "herculean" task ahead.
   
 Senators gathered at an otherwise shut-down Capitol as Americans across the country were implored to heed advice and avoid crowds. Young adults, in particular, are being urged to quit going out because even seemingly healthy people can be spreading the virus that causes the COVID-19 illness.
   
 Even so, presidential primary elections unfolded in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Ohio's was called off hours before the polls were set to open.
   
 After a savage drop at the start of the week, the stock market rose as Trump and aides sketched out elements of the economic rescue package at a briefing. Economists doubted that would be enough to stop millions of jobs losses, even if in the short term.
   
 Bigger than the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout or the nearly $800 billion 2009 recovery act, the White House proposal aims to provide a massive tax cut for wage-earners, $50 billion for the airline industry and $250 billion for small businesses. Two people familiar with he package described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.
   
 The amount that would be sent out in checks Americans is not yet disclosed. The White House said it liked GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's idea for $1,000 checks, though not necessarily at that sum and not for wealthier people.
   
 "This is a very unique situation," said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, exiting a private briefing of Senate Republicans. "We've put a proposal on that table that would attract a trillion dollars into the economy."
   
 One GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, told reporters afterward it "could be" up to $1 trillion.
   
 Senate Democrats produced their own $750 billion proposal, which includes $400 billion to shore up hospitals and other emergency operations in response to the global pandemic and $350 billion to bolster the safety net with unemployment checks and other aid to Americans.
   
 "The aid has to be workers first," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, not what happened in 2008, when the big banks took precedence. Schumer also said it's time to call out the National Guard to provide security as communities reel from the crisis.
   
 The slow-moving Congress is being asked to approve the far-reaching economic rescue as it tries to rise to the occasion of these fast times.
   
 A roster of America's big and small industries -- airlines, hotels, retailers and even casinos -- lined up for hoped-for aid.
   
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
   
 The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
   
 Still, health officials are urging Americans to stay home to prevent an onslaught of cases that could overwhelm hospitals as happened in Italy, among the countries hardest hit.
   
 As Congress considered aid, the Pentagon on Tuesday said it would provide 5 million respirator masks and 2,000 specialized ventilators to federal health authorities. And Medicare was immediately expanding coverage for telemedicine nationwide to help seniors with health problems stay home to avoid infection.
   
 More than two dozen Senate Democrats urged Trump to invoke the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to increase production of masks, ventilators and respirators, as well as expand hospital capacity to combat the coronavirus. Federal officials said the administration is working with the Army Corps of Engineers to see about erecting temporary hospitals, as is done in the military, to handle an expected surge of cases.
   
 Schumer compared the government response needed to a wartime mobilization.
   
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who marshaled the earlier package through a bipartisan vote last week, fielded a call from Mnuchin on Tuesday morning and another from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the afternoon, encouraged by the Fed chairman's perspective that Congress could think big with interest rates at nearly zero.
   
 In the call with Mnuchin, she and Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., chairman of the House Transportation committee, "emphasized that protecting workers' paychecks and benefits was their top priority, and that immediate action was needed," said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill on Twitter.
   
 The debate is sure to revive the sharp divisions over the costly bank bailout and economic recovery of the Obama and Bush eras.
   
 Much about the proposed checks is not known, such as whether the amount would vary by the income of the recipient or whether everyone would get the same sum. Mnuchin said "it's clear we don't need to send people who make $1 million a year checks, OK?"
   
 Economists from both parties endorsed mailing checks of at least $1,000 to all American households as the quickest way to offset the sharp slowdown in economic activity.
   
 "We need to pay people to stay at home," said Heidi Shierholz, a senior policy analyst at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think-tank. The group predicted that without a huge stimulus package, the U.S. economy could lose three million jobs by this summer.
   
 Still, some GOP senators were skeptical about the massive aid on the table. "I'm going to be very leery of doing something like in 2008," said Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun.
   
 "Right now, the plan around here is basically to just to start shoveling money out of a helicopter," said Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb. "This is a bad idea. … We don't need a policy where Washington, D.C., handpicks winners and losers."
   
 Despite federal guidelines against so many people gathering, senators had no choice but to convene. Legislating cannot be done from home.
   
 But late Tuesday, another lawmaker, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., announced he would self-quarantine after contact with a constituent who later tested positive for coronavirus.

DCC released a statement on March 16 saying the food pantry will be extending its hours and offering drive-up service until further notice.
 “In light of the Coronavirus and its potential impact on local families we are increasing the times the DCC Food Pantry is open to help families in need,” the statement said.
 To request items, people should call the food pantry the day before orders are going to be picked up. Pick up times will be set over the phone, at (608) 764-5935 extension 2 or 4.
 Clients should call on Tuesdays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. for a Wednesday pick-up time, and on Fridays from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. for a Saturday pick-up time.
 Pick-up times are typically every Wednesday from 12-2:30 p.m., the second Saturday of the month from 9-11 a.m., and the fourth Thursday of every month from 6-7 p.m.
 Volunteers will pre-pack and bring out orders to the back side of the building.
 “It’s a really challenging time for everyone,” said Julie Schwenn, the coordinator for the pantry.
 Deerfield is also expecting more food pantry traffic, because of school closures and possible work hours changing.
 “We know it’s important to families,” Schwenn said. “We think it’s an important resource for them.”
 Both food pantries are accepting donations and community help at this point, and both Rumpf and Schwenn say community members are reaching out to help.

The Kentucky Derby was postponed until September on Tuesday, the latest rite of spring in sports to be struck by the new coronavirus along with the Masters, March Madness and baseball season.
 The Derby, America's longest continuously held sports event, had been scheduled for May 2. It will now be run Sept. 5, kicking off Labor Day weekend.
 "We'll roll with the punches, and feel very, very good that September is the right date," Bill Carstanjen, CEO of Churchill Downs Inc., said on a conference call.
 It's the first time the Derby won't be held on its traditional first Saturday in May since 1945, when it was run June 9. The federal government suspended horse racing nationwide for most of the first half of the year before World War II ended in early May, but not in time to hold the first leg of the Triple Crown that month.
 The date change still must be approved by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission at its meeting Thursday. Still to be decided are the dates of the next two legs of horse racing's showcase series -- the Preakness and Belmont.
 Carstanjen said the September date was chosen after talks with NBC Sports, which televises the Triple Crown races, based on the limited number of sports events that weekend and hotel availability in Louisville.
 Churchill Downs clearly wasn't interested in running the 146th Derby without fans in the stands, which is what other tracks have been doing, including Santa Anita in California, Oaklawn in Arkansas and the Fair Grounds in Louisiana.
 "We feel confident we are going to run the Kentucky Derby and run it with a crowd," Carstanjen said. "It's a participatory event."
 The race itself lasts just two minutes, but the partying and socializing goes on throughout Derby week, with celebrity-stuffed charity galas and private house parties. Last year's race drew 150,729 fans.
 The tradition of sipping mint juleps, donning fancy hats and dress clothes, and the crowd singalong to "My Old Kentucky Home" as the horses step onto the track has always made the Derby more than just a sports event. People who pay little attention to horse racing the rest of the year typically watch the Derby and wager on it either formally or in pools set up at parties.
 The Derby was first run in 1875 and has gone uninterrupted, even through the Great Depression and World Wars I and II.
 In 1943, there were travel restrictions imposed by World War II and no out-of- town tickets were sold. Still, the Derby went on, with Count Fleet winning in front of 65,000. The colt won the Triple Crown that year.
 The Kentucky Oaks, the race for filles held on Derby eve, is also hugely popular, especially among Louisville locals. It first began in 1875. It will be run Sept. 4.
 Horses have been training and racing to earn points that translate into berths in the 20-horse Derby field even as the rest of the sports world has mostly shut down because of the virus pandemic. Horses have only one chance in their lives to compete in the Derby, Preakness and Belmont stakes, which comprise the Triple Crown for 3-year-olds.
 Carstanjen said points already earned by horses would be maintained, while existing races at tracks across the country would be added to the Road to the Kentucky Derby qualifying process.
 "This will be fun and give fans more time to learn about this year's crop of 3-year-olds," he said.
 The Derby, the first leg of the Triple Crown, draws strong TV ratings. By moving it to Sept. 5, the race wouldn't conflict with Notre Dame football, satisfying NBC Sports, which televises both. The University of Louisville has an away football game that day.
 The Preakness is scheduled for May 16 at Pimlico in Baltimore, and the Maryland Jockey Club said no decision has yet been made on the second leg of the Triple Crown.
 The Belmont is set for June 6 in New York. The New York Racing Association said "decisions about large-scale public events must prioritize public health and safety above all else." NYRA added that it will update the status of the Belmont "only when that process has concluded to the satisfaction of state and local health departments."
 For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, with the vast majority recovering in about two weeks.
 Carstanjen said Churchill Downs alerted Pimlico and Belmont Park as it got close to completing a new date with NBC Sports.
 "They were receptive and had their own questions. There is time in the calendar that NBC can make available," he said. "They just have to work it out together and I hope they do."
 NBC Sports said in a statement it appreciates the "traditional sequencing of the Triple Crown races," but these are "uncharted waters" and the network will work with the Preakness and Belmont to "determine the most appropriate timing."
 Businesses in the Louisville area, including hotels, restaurants, gas stations, grocery and liquor stores, depend on the Derby to earn a large portion of their revenue for the year. Almost all such entities raise their prices significantly during the Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Derby week.
 The Derby has an estimated economic impact of $400 million on the Louisville area.
 The Kentucky Derby Festival had already postponed some of its early events until April 5. The two weeks of events leading up to the Derby, highlighted by the Thunder Over Louisville fireworks show, have a local economic impact of $127 million.
 The NBA and NHL have suspended their seasons indefinitely. Major League Baseball has postponed the start of its season until mid-May at the earliest, and one of the biggest events to be called off was the NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness that captivates the country for three weeks. Another spring fixture postponed until September was the Boston Marathon. Colleges have canceled spring sports.

Andrew Berry's first moment of truth as roster boss of the Browns arrives in the form of free agency.
   
 Berry finds himself beholden to two big questions. One, who is willing to play in Cleveland? Two, who among the willing is worth asking?
   
 Beginning with Phil Savage, the men in charge of luring free agents to Cleveland have had a rough time finding decent answers.
   
 This point can be illustrated be presenting one view of the top 13 Browns free agency pick-ups since Savage was hired away from the Ravens as general manager in 2005. Some good players have been brought in, but the list of those who were on top of their games for as many as three seasons is very short indeed.
   
 1, Guard Eric Steinbach, signed in 2007 (Savage). He was an effective left guard through most of his 62 starts from 2007-10, but a back injury ended his career when he was 30.
   
 2, Center JC Tretter, signed in 2017 (Sashi Brown). He is an iron man and a leader who has started all 48 games, coming off four years and 10 total starts for Green Bay.
   
 3, Guard Kevin Zeitler, signed in 2017 (Brown). His five-year, $60 million contract turned heads. He started all 32 games in his two Cleveland seasons before getting traded to the Giants.
   
 4, Defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson, signed in 2019 (John Dorsey). His 775 snaps were second among Browns defensive linemen to Larry Ogunjobi's 779. A D-line surge might have continued without the Myles Garrett suspension. Richardson's three-year, $37 million contract gives Berry the option of keeping Richardson through 2021, when he will be 31.
   
 5, Linebacker Willie McGinest, signed in 2006 (Savage). He was 34 in his first season with the Browns, but he had been a force in New England. Though in decline, he added fiber that helps explain how the 2007 team went 10-6. He was a competent starter for three years.
   
 6, Running back Jamal Lewis, signed in 2007 (Savage). His 1,304 rushing yards were a big part of the 10-6 team, but it was a last dance followed by two seasons of decline.
   
 7, Tight end Ben Watson, signed in 2010 (Tom Heckert). He led the Browns in catches and receiving yards in 2010, but after Eric Mangini got fired his two years under Pat Shurmur weren't as good.
   
 8, Linebacker Karlos Dansby, signed in 2014 (Ray Farmer). He was the best player on the front seven for a defense that helped the '14 team to a 7-4 start. He started all 32 games across two seasons, but he was cut at age 34.
   
 9, Edge rusher Paul Kruger, signed in 2013 (Joe Banner/Mike Lombardi). He produced 11 sacks in 2014, but he was expensive, and he got cut by the new Sashi Brown regime during the 2016 preseason.
   
 10, Receiver Joe Jurevicius, signed in 2006 (Savage). The savvy vet's 2007 season was full of catches influencing the 10 wins, but a staph infection wiped out his 2008 season, and he never played again.
   
 11, Safety Donte Whitner, signed in 2014 (Farmer). Mike Pettine loved how his leadership played into a 7-4 start in '14, but his play and the team faded, and he was gone by 2016.
   
 12, Tight end Gary Barnidge, signed in 2013 (Banner/Lombardi). In 2015, he caught 79 passes for 1,043 yards and looked like a Hall of Famer in a win at Baltimore. His other three Browns seasons were nothing like that.
   
 13, Floyd "Pork Chop" Womack, signed in 2009 (Eric Mangini). He was a decent utility lineman in the final two years of his career, and his inclusion reflects the quality of free agents the team has been able to land.
   
 Savage's name shows up several times. His chance for sustained success got hurt by mistakes, bad luck and not finding a quarterback.
   
 Of all of the players in this article, offensive lineman LeCharles Bentley was the best combination of youth and talent when Savage signed him in 2006. Bentley suffered a career-ending injury on his first day of training camp. Savage overpaid offensive lineman Kevin Shaffer in 2006 and wound up getting problems instead of production from wideout Donte Stallworth, a 2008 pick-up.
   
 On an encouraging note, Berry was an important part of the regime headed by Sashi Brown when Tretter and Zeitler were signed. Brown had final say over roster decisions then. Now, it's Berry, who seems jazzed by the newfound power.
   
 A few times, starting with Savage, a Browns personnel boss has stepped on the gas, only to get jerked into reverse.
   
 Most recently it was Dorsey, whose 2018 roster went on a late 5-1 hot streak. This obscured the fact he had not done well in 2018 free agency. Richardson became his only helpful free agent in an ill-fated 2019.
   
 Tight end Demetrius Harris, guard Eric Kush and linebacker Adarius Taylor all were signed in by Dorsey 2019 and cut by Berry recently.
   
 Harris made five catches for 52 yards in the six 2019 wins. Kush was benched with the team at 2-5 in his seven starts at right guard. Taylor was busy on special teams but was hardly used as a situational linebacker (60 snaps).
   
 Dorsey's 2018 free agents included cornerback T.J. Carrie (released in February), defensive lineman Chris Smith (waived in December), quarterback Drew Stanton (contract ran out after he spent 2019 on injured reserve), tight end Darren Fells (cut after the 2018 season), running back Carlos Hyde (traded after six games) and defensive back E.J. Gaines (played four games in his only year as a Brown).
   
 Dorsey's 2018 free agents who remain on the team are right tackle Chris Hubbard, whose five-year, $36.5 million contract was based on what appears to have been a misguided projection, and defensive back Terrance Mitchell, who was entrusted to 22 defensive snaps across his final nine games in 2019, when he played sparingly on special teams.
   
 The story of Dorsey's demise is long and complicated. Free agency certainly is one of the chapters.
   
 The fair thing seems to give Berry a chance. Here, two questions rather than 20 seem to cover his potential moves.
   
 What might he do? What CAN he do?
   
 In persuading tight end Austin Hooper, tackle Jack Conklin and quarterback Case Keenum to become Browns as 2020 free agents, he is off to a good start.

You can choose base layers with short or long sleeves, or sleeveless. Sleeveless and short sleeves are best suited for warmer days and the summer, but depending on the layers you’re putting over the top, and how cold it actually is, a short sleeve base layer can still be useful in the winter. Sometimes it’s simply not cold enough for a long sleeve base layer, and you can always add arm warmers if going with short sleeves.

Mantachie officials are accepting sealed bids to clear nearly three acres of land for potential business growth in the heart of town.
 The 2.8-acre lot on Hodges Drive was put up for sale in Nov. 2017 after its longtime owner, O.R. Dulaney, died. The Town of Mantachie paid a final price of $76,001 for the property the following December. Since then, town officials have been contemplating what, exactly, to do with the land.
 “We’ve been in discussions about the possibilities of subdividing the property,” Mayor Matt Fennell said. “We’re still having conversations.”
 The property is zoned commercial, and Fennell said several businesses have expressed interest in purchasing the lots if town officials decide to divide the property into smaller parcels. The land currently holds two houses and a handful of smaller buildings that will be torn down.
 “We’re trying to take steps to develop the property right now,” Fennell told The Times. “We hope to have something in the works later this year.”
 He said Mantachie leaders feel that the Dulaney property has the potential to be a very marketable piece of commercial property that could attract a variety of businesses.
 Fennell previously touted the solid foundation built by Mantachie’s many homegrown businesses. The mayor said other municipalities in the area are making efforts to ensure a strong financial future with real estate purchases somewhat similar to the Town of Mantachie’s.
 “I applaud our Board of Aldermen for being progressive thinkers,” Fennell said. “Our officials want nothing but the best for our citizens and community. We look forward to seeing the future of Mantachie take shape.”

Separately, Trump will talk to airline CEOs, the second time this month he has talked to an industry that has seen its traffic grind to a halt as people stay home. The industry says the pandemic has had a more deleterious effect on business than the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and has sought a government bailout.
 "We don't want airlines going out of business. We don't want people losing their jobs," Trump said at a press conference on Tuesday. "We're going big."
 Trump also was set to join a conference call with the Business Roundtable, CEOs from the country's largest companies.
 Meanwhile, the Trump administration is asking Congress for $45.8 billion in emergency money that includes resources for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, funding for states' public health needs, and research resources at the National Institutes of Health. The request comes as the Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a separate House-approved package that provides economic relief to those affected and resources for testing.
 The White House is also pitching Congress on an economic rescue package worth about $1 trillion. That's 45 percent more than federal defense spending in 2019, and would eclipse the former Obama administration's 2009 stimulus package of $787 billion.

Chelsea's Millennium Hotel at Stamford Bridge will be made available to National Health Service (NHS) workers for free during the coronavirus pandemic.
 Medical personnel initially from hospitals in north-west London will be able to use the hotel for the next two months, though that period could be extended.
 The Blues said the initiative was led by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, who will cover the cost of the accommodation.
 A club statement read: "Chelsea Football Club is joining the medical response to the coronavirus outbreak in London with the news the National Health Service (NHS) has accepted the club's offer to make the Millennium Hotel at Stamford Bridge available for NHS staff.
 "The initiative came from club owner Roman Abramovich and, after contact with the NHS was made by Chairman Bruce Buck, it was decided the best way Chelsea can assist the NHS is to provide accommodation for NHS staff. Mr Abramovich will be covering the costs of providing the accommodation.
 "Many of the medical staff will be working long shifts and may not be able to travel home or would otherwise have to make long commutes. Local accommodation helps maintain the health and well-being of these crucial personnel at this critical time.
 "This will be for a two-month period, and then reconsidered in light of circumstances at the time. NHS staff will be those working in hospitals in the north-west London region, but that may extend to hospitals in other districts.
 "The number of rooms utilised will depend on demand but potentially all the rooms in the Millennium Hotel could be given over for this purpose. No staff showing symptoms will use the hotel."
 Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for COVID-19 last week and the Premier League was subsequently suspended until at least April 3.
 According to the World Health Organization, there have been 1,954 confirmed cases in the United Kingdom and 55 deaths as of Wednesday.

NEW YORK (AP) — Coronavirus has become a “get out of jail” card for hundreds of low-level inmates across the country. And even hard- timers are seeking their freedom with the argument that it’s not a matter of if but when the deadly illness sweeps through tightly packed populations behind bars. Among those making pleas for compassionate release or home detention are 81-year-old drug kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, Ponzi swindler Bernard Madoff, President Donald Trump’s former attorney Michael Cohen and dozens of inmates at New York City’s Rikers Island, part of a jail system that lost a worker to the virus this week.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

Nathanson said that if the rest of the NBA season is canceled, ESPN will lose out on as much as $475 million in advertising revenues. There could also be an additional $150 million decline in ad revenues related to all of the other sports that were shut down through the end of March, including the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament in Indian Wells, Calif.
 Nathanson expects Disney to save hundreds of millions of dollars by not having to pay as much in sports rights, although there will be an investment of as much as $100 million required to program the hours that would ordinarily be devoted to live coverage. “We do think this will be done as efficiently as possible including reusing previously telecast games and specials,” he said.
 Todd Juenger, media analyst with Bernstein & Co, has an even rosier view about the cost savings realized from not incurring the cost of live sports programming.
 “The shutdown of all organized sporting events is obviously a bad thing for the ESPN family of networks, the SEC network, and newly launched ACC network, as well as ABC broadcast,” Juenger said. “Surprisingly, we believe the near- term impact on segment profits will be more-or-less profit. It could even be profit positive.”
 But there is no guarantee that TV rights fees that ESPN has already paid sports leagues will be immediately rebated to ESPN or other networks that carry sports.
 Lee Berke, a sports media consultant, said the leagues can also make up for lost games by extending deals, adding programming or granting networks permission to run more commercials.
 “What nobody wants to do unless it’s absolutely necessary is give money back,” Berke said. “Most likely there will be tougher discussions down the road. It’s a very rare event, and you’re going to have to deal with it in a variety of ways to make people whole.”
 There is also a question of whether cord-cutting will accelerate as ESPN rides out the sports shutdown.

ESPN is also developing programming that doesn’t require a full production staff to come to its headquarters and studios in Bristol, Conn., as most of them are working at home to avoid the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
 Viewers are being asked to vote online to determine the greatest college basketball player of all time — in a bracket style similar to those used in the canceled NCAA College Basketball tournaments — with the results presented in a special airing Thursday.
 While ESPN and other TV networks try to fill the gap  created by the public health crisis, financial analysts who follow Disney are watching for any long- term impact on a business that has been weathering the challenges of shifting viewer habits.
 ESPN’s lack of live games is projected to lead to a ratings decline of as much as 80% and compound the problems for Disney, which has been reeling on multiple fronts due to the pandemic. Disney’s theme parks are closed around the world, and its cruise ships are stuck in harbors. Movie theater closures have erased another big source of revenue for the company because Walt Disney Studios relies heavily on its box office blockbusters.
 Analysts worry that a recession could prevent a return to business as usual, as leisure spending is discretionary and households will have less income for such extras. The challenges come at a time when Disney has more than doubled its corporate debt to $47 billion to pay for its acquisition of much of 21st Century Fox. They also follow a recent changing of the guard as longtime Chief Executive Bob Iger handed the day-to-day operations over to Bob Chapek, who had run Disney’s parks and attractions.
 A decade ago, ESPN was distributed in about 100 million homes, but now ESPN and ESPN2 are found in about 84 million pay-TV homes. The reduction means the company is taking in less money in fees received from pay TV distributors — known in the industry as affiliate fees — while programming costs continue to rise.
 ESPN has countered the trend with the launch of its over-the-top streaming service ESPN+ — which is an eventual replacement for the traditional pay TV subscription — and the inclusion of its channels on internet-delivered TV services such as Sling and Hulu Plus. Jimmy Pitaro, who took over the reins of ESPN in 2018, has made the network’s availability on digital platforms a priority.
 But the virus has delivered an unexpected curveball. Media analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a research note Tuesday that Disney’s media networks, including ESPN, will likely take in $250 million less in revenue in fiscal year 2020 than anticipated due to the sports cancellations.

Interviewed later in the week, Hill gave a similarly vague statement, saying that Smith was “lacking in the leadership department.”
 Hill pointed out that the board was still in negotiations to settle with Smith and that he hadn’t been fired yet. That means the school system currently has two superintendents simultaneously — interim superintendent and longtime ACS administrator Joe Cronk, and lame duck Superintendent Tim Smith.
 Smith was — still is, until the agreement is finalized — making $145,000 a year plus benefits. He’s apt to get a generous severance package, leaving taxpayers to foot that bill, plus the salary of his to-be-determined successor.
 The school board owes Anderson residents, many of whom send their children to schools in the ACS system, a better, more-detailed explanation of why Smith was let go. From most perspectives, he was a steady leader in tempestuous times for public schools.
 Presumably, the school board feels the next superintendent will do better. Of course, that’s difficult to judge, since the public has no idea what Smith did wrong.

Latest reports are claiming that Arsenal have named our price to Barcelona for the signature of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, with £50 Million supposedly the figure being demanded.
 The Gabonese international is claimed to have said he will not be signing a new contract with the club, and with only 12 months remaining on his current deal come this summer, his sale looks almost forced on our part.
 We could decide to force the player to stay at the club at risk of losing him for free in 12 months time, or to try and sell him for a lower fee come January. Either way the financial implications could be huge, and although he would be tough to replace, it could help us out in the long run.
 The 30 year-old has scored 17 of our 40 Premier League goals this term, although his portion of the goals was higher before Arteta took over as coach, and he clearly is bringing more out of the players around him.
 The £50 Million fee would likely not be enough to bring in a proven world class goalscorer any more, with the likes of Alvaro Morata, Romelu Lukaku and Kylian Mbappe going for over 50% higher than that fee, but there is always a chance of landing an Erling Haaland, who just moved to Dortmund for £20 Million and is absolutely on fire.
 His acquisition was a slight risk, as the Austrian is hardly up in lights, but his Champions League exploits was enough for the BVB to pull the trigger, and what a bargain he is proving to be.
 Assuming the current Premier League season is allowed to continue, Aubameyang will be key in our bid to climb into the European slots, with hope of a top five finish all that is needed this term to gain Champions League football.
 Losing Aubameyang may hamper our bid to return to the elite European competition temporarily, but using that money to close the gap could be a part of the bigger picture.
 If Aubameyang is definitely not signing another deal, would you take £50 Million or keep him for 12 more months?
