Of the 103 judges on the ballot across the Colorado, voters decided against retaining only one, and returned to office the other judge who received an unfavorable job review.
 Unofficial results showed District Court Judge Tomee Crespin losing her seat as of 9:35 p.m., with 55% of voters in the 17th Judicial District casting ballots against her retention. Crespin was one of two judges to receive a recommendation of "does not meet performance standards" from the citizen-led commissions that evaluate judges' performance.
 Crespin, a 2016 appointee of Gov. John Hickenlooper, handles criminal cases in Adams and Broomfield counties. Her performance commission found her demeanor to be lacking, writing that she "did not treat those appearing before her with respect."

As if 2020 could get any drearier, many Bay State residents saw snowflakes flying Friday before the calendar even turned to November and Gov. Charlie Baker made his best attempt this week to call off Thanksgiving.
 But for many legal enthusiasts and practitioners, there was a Budd of light.
 Baker nominated Kimberly Budd to become the 38th and next chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Court. If confirmed, Budd, an associate justice on the SJC, would be the first Black woman to lead the 328-year-old court, and the second woman and second Black justice to hold the title.
 Former Gov. Deval Patrick and one-time Baker political foe Deval Patrick called it an "inspired choice." It was Patrick, after all, who first made Budd a judge in 2009, and he was not alone in praising the pick.
 Budd first joined the SJC in 2016 when Baker included her in his first round of three picks for the top court, but she called this occasion a "bittersweet" one, knowing that her moment in the sun only came around because of the unexpected death of the late Chief Justice Ralph Gants last month.
 With the weight of history and a pandemic thrust onto her shoulders, the Harvard Law School graduate and daughter of former U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said it was both "overwhelming" and "very meaningful" to be in such a position.
 "We're in the middle of a pandemic," Budd said during her introductory press conference. "People in the commonwealth are in a panic. People are hurting, and we have to make sure that the judiciary is running as well as it can, and that's what I'm focused on now."
 The Governor's Council, which had its own brush with COVID this week that forced it to meet remotely, plans a Nov. 12 confirmation hearing. Baker said he hopes to put two more nominees before the council soon to round out the seven-member court, at which point all seven justices will have been nominated by Baker.
 Budd, at 54, would also be the youngest chief justice in more than a century, but her age would put her outside of the problematic "under 30 crowd" that Baker identified this week as the source of the greatest COVID-19 spread, a change from the early days of the pandemic when those over 60 drove most cases.
 With the days of 1,000 or more new daily cases mounting - 1,488 more on Friday - Baker last week issued a warning about Thanksgiving: "The science on this one's pretty clear - gathering in groups indoors for an extended period of time with family and friends is likely the worst possible scenario for spreading the virus."
 The state is urging people to rethink Thanksgiving gatherings, asking families to limit dinners and football watching to people within a household, and if outside friends and family are invited, to wear masks and avoid buffet-style dining.
 And no picking at the turkey carcass, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders cautioned.
 Baker announced new protocols Monday.
 With Thanksgiving just a few weeks away and the Legislature nowhere near close to sending Gov. Baker a fiscal year 2021 budget, the House and Senate made quick work this week of another interim budget to keep the government open beyond this weekend.
 The $5.4 billion spending authorization bill is the third interim budget to be approved for the fiscal year that began July 1, and Baker said it should be enough money to get through November.
 The Legislature still hasn't met in a formal session since the end of July, but it also managed to pass a bill signed by Baker to make an estimated 17,000 workers newly eligible for up to $1,800 in enhanced federal unemployment benefits that they did not initially qualify for because their standard benefits were too little.
 By increasing the minimum weekly benefit to $100 for the week ending July 31 through the week ending Sept. 5, the Legislature allowed thousands of workers who were unemployed during that six-week period to access up to $31 million in total federal support.
 The activity in the Legislature was some of the most substantive since its last formal session in July, and the pace will likely pick up after the conclusion of the election next Tuesday when lawmakers will enter lame duck waters uncharted since the 1990s.
 The pressure is mounting from supporters of an abortion access bill known as the ROE Act to move quickly in light of Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation to the Supreme Court, and advocates of all stripes and colors are likely to come out of the woodwork post-election to see if they can resuscitate whatever issue stalled during the normal lawmaking season.
 Education Secretary Jim Peyser cautioned legislators against hiding behind the "stalking horse" of calls for the state to scrap next year's MCAS exam, suggesting such efforts are just a precursor to trying to eliminate standardized testing completely.
 Peyser, testifying at an Education Committee oversight hearing, said the test to be administered this coming spring after a 2020 hiatus will be important to understanding how much learning students lost during the pandemic.
 And to prevent them from losing any more ground, Peyser, Baker and Education Commissioner Jeff Riley said it's important that students return to the classroom, even as COVID-19 cases rise and fears of a fall surge become realized.
 The administration continues to assert that schools have not proven to be transmission grounds for the virus, and can be safely operated. Peyser and Baker both said that even if a community moves into the "red" category, schools that are open should stay that way unless there was a specific outbreak in the school system.
 As for that red zone, communities are finding it easier to get there than the New England Patriots these days.
 Fifty-four new cities and towns found themselves in the state's highest risk category this week, meaning more than a third of the state is now shaded red. That's part of why Massachusetts found itself on Connecticut's travel quarantine list week, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo cautioned New Yorkers to stay out of Massachusetts if they can avoid it.
 The rise in COVID-19 infection might have prompted a debate over voter turnout in next Tuesday's election had vote-by-mail not become so popular. But as it stood Thursday, nearly 44 percent of all registered voters had already cast their ballots, and turnout was equal to 62.4 percent of the total ballots cast in the 2016 elections.
 Of the more than 2 million votes cast, nearly 1.3 million had voted by mail, including Gov. Baker. Baker told the News Service Friday he had already voted by mail, but did not say if or who he had voted for in the presidential contest.
 Earlier in the week, Baker and Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, jointly, came out against ranked-choice voting as a too complicated reform that would discourage participation and be too costly at a time when public officials should be focused on making it easier for people to participate.
 His position put him at odds with leaders of both parties, including former Gov. Bill Weld, a Republican and prominent Yes on 2 supporter, but it also had echoes of one used by Democrats like Jerry Brown in California to veto similar voting reforms.

Jolene Menard grew up a stone's throw from the Wilks Library in New Bedford's North End. As a kid, she spent rainy days reading Shel Silverstein and Judy Blume books.
 Little did she know, a couple of decades later, she'd be reading her own children's book to her own twin boys.
 Menard, one of two female firefighters in the New Bedford Fire Department, originally published her mostly autobiographical illustrated children's book "Anything I Want" in 2019, but after a series of revisions, rewording and restructuring, she finally unveiled the book publicly this summer.
 "My kids love it," she said. "They love seeing my picture on the back and the pictures of the fire scenes."
 Menard was inspired to write the book after watching a 60 Minutes segment that looked into why only 25 percent of children's books feature a female lead, and why so often that lead is still being rescued by a male character.
 "I wanted to be a part of our children's future and inspiring young girls," Menard said. "I have sons, so young boys as well, but it's mainly for the little girls out there who wouldn't normally think about these types of jobs. Or they can't figure out what they want to do. I was inspired to empower young girls."
 The story, which Menard initially wrote in 30 minutes while pregnant three years ago, tells the tale of a young girl, Charlotte Marie -- who is named after Menard's niece -- who imagines all the possible jobs she might have when she grows up: Soldier, pilot, deep-sea diver and firefighter.
 The book, which is self-published through AuthorHouse, skips forward to Charlotte as an adult. She joins the Army and is deployed overseas, swims with dolphins, studies and becomes a firefighter and, finally, authors a children's book.
 It reads a lot like a rhyming autobiography of Menard, who joined the National Guard at age 17, before she even graduated from New Bedford High.
 "I didn't want to go to college and I wanted to do something cool," she said. "I had the energy for it. I wanted to go to boot camp."
 After September 11, 2001, her unit, the 772nd Military Police Company out of Taunton, was called up. First, they were sent to protect Otis Air Force Base, then they were deployed to Afghanistan.
 In 2005, she was hired by the New Bedford Fire Department. In 2009, she became a certified SCUBA diver. The only thing featured in the book she hasn't done is fly a plane.
 "It was easy for me to write because it's my life," she said. "It shows you'll have to work for what you want and to make sure whatever you're doing, you're enjoying."
 She used her childhood love of poetry, which she would write with her cousin, to pen the first draft. She wrote it while pregnant -- she was the first New Bedford firefighter to work while pregnant -- but she didn't know the gender of her pending arrivals.
 "There's all girls in my family and if I had a daughter I wanted her to know she can do whatever she puts her mind to," said Menard, who has three nieces. "I want her to see that girls can be main characters in books without having to be rescued."
 Beyond the plot, the book features several homages to her own life. The main character is named after her 7-year-old niece and goddaughter. The dog is named Ralf after her own rescue. On the cover two boys walk through a park. Those are her twin 3-year-olds, Michael and Jacob.
 Menard, who lives on an apple orchard in Acushnet, has been wanting to hold book signings, but has been unable during the COVID-19 pandemic. She sees herself writing more children's books in the future, possibly using other aspects of her own life, like her time playing roller derby and working at Carabiner's. She might also incorporate jobs she hasn't held, like state policeman or doctor.
 "I already have a bunch of different book ideas," she said. "I could probably do two or three right now, but I want to take my time and work them out."

The animals are often caught in crude snares and recently the group received a pangolin cut deeply through its torso by a snare, almost from stomach to back, said Wright, at the Johannesburg Wildlife Veterinary Hospital, where rescued pangolins are cared for.
 The animals are treated, put on a drip for rehydration, tube-fed a specially designed recovery diet, and sedated so they sleep for up to 48 hours. Then they are moved to undisclosed locations so the wildlife hospital isn't targeted by poachers.
 “They have been looked at, poked, prodded, shipped around from place to place, opened up and looked at again," said Wright. “Rest is the most important thing, next to the physical recovery.”
 Pangolins are intriguing creatures. The scales are made of keratin, the same substance in human fingernails, and are incredibly tough. That extra-long and dexterous tongue is an expert ant-catching tool. When not in use, it rolls back into a special sheath in the pangolin's chest cavity.
 Shy, pangolins will curl up into a tight ball when threatened. It’s a useful defensive mechanism against predators and also protects against swarming ants if dinner time gets out of hand. But it makes them easier to catch and transport by poachers.
 The pangolin group's chairman, Prof. Raymond Jansen, recorded 97 tons of pangolin scales seized from smugglers trying to take them out of Africa last year, equating to about 150,000 poached animals. Jansen estimates it's only about 20% of the total figure as the rest eludes authorities.

Longlou township in Wenchang, south China’s Hainan province, has enjoyed a boom in tourism and great changes in people’s lives after a spacecraft launch site was located in the locality.      In recent years, Wenchang has constantly tapped into its ties with China’s aerospace projects following the construction of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in Longlou township, initiating a great number of supporting projects and relevant projects designed to benefit the people.      The construction and completion of a series of aerospace-themed projects, such as community, park, and science center, have not only facilitated the construction of the national project, but speeded up the growth of local economy and society.      Located at a corner of Wenchang, Longlou township used to be a small township with less than 30,000 people.      Villages of the township were hidden in dense jungles and bushes, and the dilapidated streets of the township had neither thriving businesses nor many visitors, not to mention the limited sources of income of local residents.      Since the construction of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site started in 2009, Wenchang has made efforts to transform Longlou into a special aerospace-themed township.      Thanks to the efforts, local-style dwellings with carved gray tiles, arched doors and corridors have been integrated ingeniously with aerospace elements, giving the small town unique charm.      Great changes in Longlou township have led to the prosperity of various industries.      After its transformation, Longlou township has drawn increasing attention of investors, which were followed by the opening of a great number of inns, hotels, electrical appliance and furniture malls with the word “aerospace” literally in their names.      By the year 2019, the number of shops in Longlou township had surged from 230 to more than 900, while the number of hotels and inns in the township had risen from 5 to 46 and the number of large supermarkets and business centers had reached 13. More than 5,000 jobs had been created, thanks to these businesses.      From 2009 to 2019, the town’s GDP rose by 23.6 times, and the income of rural residents secured an annual increase of 19.7 percent.      When the Long March-5 Y3 carrier rocket was launched in the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in December 2019, about 170,000 tourists flocked to Longlou township to witness the special moment.      On July 23, 2020, nearly 200,000 visitors came to the site for the launching of Tianwen-1, China’s first mission to Mars. The inns, hotels and restaurants in Longlou township were packed with tourists.      Hotel rooms were fully booked for the launching day one month before the event, and many customers reserved rooms for three consecutive days, said Wang Anxing, director of operations of a hotel in Longlou township, who added that the hotel even rented out its 400-square-meter cafe to meet the demands of customers.      The “space craze” has greatly stimulated the tourism industry in Wenchang. In 2019, the city witnessed a total tourism revenue of about 1.97 billion yuan ($290 million), a year-on-year increase of 26.1 percent.      During the construction of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, the city relocated more than 3,000 farmers to resettlement sites with spacious and comfortable houses, and helped 138 poverty-stricken residents secure employment or start their own businesses in the locality, ensuring that their living standards and quality of life improve steadily.      Under the encouragement and guidance of the local government, many residents have grasped the opportunities generated by the construction of the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site and started to earn living by running restaurants, teahouses and shops in Longlou township.      The hotel that Wang works for is the first large hotel in Longlou township. Wang, who is a 35-year-old local resident of Longlou township, used to work in large cities of Hainan like Sanya.      “When I worked in big cities, I could earn about several thousand yuan at most per month,” Wang said, adding that he had often been confused about his career when he worked in those big cities.      After returning to his hometown and finding a job in the hotel, Wang gradually mapped out his career. The man said he never wants to leave his hometown and work in strange cities again.      Wang is now on a steady income of over 90,000 yuan every year at the hotel. At his leisure, he also helps run a teahouse that his family opened in the town.      Chen Manli, owner of a restaurant in Longlou township, received 30 tables of customers on July 23, the day when Tianwen-1 was launched. According to Chen, still many visitors came to her restaurant the next day.      Chen is a resident in Chitu village of Longlou township. After she was relocated from the village, she first opened a roadside diner with her husband to sell duck soup.      They have developed the diner into a large food court selling special dishes of Wenchang, including a course containing clams, lobsters, abalones, and sea urchins. The authentic local cuisine has made her restaurant increasingly popular among consumers.      With the gradual improvement in the infrastructure of Wenchang, especially the construction of Qinglan Bridge, Haiwen Bridge and a 99-kilometer-long tourism highway that connects the two bridges, it has become easier for residents in Wenchang to get around.      In the past, it took at least one to two hours for people to travel from Dongjiao township of the city to Wencheng township in downtown Wenchang by ferry or boat. On windy days or evenings, the boat would usually be just cancelled.      Such inconvenience was finally ended in 2012, when Qinglan Bridge was completed and opened to traffic.      Over 400 years ago, a devastating earthquake separated Puqian township of Wenchang and the adjacent city Haikou, capital city of Hainan province, with the sea and made Puqian a relatively isolated area.      It was until 2019 when Haiwen Bridge was built that Puqian township was once again connected with Haikou.      The two bridges and the highway have served as the backbone of Wenchang’s transportation and infused strong impetus into the development of the city.      The city is now making great efforts to promote the construction of Wenchang International Aerospace City, a major project of China and Hainan province.

With less than two months to go before the planned return of sports in Washington, the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association announced Tuesday that 50 percent of schools must meet its coronavirus metrics for seasons to begin, putting state championships at risk of being eliminated.
 However, the organization also said regions below the 50 percent threshold will have the option to combine with another classification. Some sort of regional championships could be a possibility. The WIAA’s executive board outlined the process in a meeting Monday.
 “(We’re) not eliminating it,” WIAA sports and activities information director Casey Johnson told the Seattle Times. “But certain things would have to happen.”
 The WIAA in September released updated requirements for sports to return. In football, as an example, there must be fewer than 25 cases per 100,000 people during a 14-day period and the positivity rate must be less than 5 percent. In other words, there must be a low risk of transmission in order to safely conduct competitions.
 Pullman athletic director Chris Franklin last week said the COVID-19 rate in Whitman County, which has been on the rise in recent months, must decrease.
 “I think it’s a ‘wait and see’ right now,” Franklin said. “The numbers in Pullman have to go down.”
 As of Wednesday, there have been 1,854 reported cases of COVID-19 in Whitman County. The region is in the red category, meaning a high risk of community spread. There have been 17 deaths.
 The WIAA will monitor the eligibility of schools based on the number of cases reported in their counties, using data provided on Washington’s Risk Assessment Dashboard.
 The final decision will be made three weeks before the beginning of the season. The organization previously set a Dec. 28 start for winter sports.
 A region would need eight eligible schools in a classification in a sport to hold a regional championship, according to the Seattle Times.
 Pullman High School is conducting classes online, so in-person classes must return before sports can return at the school.
 “It’s hard to plan right now,” Franklin said last week. “(We’re) planning on following WIAA guidelines … so we’ll see what happens.”

Louisiana voters passed a measure asserting there is no state constitutional right to abortion — something that could come into play if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns its Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.
 In Colorado, by contrast, voters defeated a measure to prohibit abortions after 22 weeks unless the pregnant woman's life is endangered. Previous Colorado ballot initiatives to limit abortion also failed in 2008, 2010 and 2014.
 Several states also were considering measures affecting voting rights.
 Virginia voters passed a constitutional amendment taking power away from members of the Democratic-led Legislature to draw voting districts for themselves and members of Congress based on census results. It instead will create a bipartisan commission of lawmakers and citizens to develop a redistricting plan that the Legislature could approve or reject, but not change.
 Virginia is the sixth state in the past two general election cycles to pass measures intended to prevent gerrymandering — a process in which politicians draw voting districts to benefit themselves or their political parties. Voters in Missouri, which passed a redistricting reform measure in 2018, voted Tuesday on whether to roll back key parts of it before it can be used next year.
 The Missouri measure, which remained undecided in a close vote, would repeal a nationally unique model using a nonpartisan demographer to draw state House and Senate districts to achieve "partisan fairness" and "competitiveness." Republicans who control the Legislature put forth a new ballot measure this year that would return redistricting duties to a pair of bipartisan commissions and drop "partisan fairness" and "competitiveness" to the end of the criteria.
 In Florida, voters approved a measure gradually increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. The measure puts Florida in line with at least seven other states — California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York — and Washington, D.C., which already have enacted laws to gradually boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
 In Mississippi, voters approved a proposal for a new state flag with a magnolia design. The vote came after legislators in June ended the use of a flag bearing a Confederate battle emblem. In Rhode Island, whose official name is "Rhode Island and Providence Plantations," residents in a close vote were deciding whether to eliminate the final three words, which some say evoke a legacy of slavery.
 Tax proposals were on the ballot in more than a dozen states. Tobacco tax hikes passed in Colorado and Oregon. Colorado voters also approved a slight income tax cut. Still undecided were a proposed property tax increase on California businesses and higher income taxes on the wealthy in Illinois and Arizona. The additional tax revenue in Arizona would fund pay raises for teachers and other school personnel.
 Another of the many California ballot issues would repeal a 1996 initiative that prohibits affirmative action programs granting preferential treatment based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in public employment, education or contracting.

Ethiopia’s Nobel Peace Prize-winning prime minister on Wednesday ordered the military to confront the country’s Tigray regional government after he said it carried out a deadly attack on a military base overnight, citing months of “provocation and incitement” and declaring “the last red line has been crossed.”
 The statement by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s office, and the reported attack by the well-armed Tigray People’s Liberation Front, immediately raised concerns that one of Africa’s most populous and powerful countries could plunge back into war. That would send a shock wave through the Horn of Africa and beyond.
 Addressing the nation on TV, Mr. Abiy announced “several martyrs” in the attack in Mekele, the northern Tigray region’s capital, and Dansha town. The prime minister said “the end is near” for the regional force, which is based in Ethiopia’s most sensitive region, neighboring Eritrea. The two countries made peace in 2018 after a long border war.
 The TPLF had been the dominant part of Ethiopia’s governing coalition before Mr. Abiy took office in 2018 and announced sweeping political reforms that won him the Nobel last year. Those reforms, however, have opened space for old ethnic and other grievances. The TPLF, feeling marginalized, left the coalition last year. It remains a strong military force, observers say.
 Ethiopia on Wednesday declared a six-month state of emergency in the Tigray region, saying that “illegal and violent activities within the National Regional State of Tigray are endangering the constitution and constitutional order, public peace and security, specially threatening the country’s sovereignty.”
 There was no immediate word from the TPLF, and all internet and phone lines were cut in the Tigray region following the announcement. Tigray TV reported that airspace has been closed over the region, and it asserted that the northern command of Ethiopia’s military had defected to the Tigray government. The prime minister’s office told the defection report was “not true.”
 Ethiopia was already stressed by a dispute with Egypt over a massive Ethiopian dam project that has drawn rare attention by President Donald Trump to Africa, and by a multi-layer crisis with the COVID-19 pandemic, deadly ethnic violence and a locust outbreak.
 Now the greatest test of Mr. Abiy’s rule has has come.
 Tigray officials have objected to the postponement of Ethiopia’s national election, once set for August, because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the extension of Mr. Abiy’s time in office.
 On Sunday, a senior TPLF official, Getachew Reda, told the AP his side will not accept a negotiation with the federal government.
 “What we need now is a national dialogue, not a negotiation,” he said. The TPLF says the release of detained former officials is one precondition to opening talks.
 In September, people in Tigray voted in a local election, defying the federal government and increasing political tensions. Last month the federal government moved to send funding for the region to local administrations instead of the regional government, angering TPLF officials.
 “This war is the worst possible outcome of the tensions that have been brewing,” William Davison, International Crisis Group’s senior analyst for Ethiopia, said Wednesday, urging a ceasefire. “Given Tigray’s relatively strong security position, the conflict may well be protracted and disastrous.”
 Mr. Abiy’s statement asserted that the TPLF attacked a military base in Tigray early Wednesday and attempted to take artillery and other equipment. The statement accused the TPLF of arming and organizing irregular militias.
 After months of “extreme patience” by the federal government, “a war however cannot be prevented only on the goodwill and decision of one side,” the prime minister’s statement said. “The last red line has been crossed with this morning’s attacks and the federal government is therefore forced into a military confrontation” to save the country.
 Observers have worried for months about the growing tensions and their implications for the long-turbulent Horn of Africa region, where Mr. Abiy cast himself as a peacemaker shortly after taking office.
 A report by the United States Institute of Peace said the fragmentation of Ethiopia “would be the largest state collapse in modern history, likely leading to mass interethnic and interreligious conflict ... and a humanitarian and security crisis at the crossroads of Africa and the Middle East on a scale that would overshadow the existing conflicts in South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen.”
 The international community needs to rally around the idea of national dialogue in Ethiopia, the International Crisis Group warned a week ago.
 “The alternative, given the country’s multiple and bitter divides, is a potential march to war that would be catastrophic for Africa’s second most populous country and would send shock waves, and refugees, into other Horn of Africa countries as well as across the Mediterranean,” the group wrote.

Today we're building heavy duty shelving.
 Heavy Duty, i.e. able or designed to withstand unusual strain and demanding use. So, how do these terms relate to shelving? Basically, our shelves will need to support items that weigh up to 30kg (66 lbs.).
 Where does this number come from? Essentially, it's what one bag of cement weighs, which according to the new labor norms, is the level of mass the average able bodied person should be able to safely, and with minimum risk of injury or cardiac arrest, hoist into space.
 Back in my olden days, otherwise known as the 1970's, bags of cement weighed 40 kg, or 88 lbs. Were able bodied people more able bodied back then? Well, if you listen to the old-timers I play hockey with, absolutely, even though their joints are presently being held together with a combination of various mechanical braces and duct tape, no doubt related to having hoisted 88 lb. bags of cement, or equivalent weighted things, onto their shoulders in the past.
 So, for those able bodied persons today, and those of yesteryear, who really shouldn't be participating in anything without first confirming that the site has a working defibrillator, these HD shelves will be able to handle plenty of abuse.
 The convenient aspect to our heavy-duty shelving is that we're only going to require three components, ¾ inch plywood, 2x3x8 spruce, and wood screws. The ¾" plywood could be of the spruce sheeting variety, which has a slightly rougher texture, or be made of BC Fir, aka good one side plywood, which has a smooth texture, and convenient if you'll be repeatedly placing things on and off the shelf.
 Avoid particle board, thinner plywood's, or OSB (aka Aspenite) type of sheeting's as shelving options. You may save a few dollars per sheet, but the shelves might sag, or crack if something exceptionally heavy is dropped onto the shelf.
 Choose 2×3 lumber to serve as the legs and support brackets. 2×4 studs would serve the purpose also, but they'll cost you a couple of bucks more per piece. Plus, the 2×3 studs will provide you with all the support strength you'll need, and take up a little less space.

Republican U.S. Rep. Dan Bishop won reelection in the 9th Congressional District Tuesday night, leading Democratic challenger Cynthia Wallace roughly 56% to 44% on Tuesday night, according to preliminary results from the North Carolina State Board of Elections.
 Bishop, a Charlotte attorney and social conservative, held in his Election Night party in heavily Republican Union County.
 "The people are showing up for America, ladies and gentlemen," Bishop said. "So, I wanna say, we entered that race last year in that special election, and lots of people in this room worked and worked and faced down the nay-sayers."
 Bishop is a former Mecklenburg County commissioner and state senator. As a member of the General Assembly, he was a co-sponsor of House Bill 2, the so- called “bathroom bill” that required people to use the bathroom in government- owned buildings that matches that gender on their birth certificate. That law was later overturned.
 The district runs from south Charlotte to Robeson County.
 Last year, a three-judge panel ordered the General Assembly to redraw the state’s congressional and state legislative maps.
 As a result, the 9th was tweaked, becoming slightly more Democratic. President Trump won the old 9th District by just under 11 percentage points in 2016.
 Two years ago, the 9th District was one of the most high-profile races in the nation as Democrats tried to retake the House of Representatives.
 Democrats failed to win that seat twice, after spending millions.
 Dan McCready lost a close race to Mark Harris in the 2018 midterms, but the State Board of Elections voted for a second election because of alleged absentee mail ballot fraud by a Republican political operation. In a 2019 special election, Bishop defeated McCready.
 "I think it's safe to say we sealed the deal," Bishop said Tuesday night.
 After those two losses, national Democrats declined to spend money this year in the 9th. They instead focused their money and energy in the 8th District, which runs from Cabarrus County to Cumberland County.
 Wallace works in financial services in Charlotte. She is the former Democratic Party chair for the 9th District.
 For both candidates, it was difficult to cut through the noise of the presidential election and the high-profile U.S. Senate race between Republican Thom Tillis and Democrat Cal Cunningham.
 Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallace only did a little in-person campaigning. She advertised on cable TV and social media, but the race did not capture voters' attention as the 9th District did two years ago.
 Because of that court-ordered redraw of the congressional maps, Democrats picked up two seats on Tuesday.
 Democrat Kathy Manning won in the 6th District in Greensboro and Democrat Deborah Ross won the 2nd District in Raleigh.
 Going into the election, Republicans held a 10-3 advantage in the state’s congressional delegation. Because of those two wins, Democrats will at least have five seats from North Carolina in Congress.

Georgia and North Carolina are also too close to call, though Trump holds a narrow lead in both with more than 90 per cent of the ballot counted.
 Election officials have already warned that it could take days for some states - Wisconsin and Pennsylvania among them - to declare their final result.
 This is because of a surge in the number of people, particularly Democrats, voting by mail-in ballot - which take longer to count.
 It also opens up the possibility of a protracted and bitter legal fight that could go all the way to the Supreme Court - as happened in Florida with Bush vs Gore in 2000.
 In that case, it took more than a month for the winner of the state - and by extension the presidency - to be declared. It ultimately went to Bush, by less than 600 votes.
 Donald Trump all-but declared victory in a speech from the White House on Wednesday morning, saying 'as far as I'm concerned, we won this election'.
 He claimed to have won in both North Carolina and Georgia, where results have not been finalised, and suggested Arizona - which AP has declared for Biden - could still come back his way.
 Trump also spoke of a 'fraud on the American people' while suggesting the fight could end up in court, pointing the finger of blame squarely at the Democrats.
 It came after Biden gave his own speech to the faithful in Delaware, saying he is 'on track to win this election' but urging followers to 'be patient' and wait for the final counts to come in.
 On Twitter, he added: 'It's not my place or Donald Trump's place to declare the winner of this election. It's the voters' place.'

In the past five years, China has unswervingly expanded opening-up, worked faster to bring domestic systems and rules in line with international ones, opened its door wider to the world and continued to raise the level of opening-up.      The country has put into effect the foreign investment law across the board to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors, successively cut tariffs, taken the initiative to expand imports, accelerated institutional innovations and promoted higher-standard opening-up.      China has eased market access in more areas. On Sept. 2, Citibank (China) Co., Ltd. announced that it had received a domestic fund custody license from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, China’s securities regulator, and became the first American bank to be granted such a license.      “We are pleased to participate in and play a steady role in the reform and development of China’s financial markets. This license is further validation of China’s commitment to continue opening up its financial markets,” said Stuart Staley, head of Markets and Securities Services, Citi Asia Pacific.      Since 2018, China has notably accelerated the opening of its financial sector, as the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission have successively announced and promoted the implementation of more than 50 specific opening-up measures. The financial sector is an epitome of the country’s efforts to relax controls on market access and attract foreign investment.      During the “13th Five-Year Plan” period (2016-2020), China has rolled out the foreign investment law and the regulations regarding its implementation, which established the system of pre-establishment national treatment plus a negative list in legal terms and canceled across the board the approval and filing procedures for the establishment and change of foreign enterprises.      The country has revised its negative lists for foreign investment market access for four consecutive years, cutting the restrictive measures to 33 from 93, and granting national treatment to foreign investors.      Last year, China rolled out a new version of the catalog of industries that encourage foreign investment, which contains 1,108 items, including 415 items for encouraging foreign investment nationwide.      The new catalog for encouraging foreign investment nationwide has 67 newly- added items and 45 modified items compared with the 2017 version, continuing to expand the investment scope for foreign investors.      Meanwhile, China has innovated trade models to promote higher-standard opening-up. On Sept. 1, 1,081 air humidifiers produced by Guangdong Titan Smart Electrical Appliances Co., Ltd. were shipped abroad from the logistics park of the bonded logistics center in Zhongshan city, south China’s Guangdong province.      “The customs’ program for cross-border e-commerce B2B export allows us to directly export goods to overseas warehouses, greatly shortening the time for customs clearance and cutting logistics costs,” said the company’s chairman Li Hui.      Since July 1, ten regional customs directly under China’s General Administration of Customs, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Nanjing, have piloted a supervision model to boost cross-border e-commerce B2B export. So far, 22 customs have been added to the pilot program.      Under the new supervision model, e-commerce B2B exporters are given support in various forms, including streamlined procedure, expedited clearance, customs transit, and prior inspection.      In the first half of 2020, the value of imports and exports transacted online by cross-border e-commerce enterprises exceeded 600 billion yuan (about $89.7 billion), up by 6.7 percent. New business models such as cross-border e-commerce are constantly creating new drivers for the development of the country’s foreign trade.      China has also adopted measures such as boosting the rapid development of new types of foreign trade, hosting China International Import Expos, cutting tariffs, and deepening reform in integrated customs clearance procedures.      During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, China has steadily improved the quality of its foreign trade by optimizing the business environment at ports, taking the initiative to open up its market and expand imports, and promoting the innovative development of foreign trade.      With a total foreign trade volume of goods of 31.54 trillion yuan, the country remained the world’s largest trader in goods in 2019.      This year, China has become a bright spot in the gloomy global trade despite the severe impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. The country’s total foreign trade volume of goods reached 20.05 trillion yuan in the first eight months, down 0.6 percent year on year. The drop narrowed by 1.1 percentage points compared with the decline from January to July.      By making opening-up a catalyst for reform and development, China’s opening-up has gathered stronger momentum.      In the Lianyungang area of China (Jiangsu) Pilot Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in east China’s Jiangsu province, goods are loaded to ships in an orderly manner.      As the country’s first demonstration port of rail-sea intermodal transport services of containers, the Lianyungang area has initiated models such as mix containers of bonded and export products, and direct vehicle services and shipping with zero waiting time for customs supervision, which effectively improved the traffic efficiency of international freight trains.      China has also advanced in-depth market-based reforms with high-standard opening-up. In August 2019, the country launched six pilot FTZs in Shandong, Jiangsu, Guangxi, Hebei, Yunnan, and Heilongjiang provinces, as well as the new Lingang area of the China (Shanghai) FTZ.      In September 2020, the country released a master plan for three new pilot FTZs in Beijing, Hunan province and Anhui province, and adopted a plan to expand the pilot FTZ in Zhejiang province.      During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, China has newly added 17 pilot FTZs, bringing the number of its pilot FTZs to 21, which expanded from the coastal provinces to central, northeast, northwest, and southwest China.      China’s more FTZs with higher quality demonstrate its new endeavors for opening-up and its confidence and determination to respond to external challenges through efforts to expand opening-up.

The announcement comes after the Middle East states in August agreed to establish formal ties, including launching direct flights between the two countries.
 Dubai state-owned flydubai will operate 14 weekly services between the UAE's and Israel's financial capitals from Nov 26, it said on its website.
 Tickets for those flights were now on sale.
 Dubai's Emirates, the UAE's biggest airline, will sell tickets on the flydubai service through a codeshare agreement between the carriers, an Emirates spokeswoman said.
 UAE and Israeli citizens are able to visit each others' country without applying for a visa before travelling as part of agreements recently signed between the two states.
 Israeli airlines Israir and Arkia have advertised packages to Dubai for flights starting on Dec. 9, but say they are yet to receive final approval for the flights.
 El Al Israel Airlines, the country's biggest airline, has not advertised flights. The aviation industry is enduring its worst crisis after the coronavirus pandemic this year crippled most flights.

 Robson and Hawker garnered 20 percent and 18 percent of the vote, respectively.
 In the Kyrene Governing Board race, where five candidates are battling for three seats,
 incumbent Michelle Fahy took the lead with 24 percent of the vote, followed by Wanda Kolomyjec with

 The Associated Press called the race at 7:42 p.m.
 Gardner's Senate seat has been among Democrats' top targets since President Donald Trump's 5-point loss in Colorado in 2016 and the state electorate's sharp turn to the left in the 2018 midterm election, leading political observers to peg Gardner as the most vulnerable Republican senator on the ballot this year.
 The race is seen as key to Democrats' hopes of taking the majority in the Senate, which will require a net gain of four seats, or three seats if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris win the White House.
 Hickenlooper's win was the first Democratic Senate pickup, according to the AP, which reported at 8 p.m. that other battleground races were still too close to call.
 Polling has consistently shown Hickenlooper with a wide lead over Gardner, whose approval rating among Colorado voters has languished below 40% since Trump took office.
 Hickenlooper, a 68-year-old former two-term mayor of Denver and two-term governor, entered politics following a successful career launching Colorado's brewpub industry after he was laid off from his job as a petroleum geologist.
 The quirky, sometimes tongue-tied former bartender who described himself during a brief run for the Democratic presidential nomination as "exactly the opposite of President Trump" kept the heat on Gardner's fealty to the president.
 Throughout the campaign, Hickenlooper made hay with Gardner's repeated attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, including support for a lawsuit backed by the Trump administration that Democrats warn could strip health care coverage from millions in the midst of a pandemic.
 The 46-year-old Gardner countered by portraying himself as an independent voice with a stack of legislative accomplishments unmatched in the state's delegation, including steering landmark conservation legislation across the finish line this year and landing the temporary headquarters of the new Space Force in Colorado Springs.
 Gardner and his Republican allies also poured millions of dollars into advertising attacking Hickenlooper for a pair of state gift ban violations when he was governor, as well as reminding voters that Hickenlooper protested that he wasn't cut out for the Senate when national Democrats were trying to persuade him last year to jump from the presidential primary.

PHOENIX -- It’s probably too early for Democrats to start measuring for drapes.
 But very early returns Tuesday evening suggest there’s a decent chance they could take control of both the state Senate and the state House. And they haven’t run that latter chamber since 1964.
 Four incumbent Republican senators were running behind their Democrat foes: Vince Leach of Tucson, J.D. Mesnard of Chandler, Paul Boyer of Phoenix and Kate Brophy McGee of Phoenix, though in some cases the margins were razor thin. Leach, for example, was just 113 votes behind Democrat JoAnna Mendoza, with more votes still coming in from Pinal County.
 And Republican Wendy Rogers, who won the right to represent the GOP on the ballot for the Legislative District 6 senate seat in northeast Arizona , was running behind Felicia French.
 Democrats just need to win in two of those races to create a tie in the 30-member Senate. A third would put them in control.
 Across the courtyard, the hurdle for Democrats to seize power is a bit less.
 Republicans have just a 31-29 edge in the House. So it takes just the loss of one GOP seat to create a tie and two for a Democrat majority.
 Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans, the lone Democrat in the race for the House two seats in District 6, was running ahead of both Republicans. But with two seats up for grabs, it appears that incumbent Walt Blackman will hang on for another term while a bid by Brenda Barton to return to the House after a two-year absence is faltering.
 In LD 8, Democrat Sharon Girard was outpolling incumbents David Cook. But with only one Democrat in the race for the two seats, it appeared that Frank Pratt may return for another two years.
 Also in early trouble were Republicans Bret Roberts of Maricopa and Mark Finchem of Oro Valley, both running behind in early results to Democrat Felipe Perez in LD 11.
 And in LD 20, lone Democrat Judy Schwiebert was leading incumbents Shawnna Bolick and Anthony Kern.
 At the same time, the early results showed only one incumbent Democrat, Gerae Peten in danger of losing her House seat to Republican challenger, Joel John, in LD 4, with just three votes separating them late Tuesday.
 Democrats controlled the Senate in 1991 and 1992, only to lose control back to Republicans in the 1992 race.
 A 15-15 ties in the 2000 race resulted in shared control of the Senate with President Randall Gnant, a Republican, agreeing to let Democrats chair half of all committees for the two years of his term.

Republican Catherine Truitt was chosen superintendent of North Carolina's K-12 public schools Tuesday.
 In her first run for office, Truitt took 51.4% of the vote to Democrat Jen Mangrum's 48.6%, according to the final but unofficial count. Truitt is a former teacher who is chancellor of the online Western Governors University North Carolina.
 Mark Johnson, a Republican who has held the job for the past four years, wasn't on the ballot after making an unsuccessful primary run for lieutenant governor.
 The superintendent is a post without a lot of official power, but it comes with high visibility to influence the state Board of Education, the General Assembly and the governor, all of whom make decisions about public education. Truitt will step in as decision-makers grapple with COVID-19, equity and a persistent struggle to teach children to read.
 Truitt says she has the background and skills to work with all the players in the public education scene — including local superintendents.
 For instance, she says she wants local leaders to have more authority over whether to close schools or bring students back during the pandemic. She also calls for changing the way teacher jobs are funded in ways she says will help local superintendents compete for top educators.
 "These kinds of innovations are only going to occur if we are all rowing in the same direction if someone is providing leadership that is about building consensus rather than grabbing power," Truitt said before the election.
 Truitt describes phonics-based instruction as the key to literacy — and to providing all students a shot at success in education and life.
 "This issue boils down to the battle between whole language and balanced literacy folks and phonics, which is also known as the science of reading," Truitt said.

BOISE, Idaho — Republican U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher was elected to a second term by Idaho voters Tuesday, a seat last held by a Democrat in 2011. Fulcher will continue to represent the 1st Congressional District in western Idaho after defeating Democrat Rudy Soto, who served nine years in the Army National Guard.
 Fulcher served in the Idaho Legislature, where he was known as among the more far-right leaning members. He has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business from Boise State University.
 Fulcher for years had his eyes set on becoming governor. He narrowly lost to then-Gov. C.L. “Butch” Otter in the 2014 Republican primary despite winning all three of Idaho’s most populated counties — all of which are in the 1st Congressional District.
 Soto, the son of a Mexican immigrant, has a platform that includes affordable health care coverage for everyone, backing environmental protections and holding corporate polluters accountable. He also promises to seek more funding for Idaho roads and schools.
 Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson retained his seat in Congress.
 Simpson will serve a 12th term representing the 2nd Congressional District in eastern Idaho after defeating Democrat Aaron Swisher.
 For Swisher, an economist who describes himself as having a blue-collar background, it was his second unsuccessful attempt to unseat Simpson, having also lost in 2018.
 Simpson, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee as well as a key subcommittee involving energy, has brought millions of federal dollars to the state for the Idaho National Laboratory, one of the nation’s primary nuclear research labs.
 Simpson also is known for cobbling together support among environmentalists, ranchers and local governments in 2015 to create three wilderness areas in central Idaho that combined protect some 463 square miles. With that support, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Jerry Peak Wilderness Additions Act passed both the House and Senate and was signed into law by President Barack Obama.

A nationwide push to relax drug laws took a significant step forward Tuesday as more states legalized marijuana for adults and voters made Oregon the first state to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of street drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine.
 The drug measures were among 120 proposed state laws and constitutional amendments that were on the ballot in 32 states. They touched on an array of issues that have roiled politics in recent years — voting rights, racial inequalities, abortion, taxes and education, to name a few.
 But none directly dealt with the dominant theme of 2020 — the coronavirus pandemic. That's because the process to put measures on the ballot began, in most cases, before the virus surged to the forefront.

The state of Oregon became the first in the nation to decriminalize small amounts of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine by overwhelmingly passing Measure 110 on Tuesday.
 According to The Oregonian, the measure will reduce misdemeanor drug possession to a non-criminal violation, punishable by measures similar to a traffic stop. Violators will be given a ticket and a $100 fine, or be given the option of being screened for a subtance abuse disorder.
 Those found with larger amounts of drugs, who would have previously been charged with a felony, will now face a misdemeanor charge. The measure also redirects tax revenue from the sale of legal marijuana in the state toward Addiction Recover Centers, where people are screened for drug use and can also receive treatment for drug addiction.
 Supporters of the measure say the new policy will reduce the state's jail population, and in particular, free many offenders of non-violent crimes. Supporters also say the bill will promote racial equality in the state, as drug laws disproportionately affect Black people and other people of color.
 Opponents of the measure say it promotes drug use and will lead to more overdose deaths and overwhelm addiction centers in the state.
 The Oregonian also reports that the measure received funding from many out-of- state donors, including Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
 The Associated Press reports that the measure passed with about 60% support.

Voters statewide also opted by a wide margin to retain Court of Appeals Judge Craig R. Welling, despite a tiny but vocal opposition campaign against him.
 Welling received a unanimously favorable recommendation from the commission that evaluates appellate judges and justices, but was the subject of a small- scale opposition campaign that began in 2018. Welling, a 2017 Hickenlooper appointee, was one of three judges on a panel who dismissed the charges against a convicted serial child abuser. The judges found the trial court violated the defendant's right to a speedy trial, and the General Assembly mandated dismissal in such circumstances.
 Justice for All, a political committee largely driven by Mesa County Commissioner-elect Janet Rowland, attempted to unseat Welling, but as of Nov. 2, the group had only $70 on hand. Voters retained Welling by a 71% to 29% margin.
 In total, 41 county court judges, 58 district court judges, two Court of Appeals judges and two Supreme Court justices were on the ballot. With the exception of Denver County Court judges, the governor appoints each judge for a provisional term of approximately two years, after which they must stand for retention at intervals ranging from four to 10 years.
 When the Office of Judicial Performance Evaluation published its retention narratives online in August, there were originally 104 judges reviewed. However, one judge subsequently withdrew their name from the ballot and opted to retire. Kent Wagner, the office's director, refused to identify the judge, explaining that because "the judge will no longer be in office at the end of the term, publishing the information would not be providing information to inform voter’s decisions which is our purpose."
 Since the establishment of the judicial retention system in Colorado in 1988, performance commissions in each of the state's 22 judicial districts evaluated judges against a set of criteria and made recommendations advising voters whether to retain or not retain individual judges.
 However, in 2017 the General Assembly modified the protocol. Beginning this year, performance commissions only notify voters whether a judge does or does not meet performance standards. The change was intended to make the work of the commissions less prescriptive.
 As of 2018, voters have retained 99% of the 1,559 judges on the ballot. In the last election cycle, all judges who received favorable recommendations kept their seats, while voters rejected those who did not.

 But for Jack Colombo, sports was never his forte, instead applying his creative skills in the field of music.
 Jack Colombo, 61, recalled going to a physical education class in high school led by his father's cousin, Armond Colombo, the late, renowned Brockton High School coach whose football teams won nine Eastern Mass. Division 1 Super Bowl championships.
 "I went to gym and Armond used to say, 'Go to the Fine Arts Building,'" Jack Colombo said. "My claim to fame is I'm the only Colombo who existed with no athletic ability."

 Colombo, a full-time musician and lifelong Brocktonian, was named a KORG USA- endorsed artist this year, as the keyboard company recognizes him for a career of accomplishments, including performances with 140 different acts with top 50 hit songs.
 Colombo, as a multi-keyboard performer, pianist, arranger and producer, has played with award-winning groups like The Drifters, featuring Charlie Thomas, serving as the group's music director for 23 years. He's also played concerts around the country and arranged music for The Lettermen, Al Jardine of The Beach Boys, The O'Jays, Bowzer of Sha Na Na, Ben E. King, Mary Wilson of The Supremes, The Manhattan Transfer and many others.
 Colombo is joining a long list of KORG artists that is highlighted by legends of the music industry like Phil Collins and Herbie Hancock.
 "I'm in good company," said Colombo, speaking recently by phone. "I'm humbly happy about it. It's a godsend. The opportunity doesn't come along people's way a lot. The keyboards are difficult endorsements. The products are a lot of money. It's different than drumsticks or guitar sponsorships. Those are more easy to come by."
 Colombo is founder, co-owner and an instructor at the Southeast School of Music in Easton.
 And Colombo has directed oldies music specials for PBS, made music for television commercials, served as music director for a Boston City Hall Plaza concert series, directed ballet pop concern series, provided a soundtrack for a Pittsburgh Steelers pre-game show, orchestrated a private Super Bowl celebration for the New England Patriots, directed music for the Catholic Tri- Parishes of Brockton and led national artist shows for Caribbean and Alaskan cruise companies. He also worked for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame as a musical director for three years. And he put together the The Drifters vocalists reunion in 2005 that aired on PBS.
 Colombo has shared his love of music with his daughter, Tori Colombo, a seventh grader at West Middle School, who has joined him on stage, including once with The Drifters playing percussion at just nine years old in 2017 at Stadium Theatre in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Jack Colombo said he started playing organ and piano at age 9, first playing professionally as a 16-year- old at local function halls and family parties, calling the rock organ his "first love."
 "It was really cool as a dad to see her on stage," Colombo said. "And it was really cool for them, too. She was the youngest person to ever perform with The Drifters. It was awesome."
 Colombo said his daughter also brought her percussion rig on stage to join him and Bowzer from Sha Na NA in front of an audience of 16,000 people at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Connecticut during an oldies rock concert in 2018.
 "I think it is crazy to have a dad that has played in front of thousands of people," Tori Colombo said, during a break from remote learning classes, congratulating her father on the Korg artist endorsement. "I'm really happy. He always works hard no matter what. I'm glad this happened for him. It's amazing how he gets recognized everywhere and how he's so talented on the piano. It really is a blessing to have a dad that amazing."
 Colombo said another cool moment in his career was when he was complimented by singer and songwriter Paul Simon, who was in the audience for a 60s music show headlined by The Drifters at the Bergen Performing Arts Center in New Jersey around five years ago or so.
 "I was in disbelief," said Colombo, adding that he would have been a lot more nervous performing had he known Simon was in the crowd. "He said, 'You know, I'm not a fan of four-piece groups, but you guys really pulled it off and it sounded amazing.' I thought that was an awesome compliment."
 When Colombo became a musical director for the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002, it opened up a new world for him, as he began to work with great singers, musicians and nationally renowned bands who made so many top hit songs.
 "I played with like 18 groups the first time around who had top hits, including Mary Wilson, The Manhattan Transfer and Al Jardine," Colombo said. "That kind of opened up that whole world and got me really involved in that circuit. Then everything became wide open. The floodgates opened up."

Some of that was courtesy of the coronavirus pandemic -- the 2020-21 NBA and NHL seasons normally would be in full swing, but the delayed finishes of their previous seasons pushed back the upcoming ones -- and some of it was because of Election Day. The NFL and Major League Soccer ordered everyone to take a day off. Similarly, the NCAA barred every top-division college team from playing or training.

Voters in Mississippi voted to approve a new state flag design.
 Lawmakers took action this summer to retire the former Mississippi state flag, which contained the Confederate battle emblem.
 The rebel symbol is widely seen as racist.
 In the last two months, the process to design and vote on a new flag has moved fast.
 There was a call to artists to help design a new flag. By law, the new flag must include the phrase, “In God We Trust,” and could not include any depictions of the Confederate battle flag.
 The designs were narrowed to five based on a public online vote and feedback. Then a commission narrowed it down to a final option.
 That option, including a magnolia, the state flower, and red, blue and yellow bands, was on the ballot for voters to approve.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has been reelected, defeating Republican challenger Lt. Gov. Dan Forest.
 The mild-mannered governor has often been reluctant to criticize President Donald Trump. He has been generally praised for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
 However, some complained he was slow to reopen K-12 public schools and certain parts of the economy. Forest often criticized the shuttering of small businesses, including bars, bowling alleys and gyms.
 Cooper had banked on the support of voters who approved of his handling of the coronavirus, while Forest had aimed to appeal to business owners and K-12 public school parents dissatisfied with the state’s slow reopening.
 “It’s time to do the hard work of healing because North Carolinians deserve that," Cooper said in an acceptance speech minutes after The Associated Press called the race in his favor. “It’s time that we focus on what we have in common rather than on our differences. Regardless of our political beliefs, most all of us want people to be healthy, have a good paying job and to live in safe communities.”
 Cooper highlighted issues of health care, education and racial inequality and said it was time to move on from a costly, combative gubernatorial election.
 The race attracted attention from outside groups, which spent millions to shape voter attitudes, and was among a few being closely watched nationwide.
 Cooper took in more than $17 million between July 1 and Oct. 17, with over $11 million being given by political party committees and $281,000 coming from other political committees, according to the campaign’s latest quarterly report filed with the State Board of Elections.
 Forest raised a substantially smaller $4 million during the same July 1 to Oct. 17 period. The campaign filing shows $532,000 came from political party committees and nearly $100,000 from other political committees.
 After the race was called, Forest alluded to the discrepancy and struggle to boost his name recognition at a time when Cooper has gotten more attention from the news media because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 “We were outraised by massive amounts of numbers, not only tens of millions of dollars, money coming in from all over the country for this governor's race, but having a governor that's an incumbent, and, with coronavirus, on TV every day for nine months," Forest said. “What an uphill battle it was, and we're like, that close.”
 Forest said he unsuccessfully tried multiple times to call Cooper on the phone to concede.
 “I did not get through to him, but I do wish him all the best,” Forest said. “We will be praying for the governor and his family and his leadership as we move forward and praying for the people of North Carolina. We certainly love this state and wish all goes well.”
 A spokesperson for the Cooper campaign did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment about whether Cooper had received a call and not accepted it.
 In North Carolina, Cooper avoided the physical campaign cycle this election, instead choosing to participate in a small number of virtual gatherings. Supporters of the mild-mannered Democrat believe he’s responsibly prioritized public safety.
 “I think Roy Cooper’s doing a great job,” said Ryan Commedo, a Fayetteville resident who took part in early, in-person voting. “He’s handling everything with the coronavirus and giving updates that we don’t get from the president. I think he cares about the people.”
 Forest had hosted several large in-person events with little to no mask wearing or physical separation between attendees. The lieutenant governor had called for a more aggressive reopening of businesses and schools and vowed to immediately repeal the statewide mask mandate Cooper enacted in response to rising coronavirus cases.
 It was too early to call the U.S. Senate and presidential contests in North Carolina. Cooper pushed for all votes to be properly accounted for.
 “For months, the nation has focused on North Carolina, and it's come down to counting the votes,” Cooper said. “I know that there are a lot of important races that are still too close to call, and we must let the process work to be sure that all the legal votes are counted.”

Avoid framing your shelving unit with 2×2 lumber. 2×2's serve well as supplementary nailing supports, but aren't structural, and won't provide the necessary strength long term. Although nails have a stronger sheer resistance than screws, nails are a somewhat permanent manner of assembly, and don't like to be pulled out once they're driven in. So, I suggest using screws to fasten things together.
 Screws provide for a quick assembly, and enable easier dismantling and re- assembly, should your future storage strategies change.
 Assembly? With one of our goals being to have as little cutting as possible, our shelving unit will be 8 feet wide by 8 feet high. First, and depending on the desired shelf depth, have your building supply center rip the 4'x8'sheets into either 16 or 24 inch widths.
 Then, attach a 2x3x8' stud (along the narrow edge, with the wider face showing) along both 8 foot edges of the 16" or 24" shelving sheets using 2" wood screws.
 Next, use 6 pieces of 2x3x8' studs to act as the legs and vertical supports, fastening one stud to the face of the 2×3 horizontal supports at each end, and one in the middle, using 3" screws. With the first shelf positioned a few inches off the floor, place the following shelves anywhere from 18-24 inches apart, providing plenty of space for stocking and removal of goods.
 Next, insert 2×3 blocking in between each shelf, fastened to the vertical uprights, and as a means of further preventing the shelf from succumbing to excess poundage.
 Finally, and not on the original list of items, if this unit is not to be fastened to a wall, and be totally self-standing, fasten a length of windbrace (aka amazing brace), diagonally along the back of the shelving unit, in order to keep things square and steady.
 That's HD shelving in a nutshell.
 Good building.

The healthcare sector is consistently touching new peaks each year on the back of the prevalence of several diseases and increasing disposable income among urban populations. Naturally, various aspects of this broad sector are gaining traction too, and sterilization services are one among them. The prosperity of the global sterilization services market is primarily a reflection of high contamination conditions that hospitals and healthcare facilities function under, which makes it very important for them to maintain an environment free from various life forms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, prions, and other spore forms that emerge from various food ingredients, medication and diagnostic equipment, and other biological culture medium. During the forecast period of 2017 to 2025, the demand in the global sterilization services market has been projected to increment at a healthy CAGR.
