"It is our hopes in everyday that we can have all of our daycares up and going," he said. "We need them to be able to take care of out children as our workers go to work. There's no question about that, but we absolutely can't risk anything to our children or anything that maybe our children could take back."
 Four daycare workers in Kanawha County recently tested positive for COVID-19, Justice said.
 "None of these people had any symptoms," he said.
 Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, adjutant general of the West Virginia National Guard, said one of the four cases is a staff member at the National Guard Child Development Center in Charleston.
 Dr. Kathy Slemp, state health officer and commissioner of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Public Health, said there are more than 600 daycare facilities in the state that provide care for more than 11,000 children.
 Testing at daycare facilities will be an "ongoing" process as more and more facilities prepare to reopen, Slemp said.
 "We're testing those individuals who are currently providing that care; as they expand out and add additional individuals who are joining on staff and then as some come on board we will be offering testing for each of those entities as they reopen," she said. "It will not be a one-time fix event."
 The state will also soon begin "targeted testing" for African-Americans, Justice said.

New Delhi:
 Wholesalers and retailers of drugs have been asked to maintain stocks of 55 drugs given to Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) and 96 medicines used for treating other chronic co-morbidities that increase the risk of complications and deaths.
 The directorate general of health services (DGHS) has prepared the list and the Drugs Controller General of India's office has forwarded it to the members of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), an industry body representing pharmacies and wholesalers in the pharma trade.
 "A detailed exercise has been undertaken by the DGHS which has prepared a list of 55 medicines for ICU management and another 96 drugs for general availability and treatment of various co-morbid conditions, which may be required during these times… In light of this current pandemic, it is absolutely essential that sufficient market availability of these drugs along with other essential drugs is ensured by your members. These steps will go a long way in the effective clinical management of the pandemic," said a note written by the Union health ministry's officer on special duty, Sudhansh Pant, to AIOCD.
 The drugs include vasopressors (used to raise low blood pressure), those used for arrhythmia (for irregular heart beat) and other cardiac emergencies, analgesics (pain killers), sedatives (sleeping pills), muscle relaxants, antibiotics and antimicrobial agents.
 The list also has an estimate of the consumption of drugs for 10 days in the ICU by one patient, 25 patients and 150 patients. A separate estimate has been given of drugs used to treat chronic health conditions across the country for the next three months.
 The list also includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as paracetamols, diclofenac sodium, ibuprofen; antibacterial agents such as albendazole, amoxicillin, ampicillin, azithromycin, doxycycline, ofloxacin etc. Other drugs include antifungal, antiviral, gastrointestinal, dermatological and anti-allergic ones, hormones, and vitamins.
 The estimated minimum quantity to be stocked is as per the World Health Organisation's recommended quantity per thousand population, which is between 10 and 4000 units per 1000 population.
 AIOCD, in turn, has sent out a directive to chemists regarding the listed drugs. "…as a precautionary measure, it has been advised to maintain optimum availability of listed 55 and 96 drugs sent to you all beforehand to avoid shortages in case of emergency for ICU patients. Hope you shall circulate this message to all your Chemists and Stockists in your States...," the AIOCD said in a letter.
 Retail Distributors Chemists Association president Sandeep Nangi called this a stock-taking exercise to ensure there is no shortage of any essential medicines. "The government does regular monitoring of the inventory. There is no shortage of any medicines as of now in the entire supply chain."
 Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram, said these drugs are readily available for patients in ICUs and others and that there has been no shortage. "The list by and large covers all essential medicines."

Following a national search, Lubbock Christian University has announced the appointment of Matt Bumstead as dean of the LCU School of Business.
   
 The longtime Lubbock business professional and civic leader was selected from a field of exceptional finalists and will begin his role at the beginning of the fall 2020 semester, following the retirement of current dean, Tracy Mack, LCU announced in a news release Wednesday.
   
 In 2016, Bumstead was appointed CEO-in-Residence for the LCU School of Business with the express purpose of engaging students from the perspective of his real-world professional experiences of integrating faith into the workplace, according to LCU.
   
 The capstone class he teaches for graduating seniors draws on his expertise as a practitioner to equip LCU business students to become Christ-centered industry leaders and to advance LCU's "business as ministry" initiative.
   
 "I have an overwhelming passion for both the mission of Lubbock Christian University and the rare and priceless experience that it creates for all those students and faculty members who get to be a part of it," said Bumstead. "Work in business was never meant to be something seen as separate from the practice of our faith. At LCU, we are intensely driven toward preparing leaders who will live out a calling to serve others in the world of business, operating from the understanding that doing business God's way is very, very good business."
   
 Bumstead is an active member of the Lubbock community and is best known for his distinguished career with United Supermarkets, having served as co- president for nine years and on their board 17 years. He has also served in numerous leadership roles in organizations including Lubbock Area United Way, Lubbock Chamber of Commerce, the Texas Methodist Foundation and Lubbock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association.
   
 LCU President Dr. Scott McDowell said, "I am absolutely thrilled that Matt Bumstead has agreed to embrace this responsibility and expand his influence here at Lubbock Christian University. Even in my short time in Lubbock, I have been so impressed by Matt's keen professional insights and his incredible ability to naturally and genuinely engage students, drawing the very best out of each one of them. Everyone who knows Matt Bumstead knows that he is the right person to lead this college to even higher levels of excellence."
   
 Bumstead's diverse experience and leadership of one of Lubbock's most prominent, successful, and community-oriented businesses uniquely prepares him to lead the LCU School of Business, the largest undergraduate program in the university.
   
 Bumstead is replacing Mack, who is retiring after serving as dean of the business school for the past five years. Mack had been a member of the business school faculty for 20 years before his tenure as dean. The Tracy Mack Legacy Endowed Scholarship has been set up to honor Mack and to benefit business students.

It’s three primary focuses of keeping people who are sick or potentially sick out of the plant; maintaining an environment; and then if someone is asymptomatic and is in the plant, a very targeted way to clean and do contact tracing to limit the exposure. And over the last several weeks, we’ve been able to demonstrate that’s been quite successful. And so we think with those protocols and communicating and sharing our plans, we’re in a good position as we talk to country leaders and state leaders. So the conversation has been constructive, and that’s what informs our current plan on 5/18. Obviously, we’ll continue to have dialogue with our unions as well as with the government leaders to do the right thing.

Mnuchin told reporters, “interest rates are incredibly low, so there’s very little cost of borrowing this money.”
 But this rationale is false, Chris Edwards, an economist at the Cato Institute, told The Center Square. “Mnuchin seems to have forgotten about loan principal. Every dollar borrowed causes damage down the road from the resulting higher taxes extracted from the private sector,” he says. “Furthermore, interest rates may spike, which will increase federal borrowing costs as accumulated debt is rolled over.”
 The spending and tax cuts allocated by the CARES Act, and the Families First relief bill, will increase debt by $1.76 trillion, and $192 billion, respectively, according to CBO projections. The small business relief act added $480 billion to the total.
 In total, spending increases and tax cuts in coronavirus legislation may increase debt initially to roughly $2.4 trillion. Edwards estimates that the effect of recession will reduce federal revenues a further $2.2 trillion over the next few years. With higher spending and lower revenues, federal borrowing costs are expected to be approximately $1.2 trillion higher over the next decade.
 The basic CBO estimates exclude these costs, Edwards notes. All told, these decisions will add an estimated $5.8 trillion to the national debt.
 The deficit will soar to nearly $4 trillion in 2020, then narrow to roughly $1.5 trillion for the next few years, before it is expected to widen again, Edwards says.
 Between 2019 and 2030, the federal government may add $20 trillion in new debt, according to Edwards’ projections. Under the pre-coronavirus CBO baseline, federal debt held by the public had been expected to rise from $16.8 trillion in 2019 to $31.3 trillion by 2030, or 79 percent of GDP to 98 percent. According to Edwards’ calculation, debt will rise to $37.2 trillion by 2030 or 116 percent of GDP.

"I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon," he said.
 Trump had said he would don a face mask if the factory was "a mask environment," but in the end he wore only safety goggles during a tour of the Honeywell facility. Nearly all factory workers and members of the press as well as some White House staff and Secret Service agents wore masks. Senior White House staff and Honeywell executives did not.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks when they can't socially distance, such as in supermarkets, especially in places with high transmission rates. In the area where Trump spoke, a large video monitor listed safety guidelines, one of which said, "Please wear your mask at all times."
 Vice President Mike Pence created a stir recently when photos showed him maskless in a visit to the Mayo Clinic surrounded by hospital officials and doctors all wearing masks. He said that he hadn't known it was a requirement and that he is tested for the virus frequently. He wore a mask at an event a few days later.
 The president spent about three hours in Phoenix, touring the Honeywell factory and holding a roundtable on Native American issues. Aides said the trip would be worth the nearly eight hours of flight time as a symbolic show that the nation is taking steps back to normalcy. The trip was also expected to be a marker of Trump's return to a regular travel schedule, as he hopes the nation, too, will begin to emerge from seven weeks of virus-imposed isolation.
 Trump sees economic revival as a political imperative, as his allies have noted an erosion in support for the president in recent weeks. Republicans believe Trump's path to a second term depends on the public's perception of how quickly the economy rebounds from shutdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus.
 The White House had begun discussions about winding down its coronavirus task force, which has already been meeting less frequently, Pence said Tuesday. Its members have become fixtures on television sets across the nation, with Americans hungry for information and marooned at home.
 "I think we're having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the task force to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency by agency level," Pence said at the White House. He said the group could wind down its work by early June.
 Asked about his statements in February playing down the threat of the virus, Trump told ABC in an interview that medical experts also had underestimated the risk and added: "I want to be optimistic. I don't want to be Mr. Doom and Gloom. It's a very bad subject. I'm not looking to tell the American people when nobody really knows what is happening yet, 'Oh this is going to be so tragic.'"

The additional stimulus spending and coronavirus-caused recession may impose nearly $6 trillion of costs on future taxpayers, Edwards estimates.
 Debt increases as federal revenue declines. During the Great Recession, revenues fell 18 percent between 2007 and 2009 and took five years to recover to the level it was before. If revenues fall by 18 percent in 2020 due to the recession, and then recover and regain the CBO baseline level by 2025, Edwards projects that federal revenue losses will be roughly $2.2 trillion.
 “The current crisis shows how the government should have paid down the debt during the decade long economic boom and the added debt from the crisis would be easier to handle,” Edwards told The Center Square.
 “Once the crisis is over and economy starts growing, policymakers should focus on restraint across the board and aim to balance the budget in say 5 or 10 years.”
 Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, who co-wrote a history of financial collapses in 2009, and has warned about the risks of escalating national debt, agrees with Edwards on the government’s role of paying down the debt.
 "We are in a war," Rogoff told CBS MoneyWatch in March when the first stimulus bill passed. "The whole point of not relying on debt excessively in normal times is precisely to be able to use debt massively and without hesitation in situations like this."
 To understand the process, Rogoff explains that the U.S. Treasury Department isn’t actually printing an additional $2 trillion in dollar bills to pay for these programs. Instead, it borrows the money from investors by selling U.S. government bonds.
 “The challenge comes when that $2 trillion Treasury bond sale siphons money away from other essential lending markets, including blue-chip corporate bonds — that makes it more expensive for all kinds of companies and local governments to borrow,” Rogoff adds.
 According to CNN business analyst, Charles Riley, “Financial markets should easily absorb this new wave of debt, especially because central banks have committed to buying huge amounts of government bonds as part of their own stimulus efforts.”
 Riley adds that, “economists aren't worried about the short-term effects of this massive splurge. The prospect of rising inflation caused by waves of stimulus, for example, isn't much of a concern because consumer demand is likely to remain subdued during the recession, even when lockdowns are eased or lifted.”

New Delhi: The print media industry has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 4500 crore during the months of March and April, the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) said on Wednesday, seeking a relief and stimulus package for the sector that employees three million people directly or indirectly.
 In a statement released on Wednesday, Shailesh Gupta, President of the INS said the body has requested the Centre for a stimulus package and also sought the support of all state governments and public sector firms , as well as the Bureau of Outreach and Communication (BOC) to take immediate steps to release the dues (for advertising by government and government departments) payable up to April.
 "Newspapers are facing the most turbulent and difficult period of all times. This industry directly and indirectly gives employment to 3 million people. However, against all odds and in spite of the increasing costs with no returns, all necessary steps are taken to ensure that the newspaper reaches every morning to its readers in every nook and corner of the country regularly," Gupta said.
 The INS president on behalf of its members, expressed his gratitude and appreciated the efforts of the Chief Minister of Gujarat Vijay Rupani who has promised to clear all the pending payments arising from government advertising till April.
 "This move will provide much needed respite to the print media industry, which has lost nearly 4500 Crores during March and April," the INS statement said.
 We look forward to a similar approach from Prime Minister Modi, as over the past few weeks INS has requested the Union Government for a stimulus package, the statement added.

 "We will be contacting individuals later today regarding their interest in participating on that task force," he said.
 Also during Wednesday's briefing:
 — Justice said WorkForce West Virginia has received more than 170,000 claims for unemployment benefits since March 1.
 Over 15%, or more than 25,500, of these claims will require "special handling" in order to be processed, Justice said.
 "I have directed (Acting WorkForce Commissioner) Scott Adkins to get these done as quickly as possible, and if he needs additional help all he's got do is ask me for it," he said.
 — Justice speculated about when state government workers who have been working from home will be able to return to their offices, saying this is likely "a few weeks out."

EA declined to comment on the comment, but the meaning seems obvious enough. It likely refers to "cross-gen" games that will appear on both existing consoles and those set to debut later in the year. If you buy the next, say, "Battlefield" game on PlayStation 4, you will have the option to transfer it somehow to the PlayStation 5.

Till the pandemic struck, the $790-billion Indian retail sector was slated to double in size over the next five years on the back of rising consumption and increasing formalization. Instead, it finds itself hamstrung even as people now need supplies most urgently. Even e-commerce, which could have taken some of the load off physical retail, has collapsed in the face of logistical hurdles. While it has a mere 3% share of the total market, its scorching growth rate at 30% did suggest that in a crisis, it had the tools to supplement offline trade.

A hefty chunk of money could be raised through such a device. Since banks are flush with funds these days, they may be keen to join RBI in this exercise. However, to keep the complexity of it minimal and its terms favourable to the stimulus cause, it should be restricted to RBI and the government. This would allow it to be structured as a repurchase agreement, instead of a regular loan transaction—which would have added to the Centre’s official debt burden, and perhaps exposed our sovereign credit rating to the risk of a downgrade. Since it would be a “repo" deal of the kind RBI routinely runs, the interest rate on the money loaned this way would be very low, too. In general, collateralized lending by the central bank to the government could avoid many of the pitfalls of other financing options.

Transgender people have appealed to the government to institute a monthly basic income, ensure access to ration and essentials and supply of medication to help the marginalised community during the Covid-19 pandemic. In a letter to the finance, home and social justice ministries, more than 2,000 activists and groups said the community was hit hard by the ongoing national lockdown because it obliterated their primary sources of income -- begging and sex work - and the lack of proper identity cards stopped their access to social security schemes."This community is already very badly affected and further marginsalised during a pandemic, and prone to higher health risks. It is important that the central government provide adequate support, which must include ration," said Meera Sanghamitra, an activist and one of the signatories to the letter. The activists noted that some measures had been instituted to help the community - such as the provision of Rs 1,500 by the National Institute of Social Defense (NISD) -- but added that such efforts were mostly localized and inadequate. For example, the NISD allowance reached around 4,500 people, according to the activists, which made up roughly 1% of the 488,000-odd transpeople counted in the 2011 Census. The activists demanded that the government provide a subsistence income of at least Rs. 3,000 per month, universalize the public distribution system to ensure food security, block the eviction or forced rent payment of transpeople, and ensure uninterrupted supply of essential medication. "This would also be in keeping with the spirit of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in NALSA vs UoI (14th April, 2014) and obligations of the state, there under as well as under Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India," the letter added, referring to the 2014 verdict of the top court that affirmed the rights of the trans community and recognised them as "third gender".

MIAMI (AP) — A former Green Beret who has claimed responsibility for an ill-fated military incursion into Venezuela is under federal investigation for arms trafficking, according to current and former U.S. law enforcement officials.The investigation into Jordan Goudreau is in its initial stages and it's unclear if it will result in charges, according to a U.S. law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The probe stems from a frenzy of contradictory comments Goudreau has made since a small cadre of volunteer combatants he was advising on Sunday launched an impossible raid aimed at overthrowing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.Members of the U.S. Congress are also asking the State Department about its knowledge of Goudreau's plans and raised concerns that he possibly violated arms trafficking rules.An AP investigation published prior to the failed raid places Goudreau at the center of a plot hatched with a rebellious former Venezuelan Army Gen., Cliver Alcalá, to secretly train dozens of Venezuelan military deserters in secret camps in Colombia to carry out a swift operation against Maduro. The U.S. has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest or conviction. He was indicted by the Trump administration in March on narcoterrorist charges .The men were being readied for combat at three rudimentary camps in Colombia with the help of Goudreau and his Florida-based company, Silvercorp USA, multiple Maduro opponents and aspiring freedom fighters told the AP. But the plot seemed doomed from the start because it lacked the support of the Trump administration and was infiltrated by Maduro's vast, Cuban-trained intelligence network, the AP found.The law enforcement official said Goudreau’s comments suggests his work on behalf of the volunteer army may have violated laws that require any U.S. company supplying weapons or military equipment, as well as military training and advice, to foreign persons to seek State Department approval.Experts agree.“Goudreau’s public comments alone show he was exporting his lethal expertise into a foreign country," said Sean McFate, a former U.S. Army paratrooper who worked as a private military contractor and is the author of a book, “The New Rules of War,” on the foreign policy implications of privatized warfare. “This is a serious violation.”Goudreau declined to comment on Tuesday. The State Department said it is restricted under law from confirming licensing activities.The law enforcement official said Goudreau's possible involvement in weapons smuggling stems from the March 23 seizure by police in Colombia of a stockpile of weapons being transported in a truck. Alcalá claimed ownership of the cache shortly before surrendering to face U.S. narcotics charges in the same case for which Maduro was indicted.The stockpile, worth around $150,000, included spotting scopes, night vision goggles, two-way radios and 26 American-made assault rifles with the serial numbers rubbed off. Fifteen brown-colored helmets seized by police were manufactured by High-End Defense Solutions, a Miami-based military equipment vendor owned by a Venezuelan immigrant family, according to Colombian police.High-End Defense Solutions is the same company that Goudreau visited in November and December, allegedly to source weapons, according to two former Venezuelan soldiers who claim to have helped the American select the gear but later had a bitter falling out with Goudreau amid accusations that they were moles for Maduro. The AP could not independent verify their account.Company owner Mark Von Reitzenstein has not responded to repeated email and phone requests seeking comment.Two former law enforcement officials said an informant approached the Drug Enforcement Administration in Colombia prior to the weapons' seizure with an unsubstantiated tip about Goudreau’s alleged involvement in weapons smuggling. The anti-narcotics agency, not knowing who Goudreau was at the time, didn’t open a formal probe but suspected that any weapons would’ve been destined for leftist rebels or criminal gangs in Colombia — not a ragtag army of Venezuelan volunteers, the former officials said on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. One of the officials said the information was later passed on to the Department of Homeland Security.The DEA said it does not comment on ongoing potential investigations.Authorities in Colombia are also looking into Goudreau as part of their investigation into the seized weapons shipment, a Colombian official told the AP on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing case.Meanwhile, officials in U.S. Congress are expressing concern. Democratic congressional staff contacted the State Department multiple times on Monday seeking information about any possible contacts with Goudreau or knowledge of his activities, and whether his work may have violated International Traffic in Arms Regulations, according to a staffer on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private outreach.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday reiterated President Donald Trump's claims a day earlier that there was no direct U.S. government involvement in Goudreau's brazen operation.“If we’d have been involved, it would have gone differently," he joked. "As for who bankrolled it, we’re not prepared to share any more information about what we know took place. We’ll unpack that at an appropriate time, we’ll share that information if it makes good sense.”Goudreau, a three- time Bronze Star recipient, has insisted that his work providing only strategic advice to the combatants doesn't require special licensing. Still, he acknowledged sending into battle two special forces buddies associated with Silvercorp and who are now in Venezuelan custody after the plot was foiled.“You’ve got to introduce a catalyst,” he said in a phone interview with the AP on Monday from Florida. “By no means am I saying that 60 guys can come in and topple a regime. I’m saying 60 guys can go in and inspire the military and police to flip and join in the liberation of their country, which deep down is what they want.”Goudreau has said he was hired by Juan Guaidó, who the U.S. and some 60 nations recognize as Venezuela’s rightful leader. To back his claim, he's produced an 8-page agreement he signed with what appears to be the signature of Guaidó. The opposition leader has refused to say whether the signature is authentic but has insisted he has no relationship with Silvercorp.“The dictatorship insists on lying,” Guaidó said Tuesday in a virtual session of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, over which he presides. “The interim government has nothing to do with this operation.”Contradictions abound in Goudreau's account as well. In a televised interview with a Venezuelan journalist exiled in Miami he claims he never received a “single cent” for his work yet continued to prepare the men for battle, in the process going deep into debt. JJ Rendon, a Miami-based adviser to Guaidó, said that he gave Goudreau $50,000 as requested to cover some expenses. Goudreau acknowledged the payment to the AP.A person familiar with the situation said the agreement was signed by Rendon and another U.S.-based aide to Guaidó, lawmaker Sergio Vergara, in October. Guaidó at one point briefly greeted Goudreau via video conference — as evidenced by an audio recording made on a hidden cellphone by Goudreau and which he shared with the Venezuelan journalist.“Let's get to work!” said a voice that appears to be Guaidó in the leaked recording. He makes no mention of any military incursion.A few days later, the team cut off contact with Goudreau, realizing he was unable to deliver what he had promised and because they were not getting along, the person said. An attempt to reactivate the accord fell through in November because the opposition has abandoned support for a private military incursion, the person said. The last contact with Goudreau was a few weeks ago when a lawyer on the veteran's behalf wrote Rendon seeking to collect a promised $1.5 million retainer. Goudreau, through intermediaries, made it known that if they didn't pay up he would release the agreement to the press, the person said.It's unclear how the weapons were smuggled into Colombia. But Silvercorp in December bought a 41-foot fiberglass boat, Florida vessel registration records show, and proceeded in February to obtain a license to install maritime navigation equipment. On his application to the Federal Communications Commission, he said the boat, named Silverpoint and with a capacity for 10 passengers, would travel to foreign ports.The boat next appeared in Jamaica, where Goudreau had gathered with a few of his special forces buddies looking to participate in the raid, according to a person familiar with the situation on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive dealings.But as they were readying their assault, the boat broke down at sea on March 28 and an emergency position-indicating radio beacon was activated, alerting naval authorities on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao. Goudreau had to return to Florida, prevented from rejoining his troops prior to the landing because of travel restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic.“He would have 100% gone out in a blaze of gunfire because that’s who he is,” said the person.—-AP Writer Scott Smith in Caracas, Venezuela, Matthew Lee in Washington and investigative researcher Randy Herschaft in New York contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.
