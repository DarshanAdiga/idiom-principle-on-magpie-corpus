The Senate amended the bill to make the expanded coverage subject to the availability of funding for the initiative, a key consideration in light of the state’s current budget woes.
 House Bill 987 increases training requirements for staff members in elderly care facilities and raises the number of staff who would have to be on site at any given time to watch over residents. It would also increase fines for violations or if a facility causes a resident’s death.
 When the bill reached the Senate, it was amended to require elderly care homes to report when residents or staff members have tested positive for COVID-19. Senators also set out specific cleaning procedures and put in a provision requiring facilities to keep on hand at least a seven-day supply of protective equipment including masks and gowns.
 “We’re going to be a leader in this country on taking care of our elderly in assisted-living facilities,” said House Health and Human Services Committee Chairman Sharon Cooper, R-Marietta, who sponsored both bills.
 Both measures now head to Gov. Brian Kemp’s desk for his signature.

 During the last calving season, the number of new births was 81. The number in 2018 was 75 and in 2017, it was 87.
 ## Total number at 726
 The total number of Nilgiri tahrs now rose to 726, said Eravikulam range officer Job J. Neriyamparambil.
 He said the changes, though in a minor level, might have caused a high birth rate.
 The five-day survey was held from April 20 to 24.
 Usually the census is conducted by a team comprising non-governmental organisations and officials of the Forest Department.
 However, only Forest Department officials took part in this year’s survey owing to the lockdown.
