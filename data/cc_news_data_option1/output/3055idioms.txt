Officially India's death rate is nearly 20 times lower than the U.S., even though it has the world's fastest growing epidemic and the third highest number of total cases -- now including Shah, who confirmed on Sunday that he was hospitalized with the virus. But independent experts are warning India has failed to properly record fatalities, and say better data collection is needed if the country is going to get a handle on the epidemic.

When we last saw Beth, she had just shot Rio as he was beating up Agent Turner. Now that he's out of the picture, she's ready to run the game and stay in control. The women take on seemingly innocent jobs - Beth in a stationary store, Ruby in a nail salon and Annie as a valet - each with a special purpose to aid them in their new criminal enterprise. What happens as they expand their operation will have a ripple effect with their families. Meanwhile, Stan's taken a job in security at a strip club and Dean is working sales at a spa company. From Executive Producer Jenna Bans ("Grey's Anatomy," "Scandal") comes the third season of this comedy-infused drama that mixes a little "Thelma & Louise" with a bit of "Breaking Bad." The cast includes Christina Hendricks, Retta, Mae Whitman, Reno Wilson, Manny Montana, Lidya Jewett, Isaiah Stannard and Matthew Lillard

Families who wish to use a full distance-learning model instead will still have that opportunity, he said. Those families will be asked to register following the board's Aug. 13 meeting.
 The announcement comes nearly two weeks after the Stonington Board of Education approved sending a multi-level plan to the state that included two full-return models, two hybrid models and a full distance-learning model. Members of the Board of Education had initially endorsed a full-return model that would put students back in their classrooms with 3 feet of distance between them.
 The preferred plan, which has been dubbed Plan 2, was endorsed on July 21 and included a full reopening that would fully utilize the district's facilities and staff while providing needed in-person instruction and social stimulation for students.
 But Riley noted at the July meeting that 43 teachers have said they will not or cannot come back to teach, and over 250 families said in an early summer survey they did not want to send their children back to school until the coronavirus pandemic had subsided.

Peter Bromiley Okatie, SC - Peter Bromiley, 92, passed away peacefully in Coastal Carolina Hospital on July 19, 2020, He was born in Wanganui, New Zealand in 1928, the son of Norman and Muta Bromiley. In addition to his parents he was predeceased by his sister, Margaret Lupton and his brother Murray Bromiley. He was the oldest of the 3 siblings. Peter was a self made man, but did train for a time at Wanganui Technical College in NZ where he studied Marine Engineering. Surviving in addition to his wife of 35 years, Gail (Podeszwa) Bromiley, are his 2 daughters, Vicki Baldocci (Marcello Baldocci), Debra Bromiley (Ed Hunt), 2 sons, Clifford Bromiley (Beth Powell), Dean Bromiley (Alka Bromiley), 5 Bromiley grand children, Matthew, Maddie, Will, Georgie, and Alice and 3 Bromiley great grand children, Sofia, Penelope, Maxine. Peter lived his life like an adventure out of the Indiana Jones series. Having been born and raised in New Zealand, I guess it comes with the territory. If ever there was a person who lived larger than life it was Peter. He started his life as a fisherman in the pristine waters of New Zealand. Earned his NZ pilot's license in a biplane as a teen, his scuba certificate in his seventies while in the Bahamas, RVing to Alaska while in his eighties. In his later life his home workshop was his sanctuary, he was probably on a first name basis with most of the hardware vendors in Beaufort County. His world wide entrepreneurial pursuits, included but was not limited to areas in Africa, Middle East, Europe, Central America and the U.S. where he organized and implemented a variety of construction projects, working together with Middle Eastern sheiks, African hierarchy, NZ prime ministers and the US government, where the challenges were never ending. Lest we not forget his mariner feats on the high seas in his beloved Alden Off Shore 50 sailing yacht as assistance vessel for the transpac yacht race from San Francisco to Hawaii, his off shore trips up the Pacific Coast to Alaska, oyster fishing with his nephews in the San Juan Islands, and crossing the Gulf Stream from SC to the Bahamas. As he stated multiple times in the weeks preceding his passing, "I've had a good run"......... That you did Peter Stewart Bromiley. Peter wished to be cremated and have his ashes scattered in New Zealand. We will have a celebration of his life in Okatie, SC once the Pandemic is under control. No flowers please.

Robbie Berg, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, told the Associated Press, “Now that the center has moved further inland into east North Carolina, the winds are now coming back down, so it has been downgraded back to a tropical storm." Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith told WECT-TV that the storm set off flooding and sparked five home fires.

Like any other responsible car maker, Porsche extensively tested each of its new models in real-world conditions to check its capabilities, ascertain areas for possible improvements and gauge potential fault lines, if any. The real world, however, has changed significantly over the course of past several months and while testing vehicles remains every bit as crucial for Porsche, it has changed a whole lot of processes and brought in new parameters.
 For starters, sanitizers, masks and gloves are more important than all else to ensure the safety of test drivers, engineers and all others involved with the testing process. Each unit is test driven by two engineers - each individually, which means the car needs to undergo a rigorous sanitization process when being swapped. And no high fives like before, of course.
 Porsche says that its engineers swap cars every 45 minutes and this is crucial to test the car thoroughly in a wide variety of conditions and yet in a timely manner. But unlike before when Porsche cars were tested in varying climatic conditions, these are now doing the rounds in home conditions - Weissach and in the Black Forest. "The crisis forces us to be more flexible," says Marcel Honemann, head of testing at Porsche. "We are now test driving cars more on home turf."

Olivia Lee Holt Olivia Lee Holt, 76, of Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, wife of the late John William Holt, entered into eternal rest Thursday, July 30, 2020. This world could no longer contain her endless capacity for joy, kindness, and love. Olivia, best known as "Libby" or "Mimi", was born August 15, 1943 in Shelby, North Carolina, one of the ten children of the late Richard Coker and the late Dovey Williams Coker. While raising her two wonderful children, she had a successful career as a hairdresser giving not only perms but life advice to all of her clients. Then she was called to use her caretaking gifts as a dedicated, live-in nanny for 18 years in Hilton Head until her charge went to Harvard. While in Hilton Head she spent her time with many friends, enjoying live music, time at the beach and laughter. Following her retirement, she moved to Mount Pleasant to be with family, and spent her time traveling to see her loved ones ensuring she never missed a pageant, performance, or game of any of her grandchildren. Olivia loved without boundaries, prioritizing faith, family and friends. She walked through life in a song, never afraid to burst into song and dance. Olivia never met a stranger, willing to help and care for anyone she met. Something Mimi always said that undoubtfully generated laughter was, "I like bread and butter & you like toast and jam!"; So, here's to loving people whether they like bread and butter or toast and jam. She is survived by her daughter, Angelia Holt Grech (Joe) of Mount Pleasant, SC; her son, John William Holt (Kisha) of Gray Court, SC; six grandchildren, Stetson Lee Holt, Elizabeth Rose Grech, Emma Katherine Grech, Justus Wyatt Holt, Joseph Henry Grech, and Piper Grace Holt; two great-grandchildren, Naomi Grace Holt and Lucas Oliver Holt; her sister, Loretta Revis of Orange Beach, AL; and her brother, Harold Coker of Rome, GA. Over the next week please quietly do something kind for another person in loving memory of Libby and the legacy of kindness.

CARVER - The owner of the proposed sending area and the receiving area are one and the same for a proposed transfer of development rights project in Carver.
 Bristol Brothers and Weathervane Properties own both properties on South Meadow Road and Silva Street, as presented to the Planning Board Tuesday night. The project would transfer nine affordable units from South Meadow to Silva Street. Both are age-restricted 55 and older housing developments.
 Loring Tripp, a planner with Weathervane Properties and former Plymouth Planning Board chairman, said the South Meadow project under construction is a maximum 60-unit development on 30 acres, including a former bog that would be restored to its natural state with walking trails.
 He said their intention is to start small and demonstrate how TDRs can benefit the town as well as the developer and then look to move forward with bigger projects in the future.
 "We want to be here in Carver for the long haul," he said. "We want to be partners here in Carver with a good quality development, creating a lot of jobs and creating really nice homes. This is our first step in the door, and we want to do it right."
 Jim Bristol, president of Bristol Brothers and the Weathervane Companies, said the 21 cottage-style detached homes they plan to build off Silva Street will include a maximum of two-bedroom units with a garage and will be Title 5 septic approved based on 150 gallons a day.
 He said they want to be a good neighbor.
 "We go into a community with every development trying to increase the value of all the properties around us," he said. "That's good for us; it's good for you. Our mission, no matter where we go, is to go in and pick up the value of the area."
 Bristol said the developments they have built consistently increase the value of properties in that area.
 "You look at any development that we've done; we're all over the South Shore, everything we've built, when we get done the values around us go up," he said.
 Planning Board member Bruce Maki said there's a long way to go but took multiple questions from residents that were answered by the applicant.
 Several residents voiced concern about the impact on Silva Street. Bristol said the development there was originally going to be bigger but the idea behind making it smaller on Silver was to be able to use the TDR credits for a future development closer to Route 44 in a denser part of town.
 Silva Street residents questioned the potential impact on their wells and the pond in the area. The entrance to the 21-home development would be off the property they own. Bristol said they would rectify any problems with nearby wells, while Tripp addressed questions about the pond.
 Tripp said a landscaped pond area would be created, so they would expect any animals that live around the existing pond will migrate over to the other pond they created. He said they have already confirmed that no rare or endangered species have been identified.
 South Meadow Village resident Donna Forand asked if they would consider building a Council on Aging center for the town.
 Tripp said they are looking at a long-term relationship with future land use sites and are willing to engage in conversation in that type of idea.
 Planning Director Jim Walsh said his next steps will be to clarify the town's next steps with the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District and review those next steps with the Planning Board.
 Tripp said they are ready to file preliminary plans, and while SRPEDD cautioned the board about the need for new maps identifying sending and receiving areas, the bylaw essentially identifies both areas in town.
 Planning Board member Kevin Robinson said he appreciates that they are not trying to sneak in through the back door and are open about their plans.
