Thankfully, the EU seems finally to be receiving diminishing returns from their relentless appeal to this manifest falsehood. The legal process on which they have just embarked against the U.K. would take years to reach resolution. Happily, the United Kingdom will have completely extricated itself from the legal order of the EU (including the jurisdiction of ECJ) by the end of this year. The threats issued this week are purely political in nature, made in the full knowledge by all parties that they cannot be carried out. I suppose that the purpose of all this bluster from the European perspective is to show the British that they “mean business,” but all it really demonstrates is how out of practice they are when it comes to treating countries on their own continent as diplomatic equals. The time is fast approaching when the EU will no longer be able to threaten and bully the U.K. into line with the prospect of sanctions legal action from within its own technocratic apparatus. These “legal actions” really amount to no more than a final, impotent temper tantrum thrown by the Commission in response to the approaching, ineluctable advent of British independence.

Three journalists tested positive on Friday after spending time over the weekend at the White House or traveling with Trump, according to Zeke Miller, an Associated Press reporter and president of the White House Correspondents' Association.
 The Republican National Committee would chose a replacement nominee if Trump were to become incapacitated, but it is already too late in most states to change the names on the ballot. Some 2.9 million people have already voted, according to figures compiled by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.
 The virus could also complicate Trump's push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.
 At least two people who were at a White House event to announce her nomination, University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins and Republican Senator Mike Lee, said Friday they have tested positive.
 Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter.
 Trump is the latest world leader to contract the virus, which can cause a severe respiratory infection.
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care after falling gravely ill in March. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called the virus a "little flu" after being infected in July. Both men recovered.

Priyanka Chopra was "very productive" during the Covid-19 lockdown as she finally finished work on her memoir Unfinished.
 The Baywatch actress first began working on the project two years ago after discussions with publisher Penguin Random House, but her hectic schedule soon got in the way, and she only finally finished work on the book in the past few months.
 "It seems like the right time to introspect on my life, that was my reason for writing the book," she said to People. "And I think I cursed it when I called it Unfinished, because it took me two years to finish it!"
 Priyanka, who is married to Jonas Brothers star Nick Jonas, enjoyed working on the forthcoming release outside at the couple's Los Angeles home "after my workout when it's quiet, and Nick's busy doing his thing".
 "There's literally every year of my life in this book, which is why I'm so nervous," she explained, revealing she spoke to her mum, teachers from her childhood, and key people from her early career days to help inform the personal story.
 "I've had to push against the norm a lot through my whole life, and I discuss that in-depth," added The Sky Is Pink actress. "I call this the in-between interviews book. Everything I talked about in my interviews is public knowledge, but what happens when I go back into my trailer, or when I go home at night? I might share great moments of my personal life, but I've always had walls up and been very private, and I open up in my book... This book helped drop the curtain and share my vulnerabilities."
 Unfinished is due to be released on 19 January.

Dominic West leapt in the air with "joy" when he found out U.S. President Donald Trump had contracted Covid-19.
 It was announced that Trump had caught the virus, which he has consistently played down as a threat, despite more than 200,000 Americans dying, in the early hours of the morning in the U.K. on Friday.
 Asked on TV show Good Morning Britain if he had an "instinctive reaction" to the news, The Wire actor confessed he "did slightly leap in the air with joy" after hearing of Trump's positive Covid-19 test.
 Explaining why he has no sympathy for Trump, he added: "He said it is what it is, and I think the phrase is what goes around comes around. I just hope it doesn't interfere with him being elected out of office, that's all.
 "There's an element of schadenfreude in all this, I suppose. I'm not a fan of his, as you can probably tell, I just hope (Joe) Biden stays healthy and gets the presidency as quickly a possible. I think Trump is a catastrophe for America and the world."
 It was announced that Trump and his wife Melania has tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday morning, shortly after Hope Hicks, one of his top aides, tested positive. The Trumps are said to be doing well and are self-isolating at the White House while they recover.
 The U.S. public will decide between Trump and his Democrat rival Biden on 3 November.
