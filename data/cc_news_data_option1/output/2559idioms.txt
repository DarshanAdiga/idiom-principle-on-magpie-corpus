The hit KAN drama Tehran features espionage and reveals everyday challenges Iranian citizens face. It also presents a cast that has built ties between two cultures and nations that have been long-time enemies.


  In a recent phone interview, director Daniel Syrkin and Iranian-American actor Shaun Toub shared their thoughts about the series and building bridges between Iranians and Israelis.


  Titled after Iran's capital, Tehran revolves around Tamar Rabinyan, a young Mossad agent, played by Israeli actress Niv Sultan, who travels undercover to Iran, also the character's birthplace, to disable a nuclear reactor. In Tehran, Rabinyan is tasked with interacting with Iranian locals who help her rediscover her roots and confront her true enemy.


  "We really wanted to show how this young Mossad agent learns about her culture again and about loyalty, patience and country," said the Israeli Syrkin who also directed the popular Netflix show Mossad 101.


  The Israel-Iran conflict has lasted for decades but that didn't stop cast members from forming friendships. "I think in the beginning both sides were cautious of each other," said Syrkin. "Israelis were cautious of Iranians and some Iranians said they thought the shoot was some kind of Mossad scam but we all eventually became really good friends."


  "It's up to Iranians to choose the regime but my hope is that we Israelis will not be in quarrel with them anymore," he added. "Not with the people and not with the regime. My dream is to be able to go to Iran and to feel safe there and not to be afraid of Iran."


  To replicate the streets of Tehran, Syrkin and his team traveled to Athens, Greece, where crew members reconstructed roads, renamed street lamps and signs that resembled the Iranian capital. Syrkin also recruited a number of Iranians to serve as extras in the show, he found living in refugee camps in Athens.


  "I met some amazing people," said Syrkin. "A guy who was an engineer, college graduates and people who had different jobs in Iran and were now unemployed and waiting months to receive their status to go live elsewhere." The international cast donated food and blankets to the refugees after the production ended, mentioned Syrkin.


  Iranian-American Actor Shaun Toub, who plays security officer Faraz Mehmet, also relayed his views about interacting with the refugees and how he hopes the series will change Iranian's perception of Israel.


  "One of the reasons I accepted this role is because I thought it would be a very interesting series to bring the two cultures together," Toub said. "At the end of the day people are just people and we all have our challenges. It's unfortunate that we allow religion to get in the way of being friends and knowing one's culture."


  Toub also shared his thoughts about the plight of the Iranian refugees he encountered in Athens. "As an Iranian, its really shameful and I don't know why the Iranian government doesn't see that. It's honestly sad, because we are such a rich country and to see refugees all over Europe. It doesn't make sense, but unfortunately we are living in very strange times and it's very heartbreaking."


  TOUB, WHO also is Jewish, has more than 30 years experience acting with 100 episodes and 40 features. He's performed in the 2004 drama Crash, as well as Ironman and Homeland. He described his experience working with Israelis involved in the production.


  "People always say Israelis are so tough and rough and they have to be at times, but I have to tell you on set they couldn't have been nicer, they couldn't have been sweeter... There was just a lot of love, there was never any animosity or bashing it was really lovely, every one was trying to do their best and maybe that's why the series has become such a big hit," Toub said.


   Syrkin, who is of Russian origin, also highlighted what he learned about Iran and its heritage. "I was really surprised by all the similarities between Russian and Iranian culture," he said. "There are parts of the cuisine that are similar but Iranians also honor their own culture which reminded me of Russia. For example, Russians always quote some verses and I found out that almost any Iranian can also do the same from some great Iranian poets. And also, the literacy in Iran, I was just amazed by how many people in Iran also love reading."


  Syrkin believes part of what has drawn Israeli viewers to Tehran, which debuted on June 22 and has been met with critical acclaim, is the lack of knowledge Israelis have about Iran.


  "I think all we know about Iran in Israel is that they are the enemy," Syrkin said. "And after we met so many Iranian people, we understand that maybe the regime is our enemy. I really don't understand why Iran and Israel should be enemies but that is how it is. I think that the people are very similar and need each other. Meeting all those young Iranian actors, coming from all over the world, to me they all look Israeli. I could easily place them in Tel Aviv and they would fit there perfectly."


  In late June, Apple TV+ announced it picked up the series and, according to Toub, has garnered immense attention. Syrkin said he believes that Israeli audiences are hungry for such content.


  "You know we are not out here to educate people, our main goal is to make high quality drama, but if we can make people think and learn something different, that for us, is amazing," he said.

A recent report has revealed that interference in the affairs of customs and revenue departments have resulted in widespread corruption while violation of rules and regulations in appointments in the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has been cited to have caused drastic differences in statistics of export and import of the country. Compiled by the primary anti-graft institution in Afghanistan, the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), the report on corruption vulnerabilities in MoF’s Customs and Revenue Departments came following stinging criticism directed towards the government. Earlier this month, the government was accused of obstructing the release of two important reports on the corruption and irregularities at the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and at the National Procurement Authority (NPA). Also, there were news stories that said the head of the Dispute Resolution Board was appointed illegally, besides some lawmakers claiming that appointments at MoF took place on the bases of back door deals. However, it seems the media discharged its duty after all as one of these obstructed reports has now been released while the other on NPA is expected soon. Thus, the claims regarding corruption at MoF have now been substantiated and its causes revealed by the searing MEC report. The major findings include interferences by powerful individuals, violation of recruitment procedures, wrong statistics of export and import, and lack of awareness on global transit guidelines. These issues should be taken seriously and dealt with accordingly because they have dire repercussions for Afghanistan. For instance, according to MEC, the United Arab Emirates’ trade with Afghanistan is 14 times higher than the statistics reported by the Customs and Revenue Departments. Therefore, the 73 recommendations suggested by MEC to custom offices in areas of legal framework, human resource management, information system, procedures and internal control system should be heeded in order to address corruption vulnerabilities in these areas and remove threats. Moreover, at this juncture, the government should spring into action and prove that it has a strong will to fight corruption and its slogans and calls for reforms aren’t just nominal. Similarly, the new leadership of MoF introduced by President Ashraf Ghani should consider all these vulnerabilities and sincerely work for reforms and end corruption at the ministry once and for all.

US ADP June Employment Change Preview: Positive but a long way to go


--DocBreak--
The precocious kid, who started every game for the varsity basketball team and was a star receiver who caught 10 TD passes for the JV football team, was finally able to have surgery in early June. It was four months after he suffered the injury, a delay that was caused by the coronavirus crisis.


  Leach is now into his rehabilitation process, and is in good spirits.


  "I'm feeling pretty good," Leach said. "I'm through surgery and walking, and I'm starting to do some strengthening stuff. I still have swelling, and they told me I'd have that for a long time.


  "I go to physical therapy two days a week right now, and I do exercises at home to try to stretch it out and steadily strengthen the muscles around my knee."


  It is tough mentally for a two-sport standout to know he's going to be on the sideline for quite some time, but Leach has come to terms with it and pledges to make a big return in both sports.


  "It's pretty tough not being able to do much of anything," he said. "I went to see my AAU team play last weekend and that was hard having to sit there and not be able to play, but it was great seeing everybody and just be around it.


  "I know I'll miss all of football and I won't be back until January for basketball. I don't like it, but it's how it is. I love football just as much as basketball, and I will play both when I come back.


  "I believe I'll come back stronger than before in both because I'll be forced to lift with that leg and I'll get stronger."


  There's absolutely no reason to doubt the kid. Leach showed his toughness shortly after suffering his injury. First off, he returned to the floor in that sectional setback to Jennings County before finally having to exit for good.


  But more incredibly, he snuck out and played some hoops before he ever went under the scope for repairs. The COVID-19 situation forced him to have to wait and excruciatingly long time for surgery, and his patience wore thinner than his damaged ACL.


  "I was playing pick-up basketball on Fridays not too long after my injury," he revealed. "My leg felt normal and I was playing pretty close to normal, maybe not going all-out completely, but playing pretty hard.


  "They were making me wait (for surgery) and I was done with it. I was bored, and I wasn't hurting at all. They said I was in the one percent who don't get pain with this injury, but I did get a couple of small meniscus tears while I was playing pick-up ball. My initial injury was a torn ACL only.


  "But that actually didn't really matter. There wasn't anything I was going to do to make it worse by playing. The recovery time for a torn ACL is 6 to 7 months and the time for a torn meniscus is 2 months.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday said up to $140 billion in possible small business loans could be refocused to support restaurants, hotels and other industries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.


  The remaining funds authorized for the Paycheck Protection Program are due to expire on Tuesday, when the Small Business Administration stops taking applications for the forgivable loans.


  But Mnuchin said it appeared there was support among Democrats and Republicans to "repurpose" the money, perhaps by tailoring it to the types of small businesses most impacted by the social-distancing measures adopted to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus.


  When the PPP was opened broadly to all small businesses "the economy was in very different shape and we needed to get money quickly" to firms, Mnuchin said in a hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.


  "There appears to be bipartisan support to repurpose … extending it to businesses that are most hard hit, that their revenues have dropped significantly, where it is critical to get people back to work," Mnuchin said, with legislation possible next month.


  Mnuchin was testifying along with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about the U.S. fiscal and monetary response to the coronavirus crisis, including the nearly $3 trillion allocated by Congress to help businesses and individuals.


  That response is reaching a critical point, with programs like PPP and enhanced unemployment benefits expiring in July - and perhaps depriving the economy of hundreds of billions of dollars in spending - even as coronavirus infections surge.


  More than 126,000 people in the United States have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and infections more than doubled in at least 10 U.S. states, including Texas and Florida, in June, a Reuters tally showed.


  The U.S. central bank, with Treasury's backing, has launched programs to improve the flow of credit as economic activity cratered and millions of jobs were lost, including its new Main Street Lending Program for mostly medium- sized businesses.


  Treasury has been at the forefront of the $660 billion PPP program aimed at keeping small businesses afloat and their employees on payrolls.


  TO THE HAVES OR HAVE NOTS?


  In prepared testimony released on Monday, Powell noted that the economic recovery had begun sooner than expected, but that output and employment are still far below pre-crisis levels, with the brunt of the pain borne by women and minorities. And a full recovery, he reiterated, is unlikely until people feel safe about going out and about.


  Numerous Fed policymakers, including Powell, have said that more fiscal and monetary help will likely be required to keep what is expected to be a slow and uneven economic recovery on track.


  The Fed has come under fire for a perception that it has prioritized Wall Street over Main Street, helping fuel economic inequality by boosting the price of assets like stocks.


  The central bank has bought trillions of dollars of bonds, and rolled out nearly a dozen programs to backstop and extend corporate credit and promote bank lending, arguing that bracing the economy as a whole is helped when companies maintain access to the financing critical to their operations.


  Data on Sunday showed the Fed bought $428 million in bonds of individual companies through mid-June, making investments in household names like Walmart Inc and AT&T Inc as well as in major oil firms, tobacco giant Philip Morris International Inc, and a utility subsidiary of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holding company.


  At the same time, its Main Street Lending Program has yet to make a loan and has taken three months to come to fruition, though Powell said in his prepared testimony he expected it to be a "valuable resource" in the months ahead. The central bank's programs overall have so far seen modest use.

Israel stands to lose its window of opportunity to annex the West Bank settlements if it doesn't act in the coming weeks, Yesha Council head David Elhayani warned as he urged Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu to hold a cabinet vote on a sovereignty plan this Sunday.


  "For God's sake, what is Netanyahu waiting for?" Elhayani asked in total frustration.


  He spoke with _The Jerusalem Post_ on Tuesday, just one day prior to July 1 - the earliest date by which Netanyahu under the terms of his coalition agreement with the Blue and White party can execute an annexation plan.


  Israel has never actually promised to do so on that date, but as it is the only date that has been provided, global expectation has reached a fevered pitch as the hours tick by to a kind annexation D-Day.


  Netanyahu wants to operate within the contours of US President Donald Trump's peace plan, which allows him, with US approval, to annex up to 30% of the West Bank where settlements are located.


  With one day left to go, the White House has yet to give Israel a green light and expectations are low that any substantive action will occur on Wednesday.


  Settler leaders such as Elhayani want to separate the Trump peace plan from an Israeli sovereignty plan. Netanyahu promised his voters almost a year ago that he would execute a sovereignty plan as soon as he formed a new government, Elhayani said. "It's been several months, and so far nothing has happened," he added.


  Elhayani, who also serves as the Jordan Valley Regional Council head, said he believes that there is only at most a few more weeks before the opportunity for Israeli sovereignty is lost all together.


  As he spoke, he sat behind his desk in his Jordan Valley office and used his hands to pantomime a snowball, which he said represented a combination of international opposition to the plan and the dynamics of the US election cycle.


  "Now, the snowball is very small. But with each day, it will grow bigger and bigger," Elhayani said. At a certain point that snowball of factors will be too formidable to ignore.


  "Netanyahu will do Trump a favor if he moves forward  with sovereignty without waiting for US permission," Elhayani said.


  Such action would make Trump look good with his evangelical voters and would simultaneously allow him to disavow any responsibility should there be a negative backlash among Arab nations or in the Middle East in general.


  Netanyahu should take a page from Trump's playbook, Elhayani said, pointing to Trump's often told story about how he ignored massive objections to the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem because he knew it was the right thing to do. Netanyahu has to do the same thing here, he added.


  But he is among those who hold that just like with the embassy move, the reaction would be minimal. Among the dangers he dismissed was the possibility that Jordan would annual its 1994 peace deal with Israel.


  Such an event is unlikely, according to Elhayani, because Jordan relies too heavily on Israel for security.  

  And even if Jordan were to take that step, the option for sovereignty would be worth it said Elhayani, whose office is so close to Jordan that he can see the country's red hills from his window.


  The blunt-speaking politician who stands easily on his principles said that Netanyahu should not fear pushing back against the US when it comes to sovereignty.


  One could consider that once the United States had recognized the legality of West Bank settlements last November, it had given Israel the green light to annex those Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria, he said.


  "I know of no other way to speak of their legality than to apply Israeli law to them."


  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said multiple times that the timing and location for the application of sovereignty is an Israeli decision, Elhayani said.


  Netanyahu has already run two election campaigns based on sovereignty and it has paid off for him in results, he added.


  Elhayani pointed to a recent poll which showed that Netanyahu's sovereignty pledge had garnered him 10 out of his 36 mandates. Should he fail to keep his word, he would lose those mandates to other parties such as Yamina or Derech Eretz, Elhayani explained.


  In the beginning, Netanyahu did not link sovereignty to US approval, he said. In September, Netanyahu promised Jordan Valley sovereignty immediately upon formation of a new government, Elhayani recalled.


  "But two months have passed and we still don't have sovereignty," Elhayani said.


  At the time, he would have already known about the Trump plan, but he made the pledge anyway, Elhayani said. Linking US approval to sovereignty now, is a form of backtracking on that pledge, he said.


  "I have to ask, has he played us? Did he use the Jordan Valley for his own electoral purposes?" pondered Elhayani, who actively campaigned for Netanyahu after his dramatic announcement.


  "We are calling on Netanyahu to keep his promise. Leaders make good on their promises. It's enough with the excuses."


  "Netanyahu has wide Knesset support, even from the opposition, so why the hesitation, I don't understand it," he said.


  "I expect Netanyahu to bring sovereignty to a vote in the government already this Sunday, otherwise it is a historic opportunity that will be missed," Elhayani said.


  As the head of the Jordan Valley Regional Council, Elhayani has been on the ground floor of the annexation process from the start.


  When talk first surfaced about a real annexation possibility, it was a Jordan Valley first plan.


  The issue began in earnest in June 2019 when Netanyahu visited the area together with former US national security advisor John Bolton, Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Dermer, and US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, Elhayani recalled.


  "Ron whispered to me, 'David you should know you can thank the prime minister, he has watched over the Jordan Valley," Elhayani said.


  So it was clear that something was happening behind the scenes, Elhayani said. In September there was an announcement of the Jordan Valley and Northern Dead Sea sovereignty plan, with a pledge to annex all the settlements later. That was followed by a push in January for an application of sovereignty over all the settlements.


  Netanyahu then held back first for the unveiling of the Trump plan, a week later at the end of January. Then Netanyahu held off again, so that he could have US support following completion of the work of a joint US-Israeli mapping committee tasked with setting the contours of annexation.


  Elhayani was one of four settler leaders who was in Washington for the unveiling of the plan. He is among those who opposed the plan. At issue for him is that he feels it is a blueprint for the creation of a Palestinian state. He also fears the plan would allow for a de facto settlement freeze and would lead to the destruction of at least 15 settlements.


  Elhayani has therefore led a campaign to pressure Netanyahu to apply sovereignty to all the West Bank settlements outside the contours of the Trump peace plan.


  The time is ripe for such an act now, when the international community is distracted by COVID-19 and the US elections are not so far in advance, Elhyahi said.


  While US approval of sovereignty may help Trump now with the Evangelical voters, soon he may focus more on the fear of any negative impact of any backlash from the plan and pressure Israel to defer sovereignty until after the elections, Elhayani said.


  There is of course the obvious, that if Trump loses, his opponent, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden would oppose any Israeli sovereignty plan, Elhayani explained.


  But Elhayani is also concerned that if Trump wins, his primary concern will be the successful execution of the "Deal of the Century" so that he can win a Nobel Peace Prize. In his second term, Trump will not be obligated to anyone and is likely to bring his full weight to pressure Israel into problematic concessions with regard to the plan, he explained.


  "We have to apply sovereignty now, we can't afford to wait even one day," he said.

RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest said Monday his impeding lawsuit against Gov. Roy Cooper for unilaterally closing businesses and mandating face masks due to COVID-19 isn't politically motivated, despite their November election matchup.


   


  Forest, a Republican, said at a news conference the Democratic incumbent has failed to seek or receive support for a half-dozen executive orders since March from the Council of State. That began with a March 17 ban on dine-in restaurant services.


   


  "This lawsuit is not interested in the substance of Gov. Cooper's orders," Forest said at the Legislative Building. "In times of crisis, the rule of law is more important than ever. We must do the right thing in the right way. No one -- governor or citizen -- is above the rule of law."


   


  Cooper and his administration have said he has other authority -- citing several laws -- to act on his own without the council's "concurrence" to protect health and safety. The 10-member council is composed of Cooper, Forest and eight other statewide elected officials. Six council members are Republican.


   


  Forest has been one of Cooper's most vocal critics about his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, in particular issuing statewide directives shuttering business and capping attendance at mass assemblies. The closings have contributed to double-digit unemployment. Some sectors are still closed three months after his first stay-at-home order.


   


  The lawsuit accusing Cooper of violating the state's Emergency Management Act actually hasn't been filed. Forest's office said it will happen as soon as paperwork is finalized allowing him to sue without using the state Attorney General's lawyers. In a letter to Cooper last week laying out his case, Forest wrote there was a conflict of interest because Department of Justice attorneys helped draft the executive orders being challenged.


   


  Other lawsuits filed by business owners challenging Cooper's executive orders as violating the state constitution have been unsuccessful to date. Forest said his lawsuit isn't a political move.


   


  "There's nothing politically expedient about suing the governor," Forest said. "My office motto, my team model, has always been always to do the right thing, no matter what the cost or the consequence."


   


  Still, it gives Forest media attention after Cooper has been routinely on television since the spring at COVID-19 briefings. Cooper's campaign had a massive fundraising advantage over Forest entering 2020.


   


  Cooper campaign spokesperson Liz Doherty called Forest's upcoming litigation a "sham lawsuit" that shows Forest "refuses to put the health and safety of North Carolinians first and simply isn't ready to lead. Partisan politics have no place in pandemic response."


   


  While executive orders in May have allowed many businesses to reopen, Cooper declined last week to ease restrictions further, citing increasing case and hospitalization numbers. Cooper also ordered that people across the state wear masks or other face coverings in public. Forest said a more regional and pinpoint approach is needed to target outbreaks, rather than punish areas of the state where the number of cases are minimal.


   


  North Carolina state health data shows about 63,500 people have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Monday based on over 886,000 completed tests. Well over 800 people testing positive are currently hospitalized, and 1,325 people have died since the pandemic began.


   


  There's been tremendous pressure from businesses and conservative activists upon Republicans to attempt overturn Cooper's current orders. Cooper already has vetoed two bills that would reopen bars and gyms.


   


  Five other bills remaining on the governor's desk reopen bowling alleys, skating rinks and amusements, and even prevent Cooper's outdoor assembly limit of 25 people from canceling local July 4 parades and fireworks. One bill also attempts to make clear a governor must get support from a majority of council members for any statewide emergency of at least 30 days and for closing businesses.

TOULOUSE/PARIS -- Airbus on Tuesday unveiled plans to shed around 15,000 jobs including 900 already earmarked in Germany, saying its future was at stake after the coronavirus pandemic rocked the air travel industry.


  Europe's biggest aerospace group said it would cut some 5,000 posts in France, 5,100 in Germany, 900 in Spain, 1,700 in the UK and 1,300 elsewhere for a core total of 14,000.


  Additionally, the company has already agreed to cut 900 jobs at its Premium AEROTEC unit in Germany.


  The move is subject to talks with unions which immediately renewed pledges to oppose compulsory redundancies. Airbus has refused to rule them out as it seeks voluntary departures, early retirements and long-term partial employment schemes.


  Airbus said it wanted a deal on the job cuts by 2021.


  "It's going to be a mighty battle to save jobs," said Francoise Vallin of the CFE-CGC union.


  A french finance ministry official said the government expected Airbus to use instruments it had made available to reduce job cut numbers.


  On June 3, Reuters reported that Airbus's reduced production targets pointed on paper to cuts of 14,000 full-time posts.


  Earlier on Tuesday, French union sources predicted a headline figure of 15,000 and pledged to fight compulsory cuts.


  Airbus has a 135,000-strong workforce, heavily populated by veterans of its original A320 development. About 37% of staff are due to retire this decade.


  The hardleft Force Ouvriere union and others said they would oppose any mandatory cuts.


  Exceptional secrecy had surrounded the politically sensitive restructuring affecting jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, the company's key backers in a fierce contest with U.S. rival Boeing for orders and industrial clout.


  Airbus is expected to juggle its response to the industry's worst crisis with pressure to keep cuts to a minimum after France and Germany announced plans to support aerospace.


  Michel Pierre, representing the CFDT union at Airbus, said Airbus had refused direct state intervention in its capital, upholding corporate governance reforms in 2013. Compulsory sackings would therefore be "totally unacceptable," he said.


  Industry sources say Airbus is basing the restructuring on a 40% drop in underlying aircraft production for two years.


  The company's programs chief, meanwhile, said it was slowing a push into high-margin services as a result of a slump in air travel but maintaining its diversification strategy.


  Some industry sources say Airbus has all but abandoned a goal of more than doubling services revenue to $10 billion this decade and transferred some staff to other roles. (Writing by Tim Hepher; Editing by Richard Lough and Mark Potter)

“We need supply cuts from other areas of the world,” Zuzolo said.


  He said if there are no changes from where the crop stands, meaning no weather issues or major upticks in demand, prices could fall back to the lows made in the spring.


  Wheat prices have been acting independently of corn and soybeans as the harvest is well underway in southern Illinois and Missouri. Prices broke down in mid-July due to better-than-expected yields, Zuzolo said, but as harvests move north, prices are creeping higher.


  “As we started to see the custom harvesters move up toward western Kansas, Nebraska and Colorado, yields are starting to fall from anywhere to a third or half,” Zuzolo said. “I talked with one wheat elevator today in Ohio and a client in Indiana, and all of them are worried about what kind of freeze damage they are going to see in their soft red wheat crop from earlier this spring.”

In Arab countries, where vast swaths of the economy are vendors, market stalls, and mom-and-pop shops, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted an age- old culture of marketplace haggling. With the gloves-disinfectant-face mask logistics of hygiene, and concern of close contact, shopping has struggled to evolve.


  “No one is relaxed, no one is stopping to speak, no one is engaging,” says Abu Mohammed, slumped over the counter at his empty store in downtown Amman, Jordan. “No matter if you have your best sales pitch, you can’t get people to stop and think about bartering and buying,” he says.


  Entrepreneurial merchants have come up with a handful of stopgap solutions. Some have opened WhatsApp groups updated by the hour where they can haggle with individual customers. Others rely on Facebook, posting images and encouraging bidding on limited items.


  But the measures can’t replace the intrigue and adrenaline rush of “naming your price.” “No matter the amount of technology, once we return closer to normal life, people will be back in the street shopping and bargaining,” predicts Bassam Arafeh, a scarf seller. “It’s not haggling; it’s human nature.”

As in her wrenching dramatic adaptation of Robert Kolker’s _Lost Girls_, an account of the unsuccessful search for the Long Island serial killer, who murdered 10 to 16 people and hid their bodies on the island’s south shore, Garbus focuses on ripples of damage that spread from a single violent event. The series (episodes of which were directed by Elizabeth Wolff, Myles Kane, and Josh Koury, as well as Garbus), interviews several survivors of DeAngelo’s more than 50 rapes. One, attacked at the age of 15 while playing the piano at home, was scolded by her father for even discussing the attack with a friend; in addition to the trauma of the assault, this drove a wedge between her parents and herself. The husband of a murdered woman lived under a cloud of suspicion for 20 years until DNA analysis revealed that his wife had been killed by a serial murderer. The daughter of another murder victim must live with the fact that her last interaction with her mother was a terrible argument.

In addition, a fine in the amount of one million Swiss francs has been imposed on Mr Kattner."In his role as finance director, Kattner was accused along with Blatter and Valcke of being involved in a coordinated effort to "enrich themselves" to the tune of more than $80 million in often suspicious payments over a five-year period.The disgraced Blatter and Valcke have already been banned from involvement in the sport. Blatter, who is 84, was president of FIFA between 1998 and 2015.Kattner, now 49, joined FIFA in 2003.

Just days out from the Eden-Monaro by-election, Labor is pledging to reverse ABC cuts if it wins government while the Morrison government has pushed ahead with the Snowy 2.0 renewable energy project.


  Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday visited the Snowy site in Kosciuszko National Park ahead of the Saturday by-election, and announced the mammoth project had been granted final approvals.


  Mr Morrison has promised it will create 2000 jobs during construction and generate billions of dollars of investment for the region.


  The project has been in the works for three years but Mr Morrison says electing Liberal candidate Fiona Kotvoys is crucial to delivering the jobs promise.


  The prime minister has resisted pressure to reveal the future of wage subsidies and the dole before the looming by-election.


  Opposition leader Anthony Albanese, meanwhile, will be on the campaign trail with Labor candidate Kristy McBain on Wednesday.


  Mr Albanese says reversing the $83.7 million of cuts over three years to ABC's budget would save regional jobs, protect critical emergency broadcasting and support local news and content.


  The government has repeatedly denied there are any cuts, and has previously said the ABC gets $1 billion a year in public money.


  Labor has already pledged to fix ABC local radio black spots in Eden-Monaro as well as power back-up for broadcasting transmission facilities so they work for longer during natural disasters.

“It is required by NDSU and state guidelines that people do need to pre- register before attending an in-person field day, and it will only be a limited number of people that can attend. No one can just show up and go to the field day,” Koch said.


  A committee headed by Chris Schauer, NDSU HREC director, initially came up with the idea of videos being recorded for the REC websites for virtual field days.


  All the research centers saw it as a good way to go this year, with COVID-19 still battering the nation, although numbers are low in North Dakota.


  “We’re hoping the virtual field day actually expands the number of producers who have access to the information (research),” Koch said. “It is always fun and interesting to be there in person and to develop those relationships, but as far as the reach, we’re hoping producers from other states, around the country, or even in Canada, watch the videos.”


  Producers, who see the videos and still have questions about the research, are encouraged to reach out to the scientists at the research center.


  Koch explained that if the research center is having a live Zoom meeting during their field day, producers could sit in their sprayers or in their shop, tune in and ask a question after the presentation.


  The Q&A session is an important addition for the centers.


  “Questions are always important to be answered, and that is why many of the research centers are choosing to do a live virtual field day over Zoom, show their pre-recorded videos and have a live Q&A,” she said.


  Research may be totally different at other centers.


  “Producers will have the opportunity to see research that they may never have heard about before,” Koch said. “Crops and research may be different in another area of the state. In fact, people from all other states or anywhere in the country could tune in and see our research.”


  Koch talked about what NDSU Ag Communications does for the NDSU network. They assist centers in communications, write NDSU press releases on ag topics and staff hires, and take videos for YouTube and NDSU websites, among other communication work.


  Her office provides each center with a template so they can create a website.


  Currently, they are creating an Ag Hub online.


  “We are working on an Ag Hub. If someone wants to know about a topic, say hemp, they can go to this site and it will link to the information about it,” she said. “We are trying to pull the content together to better serve our users.”


  For Sundeen, traveling throughout the state to all the research centers has been an enjoyable experience.


  “I learn a lot about research while filming,” Sundeen said. “I filmed a horticulturist and learned so much about how to care for my own lawn and garden. I use the information I hear.”


  He is planning to do a second round at the RECs in August.


  “Jerry Bergman at Williston Research Extension Center requested he come back. For one thing, the size of the crops will be different in a month,” Koch said. “In addition, some centers want to feature crops now and livestock or other research later.”


  For more information on what each research center and the seed farm have planned for field days, see the list at www.ag.ndsu.edu/research/field-days.

National homebuilding slowed considerably during the Great Recession, as the population continued to grow, which many analysts say created a lack of homes for sale. More recently, a drastic increase in sellers pulling homes off the market to wait for the virus to go away have been attributed to price wars for a limited number of properties.
 In San Diego County last year, the smallest number of housing units (apartments, single-family homes and condos) were built since 2014. The 8,053 homes constructed represented a 16 percent drop in construction, said the Real Estate Research Council of Southern California, and was the biggest homebuilding drop in Southern California. In April, the same time as the Case Shiller report, there were about 5,160 homes listed for sale, said the Redfin Data Center, a drop of 27 percent from the same time last year.
 Zillow economist Matthew Speakman wrote that the April index illustrates how low mortgage interest rates fueled demand even as there were fewer homes to chose from and drove up prices.
 The mortgage rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan was 3.31 percent in April, said Freddie Mac, down from 4.47 percent at the same time last year.

Bloomberg) -- European shares edged higher on the final day of their best quarter since March 2015, as investors continued to weigh the region's economic recovery against the risk of rising virus infections.


  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.1% at the close, after fluctuating between gains and losses as the World Health Organization warned that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is still to come. Tech shares and miners outperformed, while Royal Dutch Shell Plc dragged energy shares lower after warning of a record writedown. The benchmark is up 13% for the quarter, boosted by a strong rotation into cyclicals since mid-May.


  European equities posted a third straight monthly advance, helped by unprecedented stimulus measures and optimism that major economies can ease lockdowns without spurring a second wave of coronavirus infections. That's building a case for the region's stocks to continue a rare outperformance over the U.S., where infections are on the rise in several states.


  "Investors continue to weigh up rising coronavirus figures against signs of economic recovery and rising U.S.-China tension," said Fiona Cincotta, a market analyst at City Index. "Whilst rising coronavirus numbers and flare ups across the globe are keeping investors on edge, improving economic data is going some way to distracting investors."


  Historically, Europe is entering prime time. July is the period that the Stoxx 600 has posted its biggest monthly gain on average over the past decade. And it's chased up a May advance with one in June for the first time since 2005.


  All industry groups rose in the second quarter, except oil-and-gas shares, suffering from still weak demand for crude and delayed or cut dividends in the sector.


  Although tech shares are the biggest gainers, closing their best quarter since 2001, cyclicals have largely outperformed their defensive peers in the period. Carmakers jumped the most in five years and miners the most since 2010, while food-and-drink stocks lagged behind.

He told the board that “it is truly worthy that we invest in our Nebraska 4-H and FFA youth. I think it is important that we offer something in the time frame of the traditional Nebraska State Fair dates.”


  “The people of the community and the people of the state and nation are hungry for some wholesome social activity and what is more wholesome and wonderful than a fair,” Ogg said. “The idea of having that and doing it safely and appropriately and doing it affordably I think is the option for the fair board.”


  The Nebraska State Fair was coming into this year’s fair dealing with financial losses caused by the last two fairs, especially last year’s fair that suffered from a lack of attendance because of heavy rain.


  Ogg said the first priority in holding a fair this year is the health and safety of people attending the fair. The second priority, he said, is that “the Nebraska State Fair is here for the next 151 years and we don’t squander our limited resources on trying to do something this year that makes us unsustainable to go forward.”


  To keep the fair affordable and sustainable for the future, Ogg said this year’s fair budget has been reduced to $208,000 compared to a traditional fair budget of around $7 million.


  With the fair scheduled two months from now, health directives could change, such as the Central District Health Department decision to go to phase three, beginning next week. But health directives could change depending on the spread of the virus. The board decided to give Ogg and his staff the flexibility to scheduled other events, depending on current local and state health directives.


  That includes the carnival. Jeremy Jensen and other board members expressed concerns about having the carnival, especially as local schools begin the new school year. But by giving Ogg and his staff the flexibility to schedule other fair events, such as the carnival, it will help to make the event as safe as possible as health directives change.


  “It is worth the investment for more than 5,000 4-H and FFA members who participate in the State Fair,” he said.


  The decision to hold a modified Nebraska State Fair this year comes on the heels of Monday’s announcement that Husker Harvest Days had been canceled because of safety concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.


  Ogg told the board there was no “ideal or wonderful or positive choice” in deciding the fate of this year’s State Fair.


  “We are selecting from options that are either delegated to us by the very appropriate health measures that are in place because of this pandemic situation that certainly effects Hall County, Nebraska, as well as the country and the world,” he said.


  Ogg said because of the pandemic, there are restrictions that the fair has to follow for it to be safe for the public.


  He said there are also economic constraints for the fair to be able to allow certain events to happens, but would require extra spending to make those events safe for the public within the health and safety guideline.


  “It would make them so cost prohibitive that even the strongest supporter could not justify them,” Ogg said.

Starting July 15, all passengers have to wear a mask and must take a molecular test 72 hours prior to their arrival and submit the results to officials at the airport. Those who refuse to do so, or tested positive, or do not have the test results available, will be forced into a two-week quarantine. During that time, they have to undergo a molecular test and share the results if they want to be released from quarantine, said Puerto Rico Health Secretary Lorenzo González.

The first slide of the Q&A was titled “ _Why is Hockey Canada reluctant to get on board with this?_ ” Dr. McKegney quoted a story previously reported by Rick Westhead of TSN that Hockey Canada was establishing an Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Task Team to begin tracking incidents of racist abuse, bullying and harassment. But Dr. McKegney suggested Hockey Canada’s interest in anti- racism action has been lacklustre, and that their “unwillingness or anxiety to participate in these conversations” is problematic at best.

NEW YORK -- Oil prices slipped on Tuesday as investors worried that rising COVID-19 cases would hurt demand while supply could rise with a potential resurgence of Libyan oil production, which has slowed to a trickle since the start of the year.


  The more-active September contract for Brent was down 5 cents at $41.80 a barrel by 1:31 p.m. EST (1731 GMT), after gaining 92 cents in the previous session. The August contract, which expires on Tuesday, fell 52 cents, or 1.2%, to $41.19. The contract has gained 16.5% this month so far, and 81% on the quarter.


  U.S. crude was up 25 cents, or 0.6%, at $39.95 a barrel. U.S. crude has risen 12.4% in the past month, up about 95% in the quarter, reflecting its recovery from late March.


  Fuel demand has recovered from the worst weeks of the outbreak, but cases have been rising in southern and southwestern U.S. states. Northeastern states like New York and New Jersey doubled the number of states from which travelers face quarantine restrictions.


  "Sustaining the independent show of gasoline strength will be challenged by coronavirus headlines where news has seen a definite negative shift in recent weeks," Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a report.


  Investors will seek signs of demand recovery in weekly inventory data due on Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute industry group and from the U.S. government on Wednesday.


  Libya is trying to resume exports, which have been almost entirely blocked since January due to civil war. The state's oil company hopes talks will end a blockade by eastern-based forces.


  "If we do finally see a resumption in Libyan output, this would make the job of OPEC+ a little bit more difficult," said Dutch bank ING.


  A Reuters poll of analysts showed expectations that oil prices will consolidate at around $40 a barrel this year, with a recovery gaining steam in the fourth quarter.

A pair of Grayson County athletic programs have made changes to their summer workout schedules because of positive coronavirus tests.


   


  The Sherman ISD has moved its summer athletic workouts to a virtual setting after a coach informed the school district about a positive coronavirus test while Tioga ISD cancelled activities for the next two weeks following positive tests by family members of two athletes.


   


  Tioga athletic director and head football coach Cody Patton made the following announcement Monday morning on Twitter: "I apologize for the following message but as a safety precaution and to protect the health and well being of our student-athletes; All Tioga Summer Workouts including sports specific are cancelled for the next two weeks. We will try to resume on July 13th if possible."


   


  At Sherman a small group of students and employees having direct contact with the coach were immediately notified over the weekend, a letter was sent to the parents of all student-athletes to notify them of the situation and led to the alteration of the off-season program.


   


  "Although guidance from the Grayson County Health Department does not require the district to suspend the Summer Strength & Conditioning workouts, out of an abundance of caution, the district will transition to a virtual workout format on June 29 through July 3," Sherman ISD said in a statement. "Virtual workouts will continue during the previously scheduled off week, July 6 through July 10. The district plans to resume the in-person Summer Strength & Conditioning workout schedule for all athletes on July 13."


   


  Both schools had held three weeks of in-person workouts after the University Interscholastic League allowed schools to resume off-season activities earlier this month.


   


  But the Bearcats and Bulldogs became just the latest athletic programs across the state in dealing with the recent resurgence of positive coronavirus tests.


   


  Next week Sherman and Tioga were not scheduled to hold any sessions because the UIL had made July 7-8 part of five dates to keep facilities unavailable for athletes and so the Bearcats and Bulldogs were going to take off the entire week as a follow-up to the Fourth of July holiday weekend, in which July 3 is also a blacked-out date on the UIL's calendar.


   


  If there are no both, Sherman will return to its in-person workouts on July 13 through the end of the month as part of the lead-up to what will hopefully be the start of the fall sport seasons -- volleyball, cross-country and football.


   


  In order for students to avoid missing any more time off in light of the positive test, Sherman will be using the website rackperformance.com so that athletes can continue to train at home in a safe environment. Rack Performance provides coaches with an easy-to-use online tool that creates, customizes and tracks a strength and conditioning program. Workouts will be posted each day at 9 a.m.


   


  Since the summer workouts began, school districts around Texas have had to deal with positive tests in some form or fashion. The first came less than a week into the resumption of activities and the numbers of those programs affected have increased steadily.


   


  Sherman was one of more than a dozen to deal with this over the weekend and some school districts, like Lake Dallas and Garland, have preemptively shut down workouts despite them not producing any positive tests.


   


  Other programs have stopped due to either an athlete, coach or an athlete's family member testing positive, either until July 13 or indefinitely -- like Harlingen chose to do on Sunday. Some schools, such as Bonham, have kept their normal schedule after isolating those who came in contact with a positive case. West Orange-Stark has had multiple positive tests and still continued workouts.


   


  Schools were allowed to begin those workouts on June 8, a nearly three-month gap without any UIL activities after the state's governing body initially suspended action in mid-March and then extended that to an indefinite cancellation before announcing off-season conditioning guidelines on May 22.


   


  Among the rules and regulations included two-hour limits per day for strength and conditioning sessions and 90 minutes per day for sport specific skill instruction from Monday to Friday, athletes would not have access to locker rooms or shower facilities, provide their own food and water and a limit of students was in place based on location.


   


  The guidelines were given with an eye towards a normal resumption of the 2020-21 high school sports calendar -- volleyball and cross-country practices are still slated to begin on August 3 and competition set to start the following week. Football practices are scheduled to start on August 5 with the first Friday of the regular season being August 28.


   


  The UIL has stated it will continue to work with state officials and monitor Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal guidance to determine any potential modifications to these guidelines or the potential start of the calendar in 35 days.


   


  Less than a day after workouts began, the UIL adjusted some rules which went into effect on June 22 -- teams can now have 50 percent of their indoor capacity, up from the original 25 percent allowed, and the number of students working in outdoor groups went from a maximum of 15 to a maximum of 25 and those in indoor groups increased from a max of 10 students to a max of 15 students. The ratio of needing one coach per 20 students in attendance has been removed.


   


  The UIL also altered its wording in regards to cleaning equipment, saying those surfaces should be thoroughly disinfected before and after use. The initial guideline said that equipment must be thoroughly disinfected.


   


  "Sherman ISD will continue to take every precaution to keep our coaches and student-athletes safe during this time," the statement said.
