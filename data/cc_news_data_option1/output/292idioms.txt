Contreras has been the librarian media specialist at Russell Dougherty for eight years. Prior to that she was at Summit Middle School for 11 years teaching gifted and talented students. She taught yearbook, newspaper, reading and leadership. Before coming to Oklahoma, she taught in Arizona for 4 1⁄2 years.
 “She is a wonderful resource to our students and teachers and is always looking for ways to expand the impact of the library,” said Principal Penny Dilg. “Her lessons not only address reading, but also incorporate science, math and technology.
 “Mrs. Contreras is eager to make Russell Dougherty an excellent place to grow and learn for all of us and continues to seek out ways to increase her own knowledge through professional development and serving on district and state committees. She is truly dedicated to her role as an educator.”
 Contreras has a non-traditional approach to becoming a teacher.
 “I am dedicated to my students and to fostering a love of learning in them,” Contreras said. “To that end, I will dress up for book fairs and all of our school spirit days. I want the students to know that I am there for them and that they are valued in this world.”
 She spent many years with her children volunteering in classrooms and for activities that continually put her into a teaching role.
 “I had considered teaching as a career before becoming a parent, and this became my goal as I raised my own children,” Contreras said.
 When her youngest child was four years old and began pre-school, Contreras went back to school.
 “I gained an Associate of Arts degree from Leeward Community College, then went on to the University of Hawaii, Manoa, for my Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education,” Contreras said.
 She followed her husband from Hawaii to Arizona and began her teaching career in the classroom teaching 7th and 8th grade English, reading, social studies, algebra and the Gifted and Talented students.
 “While in Arizona, I was given the opportunity to join a cohort for my Masters of Educational Psychology with an emphasis in Leadership and Learning,” Contreras said. “As I was finishing this degree, my husband was given orders to move to Tinker Air Force Base.”
 Contreras said entering the teaching profession has been the best choice she could make for a career.
 “I am given the opportunity to interact with students on a daily basis and help instill in them a love for learning that will allow them to move into a productive life as an adult,” she said.
 Contreras said her own children have been the most influential in her educational life.
 “As I said earlier, my youngest was in preschool when I returned to school It was very deja vous esque — that I graduated with a second Masters in Instructional Media Technology (Library) on Friday night, and my son graduated with his Bachelor of Fine Arts on Saturday morning — both of us from the University of Central Oklahoma,” Contreras said. “We went to school together his whole life.”
 During circulation time each week students are given time to visit the library and change out their books. During this time Contreras sees every student in the building every week.
 “I am a constructivist,” she said. “I believe that children are curious about everything and in order for learning to have valid meaning, we have to help students find the connections with what they are learning to their own lives.”

For the first 30 games or so, it was pretty much a mystery what the Blue Jackets would show each night. That question never seemed to apply to Pierre- Luc Dubois.
   
 The 21-year-old center is on pace to post more than the 20 goals and 28 assists he had as a rookie and is nearly at the same pace as his 61 points (including 27 goals) last season as the Jackets head into the All-Star break in playoff position.
   
 Similar to just about every player on the ice with Artemi Panarin last season when he was a Blue Jacket, Dubois benefited offensively. He looked like he was on the fast track to being a reliable top- or second-line center, but that would be tested when he was no longer beside Panarin.
   
 Dubois has quashed all doubts that he'd be just a solid center with 15 goals and 20 assists through 50 games entering one Wednesday night at Nationwide Arena against the Winnipeg Jets. The Jackets rely on him as a top scorer and facilitator as much as any other player.
   
 The next step for Dubois is becoming a true All-Star-caliber power forward.
   
 "He has a chance to be a great player," coach John Tortorella said. "It's our job as coaches as we go through it to make sure he's staying on top of himself to become that."
   
 Tortorella holds Dubois to the high standard Dubois sets for himself. With his large frame, speed and propensity for physical play, the Jackets need him to behave like a forward who wins competitions for the puck along the wall and turns them into scoring chances.
   
 He can make the play, but that's an area of his game that separates him from taking the next step in his development.
   
 "It's been a little inconsistent, quite honestly," Tortorella said. "It's something that we're always talking about is trying to stay consistent with it."
      
 Dubois has shown he can make that play plenty of times. On Oct. 24 against Carolina, Dubois spun past a defender along the boards and delivered a perfect pass for the winning goal in overtime.
   
 "It's extremely important," Dubois said. "It doesn't happen overnight. It's repetition and it's learning and getting put into situations where you learn on the fly type of thing. In order to become the type of player I think I can become, I have to try stuff. You see what works, what doesn't work. You make mistakes sometimes, but that's all a part of the process to become a better player."
   
 When thinking about the Blue Jackets who can be perennial All-Stars on this team, Seth Jones is one and it's only a matter of time before Zach Werenski is there, too. Dubois has to be on that list, given all he's done.
   
 He's still one of the youngest players on the team and plays perhaps the most important role among the forwards. Jones, a sound physical player, sometimes can't believe the spots Dubois can get through with the puck.
   
 Becoming more consistent in winning control of the puck and bringing pucks to the net is the key for Dubois to be even more of a force as a top center.
   
 "We look for him every game to be that player, to be that guy," Jones said. "He can't take nights off with our team because we put a lot of weight on his shoulders."
   
 Where's Milano?
   
 The Jackets have a good thing going, and that has left Tortorella with some tough decisions as players return from injury.
   
 Cam Atkinson and Oliver Bjorkstrand returned last week, which resulted in Kevin Stenlund being sent back to the minors and Sonny Milano being a healthy scratch in the three games before Wednesday.
   
 Although Tortorella thought Milano's play dipped in the two games before Atkinson returned, his removal from the lineup wasn't so much about his play as it was about keeping continuity on the fourth line and having no choice but to insert Atkinson and Bjorkstrand when they came back.
   
 "I'm not crazy about taking out his skills, but I also have to measure that with chemistry within lines, especially within the (Riley) Nash line," Tortorella said. "I think that changes some of my decision-making."
      
 With Josh Anderson skating and possibly returning soon after the All-Star and players' association-mandated breaks, Milano might have another hurdle in getting back in.
   
 But Tortorella doesn't want to keep Milano out much longer. He was one of the more consistent offensive performers toward the end of December into January, even if it didn't show in the box score.
   
 "I don't want to keep him out a lot longer because I think he's given us some good minutes," Tortorella said. "I don't want to lose him because I think he's really tried defensively, but that's where we're at right now."

Few situations in sports are as anxiety-provoking, unnerving and intimidating as the basketball free throw.
 On the surface, it's hardly frightening. It's an unguarded 15-foot shot, an unobstructed attempt to score in a sport where getting that opportunity in open play is a rare occurrence. It's as simple as can be.
 But basketball is a fast-paced game by nature. Foul shots pause that speediness and instantly thrust a player, ready or not, into the spotlight. Add in external factors — screaming fans, nervousness, frustration, etc., to name a few — and one slip of the hand, one blip in the routine or one distraction can throw the shooter out of whack.
 With all eyes in the arena suddenly on the taker, the free throw becomes the loneliest play in basketball. It's a skill to be efficient from the foul line, and it doesn't come easy.
 So, even as Missouri men's basketball trudges through its current three-game losing streak, its new place in the NCAA Division I record book for the most consecutive free throws made — set over the course of the Tigers' defeats at Alabama and against Texas A&M — is an outstanding and remarkable achievement in keeping cool, calm and collected.
 Coach Cuonzo Martin and crew probably would've traded NCAA immortality for a couple of more wins. Still, Martin understood that what was done Saturday and Tuesday was historic.
 "There's pain in a journey you go through, but that was the pleasure of it," Martin said. "Those guys did something that will go down in history, but all them guys will say they wanted to win the game more than anything. But we've got to keep plugging along."
 Missouri's record streak of 54 consecutive made free throws ended with forward Mitchell Smith missing a chance to tie the game against the Aggies at 63 with 29.5 seconds remaining, breaking the previous record of 50 set by a Chris Paul-led Wake Forest in 2004-05. Ironically, the Demon Deacons' streak also ended late in a close game, as Taron Downey missed a chance to break a 76-76 tie with four seconds left in regulation against Florida State on Jan. 18, 2005.
 Nine different players contributed to the Tigers' streak, with Dru Smith (16 for 16) carrying the heaviest bulk of the load. Following in order were Mitchell Smith (9 for 9), Xavier Pinson (9 for 9), Torrence Watson (7 for 7), Mark Smith (4 for 4), Reed Nikko (4 for 4), Tray Jackson (2 for 2), Javon Pickett (2 for 2) and Kobe Brown (1 for 1). The 54 straight makes improved Missouri's cumulative season free throw percentage to 77.4%, which ranks 16th in the country.
 Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams said postgame that he thought Missouri led the country in free throw percentage, along with his catch that Mitchell Smith hadn't missed a free throw all season entering Tuesday. He's slightly off — the Tigers are ninth nationally since New Year's Day — but shooting 82% and being the best foul-shooting team in the Southeastern Conference since the start of the year is nothing to downplay.
 "I was watching the Alabama game, and I kind of restrict my social media usage during the season. I did not know when I was watching the game that they were 31 for 31," Williams said. "So you know, I'm studying the game and I'm like, 'They make a lot of free throws.' So I started keeping up with it. In our game charts when I'm filling out the personnel stuff and I'm looking at the cumulative stats, I don't think (Smith) has missed a free throw all year, right?"
 But what exactly goes into an unprecedented streak of consecutive free throws?
 Per experts and sports scientists, it's more about what you're thinking rather than how you're shooting. In a study published in the Journal of Clinical Sports Psychology in 2009, scientists Amy Gooding and Frank L. Gardner concluded from analyzing 17 Division I men's basketball players' free throw routines and percentages from practice and games that a player's mindfulness matters at the foul line.
 They found that in the isolated, more controlled confines of the practice gym, the players in the study had an average free throw percentage of 80.7%. In games, where externals like crowd noise and fatigue could play more of a factor, those same players' percentages dropped to an average of 67.8%.

Philomath High senior Dylan Edwards didn’t take the easy road to becoming a varsity starter for the boys basketball team.
 During his freshman and sophomore seasons, he fought through the various challenges that young players typically face as they try to sharpen skills and catch the attention of coaches. As a junior, he mostly played on the junior varsity but did have a few opportunities to play at the top level.
 Coach Blake Ecker mentioned Edwards during preseason interviews as an example of an athlete who worked hard, improved himself and is now a major contributor in Philomath’s lineup.
 “The first two years were on JVII and I had a little bit of a rocky start but then it got better JV season,” Edwards said Tuesday after scoring 23 points in the Warriors’ 53-37 victory over Sisters. “I’m glad that during the JV season, they let me come up to varsity a few times and I got to play in a few games.”

The Titans recently finished third in the Cross County Invite that featured Class B contender Central City and Class C No. 5 Amherst this past Saturday. They defeated Columbus Scotus 65-18 in a dual on Monday and are currently ranked No. 8 in the dual rankings in the NSWCA.
 Twin River coach Kalin Koch said he’s been pleased with how the season has gone. The Titans shattered the school record at the Cross County Invite with 199 points.
 “I’m been impressed with how the kids have wrestled this year,” Koch said. “We knew at the beginning of the year, we had potential to have success. We have a few kids coming with a lot of experience who did a lot of offseason work. We’ve really been wrestling well since the Christmas break.”
 The Titans have been rewarded for their success. After finishing second to York in the Fillmore Central Invite, they gave No. 9 Battle Creek its only loss in duals in a 39-24 battle, then beat Class D No. 4 Neligh-Oakdale 40-39 in back-to-back duals. That success helped Twin River get recognized as the Class C team of the week by the newrestle.com web site.
 “We’ve been carrying momentum since that time and we really haven’t looked back,” Koch said. “We’ve been rolling with it since then.”
 A few wrestlers have been recognized for their success as well. Tucker Alexander is ranked No. 6 at 195 in both the NSWCA and newrestle polls, while Jaxson Jones is No. 6 at 160 in the newrestle.com site.
 Koch said the two wrestlers have put in a lot of time after both were a match away from getting a medal at the state wrestling tournament last year.
 “Both were so close to getting state medals,” Koch said. “Both are hard- working kids. Tucker is one of our team captains who has been doing very well this year. Jaxson, who is a two-time state qualifier, has missed most of the season because of a football injury. He’s been looking fantastic as far as technique goes and his conditioning is getting back there. Both have been great leaders for us.”
 Juan Davalos, another returning state qualifier, along with Beau Zoucha, Mason Tenski, Rooco Gehring, Ashton Johnson, Jackson Strain, Jed Jones and Korbe Urkoski have also impressed Koch this season.
 Koch said a reason for the Titan’s success is the offseason work they’ve put in. He said that the wrestlers combined to wrestle 250 plus matches during the offseason.
 “I told the kids after the season ended last year that we needed to get as much mat time in the offseason as much as we could, whether it’s at camps or offseason tournaments,” Koch said. “They were wrestling as much as they could and that has helped a lot.”
 Now the Titans want to be one of the teams competing at the state duals in a few weeks. As of Jan. 22, they are in sitting in fifth in the NSAA power point standings.
 Koch said Twin River is in great position for that to happen, but knows a lot of things will need to happen. They wrestle a triangular with Class D No. 1 Plainview and Fremont Bergan on Jan. 30.

PLYMOUTH - Pinehills Managing Partner Tony Green was in good spirits last week as his partnership with Brookfield Properties and New England Development yielded results - big results.
 Brookfield Properties has been awarded master developer with New England Development and Green's company Green Southfield as partners in the redevelopment of the 1,400 acre former Naval Air Station South Weymouth, which closed in 1997. The Southfield Redevelopment Authority voted unanimously for Brookfield Properties as master developer of the site, known as Union Point.
 Located in the towns of Weymouth, Rockland and Abington, redevelopment of Union Point - formerly SouthField - has been anything but a smooth ride as one after another master developer has been unable to gain altitude with any number of plans.
 The latest multi-use project posited a smart city with 4,000 homes, commercial space galore, green roofs, hiking trails and ponds. Everything from a college campus to a sport complex and theater were proposed. But the plan stalled as others had, and the SouthField Redevelopment Authority went searching for another master developer.
 "We have the master developer designation and have the opportunity to go through a master planning process with the SRA and all three towns to re- envision something that would be terrific and would work there," Green said last week.
 The property is located west of Exit 14 on Route 3.
 According to its write-up, Brookfield Properties boasts 50 master planned communities and $200 billion in assets, and has developed 450 million square feet of commercial space, manages 60,000 apartments, has 40,000 million square feet of development under construction and has 19,000 employees.
 New England Development has constructed 4,000 multi-family units in the state, has developed $2 billion in real estate, manages 50 million square feet of leasable space and takes a collaborative approach on projects, according to its write-up. Seeking input from community leaders and partnering with state and city entities, neighbors residents and tenants has resulted in projects that are well received and successful, according to New England Development.
 Green Southfield, Green's company, has developed 3,065 homes as well as 1.3 million square feet of mixed-use space and has added $1.35 billion to Plymouth's tax base. The Pinehills nets the town of Plymouth more than $22 million in tax revenue annually.
 As managing partner of The Pinehills, Green was instrumental in the vision, master planning and approval process for this multi-use village. Green has a master's degree in planning from Harvard, is past chairman of the Residential Neighborhood Council at Urban Land Institute and has lectured on land development and planning at MIT, Tufts, Harvard, Duke and the Environmental Protection Agency.
 Green said that in recent memory three different development companies tried their hand at Union Point and failed. He said his team is not yet sure what the specific plan will be. Talking to the communities and getting a solid read from the stakeholders is an important first step.
 "We know there's a village center component and a housing component and some more commercial beyond that, but we haven't gone through the planning process yet, so you don't know," he said.
 Green noted that his team's broad range of experience in a variety of large projects make it ideal for Union Point and the many facets that will need to be addressed. He's looking forward to this, he added.
 A portion of the Union Point already features 1,200 single-family homes, townhouses and apartments. The three towns are hoping this three-member team does what the others haven't been able to do - finish the project.

Reading the title of this column you might think it is an advertisement for the sale of a long term care insurance policy. It isn't. In fact, it is just the opposite. Much of what follows is very personal with me, perhaps too personal to be published in newspapers across the country. Too bad. Readers need to be aware of some of the hazards related to long-term care insurance policies. Let the insurance folks sue. As a boxing commentator used to say, "I tell it like it is."      On the national level we talk a lot about universal insurance coverage, the next generation after Obamacare. We all need to remember that insurance companies are in the business of taking in premiums. Unfortunately, they are exceedingly adept at not paying out claims. The end result for people who need help from their insurance companies to handle the ever higher prices for medical services is a constant fight to get some of their money back when insurance coverage is needed.      Twenty years ago when my wife and I were approaching 60 years of age we made what we thought was a prudent decision to help cover future necessities for health care as we aged. We bought a long-term care plan for each of us. The cost? We have paid the carrier approximately $220 a month for almost two decades. If you are counting that is approaching $40,000.      Today, we need their help. My wife has stage 4 cancer that she has been fighting for almost two years. We could use the long-term care coverage we have been paying for. Unfortunately, they say she does not meet the requirements in the fine print of the policy. As is generally true, the devil is in the details and the details are in the fine print. There is a cover sheet that says whenever the doctor testifies that she meets their necessities we will have 90 days to wait before payments can begin. That is pretty standard and my signature is at the bottom of the page where the 90-day waiting period is noted. The monthly coverage is $135, not quite enough to cover a monthly rate at a local assisted living unit but enough to be helpful.      What is not there and is nowhere I can find on any document with my signature on it is the requirement that my wife be unable to feed or dress herself prior to applying for the coverage. I am sure I didn't agree to that but it is certainly in the fine print that they have sent me to justify their decision not to begin payments. Reason tells me that such a requirement makes no sense. By the time a person cannot feed or dress herself, one can assume that the end will not be long in coming. In many communities, Hospice, a free service, will have stepped in with their services and taken over helping take the person toward their end.      So, did I do a dumb thing 20 years ago and agree to pay $40,000 for something that is simply not feasible? I don't think so, but proof is not on my side. They have the money and the lawyers to fight whatever resistance they receive from me.      So, what is the solution to my problem? In truth, there may not be one. My purpose for writing this column is to warn those who don't have such policies not to buy and those who do to read the fine print. A good alternative is to take the amount that the policy costs and put it in the bank each month in a savings account. When you need it, perhaps 30 years down the road, it will be there for your use and you will not have to fight with anyone to get the help you need.   You can reach Dr. Mark L. Hopkins at marklhopkins@att.net.

The Oregon State gymnastics team took a step forward on Saturday, but there’s plenty of room for the Beavers to get better.
 OSU finished with a 195.325 to win a three-team meet against Seattle Pacific (189.525) and Centenary 182.625.
 The Beavers improved from last week’s score of 194.450 at the Critique Classic in Kissimmee, Florida, but continued to deal with a few rough patches.
 “I feel like this was a whole new vibe,” Kaitlyn Yanish said. “Last weekend, it was a good start for us, it was a little weird here and there but I feel just being back in Gill it brings back the magic and all the spice and I feel like we feel so comfortable and at home here. It was just completely different from last weekend.”
 The Beavers got strong performances from a few of their experienced gymnasts, but coach Tanya Chaplin said some of the younger athletes are still finding their way.
 “We have a lot of newbies competing and they’re trying so hard that they’re creating mistakes,” Chaplin said. “So they’re trying to stick those landings and then that actually creates them to tighten up and take a step forward instead of just relax into the landing. So the heart is in the right place. They’re pushing as hard as they can and that’s good to see. Now with each week that confidence will continue to grow.
 “So it’s kind of finding out who are those first couple of people in each lineup. We have a few that we’re playing with in different spots to try and figure who is it that’s going to be those go-to people at the end of season, so you’ll probably see some shuffling on a few events here and there still.”
 The Beavers had a solid start on vault. Madi Dagen scored a 9.800, Lacy Dagen a 9.825 and Yanish wound up with a 9.850 to win the event. The Beavers finished with a 48.850 on the event.
 Bars became a significant struggle. The Beavers had a fall and were forced to count a 9.375 by Isis Lowery and a 9.600 by Sabrina Gill, who suffered an injury during her routine and was forced out of the beam rotation.
 Colette Yamaoka had a 9.725, Alyssa Minyard scored a 9.775 and Halli Briscoe came through with a 9.850 for first and the Beavers finished with a 48.325.
 “We obviously started off a little slower than we would have liked but we came back and after bars we kind of reset and we were like, let’s not live in the past, let’s just focus on what we have next,” Lowery said. “I think we did a great job of flipping it and just going into beam and floor and being aggressive and just attacking our routines.”
 The Beavers were able to overcome Gill’s absence on beam as Madi Dagen scored a 9.825 and Lowery hit a 9.875 before Maela Lazaro anchored with a 9.850.
 “There were a few wobbles here and there but overall they fought and the majority of the beam routine was really solid,” Chaplin said
 A strong finish to the meet came on floor. Kristina Peterson had a 9.750, Savanna Force came through with a 9.850 and Lowery and Yanish capped off the scoring with 9.925s.
 “Isis has been really, really consistent and it just was off (on bars),” Chaplin said. “But she came back on the next two events and did a phenomenal job with a 9.875 and a 9.925.”
 Lowery said the Beavers don’t get caught up in worrying about scores during a meet.
 “I think we do a really good job of not letting the scores affect us,” she said. “We can’t control that. We’re not doing a routine and then sitting up on the table and judging ourselves. So we just try to focus on what we can control and that’s our gymnastics. Regardless of what the scores come up as, we can’t change that. We’ve just got to go out there and do our best not to give them anything to take.”

 The theme for Redbud was originated by Cathey Bugg, principal at Heritage.
 “It will center around the transition of a seed to a tree, similar to how our students grow from the time they enter elementary school,” Bugg said.
 The exterior has touches of wood paneling (metal) to incorporate earth tones, also the color scheme is green (representing the earth), blue (representing water), yellow (representing the sun), and purple ( the blooms of redbud trees), Coffelt said.
 The students, parents, and staff have been involved in selecting mascots at Frontier and Heritage elementary schools, Coffelt added, “and I would anticipate the same for Redbud.”

"You were talking in your sleep last night," I said to my husband when he stumbled into the kitchen that morning. I handed him a cup of Espresso to jolt him out of his coma.      "No, I wasn't," he said.      "How would you know," I said. "You were asleep. I was not asleep … because you were talking in your sleep."      "I don't talk in my sleep," he said as he sat down at the table. The dog came over for a scratch behind the ears or maybe just to take my husband's side.      "Well, you did last night," I said. "And you were very adamant about it."      Now my husband was interested. I'm sure he thought he had perhaps divulged some husband secret from deep within his subconscious, like, the fact that he purposely hangs the toilet paper the wrong way just to make me crazy.      "What did I say?" he wondered.      "Begone," I replied.      "I said 'begone?'" he repeated.      "Yes."      He shook his head. "I would never say 'begone.' I'd say 'Get lost,' but I wouldn't say 'begone.' I think you heard it wrong. Maybe I said, 'poupon.'"      "Were you dreaming about mustard?" I said.      "Unlikely," he admitted. We were both silent as we wondered what had inspired him to yell out "begone" in his sleep. Maybe he had dreamed he was a king's attendant in a Shakespeare play, or a French knight in a Monty Python movie. Perhaps he was a hobbit standing his ground in the Shire, or a constable clearing the cobblestone streets of Old England from lollygaggers. Or maybe he dreamed it was 200 years ago and I was berating him for hanging the toilet paper the wrong way and he yelled at me to "begone."      This wasn't the first time he had talked in his sleep. There was the time he did a musical countdown and conducted an orchestra while he slept, smacking me in the face as he directed the string section. Another time he yelled out, 'Who's there!" and I jumped out of bed and hid in the closet thinking there was an intruder in the house. And one time he told me to bring the camels inside, even though we lived in the suburbs and we weren't zoned for domesticated desert pets.      Sleeping with my husband was not restful, but it was certainly entertaining.      "Did I say anything else," he asked, hoping for some insight into the source of his nocturnal mumblings.      I thought for a moment. He had said some other things but mostly under his breath so I couldn't make them out.      "I don't know," I finally said. "Maybe I dreamed it."      "Probably," he said. "'Cuz I would never say 'begone.'"   "Okay. Anyway, honey, I have to run," I said, putting on my jacket. "I have an appointment. Would you mind taking the dog out?" I thrust the leash at him.      "Fine," he said. "Begone."   You can follow Tracy on Twitter @TracyBeckerman and become a fan on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LostinSuburbiaFanPage.
