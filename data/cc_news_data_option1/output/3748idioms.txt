Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic said Congress needs to provide additional fiscal support for the U.S. economy, which has lost momentum as some aid has lapsed and the coronavirus pandemic has lasted longer than expected.
 “We definitely see signs of slowing,” Bostic, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said Friday in a Bloomberg Television interview with Michael McKee. “What I would tell a policy maker is, there are lots of sectors where there is still a lot of pain and disruption that is going on. There are a lot of families who have a significant amount of uncertainty and those things will wear on our psyche and our ability to grow.”
 Fed officials held interest rates near zero this week and signaled they would stay there for at least three years, vowing to delay tightening until the U.S. gets back to maximum employment and its 2% inflation target. The Federal Open Market Committee stressed there was a high level of uncertainty with much of the outlook depending on the course of the virus.
 “Eviction levels in Atlanta are higher now than a year ago and the trend is going in the wrong direction,” Bostic said. “I have heard reports this is happening all over the place.”
 New Framework
 The Fed last month adopted a new monetary policy framework calling for an average 2% inflation, allowing for overshooting for past misses. This week’s statement pledged no rate hikes until the Fed achieved its inflation and maximum employment goals.
 “The policies coming out of the long-run framework are important because we are committing to letting the economy grow a little more robustly than we might have otherwise,” Bostic said. “That has and should have positive implications for the ability of minorities and women and lower-income people to be fully attached to the economy.”
 Stronger Guidance
 Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented from this week’s statement because he felt the wording left open the door to premature tightening, he said in an essay published earlier on Friday. He preferred a stronger commitment to getting inflation up to the Fed’s goal.
 “Not raising rates for roughly a year after core inflation first crosses 2% is consistent with a strategy of aiming for a modest overshoot in order to achieve average inflation of 2%,” Kashkari said. “We would only lift off once we had demonstrated that we really were at maximum employment, because core inflation would have had to actually hit or exceed 2% on a sustained basis in order to lift off.”

The first thing that jumps out to you when you look at Penn State’s schedule is Ohio State in Week 2. On Halloween. You might call that spooky. And from there, you’re hit straight with the concern that the Nittany Lions only get one “tune-up” against Indiana before they have to play the biggest game they’ll play all season. That’s one chance for Kirk Ciarrocca to see his new offense in action. But despite that, I’m going to make the argument here that playing Ohio State early on in the season is a good thing. Let’s be honest: On paper, Ohio State is the better team. Ohio State has beaten the Nittany Lions in each of the last three seasons and was in total control for most of last season’s game despite some turnover trouble. Justin Fields is the best quarterback in the conference and might be the best quarterback in the country. All of that is to say, it might be a good thing for Penn State to play them before they’re fully clicking, even if the Nittany Lions might not have things running smoothly by Week 2 either, because the Buckeyes’ best is likely better than Penn State’s best.
 From there, you look at the crossover games. Penn State will be happy to avoid Wisconsin, but Iowa and Nebraska will both likely be tough games. You’d certainly rather see an Illinois or a Purdue on the schedule if you’re James Franklin. It also leaves the Nittany Lions with a pretty tough three-game stretch just after the midway point of the season, which will send them to Nebraska, before returning home for Iowa, then going to Michigan. Even if you think the Nittany Lions are better than that trio, it will be difficult to get through all three of those games without a dent.

S. Mahesh ends his evening walks with a ritual that takes in the six streets of P.P. Garden, a neighbourhood opposite Ampa Skywalk in Aminjikarai. At each of these six streets, a wooden pole has been installed, with a cloth bag crowning it.
 Residents deposit the plastic waste in these bags, and Mahesh collects it at the end of the day. He would then proceed to his terrace and segregate the contents of the six bags into reusable and non-reusable plastic waste.
 Mahesh’s initiative, which kicked off in May this year, is allied to the larger goal of making the streets in the neighbourhood litter-free, particularly free of plastic waste. He has been conducting a sustained campaign toward this goal.
 Mahesh, an interior designer who also teaches free drawing to children, at the Anna Nagar Tower Park, and his team of volunteers seek to drive the campaign through art. The plastic bottles could be upcycled into art items. On September 16, which is World Ozone Day, they created an installation art with the plastic bottles collected from the neighbourhood, mostly along the Cooum and North Buckingham Canal. P.P. Garden is located close to these waterways. There was a striking image of a fish made of discarded plastic bottles.
 Children in the neighbourhood also contribute to the initiative by depositing in the cloth bags the plastic waste they have collected. As an incentive, free chocolates and play items are given to these children.
 The lockdown has helped Mahesh and his team of volunteers reach many residents in the neighbourhood as most of them are staying at home.
 “As a boy, I would play on these streets along with my neighbours. As I know the residents very well, I have been able to talk to them and persuade them to avoid using plastics as far as they can,” says Mahesh.
 ## A joint initiative
 Taking a cure from Mahesh’s initiative, Monisha Balamurugan, a post-graduate student in social work, has been doing similar work on her street, Manappa Street in Royapuram for a month.
 She has tied a cloth bag on a neem tree on the street in the neighbourhood encouraging her neighbours to dump plastic waste in it. Monisha also uses her terrace as the source-segregation spot. Though their sustainability work is focussed around their respective neighbourhoods, Mahesh and Monisha see it as a joint initiative.
 “Our parents are very supportive of our initiative. We also started a non- profit association as a platform to rope in young volunteers for the initiative,” says Monisha.
 They undertake door-to-door collection of plastic waste with their volunteers in their respective neighbourhoods.

This looks to me like a pretty tough draw. The Nittany Lions’ previous schedule featured crossover games against Northwestern, Illinois, Nebraska and Iowa. The new slate eliminates the Wildcats and Illini, two teams that went a combined 9-16 last season, and keeps the Cornhuskers and Hawkeyes. Yes, Nebraska has been in a rut lately, and no, the Lions aren’t going to have a hostile crowd ready to greet them in Lincoln. But this still looks like a very dangerous game in a place where Penn State hasn’t won since 1981. It’s hard for me to believe that Scott Frost isn’t going to get that program pointed back in the right direction sooner or later.
 As for the divisional games, everyone is fixated on the week two matchup vs. Ohio State. That’s understandable; it’s weird to have a potentially season- defining game taking place so early in the schedule. But the opener at Indiana also gives me pause. When Penn State faced the Hoosiers two years ago, Michael Penix Jr. suffered an ACL injury and had to leave the game. Last year, Penix sat out the Hoosiers’ visit to Beaver Stadium due to a season-ending shoulder injury he received two weeks earlier against Northwestern. When healthy, Penix has been a very dynamic dual-threat quarterback. This year, he should be in great physical shape for his matchup with Penn State, which means he’ll be a tough guy to chase down, especially for a defense that hasn’t done much tackling since last December. The Ohio State game looms large, as it always does, but the Lions absolutely can’t afford to look past their opener.

George said having his brothers go through the recruiting process was extremely beneficial to his process. George chose UL over Air Force, Army, Florida Atlantic and Navy. George said at times the recruiting process was stressful but in the end, he said being close to home was a big reason he chose the Cajuns.
 “Being from Lafayette definitely played a factor,” George said. “I had a lot of offers and it was overwhelming at times. I feel like I handled it the best I could and I made the right decision for me.”
 George said the Cajuns’ defensive scheme fits his game very well and Seibold agreed. Seibold said George can play with his hand on the ground or without.
 “I know UL does some stuff with their outside linebackers where they are standing up.” Semibold said. “We have done enough of that with Cam over the last couple years that it won’t be completely foreign to him if they ask him to stand up. Cam is coachable and smart and he can do anything they ask him to do.”

His team plans to issue several subpoenas by Monday to the office of Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren, the Rochester Police Department, the city law department and the city council itself. But those four subpoenas are just the start, Celli said, and he expects "more than a few" people will be deposed under oath.
 "No one is off limits," he said.
 Celli plans to make the list of subpoenas and depositions publicly available when it's complete, he said. At the end of what Celli expects to be a three- month investigation, the final report will be made public as well as transcripts of the depositions.
 The independent investigation will not focus on street-level police practices, Celli said, but specifically on the governmental processes after the interaction between police and Prude.
 The City Council authorized the independent investigation this week, tasking Celli's law firm, Emery, Celli, Brinkerhoff, Abady, Ward & Maazel LLP, with determining what happened within the city's agencies after Prude's death in late March.
 Earlier this week, the city released more than 300 pages of internal communications, police reports and other documents that show a concerted effort by police and city officials to control the narrative around Prude's death in custody and delay the release of police body camera footage of his interaction with police.
 Celli told reporters Friday that his team will dig deeper. His team will likely coordinate with the New York Attorney General's office where there's overlap between investigations, according to Celli. New York Attorney General Letitia James announced September 5 that she's empaneling a grand jury to investigate Prude's death.

“It is not just about stocks reaching Leh. Its about the rations and other essentials reaching the forward areas where troops are deployed. It is underway in full swing. Then there is also storage. Stocks cannot be left out in the open. There are limitations of storage space with additional stocks coming in. They are also being created,” the defence source said. In Leh, heavy snowing occurs by the end of November, so there is still some time, the source stated.
 Frosting has already started in many places and any stagnant water gets frozen at night. Temperatures have already dipped to minus zero degrees Centigrade in super high altitude areas, the source added.
 The two major road axis used by the Army for sending supplies to Leh are Zojila and Rohtang. Rohtang gets blocked by the end of October, while Zojila can continue till mid-November. The routes are being kept open longer than normal, a senior Army officer had stated earlier.
 After that, it will be only air maintenance using Indian Air Force C-17 and IL-76 transport aircraft to move loads to Leh, and helicopters to deliver them to forward locations. The logistical management needs careful planning so that supplies to high altitude areas in other sectors is not affected, the source said.

Esta semana en Cantillana las restricciones a causa de la pandemia de COVID-19 han limitado los actos festivos y los cultos que en circunstancias normales hubiera celebrado la hermandad de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. La hermandad “ha venido trabajando incansablemente y buscando alternativas para la celebración de los Actos de la Fiesta de la Subida”, según ha explicado en un comunicado. Por ello, y a pesar de ser unos días atípicos, la semana culminará con la Subida de la Virgen a su altar.Si bien, y según ha explicado la hermandad, hasta la mañana de este viernes “se han estado estudiando todas las posibilidades que resultaran más beneficiosas para el mayor lucimiento de las mismas, dentro de la piedad y devoción con la que los asuncionistas honramos a Nuestra Madre, la Asunción Gloriosa”. En este sentido, “se han tenido que obtener los correspondientes permisos civiles y eclesiásticos” para poder llevar a cabo los actos y celebraciones con todas las garantías.Atrás ha quedado la Exaltación de las fiestas de la Subida, un acto celebrado en la plaza de toros de la localidad y que se llevó a cabo en doble sesión – miércoles y jueves – para dar cabida a la demanda de entrada de los hermanos.Este año no se han instalado las casetas en el real asuncionista de la Alameda, ni se ha llevado a cabo la ofrenda de flores en moto al simpecado – aunque de forma espontánea los devotos han ofrecido las flores en la puerta de la parroquia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción y en la de la ermita de San Bartolomé -, ni las carreras de motos que habitualmente el jueves de esta semana se celebran en una multitudinaria concentración. La corte designada para las fiestas de la Subida ha sido prorrogada para el próximo año, por lo que tampoco se ha celebrado el acto de coronación, que se hubiera llevado a cabo este viernes. A pesar de ello, no han faltado los adornos en las calles, los cohetes ni las tracas en estos días.La de este sábado hubiera sido una mañana de caballos y carreras de cintas en la avenida de Nuestra Señora de la Soledad. Acto popular que no se llevará a cabo. Sin embargo, los asuncionistas podrán visitar a la Virgen en la parroquia de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción. El templo permanecerá abierto de forma ininterrumpida desde las 11.00 hasta las 20.00 horas para que los hermanos y devotos puedan postrarse ante la Virgen.Ya en la noche del sábado, a las 22.00 horas se rezará el Santo Rosario en la ermita de San Bartolomé, ante el monumento asuncionista. Según ha informado la hermandad, los misterios serán cantados por el coro flamenco de la hermandad, incluyéndose tras cada uno de ellos una composición musical dedicada a la titular de la hermandad.El domingo se abrirá a las 10.00 horas con la Santa Misa de romeros, que se oficiará en el mismo lugar, ante el monumento del Dogma Asuncionista, y acompañada por el coro flamenco. La eucaristía culminará con el rezo del Ángelus.Para la asistencia al Rosario como a la Santa Misa de Romeros es necesario inscribirse mediante el formulario difundido a través de la página de Facebook de la hermandad. Según explica la corporación, “para garantizar que puedan participar el máximo número de hermanos y hermanas posible”, dadas las limitaciones de aforo, “solo podrá realizarse la inscripción a uno de los dos cultos”.Tanto en la parroquia como en todos los cultos y actos previstos, y “dadas las circunstancias tan especiales en que nos encontramos”, la hermandad ha señalado en la circular dirigida a los hermanos que es “fundamental el uso de mascarillas y mantener la distancia de seguridad establecida en la legislación vigente”.La culminación de estos cultos y actos especiales tendrá lugar el domingo a partir de las 20.00 horas, cuando dará comienzo el acto de Subida, que rememora la Asunción al cielo. La Virgen subirá hasta su altar desde el sepulcro, escoltada por coros de ángeles – formados por las niñas asuncionistas – que lanzan pétalos de rosa a la imagen. Debido a las circunstancias ya más que conocidas, este año serán menos las niñas que participen en el acto, para poder guardar las distancias, reservado a hermanas con edades comprendidas entre 9 y 13 años. El acceso a la parroquia para participar en este acto, mediante inscripción previa, ha sido reservado principalmente a hermanos y hermanas mayores de 75 años. El resto de hermanos podrá seguirlo desde la pantalla que se instalará en el exterior del templo. Igualmente, la Subida de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción como el resto de actos programados para el fin de semana serán retransmitidos en directo a través del canal de YouTube de la hermandad.A la finalización del acto, la parroquia volverá a abrir sus puertas para exponer a la Virgen a la veneración de los devotos. Culminarán así unas fiestas de la Subida distintas, adaptadas a las circunstancias y a las limitaciones impuestas por esta nueva normalidad, pero vividas con el mismo fervor y devoción hacia la Asunción de la Virgen.

 # Snow Fire grows to 4,500 acres as evacuation orders remain
 Christopher Damien
 Palm Springs Desert Sun
 View Comments
 The Snow Fire continued to burn in an area north of Palm Springs between Cabazon and Whitewater south of Interstate 10 in the San Jacinto Wilderness, growing to 4,500 acres Saturday morning, Cal Fire officials said.
 Cal Fire Capt. Fernando Herrera said the fire's progress slowed overnight and several spot fires among the ridge are under control.
 "A lot of the work done yesterday to put fire retardant lines and slow its growth to the east and the west, have been successful," Herrera said.
 The fire's location in the windy San Gorgonio Pass is a concern for firefighters, as winds could gust up to 30 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
 Hand crews will focus their efforts Saturday deep in the canyons, Herrera said, while air tankers will concentrate on the fire's active edge higher up the mountain's ridge.
 The good news for residents is that the smoke has dissipated a bit, Herrera said, the air is cleaner and evacuation orders will be reassessed throughout the day.
 Residents living in the Snow Creek area north of Cottonwood, southeast of Snowcreek Canyon Road and west of Falls Creek were evacuated on Thursday. Authorities issued an evacuation warning to residents of Windy Point and two nearby mobile home parks.
 Firefighters were dispatched to the area of the 15900 block of Snow Creek Road Thursday afternoon. California Highway Patrol officials said they received reports that a Ford work truck caught fire in that area around the same time as the wildfire was reported. Cal Fire is still investigating the cause.

On Friday, HBO Max announced the third season renewal of DC Universe's original animated series _Harley Quinn_. The show won't return until at least late 2021, but fans should expect the whole crew to be along for the ride when it does. Speaking to _ComicBook.com_ , the series' showrunners say they don't expect any of the show's voice actors to depart before the next season debuts. "If so, we are unaware of that," Patrick Schumacker says. "But everybody, from what we can tell, was really pleased with how everything turned out. The way that animation works, it's interesting and also a little bit terrifying at times, because it's not like live-action where you're locking people with contracts for many years before they get cast in the show. It's just done on an episode by episode basis. It's just, 'Hey, are you available?' But, at the same time, the time commitment is so different than in live-action that oftentimes, unless it's a completely terrible experience for someone, they're generally pretty receptive to coming back. So no one has explicitly told us that they will not be returning to the show."
 Justin Halpern notes that if someone doesn't show up again in the next season, that was their choice and not because they were written out of the story, "If you see somebody who's no longer in the show that didn't die in an episode, that means they didn't want to come back," he says.
 Despite his betrayal in the show's second season, _Harley Quinn_ will even carve out a new role for Doctor Psycho, voiced by Tony Hale. "We love Doctor psycho," Schumacher says. "We love Tony Hale. We want Doctor Psycho to come back. But obviously, after what happened in season two, making him part of the crew still seems like a nonstarter. Figuring out ways to continue to incorporate him into the storylines, and is he someone who will be like the Hannibal Lecter character as a dark mentor behind bars to Harley and Ivy as they navigate their way through the story of season three, was one thought that we had. So yeah, we really want to get him back in the story."
 The main cast of _Harley Quinn_ includes Kaley Cuoco as Harley Quinn, Lake Bell as Poison Ivy, Alan Tudyk as Clayface, Tony Hale as Doctor Psycho, Ron Funches as King Shark, Jason Alexander as Sy Borgman, and J. B. Smoove as Frank the Plant. Harley Quinn's first two seasons are streaming now on HBO Max.

L’assessore alle Attività Produttive (con delega alle Politiche sportive) Francesco Cupparo sottolinea che “l’intenso lavoro degli uffici del Dipartimento consente di erogare l’aiuto previsto alla vigilia della ripresa dell’attività sportiva che auspichiamo possa avvenire, nel rispetto delle norme di sicurezza Covid-19, quanto più vicino alla normalità. Avevamo assunto l’impegno di velocizzare l’iter dell’Avviso e l’impegno di spesa che ad oggi è già vicino al 50% di quello totale (1 milione di euro) mi sembra un buon risultato a testimonianza dell’attenzione della Giunta per il mondo dello sport, giovani, tecnici e dirigenti di associazioni, famiglie che hanno dovuto interrompere ogni attività a causa dell’emergenza sanitaria Covid-19 e sono fortemente impegnati per la ripresa delle attività. La nostra realtà sportiva regionale è costituita da decine di associazioni che svolgono un ruolo insostituibile ai fini educativi, del benessere, dell’inclusione sociale e del turismo. Si tratta di enti che sopravvivono grazie alla passione, all’impegno, al sacrificio. Bisogna, quindi arricchire l’offerta finanziando tutte quelle attività sportive e strutture impiantistiche che, oltre alla loro funzione principale, possono diventare luoghi di spettacolo e di intrattenimento”.
