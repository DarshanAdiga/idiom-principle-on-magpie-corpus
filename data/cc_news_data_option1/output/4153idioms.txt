Amazon's 2020 Prime Day comes as the company and its big tech peers remain under scrutiny following a congressional investigation over antitrust concerns. Amazon specifically was in the spotlight over its treatment of third-party sellers. Some former sellers told lawmakers that the company has released new products through its private-label that appear almost identical to theirs. The House concluded that Amazon uses third-party seller data to copy the most popular products listed on the online marketplace, according to a report detailing lawmakers' findings.
 The investigation isn't the first time that Amazon has been accused of scraping third-party data. Employees spoke out in 2019 regarding how easily Amazon can access sellers' data and share it with its retail team.
 The annual Prime Day event is typically held in July but was delayed to mid- October in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a new filing by an Amazon employee -- who is already suing the company over poor work conditions -- Amazon, in an effort to expedite operations during Prime Day, reinstated a policy allowing managers to discipline employees who take time to wash their hands and sanitize.

LANSING -- Michigan's Republican-led Legislature on Wednesday voted to keep intact longer-lasting unemployment benefits and other coronavirus-related orders issued by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, while also striking a deal on liability protections for businesses.
   
 The move followed a monthlong fight over the governor's unilateral measures to control the pandemic after lawmakers refused to extend her emergency declaration last spring. The state Supreme Court this month declared unconstitutional a 75-year-old law that had underpinned Whitmer's restrictions.
   
 The unemployment measure was among several approved during a lengthy session that began Tuesday and did not end until after 3 a.m. Businesses, health providers and others who are sued over COVID-19 infections would be more shielded from lawsuits, as long as they comply with all safety rules. Under another bill, employers could not discharge, discipline or retaliate against employees who stay home when they or their close contacts are sick.
   
 The Oct. 2 high court ruling means Whitmer's emergency declaration and underlying orders are no longer in effect. Her administration quickly reinstated mask requirements, business capacity restrictions and other regulations under a public health law.
   
 But the court decision forced her to work with the GOP-controlled Legislature on some issues.
   
 Republicans and their allies in the business community said the immunity legislation was necessary to stop frivolous pandemic-related suits. A group representing plaintiff's attorneys said it successfully lobbied to remove the "most harmful provisions," including those that would have barred lawsuits unless a person had minimum symptoms or if the employer had substantially complied with safety guidelines.
   
 The Michigan Association for Justice "steadfastly maintained our objections to any form of immunity while at the same time ensuring that any immunity that might be passed be as restrictive as possible," president Donna MacKenzie said.
   
 Other measures sent to the governor following hours of negotiations would codify her administration's recently announced changes related to the care of nursing home residents recovering from the virus, let public bodies continue to meet electronically, and extend renewal dates for driver's licenses and vehicle registrations. A nursing home could be a designated "care and recovery" center only if it had a federal staffing rating of at least three out of five stars and the staff were solely dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients.
   
 Nursing home residents account for 30% of Michigan deaths that have been tied to the virus.
   
 "I think people are concerned that, up until now, their elected officials who are their voice in Lansing have not had input into these orders. As we move forward, I'm pleased the Legislature will have a seat at the table in crafting important decisions that affect our districts and constituents each and every day," said Republican Rep. Annette Glenn of Midland.
   
 The sponsor of the unemployment bill, Republican Sen. Ken Horn of Frankenmuth, said it would ensure that people out of work during the pandemic see no interruption in benefits. Whitmer last spring extended the maximum length of state payments from 20 to 26 weeks, and made other unemployment changes.
   
 The jobless can receive additional payments from the federal government once they exhaust their state benefits.
   
 The provisions in the unemployment bill would remain in place through Dec. 31.
   
 "It's good the Legislature took a step forward to provide immediate, temporary relief for families, but the bills just kick the can down the road and the Legislature needs to take further action to make this permanent," Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said.

Reinforcing its long-standing partnership, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR recently teamed up with the Spanish counterpart of Telefonica, S.A. TEF to ensure a secure mobile infrastructure for its growing 5G network. Markedly, the telco will capitalize on Juniper’s avant-garde security solutions to combat the rising incidences of network threats while fostering dynamic connectivity. The contract, which is considered to be a significant win, underscores Juniper’s efforts in establishing a streamlined infrastructure supported by best-in-class network performance, especially at a time when majority of the network operators are migrating toward automated connectivity solutions.      As part of the collaboration, Telefonica Spain will leverage Juniper’s Security Gateway (SecGW) platform to create a future-proof network ecosystem with a secured 5G mobile backhaul network. The SecGW platform consists of industry-leading solutions, which are primarily known for implementing high- performance security with an integrated threat intelligence system — one of them being SRX series firewalls. In particular, Telefonica will deploy Juniper’s SRX5800 Services Gateway, which is a next-gen security platform. The solution mainly caters to large organizations and public sector networks with improved performance and scalability. It includes both virtual and containerized firewalls, which enable the solution to seamlessly penetrate into the telco cloud infrastructure.      Apart from SRX5800, Juniper will simplify Telefonica’s network operations with various other solutions. Some of them are third-generation Services Processing Card, which is used to address the high-bandwidth requirements for large scale 5G deployments, and fourth-generation Input Output Cards that offers multiple connectivity options ranging from 10Gbps Ethernet to 100Gbps Ethernet. On the back of these revolutionary features, Telefonica Spain will be able to streamline operations with Juniper’s AutoVPN feature, deploy carrier-class platform for a protected backhaul network, support services like Unified Threat Management, Application Security and minimize capital and operational overheads.      It is worth mentioning that Juniper and Telefonica have been working for a while now to encourage flexible 5G deployments. The companies have apparently collaborated for a project, dubbed Fusion Network. This three-year program has been specifically designed to merge legacy networks into a single platform that will help in simplifying operations with network automation. With a unique combination of Juniper’s technical assistance and Telefonica’s on- premises proactive support, the project aims to meet the growing demand for IoT, 5G and cloud services with an enhanced end-user experience. Notably, the latest deployment drive will not only boost Juniper’s low-latency security platforms but also strengthen Telefonica’s technological transformation strategy, thereby creating a win-win situation for both the companies.      The Sunnyvale, CA-based networking vendor anticipates its business to grow on the back of product portfolio strength led by coveted solution offerings for enterprise customers. It aims to leverage the growing demand for data center virtualization, cloud computing and mobile traffic packet/optical convergence. With increasing usage of smartphones and tablets, mobile data traffic has surged, leading to higher demand for advanced networking architecture. Impressively, Juniper has made significant changes to its go-to-market structure to better align sales strategies with each of its core customer verticals. It is also planning to introduce several products over the next few quarters, which are expected to augment its competitive position across cloud and enterprise markets.      Despite such diligent execution of operational activities, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) firm have lost 4.4% against the industry’s growth of 26.1% in the past year. It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8%.

The Kildare senior management last week announced their revised panel for the two remaining Alliance Football League games, both at home, against Cavan and Westmeath.   Kildare resume, all going well and behind closed of course, this Sunday at St Conleth's Park with the final game, against Westmeath the following Saturday.   There are two things that spring to mind when looking at the new panel and comparing to the one announced prior to the commencement of the league.   One is that in total 12 players have departed the panel for various and varied reasons.   The second observation being that while there are lads returning now who were not available back at the start of the season, there is in reality, just three new faces.   Of the lads omitted Peter Kelly and David Slattery, two players who have given great service have retired, a few lads have stepped away and a few more simply did not make the cut.   Of the lads returning who had gone abroad but returned due to the dreaded corona virus, all are to be welcomed and are big additions.   Sarsfields' Ben McCormack, Matty Byrne and Moorefield's Mark Dempsey all back in, having cut short their plans.   In reality there are just three new faces on the new squad and even at that Eanna O'Connor has been there before, hopefully his experience this time around will be better managed and allow him to show his undoubted talent.   Daragh Ryan of Sarsfields inclusion is to be welcomed, a lad with lots of pace and not short of talent while Daragh Kirwan (Naas) somewhat of a surprise considering so few 'new' faces included but nonetheless a player that certainly has the potential and one who will only benefit from the experience of being part of the set-up.   Fergal Conway, one of the most consistent players for The Lilies over the past few seasons returns, remember he missed all five league games in this league due to injury so it is a real bonus to have him back fit and well; Aaron Masterson also missed the league.   Athy’s Niall Kelly who underwent an operation on his achilles tendon last week, an injury picked up in the SFC final, is a huge loss, both personally himself and to the county. He has enjoyed a great championship, scoring at will and tormenting defences on every occasion. Hopefully Niall will be back sooner rather than later , we wish him well in his recovery.   Two exciting players included but must be regarded as doubtful for this weekend at least, are Daniel Flynn and Jack Robinson. The Johnstownbridge man played in the SFC semi final but did not look right with that infamous hamstring injury niggling him again, while the exciting Jack Robinson's inclusion, one would imagine, would be more for championship duty in a few weeks time rather than for these two upcoming League games. The Clogherinkoe man missed the IFC final, another hamstring injury, so it is highly unlikely he would be asked just yet to line-out, but hopefully we will see him later.   Of course this is a season like no other and while, all going well, the two league games will be played over the next two weekends before The Lilies go into action in the Leinster Championship two weeks after that in the quarter final l (November 8) with successful teams playing consecutive weeks after that, remembering of course this time around it will be straight knock-out, no back door and no Super 8s, just like it use to be in years gone by.

The Barrington authors have embraced a false dichotomy that lets our public health system off the hook. Controlling the pandemic isn't a choice between "lockdowns" and letting the virus rage to achieve herd immunity.
 Countries that crushed the virus, like South Korea and New Zealand, didn't pursue either of those strategies. They tested, contact traced, and shared information with their citizens that helped those citizens minimize the outbreak.
 "We've got to get a testing regime and a contact tracing regime in place, we've got to get the PPE available, and widespread, and we did none of that -- and that's the problem," public health expert Ezekiel Emanuel told Insider, after he published a research letter in the medical journal JAMA earlier this week showing how inferior the public health response to the virus was in the US compared to many other rich countries.
 "Schools can open, and lots of other things can happen when the transmission rate is very, very low," he said. "And that's what we failed to do."
