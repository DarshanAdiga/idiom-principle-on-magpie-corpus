Jacksonville lost but won if it manages to lose the last two and finish with the first pick in the draft. If that happens, Trevor Lawrence will be headed to Jacksonville instead of New York to play for the Jets. The Jaguars have a 13-game losing streak since defeating Indianapolis in their opener. The Ravens elevated their record to 9-5 with a third consecutive victory. Baltimore shut down the Jaguars' running game, limiting James Robinson to 35 yards on 16 carries. Jacksonville ran 22 times for 62 yards, a 2.8-yard average. Gardner Minshew II, back at quarterback for at least two more games, completed 22 of 29 for 225 yards and two touchdowns. He had a 120.8 rating, but most of his completions were short because the Ravens were playing it safe after jumping to a decisive lead. Former Jaguars' defensive end Yannick Ngakoue led the Ravens' pass rush with two of their five sacks. Lamar Jackson, who threw for 243 yards and three touchdowns, helped the Ravens go five for five in the red zone. His rating was 133.1. Baltimore finished with 159 yards rushing and dominated the line of scrimmage.

Cette variante représente actuellement environ 60% des nouvelles infections en Grande-Bretagne. Elle a aussi été repérée ailleurs, notamment aux Pays-Bas et en Belgique. Avec ce type de virus, "il est tout à fait normal que des variantes circulent", ajoute le porte-parole. Certaines peuvent apparaître brièvement, d'autres se propagent plus rapidement et deviennent dominantes, comme c'est le cas outre-Manche. L'expert cite deux hypothèses: soit elle profite de nos contacts sociaux et nos comportements, soit il s'agit d'une variante qui se transmet plus facilement. "La contagiosité augmentée est possible mais pas encore certaine", indique Yves Van Laethem. "Elle semble avoir un avantage potentiel pour entrer dans la cellule mais cela doit encore être démontré sur le plan biologique." Sa détection au Royaume-Uni est aussi sans doute due au fait que le pays compte un des systèmes de recherche génétique et de surveillance "les plus complets et les plus performants au monde", ajoute le porte-parole. Le Royaume-Uni teste en effet en permanence 5 à 10% des échantillons de virus retrouvés chez des patients pour déterminer leurs codes génétiques. En comparaison, la Belgique fait ce travail sur 0,5% de ses souches, soit 3.300 souches sur 600.000 déterminées jusqu'à présent. La période est propice à la propagation des infections respiratoires, rappelle encore Yves Van Laethem. Il est important d'adhérer aux mesures et de ne pas voyager vers les zones rouges. (Belga)

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], December 21 (ANI): Despite India stumbling to an eight-wicket loss in the first Test of the four-match series against Australia, former pacer Zaheer Khan has listed a number of positives for the visiting side and feels that the side has learned from that experience.
 On Saturday, India was bundled out for 36 in the second innings of the pink- ball Test and Australia was given a mediocre target of 90 runs. Australia chased down the total comfortably inside 21 overs with eight wickets in hand.
 According to the veteran speedster, India displayed confidence as they named their playing XI a day before the game and added that Virat Kohli-led side also batted well barring the second innings.
 "The first positive for India was that the playing XI was announced a day before. I feel it was a big positive because you showed confidence in the playing XI," Zaheer said on the Sony Sports Network.
 "The second positive was opting to bat after winning the toss. You showed that however good an attack Australia may have, we will play according to the conditions. The first day was very good. Pujara and Virat Kohli had set a platform although we may have fallen short by 40-50 runs of the number of runs that should have been scored.
 "Bowling made a very good comeback. There were problems about length at the start, even the Australian bowlers had that issue in the first innings. India learnt from that," he added.
 Zaheer went on and lauded spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for his 4/55 in the first innings at the Adelaide Oval.
 "Ashwin was another positive as you want your main spinner to play a good role in these conditions, get the breakthroughs. He got Smith out and picked up three wickets during that period. He overall took four wickets in the first innings," he said.
 Kohli will miss the rest of the series for India as he will return home after being granted paternity leave by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). Rahane is set to take on the role of stand-in captain in the remaining three games of the series.
 India will also be without the services of pacer Mohammad Shami as he has been ruled out of the series after suffering a fracture on his arm as reported by ANI on Saturday.
 He retired hurt while batting in the second innings at the Adelaide Oval on Saturday after he was hit on the right arm by a bouncer from Pat Cummins.
 Speaking to ANI, sources in the know of developments said that the terrible pain was a result of the fracture he sustained.
 "Yes, he has a fracture and that is why he could not grip the bat and lift it at the crease. It looked bad and the worst fear has come true," the source had said.
 India and Australia will lock horns in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, beginning December 26. (ANI)

LOWER MERION -- After discussions at multiple public meetings dating back to this past summer, Lower Merion officials have approved their final 2021 budget. And for the 10th consecutive year, there is no increase in the property tax rate.
 But because township officials are using money from its fund balance to balance the projected $7 million deficit, they may not have a choice but to increase taxes in the coming years.
 The Lower Merion Board of Commissioners at its most recent meeting approved its final 2021 budget, keeping its millage tax rate at 4.19. One mill represents $1 for every $1,000 of a property’s assessed value.

Gold witnessed a dramatic intraday turnaround from six-week tops amid resurgent USD demand. Fresh COVID-19 jitters offset news of additional US stimulus measures and boosted the greenback. A turnaround in the global risk sentiment benefitted the safe-haven metal and helped limit losses. Gold quickly reversed a mid-European session dip to three-day lows and is currently placed in the neutral territory, just below the $1885 level. The precious metal witnessed an intraday turnaround and tumbled over $50 from daily swing highs near the $1906-07 region, or six-week tops touched earlier this Monday. The sharp fall was exclusively sponsored by a strong pickup in the US dollar demand, which tends to undermine demand for the dollar- denominated commodity. The news that the US Congress reached a deal on a long- awaited $900 billion US COVID-19 relief package was overshadowed by worries about the rapidly spreading new strain of COVID-19 in the UK. This, in turn, provided a strong boost to the greenback status as the global reserve currency and exerted pressure on the XAU/USD. Renewed coronavirus jitters, along with a deadlock in the post-Brexit trade negotiations, took its toll on the global risk sentiment. This was evident from a steep fall in the equity markets, which extended some support to the safe-haven precious metal and helped limit any further losses, at least for the time being. The XAU/USD attracted some dip-buying near the $1855 region and was last seen hovering around the $1883-84 region, nearly unchanged for the day. In the absence of any major market-moving economic releases from the US, the broader market risk sentiment and the USD price dynamics might continue to influence the commodity. Technical levels to watch XAU/USD Overview Today last price 1878.5 Today Daily Change -2.80 Today Daily Change % -0.15 Today daily open 1881.3 Trends Daily SMA20 1835.31 Daily SMA50 1871.17 Daily SMA100 1905.34 Daily SMA200 1814.82 Levels Previous Daily High 1889.78 Previous Daily Low 1877.47 Previous Weekly High 1896.3 Previous Weekly Low 1819.08 Previous Monthly High 1965.58 Previous Monthly Low 1764.6 Daily Fibonacci 38.2% 1882.17 Daily Fibonacci 61.8% 1885.08 Daily Pivot Point S1 1875.92 Daily Pivot Point S2 1870.54 Daily Pivot Point S3 1863.61 Daily Pivot Point R1 1888.23 Daily Pivot Point R2 1895.16 Daily Pivot Point R3 1900.54

Jerusalem, Dec 21 (PTI) India and Israel on Monday signed an agreement to cooperate in the fields of health and medicine, including sharing of expertise in building climate resilient infrastructure and support to 'green healthcare'.
 The agreement was signed between Israel's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Gabi Ashkenazi, and India's Ambassador to Israel, Sanjeev Singla, on behalf of the Indian government.
 The new pact replaces the previous one signed in September 2003, a press statement said.
 Ashkenazi expressed satisfaction on the ongoing cooperation between the two countries, underlining the joint efforts in dealing with COVID-19.
 India has lost 1,45,810 lives to COVID-19, with over 10 million confirmed infections, according to its health ministry. The coronavirus has claimed 3,109 lives in Israel.
 Ashkenazi emphasised on further strengthening cooperation in the sector of water management. The new agreement includes sharing of expertise for facilitating climate resilient infrastructure, as well as providing support for development of "green healthcare", i.e. climate resilient hospitals.
 "In the wake of our ongoing cooperation on COVID-19, this agreement strengthens our existing cooperation in health and medicine. In particular, we look to deepening our efforts on digital health and medical devices," Singla told PTI.
 The agreement will expedite cooperation in exchange and training of medical doctors and other health professionals, assistance in development of human resources, and setting up of health care facilities.
 It will also facilitate the exchange of information regarding regulation of pharmaceutical, medical devices and cosmetics.
 The two countries have also committed to share their expertise for vulnerability assessment for health of citizens against climate risk and public health actions targeted towards mitigation and adaptation, as well as facilitating climate resilient infrastructure (hospitals) promoting "green healthcare".
 The agreement pushes to promote mutual research in various areas of relevance and also encourages the participation of representatives from both countries in round tables, seminars, symposia, workshops and conferences on issues of cooperation.
 Minister Ashkenazi emphasised on international collaborations to strengthen the health, economic and tourism sectors.
 "I just signed two bilateral agreements with India and Vietnam in the fields of health and aviation. These agreements will strengthen cooperation in a variety of areas, promote professional collaborations and assist in the development of public health, trade and tourism," the Israeli minister tweeted.
 "The pandemic has caused a global economic crisis. Even though there is a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccination programme, we must continue to strengthen international collaborations to prepare our health, economic and tourism sectors for the day after COVID-19," he wrote.

Rome, Dec 21 (AP) Pope Francis urged Vatican bureaucrats on Monday to stop their gossipy, self-absorbed conflicts, issuing another tough-love Christmas message at the end of a year marked by the coronavirus pandemic and a financial scandal at the Holy See.
 Francis gathered his cardinals, bishops and Vatican prelates for his annual Christmas greeting in the Clementine Hall of the Apostolic Palace.
 In past years, Francis has used the occasion to deliver a brutal dressing-down of the clerical court that surrounds the papacy, once denouncing the "spiritual Alzheimer's" of some Holy See clerics.
 This year, Francis said conflicts in the church between left and right, progressives and traditionalists, only hurt the church and distort its true nature.
 "For this reason, it would be good for us to stop living in conflict and feel once more that we are journeying together," Francis said.
 He stressed that "crisis" isn't the same as "conflict," with crises in the church offering an opportunity for renewal but conflicts just "a waste of energy and occasion for evil."
 "The first evil that conflict leads us to, and which we must try to avoid, is gossip, idle chatter, which traps us in an unpleasant, sad and stifling state of self-absorption," he said. "It turns crisis into conflict."
 Like the rest of the world, the Vatican's 2020 was marked by a lockdown that grounded the globe-trotting pope, canceled his weekly appointments with the faithful and shuttered the Vatican Museums, the Holy See's main source of revenue.
 Those pastoral and financial setbacks have been compounded by a scandal over the Holy See's bungled 350 million euro investment in a London real estate venture that is now the subject of a corruption investigation.
 The scandal, which has been fueled by leaks from within, has exposed divisive turf wars within the hierarchy and has led to the downfall of a high-ranking cardinal, among other casualties.
 Francis asked that the church not be judged on the crises of the past or present.
 "If a certain realism leads us to see our recent history only as a series of mishaps, scandals and failings, sins and contradictions, short-circuits and setbacks in our witness, we should not fear," he said. Instead, he said, such crises require an openness to change and discern a way forward. (AP)

Karachi [Pakistan], December 21 (ANI): Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday announced that the women's team is all set to attend the training camp which commences on Tuesday for next month's South Africa tour after 26 players and 12 officials returned their second negative Covid-19 results.
 "A player, presently out of the country, and an official will join the camp later in the week after returning the two mandatory negative tests. Separately, a player has been advised a further week's rest so that she can completely recover after an anti-bodies test revealed she had recently recuperated from Covid-19," PCB said in a statement.
 Pakistan will tour South Africa to play three ODIs and as many T20Is, starting on January 20.
 Durban will host the first ODI on January 20 and the third T20I on February 3. Both matches will be played under lights. Durban will also stage the second ODI on January 23 before the action moves to Pietermaritzburg where the third ODI and opening two T20Is will be played on January 26, 29 and 31 respectively.
 The tour to South Africa will also be the first official assignment of head coach David Hemp and bowling coach Arshad Khan. While Hemp joined forces in October, Arshad was appointed in November. Mohammad Kamran Hussain will be the assistant coach at the training camp.
 This will be Pakistan women's side's second tour to South Africa within 18 months. In May 2019, Pakistan and South Africa played three ICC Women's Championship ODIs which ended in a 1-1 draw. While in the five-match T20I series, Pakistan took a 2-1 lead before South Africa bounced back to clinch the series 3-2. (ANI)
