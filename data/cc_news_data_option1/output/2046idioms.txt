“I think we’ll have fans in the stands,” Bowlsby said. “When you think about how difficult it is to do hospital-level disinfecting in a weight room or locker room or a training room, think about doing it for an entire stadium – the entryways, the lines at the restrooms, the lines at the concessions stands, sitting that far apart in the stands. It’s a very large undertaking.”
 Make no doubt that the nation’s sports fans are bordering up demanding sports to be played, be it with or without crowds, for there is a national fascination with these games, one that sometimes is difficult to understand.
 In 2006 the Society for Psychological Science published a study that reached some intriguing conclusions over why fans become so emotionally attached to sports and teams.
 “People are tying up a lot of who they are in their identity as a fan of X-team,” said Edward Hirt, an associate professor of psychological and brain sciences at Indiana University. “A huge part of who they are, where they derive a lot of their positive and negative affect, is from what their team is doing.”
 In some ways this may seem crazy but it can be explained.
 “It’s a voluntary activity where half of the people aren’t going to like the product when they’ve finished consuming it,” Wann said, an academic way of translating the age-old adage “You win some, you lose some.”
 “You wouldn’t go to a movie if you thought there was a 50/50 chance you won’t like it,” he added.
 And, as much as movies are today, they don’t touch the price of tickets for most sporting events.
 Sports differ from TV shows or movies in that there is always a strong element of the unexpected, of the upset or of the heroic late-game effort that produces victory.
 Who will win? Who will lose? Who will be the star? Who will be the goat? And you don’t often see movie fans second-guessing the scriptwriter, but a coach and his decisions on how to manipulate the plot of a game is certainly nothing less than a hot dog ready to be grilled.
 Sports fans aren’t there to watch the action, they become part of it, from the pregame tailgating ritual to the attire they wear to the game, to their cheers and jeers and to their long conversation after the game that carries all the way until they read about what they saw the next day in the paper or online.
 Football without fans doesn’t get it, neither does basketball without fans and the other sports reach their highest level without fans.
 Think of it this way. It’s hard to “Stripe the Stadium” or have “Gold Rush” if there’s no one there to pull it off, so let’s just do the right thing and play the games when it’s safe to include fans into the stadiums to add the excitement that the games scream out for.

While it is a given, that most vegetables (and fruits!) are best cooked and consumed fresh, not all frozen produce is bad. The case for fresh peas is that they're fresh, and you don't have to worry about the brand, or what's added in it. However, the downside is that it's laborious and time-consuming to shell peas, especially in this day and age of reduced domestic help, and more household chores.

An ambulance then arrives and he is put in
 The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has joined the FBI in its investigation.
 All body camera footage has been turned over to the BCA, which investigates most police shootings and in-custody deaths.
 The officers involved have been put on paid administrative leave, per department protocol.
 Nekima Levy-Armstrong, a prominent local activist, said watching the footage that was shared on social media made her 'sick to her stomach' and called the incident another example of police brutality toward African American men, the Star Tribune reported.
 'Whatever the man may have done should not have ended in a death sentence,' she said.
 'What started as an alleged economic incident once again turned deadly for a black man.'
 Levy-Armstrong said the incident reminded her of the Eric Garner case.
 He was an unarmed New York man who died in 2014 after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life saying he couldn't breathe.
 A grand jury later decided against indicting the officers involved, sparking protests around the country.
 Police in Minneapolis have come under the microscope in recent years for deadly run-ins with citizens.
 A 24-year-old black man, Jamar Clark, was shot in the head and died in 2015 after a confrontation with two white officers responding to a reported assault.
 A county prosecutor declined to prosecute the officers, saying Clark was struggling for one of the officers´ gun when he was shot.
 A white woman, Justine Rusczcyk Damond, died in 2017 when she was shot in the stomach by a Minneapolis officer responding to her 911 call.
 That officer, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter and murder and is serving a 12-year prison sentence.

The Sons of the American Legion never want anyone to forget what Memorial Day is about.
   
 "Memorial Day has seemed to turn into a three-day weekend, and it means more than that," said Squadron 82 Commander Jack Weller.
   
 On Saturday, dozens of people came out to Sunset and Webb Memorial cemeteries in Shelby to pay their respects to the more than 1,100 veterans buried between the two cemeteries. Members of the Sons of the American Legion remembered the sacrifices of the generations that came before them.
   
 Weller and the 30 other members of the Cleveland County chapter of the Sons of the American Legion are just that. They are sons of men and women who served in a branch of the military, but they didn't serve themselves.
   
 "For me it is a way to honor my father's military service," Weller said.
   
 After the short ceremony, people were asked to form small groups and maintain social distancing to help place flags at different graves. Many young men and women from Shelby High School athletics and Boy Scout troops in the county participated alongside members of the Shelby Masonic Lodge #744, the family of American Legion members, the American Legion Auxiliary, the Legion Riders and the Sons of the American Legion.
   
 Members of the Sons of American Legion and the other Legion groups intermingled with groups of the younger volunteers. Each shared stories from their past service or of the military service members in their past and why they continued to honor them.
   
 Weller is hopeful that they take a moment on Memorial Day to remember those we've lost.

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — George R.R. Martin, the famed author of the “Game of Thrones” fantasy series, has joined a group to buy the historic Santa Fe Southern Railroad. Violet Crown cinema owner Bill Banowsky, National Dance Institute of New Mexico co-founder Catherine Oppenheimer and Martin recently purchased the decades-old railway and trains along the 18-mile (29-kilometer) spur line from Santa Fe to the community of Lamy, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. Passenger excursion trains to Lamy ended in 2012 and some residents have been seeking ways to get them started again. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached Lamy in 1879. Though it had been initially planned to roll into Santa Fe, railroad executives and engineers said it would be too difficult to build a main track to the capital city because of the steep grade in the mountainous environment, so they settled for a spur line. The first Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe train to reach Santa Fe arrived in February 1880. The train served the city for well over a century. In 1991, the successor to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway closed the spur. The Santa Fe Southern Railway formed to buy the right of way, buildings, and equipment for the short-line operation. Oppenheimer said the trio did not want to see the financially challenged railway fall into further disrepair or fade away. “There’s something about train travel that brings you back to a time that we assume was a simpler, more community-based time, long before the internet, before air travel, even before television,” she said. Oppenheimer added the trio plan to ultimately provide “a super-fun train experience that builds in the history and culture and natural beauty of New Mexico.” Plans not only include repairing the track and...

Exide Life Insurance Company Ltd (Exide Life Insurance) has, in the wake of Covid-19-induced lockdown, put its ambitions of achieving ‘breakneck’ growth this fiscal on the back burner, said a top official.
 However, growth this will certainly remain on the agenda of the two-decade-old private life insurer this fiscal and it would be segmented, Kshitij Jain, Managing Director and CEO, Exide Life Insurance told _BusinessLine_.
 “Our long-term plan was to grow at twice the pace of industry, thereby gaining market share. That was the plan till March 15 this year. However, post Covid-19 lockdown, breakneck growth aspiration has been put on the back burner. Our growth aspiration has become a bit muted due to Covid-19,” he said.
 He highlighted that the entire industry focus has changed towards business continuity and serving existing customers better and managing existing books well. “Focus on quality, customer retention, and persistency has gone up measurably so that we can build the business and start pursuing growth aggressively when the market makes a turn and allows it,” he said.
 Jain said that he does not see any need for the company to raise capital this fiscal, given that it enjoyed comfortable solvency position and could fund growth through internal accruals. Also, Exide Life, which has remained profitable for over seven years consecutively, has no immediate plans to tap the capital markets for an IPO even though this was a shareholder call, Jain confirmed. In FY19, overall net profit doubled over the level of the previous fiscal.
 Exide Life Insurance, which is wholly-owned by Exide Industries, has an assets under management of about ₹16,000 crore. Jain said the life insurer has not lost a single day of work through the entire lockdown, but admitted that business had been hit in the first three weeks since March 15.
 ## Business lost
 Asked if Exide Life can make good the lost business of early part of this fiscal in the remaining 10 months, Jain replied in the negative.
 “Will I be able to make good the loss of business between March 15 and April 15, the answer is probably not. That would expect us to have a disproportionately high growth in the balance ten months, which I don’t think will happen. Some people are saying, life insurance industry is going to grow 15 to 20 per cent this fiscal. I don’t think so. I do believe the quality of growth we see this year is going to be superior to past.
 We (Exide Life) are seeing 100 per cent growth in protection products, which is the core of this industry. We are going to see large growth for traditional products, which has been the focus area of the company. Today, the share of traditional products in our overall product mix is 95 per cent – probably the highest in private life insurance industry,” he said.
 Exide Life proposes to continue its current approach of focus on traditional products with heightened push around protection portfolio, he said.
 “In last two years, we had been focussed on protection. Last year, more than 20 per cent of my customer acquisition happened through protection. This year in the first six weeks, 40 per cent has come via protection,” he said.
