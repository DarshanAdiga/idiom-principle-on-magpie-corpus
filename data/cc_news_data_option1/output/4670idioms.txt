Not happening, Not being considered.
 Crennel has been there, done that with taking over tear-downs and he is doing the organization a great service, again, by leading them through the remainder of this lost season, long ago doomed by outgoing coach/GM Bill O'Brien. But this is going to be a rebuild, there is an ongoing GM search, and that GM, along with ownership, will pick a coach. Anything else is pablum.
 This isn't an inside job and this won't be an inside job. Easterby's role remains to be seen.
 Crennel is one of the most beloved people in this game. Universally liked and respected. But that is a massive chore ahead for this floundering franchise and new ideas and fresh perspectives are badly in need. The defensive line needs a total overhaul, they are short of linebackers and the secondary is pretty bad, too. And they need a few starting offensive linemen and a running back and, by 2021, new receivers. Otherwise, yeah, just roll out the same team and keep the staff around and try to go 0-16 next year.

Im made a run at the lead when Johnson bobbled briefly on the front side, making back-to-back bogeys that sliced the lead to a single shot.
 But Johnson regained control with a birdie at the par-3 sixth, which turned into a two-shot swing when Im knocked his tee shot over the green, chipped to 4 feet and missed the tricky putt to take bogey.
 Smith, playing up ahead in the next-to-last threesome, brilliantly scrambled for birdies at the seventh and ninth holes, leaving him two behind at the turn.
 He never got any closer.
 “I knew I had to put the pressure on him early,” Smith said. “I got out of the gates pretty good. But D.J. was just too good at the end.”
 Smith struggled with his driver and long clubs, but his irons kept bailing him out.
 He made birdie at No. 7 by launching his second shot over a batch of towering pine trees. He pulled off another at the ninth, hitting a 9-iron off the pine straw that skidded past the bunkers to the left, curled onto the green and rolled down a ridge to about 4 feet from the flag.

In the early 1980s, the mathematical biologists Roy Anderson and Robert May, proposed that germs transmit best when hosts shed a lot of the pathogen, which may often mean when they are quite sick. If you’re really sick, you are—the argument goes—shedding lots of virus, which makes it easier for the next host to pick it up. So virulence and transmissibility go hand in hand, until the germ gets so deadly it winds up killing its host too soon, and therefore can’t spread at all. This is known as the transmission-virulence trade-off. The most familiar example is that of the myxoma virus, a pathogen introduced to Australia in 1950 to rid the country of rabbits. Initially, the virus killed more than 90 percent of Australian rabbits it infected. But over time, a tense truce developed: Rabbits evolved resistance, the myxoma germ declined in virulence, and both rabbits and germ remained in precarious balance for some time.

“It is heartbreaking to think that so many children don’t have that parental figure they can count on to be there for them,” Troutman said.


  Adopting an older child can take parents on the greatest roller coaster ride of their lives, Knodel said. Yet those she has worked with also found the experience richly rewarding.


  She recalled several families who hoped to adopt a child under the age of 10, but had a change of heart after seeing an older youth on the Pennsylvania’s Adoption Exchange website.


  “One such family recently had the opportunity to give their new daughter her first birthday party ever,” Knodel said. “It happened to be the youth’s 16th birthday.”


  Another family attended a matching event wanting to adopt a girl 6 years old or younger, she said. Yet, they walked away pursuing the adoption of a 16-year-old-boy who shared many of their interests.


  Although they are heroes to the older children they adopt, Knodel said, none of the parents she has worked with have super powers.


  “They are simply open to saying yes to a teenager,” she said.

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Amateur Andy Ogletree was getting ready to tee off in the Masters for the first time when his playing partner, a fellow U.S. Amateur champion, came up to introduce himself.
 Guy by the name of Tiger Woods.
 “Before I teed off, he kind of came up and embraced me and said, ‘Let’s go do this thing,’” Ogletree said Sunday after shooting an even-par 72 tie for 34th and join Woods on the list of low amateurs at the Masters. “I think that’s one thing I’ll never forget.
 “I was pretty nervous on the first hole. I didn’t really know what I was going to say to him,” Ogletree said. “He just came up -- smiling, laughing, whatever -- and that just kind of settled me down.”
 A Mississippi native who played at Georgia Tech, about two hours away, Ogletree earned his invitation to Augusta National with a victory in the U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst in August, 2019. He had to wait an extra seven months when the coronavirus pandemic delayed the tournament from April to November, but it was worth the wait: For the first 36 holes he was paired with Woods, who won the Amateur three times and went to win 15 majors and 82 tournaments overall as a professional.
 “Every player my age wants to play with Tiger and see what it’s all about,” said Ogletree, who won a silver bowl. “Obviously, he’s not as dominant as he used to be, but he’s still one of the greatest to ever play. And he still hits some shots that you’re like, ‘Wow, I get it now.’ So, it was awesome.”
 John Augenstein was the only other amateur to make the cut. He qualified by finishing second to Ogletree at the U.S. Amateur, losing in the championship at Pinehurst 2 and 1. Augenstein opened with a 69 and was the low amateur after 36 holes at 3 under before shooting a pair of 75s over the weekend and dropping to 55th overall, tied with Phil Mickelson.

Boston Scott had a 56-yard touchdown run and Corey Clement ran in from the 5 to get Philadelphia within 21-17 but the last four drives netted only 59 yards.
 “We’re not where we want to be,” Wentz said. “Personally, I hate losing. It’s frustrating to be where we’re at but we have no choice but to bounce back.”
 The return of Miles Sanders and Alshon Jeffery couldn’t help the offense get on track. Sanders had 85 yards rushing, but dropped two passes. Jeffery was only targeted once in his first game since December 2019.
 “I saw an offense that just wasn’t disciplined, including myself. We’re beating ourselves,” Sanders said.
 The Eagles were hoping to get more help on their offensive line but left guard Isaac Seumalo wasn’t ready to return from a knee injury and guard Nate Herbig didn’t start because of a hand injury. Reserves Sua Opeta and Matt Pryor filled in and New York’s defensive line dominated upfront for much of the game.
 “I’m disappointed. It’s on me the way we played,” said coach Doug Pederson, who fell to 1-4 after a bye in the regular season. “All three phases had a hand in this loss. … It takes everybody. It takes intensity in practice. It takes everybody being on the same page. There’s a work ethic, a pride thing as a team to say ‘enough is enough.’ I know we have been plagued with a lot of injuries but there’s still a lot of pride in that locker room. Guys are mad, I’m mad we lost this game.”

(AP) – China and 14 other countries agreed Sunday to set up the world’s largest trading bloc, encompassing nearly a third of all economic activity, in a deal many in Asia are hoping will help hasten a recovery from the shocks of the pandemic.The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP, was signed virtually on Sunday on the sidelines of the annual summit of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations.“I am delighted to say that after eight years of hard work, as of today, we have officially brought RCEP negotiations to a conclusion for signing,” said host country Vietnam’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc.“The conclusion of RCEP negotiation, the largest free trade agreement in the world, will send a strong message that affirms ASEAN’s leading role in supporting the multilateral trading system, creating a new trading structure in the region, enabling sustainable trade facilitation, revitalizing the supply chains disrupted by COVID-19 and assisting the post-pandemic recovery,” Phuc said.The accord will take already low tariffs on trade between member countries still lower, over time, and is less comprehensive than an 11-nation trans-Pacific trade deal that President Donald Trump pulled out of shortly after taking office.Apart from the 10 ASEAN members, it includes China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, but not the United States. Officials said the accord leaves the door open for India, which dropped out due to fierce domestic opposition to its market- opening requirements, to rejoin the bloc.It will take time to fully assess exact details of the agreement encompassing tariff schedules and rules for all 15 countries involved — the tariffs schedule just for Japan is 1,334 pages long.It is not expected to go as far as the European Union in integrating member economies but does build on existing free trade arrangements.The deal has powerful symbolic ramifications, showing that nearly four years after Trump launched his “America First” policy of forging trade deals with individual countries, Asia remains committed to multi-nation efforts toward freer trade that are seen as a formula for future prosperity.Ahead of Sunday’s RCEP “special summit” meeting, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he would firmly convey his government’s support for “broadening a free and fair economic zone, including a possibility of India’s future return to the deal, and hope to gain support from the other countries.”The accord is also a coup for China, by far the biggest market in the region with more than 1.3 billion people, allowing Beijing to cast itself as a “champion of globalization and multilateral cooperation” and giving it greater influence over rules governing regional trade, Gareth Leather, senior Asian economist for Capital Economics, said in a report.China’s official Xinhua News Agency quoted Premier Li Keqiang hailing the agreement as a victory against protectionism, in remarks delivered via a video link.“The signing of the RCEP is not only a landmark achievement of East Asian regional cooperation, but also a victory of multilateralism and free trade,” Li said.The agreement is expected to help China, Japan and South Korea finally reach a trilateral free trade deal after years of struggling to bridge their differences.Now that Trump’s opponent Joe Biden has been declared president-elect, the region is watching to see how U.S. policy on trade and other issues will evolve.Analysts are skeptical Biden will push hard to rejoin the trans-Pacific trade pact or to roll back many of the U.S. trade sanctions imposed on China by the Trump administration given widespread frustration with Beijing’s trade and human rights records, and accusations of spying and technology theft.Critics of free trade agreements say they tend to encourage companies to move manufacturing jobs overseas. So, having won over disaffected rust-belt voters in Michigan and western Pennsylvania in the Nov. 3 election, Biden is “not going to squander that by going back into TPP,” Michael Jonathan Green of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a web seminar.But given concerns over China’s growing influence, Biden is likely to seek much more engagement with Southeast Asia to protect U.S. interests, he said.The fast-growing and increasingly affluent Southeast Asian market of 650 million people has been hit hard by the pandemic and is urgently seeking fresh drivers for growth.RCEP originally would have included about 3.6 billion people and encompassed about a third of world trade and global GDP. Minus India, it still covers more than 2 billion people and close to a third of all trade and business activity.The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, the retooled version of the North American Free Trade Agreement under Trump, covers slightly less economic activity but less than a tenth of the world’s population. The EU and Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership, the revised version of the deal Trump rejected, also are smaller. RCEP includes six of the 11 remaining CPTPP members.India balked at exposing its farmers and factories to more foreign competition. Among other concerns, Indian dairy farmers are worried about competition from New Zealand and Australian milk and cheese producers. Automakers fear imports from across the region. But overall the biggest fear is over a flood of manufactured goods from China.Trade and investment flows within Asia have vastly expanded over the past decade, a trend that has accelerated amid feuding between the U.S. and China, which have imposed billions of dollars' worth of punitive tariffs on each other’s exports.The RCEP agreement is loose enough to stretch to fit the disparate needs of member countries as diverse as Myanmar, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia. Unlike the CPTPP and EU, it does not establish unified standards on labor and the environment or commit countries to open services and other vulnerable areas of their economies.But it does set rules for trade that will facilitate investment and other business within the region, Jeffrey Wilson, research director at the Perth USAsia Center, said in a report for the Asia Society.“RCEP, therefore, is a much-needed platform for the Indo- Pacific’s post-COVID recovery,” he wrote.ASEAN members include Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.___Associated Press writers Hau Dinh in Hanoi, Vietnam, and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

It was the third time Stafford and Prater were part of winning, fourth-quarter drives this season.
 Stafford threw two of his three touchdown passes in the first half and completed two passes on the final possession. Defensive end Chase Young was called for roughing the passer, giving Detroit the ball at midfield.
 “Rookie mistake," Young, the No. 2 pick overall, acknowledged.
 Stafford threw a 9-yard pass to Marvin Jones to set up Prater's kick and cap his 37th winning drive, a total that ties former New York Giants star Eli Manning for 10th on the NFL’s all-time list.
 The Lions (4-5) won at home for the first time in more than a year after building a 14-point lead at halftime and going ahead 24-3 midway through the third quarter.
 Washington (2-7) pulled into a tie by scoring touchdowns on three straight series in the second half in Alex Smith's first start in nearly two years. But its defense could not stop Stafford when it mattered most in the fourth.
 Prater made a go-ahead, 37-yard field goal with 2:42 remaining.
 Detroit cornerback Desmond Trufant extended the ensuing possession with two penalties that gave Washington first downs and it took advantage, setting up Dustin Hopkins' tying 41-yard field goal.

In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.Trump’s campaign has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be reversed.Nearly two weeks after Election Day, Trump has neither called Biden nor made a formal concession, and White House officials have insisted that they are preparing for a second term.In recent days, Trump appeared to be inching closer to acknowledging the reality of his loss. In comments Friday in the Rose Garden about a coronavirus vaccine, Trump said his administration would “not be going to a lockdown” to slow the spread of COVID-19, and added that “whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it will be? I guess time will tell.”Trump on Sunday renewed his groundless attacks on an election technology firm, Dominion Voting Systems, without evidence of any serious irregularities. Dominion has said it “denies claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems.”The Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency that oversees U.S. election security, said in a statement last week that the “November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.” The agency said, “There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”In his latest fundraising email, Trump told supporters that “we are fighting to ensure EVERY SINGLE LEGAL ballot is counted” and that he had “legal teams on the ground in every critical state.”John Bolton, a former Trump national security adviser, said it was important for party leaders to explain to voters that Trump did lose and that his claims of election fraud are baseless. Bolton left the administration last year. He says he resigned; Trump says he fired Bolton.“I think as every day goes by, it’s clearer and clearer there isn’t any evidence. But if the Republican voters are only hearing Donald Trump’s misrepresentations, it’s not surprising that they believe it,” Bolton said on ABC’s “This Week.” “It’s critical for other Republican leaders to stand up and explain what actually happened. Donald Trump lost what by any evidence we have so far was a free and fair election.”Having none of that was Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney who is helping lead Trump’s national legal front on the election challenge. In a television appearance that Trump previewed on Twitter after his morning tweets, Giuliani denied Trump was conceding — “No, no, no, far from it.”"I guess,'' Giuliani told Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” “you would call it sarcastic.”___Associated Press writers Will Weissert in Wilmington, Delaware, and Zeke Miller contribute to this report.___This story has been corrected to reflect that Trump’s tweet said, “He won,” not “Biden won.”Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

As Trump refuses to accept the outcome of the presidential election, waging a legal battle with unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, his GOP allies in the Senate are following his lead. Senate Republicans need Trump — and his voters — on board for the Georgia race. Privately, though, many Republicans doubt Trump has a path to overturning Biden's victory.

They thought that until capitalist democracy and cultural capitalism will not be destroyed, a social revolution would not be possible. According to these progressive reformers not the armed insurrection and the takeover of political power, with the abolition of the capitalist mode of economy was the way to go, but the destruction of democracy and capitalist culture, through which capitalism was going to fall. Also according to these progressive reformers, the political struggle in the street no longer made sense, but in the world of concepts, not strike was necessary but publications and changing people's thinking. In 1918, Georg Lukacs expressed the idea according to which if family unity and sexual morality are eroded, society can be destroyed. In 1918, Georg Lukacs expressed the idea that if family unity and sexual morality are eroded, society can be destroyed.

If the video footage released so far is anything to go by, the results are compelling — and not nearly as video game-y as one might imagine. Unreal Engine has progressed wildly in the past few years, from a pure game engine to a tool that can be used for involved mixed media production. And it’s a lot cheaper than standard Hollywood production, too, which is exciting to see. If it’s all it’s cracked up to be, it could make Blockbuster-style filmmaking a lot more accessible to smaller, cheaper teams.

A second theory, developed by evolutionary epidemiologist Paul Ewald, which he calls the "theory of virulence,” suggests that, as a rule, the deadlier the germ, the less likely it is to spread. The reason: If victims are quickly immobilized (think of Ebola, for example), then they can’t readily spread the infection. By this thinking, if a germ requires a mobile host to spread, its virulence will, of necessity, decline. Like the older conventional wisdom, the theory of virulence recognizes that many germs will evolve less virulence as they circulate and adapt to the human population. But Ewald’s theory also proposes that germs all have their own strategies to spread, and some of those strategies allow the germ to maintain high virulence _and_ transmissibility.

Perú vive horas agitadas en el plano sociopolítico, a poco del partido que deberán disputar este martes el combinado local y la Selección argentina en Lima, por la cuarta fecha de las Eliminatorias rumbo al Mundial de Qatar 2022.Una manifestación popular en el Congreso para pedir por la dimisión de Manuel Merino, el congresista que había reemplazado como presidente a a Martín Vizcarra, quien fue destituido por “incapacidad moral”, se topó con una feroz represión policial que dejó dos muertos y un centenar de heridos. Y este domingo, Merino renunció. Esto puso en alerta a la seguridad de los seleccionados implicados y también a la Conmebol.La delegación celeste y blanca tiene planificado entrenarse este lunes por la mañana en Ezeiza y viajar a las 17 rumbo a la capital peruana. Por el momento, ese itinerario sigue en pie, según le confirmaron a Clarín desde el búnker de la Selección. Contrariamente a lo ocurrido en La Paz en octubre, esta vez el plantel capitaneado por Lionel Messi no realizará una práctica fuera del país, algo que facilita la logística y la seguridad.Los organismos de seguridad de Conmebol y la Federación Peruana de Fútbol analizarán el escenario. “La idea es jugarlo, con las garantías necesarias”, le adelantaron a este diario desde la Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol.De todos modos, se evaluará al detalle la situación. Un problema es el calendario. No hay fecha disponible para reprogramar el partido en caso de que debiera postergarse por falta de garantías. Si no se juega, ¿Argentina gana los puntos? No, según el reglamento se debe disputar en otro momento.“Quiero hacer reconocimiento a todo el país que presento mi renuncia”, declaró Merino por televisión, lo que desató una celebración de los ciudadanos con cacerolas y aplausos, al día siguiente de la violenta represión.¿Qué ocurrió? En un juicio político relámpago, Vizcarra fue destituido luego de ser acusado de recibir una coima en 2014, cuando era gobernador de la región de Moquegua. El nombramiento de Merino como su sucesor desató una ola de manifestaciones en todo Perú.Pero el sábado todo se volvió negro cuando la Policía reprimió y provocó el caos. Oficialmente se informó que dos hombres fallecieron por heridas de armas de fuego y el Ministerio de Salud añadió que otros 94 resultaron heridos, por politraumatismos, inhalación de gases lacrimógenos o impactos de proyectiles.El equipo dirigido por Ricardo Gareca no se mantuvo ajeno al reclamo del pueblo peruano. De hecho, cuando sonó el himno ante Chile, los futbolistas se entrelazaron los brazos en una clara señal de demostrar la unión entre todos los compatriotas ante este contexto difícil.Se espera que la renuncia de Merino traiga calma y que de aquí al martes todo esté dado para que el encuentro pueda organizarse sin problema alguno. Messi, Scaloni y compañía, mientras tanto, se mantienen expectantes a la espera de confirmaciones.En el ensayo de este domingo, la buena noticia para el DT albiceleste fue que Nicolás Tagliafico se mostró bien físicamente y, de no mediar inconvenientes, podrá estar disponible para jugar desde el arranque. El lateral izquierdo se había perdido el duelo ante Paraguay por una molestia en el isquiotibial izquierdo y en su lugar jugó Nicolás González, quien marcó el gol argentino y fue la figura.¿El regreso de Tagliafico dejará en el banco a González? No necesariamente. La duda de Scaloni es si mantener a Lucas Ocampos o adelantar al de Stuttgart en el campo, ya que naturalmente es delantero.Otra alternativa es que Ángel Di María, que ingresó bien en el segundo tiempo en La Boca, sea titular como extremo izquierdo. Lo que está claro es que Giovani Lo Celso reemplazará al lesionado Exequiel Palacios.HS

These two teams also met in the state semifinal in 2017 and 2018, with Hoban winning 30-6 and 41-7, respectively.
 The game on Nov. 13 told a different story as Avon battled back from a 14-0 halftime deficit to tie the game at 14 with a little more than nine minutes remaining in the game. The Eagles gave it all they had and fought until the final whistle.
 Unfortunately for Avon, they fell just short as its quest for the program's first state championship continues.
 While Coach Mike Elder's team would have liked to win a state championship, it still had a very successful campaign once again. The Eagles made it to the state final four for the fourth straight season, they put together another undefeated regular season, won their fifth straight Southwestern Conference championship and they defeated rival Avon Lake twice in 2020.
 Elder has built a consistent winner at Avon, which isn't an easy feat in high school football. Sustained success is what he calls it, something he learned from his days as a player and coach at Mount Union.

Rekeshia Bennett: Oh my God. That’s such a good question. I get so much anxiety from social media — even before I decided to pursue my music wholeheartedly. But just with everyday regular social media, it’s one of those things that gives me so much anxiety. But what I do now, I post because I am trying to get more traction on my music and me as an artist. But I post and walk away. I tell my husband or somebody else, “You can look at it, and tell me what I need to do and not do, but I don’t want to look at it.” It’s so hard to say that because you need to, right? You need to look at it to see what you’re doing, and it takes so much out of you to look at it. It’s just such a hard place for me mentally sometimes to be in. But I’m doing it. I’m using my social media platform right now to promote the music and get the message out there. Hopefully, it works out.

They chose to stick with the model that just won them the 2020 championship. Schroder will fill an immediate hole. His expiring contract won't hamper their 2021 offseason ambitions. The majority of their bench remains intact, and they have the tools to improve upon it significantly. More importantly, they have the tools to go about that improvement process however they see fit.
 Do the Lakers want to stick with one-year deals again in order to clear the decks for a 2021 free agent? They haven't taken that off of the table. Do they want to use their mid-level exception or trade pieces to aggressively pursue more expensive long-term players? That's available to them as well. A year after the Lakers wasted the first week of free agency waiting on Leonard's decision, they'll enter the 2020 market with the freedom to pursue whatever opportunities present themselves.
 Some teams need to take the sure thing. Historically speaking, the Lakers don't. Veterans want to play in Los Angeles. They want to play for championships. And they want to play with LeBron. Now the Lakers are positioned to fully take advantage of that, and even if meant giving away their chance at a three-star juggernaut this season, it clears several other paths to both short- and long-term contention. Not a bad haul for Danny Green and a late first-round pick.

"There's a lot of things I learned from there that people at our school have bought into," Elder said. "We have a blueprint that we believe in and that our kids believe in. It's just a matter of following the script and doing the work it requires. It takes the support of a lot of people to make that possible."
 Sustained success is the standard at Avon, something Elder instilled in the program after arriving at Avon in 2007.
 "We've been very clear since Day 1 that our program needs to be much more about a process than it is about winning and losing," Elder said. "What I want as a coach every year is to get a group of kids to buy in to each other and to help develop them as young men. It's a matter of maximizing their ability and their potential to take it as far as you want."
 Elder's players buy in year after year. It shows on and off the field in the way the players conduct themselves in the offseason, prepare for games during the week and in they way they play on Friday nights.
 Avon's senior class definitely bought in and reaped the benefits. The group played its final game Nov. 13 and accomplished a lot in its four seasons together. They won 24 straight regular-season contests, put together three undefeated regular seasons and made it to the state semifinals in four straight seasons.
 "They are a tight group and are very close to one another," Elder said. "They paid attention to the classes that came before them and they led in the weight room, in the offseason and through a pandemic. These kids never backed down from any challenges.
 "There is a belief that they had in each other, they played exceptionally hard for each other and there's not one thing they could have done differently that would have made me more proud of them. Would we like to be playing next week for a state championship? Absolutely, but does that mean I'm any less proud of this team and their accomplishments? Nope, not even close."
 Elder, his team and the Avon community have a lot to be proud of. They also have a lot to look forward to because as always, Avon will be back.

NEW YORK — As opening day finally approached, Freddie Freeman had far bigger concerns than perfecting his swing and practicing his scoops.
 Just being able to walk a few steps was hard enough.
 “It wasn’t the way I wanted to start, with COVID,” the Atlanta Braves first baseman said. “I was able to beat it.”
 And then some.
 Freeman easily won the NL MVP award Thursday, topping off a trying year that saw him become so ill with COVID-19 he prayed “please don’t take me.”
 Chicago White Sox slugger José Abreu earned the AL MVP, a reward for powering his team back into the playoffs for the first time since 2008.
 Freeman got 28 of the 30 first-place votes in balloting by members of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. Dodgers outfielder Mookie Betts got the other two firsts to finish second, and San Diego third baseman Manny Machado was third.
 In a season affected from spring training to the World Series by the pandemic, perhaps it was fitting the final major award of the year went to someone infected by the coronavirus.
 Three weeks before the delayed opening day in late July, Freeman’s body temperature spiked at 104.5 degrees and he lost his sense of taste and smell. At one point, he recalled earlier, he said a little prayer because “I wasn’t ready.”
 “It impacted me pretty hard,” he said.
 Freeman said it took him a couple weeks into the season to find his footing. He tried to conserve his energy, too — he skipped the daily routine of batting practice on the field and cut down how much he hopped off first base while holding on runners.
 The 31-year-old Freeman soon found his stride, batting .341 with 13 home runs and 53 RBIs while playing all 60 games. A powerful lefty batter with the ability to spray the ball all over the field, he led the majors with 23 doubles and 51 runs.
 Boosted by the four-time All-Star, the Braves won the NL East for the third straight season and came within one win of reaching the World Series for the first time since 1999.
 Freeman is the sixth different player in Braves franchise history to be the NL MVP. Chipper Jones most recently took the honor in 1999 — Freeman wears a tattered Braves T-shirt under his uniform that was passed down to him from Jones.
 Two-time NL MVP Dale Murphy of the Braves announced Freeman’s win on MLB Network.
 Betts was bidding to join Frank Robinson as the only players to win the MVP award in both leagues. The 28-year-old outfielder took the AL honor in 2018 while leading Boston to the World Series title.
 Traded by the Red Sox to Los Angeles early this year, Betts hit .292 with 16 homers and 39 RBIs and was the catalyst in the Dodgers’ run to their first championship since 1988.
 Machado hit .304 with 16 homers and 47 RBIs as San Diego made its first playoff appearance since 2006. Padres shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. finished fourth in the voting and Washington outfielder Juan Soto was fifth.
 Cleveland third baseman José Ramírez finished second in the AL MVP voting and Yankees infielder DJ LeMahieu was third.
 Abreu led the majors with 60 RBIs and 148 total bases, and topped the AL with 76 hits and a .617 slugging percentage. He played in all 60 games during the virus-shortened season as Chicago claimed a wild-card spot.
 “Ultimate run producer,” Freeman praised.
 Surrounded by family members, Abreu put his head down for a minute after hearing he’d won and teared up.
 “That was a very special moment,” he said through a translator.
 The 33-year-old Abreu batted .317 with 19 home runs, connecting six times in a three-game series against the Cubs in late August. That barrage of longballs at Wrigley Field was part of his 22-game hitting streak, the longest in the majors this year.
 Abreu gave credit to manager Rick Renteria, who left the team after the season in what was described as a mutual decision. Recently hired Hall of Fame skipper Tony La Russa is now facing charges in a drunken driving arrest — Abreu said he was eager to play for La Russa.
 “Keep pushing forward, keep moving forward,” Abreu said.
 Abreu was the 2014 AL Rookie of the Year and is a three-time All-Star. He became the fourth different White Sox player to win the AL MVP, joining Frank Thomas (1993-94), Dick Allen (1972) and Nellie Fox (1959).
 Abreu was the third Cuban-born player to be an MVP, along with Jose Canseco and Zoilo Versalles.
 This was the first time since Ryan Howard and Justin Morneau in 2006 that a pair of first basemen won the MVPs.
 Freeman got a $185,185 bonus and Abreu received $37,037 for winning in contract bonuses prorated because of the shortened season.
 AL Cy Young Award winner Shane Bieber of Cleveland was fourth and Angels outfielder Mike Trout was fifth. A three-time AL MVP, Trout had finished in the top four every season since he was AL Rookie of the Year in 2012.
 This will be the first time in more than 75 years the MVP trophies don’t carry the name and likeness of Kenesaw Mountain Landis, baseball’s first commissioner.
 In an Associated Press story in late June, former MVPs Barry Larkin, Terry Pendleton and Mike Schmidt said they favored pulling Landis’ name off future plaques because of concerns over his handling of Black players.
 BBWAA members overwhelmingly voted in October to remove any mention of Landis from the MVP trophy and the award won’t be named for anyone this year. The organization will discuss in 2021 whether to name it for someone else, with former Negro Leagues star Josh Gibson and Robinson among those being mentioned as possibilities.
 “It’s just time. It really is time for the name to be removed,” Freeman said.
 Pendleton works for the Braves, and Freeman paid attention when his friend spoke out over the summer. Freeman said he thought Robinson’s name on the plaque would be proper.
 Landis became commissioner in 1920 and no Blacks played in the majors through his reign that ended when he died in 1944. Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947.
 Landis’ legacy is “always a complicated story” that includes “documented racism,” official MLB historian John Thorn has said.
 In 1931, Landis gave the BBWAA control of picking and presenting the MVPs. During the 1944 World Series, the group decided to add Landis’ name to the plaque. His name had appeared on all MVP plaques since then and was featured more prominently than the actual winners of the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Memorial Baseball Award.

President Donald Trump appeared on Sunday to acknowledge losing the election but then backtracked and said he concedes "nothing," while projected winner Joe Biden focused on tackling the coronavirus pandemic and set meetings with pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines.
 Ron Klain, Biden’s pick for White House chief of staff, urged Trump’s administration to allow a seamless transition, calling it vital for national security and combating COVID-19.
 The pandemic will be a paramount concern for Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. Klain said Biden's scientific advisors will meet with Pfizer Inc and other drugmakers starting this week to prepare for the "giant logistical project" of widespread vaccination against a virus that has killed more than 245,000 Americans and left millions more unemployed.
 Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, won a series of battleground states that the Republican incumbent had won in 2016. Trump is pursuing litigation contesting election results. Legal experts have said the litigation stands little chance of altering the election's outcome. Election officials of both parties have said there is no evidence of major irregularities.
 "He won because the Election was Rigged," Trump wrote on Twitter, not referring to Biden by name. "NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, Dominion, with a bad reputation & bum equipment that couldn't even qualify for Texas (which I won by a lot!), the Fake & Silent Media, & more!"
 About 90 minutes later, Trump wrote, "He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED ELECTION!"
 "WE WILL WIN!" he added.
 Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Klain, said, "Donald Trump's Twitter feed doesn't make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that."
 The decision by the General Services Administration, headed by a Trump appointee, not to recognize Biden as president-elect has prevented Biden and his team from gaining access to government office space and funding normally afforded to an incoming administration to ensure a smooth transition.
 Klain called on the agency to formally recognize Biden, saying it is critical to ensure that he receives intelligence briefings describing national security threats before taking office and to facilitate coordination with the White House coronavirus task force.
 "Joe Biden is going to become president of the U.S. in the midst of an ongoing crisis. That has to be a seamless transition," Klain said.
 Klain also urged Congress to pass bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation. Talks on such legislation stalled before the election. Democratic congressional leaders last week called upon Republican lawmakers to join them in passing a relief measure before the end of the year.
 "This could be a first example of bipartisan action post-election," Klain said.
 Klain previously said a smooth transition is necessary to ensure the government is prepared to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine early next year. Pfizer announced last week that its vaccine candidate proved more than 90% effective in initial trial results, giving hope that widespread vaccination in the coming months could help get the pandemic under control.
 Other companies also are in advanced stages of developing promising vaccines.
 “You know, it’s great to have a vaccine, but vaccines don’t save lives. Vaccinations save lives,” Klain said. “And that means you’ve got to get that vaccine into people’s arms all over this country.”
 Speaking on CNN's "State of the Union" program, Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, also urged speedy transition efforts to help confront the pandemic.
 “Of course it would be better if we could start working with them,” Fauci said of coordination between the existing task force and Biden’s team.
 Fauci welcomed Klain’s selection as chief of staff, saying he had been “terrific” under former President Barack Obama in managing the U.S. response to a 2014 Ebola outbreak.

HIS team have had the upper hand on Ireland in recent years, but Eddie Jones has warned his England charges that they face a "massive step up" in class at Twickenham on Saturday. The World Cup finalists come into the game on the back of wins over Italy and Georgia, while Ireland have taken on France and Wales and Jones said Andy Farrell's side will be physically at the pitch of the game.The colourful coach said it was like stepping up from playing World No 35 ranked tennis player Kei Nishikori to facing No 1 Novak Djokovic.&quot;It&rsquo;s a massive step up. You&rsquo;ve just got to look at the world rankings. Georgia are ranked 12, Italy are 16th I think (they're 14th), and Ireland are in the top four or five. It&rsquo;s like going from playing Nishikori to Djokovic.&quot;Ireland are a tough, physical team, They&rsquo;ve been at the top of world rugby for the last four or five years, in the top four or five teams. &quot;Obviously, they've had some great European success and had a change of coach after the World Cup and Andy has made their attack a little bit unpredictable, changed their selection, bringing in Gibson-Park and James Lowe, so they present a massive physical challenge and a good tactical challenge.&quot;The last two games haven&rsquo;t helped our preparations, our difficulty is that we&rsquo;ve played two Tier Two countries and we&rsquo;re going to play against a team who have had a great preparation against Wales and France. So we&rsquo;re going to have to prepare really well this week. &quot;England full-back Elliot Daly echoed his coach's sentiments.&quot;Playing against Ireland, they are very organised with what they do. They are a very physical forward-orientated team as well, obviously with some quality backs,&quot; the Saracens star said.&quot;You are ready for anything against them, you don&rsquo;t really know what they are going to bring. They bring a good kicking game, so we will be looking at that this week.&quot;

  During Wednesday’s event, the public can watch Santa arrive by helicopter and commemorate the inaugural skate. The ice rink will officially be open for business later that night.


  “We are excited to welcome The Holidays on Ice to Branson,” said Craig Wescott, CEO and co-owner of The Track Family Fun Parks. “This is the culmination of the efforts of many in the community, and we are thrilled to provide such a wonderful location for Branson residents and visitors to gather this Christmas season.”


  The oval-shaped ice skating rink will be the same size as The Rink at Rockefeller Center in New York City.


  The Track Family Fun Parks partnered with The Holidays on Ice to install and operate the ice rink.


  “Branson was not difficult to find as we searched for the best holiday cities in the country,” added Rich Yakkey of The Holidays on Ice, whose family has owned and operated the company since 2014. “Our goal is for people to have unique memories and holiday experiences, and we look forward to adding ice skating to what Branson and The Track Family Fun Parks currently offer to create holiday memories.”


  Operating hours will depend on weather, but the initial plan is for the rink to be open during both day and night. Nighttime skaters will not only enjoy the light shows on the Branson Ferris Wheel, but holiday lights strung around the rink itself.


  The Ferris Wheel will feature Christmas Electrify: A Music and Light Spectacular with 2 Christmas light shows that ignite the night with 16,000 LED lights dancing to traditional and rockin' Christmas music every hour on the hour after dark.

Fresh off a crucial win over their NFC East rival Philadelphia Eagles, the New York Giants have rewarded arguably their most reliable player of the 2020 season. The team announced Sunday that it has signed kicker Graham Gano to a three-year contract extension that will keep the veteran in town through 2023.
 Notably cut by the Carolina Panthers this offseason after an eight-year run there, Gano signed with the Giants in August, ultimately replacing former Pro Bowler Aldrick Rosas. Since then, he's turned in a near-perfect performance as New York's kicker, connecting on 21 of 22 field goal tries, including 20 straight and four out of five beyond 50 yards; as well as 16 extra points. That puts the 33-year-old on pace for a career year -- even better than his 2017 Pro Bowl campaign, in which he made more than 97 percent of his FGs.
 Gano's new deal is worth $14 million over three years, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, with $9.5 million fully guaranteed. His new $4.66 million annual average, which will go into effect after this year, makes him the third-highest-paid kicker in the league, behind only Justin Tucker and Robbie Gould.

OLD-TIMERS DAY
 If they gave out an award for the best-finishing player from the PGA Tour Champions, 63-year-old Bernhard Langer would have collected the prize.
 The two-time Masters winner from Germany shot a 1-under 71 in the final round to finish at 3-under 285 — the best score among three 50-and-older players who made the cut. Mike Weir (290) and Phil Mickelson (291) are 13 years younger and only became eligible for the PGA Tour Champions this year.
 Langer also finished one stroke ahead of U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who was the longest hitter in the tournament with an average of 324 yards per drive. Langer was last of the 60 who made the cut, averaging 260 yards.
 “I felt right in the middle of it, in the thick of it,” said Langer, who played with DeChambeau in the final round. “I got to experience the longest guys in the world right now, and it’s quite amazing. Different game.”
 Langer’s game is holding up just fine. He became the oldest player in Masters history to make the cut, beating the record set two decades ago by Tommy Aaron.
 Langer might set another record or two before he’s done.
