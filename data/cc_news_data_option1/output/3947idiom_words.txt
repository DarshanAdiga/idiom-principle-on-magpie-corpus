Amanda Holden is well-known for her risqué outfits on Britain’s Got Talent.
 But despite her daring attire, she manages to keep herself in check thanks to her eagle-eyed co-workers.
 Amanda says that each outfit is checked over by a 'team' of producers before she appears on air.
 Last weekend the TV star divided opinion with her midnight blue floor length gown which featured off the shoulder sleeves and thigh-high split.
 Ofcom received 235 complaints about the talent show judge’s dress during the BGT live semi-final.
