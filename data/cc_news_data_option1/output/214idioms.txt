The big issue with climate change is finding ways to draw down greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere. I was fascinated with Paul Hawkins’ book _Drawdown_ , which ranked the top hundred ways to reduce emissions. Most people would think the answer would be more solar energy or carbon sequestration. But society needs to get up to speed with its needs. Actually, some of the most effective carbon reduction solutions are the empowerment of women, education for girls, and birth control for women, so we don't overpopulate the world, and women can take a real role in the future.

 Chinas birth rate dropped last year to its lowest level since the Communist country was founded in 1949, adding to concerns that an aging society and shrinking workforce will pile pressure on a slowing economy. To avoid a demographic crisis, the government relaxed its one-child policy in 2016 to allow people to have two children, but the change has not resulted in an increase in pregnancies.In 2019, the birth rate stood at 10.48 per 1,000 people, down slightly from the year before, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics NBS released on Friday. The number of births has now fallen for three consecutive years, still, there were 14.65 million babies born in 2019.He Yafu, an independent demographer based in southern Guangdong province, said the number of births was the lowest since 1961, the last year of a famine that left tens of millions dead. He said there were around 11.8 million births that year. US-based academic Yi Fuxian, the senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told AFP that even though China has abolished its one-child policy, there has been a shift in the mindset of the population, with people now used to smaller families.He added that a higher cost of living is also a factor, noting that daycare is expensive and inconvenient in China, posing another deterrence. He believes that Chinas population is over-estimated, and according to his work, the real population began to decline in 2018.According to official figures, Chinas population stood at 1.4 billion by the end of 2019, increasing by 4.67 million from the year before. While Chinas limit on family sizes could be removed altogether eventually, the demographer He said citizens are still being punished for having three children, even though some areas have reduced punitive measures.China has signaled that it might end limits on family size as a draft of the new Civil Code -- due to be introduced at the annual session of the rubber-stamp parliament in March -- omits all mention of family planning. The one-child policy was introduced by top leader Deng Xiaoping to curb population growth and promote economic development, with exceptions for rural families whose first-born was a female, and for ethnic minorities.The measure was mainly enforced through fines but was also notorious for forced abortions and sterilizations. The result was dramatic fertility rates dropped from 5.9 births per woman in 1970 to about 1.6 in the late 1990s. The replacement level for a population is 2.1.This could pose a problem for the economy in the future, as the countrys workforce continued to shrink last year. The NBS said there were 896.4 million people aged between 16 and 59 -- its population of working age -- a drop from the 897.3 million in 2018.This marks the eighth consecutive year of decline, and the workforce is expected to decline by as much as 23 percent by 2050. The demographic problem is a slow, long-term one, He told AFP.He noted that aging Japan, which saw rapid growth in the 1980s, has seen almost zero percent growth in recent years. Chinas economy grew by 6.1 percent in 2019, its slowest pace since 1990 as it was hit by weaker demand and a bruising trade war with the United States.Because Chinas education levels have been going up, in the short term, the population issue should not impact growth too much, he said. But in the long run, if the trend continues, it would pose a huge drag on economic growth.

Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has called on his players to "step up" and fill the goalscoring void left by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's absence after the forward's three-match ban was upheld.          The Gabon international, who opened the scoring in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace, was booked for a tackle on Max Meyer but the video assistant referee upgraded the punishment to a red card.          Arsenal appealed against Aubameyang's dismissal but the punishment stands.          The former Borussia Dortmund player, 30, has scored 14 of Arsenal's 29 Premier League goals this season.          "Players have to step up," Arteta said on Wednesday when asked if the team would miss their suspended captain.          "You know, when one of your big players is not there, they have to take responsibility. I'm sure when they're not playing, they want a chance and they talk.          "It's time to talk on the pitch, not outside. You come on there, you make the impact that he made and you show me that you are as good as him or even better. You have the chance."          Arteta has also been hit by an injury to defender Sead Kolasinac.          The left-back is a doubt for Saturday's Sheffield United game due to a thigh injury, with fellow left-back Kieran Tierney and right-back Calum Chambers both long-term absentees.          Arsenal have been linked with a move for Manchester City's John Stones, with whom Arteta worked at the Etihad Stadium, but he said there would be no move for the England international.          "John is a player that I really like and I followed. We signed him when I was at Manchester City and I worked with him for many years and know him well," he said.          "When I look at centre backs he has many attributes that I like from one, but we're not interested."

Amnesty International said Wednesday it had evidence Iranian security personnel used "unlawful force" over the weekend during peaceful protests after Tehran admitted it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian airliner.          The rights group cited verified images and eyewitness testimonies indicating authorities had targeted protesters with rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray, along with pointed airgun pellets normally used for hunting.          It said security forces also beat demonstrators with batons, kicked and punched them and made arbitrary arrests during protests on Saturday and Sunday.          A Ukraine International Airlines plane was shot down by a missile shortly after takeoff from Tehran on January 8, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board.          Iran initially dismissed Western claims it was brought down by a missile before admitting it on Saturday.          The blunder and the official response sparked four consecutive nights of protests.          Amnesty cited verified videos in which people helping the wounded are heard saying they had been shot, as well as X-rays showing pellets lodged in two protesters' legs.           It added that the Iranian security and intelligence forces were "maintaining a heavy presence in some hospitals raising fears they plan to arrest patients".          The London-based rights group said that "in many cases the actions by the security forces violated the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment under international law".          Several protesters had not sought hospital treatment for pellet wounds for fear of being detained, it added, while some facilities in Tehran had turned away the wounded, warning they could be arrested.           Amnesty cited an eyewitness identified as Mahsa from Tehran, who said security forces had fired tear gas into the entrance of a metro station to stop people joining the protest.          "A member of the security forces chased me when they saw me filming the protest and that's when I was shot in the leg with a pointed pellet," the statement quoted her as saying.          She said the authorities had threatened doctors and that several centres where she had sought treatment had turned her away.           Amnesty also cited reports of scores of arrests in cities where demonstrations took place, saying authorities were "denying the families of some detainees information about their fate and whereabouts".          Philip Luther, Amnesty's regional research and advocacy chief, urged Iran to release those who had been arbitrarily detained.          "The Iranian authorities must end the repression as a matter of urgency and ensure the security forces exercise maximum restraint and respect protesters' rights to peaceful expression and assembly," he said.

AB de Villiers will be welcomed back into the South African team ahead of the T20 World Cup, captain Faf du Plessis said on Wednesday.          Batting star De Villiers, who retired from international cricket in 2018, was quoted on an Australian website on Tuesday as saying he was keen to return.           He said he had been talking with former captain Graeme Smith, South Africa’s interim director of cricket, as well as coach Mark Boucher and Du Plessis.          Speaking on the eve of South Africa’s third Test against England, which starts on Thursday, Du Plessis hinted that De Villiers’s return was almost a done deal, although both De Villiers and South African assistant coach Enoch Nkwe have emphasised that it is far from finalised.          He made himself available for the one-day World Cup last year, only to be rejected, with officials saying he left it too late and calling him up would be unfair to other players.          - De Villiers 'keen' -          Du Plessis first revealed last month that he had been talking to his one-time schoolmate, who is among the world’s most in-demand T20 players.          "It's the same as what I mentioned before," said Du Plessis.           "We spoke and I was very keen to have him back even before the new coaching staff was on board."          Now it seems the team's senior management are similarly keen.          "It was a process of what does the next year look like in terms of T20 cricket," said Du Plessis.          "How many games, where, when, what? And then try to unfold that in a way that he can come back.          "He's keen to come back. I don't know when.           "In an ideal world, we would like to make sure we can play our best 11, 12, 13 players for a few games or in a few series leading up to a T20 World Cup."          Du Plessis said he did not want a repeat of what he said happened ahead of last year's 50-overs World Cup when combinations were not settled before the tournament.           "There was a search to find the players and the combinations. I would like to settle into that combination a little earlier so the guys can play as many games as possible together," he said.          De Villiers is currently playing in Australia’s Big Bash League, which ends on February 8, and is committed to playing in the Indian Premier League from March 29 to May 24.          South Africa have three T20 international series ahead of the World Cup in October and November.           They play three home matches against England from February 12, followed immediately by three against Australia. They are also scheduled to play a five-match T20 series in the West Indies in August.

Whew! We have hit the ground running in 2020. Literally.              Some break in the new year with a bang; others ease into their groove; either way, as long as you are moving.              The lower body is a target zone for many whether it is to tighten up and tone, build balance and endurance, or simply to increase strength. It's the whole lower half of our body so our options are plentiful.              Our move today is a close/wide stance, side to side squat. This move will be targeting inner and outer thighs, quads, and hamstring and build coordination also.              All you need is a good area to move around in. You can also add hand weights for extra resistance.              Begin this exercise by standing tall, holding your chest up, core engaged, and feet slightly wider than your hips.              Start by "sitting into" your squat. Go as low as you can efficiently hold this position, and step one leg out to a "wide stance" squat, quickly followed by bringing the other leg over to a close stance position, (again).              Now, return to your starting standing post, then immediately return to a squat. And this time, step out to the side with the opposite leg, into another wide stance, bringing the trail leg in close then stand again.              Continue this side to side move for at least 10 times in each direction.              Take a small break, then return for at least two more sets.              This move can be intensified by adding weight, and simplified by returning to a standing position after each squat motion.              And one of the best parts is this can double as cardio too!              Basically, this is a simple lower body move to add into your growing fitness plan for the new year.

"The Recording Academy Board of Trustees is committed to fostering a safe, diverse, and inclusive workplace, music industry, and society."          Dugan succeeded Neil Portnow, who'd led the Grammys since 2002. Before joining (RED), the AIDS organization that launched in 2006, Dugan was president of Disney Publishing Worldwide and executive vice president at EMI/Capitol Records. She started her career as an attorney on Wall Street.          Dugan didn't immediately reply to an Associated Press email seeking comment.          Before Dugan, music executive Christine Farnon held the top position at the academy for years, though she never had the title of president and CEO. She held multiple positions at the Grammys throughout her tenure, retiring in 1992 as executive vice president. Michael Greene became the first official president and CEO of the academy in 1988, leading the organization until 2002, when Portnow took over.          This year's Grammys broadcast is set to feature performances by Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Demi Lovato, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt, Tyler, the Creator, Run-DMC, Rosalia, H.E.R. and Lizzo, the top nominee with eight.

A commentary published Jan. 12 in The Sun called for candidates for state attorney (and other offices) to "take a stand" on certain issues. While no longer a candidate, I write to address the inaccuracies and politically motivated statements in that "call for activism" piece.                                That commentary calls for saving money without suggesting how to do that, ignoring how much my office has done over the years to cut costs, including by finding ways to reduce incarceration both pre-trial and after conviction, efforts that I hope my successor will continue to pursue. Justice, however, isn't and shouldn't be driven by money.                                As to restoration of voting rights for felons, Amendment 4 is clear that eligibility for relief requires completion of all terms of a sentence, including satisfying financial obligations. Anyone who thinks otherwise probably has not read the entire wording of the amendment and almost certainly did not see the Supreme Court proceedings approving that language, in which the proponents of the amendment agreed that that was so.                                To implement this, the Legislature passed a process allowing anyone seeking relief from financial obligations caused by their own conviction to petition the court for forgiveness of those obligations. Ironically, since that law passed, I have seen not one such motion filed in our local courts. Not one.                                I doubt that Miami-Dade has really seen "tens of thousands" of such actions, but if they have that is for them to deal with in their courts. If and when any motions like this are filed here they will be dealt with on their individual merits, which to me would include a showing of having made some effort to satisfy those obligations and a true inability to have done so, leading to a hardship that would warrant the court granting relief.                                Remember, the financial obligations involved are legal, statutorily required parts of a sentence brought about by a defendant's own actions in committing a crime.                                It is offensive to characterize the Legislature's actions in passing this process, and in particular Sen. Keith Perry's support of it, as "racist." There is nothing racist about this; the amendment and the implementing law apply across the board regardless of race. Until we stop accusing everyone who does anything we don't agree with of racism we will never move forward as an equal society.                                The opinion piece called on our next state attorney to refuse to prosecute "petty drug crimes." This statement shows a fundamental lack of understanding, or worse a total disregard, for the law. The state attorney is sworn to uphold the law.                                While I have discretion in how to prosecute and resolve a case, it is not my privilege, nor will it be that of my successor, to arbitrarily decide that I will not prosecute certain crimes because I don't agree with the law. Doing so would be a violation of my oath of office.                                I am well aware of the election of so-called reformist prosecutors in some parts of the nation and that some of those people refuse to prosecute certain crimes in their jurisdictions. I hope the day never comes where our circuit elects a prosecutor who would violate the law in this way. If you don't agree with a law you seek its repeal or amendment. You don't disregard it.                                Finally, it is disingenuous to make vague, blanket accusations that our local criminal justice system is somehow broken and, specifically, "denies justice to victims of sexual assault." Victims in these and all cases have input.                                Early this month a sex offender was tried and convicted for crimes that will put him in prison for life. That defendant was not an isolated example of the work of our prosecutors who focus on cases of that sort. Rather, it is typical of their work in evaluating and prosecuting sexual assault cases.                                Are we successful in all such cases? No, of course not. There are, after all, legal requirements that sometimes cannot be met to allow a case to go forward. But the suggestion, made without support, that something is amiss and needs to be changed is reckless and serves no purpose other than to further an unspecified agenda.                                I agree that voters should educate themselves on issues and candidates, including for state attorney. In doing so be very careful that you choose someone who understands and will follow the law, not someone who panders to unspecified cries demanding reform merely to advance their own agenda regardless of ethics or the law.                                William P. Cervone is state attorney of the Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida.

Mr Verhofstadt told Today he had been told that the UK government was looking at the possibility of EU citizens being able to print out documentary proof of their status.          And he said the possibility had been raised of EU citizens sitting on the independent monitoring authority that will be in place to oversee citizens' rights.           Asked whether he thought the UK could ever rejoin the EU in the future, Mr Verhofstadt said he thought it would eventually happen but "difficult to say when".          "There will be a young generation who will say, 'What have we done? We want to go back,'" he added.          Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan praised the UK government's handling of the issue of citizens' rights, saying: "A system is now up and running, and it is by far the most effective and the most generous in any of the EU countries.          "I don't think you will find a single state among the [other] 27 [EU states] that has a system in place to grant rights to established UK nationals that is working as generously and without any cost to the people concerned, as ours is in return."

The habitat and cultural impacts of raw material extraction are often an out of sight out of mind issue. For example, we don’t see the impacts of harvesting tropical hardwood lumber from the Amazon, so it doesn’t seem so problematic to use it. We don’t see the ecosystem decline after the removal of the keystone species tree that is cut to make tropical hardwood lumber. We don’t hear about the murders of indigenous people to intimidate them to leave their protected land so tropical hardwoods can be harvested. And we don’t know that there is a 78 percent chance that the tropical hardwood we are using was harvested illegally (Greenpeace 2014).

Touchless sensors market is currently in nascent stage and is expected to show strong growth in near future. This is majorly due to several advantages of touchless sensors over conventional touch based sensing systems. Touchless sensors are cost effective as compared to the touch based sensors and require low maintenance cost. In addition, as the system is touch free, wear and tear caused to the sensor system is significantly reduced thereby extending the life of system. Touchless sensors can be easily installed with the existing hardware and do not incur additional installation costs. As the systems are based on touchless sensing technology, touchless sensor systems can also be used for security purposes especially in areas with restricted access. Furthermore, growing demand for sophisticated and contact-free sensing systems is another significant factor boosting the growth of touchless sensors market. Unlike conventional touch based sensors, touchless sensors analyze the biometric image to check if it is unmodified. This significantly increases the security against fake entries at access points.

The win by Heisenberg in yesterdays re-run of the Central Otago Cup has led to a very generous donation by the horse's connections, owners Ross and Angela Gordon, trainer Robert Dunn and the horse's regular driver John Dunn.          The race was originally run at Omakau but had to be abandoned when champion driver Ricky May suffered a major medical incident and was flown to Dunedin Hospital in a critical condition.          The Group Three feature race was re-run yesterday at the Young Quinn Raceway at Wyndham and was won by Heisenberg in a very quick time.          Robert Dunn explained that after the race Ross Gordon rang him and said he and Angela wanted to express their appreciation for the care Ricky May received on the 2nd January at Omakau.          "Ross, Angela, Johnny and I decided to donate four and a half thousand dollars of the Cup winnings to charity.  $1,500 to the helicopter trust fund for picking up Ricky, $1,500 to St John who were great on the day and $1,500 to Team Teals Ellie Barron (who performed mouth the mouth on May). Ross wanted to do that and I said to him that Johnny and I would come on board as well."          Driver John Dunn was trailing May in the race at Omakau and saw the incident unfold. He managed to pull his horse back and warn trailing drivers.
