MALCOLM BRIGHT (Tom Payne, "The Walking Dead") has a gift. He knows how killers think and how their minds work. Why? Back in the 1990s, his father was one of the worst, a notorious serial killer called "The Surgeon." So it makes sense Bright is the best criminal psychologist around; murder is THE FAMILY business. He will use his twisted genius to help the NYPD solve crimes and stop killers, all while dealing with a manipulative mother, annoyingly normal sister, a homicidal father still looking to bond with his prodigal son, and his own constantly evolving neuroses.

All in all I truly love this car. As I drive it more I will update this review, but Honda hit a home run in my opinion. I've had a 2002 Civix EX, a 2006 Element EX, a Nissan 350z Convertible, and so far this is my favors car overall, hands down. If you can afford it upgrade to the leather, it's so worth it. Even fully loaded it's not an expensive car. I look forward to getting up and driving this car every day. I can't wait to go on some camping / road trip adventures in this wonderful car.

 EX 4dr SUV AWD (1.8L 4cyl CVT)
 Pros:


--DocBreak--
Just about everything is new under the hood as well. The four-cylinder engine is still 1.5 liters in size, but various revisions, including the addition of direct injection technology, help it produce a little more power and better fuel efficiency than before. A new six-speed manual transmission (the previous Fit only had five forward gears) and a new continuously variable automatic transmission (replacing a traditional five-speed automatic) are also part of the deal. Hit the road and you should see an impressive 32-36 mpg combined, depending on what model you pick.

Still more room was needed to keep the battery case from dragging on speed bumps, so the entire body was raised 1.6 inches on its suspension. Taller springs and a new aluminum subframe do the trick up front, but the battery intrudes into space claimed by the Fit's standard-issue twist-beam rear axle. Oh, and there are 675 more pounds to cart around.

I have two minor complaints though. First, you can't use apple CarPlay with the this car, which lets you use Apple maps for navigation instead of Hondas Nav. It's not that big a deal because I can Bluetooth my phone and have my phone give me directions still. But it would be nice to mirror it on the big Honda display. Honda nav is sufficient, but not great. Truth be told though, I did not buy the EXl for the Navigation. I bought it for the leather seats, and let me tell you that in my opinion it was worth every penny. The interior EXL just feels high class, and looks it too. I have a feeling it will withstand the test of time much better, and is much easier to clean than the fabric. I also find the firmer leather seats to be more comfortable than the fabric seats. Since I wil be road tripping in this car a lot that is very important.

However, one reason why you might want to think twice is its power, or lack thereof. Not only does it have a rather paltry 141 hp (just barely above the class low Chevy Trax), but much of that power doesn't arrive until the 1.8-liter four-cylinder winds up to higher engine speeds. The result is loud droning noises from the CVT, and vibrations felt through the steering wheel and gas pedal. Even though its 0-60-mph time of 9.7 seconds isn't that much slower than others in the segment, in real-world driving, its dearth of low- end power (a meek 127 lb-ft of torque at a lofty 4,300 rpm) makes it feel substantially slower.

 Update-2015 Honda Fit at 60,000+ miles
 Silverfit15,09/24/2015
 LX 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 4cyl CVT)
 I purchased my 2015 Fit LX in mid August 2014. Going from a Toyota Corolla to a Fit was a pleasure. Nothing wrong with the Toyota, but it is more an appliance than a car. Great transportation and comfort-but very boring to drive. The Fit is just the opposite. While the car has a CVT transmission, it is still quick, responsive and fund to drive. The Fit holds the road better than you would think for an economy car, but with a composed and compliant ride for it's size. Everyone who has seen the Fit is impressed with how large it is inside compared to it's exterior dimensions.


--DocBreak--
As ever, one of the Fit's standout features is its so-called "Magic Seat," a uniquely constructed rear seat that includes a flip-up seat bottom to facilitate hauling behind the front seatbacks. Alternatively, you can leave that seat bottom down and fold the rear seatbacks forward, which opens up a cargo hold that'll give some small crossovers a run for their money. If you're upgrading from an older Fit model, you'll likely be impressed by newly available upgrades like leather upholstery and keyless ignition. Happily, core Fit features such as nimble handling and excellent visibility remain present and accounted for.

As a lease-only proposition with no buyout, Honda's Fit EV battery warranty lasts for "the duration of the lease of the vehicle," which is 3 years or 36,000 miles. Makers of for-sale EVs have to stand behind their batteries far longer, so in theory they can't push them to the max. One wonders if an 8-year/100,000-mile Fit EV battery would perform as well. It seems so, but outside of Honda there's no way of knowing.

All models also get a rear back-up camera, while EX and above models add Honda's Lane Watch system. It shows your blind spot on the dashboard screen when the passenger side turn signal is activated.

While the new engine isn't really more potent on paper, in the real world its direct fuel-injection technology helps give the Fit a snappier feel when driving around town. Shifting the new six-speed manual transmission is a breeze. You'll likely be just as happy with the new CVT. It swiftly "downshifts" when you need quick acceleration, unlike some other CVTs, which seem to produce more noise than action.
 ## Interior
 The former Fit's cabin design was lacking in terms of its overall materials quality as well as the look and feel of various knobs and switches. It simply fell short of competitors like the Accent or Fiesta. The 2015 Fit, however, makes a large leap inside, drawing a more modern and updated feel from Honda's Civic and Accord. It's also roomier than ever before. The expansive amount of rear seat space -- there's more rear legroom than in the Accord -- means comfortable seating for two tall adults and/or easy installation of child safety seats.

Other that a dear hitting the car along the passenger side of the car at 60 MPH, the car has had no issues. I have also done my oil changes, which is fairly easy, even though you need to remove the engine splash pan to get to the drain and filter. I travel 110 mile each day to work and back home. My average MPG has ranged from 42 to 45.5 in all kinds of weather, with the A/C both on and off. My friends with hybrids can't believe the mileage I get, and the cost of the car was nowhere near what they paid. As for front seat comfort, I have no complaints. I spend almost three hours each day in the Fit, and at no time find myself uncomfortable. Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to go with a Fit, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good blend of economy, performance and utility in a small package.


--DocBreak--
There's nothing else quite like the Fit on the market, but there are a few other subcompact hatchbacks that do certain things well. The funky Kia Soul, for example, actually has a bit more cargo capacity than the Honda, though its fuel economy is distinctly inferior. The 2016 Ford Fiesta hatchback is fuel- efficient and fun to drive, but its backseat and cargo area are both pretty tight. The four-door version of the Toyota Yaris hatchback is a solid offering that compares well on many fronts, but its cargo capacity just isn't in the same league. At the end of the day, if you're looking for versatility and efficiency on a budget, no other subcompact comes close to the aptly named 2016 Honda Fit.

Another area that the HRV seems to get complaints is in the touch control climate/entertainment console. When I first got the car, it did bother me a bit. Not knowing where everything was meant looking down and trying to figure it all out. However, after a week with it, using the touchscreen climate and radio controls becomes second nature and I enjoy the tech look of it. Admittedly I am a technophile. Reading other reviews, it seems many of those purchasing this car might have been older, so figuring this all out might have been more of a nuisance for them.
