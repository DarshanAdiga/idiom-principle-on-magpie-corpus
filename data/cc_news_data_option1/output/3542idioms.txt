That’s what the word “blessing” talks about in today’s passage. We must long to have the seal of approval from God for everything we undertake. If we fall into the trap of thinking that what the people around me think of me is more important than what God thinks of me, we will move away from the blessing of the Lord.

They further stated that the police press statement on July 27 does not state the offence which he was wanted for hence no basis to surrender himself to the police.      "Even then, there is nothing ex facie the press statement that appellant was sought in connection with the commission of any offence. Instead, he was being sought on account of being an activist which in itself is not an offence. No legal obligation arises for one to surrender self to the police merely on account of being labelled an activist by the police," they argued.      Sikhala had disputed hiding in the ceiling because of his big frame, but the court said there was no reason to believe the arresting officer Collin Makore would lie against him as it has been shown that good relations existed between the two.      He also claimed to have gone to Tynwald to collect his wife, which the court said could not be accepted as he was found hiding.      In the bail appeal filed at the High Court, his lawyers argued that Sikhala was entitled to freedom of movement and it was, therefore, neither here nor there that he was arrested in Tynwald.      Sikhala said he is prepared to deposit $15 000 as bail and also to reside at his St Mary's home until the matter is finalised.

In short, we tend to be ruled by fear rather than compassion.
 Jesus challenges our fear in the “Parable of the Good Samaritan” (Luke 10:25-37). A religious leader asked Jesus to define “neighbor” so he could limit whom he loved. Jesus responded with the story of an anonymous, unidentifiable person who was robbed, beaten, and left for dead. Two highly esteemed religious leaders refused to stop and help. Perhaps they feared a dangerous trap or an expensive hassle.
