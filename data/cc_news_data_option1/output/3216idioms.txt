The letter to the NA also pointed to the sharp rise of COVID infections: ‘The rate at which COVID 19 is spreading poses a present and clear danger to the very existence of The Gambia for which there is an urgent need to mobilize and organize all citizens and institutions to confront this menace. Ultimately, it is the National Assembly, which bears the primary responsibility to monitor and support the Executive to ensure that it carries out its functions to address the challenges facing the country. It is precisely for this reason that we are of the view that where the Executive is unable to adequately perform its sacred duty in salvaging the nation, then the National Assembly Members should assume their full responsibilities and powers to support the Assembly save the nation and her peoples.’ A view that points to a total failure in leadership from the Executive.

SpaceX and NASA will launch their next batch of astronauts to the International Space Station "no earlier" than October 23, the space agency announced on Friday.
 That pushes back the anticipated start date of the Crew-1 mission, which was originally slated to launch as early as late September.
 Crew-1 is technically SpaceX's first official, contracted astronaut mission for NASA, since the one it recently completed was a demonstration. The successful completion of that test, called Demo-2, paved the way for at least six more planned ISS missions as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
 NASA said in a press release that it pushed back the launch "to best meet the needs of the International Space Station" by coordinating with the schedules of other astronauts going to and from the ISS. That includes NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who are slated to blast off on a Russian Soyuz rocket on October 14. The Crew-1 mission will also wait for NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner to return to Earth from the space station on October 22.

With a new moon Aug. 18, we have the promise of skies as dark as they get, offering a view of the Milky Way.      A view from a truly dark rural site on a very clear night can be astonishing for anyone not accustomed to such skies. The billowing Milky Way arches through the summer evening sky, with a myriad stars - ranging from bright to very dim, sparkling over your head and on every side.      Yet it's a great time to look even in semi-rural conditions. The Milky Way is so bright, it may still be dimly seen, and the constellations are impressive as always.      Note: A hazy atmosphere will hide most of the Milky Way. Also, avoid street, town and neighborhood lights as much as you can.      Most brilliant of all this summer is the planet Jupiter and, to the left of it, planet Saturn, also very bright. Our giant neighbors in the outer solar system stand out in 2020, beacons of the night sky and easily seen even in an urban sky.      Do what you can to trace the Milky Way. Looking at around 10 p.m. in mid- August, once the sky is dark, the Milky Way stretches from the northeast, creating a backdrop for the famous W-shape of the constellation Cassiopeia, reaching overhead through the Northern Cross (part of Cygnus the Swan), down through Aquilia the Eagle and leading to Sagittarius and Scorpius in the south (low in the south if viewed from mid-northern latitudes).      It is here, in the area of Sagittarius, where the Milky Way is widest. We are literally looking at the central hub of the great spiral galaxy where we live, known collectively as the Milky Way.      The rest of the Milky Way band, which completely encircles the sky, is made up of the spiral arms of this galaxy. The sun and its planets - including Earth - is right in the midst of these arms, about halfway from the edge towards the central hub. We have an inside look at the arms, which from our perspective are overlapping and blend together.      With even a simple pair of binoculars or a telescope of any size, sweep across the Milky Way and see how this hazy band bursts into faint stars. Obviously, the larger the telescope and depending on how dark and clear your skies are, the more you will see and enjoy.      Part of Sagittarius constellation, the stars marking the outline of the "Teapot" is well placed, with the puffy-appearing Milky Way seeming to rise like celestial steam from the Teapot's "spout."      Just with the naked eye, observe how the Milky Way band is curiously split as you look up from the southern sky and Sagittarius, up through Aquilia and Cygnus.      What you are seeing is not a gap, but evidence of a cast, dark nebula of dust obscuring the light of the distant spiral arm stars in the background. You may be a fastidious housekeeper and keep chasing away dust bunnies, but the fact is, dust is everywhere. Dust, as well as gas, permeates the galaxy; from certain nebulous regions, stars are formed.      As you explore the Milky Way deeper with binoculars or a telescope, you can find many more dark nebulae, which are plotted on detailed star atlases.      Also abundant through the Milky Way band are star clusters, some rich and bright, some sparse, some dim and small, but each fascinating to fathom and compare. These star clusters are gatherings of stars, siblings as it were, from the same nebulous star cradle, on their journey in space - bound by gravitation and, I like to muse, mutual affection.      Look for the many-colored stars. White, blue-white, orange and red are common. They bespeak of stellar "life cycles" and variations in temperature, luminosity, chemical makeup and age. Many stars vary in brightness. We are also concluding that most may have planets of their own, evoking our imagination.      Use a star map to delve into the central hub, in the south on a mid-August evening. There are several bright and beautiful nebulous clouds (with names such as the Lagoon, Trifid, Horseshoe and Eagle), "star clouds" and amazing star clusters.   Jupiter and Saturn adds to the heavenly show, to the left of the "Teapot."      This show is free and waiting for you to go out and see.      Keep looking up at the stars!

On Social Security's 85th birthday, many older Pennsylvanians find themselves deferring retirement or coming to grips with unexpected unemployment. As we grapple with the abrupt changes brought on by coronavirus, it is clear we must maintain Social Security's hard-earned benefit for millions of older Americans and their families. This week, AARP wrote to President Trump asking him to explain his plan to replace Social Security funding.
   
 According to a new AARP survey, a significant majority of Americans - Republicans (93%), Democrats (99%), and Independents (92%) alike - see Social Security as an important government program, and more than half (56%) say it is even more important in light of the pandemic. With so many Americans struggling to afford health care and other basic needs, it is clear that the earned benefits Social Security provides is more important than ever.
   
 AARP is fighting to protect Pennsylvania voters 50-plus in this election and make voters' voices heard on the issues that matter most to them. To win in 2020, candidates need to tell voters how they will protect the future of Social Security and must have a solution to keep Social Security strong. We will never stop fighting to strengthen Social Security, and make sure hard- working Americans get the benefits they've earned.

BILLINGS - According to ACLU Montana, a Montana Department of Labor and Industry administrative judge ruled Friday that Yellowstone County discriminated against a then-county employee who is a transgender woman.
 The ACLU of Montana says the court's decision protects transgender and non- binary individuals in Montana from discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, education and finance.
 In June 2018, Maloney received a notice denying payment for her therapy services from the county's benefits administrator. They said the sessions were not covered by the Yellowstone County Group Health Benefits plan because the plan excludes coverage for "services or supplies related to sexual reassignment and reversal of such procedures."
 The court ruled in favor of Maloney, finding she is protected under the Montana Human Rights Act, prohibiting employers from gender identity discrimination. The court stated: “the Plan’s ‘sexual reassignment’ exclusion violates the MHRA because it denies coverage to those of transgender status on the basis of sex.”
 “This ruling is a huge step on a long road to end all types of discrimination against transgender and non-binary people in Montana and ensure that they feel safe and welcome in Montana’s communities,” said Alex Rate, ACLU of Montana Legal Director. “Nobody should be discriminated against because of who they are.”
 The court extended the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court _Stephens v. Harris Funeral Home_ ruling, saying employers cannot legally discriminate against gender identity.
 In September 2017, Maloney was diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria. In December of 2017, Eleanor began therapeutic counseling for treatment of her gender dysphoria.
 "I think it's life saving to have access to gender affirming healthcare. Don't actually know how to explain it people are trapped, but there's something that's always wrong from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep and therapy can help you put the pieces together," said Maloney.
 ACLU of Montana says the county covered her therapeutic counseling, until they found out the sessions were for treatment of gender dysphoria.
 "Yellowstone County refused to provide coverage for any gender affirming care at all including Eleanor's therapy visits simply because the care was related to her being transgender," said Elizabeth Ehret, Maloney's lawyer with ACLU of Montana.

Every situation is different depending on need, expenses and income. A general rule is that saving 15–20% of your income is helpful. Keep in mind that this percentage includes income directed toward retirement accounts as well. If the goal of putting money into savings is to save for an emergency, then the goal is to reach a set amount first and not necessarily to focus on the percentage. Setting a savings goal of $500–1,000 is a great starting point. Then, transition into a second savings goal, such as saving one month of expenses, and then increase it to a third goal of saving three months of expenses. You can continuously expand the goal to reach 6–9 months of expenses and eventually have a full emergency fund.

So that's what I did, and I found an adjustment that makes my music sound amazing _to me,_ and it was pretty easy and quick. In fact, my own customization turned the XM4 into a pair of headphones that are going to be hard to replace. It was worth going into the app and playing around with the sound settings, as I prefer the way the XM4 sound compared to the Bose. (If you're curious, I use the "Bright" preset, and set the "Clear Bass" to +5 or more.)
 Some don't really care too much and just want a pair of headphones that they're told sound good without fiddling around in an app, and for those people, I'd suggest the $400 Bose 700 that can often be had for less. They offer excellent sound out of the box.
 ## Noise cancellation and battery life
 Noise cancellation on the XM4 is excellent and on par with Bose, which have set the standard for noise-cancelling wireless headphones with the Quiet Comfort line, and most recently its 700 line.
 In an office-type environment at about 53 decibels, including air conditioning droning and a couple of loud fans, I could listen to music at significantly lower volumes than without noise cancelling. The ambient noise from the air conditioning and fans, and even the sound of my wife on a phone call in the same room was all but forgotten while listening to music.

"We won the war. Now watch us build!"
   
 Dover, New Hampshire in August 1957 was thriving. Factories were running at full tilt, some on three shifts. Others ran two shifts plus overtime. This was the industrial rolling thunder model of small post-war American cities.
   
 There were no malls then. The business district on both sides of Central Avenue, Dover's main thoroughfare was teeming. The Upper and Lower Squares were packed with storefronts. Everything had its own specialty store: Hooz Ladies Clothing, JJ Newberry's, Rivers Camera, Western Auto and Harvey's Bakery to name a few. On a Friday afternoon, you were hard pressed to find a parking space.
   
 Our neighbor, Mildred Haendler, told Mom that Farnham's in Dover sold high- quality clothing at reasonable prices. "They are the nicest people. You should take the children there for school clothes. If you tell me when you're going, I'll call ahead for you." Mom agreed and Mildred placed the call.
   
 In the 1950s, families did not go out in public unless they were properly dressed in "clean clothes with no holes." Visiting a clothing store imposed a special requirement. You respected the merchant and his wares. It would be unseemly not to have bathed and then try on clothing that someone else might buy later.
   
 The day before, Mom washed all of our "town clothes" and dried them on the clothesline. That night, she straightened my sisters' hair with combs heated on the kitchen stove. Dad gave Ted and me "old school haircuts" with a pair of scissors and a comb.
   
 It was a clear, hot Friday about 3 p.m. on that August day in 1957. But not overly hot; the heat had broken earlier. Dad eased the '49 Mercury Flathead V8 Coupe into an angled parking space in front of Farnhams' clothing store on the Lower Square. I was the smallest, so I sat in the front between my parents.
   
 Dad said, "Michael get out on the side with your mother." He climbed out of the driver's side and locked the door. He came around the front of the car and opened the door. He deployed us with military precision, speaking crisply to my brother. "Ted, step up on the sidewalk! Michael stay right here by the door. Girls stay with your mother."
   
 Then he walked around the car making sure the windows were shut and the trunk was locked. I didn't know it until much later in life, but Dad was "clearing his six."
   
 "Dad?" Ted looked back over his shoulder.
   
 "Yes, Ted, right there. That's good."
   
 Then, as Mom later recounted, "Traffic came to a screeching halt."
   
 It was dead silent for a moment as the drivers processed what they were seeing.
   
 The store manager, a tall, bald, whiplike man, hurried out, "You must be the Wards!"
   
 Finally, traffic began to roll again, albeit more slowly. Then a voice bellowed, "Hey look! Some niggers!"
   
 Dad pivoted to face the source of the threat. The car was on the outer lane from where he stood. "You son of a bitch."
   
 His rage was apparent. It guaranteed anyone exiting that car was going to be "well employed" for several minutes. But the store manager was surprisingly fast. Sprinting out he caught Dad by the arm. "This is my town; I'll handle this."
   
 He strode out into the street imperiously and pointed at the car. As he moved toward it, the driver must have sensed trouble. He grabbed first gear, goosed it, and the car scuttled away. Then the manager did a surprising thing. He ran down the street after the car. He was breathing hard when he came back up the street.
   
 "He isn't going to get away with that. We don't treat people like that here. But I got his plate number. I got his plate. They'll be hearing from the police."
   
 Meanwhile, a steady stream of people moved to and fro on the sidewalk. For the most part, they looked at us curiously. A man in a yellow shirt walking by smiled and said, "Good afternoon. Where are you folks from?"
   
 "We live in Lee," replied Dad coolly.
   
 "Well I live over in Rollinsford. Glad you folks are here." He shook Dad's hand and went on his way.
   
 A middle-aged woman walked toward us well-dressed in a pastel blue suit. Her dark hair was styled in a bouffant. She wore a faux pearl necklace, a pill box hat and carried a clutch purse. Glaring at us she voiced a very different point of view. "Trash", she muttered.
   
 It was just loud enough for Mom to hear. She stepped up on the sidewalk and stared back at her with the superior level of ferocity that only a woman raised in Atlantic City and Brooklyn can deliver. The woman flushed from the intensity of her gaze. Thus silenced, she slithered away.
   
 A break appeared in the sidewalk traffic. The store manager waved us over to the door. "Come on, let's get out of this heat into my store. We've got air conditioning!"
   
 "Ted, don't let anyone within six feet of your mother, sisters or brother. Go on 'Gin.'"
   
 Mom led the flying wedge formation. The manager held up his hand like a traffic cop. He blocked people coming up the sidewalk on the left. Ted stood with his arms extended straight out from his sides, fencing off folks coming down the street from the right.
   
 As a unit, we moved into the store. Dad took up station as the rear guard. He walked backwards behind us into the store. His head pivoted like a turret, staring down anyone thinking about getting too close.
   
 Once inside, the manager said, "I didn't recognize the car. They must be some out of town third-shift people. They aren't real Dover people. We aren't like that… I'm very sorry about that, Mr. and Mrs. Ward."
   
 Then he turned to Dad and asked,, "Are you a veteran?"
   
 "Yes, U.S. Navy active duty."
   
 "Well, I served too. I'm sorry and I apologize."
   
 Smoothly and as gracefully as always, Mom interceded. "We understand that it's hard for some people here."

Thomspon said the offer likely would have brought in more money for the city in the long run although it didn't pay the property's value up front.
 "Council felt it was a serious offer to consider, but they thought the property had more value on the short term," Thompson said. "However, there was long-term benefit to the immediate area, but also to the city from a sales tax and a property tax component."
 Some council members also felt that it would be unfair to consider a second offer from the brewery while the highest bidder already had been selected.
 The real estate agent has valued the property at $74,500 and will open bids for a six-month period, although that entire time may not be needed.
 Ultimately, the council will vote on which buyer, and potential use, the building will go toward.
