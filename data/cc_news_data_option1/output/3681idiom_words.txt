Leeds' versatile wing-back Stuart Dallas was top of the tackling charts, putting in seven blocks against the Reds.
 Just behind him, with six, was Luke Ayling.
 Pascal Struijk and Mateusz Klich both earned plaudits for their performances in the curtain-raiser and they chipped in with four tackles each.
 Crucially, Struijk made three interceptions - the most of any Leeds player.
