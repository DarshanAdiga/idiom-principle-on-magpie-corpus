I had spent years building behind the scenes. Copywriting, pricing, designing, production, tax registrations, photography, SEO, online marketing, social media, basic bookkeeping– these were now all a part of my business toolkit. But when it came to holding my own in a room full of what _“successful business women”_ looked like?

 The Ashland County Class B basketball league began in 1929 and lasted until 1963, when consolidation began to eliminate the smaller high schools.  
 The competitors included the Ruggles Indians and Nova Trojans (until those two schools joined together as the Ruggles-Troy Golden Flashes) the Sullivan Bobcats, Polk Presidents, Savannah Sailors, Jeromesville Blue Jays, Hayesville Panthers, Perrysville Admirals and Loudonville Red Birds. Albion and Nankin, which had no nicknames, only participated through the mid-1930s, and the Montgomery Mounties had no high school so they only played in the junior high league.  
 A website covering Ashland County sports history that Paul Dienstberger put together several years ago gives lots of interesting details about the league. You can find it at www.ashlandcohssportsteams.com.  
 According to Dienstberger, at the league's founding, schools were required to have a gymnasium. However, games were sometimes played under exotic conditions. At times, Jeromesville played in a barn, Hayesville in a church and Nankin had no gym at all. At Sullivan, heating ducts in the ceiling made it challenging to take long shots, while players also contended with cables at the Polk armory.  
 The size of the gymnasiums varied. In some the center jump circle overlapped the foul lines, and sometimes the baskets were mounted on the end walls. The Perrysville floor was adequate, but the lighting reportedly was not. In the mid-1950s, Savannah's new regulation-sized gym and glass backboards made it the envy of the league.  
 In 1956, the Loudonville Red Birds reached the final 16 in the state high school tournaments for the second time. They had appeared before in 1941, losing the first game. The first Ashland County team to reach that level had been Nova, in 1939, when it also lost in the first round.  
 In 1960, the Times-Gazette published an article under the heading: \"Wonder what's really in a name? Plenty -- that's what.\" Apparently, the reporters had started referring to Ruggles-Troy as Nova, since the school building stood in that village. This aroused complaints from residents and officials in the district, which had consolidated in 1949. The editor capitulated, promising to use only the correct term, Ruggles-Troy.  
 The county league held a basketball tournament every year in the Ashland College gymnasium. Although there had been tourneys prior to the founding of the league, Polk defeated Loudonville in the title game in 1930 to win the first official league tournament.  
 In 1937, the tournament brought in $444 in ticket sales. The balance, after covering expenses, was divided among the participating schools according to how many games they played. The top four finishers got $33 each, while the other schools received $11 for playing one game apiece.  
 In February of 1962, the 33rd and final basketball tournament was played in the college gymnasium. Jeromesville drubbed Polk to kick off the tournament on a Friday night. Properly called the Blue Jays, the press informally referred to Jeromesville as the Jerries, while Polk was shortened to Prexies.  
 On Saturday, Ruggles-Troy upset the Hayesville Panthers. The Golden Flashes came off a dismal season with only three wins, but they beat the Panthers by one point after a desperation shot failed to hit the target in the final seconds.  
 In the finals, one week later, the Flashes took on the Blue Jays. The Jerries won, 53-50.

"They write great scripts, they tell great stories, but they also know how to write for each actor. They all have, and Jesse in particular, an amazing 'bullshit-ometer.' He knows if something is a little too far or a little on the nose, so I am in completely safe hands. There's a lot about Roman, well most of how I approach Roman, is not at all this," the actor explains, gesturing to his head. "It's all gut," he adds. "It's all like I read the page, it feels right and if it doesn’t then I will express myself and then it feels like I'm heard in this collaboration. It's not a struggle. I'm never fighting to make sure I have a voice. I'm never fighting to try to understand who this guy is. We all seem to have a really good understanding of what it is and we all have a lot of trust."

There are subtle reactions you should look out for, so whenever you talk to a teen, certain gestures or expressions can give you a good (although rough) idea about a teen’s behavioral patterns. Tapping the finger or blinking repeatedly are just some actions that give away a certain feeling or sentiment.

Jameela Jamil bid goodbye to her first-ever acting job when NBC's "The Good Place" concluded with its fourth and final season earlier this year. While she and the rest of the cast had advanced notice that Season 4 would be the show's last, it didn't make it any easier saying goodbye to her character, Tahani. […]

Critics say "Hamilton" is a great musical. That kinda goes without saying at this point, but such a well-known property could have been received with a relative shrug in its filmed version premiering on Disney+ on July 3. If you haven't seen it on stage there's a decent chance you've listened to the cast recording, which is _still_ on the Billboard charts after 248 weeks -- been there, done that. But reviewers are just as enthusiastic about the musical onscreen as they were onstage.

Each volume or cycle of "Patriot Act" consists of roughly six to eight episodes that premiere weekly, tackling topics stateside (for example "The Broken Policing System," "Trump's Worst Policy: Killing Asylum" and "How Coronavirus Broke America") and overseas (for example "The Two Sides of Canada," "The Real Cost of Cruises" and "The Ugly Truth of Fast Fashion"). The show presents each issue from a unique point of view, influenced by Minhaj's age (he's 34) and his first-generation Indian-American heritage. It delves into themes that are familiar across the variety talk show genre like the Trump presidency, the global pandemic and social media, but it also branches out into topics rarely seen on American television. It also delivers its facts and arguments by deploying ambitious and engaging visual graphics and a tone that pivots from sarcastic to earnest depending on the subject matter, all of which suits Minhaj's comedic style to a tee.

Jamil has found herself positively changed by her experience on "The Good Place," which deals with big philosophical concepts of life and death. The process has taught her to not care so much what other people think, mirroring Tahani's own journey to stop seeking validation from others. Jamil relates the comedy series to the current moment. "You take people from very different backgrounds, from very different up brings who are very, very different people and they put their differences aside in order to work together to get to a better place," describes Jamil. "If ever there was a more potent message for what we need to do now in such a divisive moment, 'The Good Place' was spelling it out all along."
