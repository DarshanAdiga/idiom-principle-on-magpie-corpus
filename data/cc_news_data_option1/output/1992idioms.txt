“Guess I’ll have to go to plan B” is a common expression all of us use when it’s obvious that what we are trying to do is not working and we need to try something else. I’m guessing just about every farmer in Barnes County would say that 2019 was a year they had to go to “Plan B” more often than they ever have in their farming career. For example, 2020 will be the first spring some will have newly planted corn plants emerging in fields that are next to last years unharvested corn. Let’s quit looking in the rearview mirror and take a look at 2020. What I hear from visiting with Barnes County farmers is that for 2020 many have a plan I’m calling “ABC.”

Is it really necessary for me to remove my cloth face mask when I’m around other people?” Hicks asked.We’re told Jefferson County Health Officer Dr. Mark Wilson is expected to hold a news conference Friday to update the situation in Jefferson County.Copyright 2020 WBRC.

“It’s the right thing to do,” Snelling said.
 Ashby called on Aldridge, who was also attending the virtual meeting, and asked if she would accept the nomination.
 “I would be honored,” Aldridge said.
 The nomination would be voted on at the June 2 town meeting.
 Also at the work session, Charlene Notarcola, Cecil County Clerk of the Court, was on hand to swear Snelling and Taylor into office. Taylor won re-election while Snelling, appointed last August to finish Ray Ryan’s term, won his first election. Taylor told Snelling to take his oath first.
 “You go first alphabetically but you also got the most votes,” Taylor said.
 In a statement after the swearing-in was complete, Snelling thanked all the voters who, in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic, came to the polls to vote in person. He also gave credit to town staff who made the election safe with the construction of barriers for social distancing.
 “I want to thank the election board who had to endure a long day in masks and did an excellent job,” Snelling said.
 Snelling also wanted to call attention to the late Alan Fox, a former Perryville town commissioner and author of a book about the town. He vowed to continue his friend’s efforts to celebrate and remember the town’s history but also move Perryville forward.
 Ashby kept Taylor as the board representative to Water and Wastewater and held Linkey’s assignments to Department of Public Works and Parks and Recreation. He also maintained his post as board representative to Public Safety, but moved Snelling to Planning and Zoning.
