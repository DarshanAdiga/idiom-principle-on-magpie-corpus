Can you style it to create endless looks? Elements like side slits in our shirt that ensure various ways to tuck and tie; our grosgrain coat detail with hidden belt loops so you can wear with or without a belt; thoughtful button placement on our blazer and shirt so you are showing just the right amount of skin; extra long zippers on our dress so you can step into it instead of putting it over your head; inside shoulder snaps on our sweater to prevent slipping; necklines that can be worn backwards or forwards. I have even seen our blazer worn inside-out because the details on the inside are just as special as the outside.

In Modena today, tradition dictates that when a girl is born, a row of vinegar barrels is set up. When the girl gets married, those well-aged barrels become her dowry.
 In 1863, one of Giuseppe Giusti‚Äôs forebears presented a paper during a trade show in Modena, defining balsamic vinegar and how to make it. He specified which types of grapes to use, and even what type of wood to make the aging barrels. At that time, the correct barrels had to be 20 years old, and the vinegar needed to live in the barrels a minimum of two years.
 Paraphrased through generations, his instructions were to use juniper wood or a non-aromatic wood such as mulberry in the beginning, and oak at the end. In the middle, use cherry or chestnut. It‚Äôs important that the vinegar tastes of all the different woods that house it. Giusti explains that after 15 years the vinegar begins to get good, and after 30 years much better. After 50 years, it deserves the name balsamic.
 This 150-year-old trade show speech is still known and widely quoted today as The Giusti Recipe. Today, balsamic vinegar can be made in just 60 days. Of course, the longer the product sits in the barrels, the more special it becomes.
 In the Giusti family barrel rooms in Modena, no barrel is less than 100 years old. In fact, some of the barrels occasionally require renovation.
 ‚ÄúIf a barrel falls apart,‚Äù says Giusti, ‚Äúyou have to build a new barrel around it, so as not to disturb the product.‚Äù
 The price of good balsamic vinegar begins at $20 and can range upward to $300, but much like fine wine, there is often no real way to determine if the liquid inside the bottle is superior or not.
 ‚ÄúIn the final analysis, balsamic is a condiment,‚Äù says Giusti. ‚ÄúYou can classify it one way or the other, but you just never know its quality until you taste it.‚Äù

Holder Owen Menge motioned for the ball to be snapped and Washburn started her approach. But then calamity ensued, and the snap nearly sailed over Menge‚Äôs head. By the time he had the ball in his hands, the Cardinals' defensive front was already in the Columbia backfield. An opportunity denied for Washburn.
 Shortly after, Washburn got a second chance. Menge broke loose for a 45-yard touchdown run. This time the snap was fine, but Washburn, still thinking about the misfire on the previous attempt, was a little more hesitant approaching the ball and the kick was blocked.
 Although Washburn didn‚Äôt record a point in the Raiders' win, the freshman became the first girl in Columbia history to appear in a football game.
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd never had a girl suit up before. So it was kind of neat to be able to give her that opportunity,‚Äù Ward said. ‚ÄúI just wish it would have gone better. It‚Äôs hard to get that timing down.‚Äù

 Sir David Attenborough, the naturalist behind dozens of documentaries chronicling the planet‚Äôs biodiversity, has joined a council overseeing the prize and helped promote its launch through promotional videos and joint interviews with William.
 William said the ‚ÄúEarthshot Prize‚Äù was inspired by President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs launch in 1961 of a decadelong research program, ‚ÄúMoonshot,‚Äù to send the first person to the moon.
 It will comprise five awards of 1 million pounds each for each of the next 10 years, centered on ‚Äúearthshots,‚Äù or goals ‚Äî fixing the climate, cleaning the air, protecting and restoring nature, reviving oceans, and tackling waste.
 ‚ÄúWe have to have a decade of change, a decade of repairing the planet so we can hand it on to the next generation and future generations,‚Äù William said, adding that he didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúlet down‚Äù his children by not acting.
 ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want to inherit a world that is full of doom and gloom,‚Äù he said.

While five Michigan men and one man from Delaware are facing life sentences on multiple federal charges, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued charges against seven men including Eric Molitor of Cadillac.
 Molitor was charged with one count of terrorist acts ‚Äî providing material support, and felony firearms for his connection with an incident occurring on or about Nov. 1, 2019-Oct. 7, 2020 in Elk Rapids Township in Antrim County. In the court documents shared by Nessel's office, it stated the terrorist act charge alleges Molitor did knowingly provide material support or resources to a terrorist or terrorist organization to be used in whole or in part, to plan, prepare, carry out, facilitate or avoid apprehension for committing an act of terrorism against the United States or its citizens, Michigan or its citizens or a political subdivision or any other instrumentality of this state or a local unit government.
 The affidavit associated with the charges brought against Molitor state on Aug. 29, Molitor, among others, conducted surveillance of Whitmer‚Äôs vacation home. It is alleged Molitor used his cell phone to find the location and took photographs. He further discussed with others about conducting surveillance from water at a later date, according to the affidavit.
 If convicted of the terrorist act, Molitor faces up to 20 years in prison and/or $20,000 in fines. The felony firearms offense, however, is punishable by up to two years in prison consecutive with and preceding any term imposed by additional convictions.
 The charges in question are only accusations. Molitor is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law. The prosecution has the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

CNN) ‚Äî President Donald Trump, in a reversal of position, has told allies he's interested in a large-scale stimulus deal, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments.
 The person stressed it's unclear what, exactly, Trump's vision of a comprehensive deal would entail, and there remain significant hurdles ‚Äî and skepticism ‚Äî when it comes to reaching an agreement through talks that have been largely stuck in the same place for several months.
 But for Trump, who faced dropping markets and criticism from within his own party for his decision to abruptly end talks earlier this week, it marks another turn in the long-shot negotiations.
 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in a call with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday, said Trump was now interested in coming back to the table on a comprehensive agreement, according to Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff. But even that was called into question by Pelosi on the call, who noted that another White House official had earlier Thursday afternoon "contradicted that assertion." But Mnuchin assured the California Democrat the president was interested in a comprehensive deal. Pelosi, on a call with her leadership team later in the afternoon, said she believed the talks were back on, according to a source familiar with the call.
 The stakes are, as they have been for months, enormous. The pandemic, which is still surging in parts of the country, has left unemployment significantly elevated, cratered small businesses through the US and presented significant budget shortfalls for states and localities. There have also been significant requests for resources by schools and public health officials to confront the fallout from the virus.
 The development marks the completion of a head-spinning 48 hours. Trump, on Tuesday, took to Twitter to call off the stimulus talks entirely, sending markets into a dive. Eight hours later, he called for piecemeal legislation to address the economic hardship created by the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äî something Democrats have repeatedly rejected. By Wednesday night, Mnuchin called Pelosi and said the President was interested in coming back to the table, according to a person familiar with their conversation.
 Throughout the past few days, White House officials have said repeatedly that negotiations on a comprehensive deal were over and the preferred pathway was a series of smaller-scale bills.
 Now, the president is once again open to a bigger deal.
 Pelosi, who has repeatedly rejected GOP efforts to push piecemeal bills and did so once again on Thursday when it came to moving forward on a bill to provide payroll support for airlines, has said Democrats would remain at the table in case the White House returned ‚Äî but that any agreement would need to be comprehensive.
 "Let's take a serious, not a skinny, not an emaciated but a serious, appropriate approach, to crushing the virus," Pelosi told reporters.
 The hurdles remain significant. Congressional Republicans have made clear they are wary of going anywhere near the $2.2 trillion proposal Democrats have put on the table. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, shortly after Trump called off the negotiations, said he agreed with the decision and has made clear, both publicly and privately to Trump himself, that many Senate Republicans were uncomfortable with the direction negotiations with Pelosi had been heading.
 "The discussion from day to day can be confusing for all of us to follow," McConnell said of the roller-coaster that has been stimulus talks over the last several weeks. The Kentucky Republican has long said he's in favor of another rescue package, but has also made clear the differences between the two sides remain significant.
 "We do agree that another rescue package is needed," McConnell said Thursday. "We have vast differences about how much we should spend."
 Pelosi, for months, has made clear that the scale of the crisis ‚Äî both on the economic and public health side of things ‚Äî requires significant investment and the House passed a $2.2 trillion measure last week. Senate Republicans proposed a roughly $500 billion bill last month, which was blocked by Senate Democrats.
 Mnuchin had put roughly $1.6 trillion on the table in the negotiations Trump short-circuited this week, but multiple people involved said Pelosi had made clear she was not going below $2 trillion given her view of the scale of the problems that needed to be addressed.
 But beyond the need to reach an agreement on the topline number, the actual details and legislative language of a comprehensive agreement also remain far from completion, and would likely represent the most complex part of any negotiation.
 There's also the issue of timing. Election Day is less than a month away, the House is out of session for the time being and the Senate, which has faced a mini-coronavirus outbreak of its own, is expected to return before the election primarily to focus on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.
