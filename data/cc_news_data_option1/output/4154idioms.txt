Two of Europe's biggest capitals are in trouble as Paris imposed overnight curfews and London considered banning people from meeting indoors to combat the spread of coronavirus. The French capital and the cities of Aix-Marseille, Grenoble, Montpellier, Toulouse, Saint Etienne, Lille, Rouen and Lyon will face a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew starting at midnight on Friday, President Emmanuel Macron announced. Violating the nighttime curfew will carry a fine of 135 euros (about $160) for a first offense, and 1500 euros ($1,760) if the offense is repeated. France reported 22,591 new cases and 95 deaths on Wednesday, bringing its total to 779,063 cases and 33,037 deaths. London will move to the Tier 2 \"high alert\" level of coronavirus restrictions on Saturday, Mayor Sadiq Khan announced in a statement posted on Twitter on Thursday. It means Londoners will be banned from mixing with other households indoors in any setting, including in pubs and restaurants. They should also avoid using public transport where possible.

Roma, 15 ott. (Adnkronos) - La produzione di piccoli satelliti "è il futuro", il trend del "settore industriale dei nano e micro-satelliti si sta rafforzando" per questo "spero molto che quando saranno annunciati o richiesti progetti" nel settore spaziale, per allocare risorse dei Recovery Fund, "ci sia un'apertura in questa direzione", anche perché "i nanosatelliti offrono tecnologie capaci di frenare il digital divide" di cui soffre il nostro Paese. E' Marco Villa, Ceo di Tyvak International, che, intervistato dall'Adnkronos, accende un faro sulle tecnologie spaziali in grado di ridurre il divario digitale, all'indomani del Dpcm che prevede, tra l'altro, una ulteriore estensione dello smart working. Una visione a tutto tondo quella di Marco Villa, i primi passi nel settore aerospaziale con la SpaceX di Elon Musk diventando Direttore delle operazioni della Missione Dragon, il veicolo spaziale portato per primo in orbita e riportato a Terra da una compagnia aerospaziale privata. "Oggi, per chiudere qualsiasi gap digitale - sia a livello di territorio che per quantità di dati trasmessi - si possono utilizzare piccoli satelliti in grado di coprire aree di dimensioni come tutto il Nord Italia" argomenta il Ceo. Tywak - società nata nel 2015 come startup presso I3P, l'incubatore di Imprese Innovative del Politecnico di Torino e oggi prima realtà internazionale del gruppo statunitense Terran Orbital Corporation - vanta oltre 200 piccoli satelliti lanciati in tutto il mondo. La società ha supportato più di 75 missioni governative e commerciali tra cui missioni di Nasa, Esa e Asi. "Siamo nati appena 5 anni fa ma stiamo crescendo molto, ci siamo subito orientati verso il mercato dei micro-nanosatelliti che riteniamo sia il futuro" spiega il Ceo.

We've always been on that grand scale, but I think we go to the next level in season three. It really is a movie every week with effects that rival blockbuster movies. It's just amazing.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio expanded on what he said is the “the fight we’re waging against a second wave of coronavirus,” noting that the city is seeing a “plateauing” in test results, though there is “more to do.” “A second wave would mean a lot shuts down, we go backwards, no one wants that. So we can stop this once and for all in these areas of Brooklyn and Queens where there’s concern and therefore protect the whole city, and that’s what we’re going to do,\" he added. He said officials are “flooding the zone” with testing. Test and Trace head Ted Long said in the last two weeks, more than 17,000 tests have been taken in the clusters. Thirty-two new test sites were built out in the clusters, including 18 in the red zones. A large testing site is open today at the Kew Gardens Hills Branch public library. The city is also partnering with Medicaid plans, which cover 1.2 million New Yorkers on testing outreach, de Blasio said. The Mayor said in terms of enforcement, 1700 inspections were done Wednesday, and 25 summons were issued. There have been over 18,000 in the last two weeks with a total of 288 summonses issued, including 11 summonses for $15,000.

Hoda Kotb reveals Frank Sinatra Jr. was the 'worst celebrity guest we've ever had, bar none' on the Today Show: 'He didn't want to talk about his book, so he didn't say anything'

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — An undetermined number of Ohio inmates who are serving additional time because firearms were involved in their crimes could see their sentences reduced in light of a recent court ruling, a top lawyer for the state prison system told The Associated Press. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction began a massive review of inmate case files Monday aimed at determining exactly how many prisoners' sentences may need to be adjusted as a result of the September decision, said Jocelyn Lowe, the department's assistant chief counsel. Three staffers have been assigned full-time to the job, she said, with the goal of getting the first letters laying out affected inmates' recalculated sentences to judges starting Friday. The judges will be asked to reply within 21 days. “For the new entry, they need to let us know if they think that they need to clarify the entry in order to make sure that it complies with their intent when they sentenced the individual,” Lowe said. The full review is expected to take through the end of the year. The undertaking was prompted by a Sept. 15 decision by the Ohio Supreme Court in the case of inmate Charles Fraley. He successfully challenged the way the state calculated his gun-related penalties, known as gun specifications, in a manner that the court agreed erroneously added three years to his sentence. Fraley, 64, began what had been a 13-year prison sentence at London Correctional Facility in 2011. After being convicted and paroled for earlier crimes, he was sent there on several new charges. In one case, he received a seven-year sentence plus a three-year gun penalty. In a separate case, he received five years plus a three-year gun penalty — with that whole second sentence “to be served concurrent” to...

A cold pack will compress the blood vessels which will slow down circulation. This in turn will reduce the swelling and numb the pain. You may use hot and cold therapy alternatively to get relief. But if you notice any injury in the skin stop immediately. Be careful not to use an ice pack for more than 10 minutes at a time.

dipped 1.76%. Jobless claims came in this morning at 898,000 above the estimated 830,000- the highest level since August 22. The Empire State Manufacturing Index also fell more than expected.

The fact that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that a stimulus deal was going to be “tough” to pass before the election did not help matters either. The spiking coronavirus cases in Europe combined with second lockdowns and pauses in clinical vaccine and antibody trials also contributed to the fear and negative sentiment this morning.
