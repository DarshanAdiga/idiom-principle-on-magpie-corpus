Among the significant benefits of precision cutting tools is that they improve the finishing of the products. This alone helps in cost savings. The absence of different types of cutting tools is limiting. This is particularly in light of less wasted materials. Defects caused by cutting errors attract losses in manufacturing businesses. Errors also weigh down quality, which eventually weighs down the returns of the company.

 Bayerns Ministerpräsident Markus Söder hat nach dem umstrittenen Auftritt von Ex-Weltmeister Thomas Berthold vor den Folgen solcher Aktionen in der Coronavirus-Pandemie gewarnt. „Wenn sogar ehemalige Nationalspieler sich irgendwelchen absurden Diskussionen anschließen, hat das übrigens auch eine ganz verheerende Wirkung. Was hat das für eine Wirkung auf Fußballfans, wenn ehemalige Fußball-Nationalspieler plötzlich dazu aufrufen, weder Masken zu tragen, noch Abstand zu halten?“, sagte der CSU-Politiker am Montag in Nürnberg.  
 \n
 Namentlich nannte Söder den ehemaligen Fußballprofi Berthold nicht. Der 55-jährige Berthold hatte am Samstag bei einer Demonstration gegen die Corona- Schutzmaßnahmen in Stuttgart eine Rede gehalten. Berthold möchte, dass dieser Auftritt nicht sein letzter in diesem Kontext war.

My recent ability to sit or recline for long periods of time without doing a blessed thing is an artifact of five months in the hospital last year. Lying in hospital beds I first lost interest in the Red Sox, then everything else on television and finally even reading. I didn’t even really relish visitors. I became perfectly content to lie motionless in bed waiting for something to happen. Vital signs. Grand rounds. Blood draw. CT scan. Lying very still I found that my body and its various aches and pains just melted away. I was reduced to my consciousness of self.

An Air India Express plane with 190 people on board, overshot the rain-soaked runway at an airport near the southern city of Kozhikode on Friday. The Boeing 737 landed in tailwind, skid off the runway and broke in half.
 "We will conduct additional checks at major, busy airports across India that are affected by the monsoon rains," Arun Kumar, head of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in an interview late on Monday.
 "We will review everything - the condition of the runway, its incline, the lighting as well as drainage."
 Kumar said the special audit was over and above the DGCA's routine checks and could cover a dozen airports including those in Chennai, Kochi, Trivandrum as well as Mumbai, all of which get heavy annual rains.
 Air India Express is the low cost arm of state carrier Air India. The flight was repatriating Indians stranded in Dubai due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The black boxes have been recovered and their data is being examined.
 India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the probe into the crash. Boeing and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board are also taking part in the effort, Kumar said.
 "Once the findings are finalised, and if something is amiss we will take action to rectify it," he said.
 The crash was the worst in India in a decade, and the second fatal accident on a "table-top" runway which is typically found in high-altitude areas.
 Table-top runways are built by excavating the peaks of hills and have steep drops at one or both ends, increasing the danger if pilots under- or over- shoot their approach.
 At Calicut airport, where the plane crashed on Friday, the pilot landed a third of the way along the runway, Kumar said on Sunday, leaving less room to bring the plane to a halt.
 Airports with table-top runways are subject to the same rigorous regulatory requirements and are periodically audited for safety, Kumar said.
 In 2010, an Air India Express plane overshot a similar runway in the southern city of Mangalore. It fell down a hillside and burst into flames, killing 158 people.
 A government-led committee looking into that crash had suggested installing an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS) on table-top airports. EMAS is a special surface usually installed at the end of the runway to quickly stop an aircraft.
 However, a second committee suggested that if the runway safety area was increased at Calicut airport, the EMAS would not be needed, Kumar said.
 Subsequently, the runway safety area was increased to 240 metres, more than the 90 metres prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, he said.

 Kurz vor Beginn des neuen Schuljahres am Montag haben Berliner Elternvertretungen Nachbesserungen an den Schutz- und Hygienekonzepten in der Corona-Pandemie gefordert. Ihrer Ansicht nach sollten Schüler und Lehrer in der ersten Schulwoche auch im Unterricht einen Mund-Nasen-Schutz tragen – bisher ist das in Schulgebäuden lediglich auf Fluren, in der Toilette, in Aufenthalts- und Begegnungsräumen vorgesehen.  
 \n
 Der Landeselternausschuss und die zwölf Bezirksausschüsse forderten am Samstag zudem, den Schulen freizustellen, in den ersten ein oder zwei Schulwochen auf einen Plan B umzuschwenken, also mit reduzierter Klassengröße zu unterrichten. Nötig seien zudem mehr Corona-Tests für Schüler und Lehrkräfte. Anlass für die Forderungen seien die Reiserückkehrer und die Sorge vor einer höheren Infektionsgefahr, sagte der Vorsitzende des Landeselternausschusses, Norman Heise. Seine Hoffnung ist, dass die Sonderregeln für die ersten ein oder zwei Wochen vor dem Hintergrund der Inkubationszeit helfen können, eine Verbreitung der Infektion zu vermeiden.
 \n
 Die Elternvertretungen gehen Heise zufolge davon aus, das die meisten Schulen wegen der hohen Temperaturen in den kommenden Tagen ohnehin einen verkürzten Unterricht haben werden.
