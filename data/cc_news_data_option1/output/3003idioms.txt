Bharti Airtel Ltd chief executive Gopal Vittal on Thursday hinted at another round of tariff hike, stressing that the telecom operator's average revenue per user (Arpu) needs to move towards Rs 200 a month, and eventually to Rs 300, for a sustainable business model. Vittal did not give any timeline for the next increase in call and data tariffs. He was addressing an analysts' call, a day after the telco reported a loss of Rs 15,933 crore in the June quarter due to provisions of Rs 11,746 crore made towards statutory dues. Airtel's Arpu in the June quarter was at Rs 157, up from Rs 154 in the March quarter.The company last raised tariffs by up to 42% in December.Airtel's chief financial officer Badal Bagri said the provision made for adjusted gross revenue (AGR)-related dues should be considered "full and final". The company also said its liquidity position is comfortable, implying no challenges in paying the dues. The department of telecommunications (DoT) estimated Airtel's dues at around Rs 43,780 crore, of which the telco has already paid Rs 18,000 to the government. "We have taken an incremental provision…This is full and final because, as per the (Supreme Court) order, this (the dues) cannot be challenged, recalculated or reassessed," Bagri said. The company, however, hopes the dues are to be paid over a few years, said Harjeet Kohli, director in-charge of finance. "Financing-wise, it (fundraising for clearing AGR dues) is not really necessary. We have cash on the books. There are no liquidity access issues and there is no immediate need to add to the payment provisions," Kohli added. The Supreme Court is yet to pronounce its order over staggered payments of AGR dues. CEO Vittal declined to comment on the issue as the order is reserved. Airtel and rival Vodafone Idea Ltd have requested for a 15-year payment window.Vittal pointed out that the fundamental issue with 5G is the cost of spectrum, which "is way over the top for any kind of business model to work. The cost of spectrum needs to come down and the ecosystem needs to evolve", he said. "We have always maintained that the indicative reserve price on the spectrum of 5G--the 3.5 GHz band--are very, very expensive and we will not be able to afford it at those levels. Secondly, the ecosystem for 5G is very nascent," Vittal said. He said the commercial roll-out of 5G is still a few years away, while billionaire Mukesh Ambani recently announced that his company Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has readied indigenous 5G solutions and can start trials as soon as spectrum is made available.

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — State Sen. Iris Martinez, a respected and influential state and national Democratic Party leader, on Thursday joined a burgeoning group of Democratic lawmakers — all women — calling for Michael Madigan to relinquish his decades-long grip on Illinois politics by resigning as party leader, House speaker, or both, since he was implicated in a federal bribery investigation. Two others making similar demands Thursday bring to seven the number of Democratic women in the General Assembly wanting Madigan to surrender his virtual control of the Capitol after federal prosecutors named him in a criminal investigation. In the July 17 deferred prosecution agreement, ComEd acknowledged it used bribes in Springfield to get legislation favorable to the utility giant and that it involved the speaker of the House, without naming the 78-year-old Madigan. “It’s very clear in what you’re reading in the ComEd document,” said Martinez, the DNC's Hispanic Caucus chairwoman and a state party committeewoman for 26 years. “You know nothing happens in Springfield without the speaker signing off. You don’t have to read between the lines to see what is going on.” Madigan, who has been at the House helm for 35 of the past 37 years — the longest tenure of any legislative leader in U.S. history — has not been charged with wrongdoing. He has said he has done nothing wrong and is cooperating in the ongoing investigation. His spokeswoman, Maura Possley, declined comment Thursday. The others joining Martinez, who wants Madigan out as party chairman to prevent a “distraction” at the presidential nominating convention next month, on Thursday were Reps. Stephanie Kifowit of Oswego and Kelly Cassidy of Chicago. Earlier, Sen. Melinda Bush of Grayslake, a leader on sexual-harassment prevention, and...

"In the name of equality, transparency, and accountability, we must face the historic role of our organization in promoting racial injustice as we move forward in our mission to save wildlife and wild places," said the President and CEO of the Society for the Conservation of Wildlife, Cristián Samper, in a statement.
 The exhibition was greeted with swift condemnation from local black community leaders at the time, and Benga was withdrawn. The Rev. James Gordon, who led the protests against the zoo, eventually convinced him to allow him to take Benga to a black youth orphanage that operated in Weeksvile, Brooklyn.
 Benga later moved to Virginia, but without the opportunity to return home due to travel complications during World War I, he committed suicide a decade after the exposure in 1916.
 "We deeply regret that many people and generations have been affected by these actions or by our failure to condemn and publicly denounce them," Samper continued in the statement, which was published along with an apology letter that he sent to staff on June 16.
 Samper, who is Latino, also apologized to WCS founders Madison Grant and Henry Fairfield Osborn, who promoted what Samper called "eugenics-based pseudoscientific racism."
 The CEO said the organization finally decided to address its disturbing past as it prepared for its 125th anniversary this year and as civil unrest over the George Floyd police murder continues to plague the nation.
 Samper in his letter to staff pledged to "publicly acknowledge the mistakes of our past" and digitize his Benga-related records, which were also published online Wednesday.
 He said the organization would hire a "diversity officer" to work alongside its executives and expand training to nurture a diverse and tolerant workforce.
 "Today we challenge ourselves to do better and never look the other way when and where injustice occurs," said Samper.
