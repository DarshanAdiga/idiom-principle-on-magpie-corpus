A second stimulus payment worth a maximum of $1,200 for qualified individuals (and more for dependents) is still under negotiation, but it may not be approved and sent out in 2020.
 The timeline to get new stimulus aid passed remains up in the air. Some Republican proposals don't include any money to be sent directly to the American people, but President-elect Joe Biden (who's set to be inaugurated Jan. 20) has a stimulus plan for the US that does include funding for a second stimulus payment. Meanwhile, the deadline to file a claim to get a catch-up first stimulus payment for nonfilers of federal taxes, citizens who are incarcerated and people with a dependent, is 12 p.m. PT (3 p.m. ET) _today_ , Nov. 21.
 Factors including yearly income, age, child support situation, tax status, citizenship and the ages of the people in your household are expected to once again be considered in determining stimulus payment amounts, though some people might not be eligible for a second payment, even if they got the first one.

STERLING, Va. (AP) — Housing Secretary Ben Carson is crediting unapproved, experimental treatments with saving his life after he became “desperately ill” following his infection with the coronavirus. There is no medical evidence that the treatments Carson cited worked. A retired neurosurgeon, Carson said Friday that he believes he's “out of the woods.\" He disclosed that his wife, Candy, also had COVID-19, the disease the coronavirus causes. Carson tested positive earlier this month. Most people recover from the disease, which has killed more than 250,000 Americans and sickened nearly 12 million, including President Donald Trump and members of his family. In a statement posted on Facebook, Carson said he was “extremely sick” but saw “dramatic improvement” after taking a botanical treatment derived from the oleander plant. Carson said he has underlying conditions, which he did not specify, “and after a brief period when I only experienced minor discomfort, the symptoms accelerated and I became desperately ill.” Carson said Trump was aware of his condition and “cleared me for the monoclonal antibody therapy that he had previously received, which I am convinced saved my life.” The White House declined comment, instead referring questions about possible intervention into Carson's medical care by Trump to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond Saturday to a request for comment. “I do believe I am out of the woods at this point,” said the secretary, who gave credit to Trump, the White House medical team and doctors at the Walter Reed military hospital. Trump spent three days at Walter Reed after his infection in early October, where he received a variety of experimental treatments,...

This afternoon’s lineup of films on Turner Classic Movies is set at school, but with characters who are not there as students, or at least not in a traditional way. First up is 1951’s _Goodbye, My Fancy_ , a romantic comedy starring Joan Crawford as a politician who returns to her former college to receive an honorary degree, only to find that her old flame — a former professor (Robert Young) — is now the university president. Next, Robert Taylor and Vivien Leigh star in the drama _A Yank at Oxford_ (1938), with Taylor playing a cocky American athlete who receives a scholarship to attend England’s staid Oxford University and almost immediately encounters friction. A similar situation befalls Mickey Rooney’s American character in the next film, the more comedic _A Yank at Eton_ (1942). Finally, in the comedy _Mr. Belvedere Goes to College_ (1949), the titular genius portrayed by Clifton Webb enrolls in a university with plans to obtain a four-year degree in only one year.

Anna Breland Bailey      Tallahassee - Anna Breland Bailey, went home to be with her Lord, Monday, November 16, 2020.      Born and raised in Marianna, Florida, the youngest of five, fun, spirited and talented children, she was born to Jabe A. Breland M.D. and Betty B Breland. Her father Jabe, referred to her as the Caboose. Graduating from Marianna High School, class of 79; she was also a member of the Marianna High School band. Anna attended Chipola College, prior to marriage. Her heart was centered in Marianna, and at St. Luke's Episcopal Church where she worshiped, singing in the choir from age 9. It is most fitting that she will be laid to rest there. Her career was in Insurance, where she worked for 37 years, with J. Smith Lanier & Co., a Marsh & McClellan Agency, working as Administrative Manager, Accounting Coordinator, Commercial and Personal Lines.      Known for her curly blonde hair, her big smile, and her humor, her music was indeed, her highest and best gift. She was a choir member and soloist, for many years, both at Advent Episcopal, and St. John's Episcopal Church. Devoted to all things church, as an adult, she participated and then engaged in leadership in the Episcopal Cursillo movement for many years, serving as a Rectora for Cursillo weekend #100 in 2002.      Anna was also known for her kindness, her decency, generosity, and her willingness to help others. Her determination to focus on, and finish a task assigned or taken up, was legendary. She was also defined by her loves. Anna loved her family and was always happy to be in the mix of a Breland family gathering. She loved music; her voice, a gift that blessed others from the choir-loft, and in the congregation. She loved her son Jason deeply, passing on to him her love of music. She loved, with all that she possessed, her precious granddaughter, Melicia. And she loved greatly, her husband Brian. We could never talk about Anna and not about her cats. Anna loved cats, the more the merrier, although her husband took pains to avoid for her, the moniker of "crazy old cat lady."      She was preceded in death by her parents, Jabe A. Breland, MD and Betty Baker Breland of Marianna, as well as her grandparents, Henry H. Baker and Jane Lee Baker, Panama City, and Loren D. Breland and Gladys D. Breland of Hattiesburg.      She is survived by survived by her husband, Brian Bailey, her son, Jason Perdue of Tallahassee, and her granddaughter, Melicia Perdue of Baltimore. She is also survived by her siblings, Jabe A. Breland (Jeanne) of Tallahassee, Tom L. Breland (Nancy) and Margaret Breland Watkins (Gordon) of Marianna, and Dr. Henry Breland (Nancy) of Panama City, as well as many nieces. nephews, cousins, and friends.      Her service will be held at St. Peter's Anglican Cathedral, Tallahassee, on November 30, 2020 at 1pm, with burial at St. Luke's in Marianna following the service.      In lieu of flowers, Anna desired contributions, to either, the music programs of St. Peter's Anglican Cathedral, or St. John's Episcopal Church, Tallahassee, or St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Marianna. For those who desire, contributions can also be made to the Cursillo movement in the Diocese of Florida.      Rocky Bevis and Kelly Barber of Bevis Funeral Home (850-385-2193 or www.bevisfh.com) are assisting the Bailey family with their arrangements.

Lenora Matthews was born Feb. 16, 1921 to James and Dottie Loftin in Witts Springs, Arkansas.
 She went home to be with the Lord and lots of loved ones on Friday, Nov. 6, 2020 in Mesa, Arizona. She is survived by her daughters Alice and Tina; sons Winston, Ronnie, and Robert; her grandchildren Sheilah, Candy, Victor, Valerie, Andrew, Joshua, Layne, Kurt, Gary, Jonathan and Jaime; her brother Herbert; and sisters Janice, Sharon, and Mary; and many great and great-great grandchildren. She was preceded in death by her parents; husband of 77 years, Winston Carlyle; sons Donald Eugene, and Winston Gene; brothers Carl, Clyde, Jerry, and LaDon; sisters Nellie, Zelta, Priscilla, Lillian, and Donnie; and grandchildren Dennis and Nicole.
 Lenora was the oldest of 14 children. She was like the "2nd mom" to many of them. She started cooking when she was 4 years old. This was on a wood stove and she had to stand on an apple box to be able to see over the top of the stove. She had to do laundry by using the washboard/scrub board. She learned a lot of tricks from her mother in how to make food stretch to feed all of them during the Depression.
 She was known for her homemade biscuits. They were so good. It was an extra special treat when she made chocolate gravy to go over the biscuits. She was also known for her potato salad. Her grandson Layne loved it and bragged on it every time he had it. When she knew he was coming to visit she would make it for him. She always had visitors.
 Services were held on Saturday, Nov. 14, 2020 at Blue Ridge Christian Center in Lakeside. She was buried at Lakeside Cemetery alongside her beloved husband.

Martin Keown admits that there can be scraps between teammates in training, but he feels that the one between Arsenal’s David Luiz and Dani Ceballos might have something undertone.
 Reports this week revealed that both players had a falling out in Arsenal training last Friday and it got physical.
 The report claims that Ceballos had tackled Luiz in a manner that he didn’t like and the Brazilian punched the midfielder and drew blood from his nose. They were later separated by teammates and coaches before the situation escalated.
 Although the report was later denied on Twitter by Ceballos who branded the news as “fake”. Keown claims that scraps between teammates were normal, but this particular incident might mean more and speculated that it might be coming from a place of unhappiness in the team as they struggle for form.
 ‘If it did happen it wouldn’t be unusual, up and down the country these things happen,’ Keown told talkSPORT as quoted by Metro Sports.
 ‘It’s never really nice to see it, but it explains perhaps, Arsenal lost that game recently against [Aston] Villa very heavily. Maybe there’s a bit of a problem within the camp and people get a bit fraught with one another.
 ‘It happens, I’m afraid. There’s a fighting spirit there, you wouldn’t want it to happen too often.
 ‘They’re sort of brothers in arms, you don’t want family fighting, but they’re not family, you have to draw that line. But you need to keep everyone together as well, Arteta needs to jump on that.
 ‘It’s always a little bit tetchy behind the scenes in a football club and it overspills sometimes when things are not going quite so well.
 ‘But you want that competition amongst the group because then, when there’s competition for places you get the best performances.’
 Mikel Arteta will hope that his players can be that angry to get the win when football returns this weekend against Leeds United.

“He’s practicing incredibly hard,” Hurley said. “He’s on the gold medal stand for us now. He’s dialed in.”
 A second team All-Big East honoree in the preseason, Bouknight appears capable of even more this season. He admits that he expects big things and is confident he can deliver.
 “My confidence is at an all-time high,” Bouknight said. “I feel like I have different abilities. I feel like I’ve been working on my game all summer, getting faster, stronger, more explosive.”
 As impressed as Rivera was by Bouknight’s exploits in high school, the smooth wing looks like a different player and man these days.
 “There were times throughout the game (in high school) where he would show glimpses of greatness. He’s a talented kid,” Rivera said. “But to see how much he’s A, matured mentally when I speak to him, and B, how much he’s physically matured. UConn has done a terrific job with that; all credit to their strength coach.”
 Bouknight’s mental maturation was forced to occur rather quickly after his arrival on the UConn campus last season.
 He was arrested by police on charges of evading responsibility, interfering with a police office and driving without a license following a minor traffic accident just off the Storrs campus.
 Bouknight applied for and received accelerated rehabilitation, a special form of probation for first-time offenders that would eventually see his record erased, but the event forced him to miss the first three games of the regular season after a suspension imposed by Hurley.
 Bouknight was contrite and apologetic after, though it obviously stunted his growth slightly as a player. In the long run, Rivera believes, it will be a minor hiccup.
 “I’ll challenge any adult to say they went through their academic career or even their professional career never having to be re-directed,” Rivera said.
 “I think this was a clear case of a young person wanting to be a young person and not understanding their status,” Rivera added. “I don’t think the kid was malicious.”
 Bouknight appeared to put the incident behind him quickly, at least when it came to performing on the court. Likewise, his current head coach points out he has a similar ability to forget about bad plays during games.
 “He gets over mistakes quickly,” Hurley said, “and moves on to the next play.”
 Most all of UConn’s plays this season will run through Bouknight. Point guards R.J. Cole or Gaffney will have the ball in their hands plenty, but this is clearly Bouknight’s team now.
 And that should scare opponents, Rivera thinks.
 “I don’t think he’s even scratching the surface of who he’s going to be long- term,” Rivera said. “And he’s got a chance to guide UConn back to its glory days.”
 That puts a lot on Bouknight’s shoulders. A UConn player has not come back to campus as a sophomore with more expected of him since perhaps Caron Butler in 2001 or all the way back to Ray Allen in 1994.
 Hurley, however, isn’t worried about the pressure to perform weighing down the high-flying Bouknight.
 “This is sports. If you’re a head coach or you’re a star player, if you want to do it at this level, there’s pressure,” Hurley said. “And there’s levels. If you want to move on to the next level, you have to perform at a high level.”
 And it’s becoming obvious that Bouknight is ready to level up.

But the Forest Service extended the evaluation process into next year as it responded to suggestions from the bidders and refined the prescriptions for the thinning projects.
 One of the biggest issues remains how to get rid of the 50 tons of biomass on each thinned acre while still making the project profitable for the bidder — at no cost to the government.
 The Arizona Corporation Commission squashed hopes it would create a market for that biomass by requiring Arizona utilities to generate 60 or 90 megawatts of electricity annually from biomass.
 The lack of a market for biomass and the lack of money for the kinds of subsidies that made the earlier White Mountains Stewardship Project viable has stalled thinning projects.
 Kreuger said the conversations with contractors about their initial proposals “allows those offerers to revise their bids based on weaknesses, adverse past performance and technical aspects of each proposal. Our evaluation team is participating in a robust discussion period before the contracting officer requests final contract offers. This evaluation process is certainly taking time, but that’s where we stand right now.”
 Kreuger said the Forest Service remains on track to award contracts in April or May of next year.
 The 4FRI project remains the only currently viable way to reduce tree densities on several million acres of northern Arizona forests from about 1,000 trees per acre to more like 100 trees per acre.
 The pre-settlement forest had fewer than 100 trees per acre and was resistant to frequent, low-intensity ground fires that burned grass, shrubs and small trees without reaching the lower branches of the old growth ponderosa pines.
 After a century of clear-cutting, grazing and fire suppression, wildfires turn into crown fires thanks the tons of accumulated dead wood on every acre and the thickets of saplings.
 The fires climb readily into the lower branches of the big trees and then race from tree-top to tree-top along interlocking limbs.
 This has produced the new era of megafires, like the Wallow and Rodeo Chediski as well as the fire that consumed Paradise, California, killing 85 people.
 Show Low, Pinetop, Payson and Pine all face a higher risk of catastrophic fire than did Paradise, according to one national study.
 But hey, we survived another wildfire year.
 And maybe the Forest Service will actually issue contracts in April.
 At about the same time we get a COVID vaccine.

PUNE The reworked police manual, a three-volume document, which promises to be much more exhaustive than its previous editions, is awaiting a nod from the state government, according to Subodh Jaiswal, director-general of police (DGP), Maharashtra.Maharashtra Police Manual deals with three broad categories of police work. The first volume deals with the administration of police force, the second maps out finance, supplies and office procedure, and the third define powers and duties of the police.The new police manual will have detailed protocols for dealing with victims and survivors of crimes against women. This is something that has not found a place in the official state police manual till date.With the changing nature of crime and community, the changed manual - if the officers involved are to be believed - will potentially bring about a change in the relationship with the police and the people they are sworn to protect.The manual was first published in 1959 under the title Bombay Police Manual.He said that a team led by Maharashtra Police Academy (MPA) director Aswati Dorje and former additional director general (ADG) training Sanjay Saxena was created to undertake the task. "The team wrote to the government which in-turn created a team of deputy secretaries - law, home, general administration department (GAD) - to gauge the potential of the proposal the police officers had made," according to Jaiswal."It was a year-long effort by various teams. The intensive work went on for about six months. We worked through holidays and weekends to make it happen as various documents were needed to be referred to," said Dorje."The manual requires to be based on the laws, rules, procedures, orders, circulars, guidelines from the government, manuals of other organisations and states, all of which required massive referencing and compilation of material. We made smaller teams to work on each of the three volumes and consulted with government functionaries, senior officers handling the particular specialised branches, lawyers and experts in each of the topics," she said.Some of the highlight of changes in the manualINVESTIGATION OF CRIMES AGAINST WOMENThere has been a flood of legislation on the topic of crimes against women which was not a part of the earlier manuals.Further, there has been a shift from why it happened to the particular victim/survivor to what happened to her and this had to be reflected in the manual, along with a more empathetic approach, according to Director Dorje.The law now requires the police to go to the woman's house or a preferred location to interview her, instead of calling her to the police station.While the functional changes will only be known if and when the manual is published, the officer heading the overhaul pointed out that the process will be more sensitive towards victims and survivors.Among major changes will be the method and sensitivity in the collection of evidence and in the application of the law while taking into consideration whether the woman wants to register a complaint or not.CYBER AND ECONOMIC OFFENCESWith the fast- changing nature of the crime, the emphasis has been given on the investigation of cyber and cyber-enabled offences."Emphasis has been given on detailing the procedure for collection of evidence in the different cyber offences," said Director Dorje.Guidelines and important steps to be taken in the investigation of different economic offences have also been introduced.USE OF POLICE FORCEThe Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) manual, as well as circulars and guidelines by the police leadership over the years, were referred to while putting together the chapter on the maintenance of public order. Additionally, an Instruction Manual for the London Metropolitan Police, published in the 1930s, was even referred to for its language describing the different stages of use of force in law and order situations."The goal of the policies set by the machinery then was to control people by hook or by crook. That cannot work anymore. Unit commanders now have to be given clear guidelines and standard operating procedures on dealing with different situations affecting public order," said Dorje.Along with these areas, the manual will make massive changes in recruitment procedures, training, service conditions, budgetary powers, auditing, and documenting.

 Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense.
 He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesn’t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they’re hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing.
 His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for Rittenhouse has raised millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September.

Tonight’s double-feature on Turner Classic Movies features two movies that looked at the future — one with a bit more hopeful outlook on how humanity will progress, the other a dystopian vision of where we are headed. First up in Stanley Kubrick’s iconic sci-fi epic _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968), which, while not entirely accurate in its prediction of where humanity and technology would be in the 21st century, has some close guesses and remains one of the most stunningly realistic depictions of space travel in movie history, thanks to its Oscar-winning visual effects. Tonight’s second film is _THX 1138_ (1971), which was _Star Wars_ creator George Lucas’ feature film directorial debut (based off a student film he made at USC), and is a different type of sci-fi experience than what fans of _Star Wars_ may be expecting from Lucas. It’s a tale set in a dystopian future where the population is controlled by android police and the mandatory use of emotion-suppressing drugs, a world a man (Robert Duvall) given simply the designation THX 1138 instead of a name tries to escape.

L’albero ha una forte vocazione ecologica e con i suoi 366 metri di carta potrebbe risultare come l’albero di natale più alto/lungo al mondo.

Her father Jabe, referred to her as the Caboose. Graduating from Marianna High School, class of 79; she was also a member of the Marianna High School band.

She was also defined by her loves. Anna loved her family and was always happy to be in the mix of a Breland family gathering. She loved music; her voice, a gift that blessed others from the choir-loft, and in the congregation. She loved her son Jason deeply, passing on to him her love of music. She loved, with all that she possessed, her precious granddaughter, Melicia. And she loved greatly, her husband Brian. We could never talk about Anna and not about her cats. Anna loved cats, the more the merrier, although her husband took pains to avoid for her, the moniker of "crazy old cat lady." She was preceded in death by her parents, Jabe A.

Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, once admitted, "The left, as a rule, does not want to hear thoughtful disagreement." Given this mentality, liberals, Democrats and the media find Trump absolutely, positively insufferable. This raises a question. Mr. Biden, which side needs to heal?

The art scene in the City of Light is the focus of two iconic films airing back-to-back tonight. First up is _An American in Paris_ (1951), the classic musical directed by Vincente Minnelli and choreographed by Gene Kelly, who stars alongside Leslie Caron in her film debut. The film was inspired by George Gershwin’s 1928 orchestral work of the same name, and most of its songs also come from George and Ira Gershwin. The brilliantly colorful and fun film won six of the eight Oscars for which it was nominated, including Best Picture and an honorary Oscar to Kelly for his achievements in choreography. Tonight’s second film is _Moulin Rouge_ (1952), director/cowriter John Huston’s look at 19th-century artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (José Ferrer). The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Ferrer, and won two, for its art direction and costume design.

“Drunk driving is a real threat to our community. Already this year, 2 of the 3 fatal crashes in Williams County have been OVI related. That threat increases during holidays like Thanksgiving.,” said Peg Buda, Williams County Safe Communities Coordinator, “Blackout Wednesday, is a dangerous trend. Driving under the influence is deadly and illegal, and no one should ever take that risk.”

Recently, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert and Bummercloud in Chief, Dr. Anthony Fauci, expressed concerns over families gathering together for a traditional Thanksgiving celebration this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Despite playfully assigning nicknames to this fine physician (also, Dr. Doomopotamus), I think we should take these warnings seriously and do all we can to protect our family members from possible viral droplets spewing from our pumpkin pie holes when we gnaw on our Butterballs.
 After much contemplation (heavily under the influence of my three daughters’ leftover Halloween candy), I’ve come up with a few options for making Thanksgiving dinner not only safer, but also fun.
 First, we all know that the U.S. Postal Service has had its struggles recently. Family members can stay safe and do their part to support this national institution by selecting a traditional, fully-cooked Thanksgiving dish to mail to one another – just to see what happens. Have you ever received an envelope full of giblets? What about a cardboard packing tube stuffed with sweet potato casserole? Just tip up and enjoy! And think of the shock your local porch pirates will experience when they rip open a stolen bubble-padded mailer bursting with Grampa’s special deviled eggs.
 If mailing your munchies doesn’t sound appealing, how about a delicious game of catch in the back yard? Socially distanced relatives can put on ponchos and turn menu items into mouthwatering projectiles while burning off a few calories as they try to snag some sustenance in midair. Once Dad says grace over a bullhorn, let the games begin! With unruly kids occupied by shooting stuffing from slingshots, the nerdy uncle with the engineering degree catapulting the creamed corn, and Grandma serving gravy from a squirt gun, the entire family can safely get in on the action.
 And don’t worry about the potential mess. The household pets will be eager to take care of the clean-up. (Just be sure to avoid any of Aunt Betty’s brownie bites you may find in the grass later.)
 Ok, so, yes, I’m being facetious about these suggestions for a socially- distanced Thanksgiving — maybe. I guess I’m just grasping at drumsticks over my fear of having to prepare my own Thanksgiving dinner this year. For our entire lives, my wife, three daughters and I have been hosted by our parents for Thanksgiving dinner. We’ve always happily sung “Over the Highway and Through the Speed Traps to Grandmother’s House We Go” as we anticipated a good, old fashioned feast not prepared in a microwave or ordered on my cell phone. About all I know how to do for a homemade Thanksgiving is to open the store-bought cranberry sauce that retains the shape of the can.

“El Reventonazo de la Chola” no es ajeno a la coyuntura política de nuestro país, por ello, para la nueva edición del programa humorístico, Fernando Armas imitará al presidente Francisco Sagasti. Respecto a su nuevo personaje Francisco “Don Quijote” Barbástegui”, el actor cómico señaló que está hecho con mucho respeto y cariño, sin hacer ninguna burla u ofensa. “El nombre de ‘Francisco Barbástegui’ es en homenaje a su imagen, que tanto se ha destacado en diferentes redes sociales, de donde también cogimos el apelativo de ‘Don Quijote’. Sé que existen muchos seguidores del programa quienes disfrutarán con la caracterización, así como otro grupo de personas a las que no les agrada tanto. Sin embargo, nosotros estamos haciendo esta imitación con mucho respeto y cariño, sin hacer ninguna burla u ofensa”, señaló Armas. Por otro lado, el programa “El Reventonazo de la Chola” presentará una secuencia en tributo a todos los que participaron en las diferentes marchas a nivel nacional. El sketch contará con la participación del artista Terco92 y Shantall Oneto, quienes a través de sus canciones buscan solidarizarse, sobre todo, con los fallecidos, sus familias, y los heridos. “Este homenaje es un agradecimiento a todos esos jóvenes que salieron a marchar por nuestro país. Desde el ‘Reventonazo de la Chola’, queremos solidarizarnos con ellos, con quienes aún están hospitalizados y, sobre todo, con las víctimas y sus familias. Mucha fuerza para todos”, comentó Ernesto Pimentel. “El Reventonazo de la Chola” se transmite todos los sábados después de “La rosa de Guadalupe”, por la señal de América TV.
