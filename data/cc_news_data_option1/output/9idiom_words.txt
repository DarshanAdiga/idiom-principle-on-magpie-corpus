"May the New Year bring peace and prosperity to the people of Bihar who give their blessings to NDA just like they had done in the parliamentary elections last year", Modi said when asked by journalists what message he would like to give on the day.

After receiving guests at his residence, Modi paid a visit to the Chief Minister who lives next door and the two exchanged New Year greetings with a warm hug. Kumar also told the Deputy CM that he was pleasantly surprised to see the latter on the day as he had expected Modi to be away in Chennai for a while.

On Monday, Modi launched a veiled attack on Kishor without mentioning him by name making snide remarks on Twitter about his businesses as a professional electoral strategist and accusing him of violating coalition dharma and benefiting the opposition.

Kishor's attack on Modi left the BJP fuming and the party's leaders cutting across factions inveighed against the JD(U) national vice president even as the chief minister's party sought to avoid getting drawn into the controversy.

Kumar evaded queries about the raging controversy on Tuesday and muttered "sab theek hai" (all is well) while hurrying past the posse of journalists.

Kishor hit back on Tuesday as he wrote on Twitter, mentioning the Deputy CM by name, that he was bemused to hear about coalition dharma from the BJP leader who owed his position to "circumstances", alluding to the saffron party having lost the assembly elections of 2015 but achieving power two years later on account of a volte face by Nitish Kumar.

On Monday, Kishor had also drawn flak from JD(U) heavyweight RCP Singh who had questioned the "untimely" utterances on seat-sharing.

Flanked by a large number of cabinet and party colleagues, supporters and officials, Modi who returned from a day-long vacation at Chennai where one of his son lives celebrated the New Year by cutting a sumptuous cake with an icing that read "2020". Polls are due in Bihar later this year.

He also hoped that 'katuta' (bitterness), 'dwesh' (ill-will) and 'avishwas' (mistrust)" in the NDA camp would fade away.

If a candidate has a genuine reason behind the shortage of attendance, they will have to submit the supporting documents with the authorities by January 7. As per the circular, no case will be considered post the deadline and all the standard operating procedures for calculation of attendance will have to be followed.

Notably, political temperature in the state had soared in the last few days after Kishor, during interviews, contended that the JD(U) must contest on more number of seats in assembly polls than the BJP.

The CBSE board exams will commence from February 15 and admit cards will be released only for students who are eligible by all means including that of mandatory attendance. The list of candidates with short attendance will reach regional offices and the final decision will be taken on or before January 7.

Students whose attendance will be calculated less than 75 per cent will not be allowed to appear for the exams, as per the rule mandated by the CBSE.

The senior BJP leader, who was receiving guests at his residence on the occasion of New Year, also hoped that the people of the state will vote for the NDA in Assembly polls with the same enthusiasm as was evident in the Lok Sabha polls wherein the coalition won 39 out of 40 seats.
