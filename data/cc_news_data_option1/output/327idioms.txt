His most important performance, though, came Jan. 18 when Shady hosted No. 4 Bluefield.
 Limited to just two points in the first half, Williams exploded in the second half for 18 points, but his most important contribution came on the defensive side of the ball.
 When Shady head coach Ronnie Olson went to his five guard lineup, Williams was tasked with bumping inside to defend 6-foot-5 center and WVU football commit Sean Martin. The 6-3 guard’s length helped to deny Martin the ball in crunch time forcing the Beavers to settle for outside shots.
 The other candidates in the running will likely include Logan’s David Early, who has drawn Division l offers, University guard and Bowling Green commit Kaden Metheny, Chapmanville center and Marshall commit Obinna Anochili-Killen, Poca’s Isaac McKneely and Morgantown’s Carson Poffenberger.

Technical chart claims that Scorpio Bulkers Inc. (SALT) would settle between $5.01/share to $5.12/share level. However, if the stock price goes below the $4.78 mark, then the market for Scorpio Bulkers Inc. becomes much weaker. If that happens, the stock price might even plunge as low as $4.67 for its downside target. The stock is currently in the red zone of MACD, with the indicator reading -0.46. Traders are always alerted for the move of a stock above or below the zero line due to the fact that the reading is an indicator of the position of the short-term average relative to the long-term average. If the MACD is above the zero line, then the short-term average relative is above that of the long-term average, thus implying an upward momentum. Vice versa is the case if the MACD is below the zero line.

It's possible that Apple could move over its entire lineup to ARM chips, or launch a separate "MacBook" to sit alongside the Air, but I'd prefer the company to start out small in a segment that makes sense. College students and people who browse the web don't need access to high-end Mac software -- and a collection of Catalyst apps from the Mac App Store just might do the trick. Not to mention that replicating the power of Intel's eight-core Core i9 processor might be a little tough on the first go.

The proposed Chandrayaan-2A mission could provide surface data three years earlier, using current infrastructure and with very small incremental effort. And by testing a new ascent system, Chandrayaan-2A could provide ISRO with the capability to conduct sample-return missions from the moon and other planetary destinations. It is especially important for ISRO to soft land on the moon in a mission like this in light of the new international "moon rush."

PARIS (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 30 points and 12 rebounds and the NBA-leading Milwaukee Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 116-103 in the first NBA regular-season game in France. Milwaukee improved to 40-6 with its eighth straight victory. The Bucks have the best 46-game start in franchise history. They were 39-7 in 1970-71 when they went on to win the NBA championship. Eric Bledsoe added 20 points and five assists for the Bucks. Malik Monk led Charlotte with 31 points. The Hornets have lost eight in a row.UNDATED (AP) — Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls probably played a role in changing basketball in Europe, when they played in Paris and won a tournament 23 years ago. Back in Paris on Friday, Jordan lauded Europeans for now changing the game in the U.S. Jordan is the owner of the Charlotte Hornets and he was peppered with questions Friday before his team took on the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA’s first regular season game ever held in Paris. Jordan opined on everything from LeBron James' place in history to Zion Williamson's potential.GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Alysa Liu needed all of her technical brilliance in her impressive jumping arsenal to hold off Mariah Bell and successfully defend her U.S. Figure Skating Championships title. No American woman comes close to the repertoire of jumps the 14-year-old Liu possesses. She hit two triple axels among eight triples overall and attempted the only quad of the event, a lutz she under-rotated. Her 160.12 points by far exceeded the rest of the field and lifted her to 235.52 and up from second place after the short program.DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.

His two entries feature six drivers, four of whom are Indianapolis 500 winners.DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.

The Daily Express called this late-2019 clash a “horror show.” This BBC interview, with surging fears of public anti-Semitism, lingered in headlines as Brits went to the polls. Corbyn’s party suffered its worst defeat in nearly a century.
 Meanwhile, in America, a wave of anti-Semitic attacks left Jews wondering if it was safe to wear yarmulkes and symbols of their faith while walking the sidewalks of New York City. In suburban Monsey, New York, a machete-waving attacker stabbed five people at a Hasidic rabbi’s Hanukkah party. Finally, thousands of New Yorkers marched to show solidarity with the Jewish community.
 The NYPD estimates that anti-Semitic crimes rose 26% last year. Anti-Semitic hate crimes in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are expected to hit an 18-year high, according to research at California State University, San Bernardino.
 No one who watches the news can doubt that “the darkness has returned. It has returned likewise to virtually every country in Europe,” argued Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, who led the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth from 1991 to 2013. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2005 and entered the House of Lords.
 “That this should have happened within living memory of the Holocaust, after the most systematic attempt ever made ... to find a cure for the virus of the world’s longest hate — more than half a century of Holocaust education and anti-racist legislation — is almost unbelievable. It is particularly traumatic that this has happened in the United States, the country where Jews felt more at home than anywhere else in the Diaspora.”

 Watson, keeper of the true country music flame, latest album Call Me Insane, was recorded in Austin with veteran producer Lloyd Maines (Robert Earl Keen, Jerry Jeff Walker, etc.).
 The Austin-based honky-tonker carries on in the tradition of Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson with his “Ameripolitan” brand of American roots music.
 Album highlights include “Jonesin’ For Jones,” a love song to the music of the legendary George Jones, “A Day At A Time,” about “getting by by barely getting by;” “Call Me Insane,” the album’s moody title track; “Bug Ya For Love,” a fun warning to all the single ladies, and “Mamas Don’t Let Your Cowboys Grow Up To Be Babies.” (Yes, it is an answer song to the Waylon Jennings/Willie Nelson hit.) “Crocodile Tears” is a tear-in-your-beer country song that sounds like an instant classic and “Burden Of The Cross” reveals Watson’s serious side.

All Echo models are outfitted with Dolby speaker technology. The Echo, specifically, boasts a 2.5-inch woofer for a full bass sound and a 0.6-inch tweeter for clear treble. It now supports multiroom audio, meaning you can play a certain track in the kitchen while your family listens to something completely different in the living room. This is not an audiophile-grade speaker though. If you want next-level sound, you can hook up the Echo to a third-party audio system via the 3.5mm audio jack.

It's highly unlikely that the coronavirus will ever hit this area but the Lanark, Leeds and Grenville Public Health Unit is prepared if it does, says Dr. Paula Stewart, medical officer of health.
 After the 2003 SARS outbreak, Ontario's public health agencies totally updated their policies and procedures and they are far better able to respond to an outbreak, she told the public health board this week.
 Local hospitals have their protocols in place and they are ready with their infection-control practices that were developed after SARS.
 Stewart said the public health response is being co-ordinated out of the Ministry of Health, which has been quick off the mark.
 In 2002 and 2003, the SARS outbreak, which originated in southern China, killed 774 people worldwide, including 47 in the Toronto area.
 China's attitude to the coronavirus outbreak is entirely different from what it was with SARS, Stewart said.
 China has been open about the current outbreak, revealing where it started, the area affected and how many people have contracted the virus, she added.
 At least 26 people have died in China and the city at the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan, is under quarantine as health officials scramble to understand the mysterious disease and keep it from spreading, Postmedia Network reports. China has quarantined the city and locked down other cities in central Hubei province, affecting more than 30 million people. It is building a special 1,000-bed hospital to treat patients.
 Stewart said Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott this week ordered hospitals and health-care providers immediately to report suspected cases of the virus.
 So far, there have been no confirmed cases in Canada, although a handful of people in B.C. and Quebec are being monitored.
 Stewart said the coronavirus is a respiratory virus that has symptoms ranging from a mild cold to pneumonia, which can be fatal.
 You have to be in contact with an infected person to get the virus, Stewart said.
 "The chance of us having it here in Lanark, Leeds and Grenville is really remote," she added.

PRESCOTT - A proposal that the town pay a third of the cost of a co-ordinator for two business advocacy groups was met with a tepid response at town council this week.
 Dana Valentine, Prescott's economic development officer, said the Prescott Business Improvement Area and the South Grenville Chamber of Commerce have agreed to pool resources to hire a joint co-ordinator and rent office space downtown, but they don't have enough money to do it on their own.
 They proposed that the town kick in a third of the cost - about $13,333 for 10 months - to subsidize the co-ordinator and office for a pilot project.
 In a report to council, Valentine described it as an "exciting partnership."
 "This partnership is expected to generate significant benefits for project partners and the community as a whole," Valentine told council. "It will greatly enhance the individual capacity of each organization, and their joint capacity to explore new initiatives that could not previously be considered due to resource constraints."
 Valentine said both groups are struggling and that a full-time co-ordinator is crucial to their viability, particularity in the case of the BIA.
 "Without that, I would really question the viability of these organizations," Valentine said.
 At least half of council was cool to the idea, however. But rather than have the proposal defeated, council members narrowly voted to defer the issue until their next meeting on Monday.
 Coun. Ray Young said the joint co-ordinator idea had been tried at least twice in the past but lasted only a year because the two groups couldn't get along. They quarreled over the division of the co-ordinator's time and it "tore the job apart," Young said.
 Coun. Leanne Burton, too, was wary about having the town subsidize the co- ordinator. Perhaps the chamber and BIA should merge and pool their resources to hire their own staffer, she suggested.
 Coun. Lee McConnell said he was in business for 20 years in Prescott and Brockville and "it would have been nice if the government stepped in to help" but it didn't.
 Small businesses are used to doing it themselves without government aid, McConnell said.
 The councillor also wondered why the South Grenville Chamber of Commerce wasn't approaching Augusta and Edwardsburgh/Cardinal for money since it represents business in those townships, too.
 Valentine said Prescott is the natural business hub for South Grenville and the office would be located in town so the chamber didn't approach the other municipalities.
 Mayor Brett Todd said the co-ordinator is "desperately needed" for the BIA.
 "If we don't support this, I don't know how the BIA at $28,000 or $29,000 a year will have the capacity to do much of anything," Todd said. "If we don't support this, I really worry about the future of the BIA."
 The money for the co-ordinator's job would buy time for the town, BIA and the chamber to look at their options for the future, he said.
 Coun. Gauri Shankar said he hesitates to give money to the BIA because it represents only businesses in the downtown. He suggested an expansion of the BIA to cover all businesses in Prescott, including the fast-food outlets, O'Reilly's Your Independent Grocer, Canadian Tire, Giant Tiger and others in the north end.
 McConnell said the purpose of the BIA used to be to woo shoppers to the downtown area back at a time when there were multiple stores to attract people to go from store-to-store.
 But downtown has changed - there no longer are five women's wear stores - and so the nature of shopping has changed, too, he said.
 There are more "destination" stores downtown where customers go in, buy and leave, he added.
 So the mission of the BIA should change, too, McConnell suggested.
 No one from the BIA or chamber attended the council meeting. Council decided to look at the proposal again next week, and invite the representatives to show up.
