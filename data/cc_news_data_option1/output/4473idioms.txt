Elliott said he didn’t think his car was as good at the end of the race as it was in the beginning. In the closing laps, though, he was out front while other playoff drivers behind him battled for every spot they could to try to reach the championship.
 He said Sunday’s win was “hands down” the biggest of his career.
 “I’ll remember this forever,” he said.
 The attention now turns to the championship race at Phoenix Raceway for the Hendrick Motorsports (HMS) team.

In the months leading up to Election Day, election officials had to deal with a pandemic that has infected more than 9 million Americans and killed more than 230,000, forcing them to make systemic changes largely on the fly and mostly without federal money. Meanwhile, Trump repeatedly sought to undermine the election with unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.

I am Wallace! I go by Wally though because Wallace sounds so sophisticated. I am 2 years old and potty trained! That’s a plus right? I really enjoy nice long walks outside and I like the kiddos (I have a 6- and 15-year-old at home ... Yes, they’re mine and I love them). I like to be around my people, that’s not to say I’m bad when they leave, I just get kind of anxious when that happens. I’m working on it though every day because I’m such a good boy. Not to wag my own tail but I’m a STAR prison training program graduate, and I follow commands and even though it takes some will power, I won’t even eat until you tell me to! I get along with other dogs and might even steal that warm spot on the bed when one of my people gets up in the morning (don’t judge me)! I’m ready for my forever home! Wallace is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Hi! My name is Zero Suit Samus (or Samus for short), and I'm an energetic pitbull mix who needs some love. And I really mean that. I need a family who will cuddle with me because your penalty for not giving me cuddles is to hear the cry of my people. My foster dad says that based on my crying, I must have descended from pterodactyls, but that's silly because pterodactyls don't even like peanut butter. And I looove peanut butter. And treats. And strawberries. And watermelon. And anything, really. Honestly kid, if you give me your salad, I'll eat it. Don't want your broccoli? I'll take care of your problem. See that toy? It's in my stomach now. See that puke? Well, you can have your toy back.
 Like all superdogs, I have an origin story: I ran across the highway and caused a 4-car pileup that I ended up underneath. It wasn’t my best choice, but it’s still a better love story than "Twilight." I have to take daily medication now, or else I have pretty severe seizures. But I like to think of my epilepsy as my unbridled superpower that the world just isn’t ready for yet.
 I'm a Tulsa native, but I'm still not a fan of the Bermuda grass around here - I get allergies in the summer, so that's something you should know. Despite this, I still love running and rolling in the grass, and if you toss me a ball, I can jump and catch it in mid-air even when it's 6-feet high. I'm not exaggerating. (Pterodactyl dogs never exaggerate.) And would you mind spraying me with a hose once in a while? I love playing in water, especially when it's coming out of a tiny hose at jet-like speeds.
 But if you have another dog in the home, then forget about it because I'm a single-dog dog. A lone wolf. A rebel. I will not share my toys, I will not share my food, and I will not share my family. I do just fine around other dogs in general, but once you introduce toys or food, then I get very territorial. Can we agree that I'll be your only one?
 By the way, I love kids. I don't have these problems with other humans, so don't worry about bringing me home to your young ones. I am loyal to the bone. Don't believe me? Try going for a jog with me. I will keep pace with you the entire time, just running by your hip. Need me to lick the sweat off your face after an especially hot run? Baby, that's what I'm about. I'm a good dog. My foster family says so, too. I will take care of you if you let me. I'm eager to learn, I don't catch coronaviruses, and I'm housebroken. I won't poop in your Cheerios. Unless that's one of your commands, but why would it be? Don't want your Cheerios? Just let me have them instead.

Rocco loves to play with everyone. He is a lover and a cuddler and has a great personality. He has high energy, loves to go on walks and is a great companion on walks. He is smart, loves his treats, frisbees, rope, balls and he will bring his favorite - a tug-o-war with rope. Rocco is 2 years old and is very low-maintenance, doesn't need/want constant attention but does love to sleep with you any chance he gets to sneak in bed. He LOVES the water and using his sniffer to find ANYTHING while out walking, hiking, shopping etc. Rocco actually prefers men first over women and he's not much of a "in your face" right out of the gate kind of dog. He is still very leery about kids, but you can't blame him as he was abused by one previously, but does ok if they just leave him alone. Older kids would be best, but it does take him awhile to warm up to them. NO CATS because if it moves quick he goes after it. He gets along great with other dogs and he is very audible when he plays so that can take some getting used to. Rocco comes with his fair share of emotional history (don't we all?), but he is going to be the perfect fit for that perfect someone and one of his many perks is he'll make sure you're NEVER lonely in the bathroom. Rocco is a STAR Prison Training Program graduate and is fully vaccinated, neutered, microchipped and is available for adoption through Compassionate Animal Rescue Efforts.

Bloomberg) -- Diamondback Energy Inc. hasn’t participated in the latest wave of shale mergers and acquisitions, and its chief executive officer told investors the company will be just fine on its own.
 “Diamondback is not getting left behind if we don’t do anything today,” CEO Travis Stice said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call Tuesday, adding that the company doesn’t need to boost scale to reduce its costs. “We prefer not to make rash decisions at the bottom of the cycle.”
 Scale, cost cuts and survival have been major aspects of recent shale deals as drillers continue to face volatile commodity prices, along with battling an ongoing lack of investor interest.
 Stice isn’t necessarily buying the rationale on some of the recent deals. “Touting an arbitrary number such as a level of production or market cap deemed to be relevant in our space is both specious and self-serving.”
 “This commentary is only coming from companies with those arbitrary characteristics and is not based in fact or proven through operational metrics,” he said.
 Pioneer Natural Resources Co. recently agreed to buy Parsley Energy Inc. for $4.5 billion in stock, creating one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin. ConocoPhillips also announced a $9.7 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., among other deals that have taken place.
 “Patience will be rewarded at the end of the day,” Stice said, adding that “getting bigger does not always translate to getting better.”
 Shares of the Midland, Texas-based driller have lost about 69% this year versus the S&P 500 Energy Index, which has dropped about 51% during the same period.
 Diamondback boasts 31 buy recommendations, though Barclays recently downgraded its rating to a hold-equivalent, as the bank thinks it could underperform its peers following recent M&A deals.
