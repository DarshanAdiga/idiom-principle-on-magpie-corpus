"Is it better to meet people in an area where there's a bigger car park, where it's more convenient, at a time that is better for them, rather than asking them to try and park somewhere close to a test centre that might not have a car park."

WALLACE, RONALD WALTON FRANCIS March 21, 1944 – November 22, 2020 Ron Wallace, a prominent former Aurora politician and newspaper publisher, died November 22, 2020. He was 76. His wife Patricia was by his side. Ron is survived by his daughter, Professor Aurora Wallace (Paris, France) of whom he was extremely proud; and his sister, Brenda (Bunny) Rennette and her family (St. Catharines, Ontario). Fondly remembered by his first wife, Lois (Armstrong) Wallace. Ron was predeceased by his life-partner, Rosemary Schumaker; his parents, Alvin and Ann Wallace; and his brother-in-law, Gwendon Rennette. Ron was born and raised in North Bay, Ontario. He studied journalism at Ryerson in Toronto and was the editor of the Daily Ryersonian. A life-long lover of newspapers, Ron's first newspaper job was as a copy boy at the Toronto Star, where he was responsible for taking news from the teletype machine. He believed that this job made him the first person in Canada to hear that JFK had been shot. Ron was Editor at several newspapers including the Aurora Banner, The Richmond Hill Liberal, and the Etobicoke Guardian before founding his own paper, The Auroran, in 2000. Following in his father's boots, he joined the Aurora Fire Department as a volunteer in 1981, since he was already accustomed to going to fires to cover them for the paper. After the town bookstore burned down, he and Rosemary opened the R&R Book Bar in 1985, a beloved spot in town to discuss politics with Ron over a terrible cup of coffee. Known as "Mr. Aurora", Ron made the town of Aurora his life's work. "If it matters to Aurora, it matters to me" was his motto. Ron was a three-term Councillor for the Town of Aurora; a Trustee for the York Region Board of Education and a board member of the Aurora Historical Society, the Aurora Cemetery Board, and the Chamber of Commerce. His legacy will endure through the Aurora Street Festival, Operation Puck-shy, his work as a Rotarian, supporter of the Royal Canadian Legion Branch 385 and as a generous champion of countless local events and organizations. His many contributions to Aurora have been recognized by the Rotary Club's Paul Harris Fellow Award, the Citizen of the Year Award (2013), and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012). An avid and fearless skier and hockey player, a voracious reader and prolific writer, Ron also enjoyed travelling, collecting, and holding court wherever he was. His storytelling will be greatly missed. It was Ron's wish that expressions of sympathy be made to the Aurora Rotary Club or the Aurora Historical Society. There will be a private graveside service followed by a Celebration of Life at a later date. Ron was an old-school newspaperman. At the end of their copy journalists would type "-30-" to signal the end of the story. Ron Wallace, a beloved husband, father, brother and citizen of Aurora. Fond memories and expressions of sympathy may be shared at www.ThompsonFH-Aurora.com for the Wallace family. -30-

MASSEY, RONALD C. Passed away peacefully at home in Toronto on November 19, 2020 in his 88th year, after a multi-year tussle with cancer. Ronald is survived by his devoted wife of 60 years, Peggy; by his daughter Lynne, son David, daughter-in-law Marilyn and grandchildren Nicole and Connor; and by a wealth of nieces, nephews, cousins and their families. He was predeceased by his parents, Esther (McCann) and Thomas E. Massey; and by older siblings Esther (Lown), Irene (Robb), Ruth (Slater) and Tom Massey. Ron was born in Toronto and lived most of his life there. He began working at the head office of Imperial Oil in 1951 and literally worked his way up from the mailroom, eventually becoming head of risk and insurance. Along the way, he acquired a cottage, a wife, a home, two children, and a bachelor's degree in commerce - in that order. In 1983, he and Peggy moved to Bermuda, where Ron took up roles as Executive Vice President with Ancon Insurance (part of the Exxon organization) and later with Oil Insurance Limited. These roles brought interesting professional challenges plus stimulating opportunities to travel to Europe, Iceland, China, Thailand, and other destinations. Bermuda itself was the source of many new friendships, along with new interests like golf and yacht club lunches. Before, during and after the Bermuda years, a pillar of Ron's life was time spent at Stoney Lake, Ontario. It was there that he and Peggy met in the late 1950s, and once engaged they began planning their own cottage on the lake. Over the decades they spent many happy summers, weekends and holidays at Stoney with family and friends. In retirement, they were fortunate to divide their time between Stoney and Bermuda. Ron considered himself a lucky man. He was grateful to Imperial Oil and the Exxon organization for the solid foundation and many opportunities they provided; he felt that marrying Peggy was the best decision he'd ever made; and he enjoyed warm family connections and decades-long friendships with people from all phases of his life. A celebration of life will be arranged at a later date. In the meantime, friends may wish to remember Ron by hoisting a very dry gin martini or a Scotch on the rocks. For those who are interested, donations to the Sunnybrook Foundation would help support the multiple teams and departments that provided outpatient care during Ron's last few years. Finally, the family extends sincere thanks to the nurses and PSWs of SE Health and to the entire caring, competent team at Eldercare Home Health, with whose assistance Ron was able to live out his days at home with Peggy at his side.
