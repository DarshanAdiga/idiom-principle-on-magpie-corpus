Erken: From the structural investment view, India is still one of the EMs with the largest upward investment potential. In the past, we have argued India is one of the candidates that might benefit from economic activity exiting China, something we have not seen in the 2019 data by the way. But we expect India will benefit to a larger degree in the future. Having said that, we expect that all EMs may struggle in the short term on the back of rising geopolitical developments and this will likely cause a shift towards risk-off sentiment and capital outflows from EMs. Against the backdrop of increasing risk and the dollar strengthening, India may be one of the most vulnerable EMs at the moment.

Xbox fans may still get streaming games after all with Microsoft's future update. Currently, Microsoft is testing a new functionality within the Xbox app that will allow users to play games on their iPads and iPhones without needing to install it. The feature is available only to TestFlight users but is expected to be included in the future version. The Xbox app is different from its xCloud service as it allows streaming from the Xbox console to the iOS device. Following Apple's App Store policy and guidelines those who are interested will have to wait longer. The streaming feature works even when the user is outside his or her home. After testing is done this could be included in the next app update. The service is similar to Sony's PS4 Remote Play app, also available on the iOS. Microsoft's xCloud project launched September 15 and was rebranded as 'Game Pass Ultimate'. It's now available on Android but not on iOS.

His attacking bluntness justify some suggestions of a new right-back signing, but there is still a way of reigniting his level of performance without having to spend a penny.
 Last season Solskjaer managed to reinvigorate Luke Shaw by promoting Brandon Williams to the first-team squad as direct competition, and the academy full- back could again hold the key by giving Wan-Bissaka the challenge he needs on the right.
 Williams broke through at youth level as an attacking right-back, and it is that role he might be best suited should Alex Telles join before transfer deadline day.
 Diogo Dalot is both injury prone and out of favour under Solskjaer which means a back-up option on the right is needed, with both Williams and Ethan Laird viable alternatives who deserve to be considered.

This should be self-evident even to those who are not Indian. With influence over the world order this century expected to tilt from west to east, it is not just a travesty of the United Nations’ (UN) ideals to deny India an equal voice at its highest level, it could actually worsen the odds of global peace. That the world’s largest democracy, home to every sixth individual alive, must have a vote no less than any other country has been obvious all along. The realities of this era, however, dictate that an institution built on the rubble of World War II must either reform itself to face the future, or risk turning into a relic of the past. A permanent seat at the UN Security Council would not be a favour to India, but to all. Addressing the UN’s general assembly on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked how long we must wait for one. The global body may or may not have been reduced to a “talk shop”, as its critics call it, but reform could raise its prospects of relevance as China begins to exert its clout beyond its borders.

Cup upsets in women’s football are rare and getting rarer. Occasionally, at best, a mid-table Women’s Super League side may get the better of one of the division’s top sides, as Everton demonstrated on Sunday, but teams below the fully professional top flight just don’t stand a chance. For Leicester, the odds were marginally better than usual. Over the summer, freshly under the wing of King Power, the Championship team went fully professional themselves and recruited 13 new players. Inadvertently thwarting their ambitions of turning over Manchester City, though, was the rule that only six new recruits could be registered for the rescheduled tournament’s close.

Last week’s ruling by an arbitration tribunal in The Hague in favour of telecom giant Vodafone, in its long-standing tax dispute with the government, presents an opportunity for policymakers to send out a clear signal of departure from the regressive tax policies of the past. The case related to Vodafone’s $11-billion acquisition in 2007 of Hutchison Essar’s assets in India routed through a Cayman Islands-based entity, which, to tax authorities, seemed structured as a tax avoidance transaction. The then government slapped a $2.2-billion tax notice on Vodafone, the buyer, for not deducting tax, but the company’s challenge was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in January 2012. Not one to be cowed down, the then Finance Minister, the late Pranab Mukherjee, amended Section 9 of the Income Tax Act to make transactions of the kind put through by Hutchison and Vodafone liable to tax in India. He then proceeded to give the amendment a retrospective effect through a clause inserted in the Finance Bill, 2012, to make Vodafone liable to pay tax on the deal. Unable to reason with the government, Vodafone Group’s Dutch affiliate sought arbitration proceedings in The Hague in 2014, claiming that the tax demand violated the provision for “fair and equitable treatment” under the India-Netherlands Bilateral Investment Treaty. The tribunal has now ruled in Vodafone’s favour.
 The government would be well advised to bury the issue here and not go in appeal against the arbitration award. The retrospective tax demand was bad in spirit, something that was acknowledged in the past by the NDA government’s own Finance Minister, the late Arun Jaitley. Sure, there are similar pending disputes with others such as Cairn/Vedanta but the merits in those cases will be determined by the provisions of the underlying Bilateral Investment Treaties. Prudence, therefore, lies in walking away from an appeal in the Vodafone case. Not just this. The government should go the whole hog and scrap the retrospective powers under Section 9 through an amendment to the Income Tax Act as that alone will send a clear signal to foreign investors about the country’s commitment to fairness and certainty in tax laws. Certainty is an important canon of taxation and the government cannot be seen as whimsically changing the law with retrospective effect to suit its own interests. Investors, after all, put in their money based on consistency of policy and a retrospective amendment is a red signal to them.
 For the future, there is adequate protection in Section 9 of the Act, as amended in 2012 — and in international efforts to shut out tax avoidance strategies — to ensure that similarly structured deals will not fly. The Modi government could be worried about the optics of these moves — for fear of being branded, yet again, as a “ _suit-boot ki sarkar_ ” that is partial to business interests. But such political considerations must not come in the way of undoing the mess that the UPA government bequeathed it, and doing what, in the final analysis, is the right thing.

El presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, animado por el nombramiento de una jueza conservadora para la Corte Suprema, y su rival demócrata, Joe Biden, se preparan para su primer debate el martes que marcará el tono del final de la carrera hacia la Casa Blanca. Biden llega con una ligera ventaja en los sondeos, pero con una conocida propensión a los errores y una falta de agilidad de palabra que lo hizo reconocer el sábado que el encuentro será difícil. En el centro del debate está la gestión de la crisis del COVID-19, que ha dejado más de 203,782 muertos en Estados Unidos, y que ha disparado el desempleo, golpeando con especial fuerza a las minorías como los afroestadounidenses y los latinos. El político demócrata, de 77 años, que debido a la pandemia lleva a cabo una campaña de baja intensidad, con contados eventos y poca exposición, va a estar bajo una presión a la que no se ha enfrentado desde las primarias de su partido, que acabaron en abril. Este primer duelo de 90 minutos será moderado por el periodista Chris Wallace de la cadena conservadora Fox News y es el primero de tres encuentros antes de las elecciones del 3 de noviembre. Trump no cesa de fustigar a su rival, burlándose de él con el sobrenombre “Joe el dormido” y afirmando que sufre algún tipo de deterioro cognitivo por la edad. Además sostiene que Biden, un político de larga trayectoria anclado en ala moderada del Partido Demócrata, es una “marioneta” de la izquierda radical. “Es como Goebbels”, respondió este sábado Biden, comparando al presidente con el encargado de la propaganda nazi Joseph Goebbels. “Uno dice una mentira una y otra vez, la repite, repite y repite para que se convierta en un hecho incontestable”. “La gente sabe que el presidente es un mentiroso”, añadió Biden. Trump, por su parte, llega al duelo alentado tras haber nominado a una magistrada conservadora para llenar la vacante que el fallecimiento de la jueza progresista Ruth Bader Ginsgurg dejó en la Corte Suprema. Con esta elección espera movilizar el voto de la derecha religiosa que lo ayudó a llegar a la Casa Blanca hace cuatro años, para recuperar terreno en las encuestas, donde está rezagado. “Será fantástica”, dijo Trump a la jueza Amy Coney Barrett, de 48 años, cuando la nominó el sábado en la Casa Blanca. La magistrada, una católica practicante y madre de siete hijos, es conocida por su oposición al aborto, uno de los temas claves en la polarización cultural que domina la actualidad estadounidense. El presidente anticipó una confirmación rápida del nombramiento de Barrett en el Senado, dominado por los republicanos. Su decisión de llenar la vacante en la Corte Suprema generó indignación entre los demócratas, que sin posibilidad de detenerla intentan utilizarla para movilizar a su electorado. Las audiencias para la nominación comenzarán el 12 de octubre y van a ser determinantes durante la campaña hasta el nombramiento, que los republicanos esperan concluir a pocos días de las elecciones. Pese a que Biden cuenta con una ventaja en las encuestas a nivel nacional, con el 49.6% frente al 42,9% de Trump, según el compilado de encuestas RealClearPolitics, la batalla en estados claves será reñida. En estas elecciones hay un número récord de latinos habilitados para votar, con 32 millones de electores hispanos, que representan un 13.3% del total. Entre los latinos la ventaja de Biden es clara con un 65% de apoyo frente al 36% del mandatario republicano, pero esta categoría está lejos de ser un bloque uniforme y en estados claves como Florida, los votantes de origen cubano, venezolano o puertorriqueño responden a diferentes motivaciones. En este bastión, que es clave para llegar a la Casa Blanca con 29 votos electorales, Biden tiene una leve ventaja con el 48.7% de la intención de voto frente al 47.4% de Trump, según RealClearPolitics. Sin embargo, entre los latinos es Trump quien lleva ventaja con 50% frente al 46% de Biden, debido al fuerte apoyo de los cubanos, reveló una encuesta de la cadena NBC News.
