"I think that United need to make changes in the transfer window. Harry Maguire should not be on the left on the central defence. He should be on the right where he is more comfortable," Parker told Eurosport.
 "I’d drop Victor Lindelof and bring in Nathan Ake from Bournemouth. Chelsea don’t seem to want him, so now is the time to make a move. He has proven that he is a good defender in a poor team. He’s comfortable on the ball.
 "Being left-footed, he would bring the ball forward better than Maguire does from that side, which is needed because Luke Shaw isn’t good enough in attack either. Ake would balance the whole side."
