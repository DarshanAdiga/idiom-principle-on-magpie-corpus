Some supporters pushed back against the notion that Trump is shirking his presidential duties.
 "The president is out there as much as he's ever been on Twitter, and the White House team are moving ahead with budget and staffing priorities," said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Republican donor and Trump backer.
 He added, "The president is understandably focused on the ballot counting, but at some point soon he needs to turn his attention back to the lame duck session and putting a capstone on his first four years."

By Kanishk Gaur      In a festive season in India brands bringing sweetness in the market experienced the unimagined threat “Locked /Encrypted computer Systems’ with key held by an unknown enemy. Yes, it’s ransomware attacks on sweet brands such as Haldiram and Mithaas. Many more were attacked in a matter of few days.      The primary offline business of consumer food brands became online during the pandemic as result of the lockdown. However, post lockdown and festive season starting majority of these brands have been focused on improving supply chain and not ever taken security and privacy of customer seriously.     
 With ERP system helping them manage demand, supply of products and manage inventory the entire expansion mode of these food retail brands from conventional brands to large franchise has happened through use of Digital Technologies.      With a large database of consumers with choices of food, taste and preferences, the food retailers do keep tab of customer need and manage inventory, supply chain.      Each of these brands today has more than 500 plus franchise, owned and managed food outlets. Be it shopping malls, airports, residential societies these consumer food retail brands command the food habits of Indian Consumers.      So why would hacking group target these food retail joints?      Market Share and Consumer Data highlighting transaction, food habits and person identifiable information (PII) today held by these food retailers has enormous potential in the dark web for sale.      Big Data techniques applied to data sets captured to these organizations could reveal astonishing trends and be used to analyze consumer buying trends. This data is gold for any brand looking to make significant inroads into Indian Food retail market. This data reveals strategic trends, buying patterns and demand lifecycle of Indian consumers with geolocation.     
 A database which reveals food shopping trends for large food retail brands across airports, malls, cinemas, food joint and exports is what exactly many firms have been many global firms have been eyeing for a long time.      A large number of Private Equity Funds, Venture Capitalist and Global Food brands have been eyeing Indian Food retailer industry and see huge potential in India. The data captured through ransomware attacks on these brands could reveal serious findings and enable decision making, plan investment moves.      The American food and retail industry has been big fan of Indian consumer data and has been relying on sources from traditional market research firms to capture insights. However, consumer data captured from existing food retailers is gold because it not only reveals customer insights but also their market strategy.      With Bitcoin payments accepted by hackers the source and purchaser of data remain anonymous today, hacks such as these have enormous potential for hacktivists.      The private equity funds and American Breakfast & Cereal businesses have been eyeing investment in Indian Food Retail businesses butto complex structure and ownership of different member’s investment decision haven’t seen light of day.      Kellogg’s for example did get into active engagement with Haldiram valuing in more than $3 Billion but deal hinged due to not all three families coming together to deliver clean Intellectual property.      Another issue is transforming family driven business to corporative run enterprises which takes while and lot of time brings rifts between promoter driven family businesses and PE’s funds due to different nature and style leading business. Private equity funds post access to capital seek professional managed work environment, compliances, professional teams and proper management of funds.      However, issue with family run traditional business is many don’t see eye to eye with PE funds due to nature and style of running business. Lot of times promoters of these organization feel PE invest in their business to learn and create replica which would compete with them in the market and lack of loyalty.      In multiple business today such Potato Chips, Noodles, Beverages these brands today compete with Pepsi, Yum, Nestle, Coca Cola etc. The larger market these brands are trying to compete with these global brands is breakfast and cereals market, hence hacks at this point of time could dent their businesses.      A critical analysis of IT, Cyber Security posture of this organization reveals lack of Cyber Security function within these consumer food brands. The IT environment is traditionally run on open source or few commercial tools and patch management cycle is not up to date.      Basic check of vulnerability assessment and penetration testing have never been done or carried out vendor which typically uses basic security tools and cyber professionals who are mid-level skilled. The ransomware attacks on these companies caught them off-guard hence now they are trying mature their IT Security Systems by setting up proper security functions and engaging leading cyber security firms for proactive monitoring of their IT environment.      However, data once compromised leaves too many dents in their business strategy and give competitive advantage to firms buying their data through dark web channels leveraging bitcoin payments.       _The author is Founder, India Future Foundation_       _   _

"I think that the president was prohibited from getting a lot of his agenda done because so much time and effort had to be put against defending against these," he said.
 Several Trump supporters interviewed by The Associated Press in recent days were rankled by widespread celebrations of Biden's win in liberal cities. They saw hypocrisy in the public, outdoor gatherings after Democrats condemned Trump supporters for attending big rallies -- some were held indoors -- amid the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Sad" is how Lori Piotrowski sums up her mood. The president of the Boulder City Republican Women club in Nevada at first sounds much like any other deflated supporter.
 "You always want your candidate to win. You're a little let down. You worked hard," she said.
 But Piotrowski also described herself as "extremely" surprised by the result of the election. She's struggling to reconcile her version of the campaign with the results. She says she saw so many images of large Trump rallies in the final days. On a recent drive from Las Vegas to Reno -- through rural, GOP-leaning Nevada -- she saw only Trump signs and banners, she said.
 "The votes didn't reflect that amount of enthusiasm. I just find that very surprising," she said. "It makes me wonder."
 Biden won Nevada by racking up votes in the state's urban areas.
 Piotrowski, like many Trump supporters, wants to see Trump's legal challenges continue. A massive surge in mail voting and the slower tally of those votes has made the vote count look unfamiliar and strange. Piotrowski said it concerns her that races were called with so many ballots outstanding, although that is often the case.
 "It just seems to me that there's a lot of things that can be improved in the system so that people felt more confident," she said.
 She said she hasn't listened to any of Biden's speeches since Election Day.
 Za Awng, of Aurora, Colorado, is also suspicious of the vote count.
 Awng, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Myanmar, has embraced Trump as a politician who echoes his conviction that China's influence in the world must be sharply curtailed, and as one who shares his Christian values.
 This spring, Awng lost his job as a chef for two months when the pandemic forced the closure of the restaurant where he works. Back at work now, he credits Trump with working hard over the last four years to improve the economy. It was hard for him to grasp how the president could lose.
 "I believe there is something wrong," he said, pointing to what appear to be Democratic shifts in the tally but were a result of mail-in votes being counted later. Democrats were more likely than Republicans to cast mail ballots after Trump baselessly declared mail voting fraudulent.
 "I hope there will be counting again and maybe it will change," he said.
 Even in less tense times, Jim Czebiniak seeks solace in hours of evening prayer. So when Czebiniak, an avid Trump supporter who lives in the upstate community of Knox, New York, heard that Biden had been declared the winner, he turned once again to worship in a search for answers.
 "First of all, I went to the Lord and I asked him why, why is it going like this? The Lord said, 'Because I'm working on stuff. Just relax and let things work themselves out,'" said Czebiniak, 72, who is semi-retired from a career writing custom software.
 "To quote what's-his-name from the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger: 'You can't always get what you want,'" Czebiniak said.
 Still, Czebiniak said he is far from ready to accept a Biden presidency. He cited several unsupported claims made by the Trump campaign.
 "The election isn't really called yet," Czebiniak said, days after all the major U.S. television networks and the AP examined vote counts in key states to declare Biden the overall winner. "I don't trust anything that's going on there with all this vote counting."
 Unlike many Trump supporters, Michelle Sassouni wasn't shocked by the outcome of the election or the aftermath.
 The 29-year-old in Tampa, Florida, is an active member of her region's Young Republicans Club and a co-host of a video show, "Moderately Outraged." She floated the idea of Biden's nomination, and potential to win, months ago.
 "Everyone laughed at me on the show," she said. With many liberal friends, she had seen the strong opposition to Trump. She even understands it somewhat. "I don't love everything he does, but I voted for him because I'm a Republican."
 But Sassouni doesn't see danger in Trump's vow to fight the results in court. People need to be reassured of the results, and a court fight might give them confidence, she said.
 "If you voted for Joe Biden, wouldn't you want to know that he won fair and square so that there's not this cloud over his head?" she asked. "If half the country believes there was some sort of election tampering, then that creates distrust in the system, that creates distrust in Western democracy as a whole."
 Martin, the retiree in Mississippi, says she's planning to resume her daily life, tending to her animals and avoiding talking about the country's change in leadership as a way to deal with the stress and trepidation she feels.
 "I'll go out in the yard to check and talk to my chickens and say my old- fashioned hymns and get by," she said.

In another head-scratching moment, as the campaign tried to stop the vote count in Philadelphia last week, a judge tried to get to the bottom of a Republican complaint over observer access in the room where election workers were processing mail-in ballots.
 "I am asking you as a member of the bar of this court, are people representing the Donald J. Trump for president (campaign) in that room?" U.S. District Judge Paul S. Diamond asked.
 "There's a nonzero number of people in the room," campaign lawyer Jerome Marcus replied.

The low point of the effort undoubtedly came Saturday, when Giuliani held a news conference outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia just after the race was called for Biden. Standing in the shadow of a sex shop and a crematorium, just down the road from a state prison, Giuliani called a disgruntled poll watcher to the microphone to discuss the "shenanigans" in the city. Political observers tuning in from nearby Trenton, New Jersey, immediately recognized the man as a convicted sex offender and perennial candidate for office.
