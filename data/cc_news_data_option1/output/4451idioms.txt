Paris, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 2nd Nov, 2020 ) :Spanish veteran Feliciano Lopez said on Monday that the vastly reduced prize money on offer for tennis players is the "best we can have" after setting up a Paris Masters second-round tie against Rafael Nadal.
 The final ATP Masters event of the season started at Bercy Arena on Monday behind closed doors and just days after France began a second coronavirus lockdown.
 The winner of this year's tournament will pocket just over 20 percent of the cheque taken home by 2019 champion Novak Djokovic.
 "I want to be clear. I think this is... The best we can have right now," Lopez said after his 7-6 (13/11), 6-1 first-round win over former runner-up Filip Krajinovic.
 "We have to be aware of the situation that the world is living and how everyone is facing these challenging times around the world.
 "For now I don't see any hope on prize money. I think it will stay the same for a while." Paris Masters tournament director Guy Forget has said that the event had been helped financially by the other Masters series events and the ATP.
 Organisers were expecting to welcome 1,000 fans each day to Bercy Arena, but instead had to refund the tickets after French President Emmanuel Macron announced the new lockdown measures last week.

They thought it was easier to buy public approval than to earn it.”
