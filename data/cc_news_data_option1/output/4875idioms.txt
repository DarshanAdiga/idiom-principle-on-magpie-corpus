We are learning as we go along about the effects of the pandemic on different demographic cohorts and will continue to do so long after it abates. But, the effects would not be so devastating if positive interventions are made now to mitigate the situation later. One which brooks no delay is that of the psychological impact this has had on students, both in school and college.The story of a promising young girl from Telangana, a merit student at a prestigious Delhi college, who ended her life as her family could not afford a laptop for her to continue her studies, is heartbreaking. Weighed down by humiliation and hardship, she seemed unable to turn to anyone for help. This shows the extent of isolation young people are undergoing during this pandemic.Social distancing and isolation have pushed the young from poor families even more to the margins than before. Without access to education or jobs, they are much more prone to depression. Counselling, especially for those without the means, is simply not available in the over-stretched public health system. The pandemic has taken up time, resources and personnel and the mental health of young people is not a priority; it never really was.For young people, school or college is more than just a place to acquire an education. In schools, children can avail at least one meal in many places, get extra tuition free of cost, get away from the chores and responsibilities that their socio-economic environment foists on them. It inculcates a sense of physical and mental well-being that is destroyed by isolation and despair over the future. For young college students, the campus offers social networks, exposes them to new ideas and avenues, creates aspirations far beyond their social milieu at home. When that is taken away so suddenly, the shock proves too much for so many.Mental health issues manifest themselves in many ways, from insomnia to eating disorders to emotional swings to self-harming, all of which can be treated given the right interventions. But, in many homes, disturbing behaviour patterns in a young person are rarely seen as warning signs; rather they are dismissed as just acting up or, in young children, being extra difficult. During this pandemic, it must also be remembered that young people have had to bear the loss of loved ones, often a parent, or had to witness illness personally. Even normal grieving processes have been curtailed in this pandemic, leading to further stress and strain on young people.The government and non-governmental organisations need to make a greater effort to communicate with young people either online where it is available or through health workers. The ministry of health and family welfare has a national helpline to reach out to children on mental health issues due to the pandemic but not too many are aware of it. The pandemic has given us an opportunity to set right so many things wrong in our public health system. Mental health should be a major part of it and all efforts should be made to reach out to young people. Sometimes, all that is required is just a few words of comfort, of hope that things will turn the corner. This can reduce needless mental suffering and save many promising young lives.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal

Royal Enfield’s Make-it-Yours (MiY) software platform has helped generate between 80% and 90% of demand for all its products, said CEO Vinod Dasari.
 “A buyer can use the MiY platform to choose, for example, from among 5,00,000 permutations and combinations, to order the Meteor model. So much so that, you can design your own motorcycle and we would put your name on it and ship it out to you,” he added.
 Normally, that promise would have been kept within 48 hours of such a booking, but unanticipated demand for the Meteor — introduced earlier this month — has meant customers go through a waiting period.
 Mr. Dasari, who joined the motorcycle maker from Ashok Leyland in April 2019, has committed to introducing one new model every quarter over the next five years.
 Highlighting the three-pronged approach the company is using to pursue growth, he said Royal Enfield would significantly ‘enhance its products’ and offer a range to meet different aspirations of customers within the mid-segment market, pursue growth outside of India, and focus on the aftermarket business.
 “Over the next few years, we plan to offer new variants, models and even new platforms on which new bikes would be built,” he said. “Second, our network growth has been faster outside India; we built a plant in Argentina, we are building one in Thailand. Third, there is huge opportunity in accessories, spare parts, and after-sales service that we are tapping,” the CEO added.
 ## Lockdown impact
 Local lockdowns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the company’s supply chain. Mr. Dasari said, “Our supply problems have been outside of our own factories, especially in the Pune-Aurangabad belt.” In the long run, we have to look at alternatives nearby.” To a query, he said less than 5% of Royal Enfield’s supplies came from China. He pointed out that the company’s Studio Store concept, introduced 18 months ago, had found favour with its rural clientele.
 “During the pandemic, demand pull-up from tier 3 towns was faster than from tier 2,” Mr. Dasari said.
 “Our Studio Store takes one-tenth the cost and space needed for our usual store format, but comes with the same retail identity as existing dealerships and with the entire portfolio of motorcycles, in addition to service and spares,” he added.The company had originally aimed for 200 such compact-format stores but has seen the count touch 800 now. “Even amid the pandemic, we added 133 in the second quarter ended September.”
 In October, the company saw a 7% decline in total sales from a year earlier to 66,891 units. Of these, exports accounted for 4,033 units. In September, the motorcycle maker had shown marginal year-on-year growth of 1% in total sales. Year-to-date sales contracted 35% in the April-October period, compared with a 41% shrinkage in April-September this year.

Ghaziabad Members of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), led by their leader Rakesh Tikait, broke police barricades at the UP Gate border with East Delhi on Saturday afternoon and later decided to make a night stay below the UP Gate flyover in Ghaziabad. However, the gathering of farmers on Saturday was estimated at about 500 as against the mammoth gathering, observed in October 2018, during the Kisan Kranti Yatra at the same venue. The BKU members said that on Saturday, they broke the barricades put up at the Delhi- Ghaziabad border at the UP Gate in order to enter Delhi. There was hardly any resistance put up by the Ghaziabad Police. Later, BKU members decided to return to UP Gate flyover area in Ghaziabad to stay for the night. "After breaking the barriers, we took our vehicles up to the Ghazipur area where the Delhi Police had deployed dumpers. So, we returned back to the UP Gate. We have decided that we will make a night stay below the UP Gate flyover as we decide on the strategy to enter the national Capital," said Rajvir Singh, state vice-president, BKU. The area below the UP Gate flyover is the same site where the BKU members and farmers on October 2, 2018, had clashed with the Delhi Police while trying to enter Delhi over their 15-point agenda, including a demand of a blanket loan waiver, revoking NGT's ban on 10-year-old diesel run tractors in NCR, reduction in electricity tariff, implementation of MS Swaminathan Commission recommendation on remunerative prices and payment of sugarcane arrears, among othersOn Saturday morning, the Ghaziabad Police had made arrangement for a large-scale deployment of police personnel at the UP Gate and also at Delhi-Meerut Road, from where the BKU groups entered Ghaziabad district from Meerut in a bid to reach Delhi as part of 'Dilli Chalo' protest. "There was no untoward incident at the UP Gate and the farmers have opted for a sit-in below the UP Gate flyover. They have planned to stay for the night. In view of this, we have decided to divert traffic. Commuters coming from Mohan Nagar will not be allowed to take a left turn towards UP Gate. Instead, they will have to go to Kaushambi from where they can enter Delhi," said Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police, City 2. . "The commuters travelling on NH-9 will also not be allowed to come down to the UP Gate flyover. Instead, all vehicles will be diverted over the flyover. This arrangement will be in place till farmers continue their protest at UP Gate," he added. Traffic congestion on Delhi-Meerut RoadDelhi-Meerut Road witnessed congestion on Saturday afternoon as traffic from Ghaziabad moving towards Meerut was diverted to the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) Road, instead of being allowed to go straight to Modinagar and Meerut as a precautionary measure. "We were stranded for over an hour at Muradnagar as traffic was moving at slow pace. The other side of the Delhi-Meerut Road was without any traffic and cops were using it for letting the farmers move towards the UP Gate," said Arun Tyagi, a commuter from Modinagar. The cops said that the traffic was diverted to the UGC Road in wake of procession of the farmers coming in from Meerut. "The BKU members and their supporters were diverted towards the UP Gate.Traffic on the other side was also diverted towards the UGC Road. The diversion only lasted for about two hours after which traffic normalised. The farmers had an estimated strength of about 400 to 500 and were moving in 40 to 50 vehicles," said Neeraj Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural). The farmers reached the UP Gate by about 3.30pm, where they decided to camp for the night. "We will sit here and decide on our next course of action.The barrier will now be removed and people will be able to go smoothly to Delhi. There were no discussions with farmers over the issue of minimum support price. If need be, we will go to Delhi and witness the Republic Day on January 26," Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of BKU, told reporters at UP Gate. Meanwhile in Gautam Budh Nagar, another group of farmers trying to go to Delhi was intercepted at the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday afternoon."They were stopped near Jewar, after which they camped at the side of the Expressway. There wasn't any traffic disruption and it was a peaceful gathering. No police action was needed," said additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3, Vishal Pandey.The farmers dispersed after handing over their memorandum to the police and administration officials. Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and parts of western UP have been trying to enter Delhi in a bid to raise voice against the farmer's bill and the minimum support price system.

Greater NoidaSix people were killed in two separate road accidents on the Yamuna Expressway on Saturday morning in areas under Beta 2 and Jewar police jurisdictions. In the first incident, four men travelling from Agra were killed, while a fifth person was severely injured when the SUV they were travelling in rammed a roadways bus at 6.45am on the Yamuna Expressway."We were travelling from Azamgarh to Delhi. Nearly 2 kilometre from the zero point on the expressway, an Innova car rammed into our bus from behind. Luckily none of the 40 passengers on board were injured. Those in the car were in a very poor state," said Vijay Bahadur Singh, the bus driver. The passengers then called the police helpline (112), after which a team rushed to the spot. Police officials said that the car was so badly mangled that it took them a long time to rescue the passengers. By the time they were pulled out, four men had already succumbed to their injuries, while the fifth person was rushed to Kailash hospital where he continues to remain critical.

Police officials suspect that the Innova was travelling at a very high speed and the driver may have dozed off behind the wheel leading to the crash. "The car was in a very bad state. We have informed the families of the victims and the bodies have been sent for autopsy. Prince is still very critical," said additional deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Vishal Pandey. Police officials said that the men worked for an event organizing company and were returning to the city after an event in Agra when the accident took place.

Their bodies were sent for an autopsy and their families were informed," said Umesh Bahadur Singh, station house officer, Jewar police station. The deceased were identified as Pappu (32) and Dhananjay Kumar (50). Singh said that the driver of the bus fled the spot after the accident but the vehicle was seized. Police officials suspect that the bus had just dropped off a wedding party nearby and was driving back, when the mishap happened . "We are waiting for the family members to come and file a complaint after which a case will be registered. Meanwhile, a search has been launched for the driver," said the SHO.

It takes a certain amount of grit to run a small local business, especially in 2020. The last several months have been a challenge. But your hardy Lehi shop owners are your friends and neighbors. Their businesses are not owned by a private equity firm out of New York or traded on a stock exchange. Your purchase makes a lot of difference to them, and they are counting on you to help them stay in business. They are part of what makes our community different. They add color and flavor (literally) to Lehi. Let’s support them instead of ordering from Amazon or the big box stores this year. You may have to get in your car to buy the items, but that trip will do you good as you peel yourself off the couch and away from the computer or phone. You might find a friend to share a quick word. Or find just the right gift. You can share a kind thought or a smile. You know, we can tell you’re smiling, even from behind a mask. And just for a moment, the world will be a little brighter, and the pandemic a little less severe. All because you shopped in Lehi.

Childs, Helen age 84, of Traverse City, passed away August 27, 2020 in her home surrounded by her family. Helen was born on January 14, 1936 in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada to the late Charles and Rhoda Randle. She grew up in Owen Sound, Ontario alongside her parents and younger brother, Art. Helen's father, a ship's captain on the Canadian and US waterways, was frequently away from home for work. For brief periods, the family often joined him on the ship. After graduating from Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute, she received her teaching certificate from Stratford Teachers College in Stratford, Ontario, Canada and taught third grade at Hillcrest Public School. Helen married Ross Childs, in 1958, and they moved to Ann Arbor so Ross could complete his engineering degree at U of M. Though Helen and Ross attended the same grade school, they became close friends and life partners in high school. According to Ross, "you can't know my Helen unless you understand the word, "friend," If ever there was a word that perfectly described Helen, it would be friend." Ross and Helen's strong involvement with hockey, not only at U of M, but with the Ann Arbor Amateur Hockey Association, led to a lifelong passion that brought joy to them and many players, families and communities. Helen even took on the responsibility of repairing over 600 uniforms! She was appointed to the Ann Arbor Amateur Hockey Association board, and served for 15 years. John Bacon and Dave McGuigan, two men who originally knew Helen through hockey more than forty years ago, have said that Helen was an individual who entered their young worlds and through her caring and dedication, lovingly changed the course of their lives, forever. In Ann Arbor, Helen was employed as the secretary for the Executive Assistant to the Dean of the Medical School. Helen and Ross became parents to Mary Elizabeth, October 29, 1959, Scott Randle, January 31, 1964, and Susan Elizabeth, June 3, 1973. In 1976, Helen, Ross and family moved to Traverse City. Later, in the summer of 1976, while visiting her grandparents in Canada, their daughter Susan, 3, was struck by a car and thrown 100 feet. She was rushed by ambulance to the Hospital for Sick Children, in Toronto, where she experienced a long hospitalization and numerous surgeries, resulting in life-long implications. To be together, the family's life revolved around traveling between Traverse City and Toronto. In 1979, the family suffered a severe blow when their son, Scott, 15, was killed instantly by a careless driver while he was riding in a car with other young hockey players returning home from practice. No one else was seriously injured. After Scott's death, Ross and Helen sought refuge and meaning through helping other families touched by tragedy. They worked tirelessly to serve their community; efforts that continue to benefit others today. According to Helen's dear cousin, Jane Penton White, "The past earth-shattering grief and deep sorrow in Helen and Ross's lives was transformed by helping those also in terrible pain. They were so compassionate and present in others lives, for as long as they were needed. Helen could ask questions so simply, yet focused on exactly what needed to be talked about. The word "NO" was not in her vocabulary. Her wry sense of humor was her by-line; often a surprise to others. The forces of good seem so fragile in this world, and Helen was that example of good." Helen was employed by Village Press for a brief period of time, immediately finding friends and support. Later, she took a position as church secretary with Faith Reformed Church and found a new home with Pastor Burgess, Jay DeBie and members of the congregation. In 1997, retiring after 16 years of service, she was recognized by everyone in the congregation for her tireless work and wise counsel. Though employed by Faith Reformed Church since 1981, she was a member of The Presbyterian Church. As a very active volunteer in Traverse City, Helen served 29 years as a board member of the Grand Traverse Area Community Living Center, now known as BrickWays, with her dear friend and creator of the organization, Mary Jean Brick. Thereafter, she added a few years of service on the GTA Community Living Center Foundation Board; assisting with fundraising for the acquisition of "College Park", where daughter Mary lived with 5 other ladies (her second family). On the extremely positive side of the Childs family ledger, was daughter Mary's amazing transformation and remarkable spirit. At birth, as the result of spinal issues, doctors predicted Mary would live 6 months. Instead, she had a wonderful life of almost 56 years. Mary knew she was receiving a new body, and would be with Scott when she passed away on October 1, 2015. One of Helen's virtues was her sense of patience when working with others. She was always supportive of any activity in which her family was involved and welcomed exchange students (aka her adoptive family) from South Africa, Leanne, Australia, Carla, Denmark, Eva, Republic of Georgia, Maka, France, Aurelia, Scotland and Curt. Two young men, members of her adoptive family, still refer to her as "Mom". Helen and Ross were privileged to join daughter, Susan, with the Michigan Ambassadors of Music, on a tour of five European countries. Helen, knowledgeable about the inner workings of the tour, became the point of contact for many parents. Helen's outgoing spirit was welcomed by everyone she met. She was a very accomplished knitter and seamstress. She made special clothes for Mary and precious U of M sweaters for family and friends, including newborns. Helen became the First Lady of Rotary District 6290 during Ross's year as Governor. They travelled to over 60 Clubs and made international trips to Australia, Spain and Canada. Rotary further expanded Helen's friends throughout the world. Helen and Ross were blessed by the marriage of daughter, Susan to Chris Moffitt, who gave them the wonderful gift of granddaughter, Carly. Helen cherished her role as Carly's grandmother. She enjoyed gymnastics meets, softball games, spring break trips and campground visits with family and friends. Besides her immediate family and relatives, Helen had many friends who cared dearly about her over the years; Mary McClure, Liz Price Pomeroy, Jan Lyons, Kaireen Morrison, Susie Janis, Joy Berenson, Sally Boudot, Sylvia Keough, Judy Hart and many more. Helen is survived by her husband Ross, daughter Susan and husband Chris Moffitt, and granddaughter Carly Moffitt. She is also survived by her brother Arthur Randle and spouse Judith, nieces Krista Yourt, Katie Randle, Carey Childs Carrick, Monty Childs, Mitchell Childs, Kelly Childs Danard, Kim Childs Hawke, sister- in-law Lorraine Childs and cousins Jane Penton White and Keith Penton. Helen was predeceased by her parents Chuck and Rhoda Randle, children Scott and Mary, father-in-law and mother-in-law Ross and Evelyn Childs, brother-in-law William Childs and sister-in-law Laura Childs and sister-in-law Margaret Childs Kenwell. The family wishes to express heartfelt gratitude to Munson Home Hospice, and in particular, "Angie", for the close relationship and personal care she gave Helen during the last five weeks of her life. It was exceptional and comforting to know that she had no pain and that she picked her own time to leave. Helen's "Celebration of Life", will be held on Saturday April 24, at the Hagerty Center, 715 East Front Street, Traverse City, at 11:00 A.M. The Celebration will be delivered jointly by Pastor Homer Nye and Pastor Mary McClure. Visitation will be one hour preceding, with lunch to follow the Celebration. Memorials may be directed to BrickWays Foundation, 935 Barlow Street, Traverse City, Mi 49686, Munson Hospice, 550 Munson Avenue, Traverse City Mi 49686, or Northwestern Michigan College Foundation, 1701 East Front Street, Traverse City, MI 49686. The family is being cared for by the Reynolds-Jonkhoff Funeral Home in Traverse City, Michigan. Internment will be the following week in Leith Cemetery, Leith Ontario.

Reds skipper Jordan Henderson labelled the decision “baffling” and admitted he would rather play games without the use of the technology.
 He told BBC Sport: "I can't really speak about it because I'll get myself in trouble. If they're offside, you do the line thing, then what can you do?
 "The third one, I don't know, it's not a penalty. You can think I'm biased but if you ask four or five or their lads they will say the same thing. They said it walking off the pitch.
 "You feel as though there are a lot of decisions that go against you but that decision for me today is baffling.

Il sindaco di Latina Damiano Coletta è ricoverato all'ospedale Santa Maria Goretti a scopo precauzionale. Il primo cittadino questo pomeriggio è andato al nosocomio dopo che le sue condizioni di salute si sono leggermente aggravate a causa del Covid. Il sindaco sarà curato all'interno del Goretti e non più a casa come nei giorni scorsi.
 Damiano Coletta era risultato positivo al Covid alcuni giorni fa e si trovava in isolamento presso la propria abitazione. E' stato lui stesso a informare i suoi compagni di partiti e la giunta comunale del ricovero.
 «Oggi mi sono sottoposto a tac polmonare – spiega lo stesso Sindaco Coletta – ed eÌ stata evidenziata una polmonite in fase iniziale. Quindi, su indicazione dei sanitari del Goretti e dopo un consulto con la Dott.ssa Miriam Lichtner, Responsabile del reparto di Malattie Infettive, si eÌ deciso per un ricovero prudenziale per consentire di effettuare una terapia antivirale che puoÌ essere somministrata solo in ambiente ospedaliero. In questi giorni ho ricevuto tantissimi messaggi di auguri e a coloro che mi hanno manifestato vicinanza va il mio piuÌ sentito ringraziamento. Colgo l'occasione per rassicurare tutti: torneroÌ presto a casa».
