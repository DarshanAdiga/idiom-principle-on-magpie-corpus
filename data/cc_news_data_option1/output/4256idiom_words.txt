Donald Trump doesn’t understand that. For four years, he’s led an assault on immigrant communities and our values as a nation of immigrants. He has turned his back on America’s long-standing commitment to refugees, slashing admissions to a record low and tearing thousands of children from their parents’ arms at our border. He’s fanned the flames of hatred, division, and violence in our country with his racist rants – and that was before COVID-19 and the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, fuelled in part by President Trump’s irresponsible rhetoric.

I was proud to support the historic bill that brought the first 130,000 refugees from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1975 and the resolution to welcome them. I voted to boost funding to help Vietnamese arrivals relocate, and ultimately co-sponsored the bill that created our modern refugee system. That commitment to refugees and asylum seekers, to welcoming those seeking safety and fleeing persecution, is essential to who we are as a country. It’s part of what allows the United States to stand as a beacon of freedom and hope, and to lead the world by our example. As president, I will renew our commitment to making sure the United States of America remains a country that welcomes immigrants and refugees, and recognizes the incredible strength we draw from our diversity.

I’ll get real relief out to small businesses. Trump’s corrupt recovery has funneled funds to big corporations, while systematically excluding women- and minority-owned businesses, leaving one in five mom-and-pop shops to close down. In fact, 75% of Asian-owned small businesses weren’t expected to get any first round stimulus funds at all. It’s wrong. I’ve called for guaranteeing relief to qualifying small businesses with 50 employees or fewer, so they can get through today’s crises and build back better. I’ll boost access to credit and capital long-term, with a Small Business Opportunity initiative that will draw $150 billion in public and private investment. I’ll triple the share of federal contracts that go to small disadvantaged businesses. And, I’ll work to ease the language barriers that can hold back immigrant entrepreneurs.      Through it all, my economic recovery plan will reward hard work, not just wealth. The super wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share, but I won’t ask anyone earning less than $400,000 a year to pay a penny more in taxes, period. One independent analysis by economists at Moody’s found that my plan will create 7 million more jobs than the plan President Trump has proposed, and $1 trillion more in economic growth.

I’ll also protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, lowering premiums, deductibles, and prescription drug costs. My administration will also make sure critical health care information is available in more languages, including Vietnamese. I’ll triple funding for underserved public schools and make public college tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 a year, so race, income, or zip code never determine a child’s future. I’ll give first-time homebuyers a boost with a tax credit of up to $15,000, to help families build wealth and pass it down. I’ll fight for good pay, benefits, and safe workplaces, especially for frontline workers risking their lives amid COVID-19.

The Vietnamese refugees who braved danger, sacrifice, and uncertainty to come to the United States are a vital part of our national character.

Today, the Vietnamese American community is more than two million strong, and the United States is better and stronger for their courage, resilience, and immense contributions to communities, large and small, all across the country.

I’ve fought my entire career for immigrants, for small business owners, for hard-working women and men across this country, including Vietnamese Americans, who are looking for a fair shot to make a better life for their families. That’s who built this country. And that’s who I’ll fight for every day as President.      On day one, I’ll ramp up our national response to this virus and make sure that testing, treatment, and ultimately a vaccine is free and easily accessible to everyone. I won’t play favorites between states led by Democrats and states led by Republicans. This pandemic impacts everyone; we have to fight it everywhere.

Donald Trump’s America isn’t a beacon to the world; it’s a flashing red light.
