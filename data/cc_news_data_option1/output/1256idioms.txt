MADRID (AP) — Lionel Messi says he and his Barcelona teammates are taking a 70% cut in salaries because of the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. He says players will also make donations so other club employees are not affected. Messi made the announcement on social media in a letter critical of club officials. It was the latest public confrontation between Barcelona players and club directors. Messi says “it surprises us that within the club there were those who wanted to put us under scrutiny and tried to put us under pressure to do something that we always knew we would be doing.”

Opener “Alone Again” might as well serve as a diagram of all the ways Tesfaye goes wrong over the course of the album. His mumbly delivery is barely intelligible—not a huge loss, the lyrics are almost embarrassingly self- serious. It might be too much to ask Tesfaye to lighten up a bit, but can he at least steer clear of lines that could be sourced from a 2010s emo pop song? Watery arpeggios and aggressive shots of buzzy synths would be effective if they were administered in smaller doses. But on “Alone Again,” Tesfaye ends up engulfed by what should be background noise.

This seems to be a common theme throughout the album. It’s true that hazy soundscapes have always been Tesfaye’s realm of choice. More than that, his signature gloomy alt-trap production is what makes Tesfaye The Weeknd. But on _After Hours_ , his production has gone rogue, upstaging Tesfaye himself. It’s as if the producers, in search of maximum impact, opted to turn every possible dial on the soundboard all the way up and call it a day.

As millions of Americans shelter inside their homes, trying to avoid exposure to the Covid-19 pandemic, many workers continue to risk exposure to the virus on the front lines.

Mr Bezos earlier this month addressed the worries in an open letter to staff, thanking them for their work.
 The company, which is looking to hire 100,000 more warehouse workers in the US to help address the surge in orders, has also said it would boost pay for warehouse staff around the world, including $2 per hour in the US and £2 per hour in the UK, where staff have been told to work overtime.
 However, US lawmakers on Friday questioned Amazon over the number of confirmed cases among its staff, as well as reports of shortages of protective and cleaning supplies.
 The firm earlier faced strikes by workers in France and Italy and has been hit by legal complaints over the issues in Spain, according to a global alliance of unions coordinated by UNI Global Union.
 Monday's call for a strike against Instacart was organised by the Instacart Shoppers and Gig Workers collective, which had accused the company of profiting by putting people making its deliveries "directly in harm's way".
 The organisation said the firm should provide protective gear, offer hazard pay and extend the pay for those unable to work because of the virus, whether due to a required quarantine or pre-existing condition.
 "This is an extraordinary time in history, and as Shoppers, those of us who are able - and have the means to protect ourselves - do want to help those in our community by delivery groceries and supplies," the organisers wrote.
 "But with Instacart neglecting the basic wellbeing of its 150,000+ drivers, we believe there is no choice but to not only walk off but to raise awareness to the company's practices."
 On Sunday, after the call about Monday's strike, Instacart said it was working with a manufacturer to produce its own hand sanitiser and changing its tip policy. It had earlier said it would pay bonuses and provide 14 days of sick leave for its shoppers or part-time employees diagnosed with the disease or placed under isolation orders.
 "We are immensely grateful to the entire shopper community for continually stepping up as household heroes for families who are relying on Instacart now more than ever," the firm said.
 "We are continuing to monitor this situation and working around the clock to make sure we're providing you with the resources and support you need."

Axel Sammrey, dem Coach des Bezirksligisten TV Oyten, fällt sofort ein: „Das hatten wir doch alles schon.“ Recht hat er, doch das ist schon ein paar Tage her. In der Saison 1978/79 wurde die Zeitstrafe bei Amateurspielen als Pilotprojekt eingeführt. Lange Zeit wurde mit dieser Regel gespielt. So auch Axel Sammrey selbst. „Da war ich noch selbst aktiv und durfte auch ab und an ein paar Minuten zugucken“, gesteht der Trainer schmunzelnd. 1992 verschwand die Zeitstrafe wieder aus dem Regelbuch, da damals die Gelb-Rote-Karte eingeführt wurde. Die 1. und 2. Bundesliga hatte sich immer erfolgreich gegen die Einführung gewehrt. Die Wiederbelebung erfolgte 2017. Damals genehmigte das International Football Association Board (IFAB) die Einführung von Zeitstrafen nach Gelben Karten – allerdings nur im Jugend-, Amateur- und Behindertenfußball. Im Jugendbereich setzen einige Landesverbände in Deutschland die Zeitstrafe auch um und verweisen auf einen erzieherischen Effekt.

MOSCOW -- Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin asked regional governors on Monday to consider introducing a partial lockdown to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
 He made his plea after Russia recorded its biggest one-day rise in coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row, with the official tally increasing by 302 to 1,836. Nine people have died after contracting the virus, authorities say.
 Authorities in Moscow have ordered residents to stay at home from Monday, and Mishustin said he thought the measures now needed to be rolled out nationwide.
 "I ask the leaders of (Russia's regions) to pay attention to (Moscow's) experience and to work out the possibility of introducing such measures in their regions," he said.
 President Vladimir Putin said decisive measures had helped Russia win time in its battle to contain the virus and to prevent an explosive infection rate, but that it was vital authorities used that time effectively.
 "This work must be done in reality, I would like to underline this - in reality and not just on paper or for reports. No exceptions whatsoever," Putin told regional heads in comments broadcast on state television.
 Several regions including Kaliningrad, Tatarstan and the Arctic region of Murmansk, which shares a border with Finland and Norway, have already acted. Others have implemented different measures.
 The southern, mainly Muslim region of Chechnya has imposed an entry ban, while several towns run by state nuclear corporation Rosatom that are closed to foreigners have imposed further entry restrictions.
 Murmansk region has restricted entry to the towns of Kirovsk and Apatity where fertilizer producer Phosagro has plants and to other, small industrial settlements. The northern region of Karelia has prohibited the elderly from using public transport.
 Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, a Putin ally, said 20% of residents were ignoring his order to self-isolate, but that he hoped an IT system would be operational by the end of the week that would allow authorities to control the movement of people.
 Under the new rules, Muscovites are allowed to go out only to buy food or medicines at their nearest shop, get urgent medical treatment, walk the dog, or take out the bins.
 "This may now seem to some of you like some kind of game, a kind of Hollywood thriller. This is no game…," Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of the Security Council, said in a video address.
 "Unfortunately, what is happening now is a real threat to all of us and to all of human civilisation," said Medvedev, a former president who was prime minister until earlier this year.
 Some doctors have voiced skepticism about the accuracy of Russia's coronavirus figures given what they say has been the patchy nature and quality of testing, allegations that the authorities deny. (Additional reporting by Anastasiya Lyrchikova and Polina Ivanova, Editing by Timothy Heritage)

Things fall into place, miraculously, on the title track. The production is sparse—there’s plenty of room for Tesfaye’s vocals to drift around. A note pangs insistently, the sound of broken glass clinks gently. The anticipation is ratcheted up so masterfully you don’t even realize you need the beat until it arrives, two minutes in. Tesfaye has finally stumbled upon the kind of infectious melody he’s famous for, and on “After Hours,” he milks it for all it’s worth.

At several points, though, Tesfaye is able to cut back the overgrowth and achieve some clarity. If other tracks borrow ’80s elements in moderation, “Scared To Live” practically transports listeners to a tinsel-heavy 1980s prom. A punched-up drum beat punctuates Tesfaye’s version of an old-school ballad, which has the commercial potential it’s looking for, but not much in the way of creativity. The song crescendoes and mellows down at all the right places. It’s catchy—take it from Elton John and Bernie Taupin. The post-chorus incorporates a snippet from the chorus of “Your Song.” But unfortunately, “Scared To Live” is no match for the latter.

This week is expected to kick off with some scatted rain showers and thunderstorms today while temperatures remain moderately warm with highs in the mid-to-upper 70s through the week and lows in the high 50s range, according to the forecast from the National Weather Service station in Dallas/Fort Worth.
 "There are going to be scattered showers on and off today beginning in the early afternoon and lasting into the evening," meteorologist Jason Dunn with NWS said. "The severe weather threat is pretty low, but you might see some thunderstorms." Showers are expected to start around 1 p.m. and start and stop until around 9 p.m.
 Dunn said possible rainfall amounts could reach anywhere between 0.25 and 0.5 inches, depending on the severity of the showers. The Killeen area has received 7.42 inches of rain since Jan. 1, according to measurements taken at the Killeen/Fort Hood regional airport. Currently, the U.S. Drought Monitor Map shows northwest Bell County — including the Killeen area — as being under abnormally dry conditions.

The Daughters of the American Revolution established a new chapter in Connecticut earlier this year, one that will be based in Stonington. The chapter is named in honor of Abigail Hinman, a revolutionary heroine in New London who took pot shots at Benedict Arnold when she realized he was in the process of destroying her home and the homes of her her friends. Hinman first told him to "knock it off" and then grabbed a musket and fired after his retreating figure. She missed, but was able to save some houses and became a local legend. An organizational meeting for chapter was the Daniel Packer Inne in Mystic and was attended by Connecticut State Regent Christy Hendrie and additional state officers, the 14 organizing members of the chapter, including six new members, plus several prospective members working to complete their paperwork for admission. Anyone interested in joining the organization in the first year will be considered "Charter Members."
