Former Indian cricket team trainer Ramji Srinivasan feels that fitness training for elite athletes will not yield the desired results unless the players are able to participate in competitive action which is not possible during the countrywide lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.
 “Fitness per se in sports is a waste of time if there is no transfer taking place on to the field to give out top class performance. Positive transfer from one to another is the key to fitness,” Ramji told PTI during an interaction.
 “A person can do an Olympic lift of 100 kgs at this stage, but he or she is not guaranteed to be injury-free or have an increase in performance unless there is transfer. Bowlers do take a hit during this phase for sure. Batters not much,” he added.
 Asked if long breaks can be difficult for bowlers, he said, “Oh yes for sure. Bowling is all about rhythm and skill-based fitness. There has to be a transfer from one to another. Just because someone is doing 150 kg deadlift now need not bowl quick or effectively once the match starts soon. Skill-based fitness has taken a hit for sure. More time on the nets more muscle memory is my take on it.”
 With all sporting activity having come to a halt due to the pandemic, Srinivasan, who was strength and conditioning coach of India’s 2011 World Cup- winning squad, said it was a testing time for sportspersons, adding they could keep themselves fit through innovative methods.
 “This is a testing time for them to work on both mentally and physically to reach the desired goal before tournaments start. Since skillset practise is out of question, what they need is to focus on fitness which is one of the key elements in performance and excellence,” he added.
 “Keeping fit through innovative methods, individualised programme from their respective trainers, rehabilitation programme from their physios or injury prevention protocols can be followed. Technology helps to track their daily routine and make them adhere to certain regime effectively,” the CSK trainer said.
 Srinivasan, who is presently working with sportsmen including paddlers A Sharath Kamal and G Sathiyan among others, felt mental fatigue was likely to happen for sportspersons and said, “This is the time where they can focus on varied aspects of mental conditioning and physical conditioning to solve the jigsaw puzzle...”
 Asked what his advice would be to sportspersons at this time, he said it was important to stay positive and think out of the box and work on weaknesses and iron out problem areas.
 “...Stay positive and think out of the box to work out on the weaknesses and iron out the problems area. Now is the time to do it. Allocate time for a specific activity and work on it.
 “Sportspersons always seek time with family since they always are on the move. Now is the time to relish it and enjoy to the fullest,” he added. Srinivasan, who has also worked with the Tamil Nadu cricket team, said online training was a double-edged sword.
 “It’s a double-edged sword. Depends on how one uses it. Consult a professional in using online apps or platform. Something is better than nothing.
 “This technology was not available 10 years back, Since technology is available now, making use of it is prudent. Online training has become the in- thing now and in future, it will hold good for all seasons,” he signed off.

The Illinois State Board of Education has made clear that schools must still address the needs of students eligible for special education services, but less apparent is what qualifies. The U.S. Department of Education has noted schools may not be able to provide all the services they usually do, and indicated schools would “offer flexibility where possible.”
 Chicago Public Schools officials have said they’ll do what they can but, during remote learning, can’t commit to providing the full amount of service minutes outlined in a student’s individualized education plan during remote learning, with teachers not expected to work full days.
 Stephanie Laine-Nazaire said her first grade twins, who attend Murray Language Academy in Hyde Park, are missing out on speech lessons. She said both children, born at 23 weeks, are on the autism spectrum, with one of the boys needing more specialized instruction than the other.
 For one twin, things have been going OK. For the other, "it’s been pretty much heartbreaking,” Laine-Nazaire said. His special education teacher has been posting videos, but they’re not interactive, and he misses his friends, she said. She tried having him sit in online general education classes, but though the teacher has been making an effort to include him, he gets down when he can’t follow along with the reading and math lessons he’d usually be pulled out of.
