Twaddle, of course, is entering the field during strange times. He graduated from UMKC two months after the COVID-19 pandemic first upended daily life across the country in March, as instructors and higher-ups at the dental school scrambled, at first, to figure out what to do.
 But as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled out guidelines for how to best mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, Twaddle and dentists as a whole realized they already had checked many of the boxes. As people around the country clambered to find the proper PPE to meet guidelines, dentists returned to relative normalcy.
 “It didn’t really change how things were done,” Twaddle said, as he recalled the guidelines issued in the spring that include bullet points like masks, gloves and frequent hand washing. “It was like, ‘OK, we’re good. Let’s get back to work.’”
 Dentists’ offices, Twaddle said, were perfectly designed for the pandemic, just as the dentistry field seems to be tailor made for Twaddle.
 His interest in sciences coupled with a passion for people helped guide Twaddle to the field, in which not only his father also works, but also his older brother. Twaddle admired how much his dad seemed to know about each family in Nodaway County saying that he wanted to help people. Dentistry just made sense.
 Still, Twaddle’s path back to the Compass Dental offices in Maryville didn’t come without relative hardship. He married his wife, Andi, in the fall of 2014 after dating for more than seven years. He was the first in his friend group to tie the knot, he said, but as he trekked through 11 years of college while friends had children and started their lives, he grew frustrated at times.
 “I was in it for the long haul,” Twaddle said. “I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, but the tunnel was just really long. So it was frustrating. Because it’s like — I was ready, you know, I wanted to take the next step. But there’s just a lot of hoops. Gotta get through the hoops.”
 Twaddle was one of 3,000 to 4,000 applicants to UMKC’s dental program when he first applied after earning his degree from MU. He interviewed for a spot and was wait-listed, so he took biology courses in Kansas City in an attempt to bolster his resume.
 It worked, of course. Twaddle earned his degree in Biology and was accepted into the dental school. And after four more years of school, he graduated from the program and wound up in the same place he was as a 4-year-old: taking pointers from his dad at his practice in Maryville.

Arguably the most important position to consider in Fantasy Football is running back (RB), as it is notoriously the most difficult position to get a good, reliable player at. So far, anyone who has Alvin Kamara on their team is feeling fantastic, as he is far and away the best NFL fantasy RB through the first six weeks. Kamara is averaging 29.5 fantasy PPG, with Aaron Jones of the Green Bay Packers the next best running back, averaging 23 PPG, 6.5 less than Kamara. Basically, if you don’t have Kamara on your team, trade for him like your life depends on it. Another RB to watch out for in the coming weeks will be the Carolina Panthers star, Christian McCaffrey. Although he’s been injured for the past month, when McCaffrey returns, he’s poised to break out. McCaffrey was averaging 26.7 PPG through the first two games of this season before getting injured, and was the top RB in fantasy football last year. If you still have McCaffrey on your roster, don’t worry, good weeks are coming. Speaking of Carolina Panthers RBs, one of the biggest surprises of the year so far has been Mike Davis, the backup RB to McCaffrey. Since McCaffrey was sidelined with his injury, Davis has been averaging 21.7 PPG as his replacement, making him an unexpected top RB this season. Another somewhat- surprising fantasy RB so far has been James Robinson, a rookie RB on the Jacksonville Jaguars. Robinson is currently a top ten fantasy running back, averaging 17 PPG. Anyone who was able to sneak Robinson onto their rosters this year made a great move.

Hello Paokara family. Sorry for the small delay in saying goodbye to you. Really my life in the last 48 hours has gone crazy. First of all I would like to say that right now I am feeling a mixture of happiness and sadness in my heart. Sadness because I will leave PAOK, a club I love very much and I gave myself 100% to make history together with my teammates. And we managed to do it, it was 4 years, 3 cups of Greece, 2 Greek championships and lots of happiness. I lived in PAOK the best moments of my sports life. But I also have a feeling of happiness mixed with all that, with my departure from PAOK I will have the possibility to return to my city, play for one of the biggest clubs in Brazil and also for the reason that everyone knows that it dad's health problem. I will be able to be close to my family and especially close to my father, who is responsible with my mother, for everything I am today, as a person and athlete. So from that point of view let's say that my departure from PAOK becomes an easier decision. But for that my wish to come true, I needed the help of a very special friend. President Ivan: I am deeply grateful for everything you have done for me, I will always have wonderful memories of you. Thank you !! I leave a lot of friends at the club, in the city and I also crazy fans that I have never seen in my life. You call me El Loco but you are actually the El Loko you should be called Paokara El Loco. it was very good to be with you at Toumba in these 4 years. Thank you for everything, I love you !!!

ATLANTA (AP) — Republican Sen.

Instead, the wealthy businesswoman has followed Trump’s lead and then some and has embraced people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, a congressional candidate even many conservatives consider too extreme. Loeffler's choice has many Republicans worried about how she’d fare in an anticipated January runoff election in a state where Republican dominance is slipping and victory could depend on more moderate voters and independents.

Mark Paul, an assistant professor of economics and environmental studies at the New College of Florida, said the study helped illustrate the economic feasibility of climate action, but he criticized the comparison between one- time stimulus injections and the sustained investment needed for the energy transition. "It's comparing apples and oranges," he said. Extraordinary COVID-19 stimulus spending has been necessary, but exceptional—"a one-time shot," as Paul put it. A holistic climate response would have to address all sectors of the economy—not just energy—and normalize much greater annual expenditures of up to 5 percent of global GDP each year for at least the next 10 years, he explained. Ideally, Paul said these injections would recur automatically each year until the economy was fully decarbonized and the unemployment rate was below 3.5 percent—a proposal he and several other climate experts made in March in an open letter to Congress.

This story is a collaboration with ProPublica Illinois.


   


  Eight months into the pandemic and following pleas from educators and parents, Illinois has decided it will publish data on the coronavirus's spread in schools.


   


  The decision comes two weeks after a story by ProPublica Illinois and the Tribune detailed the lack of information available to school officials and parents as they try to decide whether in-person learning is safe. Illinois public health officials told reporters there had been outbreaks in at least 44 school buildings across the state but declined to say where.


   


  Late Wednesday, an Illinois Department of Public Health spokeswoman said publicly for the first time that the state will start sharing the number of cases and outbreaks by school. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases tied to contact at school.


   


  "We have been working to publish school-level data on COVID-19 and look forward to having that live in the coming weeks," spokeswoman Melaney Arnold said.


   


  That's good news for school workers such as nurse Kathy Knawa, who is part of a team that has been helping Flossmoor School District 161, south of Chicago, decide when in-person classes should resume. When she tried to research COVID-19 outbreaks in schools that had already reopened, particularly near her district, she couldn't find comprehensive state data about the number of cases or where they had been identified.


   


  Instead, Knawa found the ProPublica Illinois/Tribune story, which explained how little was publicly known about school-connected outbreaks during the first seven weeks of the school year.


   


  The lack of specific data from the state is frustrating to Knawa, whose district plans to have some students return to school buildings next week.


   


  "I'm concerned we can't find out where the outbreaks are," Knawa said. "I just want to be able to get information in one place. If all the towns surrounding you were having outbreaks, it would be good to know."


   


  Many other states already publish data on outbreaks in schools. But Illinois so far has released only county-level data about COVID-19 cases in people younger than 20. That age range includes many college students, so it isn't as helpful to parents and officials in K-12 school districts.


   


  In many parts of Illinois, the school year began more than two months ago. Of the school-related outbreaks documented as of early October, most have been small -- two or three cases at each school building -- according to the state.


   


  IDPH's delay in making the data available comes as Illinois is grappling with a surge of COVID-19 cases in many communities. The increases have led some schools that had planned to reopen to delay until at least early next year.


   


  On Tuesday, the Lake County Health Department recommended that public and private K-12 schools transition to remote online learning as the county reported "substantial" community transmission of the virus. In response, Grayslake schools decided to delay any decision to return to school until January, while school officials in Mundelein said they are reconsidering plans that would have put students back in the classroom in the coming weeks.


   


  According to Illinois State Board of Education data, last updated in mid- September, about 685,000 students in 69% of districts are attending school in person at least part time. About 1.2 million students continue to learn online only, including at some of the state's largest school districts.


   


  Chicago Public Schools, by far Illinois' biggest district, plans to bring back preschool and special education students next month. COVID-19 cases are rising in Chicago, but Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said this week that transmission has been low in private schools that have reopened.


   


  The district last week began posting the number of cases, with school locations, in an online COVID-19 tracker. The site, to be updated weekly, shows 172 adult and five student cases between March 7 and Oct. 10.


   


  Other schools also post detailed information. Among them: New Trier Township High School District 203 and Crystal Lake District 47.


   


  New Trier, in Chicago's north suburbs, recently began phasing students in at partial capacity but quickly decided to close again because of increased community spread. The district updates an online dashboard twice a week with the number of cases among staff and students as well as the number in quarantine. Seven students and one staff member had active cases as of Monday, according to the dashboard, but officials say none of the cases was linked to transmission at school.


   


  "Local health departments continue to be the best resource for the most up to date data as schools must report all cases directly to them. Most importantly, schools are also required to communicate with parents and guardians as new cases arise," Arnold said.


   


  Not all districts publicize COVID-19 information about their schools. In west suburban Addison, school social worker Maria Sinkule has been calling on district officials to share data about community and school transmission. Following a hybrid model, with children learning both in person and remotely, preschool and kindergarten students began returning to school earlier this week; older elementary students were to return Thursday.


   


  "I want them to be transparent about what transmission looks like within schools and what are the supports in place for families that need help," said Sinkule, who is also president of the Illinois Association of School Social Workers. "Some schools are looking out for the community, and there are others that don't and they aren't transparent. Without metrics, they can do what they want."


   


  It's not clear when the health department will publish the data that educators are pushing for. Arnold promised data "in the coming weeks" but did not say more about the timing.


   


  The state's largest teachers union has called on IDPH to identify schools with COVID-19 outbreaks, saying "transparency is key."


   


  "How is a community supposed to decide whether to return to the classroom if they don't know the true impact this is having across the state?" Illinois Education Association President Kathi Griffin said in a statement. "Health officials inform communities when nursing homes or jails have outbreaks because it impacts those who live and work there. Certainly, communities are entitled to know about outbreaks at schools. It shouldn't even be a question."

It was signed off by the Democrats before we sent it out; they control the Administration Committee. In the production of these mailers, my former chief of staff hired his brother and somebody else from the office, which technically I don’t think any of that is against the rules. Is it the way I wanted it? No, and the very day I found out about it, I fired him, cancelled the contracts and reported it to the House. We put a review together with all of the information that we knew, and my former chief of staff and his brother were not cooperative with me, and we gave that information to the House.

Miers’ goal on the run ended a run of three straight for Richmond but goals to Kane Lambert and Martin midway through the quarter confirmed Richmond were not only back in the contest, but now in front on the scoreboard. Geelong could not capitalise on their good moments; Ablett loitered with intent as a deep forward but was grimacing with every touch. At the last change, Richmond were two points to the good on the back of a four-goals-to-one third term.

Patterson was indicted in December 2019 on charges of using his official position or office for personal gain, first-degree financial exploitation of the elderly and third-degree theft of property. The State of Alabama filed a petition for forfeiture of the retirement funds July 28, explaining Thursday in front of Judge Stephen Haddock that the funds should be preserved in case Patterson is found guilty and has to pay a large restitution or other costs.


  However, Patterson and his defense attorney, Chuck Warren, argued such a forfeiture would violate Patterson's 6th Amendment right to counsel by taking away funds that would otherwise pay for his defense in the criminal trial. Patterson testified that since retaining Warren, he had accumulated several thousand in legal fees, with more costs expected as they sought out expert witnesses and forensic accounting.


  Patterson said he was employed but making significantly less than he had as a judge, and he and his family had "relied on the kindness of others from time to time" to make ends meet. He testified he was paying his attorney $200 an hour, which in his experience was "standard," and despite the financial struggle, he had no intentions of filing for a court-appointed attorney when there was $36,602.36 possibly available from the RSA.


  Assistant Attorney General Kyle Beckham said ultimately, the state did not want the amount handed over to Patterson in full to be used on whatever Patterson saw fit, suggesting the funds instead be handed over to the court for distribution as needed to pay for legal expenses. Haddock noted that despite receiving a judge's salary for several months after his indictment and after retaining Warren, documents provided by the defense showed Patterson had only made one payment for about one-fourth of the legal fees owed.

A constitutional measure on the general election ballot is lauded by backers as a simple way to keep out-of-state influences out of North Dakota, but opponents call it a power grab and a former governor sees it as a “bad piece of legislation.”
 Measure 2 if passed would require that an initiative to amend the constitution be placed on the ballot only at the general election, which typically has a higher turnout then do primary elections. If approved by the voters, an amendment would move to the Legislature, where both the House and Senate would have to approve. If lawmakers rejected it, it would go back to the voters in the next general election for a final decision.
 The push behind Measure 2 is “a systemic issue of out-of-state interests and money having grand ideas about how we in North Dakota govern ourselves and how we spend our own money,” said Sen. David Hogue, R-Minot, the prime sponsor. He wants to change what he believes is the state’s status as an easy mark for putting a constitutional measure before voters.

Paul Merola
 April 26, 1950 ~ October 16, 2020
 Paul Merola, loving husband, father and hater of ATVs and drones, passed away suddenly the night of October 16th at home.
 Despite his sometimes bear-like demeanor, he was a big softy with a large heart for animals, his family and friends.
 He would always lend a hand or an unsolicited opinion. He loved his spaceship car, fly-fishing, golf, Italy, long walks by the river and playing Words with Friends. He was a storyteller and loved to relive the graduation party he threw for his friends in 1969 as well as the time he caught two foul balls at a Buzz baseball game. He will be missed as well as his homemade pizza that he had perfected over the years but never shared the recipe.
 Never one for sentiment or religiosity, there will be no service as they made him uncomfortable but if you feel so inclined, have a plate of pasta or plant a tree in his honor. Paul would want you to remember him in your own way.
 You could also make a donation in his name to the Audubon Society of Utah as we all know how much he loved his birds. It was almost like a superpower how he could identify a bird no one could even see.
 His wife, Hannah and two daughters, Emily and Natalie, as well as his grandson Xander miss him terribly already.
 Paul was a lot of things to a lot of people but one thing he will not be is forgotten as long as we hold on to his memory.

Authors Karen Russell and Donald Antrim are among 24 MacArthur "genius" fellows announced Wednesday morning (though the news leaked on Tuesday evening). The $625,000 grants from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation are awarded annually, with no strings attached, to "talented individuals who have shown extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction." The foundation wrote that Antrim's "fiction and nonfiction are marked by a contrast between elegant, concise language and the disorienting chaos in which his characters find themselves. Antrim creates fictional worlds that are both commonplace and yet surreal, combining close observations of the banality of everyday life with the absurd." Karen Russell, whose 2011 novel _Swamplandia!_ was a finalist for the Pulitzer, writes "haunting yet comic tales [that] blend fantastical elements with psychological realism and classic themes of transformation and redemption," according to the MacArthur Foundation. Russell told _The Washington Post_ that the award couldn't have come at a better time: "The day after I learned about this, I had to get an emergency root canal, and I don't have dental insurance."

State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest commercial bank, has advised a cautious approach in taking crucial decisions such as any extension of insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) suspension beyond December 25, stating that one would have to weigh pros and cons in continuing a relaxed environment.
 “RBI and government have rightfully (in the current Covid-19 times) given a relaxed environment till the months of September or October. Taking this beyond will actually give an impression that the borrowers are fundamentally weak and banks are likely to go back to square one where we are seen as promoting ever-greening etc. If that were to come as perception in the minds of investors, that would be a major negative for our economy,” Arijit Basu, Managing Director, SBI said at an international conference on IBC, organised by the Indian Institute of Insolvency Professionals of ICAI.
 In the wake of Covid-19 induced lockdown since March 25, the Government had suspended the initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process ( under sections 7, 9 and 10 of IBC) for six months till September 25. This was later extended by three months till December 25.
 “We have to be a little careful in extending IBC suspension beyond December 2020 or say March 2021. How a global investor perceives India is very important. As we go ahead supporting our borrowers and corporate system, at the same time we are mindful of rise in bad debts in system that may arise,” Basu said.
 Basu said that most of mid sized and large corporates have managed their cash flows well during the Covid-19 times. “There is lot of global investor interest in stressed assets of India. We are in touch with private equity players. As things open up, India will once again begin aspiring to become $ 5 trillion economy as fast as possible. Our journey towards transparency and journey towards having mechanisms like IBC should not fall back . We should try and sustain those which have made our system look more transparent,” Basu said.
 He also said that SBI sees Indian economy showing strong revival in 2021-22 itself.
 “What is needed a balancing act. If the Indian economy has to do well, banks have to be strong and they have to be perceived to be strong. You can be a strong Bank provided you have the muscle and resources. For the banks, muscle and resources comes from capital. Banks must be able to access market and capital at a reasonable cost,” Basu said.

"Of course the feeling of actually flying will be better, because there's the excitement of going to a new destination, to explore a new destination, and even though we can't do it now due to Covid, this is a good substitute for now, to recreate the feels of taking a long-haul flight," he said.

Having six teams at U18s gives everybody an opportunity and they’re all coached by good staff members who are teachers here as well. When you have so many players and you improve lads like we do, a lot more will move on to the next stage.

The 2012 trip to Texas Tech is one that many associated with the West Virginia football program wish they could forget for obvious reasons.
 The No. 5 Mountaineers rolled into Lubbock undefeated and fresh off a road victory over Texas, but ran into a buzz saw in 49-14 loss to the Red Raiders. It was a game that wasn’t even close, as West Virginia fell behind 35-7 before halftime and the offense never could find its footing and the defense couldn't get off the field.
 It was the game that started a downward spiral for the Mountaineers, who would lose five of their next seven games in the first year in their new league. The Big 12 honeymoon was over in a gust of west Texas wind.
 Coincidentally enough, two very key components to the 2020 edition of the West Virginia football team had strong rooting interests on the opposite sideline that day.
 Head coach Neal Brown then a young assistant was in his second season as the offensive coordinator for the Red Raiders and helped propel the scoring outburst.
 While it was just another stop on the career ladder for Brown, it was just another Saturday for current WVU starting quarterback Jarret Doege. That’s because he grew up in the areas and was only a kid in the stands rooting for his older brother Seth during that 2012 game. Yes, that same Seth Doege who was the signal caller for the Red Raiders and tossed six scores against the Mountaineers defense.
 “Jarret and I will talk about going back to Lubbock, but it's not something we're going to spend a lot of time on,” Brown said.
 Doege often attended the games in Lubbock to watch his older brother but that one obviously had special meaning given the scope of the win and Seth’s play. He even admits to throwing his fair share of tortillas onto the field, one of the pre-game traditions at Tech over the years.
 In fact, it was during his time around the Texas Tech football program where he met Brown at various football camps. That seeds of that relationship obviously proved critical down the road when Doege was looking for a landing spot after electing to leave Bowling Green.
 But when the clock hit zeros on that mid-October day in 2012 and the game was over with the upset complete, Doege raced onto the field to share a moment with his older brother.
 “I rushed the field and ran around. I tried to find my brother but couldn’t find him and just kind of enjoyed the experience of getting to rush the field and was hoping I could do that one day,” he said.
 Now a little over eight years to the date, the younger Doege is hoping reverse the roles. He is expected to be accompanied in the stands with 15+ friends and family who still reside in the area and is excited to be playing quarterback in the Big 12 like his brother did before him.
 “Seeing him sling the ball around, made me want to go play in an air raid offense like that. I’ve gained a lot of knowledge from him and I still do today,” the younger Doege said.
 The Mountaineers have won the previous three meetings in Lubbock, but 2012 still remains in the memory of many of those that are associated with either program. It won’t change the past, but two figures that were in the stands are hoping for a different outcome this time around.
 And nobody can blame the wind this time.
 "I don’t think it’s a huge deal. You just have to tighten your spiral down and put maybe a little more velocity on it. There’s no secret to it or key to it you just throw the ball in the wind," Doege said.

Frustrating as it can be': CenterPoint's frequent outages happen rain or shine, customers say


--DocBreak--
One day after Gov. Charlie Baker ordered hockey rinks in Massachusetts shuttered because of COVID-19 concerns, parents gathered up their children's gear and headed home from rinks around the state.


  And while the financial impact to the rinks will be difficult, some businesses near the arenas are hoping the patrons who come in before, during or after hockey practices will keep supporting them.


  "It's disheartening," Mike Gardner, the general manager at Bay State Brewing Company said. "But we know our hockey families are very loyal."


  Bay State Brewing Company opened inside the Worcester Ice Center on Harding Street shortly before the novel coronavirus took hold.


  While that has presented a challenge, Gardner said the pub has been able to weather that storm because of loyal patrons and a small menu of good food.


  "The food is quite good, not your typical pub food," Gardner said. "People get something they don't expect."


  He said hopefully those things will carry Bay State Brewery Company through the next two weeks as the ice center closes down its rinks in accordance with the new regulations.


  Baker made the announcement on Thursday, giving skating facilities until Friday evening to close and setting a reopening date of Nov. 7. The decision came after the state Department of Public Health announced that there have been at least 30 clusters of COVID-19 associated with organized ice hockey activities.


  Those involved residents from more than 60 municipalities in the state. Each of the clusters includes two or more confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases, for a total of 108 confirmed cases, the DPH said.


  At the Worcester Ice Center, Derek Alafam said the staff will remain employed and will be doing maintenance, cleaning and setting up for any new requirements that might be foisted upon the rinks before Nov. 7.


  "The building itself is open," he said. ""We've been following the protocols if not going above and beyond."


  At the New England Sports Center in Marlboro, visitors were being asked to sign in and while the Junior Bruins were playing a game Friday afternoon, there were few spectators.


  The facility's assistant general manager, Jamie O'Leary, said the shutdown will likely impact The New England Seafood Restaurant on the second floor.


  It was unclear whether the restaurant would remain open for the two weeks, O'Leary said, because the news of the rink closures was less than 24-hours old and many specifics hadn't been worked out. The pro shop's response was also being mulled.


  "We're still deciding what to do with staff," he said.


  Friday afternoon, outside the New England Sports Center, a young boy left the rink, his mother carrying his gear and a younger child as he toted his hockey stick. As they walked toward their car, the boy slowed and looked back several times toward the rink.


  Nearby, a store called Pure Hockey had few, if any, customers inside Friday as the last day of hockey wound down.


  At the Solomon Pond Mall, a short distance away, restaurants see some traffic related to the rink but didn't expect to notice a drop off in business due to the closure.


  O'Leary said that like the Worcester Ice Center, staff are just, "making sure the (hockey) experience feels normal for kids."


  In Worcester, not far from the Worcester Ice Center, Maddi's Cookery & Taphouse experienced a normal day Friday.


  Manager Alex Dos Santos said she doesn't think the shutdown will have an impact on the eatery since they don't generally see a lot of hockey families.

Now, we come to wide receivers (WR), where one of the biggest fantasy surprises of the season has presented itself to us. As things stand, Travis Fulgham, a WR on the Philadelphia Eagles, is averaging the most fantasy PPG amongst WRs, putting up 21.5 PPG on average thus far. However, as impressive as that statistic is, it should be taken with a grain of salt, as he has only played three games so far, about half as many as the rest of the WRs. Over the next few weeks, it will be important to see if Fulgham can keep it up. But that being said, I would try to strike while the iron is hot and get him on your team ASAP. Now, as far as WRs who have been active all six weeks go, Calvin Ridley of the Atlanta Falcons has been the best so far, averaging 20.2 fantasy PPG. But, Ridley’s not the best WR by much, as Davante Adams, D.K. Metcalf, DeAndre Hopkins, Adam Thielen, Jamison Crowder and Stefon Diggs are all averaging only about one point or half a point less than Ridley is per game. So, if you have any of these WRs on your team, that’s fantastic. However, if you don’t have any of them on your team, I would try to trade for at least one of them, as they are likely to outscore your WRs any given week if your opponent has any of them on their team.

Whatever the reason, the campaigns have gone from something that started online as moral panic (complete with man-on-the-street interviews courtesy of Asian Boss) to something people are interested in documenting… and, in some cases, use to their advantage.


  While the bulk of the initial online reaction highlighted the aghast, one trend proved to be prophetic. YouTubers created practical video guides offering such things as an overview of the campaign and an explanation of how people navigate the quirky system of applying for a discount. Uploads then started to focus on the nitty gritty, and more kept coming as the months passed. One of YouTube’s most important functions in the online ecosystem is as a how-to depository — for those moments when people need to make a pasta sauce from scratch or remember how to tie a necktie — and the Go To Travel campaign has gone from something talked about in serious tones by news channels and always-engaged Twitter users to a potential lifestyle activity in pandemic times.


  The next step for the once-besieged government campaign was to become something people eagerly took part in and shared online. Instagram was ahead of the curve in this respect, and it was arguably the only leading social media platform on which users fantasized about where they’d want to go instead of just condemning the campaign. That only intensified as Go To Travel kicked off, and thousands have shared their trips through #gototravel, a trend that carried over to short-form video app TikTok albeit with less overall content shared. Even Twitter, a site that tends to reward negativity compared to similar online sites, loosened up, with a fair amount of people sharing photos from their Go To trips.


  Perhaps not surprisingly, the most ambitious creations were uploaded onto YouTube. Alongside all those how-to guides soon came actual footage of people simply enjoying trips around the country. This type of content isn’t anything new, but after months during which a video like this would be heavily frowned upon given the pandemic, seeing people hanging out in hotels and flying felt somewhat cathartic.


  YouTuber Onoda started out with instructional videos on how to utilize the Go To Travel campaign, before showing how consumers could really live it up. Others, like the person behind the channel aberage TV, documented every trip they took via the campaign, starting in Sendai and expanding farther afield. Plenty of lesser-viewed videos entered the ecosystem as well.


  The Go To Travel campaign has since become a genuine source of feel-good content for creators across Japan. It’s no longer nearly as hotly contested as it once was, but a slight return to online normalcy in which mundane trips to the onsen have now become a source of fantasy for those at home. These days, it just hits harder.


  Still, the situation has also produced some more clever moments. The Go To Eat campaign hasn’t been quite as hyped up, though it has generated some love on YouTube and beyond. The biggest story to emerge online relating to the campaign was how users discovered a way to earn money by dining at yakitori chain Torikizoku by using a specific online reservation site and ordering the bare minimum … and then receiving coupons upon leaving to use on a return visit. Customers were basically able to make money by eating out.


  Torikizoku quickly changed its policy, but it was another reminder of life slowly returning to normal — people are always on the lookout for an attractive deal, but even a heavily discounted package won’t stop customers from trying to get the most out of the system.

"Years later, they would buy the property adjacent to Rocky Mountain National Park," they said. "The property become a lifelong mission to create 'heaven on earth' to which family, friends and strangers, who quickly became friends, would be drawn."
 The couple sold the property to their son Glenn in the spring of 2020, hoping to stay there "as long as physically possible," the family said.
 On October 21, the two called their son and shared that the blaze was burning in nearby fields, barns and homes but they remained calm and "resolute and adamant, they would not leave," the family said. When their son tried to call them back after getting in touch with his siblings, there was no answer.
 "Our family feels comforted in the knowledge our parents left this world together and on their own terms," the family said. "They leave a legacy of hard work and determination to overcome, something all in Grand County will need."
 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis addressed the loss on Twitter saying he was "extremely saddened' with the news.
 "My heart goes out to the family and friends of Lyle and Marilyn Hileman," the governor wrote.
 Authorities were just beginning to assess properties in the area, the sheriff said, and will continue over the coming days.
 "At this point we have no other missing persons on file from this incident," he said.
 The fire's cause remains under investigation and officials hope to have it contained by November 10.

FULTON - With a grant from Pathfinder Bank and the completed commercial kitchen checked off the renovation’s project list at CNY Arts Center, the multi-arts organization announces the launch of Arty’s Cookie Jar as part of the culinary arts programming.
 Featuring a menu of classic cookie favorites, the cookie shop will be open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Friday and from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on Saturdays. A $2,000 grant from Walmart Foundation provided start-up funds for inventory and supplies.
 “We have long awaited the completion of this beautiful teaching kitchen,” said Executive Director Nancy Fox, “and there are so many exciting ways to use it. From cooking classes to chef-inspired dinners, there is a lot of excitement about this new opportunity to increase our arts programming and also bring folks to the Arts Center.”
 The kitchen was always intended to be a source of earned income for the non- profit organization. “When the pandemic shut us down and took away our primary source of income, the theatre and live performing arts, we had to look for ways to diversify our revenue streams,” Fox continues. “Getting the kitchen finished was the first order and then we had to determine how to make money from it.”
 With live theatre unlikely to return to full capacity for the foreseeable future, the cookie shop will provide an alternate source of income to support the center while sharing the calendar with cooking classes and demonstrations, including Farm to Table events next summer in the plans.
 “We are hoping the community will support us by stopping in for a cookie, or a dozen. The grant from the Walmart Foundation was perfectly timed to help us cover those start-up expenses.”
 A grant from Pathfinder Bank made the kitchen renovation possible which includes a commercial 10 burner stove with state of the art fire-suppression system. A portion of the office next door was partitioned to make a large pantry allowing for ample storage.
 “We just couldn’t be more grateful and excited for the generous support of both these corporations who have stepped up to make this dream come true. The possibilities for culinary arts are endless and the community will benefit from having this new space available.”
 Arty's Cookie Jar, open 11 a.m.-7 p.m. Monday-Friday, 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on Saturdays, and extended hours during Arts Center events, is closed during cooking classes and culinary events such as Artycation. Kids cooking classes are held from 9 a.m.-noon Monday and Thursdays through Nov. 12. On those days, the cookie shop will open at noon. For more information, call 315-598-ARTS (2787). Website information will be added soon at www.CNYArtsCenter.com
 The CNY Community Arts Center is located at 121 Cayuga St. in downtown Fulton.

A ballot printing snafu in western Kansas has some asking questions that haven't been raised since the days of GOP Secretary of State Kris Kobach: How involved should local officials be in administering elections when they themselves are on the ballot?


   


  Election officials in Ellis County discovered 3,800 ballots that erroneously labeled the Kansas Senate District 40 race as being for the U.S. Senate. The mistake was discovered midday Friday and halted in-person advance voting for three days.


   


  In-person voting has resumed as of Thursday morning, Ellis County Clerk Donna Maskus said, and additional hours are being added to compensate for the lost days.


   


  "The mistake was made," Maskus said in an interview Friday. "I made it very clear what had happened and was apologetic but it was made and we have to go on. We are very cautious how we handle things and it was just one of those things that happened and we are dealing with it. Our community has been very genuine and understanding."


   


  Local Democrats are still up in arms, although a legal challenge is unlikely unless the margin of victory in the Kansas Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Billinger, R-Goodland, and Democrat Larry Dreiling is fewer than 3,800 votes.


   


  But a bigger issue still exists for some locals about potential conflicts of interest when election officials, or members of their staff, are on the ballot.


   


  Statewide, county clerks handle election administration duties except in the state's four most highly populated counties, Sedgwick, Johnson, Wyandotte and Shawnee, where they are appointed by the secretary of state. Often, the elections are uncontested and receive little fanfare.


   


  In Ellis County, Maskus is not running for reelection. But one of her deputies, Bobbi Dreiling, who is unrelated to Larry Dreiling, is on the ballot.


   


  She is being met with a write-in campaign from Laura Allen, a Hays resident affiliated with the local Democratic Party who said she was running in an effort to bring new blood to the role.


   


  The Ellis County clerk's race hasn't been contested since 2008, Allen said.


   


  "If we're having an election, people deserve a choice," she said. "It feels like our offices are handed down, even though they're not necessarily supposed to be. It is just the next person in line."


   


  In July, Allen requested that Bobbi Dreiling not be involved in the election administration process.


   


  In a reply, Markus brushed off the request and pledged the election administration will "continue doing our work per Kansas statute."


   


  She said Dreiling and other staff members wouldn't be on the board charged with handling and counting ballots.


   


  "We will conduct our office in a professional way as we always have been," Markus wrote. "The 2020 Elections will be extra busy and we look forward to that as we perform our duties in this office."


   


  She reiterated that sentiment Friday.


   


  "Every four years clerks are up for reelection," Maskus said. "I went through that, we all go through that. We still have a job to do."


   


  In Kansas, vote counting is handled by a local election board, although the state's election administration guidelines note that they will receive guidance from the clerk on some issues, such as pre-canvassing advance ballots.


   


  But Allen said the conservative nature of local politics in the county left her distrustful of the elections board as well.


   


  "I feel like the clerk and the election board should be completely bipartisan but I don't feel like that is the case in Ellis County," she said. "We're very, very red, we vote very Republican."


   


  Katie Koupal, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State's Office, said county clerks and their staff should "never be left alone with the ballots."


   


  Recusals, however, are generally not necessary, as she noted someone needs to be in charge of carrying out election duties.


   


  But Ellis County Democrats argue the printing issue should have been caught by Maskus and her team.


   


  They claim that their candidates and local party officials weren't provided a sample ballot as required under state law, something that they believe could have caught the error.


   


  Markus said she would "have to check" but was under the impression the sample ballots were distributed.


   


  "As I understood, it did go out and it is to go out," she said.


   


  Critics also point to issues stemming from a 2018 Kansas House race in which Democrats challenged the results on the grounds that the voting machines weren't properly calibrated. The lawsuit was later dropped.


   


  Still, John Bird, the attorney who filed the 2018 suit, said the situation was "intolerable" and raised the possibility of a lawsuit in 2020 as well.


   


  "It is a nightmare situation because of incompetence," Bird said.


   


  Similar questions have been raised about conflicts of interest nationally in recent years, including in Kansas.


   


  As votes were being counted in a razor-thin 2018 Republican primary for governor, then-Gov. Jeff Colyer requested that Secretary of State Kris Kobach recuse himself from the process.


   


  He argued that Kobach had been providing incorrect information to local election officials about which votes to count.


   


  "It has come to my attention that your office is giving advice to county election officials -- as recently as a conference call yesterday -- and you are making public statements on national television which are inconsistent with Kansas law and may serve to suppress the vote in the ongoing Kansas primary election process," Colyer wrote in a letter at the time.


   


  Kobach eventually did recuse himself and won the nomination by 361 votes, later losing to Gov. Laura Kelly in the general election.


   


  Kathleen Hale, a professor of political science at Auburn University and an expert on election administration, noted that ultimately voters serve as a check on election officials if their performance lags.


   


  A candidate with experience in an election office could be a boon, Hale said, and voters will be able to size up that record.


   


  "It is a job where professionalism and experience are extremely important and I think election officials across the country realize that," she said. "So to the extent where you have somebody as a candidate who has that kind of experience I think that would be a strong positive. If the public thinks the way the election office is being run is not a positive, then that's not a positive for an internal candidate."


   


  In Ellis County, Allen acknowledged the kerfuffle could actually help her make an effective case to voters.


   


  She said she didn't believe there would be any purposeful attempt by county election officials to undermine her but believed there was a risk that subconscious bias could kick in.


   


  "I don't want to make the assumption that anybody is going to do anything overtly unfair," Allen said. "We're human, and as humans we're biased to ourselves. And I also believe to a degree with her being a deputy clerk and working in that office for the last eight years there is a vested interest for everybody there."


   


  Hale said that, for the most part, any errors stem from the many balls election officials are forced to juggle.


   


  "It doesn't mean mistakes won't happen," she said. "It also doesn't mean every mistake is an inherently evil act."

Iris was a “stay at home” Mom…but with five daughters to raise, there was not a lot of staying at home. One of her stay at home activities included sewing all the clothes for her girls, herself, and a multitude of dolls…up to and including sewing wedding dresses for all five daughters. She also canned pickles, fruits and vegetables, kept a beautiful yard where she and Daddy served many “thank you steaks” for different organization volunteers, and once a week, she took time to pick basketfuls of daisies from the daisy bed she loved, to share with family and friends.
 In the midst of all this, she began volunteering in children’s activities, which benefitted many New Braunfels children, not just her own. She and Merritt taught Sunday School, Bible School and sponsored the Youth Fellowship at First Protestant Church. She was a Brownie and Girl Scout leader for each of her girls, ran the City-wide Summer Girl Scout Day Camp program, and served on the Lone Star Girl Scout Council in Austin. In the schools, she held every possible office in the Seele, NB Junior High School, High School and City Council PTA’s and “band-boosted” to the tune of sewing multiple uniforms for each of her five majorettes…all this while supporting her husband who was an avid community leader.
 When Daughter #5, Anne, went to Kindergarten, Iris continued her long-delayed education at Southwest Texas State University. She completed her degree and masters in history. Her thesis was based on the history of Comal County, and after graduation became a certified Texas and National Archivist. With Fred Oheim as her mentor, she was now ready to indulge her passion for historical preservation, fulfilling Mr. Oheim’s dream to establish an archive for New Braunfels. Iris, as a volunteer ran the Sophienburg Archives for almost 20 years, working with Herb Skoog to develop the Reflections Oral History Program, and served on the Historic Landmark Commission. Like so many other amazing museum volunteers, Iris helped preserve the written, oral and physical history of New Braunfels. These historical threads can now be used by anyone to weave their own personal family tapestry.
 Her many volunteer efforts did not go unnoticed. Iris received the NBISD Silver Unicorn, PTA Life Membership, and the Distinguished Alumni Awards. The New Braunfels Chamber of Commerce recognized her with the President’s Award for Historic Preservation, a place in Honor’s Hall, and ultimately the Besserung Award, often referred to as the outstanding Citizen’s Award. The Comal County Historical Commission presented Iris with the Frederick Frueholz, Jr., Historical Preservation Award, and The Braunfels Foundation honored her as a Living Legend.

Earlier this year, he was appointed chairman of GB Sport Media, a new digital broadcast platform owned by the UK governing bodies of the 28 summer Olympic sports.


  Mr Coles and TPG are understood to believe that there is substantial scope to improve the financial outlook of the EFL's member clubs, even amid the carnage wrought by the COVID-19 crisis.


  The EFL's three divisions range from the early-season Championship table- toppers Reading to Southend United, the bottom side in League Two.


  Many clubs have warned that they face going out of business without urgent financial support, a prospect made more likely by the possibility of a protracted period running well into next year of stadia without significant numbers of fans allowed.


  The government has pressed the Premier League to make a substantial financial contribution to the EFL, which some top-flight clubs have objected to on the basis that other industries affected by the pandemic have not been asked to fund similar bailouts of smaller competitors.


  English football has spent recent weeks in a state of chaos over the blueprint - dubbed Project Big Picture - orchestrated by Liverpool and Manchester United, which would have delivered £250m to the lower leagues.


  Their proposal would have seen the Premier League reduced from 20 to 18 clubs, and Sky News revealed this week that English football's biggest clubs have been holding talks about joining the European Premier League, a new continent-wide format that would have the backing of FIFA, the world governing body.


  JP Morgan, the Wall Street bank, is in talks about providing a $6bn (£4.6bn) debt package to support the new league's launch.


  While many EFL clubs welcomed Project Big Picture, it was rapidly abandoned amid political opposition and protests from elsewhere within the sport.


  The Premier League subsequently wrote to the EFL to offer a £50m grant to Leagues One and Two.


  TPG is not the only private capital provider examining plans to provide funding to the EFL.


  Other private equity firms have drawn up similar proposals, although some of those involve debt, rather than equity, funding.


  One football industry insider said the offer of £300m for a 20% stake in the EFL's commercial rights "significantly undervalued" them.


  TPG, which has invested in businesses such as the talent agency CAA and Goal.com, the football website, declined to comment on Saturday.

Alex Albon has two races in which to demonstrate he deserves to stay at Red Bull next year, team boss Christian Horner said on Saturday.


  Speaking ahead of qualifying at the Portuguese Grand Prix, Horner said the team wants the London-born Thai driver to prove they have no need to seek a replacement for 2021.


  The team plans to raise its challenge next year, the last with Honda as engine suppliers, to combat Mercedes more directly in the constructors’ and drivers’ championships.


  "He’s a popular member of the team, but we need two cars closer together in order to fight the Mercedes," said Horner. "That’s what we’ve got to do, that’s our target."


  Albon has struggled for consistency in his second year in Formula One with Red Bull after a mid-season switch from Toro Rosso last year, his rookie season.


  "We want Alex to claim that seat and basically justify that there is no need to look at any other alternative than Alex," added Horner. "I think everybody in the team wants to see him do that.


  "It felt like, in Mugello, he was starting to turn the corner and so on. He’s had a couple of difficult weekends, so he needs to bounce back here I think and particularly at Imola with a strong weekend from start to finish.


  "So that’s our focus, that’s our objective.”


  Albon has contributed 64 of the team’s total of 211 points this year with team-mate Max Verstappen dominating him in qualifying and race performances.


  Horner suggested that if the team felt his form this weekend and at next week’s Emilia Romagna Grand Prix was below par they would look beyond the Red Bull stable for a replacement.


  "Alpha Tauri are pretty settled with their drivers so, as I say, our preference is very much Alex, but if we had a look at a different solution, then obviously we would have to look outside of the Red Bull pool of drivers simply because there is not one available that we would look to put in.


  "There’s some quality drivers, obviously, on the market, that could be unemployed for next year."


  That list would include departing Racing Point driver Sergio Perez, his team’s 'super-sub' reserve driver Nico Hulkenberg and the two Haas men Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen who are departing the American outfit at the end of the year.

The government’s Go To Travel campaign prompted plenty of skepticism ahead of its debut in July. Understandably so — new cases of COVID-19 infections were back on the upswing at that time and the whole push to help support the country’s ailing tourism industry felt far too early. Initial results appeared to reflect people’s trepidation, with domestic tourists choosing by and large to refrain from traveling.


  While the program arguably hasn’t justified its ¥1.35 trillion budget, a look online suggests that attitudes toward the Go To Travel campaign — along with the recently launched Go To Eat effort — are shifting. Tokyo was finally included in the initiative from October and a growing number of people now appear to be taking advantage of it, with travel websites such as Rakuten and Jalan reporting that they were running out of slots.

El alcalde de Santa Marta, David Mingo, y el director de la Fundación Miguel Delibes, Fernando Zamácola, han inaugurado la nueva sala de exposiciones que llevará el nombre del escritor Miguel Delibes y que se ubicará en el Centro de Interpretación de la Isla del Soto. Este acto se encuentra enmarcado dentro de la celebración del Día de la Biblioteca que se conmemora este sábado.


  El alcalde ha indicado que “el Ayuntamiento continúa la línea de trabajo que comenzó la anterior legislatura donde destaca el creciente interés por la Cultura. Somos un municipio volcado con la cultura y el arte como motores de crecimiento y de atracción de turistas. La vecina Salamanca recibe muchos visitantes y este Ayuntamiento está trabajando para que parte de esos turistas pueda conocer también el atractivo de nuestra localidad que se recoge, entre otros aspectos, en nuestros museos a los que se une ahora este nuevo espacio expositivo. Una nueva sala a la que dará nombre un autor castellano, referente de nuestro tiempo, considerado uno de los grandes escritores españoles contemporáneos, gracias al cual diversas generaciones han conocido la riqueza del lenguaje y cuyo trabajo ha merecido numerosos galardones”.


  Por su parte, el director de la Fundación, Fernando Zamácola, se mostró “muy agradecido con el municipio por la iniciativa” y resaltó la importancia de que “el Año Delibes vaya más allá de un año, y esta sala cumple con esa idea”. En otro orden de cosas destacó la “apuesta decidida de este Consistorio por cultura y medio ambiente y que están también en consonancia con el espíritu de la fundación que dirige” y confirmó que espera “traer a la familia Delibes de la mano a conocer este espacio expositivo”.


  La nueva sala ocupa un lugar anexo al espacio expositivo principal y actualmente alberga la muestra titulada ‘Miguel Delibes y la Naturaleza’, que pretende ser un homenaje al escritor en el año de su centenario. Cuenta con paneles de gran formato con fotografías del escritor y textos extraídos de sus libros que reflejan su amor por la naturaleza y su preocupación por el medio ambiente.


  La naturaleza está presente en prácticamente toda la obra de Delibes y es muestra evidente de su compromiso ético en la defensa del medio ambiente. De ella se extrae también que el autor castellano fue un gran adelantado en su tiempo en la visión  de estos problemas que en la actualidad están tan presentes y preocupan tanto a todos los ciudadanos.


  Además de los paneles repartidos por toda la sala también se puede ver una muestra bibliográfica con los libros del escritor que de manera especial tratan la naturaleza. Todos ellos forman parte del fondo documental de la biblioteca municipal de Santa Marta de Tormes y con todo ello se invita a disfrutar de su lectura y profundizar en esta faceta fundamental en la trayectoria vital y literaria   del magnífico escritor que es Miguel Delibes. La exposición podrá verse en el Centro de Interpretación de la Isla del Soto hasta el 31 de diciembre.


  La Biblioteca municipal viene realizando distintas actividades para celebrar el centenario del nacimiento del escritor en el que ha denominado ‘Año Delibes’. Como recuerda el concejal de Cultura, Francisco Miguel García, “el escritor fue protagonista del Día del Libro a través de diferentes propuestas e invitaciones a los vecinos y centros escolares para participar de manera virtual durante el periodo de confinamiento. En la propia biblioteca hay también una muestra dedicada al escritor con la mayor parte de su obra a la que se han incorporado las últimas publicaciones dedicadas al escritor. Este acto lo hemos querido hacer coincidir con el Día de la Biblioteca porque nos parecía oportuno que se realizara una inauguración y una visita en la que nos acompañara el director de la Fundación Miguel Delibes”.


  Con todo ello el Ayuntamiento de Santa Marta de Tormes quiere rendir homenaje a este escritor castellano tan importante en nuestra literatura, que ha dejado un gran legado con plena vigencia en estos días.

  Franklin Street Fare, Grid's recently-opened world street food concept, will also hibernate for the time being.


  "We are seeing the same math as everyone else, and it does not make economic sense to remain open until the situation improves," Benacquista added in the statement.


  The hospitality group said Brew on the Grid, its artisan cafe, plans to stay open, since it is mostly takeout and delivery.


  According to Grid Hospitality Group, Worcester Beer Garden will suspend operations after service on Nov. 1. Franklin Street Fare will close after service on Oct. 31.

A ballot printing snafu in western Kansas has some asking questions that haven't been raised since the days of GOP Secretary of State Kris Kobach: How involved should local officials be in administering elections when they themselves are on the ballot?
   
 Election officials in Ellis County discovered 3,800 ballots that erroneously labeled the Kansas Senate District 40 race as being for the U.S. Senate. The mistake was discovered midday Friday and halted in-person advance voting for three days.
   
 In-person voting has resumed as of Thursday morning, Ellis County Clerk Donna Maskus said, and additional hours are being added to compensate for the lost days.
   
 "The mistake was made," Maskus said in an interview Friday. "I made it very clear what had happened and was apologetic but it was made and we have to go on. We are very cautious how we handle things and it was just one of those things that happened and we are dealing with it. Our community has been very genuine and understanding."
   
 Local Democrats are still up in arms, although a legal challenge is unlikely unless the margin of victory in the Kansas Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Billinger, R-Goodland, and Democrat Larry Dreiling is fewer than 3,800 votes.
   
 But a bigger issue still exists for some locals about potential conflicts of interest when election officials, or members of their staff, are on the ballot.
   
 Statewide, county clerks handle election administration duties except in the state's four most highly populated counties, Sedgwick, Johnson, Wyandotte and Shawnee, where they are appointed by the secretary of state. Often, the elections are uncontested and receive little fanfare.
   
 In Ellis County, Maskus is not running for reelection. But one of her deputies, Bobbi Dreiling, who is unrelated to Larry Dreiling, is on the ballot.
   
 She is being met with a write-in campaign from Laura Allen, a Hays resident affiliated with the local Democratic Party who said she was running in an effort to bring new blood to the role.
   
 The Ellis County clerk's race hasn't been contested since 2008, Allen said.
   
 "If we're having an election, people deserve a choice," she said. "It feels like our offices are handed down, even though they're not necessarily supposed to be. It is just the next person in line."
   
 In July, Allen requested that Bobbi Dreiling not be involved in the election administration process.
   
 In a reply, Markus brushed off the request and pledged the election administration will "continue doing our work per Kansas statute."
   
 She said Dreiling and other staff members wouldn't be on the board charged with handling and counting ballots.
   
 "We will conduct our office in a professional way as we always have been," Markus wrote. "The 2020 Elections will be extra busy and we look forward to that as we perform our duties in this office."
   
 She reiterated that sentiment Friday.
   
 "Every four years clerks are up for reelection," Maskus said. "I went through that, we all go through that. We still have a job to do."
   
 In Kansas, vote counting is handled by a local election board, although the state's election administration guidelines note that they will receive guidance from the clerk on some issues, such as pre-canvassing advance ballots.
   
 But Allen said the conservative nature of local politics in the county left her distrustful of the elections board as well.
   
 "I feel like the clerk and the election board should be completely bipartisan but I don't feel like that is the case in Ellis County," she said. "We're very, very red, we vote very Republican."
   
 Katie Koupal, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State's Office, said county clerks and their staff should "never be left alone with the ballots."
   
 Recusals, however, are generally not necessary, as she noted someone needs to be in charge of carrying out election duties.
   
 But Ellis County Democrats argue the printing issue should have been caught by Maskus and her team.
   
 They claim that their candidates and local party officials weren't provided a sample ballot as required under state law, something that they believe could have caught the error.
   
 Markus said she would "have to check" but was under the impression the sample ballots were distributed.
   
 "As I understood, it did go out and it is to go out," she said.
   
 Critics also point to issues stemming from a 2018 Kansas House race in which Democrats challenged the results on the grounds that the voting machines weren't properly calibrated. The lawsuit was later dropped.
   
 Still, John Bird, the attorney who filed the 2018 suit, said the situation was "intolerable" and raised the possibility of a lawsuit in 2020 as well.
   
 "It is a nightmare situation because of incompetence," Bird said.
   
 Similar questions have been raised about conflicts of interest nationally in recent years, including in Kansas.
   
 As votes were being counted in a razor-thin 2018 Republican primary for governor, then-Gov. Jeff Colyer requested that Secretary of State Kris Kobach recuse himself from the process.
   
 He argued that Kobach had been providing incorrect information to local election officials about which votes to count.
   
 "It has come to my attention that your office is giving advice to county election officials -- as recently as a conference call yesterday -- and you are making public statements on national television which are inconsistent with Kansas law and may serve to suppress the vote in the ongoing Kansas primary election process," Colyer wrote in a letter at the time.
   
 Kobach eventually did recuse himself and won the nomination by 361 votes, later losing to Gov. Laura Kelly in the general election.
   
 Kathleen Hale, a professor of political science at Auburn University and an expert on election administration, noted that ultimately voters serve as a check on election officials if their performance lags.
   
 A candidate with experience in an election office could be a boon, Hale said, and voters will be able to size up that record.
   
 "It is a job where professionalism and experience are extremely important and I think election officials across the country realize that," she said. "So to the extent where you have somebody as a candidate who has that kind of experience I think that would be a strong positive. If the public thinks the way the election office is being run is not a positive, then that's not a positive for an internal candidate."
   
 In Ellis County, Allen acknowledged the kerfuffle could actually help her make an effective case to voters.
   
 She said she didn't believe there would be any purposeful attempt by county election officials to undermine her but believed there was a risk that subconscious bias could kick in.
   
 "I don't want to make the assumption that anybody is going to do anything overtly unfair," Allen said. "We're human, and as humans we're biased to ourselves. And I also believe to a degree with her being a deputy clerk and working in that office for the last eight years there is a vested interest for everybody there."
   
 Hale said that, for the most part, any errors stem from the many balls election officials are forced to juggle.
   
 "It doesn't mean mistakes won't happen," she said. "It also doesn't mean every mistake is an inherently evil act."

Un dibattito cruciale ai fini delle sorti dell’elezione non è evidentemente il luogo migliore per spiegare le ragioni che consiglierebbero all’America di stabilire buone relazioni con il Cremlino, trattandosi di una posizione controversa che sottrae più voti di quanti possa aggiungerne. Non è quindi stupefacente che Biden e Trump abbiano cercato entrambi di rafforzare le proprie credenziali anti-russe davanti a chi li ascoltava per decidere chi votare fra i due il prossimo 3 novembre. Sono motivi analoghi, del resto, ad aver suggerito a Trump di far precedere qualsiasi tentativo di avvicinamento a Putin da mosse aggressive ad alto impatto mediatico – ad esempio, in Siria - che avevano soprattutto lo scopo di non mostrarlo debole nei confronti della Russia.      La situazione elettorale di Trump resta tuttora incerta e precaria, data la forza anche finanziaria dello schieramento che si è aggregato contro di lui. Ma lo è forse meno dopo il duello televisivo del 22 ottobre. Quanto si è visto, malgrado tutto, ha infatti consolidato la sensazione che il Presidente uscente sia di gran lunga quanto di meglio gli Stati Uniti possano offrire in questo momento al resto del pianeta.
