"We won't leave until Bibi leaves." Israel's struggle to contain the coronavirus has stirred deep-seated resentment towards Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and protests demanding his resignation are growing by the week.
 As the Shabbat rest-day was ending on Saturday evening, thousands of demonstrators headed towards Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence, a main site for protests that have taken place in multiple cities.
 Some demonstrators branded Netanyahu -- who has been indicted with bribery, fraud and breach of trust -- as corrupt, while others condemned a lack of coherence in the government's response to the pandemic.
 For Tamir Gay-Tsabary, who travels each day to the Jerusalem protests with his wife Tami from southern Israel, coronavirus was "a trigger" that brought renewed focus to Netanyahu's leadership faults.
 The pandemic made people "understand that he doesn't care (about) Israel, he just cares for himself," the 56-year-old sales manager told AFP.
 Netanyahu won praise for his initial response to the virus.
 His government's quick decisions in March to curb travel and impose a lockdown brought the daily case-count to a trickle by early May.
 But an economic re-opening that began in late April has led to an explosion in transmission in the country of about 9 million people, with daily COVID-19 tallies ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 cases in recent weeks.
 Anti-government protests that initially included a few hundred people in Tel Aviv, now regularly count several thousand there and in Jerusalem.
 Reflecting on the movement, Einav Schiff of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said it began in response to "a premature victory celebration for having defeated the coronavirus".
 That false victory "morphed into a healthcare and economic failure, which has left a severe crisis of confidence between the public and the government in its wake," he said.

The culture within Surry County Schools is based on a covenant we make to all of our students and families, our promise to all. We promise to provide a high-quality education for achievement, leadership, and life. Over the past few months, I have been honored to explain exactly what that means, and the pandemic has brought to light many of the things educators do on a daily basis behind the scenes. Now, more than ever, the public is able to see shining examples of our love and care for students and families more personally. Our response has included an emphasis on utilizing our technological resources to remain connected with our families. Technology has been invaluable to us to be able to see our students and one another as our district, schools, and teachers plan for the future.

In North Carolina's attempt to stay ahead of the curve, Gov. Roy Cooper announced a three-phase plan to re-open our state from COVID-19 closures. Policies were enacted quickly when the COVID-19 pandemic began in order to save lives and avoid overwhelming our hospital systems. While our state has successfully slowed the rate of acceleration of COVID-19, the phased re- opening allows public health officials to observe various metrics, such as testing capacity, when considering how to safely transition back to a more normal way of life.

There is a point in one's life where you live long enough to become an expert in something. Expertise can be in almost any subject under the sun. You might be a self-described expert in golf, fishing, guitars, baking bread, sculpture and the list goes on. Honestly, I count myself an expert in a handful of subjects (don't we all!) but I won't bore you with the details. The question is what qualifies someone to be an expert? When questions like this come up, I turn to the Websters Dictionary (merriam-webster.com) They define an expert as "one with special skill or knowledge representing mastery of a particular subject."

On March 18, Washington County Schools shut down at the urging of Gov. Bill Lee. The coronavirus had made its way into Tennessee. Had the governor not issued his recommendation, most if not all of the state’s 147 public school systems would have likely shut down anyway. The public pressure had become enormous.
 Washington County Schools immediately set three priorities for the period of school closure. First, we wanted to make sure our students received the nutrition they needed. A significant percentage of our enrollment depends on the free and reduced meal program and we felt that this should be addressed immediately.
 Two days after school closed we opened four school kitchens to serve as distribution points for drive-by pickup. Early the next week we had opened four additional pickup sites and by the end of that week we were providing front door delivery to over 100 Washington County families using big yellow school buses as delivery vehicles. The people staffing those delivery buses were regular Washington County bus drivers and volunteer teachers and school administrators. At the height of the program we were serving just over 4,000 meals per day.
 Our second priority was to keep our students engaged in their learning. Our incredible group of professional educators immediately ramped up an online and distance learning program. Teachers reached out to students by all means available, working hard to keep students motivated and active. Our instructional coaches developed hard-copy learning packets for students that lacked internet access at home.
 We expected that many children would not have internet access, but we were surprised to learn that of those families that did have internet service, many could only access it through their smart phones. A three-inch phone screen doesn’t lend itself well to school work, so we issued some 500 laptop computers to families so that their children would have the technology they needed.
 Our third priority was to take care of our people. Washington County Schools has some 1,200 employees. State law provides that licensed educators will continue to be paid their full salary during a time of emergency closure, but that’s only about half of the people that keep our schools operating. Clerks, cooks, drivers, certain supervisory staff, mechanics, maintenance workers, IT staff, and all the other dedicated individuals that work diligently to support what goes on in our classrooms were suddenly sidelined.
 The Washington County Board of Education took action at the board meeting following the closure to make sure not a single employee missed a paycheck. As the school closure continued we were able to bring many of our support personnel back into service. Our building and grounds had to be maintained and cleaned, our transportation fleet maintained, our computer network and other technology needed constant support, and of course we had to continue to pay the bills. We came to understand that the services provided by many of our people are essential and ongoing whether students are in class or not.
 When it became apparent that we were not going to return to school at any point during the 2019-20 school year, our attention turned to the ensuing year. Our school calendar was already in place: opening day would be Aug. 3. By then, our students would have been out of class some 138 days. That’s a particularly long time for our youngest students who are just learning to read.
 We set about creating a multi-tiered school reopening plan. First, we needed an overall protocol for reopening that took into account the uncertainty of the virus itself. This protocol, released to the public in June, outlined three approaches. If the COVID-19 infection rate was at a minimal level, we would have a full reopening with all students and all teachers present. A moderate to high infection rate would activate a plan in which only a percentage of our students would be in class at any one time. Our school faculties would be present five days a week. If the infection rate went higher, we put together a plan to have all students attend school virtually.
 We knew that some students would be unable to attend school under any circumstances, so we adopted a plan by which any student could begin the school year virtually simply by signing up for those services. All of these protocols were developed in coordination with state and local health authorities.
 While the overall plan was being developed, various task forces within the system were organized. Teachers, school administrators, and various other professional staff members put together a fine-tuned plan for curriculum delivery and safety protocols within the schools. Our technology department ordered enough equipment so that our school system will have enough laptop computers for every student this year. Our maintenance and custodial departments have been planning for an elevated sanitation protocol. In short, every department has a plan in place for whatever we may be facing in August.
 While this work was going on locally, the Tennessee State Board of Education adopted policies and guidelines for school systems to follow in the likelihood of a COVID-related schedule alteration. These guidelines are quite complex, but the bottom line is that the State Board expects every Tennessee public school system to provide 180 days of standards-based instruction to every Tennessee student this year. Another shutdown, such as we experienced in the spring of 2020, isn’t likely to happen. School may look vastly different this year than in the past, but we’re going to have school.
 Every citizen has a stake in what goes on this academic year. It is preferable that we have our students in school, operating as usual. This will only happen if we all do that things we should; wear those masks, wash those hands, observe social distancing, and do all the others things that will help our community and our nation overcome this pandemic.

My concern now is how we communicate with each other. Back in the old days, if a salesperson needed to contact a prospective buyer, they might send a letter. After the letter arrived, the salesperson would call the prospect and maybe a set up a face to face meeting. The meeting would take place and hopefully the sale was completed. Today that entire process has been changed by technology. There are so many ways to contact someone that do not involve a telephone. Need to contact your boss, email them. Maybe you need to reach out to a friend, you can text a message to them. If you are on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (or the many other choices in social media), you can send a message. During the current pandemic, the use of video conferencing has become a popular way to hold a meeting. This got me thinking, does anyone just pick up the phone and call people anymore?

“Not everybody is a professional ornithologist,” said Kim Stroud, who is president of the local chapter. “For a lot of people, this is their hobby. They like being out in nature. They are constantly learning new things. It keeps their minds sharp, and there is a lot of camaraderie within the group.”
 Folks have been tracking the habits of birds, both native and passers by, for the past 70 years. The Lee and Lois Herndon Chapter started in 1944, and is based in Elizabethton and Carter County. There are also chapters in Kingsport and Bristol.
 Members spend time counting different types of birds in the area, but also take on deeper endeavors. For example, the chapter is currently helping with a William & Mary University bird study.
 The chapter has members like Fred Alsop, who is a professor of ornithology at East Tennessee State University, and Rick Knight, who is a professional ornithologist.
 The group does several bird counts throughout a typical year — of which 2020 is not because of the pandemic.
 “Under normal circumstances we try to do one field trip a month to local areas,” said Stroud. “But we haven’t been meeting as much because of COVID.”
 Generally, there are two counts during the Christmas season, one in Elizabethton and one in Roan Mountain.
 “We try to identify birds by sight or sound,” said Stroud, who has a day job as an instructional lab assistant at Northeast State Community College. “A lot of birds you expect to see, but occasionally you get something unique.”
 In the spring and fall, the group does counts in Carter, Washington, Unicoi, Sullivan and Johnson counties.
 “We are looking at which birds are residents and which birds are migrating through,” Stroud said.
 In the summer, the counts take place in Unicoi and Carter counties. Sometimes the counts are done on foot, and sometimes the participants take a drive.
 “We drive around and listen,” Stroud said. “We drive slowly along the backroads, seeing what we can hear.”
 Stroud said the group is open to the public and anyone can become a member.
 “We are usually involved in the Roan Mountain Naturalist Rally, and anybody can join those walks in the spring and fall. This year, they will have to pre- register for the fall walk.”

At his 1958 meeting with King, the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and civil rights lawyer Fred Gray, Lewis talked about the possibility of a lawsuit to try to integrate the university at Troy, Gray recently recalled. The lawsuit ultimately did not happen because of concerns about retaliation his parents would face in the majority-white county.
 "Even before he met Dr. King, he was interested in doing something about doing away with segregation. And he did it all his life," Gray told The Associated Press.
 Lewis was one of 10 children born into a sharecropping family. His parents saved enough money to buy their own farm where the Lewis children worked the fields and tended the animals. A young Lewis was less fond of field work — often grousing about the grueling task — but eagerly took on the job of tending the chickens while practicing preaching.
 In his autobiography, "Walking with the Wind," Lewis described how as a youngster he longed to go the county's public library but wasn't allowed because it was for whites only.
 "Even an eight-year-old could see there was something terribly wrong about that," Lewis wrote.
 He would eventually apply for a library card there, knowing he would be refused, in what he considered his first official act of resistance to racial apartheid.
 In 1955, he heard a new voice on the radio: King, who was leading the Montgomery bus boycott about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away.
 Lewis became a leader of the Freedom Riders, often facing violent and angry crowds, and was jailed dozens of times. In 1961, he was beaten after arriving at the same Montgomery station where he arrived three years earlier to meet King. In 1965, his skull was fractured on the bridge in Selma when law enforcement officers beat civil rights marchers in a melee became known as Bloody Sunday.
 President Barack Obama in 2011 awarded Lewis the Presidential Medal of Freedom saying he was "an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time."
 Last year, Lewis announced he had been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer.
 His sister Rosa Tyner told The Associated Press that about a week before his death she asked him about possibly seeing another doctor, but that he declined. "He said, 'No, I'm at peace. I'm at peace and I'm ready to go,'" she said.
 His sister Ethel Mae Tyner said Saturday that, "this not a goodbye. It's just a different kind of hello.
 "Rest well, Robert. Rest well."

Speaking of higher cap rates, GMRE has recently acquired four properties in the first quarter for a cap rate of 8.3%. Since the first quarter, another property was acquired for a cap rate of 8.8%. That very high cap rate was presumably due to their assumption of the mortgage loan associated with the property (4.62%, four years). There are three more pending acquisitions in the works, but we will see if those actually go through or not. It would not be the worst thing in the world to save a little more cash at this time.
 I'm encouraged that the company has been able to scoop up attractive deals in this uncertain period, rather than "chasing safety" and low cap rates like the other MOB REITs. Additionally, I like the 2.1% average annual contractual rent increases for their properties. Having an internal method of growth puts less pressure on the company to hit it out of the park with every acquisition. According to the company, their portfolio tenant rent coverage as a whole averages at 4.8x which is predictably less than the other MOB REITs but still miles above nursing home and SNF facilities and even a good deal above MPW's hospitals. 4.8x rent coverage makes me confident that the annual rent escalators will actually take place. If you had a significant amount of your portfolio full of tenants with 1.0x or less coverage, like Ventas, I don't really care what you claim rent will be next year, it's less certain that you'll actually receive all of it like you planned.
 I had been holding off on GMRE not due to its business model, but due to its high leverage and pending internalization deal. I have been burned a little in the past by jumping into attractive REITs pre-internalization and then being given a haircut as the dilution drags on the short term share price and/or dividend. Impressively, GMRE internalized at very attractive rates, buying out the manager for just $18.1 million, which is 2.5x the TTM manager fee. A typical price for internalization is about 3x management fees.

Bloomberg) -- The U.S. economy is still set for a third-quarter recovery, and the impact of the virus surge in Sun Belt states on crimping growth will be limited, top Trump administration officials said.
 “I don’t deny that some of these hot-spot states are going to moderate that recovery, but on the whole the picture is very positive and I still think the V-shaped recovery is in place,” White House economic director Larry Kudlow said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
 “And I still think it’s going to be 20% growth rate in the third and fourth quarters,” he added.
 Kudlow, who also said he expects a federal moratorium on renter evictions to be extended, aligned with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who told Fox News he expects a major rebound after an historic slump in the quarter that ended June 30.
 “We always have the second quarter was going to be a very bad quarter. Again, that’s not for economic reasons. That’s for health reasons. We literally shut down the entire economy,” Mnuchin said. “The third quarter, the consensus is 17% GDP [growth], so we do think you’re going to see a very big rebound.”
 The comments contrast with warning signs that the pandemic recovery could be faltering as Covid-19 cases surge and the U.S. death toll exceeded 1,000 on four days last week.
 Meanwhile, lawmakers are debating of another round of stimulus spending with Republicans in disagreement with Democrats and among themselves over details of what it should cover.
 Mnuchin said President Donald Trump’s administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page on the Republican-proposed $1 trillion package. One focus cited by Mnuchin and Kudlow is to limit wage replacement to 70%, which proponents view as an added incentive for people to return to work.
 Though massive unemployment appeared to have leveled off, U.S. weekly jobless claims rose for the first time since March in the latest report, the clearest sign yet of a pause in the economic recovery. Consumer sentiment further soured in July. A 1.2% drop in the S&P 500 on Thursday was the index’s biggest decline in almost a month.
 Residential real estate has been a bright spot, with home sales hitting an almost 13-year high amid record-low borrowing costs.
 Kudlow said the virus surge in the populous states of Florida, Texas and California will lead to “a moderation of this recovery -- no question.” Yet other indicators, such as housing, retail sales and auto sales, paint a brighter picture, he said.
 “First of all, I don’t think the economy is going south -- I think it’s going north,” said Kudlow. “There are some key states, yes, California and Texas and Florida that are having hot-spot difficulties right now, but it’s nothing like it was last winter.”
 “The states are in charge of” containing the virus, he said. “Each state has a different story. Most of the states are doing rather well in this.”
