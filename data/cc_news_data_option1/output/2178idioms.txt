After a few days of not speaking, the accused spoke to the defendant and asked that she meet him at his home. At the end of January 2020 she came to his house at night where the accused offered her an alcoholic beverage.
 According to the defendant, the accused raped her at his home while she continued to ask him to stop.
 "The IDF views all sexual harm as a grave offense, especially where an IDF officer exploits his authority to commit the harm," the IDF Spokesperson's Unit said, adding that "the IDF will continue to act to eradicate such phenomena and will make sure that anyone who goes against it is prosecuted in an appropriate manner."
 The trial is ongoing at the Jaffa Military Court.
 Less than two weeks ago, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi relieved one officer of duty and formally censured four others for their role in the suicide of a Givati soldier, Cpl. Niv Lubaton, who was being recruited by Military Police as an informant.
 Following the investigation into Lubaton's death, the then-commander of the Military Police Investigatory Unit's Beersheba station was removed from the unit. The officer, who held the rank of Major, will also not serve in positions of command and he will not be able to be promoted for six years in light of his responsibility for the incident.
 The investigation into the January 2018 suicide of Lubaton, took place over the course of several months, after Kochavi ordered a full investigation into his suicide and the methods used by the Military Police Investigatory Unit (Metzach) for recruiting informants.
 "This is an unbelievably painful and saddening incident and we must do everything to prevent such an event from recurring," Kochavi said. "Intelligence gathering, interrogations and the like must be carried out with sensitivity and concern for the soldier. The Military Police Investigatory Unit must learn lessons and implement them immediately."
 The military said that Kochavi also ordered a series of systematic measures for the Military Police Investigatory Unit as well as in the military, including reviewing and updating its methods of recruiting informants.
 In December, Israeli Police arrested a 19-year-old from Rishon Lezion on suspicion of committing sex offenses, including the rape of a 12-year-old girl from the North, whom he met online. The accused served as a soldier in the Military Police Criminal Investigations Division.

Cook's public letter is similar to a memo he sent to employees earlier this week. In the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg, Cook said Apple will match employee donations to organizations the support racial equality two-for-one throughout the month of June.
 The letter comes just a few days after tech venture capitalist Vinod Khosla urged Cook to speak up publicly about Apple's values in light of the protests, particularly given Cook's seemingly cordial relationship with President Donald Trump, who appeared to call for violence against the demonstrators last week.
 "It's easy to support equality & justice for all decent folks," Khosla tweeted on Monday. "It's when one has to give up something to support it that belief in our real values show up. @tim_cook easy to talk but why do you suck up to @realDonaldTrump? Memo's to employees is easy. Please retweet."
 Khosla told Recode that Cook should be willing to support his words with "actions that might cost them something." Khosla said he'd love Cook to "comment on Trump's racist rants" and that Cook "cozied up to Trump to get tariff relief."

While our laws have changed, the reality is that their protections are still not universally applied. We've seen progress since the America I grew up in, but it is similarly true that communities of color continue to endure discrimination and trauma.
 I have heard from so many that you feel afraid -- afraid in your communities, afraid in your daily lives, and, most cruelly of all, afraid in your own skin. We can have no society worth celebrating unless we can guarantee freedom from fear for every person who gives this country their love, labor, and life.
 At Apple, our mission has been and always will be to create technology that empowers people to change the world for the better. We've always drawn strength from diversity, welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world, and strived to build an Apple that is inclusive of everyone.
 But we must do more. We commit to continuing our work to bring critical resources and technology to underserved school systems. We commit to continuing to fight the forces of environmental injustice -- like climate change -- which disproportionately harm Black communities and other communities of color. We commit to looking inward and pushing progress forward on inclusion and diversity, so that every great idea can be heard. And we're donating to organizations including the Equal Justice Initiative, which challenge racial injustice and mass incarceration.

To create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored. Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines. To the Black community -- we see you. You matter and your lives matter.
 This is a moment when many people may want nothing more than a return to normalcy, or to a status quo that is only comfortable if we avert our gaze from injustice. As difficult as it may be to admit, that desire is itself a sign of privilege. George Floyd's death is shocking and tragic proof that we must aim far higher than a "normal" future, and build one that lives up to the highest ideals of equality and justice.
 In the words of Martin Luther King, "Every society has its protectors of status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. Today, our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change."
 With every breath we take, we must commit to being that change, and to creating a better, more just world for everyone.

We’re tired of shouldering the burden of dragging this 200-year-old institution kicking and screaming into a more equitable age. We’re tired of being told of the progress the company has made and being served platitudes about “diversity and inclusion” when we raise our concerns. We’re tired of seeing our words and photos twisted to fit a narrative that does not reflect our reality. We’re tired of being told to show both sides of issues there are no two sides of.

Io sono stato fortunato.

Questa, per me, e la cosa piu orribile», prosegue Carlo che si dice «determinato a trovare una soluzione per evitare che altre persone siano colpite». Quale? «Mettere la natura al centro delle nostre economie», spiega il principe 71enne che da anni e impegnato per la causa ambientalista. Se non impariamo dalla pandemia, e il messaggio del primogenito della regina Elisabetta, potremmo trovarci di fronte ad un'altra minaccia del genere in futuro.

The Load 75, which costs from €6,400 (tested model costs €8,500) is the top range bike and comes with all the bells and whistles. It is equipped with two 500Wh Bosch batteries taking the range to a an impressive 100km. It has a triple suspension, adjustable modular child seats, 3d moulded seat (you’ll feel the love), a large box for storing anything including two to three children, carbon belt drive system (goodbye greasy chains), a super-bright spotlight and an outer skeleton safety rims that keep the precious cargo safe from heavy collision rather than a typical carbon fibre box found in most cargo bikes. The maximum speed of The Load 75 is 48kmph! That’s 50cc scooter territory. But unlike a scooter, Load 75 is surprisingly nimble and swift around the corners, and is a treat to ride.

We all tend to think of the same few brands when someone brings up canvas sneakers: Vans, Keds and Converse. They are three of our faves, for sure, and have been for a long time. We’re not going to lie though — sometimes they are a little out of our price range. The thing about these lightweight canvas sneakers is that we want to stock up on a bunch of colors to go with all of our outfits, but when they’re $50+ each, that plan becomes a no-go. That’s why we were almost too excited to find Forever Link!
