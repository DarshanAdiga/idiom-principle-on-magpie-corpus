Canadas decision to withdraw from the Tokyo Olympic Games if they were to be held in 2020 was a unilateral decision based on the health and safety of athletes and with no consultation with the International Olympic Committee, the COC said on Friday.The Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee had said on Sunday they would not be sending athletes to Tokyo in July if the IOC decided to go ahead with the plans to stage Games this year amid the coronavirus outbreak. While we are, and have been, in constant communication with the IOC, our decision last Sunday evening to not send athletes to Tokyo this summer because of COVID-19 concerns was taken solely by the Canadian Olympic Committee without the participation of the IOC, COC spokesperson Photi Sotiropoulos told Reuters in a telephone call.The decision was taken in consultation with our athletes commission, our Chief Medical Officer and the Canadian sport community. We met with our athletes commission... twice before making our decision with the full support of over 100 members of our sport community and the Canadian Olympic Board, Sotiropoulos added.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau backed the COC decision, urging other countries to do the same. Canada is among the bigger national Olympic committees and the country is one of only a handful to have hosted both summer and winter Olympics. Australia, another Olympic powerhouse, followed suit hours later, piling more pressure on Games organisers and the IOC to postpone the Olympics.This also prompted some suggestions that the IOC may have planned this in a way to create leverage through the double withdrawal threat, allowing the Olympic body to finally postpone the Games. That did not happen. This decision was not part of a plan by the IOC to create leverage for a postponement of Games, Sotiropoulos said.We made this difficult decision independently of the IOC. We were surprised and pleased when Australia took a very similar position within hours of our own. The IOC on Tuesday finally postponed the Olympics by a year after also coming under intense pressure from thousands of athletes, whose preparations had been disrupted by the spread of the virus.The Olympics have never before been delayed, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars, and major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984, respectively.

NASCAR had promised a shakeup of its staid schedule in 2021, but the crisis may force the stock car series to offer a sneak peak the rest of the summer. Mid-week races, night races, doubleheaders, nothing is off the starting grid when it comes to potential scenarios to squeeze in the remaining 32 Cup races. NASCAR offered a break with tradition in June with Pocono Raceway set to hold a NASCAR Cup Series twin bill, with one race on Saturday, one on Sunday. The test run for '21 could now be forced on at least another track -- with Dover the top target -- before this season is over.

The number of isolation beds has been increased to 290 at the government hospital in Gandhinagar here to treat COVID-19 patients, an official said on Friday. Preparations are underway to set up additional isolation rooms and wards, and intensive care unit beds, Financial Commissioner, Health and Medical Education Department, Atal Dulloo said. Four more persons, two with travel history to abroad, have tested positive for the coronavirus in the Union Territory, taking the total number of cases to 18. The newly constructed block of the Gandhinagar hospital will have a capacity of 200 isolation beds. This is in addition to the 90 isolation beds at the hospital, Dulloo said. Dulloo was at the hospital to take stock of works in the new block that is being converted entirely to treat COVID-19 patients.The 200-bed newly constructed block will be made functional within a couple of days, Dulloo said. The decision for dedicating the Gandhinagar hospital and other associated hospitals of the Government Medical College, Jammu, for treating COVID-19 cases was taken during a recent meeting to augment isolation facilities, he said. The government has also ordered suspension of non-urgent operations and other treatments to free up capacity to deal with COVID-19 cases. We have decided to dedicate the Gandhinagar hospital, chest diseases hospital and psychiatry hospital in Jammu entirely for COVID-19 patients. However, we have to ensure that our critical care services in other hospitals must not suffer, Dulloo said. He said that other operations of these hospitals have to be reduced in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

Overall, it appears that the importance of in-vehicle software is becoming more and more evident among Germany’s automakers, and it seems that Volkswagen would do what it can to make sure that it can at least reduce the lead currently enjoyed by Tesla. The American electric car maker had shunned existing supply chains when it was developing its electric cars’ software, developing its in-vehicle systems from scratch. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla’s software runs on a central control unit, giving it a much more efficient structure that is optimized for software updates and maintenance.

Just like the Fitbit Charge 3, the Charge 4 is expected to come in standard and "Special" editions, the latter of which will add NFC to the equation for wrist payment support on the company's proprietary platform. If you like listening to music while working out, you should be happy to hear both the Fitbit Charge 4 and Charge 4 Special Edition will let you stream your favorite Spotify content... as long as you sync your wearable to your phone via Bluetooth.
   
 The already impressive set of Charge 3 activity tracking tools will apparently be further expanded and improved with features like "active zones" and more precise information about different types of workouts, while the battery life should remain largely unchanged, at up to seven days between charges, although standalone GPS use will obviously drastically reduce that number.
   
 Despite these pretty important upgrades and enhancements, the Fitbit Charge 4 is tipped to start at the same $150 price as its predecessor. Of course, nothing's etched in stone until the company comes out with an official announcement, so let's try to contain our excitement for the time being.

The African Development Bank AAA has raised an exceptional 3 billion in a three-year bond to help alleviate the economic and social impact the Covid-19 pandemic will have on livelihoods and Africas economies. The Fight Covid-19 Social bond, with a three-year maturity, garnered interest from central banks and official institutions, bank treasuries, and asset managers including Socially Responsible Investors, with bids exceeding 4.6 billion. This is the largest Social Bond ever launched in international capital markets to date, and the largest US Dollar benchmark ever issued by the Bank. It will pay an interest rate of 0.75.The African Development Bank Group is moving to provide flexible responses aimed at lessening the severe economic and social impact of this pandemic on its regional member countries and Africas private sector.These are critical times for Africa as it addresses the challenges resulting from the Coronavirus. The African Development Bank is taking bold measures to support African countries. This 3 billion Covid-19 bond issuance is the first part of our comprehensive response that will soon be announced. This is indeed the largest social bond transaction to date in capital markets. We are here for Africa, and we will provide significant rapid support for countries, said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank Group.The order book for this record-breaking bond highlights the scale of investor support, which the African Development Bank enjoys, said the arrangers.As the Covid-19 outbreak is dangerously threatening Africa, the African Development Bank lives up to its huge responsibilities and deploys funds to assist and prepare the African population, through the financing of access to health and to all other essential goods, services, and infrastructure, said Tanguy Claquin, Head of Sustainable Banking, Crdit Agricole CIB.Coronavirus cases were slow to arrive in Africa, but the virus is spreading quickly and has infected nearly 3,000 people across 45 countries, placing strain on already fragile health systems. It is estimated that the continent will require many billions of dollars to cushion the impact of the disease as many countries scrambled contingency measures, including commercial lockdowns in desperate efforts to contain it. Globally, factories have been closed and workers sent home, disrupting supply chains, trade, travel, and driving many economies toward recession. Commenting on the landmark transaction, George Sager, Executive Director, SSA Syndicate, Goldman Sachs said In a time of unprecedented market volatility, the African Development Bank has been able to brave the capital markets in order to secure invaluable funding to help the efforts of the Africancontinents fight against Covid-19.

IF there is a day that former Zimbabwe, Kaizer Chiefs and Blackpool striker Liberty Masunda would like to forget in a hurry, then July 17, 2018 comes to his mind.   Masunda, sat in the dock together with 11 others who included journalist Clemence Marijeni, facing charges of defrauding the Department of Works and Pensions £450, 000 in maternity payments in the United Kingdom.   Masunda, who was 43 years old then, sat in shock as the judge sentenced him to three years in jail for the crime that he still professes his innocence up to today.   Now out of prison after serving just a year of the sentence, Masunda can only shake his head in sorrow as he reminisces about the ordeal.   “When the judge pronounced the three-year sentence, I was shocked because I did not commit the crime. Even some of the co-accused did not know me and I did not know them save for Marijeni whom I had worked with in a shipping company.   “The judge ruled that since I since I knew him, I must also have known that he was involved in illegal activities. They used circumstantial evidence.   “This was in-spite of the fact that Marijeni told the judge that I was not involved. After being offered a suspended sentence for a guilty plea which I refused, I ended up in prison for inferences which had nothing to do with the evidence at hand,” he said.   “I was just unfortunate to have been a business partner with Marijeni. In 2012, I bought two cars which I tried to ship to Zimbabwe but the person I paid to do the job did not deliver.   “That’s when I and Marijeni formed a shipping company which we named Three Ways. Marijeni asked for my utility bills which he used to register the company.   “I didn’t know that he was involved in other businesses. In 2013 the police confiscated my computers but found nothing criminal.   “I was convicted even though Marijeni told the judges that I knew nothing about the case. They even offered me a suspended sentence if I plead guilty, something that I could not do because I was innocent,” he said.   The former Blackpool striker, who is a qualified Clinical Engineer, drew priceless lessons from the experience.   “We live life differently and the whole purpose of playing football was to have a good life with family. I have educated myself as much as possible and am looking to start my MBA in Healthcare this year.   “The sky is the limit. The Almighty gives everyone a second chance, that’s why Christ died on the cross for our sins. My advice to people is please do not go into ventures with someone you do not know much about,” he said.   Speaking of his time in prison, Masunda said; “I taught English and Maths in Prison. During the first days we were made to write English and Maths tests and I got 100% in both exams. I was trained as a City and Guilts Level Two Teaching Assistant and would have 12 students.   “Prisoners listen to fellow inmates more than teachers from outside. I also used to write letters for fellow prisoners to their relatives. I also played football three times a week, twice with fellow inmates and once for the security guards’ team,” he said.   The Masvingo-born striker grew up in Zengeza 3 and started his career with Reckshon Chapfika Makamba coached Marissa FC Under-14s.   The team, which is credited for producing the likes of Stewart Murisa, Patrick Daka and Misheck Juma among a hosts of others, used to participate in Canaan Banana’s Bona League and The President’s Trophy.   Masunda worked his way to the first team and in 1992 and was taken to Dynamos. He played in the reserves together with Chamu Musanhu, Tichaona Diya but only featured in the first team during friendly matches or when most some of the senior players were not available.   “It was a great experience at Dynamos where there were sitting arrangements on the team bus. You did not just sit anywhere. On my first day I sat in the middle with Stan Chirambadare and he was okay with it. The back seat was a no- go area,” he said with a chuckle.   “At Dynamos I lasted a year. I moved on partly because of the confusion and lack of support from management. Moreover, it was each man for himself at the team and coming from Chitungwiza, it was difficult for me,” he said.   He joined ZIMOCO FC which offered him an opportunity for Apprenticeship in Automotive Engineering. Although playing in the lower tier, he was called to the Under-23 national team which was due to face Nigeria in an Olympics qualifier.   “I did not make it to the final team. I wasn’t surprised though because most of the good players had surprisingly been overlooked,” he said.   “By my call to the Young Warriors opened floodgates as both CAPS United and Dynamos were after my signature. I remember Blackpool’s Joel, “Jubilee” Shambo and CAPS United’s Brenna Msiska coming to our Under-23 camp to asses me. I was a Dynamos supporter, but idolised Shambo.   “I signed for Blackpool and only played up to August when I joined a Turkish topflight club called Genclerbiligi Spor Kulubu.   “It didn’t work out in Turkey because of language barrier, weather, type of football and segregation. The team also changed five coaches in a short space of time.   “I was good friends with South African legends Donald Khuse and the late John Moshoeshoe and fellow Zimbabwean Norman Mapeza, from whom I would seek advice since he had lived in that country longer. Khuse advised me to join Kaizer Chiefs in 1997.”   Injuries forced him to be loaned to Seven Stars then Kaizer Chiefs. He had a stint at Makepekepe before coming to the United Kingdom in 2002.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. consumer sentiment dropped to near a 3-1/2-year low in March as the coronavirus epidemic upended life for Americans, and consumer spending was sluggish in February, strengthening economists' expectations of a deep recession.
 The reports on Friday followed on the heels of data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rocketed to a record 3.28 million last week, eclipsing the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982.
 The highly contagious virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, is wreaking havoc on the economy, prompting the Federal Reserve to take extraordinary measures and the U.S. Congress to assemble a record $2 trillion stimulus. Economists say the economy is already in recession.
 "People are struggling to understand the magnitude and duration of the economic shock from COVID-19," said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. "Job losses are the most vivid demonstration of the new reality. As the reality sinks in, confidence is likely to fall into the mid-50s by May."
 The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index fell to a reading of 89.1 this month, the lowest level since October 2016, from a final reading of 101.0 in February. It was the largest monthly drop in the index since October 2008, during the height of the financial crisis.
 Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sentiment would drop to a final reading of 90.0 this month.
 A measure of consumers' perceptions of current economic conditions dropped to 103.7 this month from a reading of 114.8 in February. The survey's gauge of consumer expectations tumbled to reading of 79.7 from 92.1 in February.
 "Stabilizing confidence at its month's-end level will be difficult given surging unemployment and falling household incomes," Richard Curtin, chief economist for the Surveys of Consumers. "The extent of additional declines in April will depend on the success in curtailing the spread of the virus and how quickly households receive funds to relieve their financial hardships."
 In a separate report on Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month as households spent more on electricity and gas, offsetting decreases in outlays on motor vehicles and parts as well as recreational goods. Last month's increase matched the gain in January and was in line with economists' expectations.
 The United States now has the most coronavirus cases in the world, with more than 85,000. Governors in more than half of the nation's 50 states have ordered residents to stay mostly indoors, affecting over 100 million people.
 Restaurants and bars have been shuttered, and airline travel severely curtailed, which economists say will greatly offset any boost to consumer spending from grocery purchases following a wave of panic buying as Americans prepared to hunker down.
 When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1% for a third straight month in February.
 U.S. stocks were trading lower as investors' focus shifted from the stimulus efforts to the damaging toll the coronavirus is inflicting on the economy. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices of U.S. Treasuries were trading mostly higher.
 MILLIONS UNEMPLOYED
 With "social distancing" measures to contain the virus throwing millions out of work and severely curtailing discretionary spending, economists are predicting a moderate decline in consumer spending in the first quarter, which would give way to a sharper contraction in the second quarter.
 "Social distancing measures taken in response to the fast-spreading coronavirus along with extreme financial market volatility will take a severe toll on the main engine of economic growth," said Lydia Boussour, a senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York.
 Consumer spending grew at an annualized rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter, slowing from the brisk 3.2% pace logged in the July-September period.
 Labor market strength, which was driving a steady pace of wage growth, was the economy's main pillar of support. In February, personal income increased 0.6%, matching January's rise. Income was boosted by higher wages and government payments to farmers caught in the 20-month long U.S.-China trade war.
 Wages advanced 0.5% last month. Income, excluding government subsidies, will be closely watched for clues on the magnitude of the anticipated economic downturn.
 Income is one of the four monthly indicators tracked by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the prestigious private research institute that is regarded as the arbiter of U.S. recessions. The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries.
 Instead, it looks for a decline in economic activity, spread across the economy and lasting more than a few months.
 "The current crisis means change is afoot," said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. "A record- shattering increase in jobless claims suggests that transfer payments will likely be the only facet of income rising in the months ahead."
 With income growth outpacing spending, savings increased to $1.38 trillion in February, the highest in a year, from $1.32 trillion in January.
 Inflation remained moderate in February. Consumer prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding the volatile food and energy components rose 0.2% for a third straight month in February. That lifted the annual increase in the so-called core PCE price index to 1.8% in February, the biggest gain since August, from 1.7% in January.
 The core PCE index is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. It missed the central bank's 2% target in 2019. (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Additional reporting by Dan Burns, Editing by Paul Simao)

U.S. Representative Thomas Massie enraged President Donald Trump as he has leaders of Congress worried he will delay a planned Friday voice vote on a 2.2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue plan, drawing calls from the White House to throw him out of the Republican Party.Even before the 49-year-old drew Trumps ire on Twitter, he had been a thorn in the side of both parties so long that hes nicknamed Mr. No. Throw Massie out of Republican Party Trump tweeted on Friday.Here are some facts about Massie - Massie was first elected in 2012 with an assist from the conservative tea party movement, from a solidly Republican district in northern Kentucky along the Ohio River. An engineer by training who had built his own company on inventions he made, he beat two establishment Republicans in a primary election along the way.- In his first House vote in 2013, Massie opposed the re-election of John Boehner as speaker. Massie aligned with conservative and libertarian Republicans who formed the Freedom Caucus in 2015, but did not join the caucus. - By 2014, Massie had voted no so many times on legislation that Politico dubbed him Mr. No. He opposed about a third of measures that came up in his first year, voting against large and small bills sponsored by both parties, from defense spending legislation to a bill to award a gold medal to golf star Jack Nicklaus.- Massie opposed many bills on a cost basis. He joked once that the buttons lawmakers push to register their votes on the House floor which are labeled yea and nay should be relabeled spend and dont spend, USA Today reported. But he voted in 2017 for hefty tax cuts promised by Trump, although they were projected to widen the deficit. It is irresponsible to increase spending and decrease taxes, which is why I consistently vote to decrease spending and decrease taxes, he said at the time.- Massie voted twice against the election of former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican. Last year he was one of six Republicans to vote against his partys candidate, Kevin McCarthy for Speaker Massie voted instead for Republican Jim Jordan, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. - Sometimes Massie has worked across party lines on civil liberties issues, such as by opposing bulk data collection by the government. Last year, Massie was the only Republican to vote against a measure rejecting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement, which opposes the Israeli occupation and policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.He was one of three House Republicans to vote against relief for Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and one of three Republicans that year to vote against additional sanctions on North Korea. One of the three, Representative Justin Amash, later left the party to become an independent.

"These rules have been provisionally modified," a statement from HFPA reads. "In light of the closure of all theatres and screening rooms in Los Angeles, the requirement that a motion picture release must be screened for HFPA members in a theatre or screening room is temporarily suspended."
 Film distributors still have to meet the timing requirements of the Golden Globes eligibility rules under which members must be able to screen English- language motion pictures no later than one week after the release in Los Angeles.
 In lieu of in-person screenings, "distributors must provide all HFPA members with a screening link or a DVD copy of the motion picture so that members may view it at home."
 Previously, the eligibility rules held that films had to be in theaters or on pay-per-view cable or pay-per-view digital delivery (not subscription cable or digital delivery) in the greater Los Angeles area for a minimum of seven days before midnight on December 31 of the qualifying year.
 Now, under the temporary rules, motion pictures need only to have "had a bona fide theatrical release planned to begin in Los Angeles" to be deemed eligible.

The snap cardigan, whose silhouette was originally imagined by the French designer agnès b, connotes class and sophistication, as simplicity does—not skate culture. Fortunately, agnès b does not rely on shop glass to display her silhouette's possibilities; fashion is meant to be worn after all, and maybe not even just _worn_. On Chrystie Street in February, a host of artists—including the three horsemen of the unpredictable, Harmony Korine, Gaspar Noé, and Jim Jarmusch—were invited to display photographs capturing their own interpretation of the garment. Their only restriction: a democratic dimension of 40 × 60 centimeters for all. Here, two artists and godfathers of skateboarding, Ed Templeton and William Strobeck, discuss their participation in the collection, photographing people on the fly, and backside flips. — _BESSIE RUBINSTEIN_

 He said: "We are trying to play our part and do the best we can to help out at this time, but it isn't easy. All our staff and volunteers came together to set this up in only five days so as you can imagine we've been flat out working around the clock to get to this point, and it isn't slowing down.
 "There's so many people to thank, and they've all done a great job in delivering food to people’s doors around the borough, picking up medications, and just generally taking care of the vulnerable people who need a hand.
 "It's a terrible time but one thing it has done is show the amazing spirit we have here in the valleys with everyone in the community coming together.
 "From local businesses giving donations, to volunteers from different community groups all helping with deliveries, the response has been absolutely great, and it’s something I think we're going to need more of in the coming months.
 "We're all going to stick together throughout this pandemic and we want people to know that we're here for them if they need us. "

Why has Calvi chosen this rather eccentric approach for her new album? Possibly, she's feeling the pressure of following _Hunter_ and has put this out as a placeholder. Were the guest vocalists brought in to entice people to pick up _Hunted_ , who possibly wouldn't have bought it if it had just been a collection of her demos? I genuinely think not, but for the most part, those cameos add little or nothing to the pieces and take away from the raw immediacy of the recordings that to which they have been added. This record falls between being a snapshot of a work in progress and a fully-fledged recording and as such, is curiously unsatisfying. A "warts and all" approach really should have been the way to go. "Indies or Paradise", the last track on _Hunted_ , is all Calvi, her voice soaring as she brutally attacks her guitar, invoking PJ Harvey at the peak of her powers. More of this, please.

In 2018, Arizona Democrats won a 5-4 majority in the U.S. House delegation and elected a Democratic U.S. Senator, Kyrsten Sinema. This year the Democratic candidate, former astronaut Mark Kelly, is favored to defeat Sen. Martha McSally. She lost to Sinema but was appointed to the Senate after the death of John McCain. The last time Arizona had two Democratic senators was 1952, when television sets were still novelties. Democrats need to gain only two state House seats and three state Senate seats to control the legislature for the first time since 1966, when many television sets were still black-and-white. The secretary of state and superintendent of public education are Democrats.
 Every day an average of 200 people bring their politics with them as they move to Phoenix. Arizona trails only Florida and Nevada among states with the lowest percentage of native-born residents.
 Rotellini had the misfortune to run for state attorney general in two dreadful years for Democrats, 2010 (during the tea party backlash against George W. Bush's Troubled Asset Relief Program - TARP, Obamacare and other grievances) and 2014 (the midterm election during the second term of a president from her party). As she toils to turn Arizona blue, Trump is being helpful.
 In his exuberant disregard of constitutional niceties, he "repurposed" (Washington's preferred euphemism for nullifying Congress' power of the purse) $30 million appropriated for construction at Arizona's U.S. Army Fort Huachuca to spend on his $18 billion border wall, which a majority of Arizonans oppose.
 Speaking of walls, this year Trump will have to spend time and money to hold Arizona, another increasingly loose brick in the red wall that has protected Republicans' increasingly narrow path to 270 electoral votes. Two other such bricks are Texas and Georgia. Stay tuned.

MONTREAL -- The first person in Montreal to die of COVID-19 was a member of the city's Hasidic Jewish community.
 Max Lieberman, with the Council of Hasidic Jews of Quebec, said today the 67-year-old man started exhibiting flu-like symptoms on Sunday and died Wednesday.
 Lieberman says the family had a private, graveside funeral service instead of the more typical large affair given rules forbidding gatherings amid the COVID-19 outbreak.
 He says the community is on edge because many members had participated in large gatherings for a religious holiday, just prior to the introduction of widespread isolation directives by health authorities.
 But Lieberman says the stress eases with each day that passes without a spike in the community's infection numbers.
 As of Thursday, 48 per cent of Quebec's COVID-19 cases were reported in Montreal and the city's west-end is deemed a hot spot for the virus.
 Dr. Horacio Arruda, Quebec's director of public health, says authorities are monitoring that part of the city and will implement further measures as needed.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 27, 2020.

U.S. Representative Thomas Massie enraged President Donald Trump as he has leaders of Congress worried he will delay a planned Friday voice vote on a $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic rescue plan, drawing calls from the White House to throw him out of the Republican Party.
 Even before the 49-year-old drew Trump's ire on Twitter, he had been a thorn in the side of both parties so long that he's nicknamed "Mr. No." "Throw Massie out of Republican Party!" Trump tweeted on Friday.
 Here are some facts about Massie: - Massie was first elected in 2012 with an assist from the conservative tea party movement, from a solidly Republican district in northern Kentucky along the Ohio River. An engineer by training who had built his own company on inventions he made, he beat two establishment Republicans in a primary election along the way.
 \- In his first House vote in 2013, Massie opposed the re-election of John Boehner as speaker. Massie aligned with conservative and libertarian Republicans who formed the Freedom Caucus in 2015, but did not join the caucus. - By 2014, Massie had voted "no" so many times on legislation that Politico dubbed him "Mr. No." He opposed about a third of measures that came up in his first year, voting against large and small bills sponsored by both parties, from defense spending legislation to a bill to award a gold medal to golf star Jack Nicklaus.
 \- Massie opposed many bills on a cost basis. He joked once that the buttons lawmakers push to register their votes on the House floor – which are labeled "yea" and "nay" – should be relabeled "spend" and "don’t spend," USA Today reported. But he voted in 2017 for hefty tax cuts promised by Trump, although they were projected to widen the deficit. "It is irresponsible to increase spending and decrease taxes, which is why I consistently vote to decrease spending and decrease taxes," he said at the time.
 \- Massie voted twice against the election of former House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican. Last year he was one of six Republicans to vote against his party's candidate, Kevin McCarthy for Speaker; Massie voted instead for Republican Jim Jordan, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus. - Sometimes Massie has worked across party lines on civil liberties issues, such as by opposing bulk data collection by the government. Last year, Massie was the only Republican to vote against a measure rejecting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement, which opposes the Israeli occupation and policies toward Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
 He was one of three House Republicans to vote against relief for Hurricane Harvey in 2017, and one of three Republicans that year to vote against additional sanctions on North Korea. One of the three, Representative Justin Amash, later left the party to become an independent.

Control is still arguably the best-looking game on the market, making use of state-of-the-art effects and art assets. Gameplay was adversely affected by the aging PS4 and Xbox One hardware and, like the main game, The Foundation is best experienced on a very powerful PC equipped with one of NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards. When maxed out, the visual presentation is second-to-none and The Foundation introduces NVIDIA's new DLSS 2.0 technology that allows enhanced visuals and increased performance. In some cases, the game may look better and run up to 75% faster when enabling DLSS 2.0, though the feature is exclusive to RTX graphics cards. I'd expect an enhanced version of Control to make an appearance on the upcoming PS5 and Xbox Series X with steady frame rates and ray-tracing features enabled at some time in the future.

Calm down, don’t panic shop, live regular life, think for yourself
 “Wash your hands. Go home. Get some rest. Drink fluids. Have some chicken noodle soup.”
 Whew! Glad we solved that one, folks. If I have to hear much more repetition of the manners and cleanliness behaviors I was taught in Sunday school or kindergarten and how we’ve been curing viral bouts since the Dark Ages, I’m going to go home and start throwing furniture.
 Yes, to clarify a few things up front, I’m not taking this whole coronavirus thing in with hyper-delusional, panic-stricken consumer-it is — I’m just being real and grounded about it.
 Now, before you chastise me or label me a non-believer who has opted to exist in complete denial, know I say these things having a Dad with stage-four cancer, two grandchildren under the age of two and a number of elderly people in my life whom I care a great deal for. I’d be more worried of more of these “high-risk” groups were overly worried themselves. By and large, they most certainly are not. Several retired folks I know were at casinos this past week, so hit the brakes for a second here.
 Yes, older people are certainly more at risk — fractionally and single- percentage speaking — just as they are with every flu, cold, bout with pneumonia or bronchitis as they are during this very season.
 While I am well aware I am a smidge below the average age demographic here in our readership area, I have a fondness for modern history and observing human behavior — and over the last handful of years, I really started listening to those older than myself much more than I did in the past, too. My predecessors here at the newspaper aggressively imparted this trait in me with unabashed fervor and I’ve soaked up as much of it as humanly possible.
 I definitely don’t remember anything about the 1918 Flu — nor does anyone reading this — but I can speak at length to the societal impact of Bird Flu, SARS, MERS, H1N1, Y2K, 9-11, and a number of other national or global situations which caused insane financial, commercial and personal havoc. If you want to make any medical comparison with a baseline of 100 years ago, go ahead, but please do so factoring in the lightyears we have come since that time in the medical realm equally. Drawing a parallel to something we dealt with during the World War I era without relativity or context is wholly and intentionally inaccurate to the core. We were still treating illnesses with liquid mercury, silver sulphate, raw meat and cocaine. X-rays were in their infancy, the invention of the iron lung was still a decade away and “preventative medicine” in any real sense did not exist. Just sayin’.
 So, as people continue to drink the “doomsday Kool-Aid” and voluntarily opt to progress into full-blown panic, do yourself a favor and sniff around to see who gains from this financially/economically … hint: it’s not small businesses or middle America in any way.
 Now compare what the hoarding and shutdown itself have already done to society.
 Remember, as the coronavirus is being used as this decade’s invisible boogeyman, this has happened before — and certainly will happen again. While we’re being force-fed this exacerbated narrative full of fear and control, the second long-term cured case of AIDS was announced the same week this pandemic went public, 22 veterans still commit suicide every day — meaning more veterans have committed suicide in the same time the coronavirus started claiming American lives — and instantly, no one’s talking about cancer, influenza and heart disease deaths right now. Let that sink in for a second. Make of it what you will, but it is interesting food for thought, huh?
 Last I checked, the local grocery store still is relatively well-stocked with infant formula, feminine hygiene products, diapers, meat, cheese, milk, bread, Friskies and Purina — all of which makes me wonder about blindly unchecked immediate media consumption, consumer reaction and a number of my fellow area residents’ actual priorities.
 For the record, anyone politicizing this should be ashamed of themselves, too. Regardless of anyone’s views or opinions, now is most certainly not the time or place for partisan blame from any side of any aisle. Nothing more should need to be said on this topic. Period.
 We’re establishing a dangerous precedent here as our country’s new policy to any number of situations. By feeding into this frenzy, we’re ensuring it will be this way again the next time there’s cause for panic. And, the more frenzied we are as a whole, the worse this all will get.
 As this situation swiftly plateaus, calms and passes, please be decent to one another, check on those older than you and stay rational when it comes to what you actually need in your life.
 Odds are, 600 rolls of toilet paper and 80 pounds of rice is not going to help you much, but making sure your parents, neighbors and elderly loved ones are OK will matter more than anything at the moment. Check on them, see if they need anything, offer to drop a few things off, call and talk with them for 20 minutes — little things like that matter.
 That last bit is probably something we all should be doing more of anyway.
 I’ll still be in the office — with a single can of Lysol on my desk — and I’ll still be going to third Wednesday fire department trainings, taking first- responder calls when I can and grocery shopping for regular stuff on the weekend like my better half and I do every month.
 And, if Pops calls me to go fishing on newspaper day, you can bet the rent the two of us still can be found with our lines in the water on Stockton Lake — six-ten feet apart and on opposite ends of the boat, of course.
 Keep calm and carry on, Cedar County. I plan on doing much the same.

Then-governor Pedro Rossello brought the committee up to speed by reporting on the "futility" of the 1993 plebiscite. "My administration made a point of inviting Puerto Rico's three political parties to define for themselves the political status option that they would endorse in our 1993 plebiscite," he explained. "Regrettably, that good faith gesture resulted in inclusion on the ballot of a Commonwealth definition that was utterly unrealistic… a solution that would have imbued Puerto Rico with many of the benefits of U.S. statehood and many of the prerogatives of independence, while exempting Puerto Rico from most of the responsibilities inherent in both of these options. The 1993 commonwealth ballot definition, in other words, amounted to a wish list. It was both politically unattainable and constitutionally inadmissible."

Local women and groups of volunteers have been taking up new sewing projects in light of the recent coronavirus pandemic — face masks.
 Tri County Church Director of Team Development Angel Reiter Smith said there are 41 volunteers working on sewing masks between all church campuses in Mill Hall, Punxsutawney, Clearfield, DuBois, Ridgway, Grampian and online.
 Nikki Sommers, a TCC member, said the church recently created a website that allows anyone in the community to submit a request for help. Church volunteers have signed up to receive emails about these requests, including helping people get groceries or making face masks, and are assigned when a need comes in.
 “I signed up for every option,” Sommers said. “I wanted to get every email in case I could help. It’s what we are called to do — God calls us to be the church to help others in a time where there is so much uncertainty.”
 A request for face masks was submitted by a local nursing home Friday night, Sommers said.
 “I thought, that’s something I can do — I can’t buy groceries for everyone, but I can sew,” she said.
 Sommers’ mother, Wendy Wilson, is also sewing masks. Together, they have created around 70 cotton masks with Wilson’s leftover craft fabric, some with bright and creative patterns.
 Cheryl Oknefski, founder of Peaces of Me Studio in Ridgway, and her sister, local substitute teacher June Johnson, are also sewing masks. Oknefski said she, too, came across a Facebook post about sewing masks, and thought “Let’s do this.”
 Oknefski, who has made eight masks and has eight more to make currently, said she and her sister are both giving the masks away to people who work in healthcare and other professions in need.

PLYMOUTH - It was a season that both the coach and his players expect to learn from.
 First-year Head Coach Steven Whyte and his Plymouth South boys hockey team didn't get into the win column anywhere near as much as they would have liked this winter, but injuries and illness opened up the door for some of the younger Panthers in the program to get some varsity experience that will be invaluable down the line.
 "That's one of the bright spots coming of this season," Whyte said about the 4-16-1 record his team posted this season. "When some of our top players had to miss some time, the younger players stepped in and gave me some big minutes on the ice this season. That experience will make them better players next season and beyond."
 Things actually began pretty well for the Panthers with a 2-2-1 start over the first quarter of the season, including wins over Sandwich and Scituate, as well as a tie with Pembroke.
 But that's when South's trouble started.
 "Right around the turn of the year we lost (senior) Chase Sacco (broken ankle) and senior Captain Nick Gregg (back injury) for the rest of the season," Whyte said. "They are a couple huge parts of our defense, so we ended up being very young and inexperienced on the blue line for the rest of the season.
 "Around the same time as those injuries we lost even more key veteran players to illness and a couple concussions," said Whyte, which left the team behind the eight ball.
 The young and still growing defense, added with issues scoring goals, equaled some tough days at the office for the Panther goaltending crew. South was outscored 114-39 this season, being held to a goal or less in nine of their 21 games.
 Whyte praised the work of senior tri-captains Gregg, Thomas Nolan and Nick Ferrell in keeping the team together as they navigated some choppy water. Forward Matt Daley and Sacco are the other two seniors who will be leaving the program.
 "Even after he was injured (Nick Gregg) remained a huge part of this team. He was always positive with his teammates and made everyone feel like they were an important part of the process," Whyte said. "Thomas was a real team leader who always had his finger on the pulse of the team, and (Nick Ferrell) was the hardest worker in the program. He doesn't know how to give anything less than 100 percent."
 Junior forward Casey Donovan led the team in scoring with 10 goals and four assists this winter. Junior forward Chris Colbert had seven goals and three assists, while freshman forward Kenny Thurston showed some promise with a goal and 10 assists on the season.
 Ferrell and Colbert were both named to the Patriot League All-Star team. Colbert also won the Patriot League Scholar-Athlete and Gregg won the Sportsmanship Award.
 Whyte had T-shirts made up for the players at the end of the season that contained a message that he hopes the players will take with them as we head into the off-season: "Nothing changes if nothing changes."
 "That's the way everyone in the program has to think, from the coaches to the players. Things didn't go our way this season, but we can stop that from happening again with the work we all put in during the off-season," Whyte said. "This team showed me this season that they are willing to pull together and fight as a team so we have build on that fighting spirit and work towards improving.
 "We need to learn from our losses and make the changes we need to make to get back to the top."
 Whyte includes himself on the list of things that can be improved before the team gets together again in November.
 "I think I understood the X's and O's that go along with being a head coach, but there's so many other parts of the job that surprise you," Whyte said, looking back on his first season as leader on the South hockey program.
 "One of biggest challenges was trying figure out how to coach each kid on the team. Every kid is different and everyone takes better to a particular style of coaching. A head coach has to figure those things out."

Tavi Costa: Sure. I think that that’s the idea of that was exactly what I mentioned earlier, which was, those are the two things that have not really break out in a big way was the consumer confidence and labour markets in general. Some parts of the labour market started to break. We’ve had a you know plunging job openings, numbers, as we stated that many times, you had jobs, continuing jobless claims beginning to, to rise in a year over year basis. No. First time since the global financial crisis two, I think that uh, but you know that that that really was the idea of that ratio was to look for Okay, well, how low can unemployment rates go? And how high can consumer confidence really go? If we look at a ratio of that, you know, how high is it relative to history? And is it it is at its highest level since the global since the tech bubble in the 1973-74, right prior to those recessions as well. But we have, you know, even prior to the outbreak here of the virus, we’ve had a lot of macro deterioration in general aminute, we’ve had earnings were contracting significantly. Even prior to that we had the yield curve inversions, which we even we didn’t even touch much here. But Yoker inversions is critical. I mean, we calculate a different way resident looks If one or two or three spreads, we looked at the all the spreads all the possible 45 spreads in the yield curve, and calculate how many of those are actually inverted. And we realised that about 73% of them are exactly 72% of yield curve. The US yield curve was inverted, back in August of 2019. And every time we hit the handle of 70%, we’ve had a recession all the way back to the 70s a perfect track record, either preheated a recession or coincided with one, it’s proving right. Again, I think that this this indicator is going to be right, in my view, and again, when you looked at what are the best holdings, what are the best assets to own during those times, and if you do the empirical analysis of that, you realise that it’s owning gold and selling stocks, you know, in other words is owning the go to s&p 500 ratio, and that you know, tends to even double in a two year horizon regardless if it is because of gold prices rising significantly or just stock prices. Is plunging you know 50-60% depending on the levels and now we have this sort of a massive commodity to equity ratio distortion going back in history, especially with precious metals, and that gives another conviction to to go there and implement that trade. But you know, so you know, combining that with or 16 factor macro model there was also signalling that we’re very late in the business cycle I think that all kind of signal that we’re you know, that the markets are very close to falling apart. And then when the virus outbreak started, you had copper prices and oil prices completely plunging, number one you had gold and and in treasuries rally significantly, especially in the first part of it, even prior to the equity markets declining. And that really kind of preceded the whole situation in our view, and and now everything is unfolding very quickly. This bizarre disorderly sell off that we’re seeing I mean, it’s it’s, you know, we’re overdue for that. And it’s incredible that when you start seeing that people remember of December 2018, that that whole sell off that happened back then. And now it’s even worse than that. But as people remember that they really, you know, they really embrace that idea and start getting risk off the table. And that’s how you see this playing out so quickly. I think it’s just the beginning. Really, I mean, this. Now, in our view, this is a trend that is going to go a lot lower. We’re way too far in terms of valuations.

BOSTON - A visibly frustrated Gov. Charlie Baker lobbed criticism at the federal government for the challenges states face in acquiring protective equipment for medical workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic.
 In his daily press conference on Thursday, just before the state announced 579 new cases and 25 deaths from the disease, Baker announced several health and human service policy reforms aimed at increasing access to aid for the state's most vulnerable residents. And he requested the federal government declare a major disaster in Massachusetts.
 Baker grew increasingly irritated - and almost cursed - as he fielded questions about keeping doctors, nurses and other front-line workers safe from the infectious disease. He said he and other governors around the country are "killing ourselves" trying to purchase personal protective equipment, only to watch their efforts fall apart when they are outbid by Washington.
 "We are doing everything we can through an incredibly messy thicket that is enormously frustrating for all of us to try to get them the gear they deserve and need," Baker said. "I stand here as someone who has had confirmed orders for millions of pieces of gear evaporate in front of us, and I can't tell you how frustrating it is."
 On a public conference call the Trump administration hosted with governors last week, Baker told President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that Massachusetts "lost to the feds" trying to acquire supplies for its fight against the outbreak.
 Trump replied that while he liked the push by governors to bring in more equipment for their states, they likely lost because "price is always a component." The federal government has also been distributing equipment to the states, but not at the rate that many governors would like to see.
 The governor has continued to raise concerns at every opportunity, he said Thursday, but securing orders "continues to be, in some respects, one of the biggest challenges we face."
 "We now have other orders that are outstanding that are probably quote-unquote confirmed, but we've literally gotten to the point where our basic position is: until the god-- " Baker said, cutting himself off mid-word, "-- until the things show up here in the commonwealth of Mass., it doesn't exist."
 Massachusetts has already spent more than $28 million on the personal protective equipment, referred to as PPE, and medical equipment alone, Baker wrote in a Thursday letter to Trump.
 In that letter, Baker sought additional federal help for Massachusetts through a formal major disaster declaration. That move, he said at Thursday's press conference, would provide assistance such as financial aid to cities, towns, state agencies and nonprofits.
 Baker wrote that responding to the magnitude of the crisis "is beyond the capabilities of state and local governments" and requested additional disaster unemployment assistance and crisis counseling assistance alongside the declaration.
 "Preliminary damage assessments are impossible to perform at this time due to the dynamic nature of this pandemic, but cases continue to increase each day and ongoing life-saving response activities are overwhelming both state and local resources," Baker told the president.
 Unemployment claims are soared in Massachusetts to 147,995 during the week ending March 21 up from 7,449 non-seasonally adjusted claims filed the previous week. The 3.28 million initial claims filed nationwide last week far surpassed any previous records.
 Baker said the state's unemployment system received a "15-fold increase" in applications in recent weeks, a level of demand that the Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development has been able to handle without the system crashing.
 About 10 days ago, he said, the department's call center had roughly 50 people in it. That amount bumped up to 300 this week and will likely be 400 next week to cope with the surge.
 He stressed Thursday that workers filing claims need to list the same employer name on their applications as they did on their W-2 form to ensure proper processing.
 A day after he ordered all schools and child care centers to remain closed through May 4, Baker pushed back against shuttering them for the rest of the school year as some governors in other states have done.
 While he said the administration will "track the facts on the ground" and avoid opening schools if doing so would present a public health risk, he said the state should -- if it is safe to do so -- allow students to finish the year.
 "We should be committed to the idea that if it's safe, we want kids to be able to finish the year," Baker said. "I don't want to toss away the second half of a student's possibility to learn what they need to learn to succeed in the next grade. How does that help anybody? I've wondered all along on this one. If we literally just broom the rest of the school year, that would mean every student in Massachusetts, for all intents and purposes, would either have to stay back, not graduate, or, if they moved head to the next grade, they would move ahead or they would graduate from high school having missed literally almost half a year of educational experience."
 Baker said the internet and other digital tools can help foster a learning environment at home, but that "there are a lot of kids for whom school is going to be the place where they have the biggest and the best and the most significant opportunity to get the kind of education they need."
 In other steps announced Thursday, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders said the state waived nurse-to-patient staffing ratios at hospitals and will allow pharmacists licensed in other states to practice in a Massachusetts-licensed pharmacy or health care facility.
 Officials set up a hotline on Wednesday to connect individuals with disabilities with home health care aides when their personal care attendants are unable to work during the public health emergency.
 The state will convert the Newton Pavilion, a former Boston Medical Center hospital building it owns, into a specialized care center for homeless individuals and families during the coronavirus outbreak. That site will feature up to 250 beds and can provide both health care and post-discharge care for individuals in and around the city without permanent residences.
 COVID-19 hospitalizations in Massachusetts more than doubled overnight to 219 as the number of total cases increased to 2,417 and deaths jumped to 25, according to Department of Public Health data released Thursday afternoon.
 Baker said Thursday that 21 laboratories are now online to test for the virus, nearly double the capacity the state had just two days earlier.

Support for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has fallen below 50 for the first time, hit by criticism of his response to the coronavirus crisis, public security concerns and a struggling economy, a daily tracking poll showed on Friday.The survey, by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky for newspaper El Economista, showed that Lopez Obradors approval rating had dropped to 49.6 from 50.1 a day earlier. Roy Campos, the head of Mitofsky, said the coronavirus pandemic was seriously affecting support for Lopez Obrador, as was concern over the economic outlook.Just as there is fear of getting sick, theres now fear about the economy, Campos said. Lopez Obrador, whose approval rating stood at 80 barely a year ago in some surveys, has suffered a steady drop in popularity since discontent over his reaction to highly publicized murders of women last month sparked protests.The leftist, who took office in December 2018, has also come under fire for his handling of the coronavirus crisis since the first case of infection was confirmed in Mexico on Feb. 28. While his medical experts urged people to avoid physical contact and stay at home to contain the spread of the virus, the president has continued to hold mass rallies around Mexico, shaking hands with, hugging and kissing supporters.Meanwhile, Mexico tipped into recession during his first year in office, dragged down by a decline in investment spurred by concern over his unpredictable management of the economy. Rating agency SP downgraded Mexicos credit rating on Thursday, flagging concern over the outlook.Some private sector economists say the Mexican economy could contract by as much as 7 this year. At the end of 2019, Lopez Obrador had the support of more than 59 of respondents in the Mitofsky tracking poll.

Anyone who went to art college will know the importance of a sketchbook. Those first exploratory marks on paper are about as raw as creativity gets, and they often possess an immediacy and spontaneity that the final, finished version lacks. The same is true of songwriting – that first surge of creativity, recorded quickly and often with little care for production values, can be a fascinating glimpse into the creative process. As the piece develops, it gets finessed, but that can mean that the quirks and idiosyncrasies that gave it an initial edge, get airbrushed out. On _Hunted_ , Anna Calvi has gone back to the demo recordings made for her 2018 album _Hunter_ and has reworked them, but this time with the input of Courtney Barnett, Joe Talbot (from Idles), Charlotte Gainsbourg and Julia Holter. Calvi had spotted characteristics in those raw recordings which she wanted to bring to the forefront, but this approach seems to result in her making the same album twice.
 On _Hunted_ , Calvi plays her best card early. The opening track, "Swimming Pool" is gorgeous. Over a simple, but beautifully played guitar figure, Calvi, joined on this song by Julia Holter, creates an almost new-age soundscape, which holds your attention from the first note to the last. Calvi and Holter's voices mesh perfectly together, and there is a raw starkness to the song, which is incredibly compelling. It sets the bar very high for the rest of the record. "Hunter" is one the tracks on this album which features Calvi, alone. A backdrop of synths and guitar, emphasize the darkness of the lyric, while her heavy breathing, used as a rhythm track adds to the unsettling mood of the piece.
