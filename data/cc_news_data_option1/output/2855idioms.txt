On the North shore of the Minas Basin in Nova Scotia, Canada, the Geopark features a varied landscape of hills, mountains, valleys, heavily forested areas, and coastal marshlands. Its broad biodiversity includes rare birds, fungi and plants. Minas Basin, an inlet in the Bay of Fundy, which is known for having the highest tides on Earth, is part of the Geopark that features exposures of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, the largest outpouring of lava in Earth history, fossils of early dinosaurs, vertebrates and more. The indigenous people of the region, The Mi’kmaq, have lived in the area for thousands of years, making it one of the earliest known sites of human habitation in northeastern North America. Passed down through the ages, their stories explain many geosites and the communities of Cliffs of Fundy are committed to preserving them for future generations.

n El Balon de Oro no sera entrgado a ningun jugador en 2020 debido a «las circunstancias excepcionales» en las que se ha desarrollado la temporada de futbol, segun anuncio ayer la revista organizadora del galardon, «France Football». «Por primera vez en la historia, desde 1956, el Balon de Oro de France Football no sera atribuido en 2020 pues no se dan las suficientes condiciones de igualdad», informo la revista en sus redes sociales.
 El semanario considera que se trata de un año singular que no debe ser tratado como uno ordinario y que la equidad en el trato a todos los jugadores no se da en 2020 ni «a nivel estadistico ni de preparacion», ya que los aspirantes a la recompensa no han podido participar en la temporada de la misma manera.
 «France Football» ha preferido anular el premio que retrasarlo hasta 2021, un parentesis que asumen con tristeza pero consideran que es la decision mas responsable y logica.
 Su redactor jefe, Pascal Ferre, confirmo en la emisora «France Info» que se trata de una medida puntual y que, aunque «es dificil proyectarse en el futuro», habra nuevas ediciones del premio despues de este paron. «Proteger la credibilidad de tal recompensa es tambien vigilar que sea irreprochable a largo plazo», apunta el comunicado publicado en la web de la revista, que en 2019 otorgo el trofeo al argentino Leo Messi.
 Estiman, ademas, que ha habido poco de tiempo para «jugar y juzgar» teniendo en cuenta las condiciones extraordinarias en las que se han desarrollado los partidos (a puerta cerrada, con sustituciones o, en el caso de la Liga de Campeones, en forma de un torneo reducido). En estas condiciones, otorgar el Balon de Oro no seria «digno de su historia», pues el contexto de la pandemia ha impuesto «otras urgencias».

Toddlers must think parents are magicians. We make fire at the flick of a finger, make food appear out of thin air, and even read minds (e.g., you're sleepy). It's no wonder kids have a wildly inaccurate perception of their parents as they grow up.
   
 They don't see their mom working to make dinner, or the time that goes into list making and grocery shopping and recipe learning. They just see her wave a spoon like a magic wand and find food on their plate. They don't see the years of experience and work that go into gathering the knowledge of which ointment or home remedy to apply to a cut or scrape to instantly make it all better. Nope, she just says, "all better" and so it is.
   
 They don't see their dad work to cut tree limbs or chop wood, they just see him conjure fire from his fingertips on suddenly appearing logs. Lightning, thunder, garbage trucks, big dogs, and other giants of the toddler world are all engaged without fear (or at least not fled from in terror) by their parents. How do they do it, the kids wonder.
   
 And this doesn't even touch on the technology aided magic. We can make Mickey Mouse appear on a screen with the touch of a button or even just our voice. We can conjure grandpa and grandma's or their cousins' presence on a phone or computer with no apparent effort.
   
 If kids in the past had all the normal reasons to be in awe and look up to their parents, today's kids have no reason to doubt the wizardry of theirs. We fly, can command food and household items to appear on the doorstep, and can see in the dark. Shoot, we can see everywhere.
   
 I mean, it's getting to the point where superheroes are going to be pretty boring. Kids are going to go back to wanting to be like their parents when they grow up instead of an Avenger, Superman, or whatever a "PJ Masks" is.
   
 This is obviously a bit over the top, but I do wonder about the way toddlers and kids are experiencing childhood in this 21st Century. Much of daily life is convenient, easy, and effortless (although perhaps lately less so) and a side effect could be that they think we're wizards. But the side effect could also be a learned laziness and spoiled attitude.
   
 I guess for now I should just appreciate the fact they think I'm a wizard. And not tip my hand to all the tricks.

Adds comment from second congressional official; no response from FBI, intelligence office)
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress appears to the target of a foreign disinformation campaigned aimed at influencing lawmakers' activities and the upcoming presidential contest, top Democrats said in a letter released on Monday.
 In a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray dated July 13, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees said they were "gravely concerned" that Congress seemed to be in the crosshairs of "a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November."
 The nature of the disinformation campaign was not made clear, although the letter referred to the threat as serious and specific.
 One congressional official said that the Democrats' letter was prompted by the accumulation of intelligence. The official declined to discuss in detail any of the specific intelligence reporting or analyses that raised such concerns. A second congressional official said that a classified addendum was sent alongside the letter that drew mainly from the U.S. government's own reporting.
 No Republican lawmakers signed the letter. The FBI and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The researchers focused on the Murge karst plateau in Apulia, where Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens coexisted for at least 3,000 years, from approximately 45,000 to 42,000 years ago. This study was published in  _Nature Ecology & Evolution_. Data extracted from the stalagmites showed that climate changes that happened during that time span were not particularly significant. "Our study shows that this area of Apulia appears as a 'climate niche' during the transition from Neanderthals to Homo Sapiens" explains Andrea Columbu, researcher and first author of this study. "It doesn't seem possible that significant climate changes happened during that period, at least not impactful enough to cause the extinction of Neanderthals in Apulia and, by the same token, in similar areas of the Mediterranean".

Adds Mnuchin comment after meeting)
 By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Advisers to President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats were set to discuss the next steps in responding to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday, with congressional Republicans saying they were working on a $1 trillion relief bill.
 In a meeting on Monday at the White House, Republican lawmakers and administration officials said they were making progress toward fresh legislation aimed at cushioning the heavy economic toll of the pandemic.
 "Senate Republicans will put forward our proposal soon, I hope our Democratic colleagues will be ready to work together," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hopes to unveil the proposal this week.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will host a meeting on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus relief with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a source familiar with the matter said.
 Administration officials also met with Republican senators at the Capitol on Monday. They said the meeting had gone well and they planned more discussions on Tuesday.
 They offered few details, with Mnuchin commenting only that a reporter's suggestion that there would be more than $70 billion for schools was "a good guess."
 The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Republican proposal would include a cut to the payroll tax on workers' gross earnings, which funds national retirement programs. Trump backs such a cut as an economic stimulus, but the idea has stirred little enthusiasm among lawmakers, who worry about protecting Social Security payments.
 "We're working and negotiating with the Democrats and trying to get a plan that helps small business, helps people, helps this country," Trump said.
 Mnuchin did not provide details about the bill beyond saying that it included the payroll tax cut. "It's in the bill, so we'll see," he told reporters.
 Schumer warned that Democrats were prepared to stymie any Republican effort to pass partisan legislation. "A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people," he said in a letter to colleagues.
 'NOWHERE NEAR OUT OF THE WOODS'
 Congress has so far committed $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last bill into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million. The virus has killed over 140,000 people in the United States. Both figures lead the world.
 "We are nowhere near out of the woods," McConnell said.
 Mnuchin, who led previous coronavirus bill negotiations with Congress, said he intended to "focus on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will have a big impact."
 But Democrats have pledged to fight for legislation akin to a $3 trillion bill the House approved in mid-May, providing hundreds of billions of dollars for state and local governments, extending enhanced unemployment insurance and providing new payments to individuals and families.
 The prospect for legislation was upstaged over the weekend by reports of White House plans to eliminate funding for testing, drawing opposition from Republicans as well as Democrats.
 "I'm for whatever it takes to get enough tests out there to safely open up schools and other aspects of our economy," Senator John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, told reporters.

In fact, since Rawalpindi had already achieved its aim of diverting international and domestic attention from this despicable carnage by its soldiers by making PTM the scapegoat, to continue pursuing this case in courts made no sense and also ran the risk of exposing the truth. As it is, the Pakistan army has disregarded Amnesty International’s directions that this incident “should be fully investigated to determine if there was any use of excessive force and if any resulting killing was unlawful.” So, it would not want this incident to be resurrected through the courts and revive the controversy surrounding this shooting.

AFTER the last-minute decision to pull the plug on the return to play, the Northern Rivers Regional Rugby League board has confirmed games will proceed this weekend.


  NRRRL chairman Mark Harrison said the board would be contacting all the clubs to say that games would resume this weekend.


  Harrison said while clubs “were not happy” with the NRRRL’s decision, it was done with the clubs’ best interests at heart.


  He said the NSW Rugby League’s decision to ban spectators would have seen clubs lose potential income holding the matches under strict pandemic protocols.


  “The phone ran hot,” he said.


  “We were guided by a decision made by NSW Rugby which restricted any supporters from watching the game live ... (it) would have a negative impact on clubs’ finances.”


  Harrison said the NRRRL had to make a hard call to save clubs already facing tough times.


  “They said crowds had to be completely limited which they interpreted to allow players and essential staff only at the grounds,” he said.


  “This advice from NSWRL would mean no crowds and no money for the clubs who need to raise around $35,000 per annum.


  “Gate takings and other income pays for essential things like strapping tape, player insurance and referees being paid so they need the gate income to pay those bills.”


  Harrison said he also felt for the fans, but hoped they would be out supporting their players and clubs this weekend.


  “The simple fact is if we do the right things our game will survive, and if we don’t, it won’t,” he said.


  He said the NRRRL recognised the passion of its fans who love the game and want very much to be part of the sporting experience


  The match line-ups for this weekend will remain the same, Harrison said.


  Harrison also confirmed if Lower Clarence, Kyogle and Evans Head wanted to rejoin the season, the NRRRL wouldfind a way.


  It is understood to competition will remain over 10 weeks, reducing the finals series to a top four (run over three weekends) finishing in October.

If a movie did not receive the PCA seal, it should not be released. Distributors who still tried to release a movie would be subject to a fine. There was also a major hangup for anyone trying to undermine the Code. At this time in history, Hollywood studios not only had control of most of the movies that came out, but they also had control of a huge portion of theaters across the country. That meant if a distributor tried to release a movie without the PCA seal of approval, MPAA studio members could prevent it from playing in their cinema chains across the country.

One that has ceased to have its original meaning in the Constitution is “president.” Beginning with the two terms of George W. Bush and his consigliere, Vice President Dick Cheney, the White House has argued that, under the 2001 AUMF a president has virtually unlimited dictatorial power. Only fear of public outrage constrained both Bush and Obama from exercising that claimed power, which is why their actions were largely behind the scenes — approving torture, extrajudicial killings of Americans by drone, massive electronic eavesdropping, and secret renditions and years of detention without trial for captives. Trump has tossed out any such concerns about public outrage, and, apparently fearful of being pushed of power in this November’s election, appears to be going for broke with a full assumption of unrestrained police power.

"It's easy for corporations to point the finger at police. What they should do is point the fingers at themselves as well, because racial justice is economic justice. Those things are linked together," Murphy said. "The same conditions that exploit and harm and cause the killing of Black and brown lives are the same conditions that exploit and harm black and brown folks who want to earn a livable wage."

Censorship becomes the debate _du jour_ at least once a year. Recently, streaming platforms removing racist content from their libraries has sparked conversations about censorship again. HBO MAX came under fire for pulling _Gone With the Wind_from its TCM curated selection of old movies. The streaming service quickly decided to add it back to the platform with a video preceding the movie in order to put the film's dated themes into context.

Sindicatos enviaram um ofício hoje (20) ao Ministério Público do Trabalho (MPT) pedindo a criação de uma força tarefa de procuradores para investigação, em âmbito nacional, de denúncias de racismo institucional nas lojas McDonald’s. O documento contém os relatos de 16 ex-funcionários do McDonald’s quer alegam ter sido sistematicamente humilhados e assediados por seus supervisores em casos de discriminação e preconceito racial.
 De acordo com a legislação brasileira, uma empresa que se envolve em racismo estrutural sistêmico comete um crime
 Segundo o ofício, os fatos descritos na denúncia ocorreram em quatro estados nos últimos três anos. A maioria dos trabalhadores era menor de 18 anos na época. Os crimes incluem expressões pejorativas em relação à cor das vítimas e ofensas sobre seus cabelos. Funcionários relataram tersido chamados de “negrinha do cabelo ruim”, “cabelo duro”, “macaca” e “pretinha suja” por seus superiores.
 Uma das profissionais diz que foi impedida de trabalhar durante um evento internacional da rede de fast food por causa da cor da sua pele. Em seu relato ao MPT no Paraná, ela contou que também foram excluídas pessoas gordas e homossexuais do evento. As entidades pedem também a ampliação das investigações já conduzidas pela Procuradoria Regional do Trabalho da 9ª Região, em Curitiba.
 De acordo com o documento, há “fortes indícios da prática de racismo institucional” e os 16 casos apurados até o momento indicam condições indignas de trabalho e negligência na empresa. “Tais práticas podem estar acontecendo em um universo considerável de lojas McDonald´s no Brasil, sem que a empresa adote medidas concretas e efetivas para evitá-las, explicitando-se o descaso e negligência com a situação, para se dizer o mínimo, o que evidencia possível racismo na corporação de ordem organizacional”, relatam as entidades no ofício.
 Além de exigir que a empresa assuma o problema e tome iniciativas para coibir os casos de racismo, os sindicatos solicitam a realização de um censo na empresa para aferir a quantidade de funcionários negros que hoje trabalham na rede, assim como os cargos que ocupam, a renda média, idade e gênero.
 “A empresa deve esclarecer se existem programas de conscientização da questão racial e treinamento dos gerentes para saber lidar com esses problemas no dia a dia”, afirmou Alessandro Vietri, advogado responsável pela queixa. “É essencial que haja um canal de comunicação eficiente e sigiloso para que as vítimas possam denunciar de forma segura. Para acompanhar a questão de perto, com auxílio das centrais sindicais, o MPT deve realizar um trabalho de campo a fim de levantar os números dos trabalhadores que prestam serviço à empresa, com recorte de raça/cor e gênero, possibilitando a criação de um observatório permanente e transparente”, acrescentou.
 De acordo com os sindicatos, somente no Brasil, a empresa McDonald’s emprega cerca de 40 mil pessoas. O ofício foi assinado pela Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT), União Geral dos Trabalhadores (UGT) e Confederação Nacional dos Trabalhadores no Serviço e Comércio (Contracs) e enviado à presidente da Coordenadoria Nacional de Promoção de Igualdade de Oportunidades do MPT de São Paulo.
 Posicionamento   A Arcos Dorados, que opera as franquias de lojas de McDonald's no país, disse, em nota, que não teve acesso ao documento e, portanto, não pode se posicionar sobre a questão. “A Arcos Dorados reitera o seu total compromisso com a promoção de um ambiente de trabalho inclusivo e de respeito. Além disso, a companhia informa que não tolera nenhuma prática de assédio ou discriminação”, diz a nota.
 A empresa informou que promove treinamentos baseados em seu Código de Conduta, para comunicar e conscientizar funcionários sobre seus valores corporativos em relação à diversidade e forma de ser e que mantém um canal de ouvidoria para denúncias, aberto a todos os empregados, além de realizar campanhas de comunicação sobre o tema de diversidade e inclusão.

Wilmington bands Thunderlip, Evening Shadows and Little Gems will perform at local rock club Reggie's 42nd Street Tavern on Friday, July 24.
   
 An audience, however, will not be in attendance. In person, at least. Streamed via Facebook Live, the concert is a benefit show for the Wilmington music venue co-owned by Matt Hearn and Chuck Krueger.
   
 Reggie's has been closed due to the pandemic since mid-March, and Hearn and Krueger have been covering rent and other expenses despite the lack of a steady income. The club has been a staple in the area for nearly 20 years, much like Krueger's long-running rock band, Thunderlip.
   
 As part of Friday night's live stream, the club owners are asking for donations via Venmo (Venmo@Reggies-Merch) in lieu of a cover charge. Evening Shadows is Hearn's new band and Krueger will be pulling double duty with Thunderlip and his new band, Little Gems.
   
 "Matt said there's been several times where Thunderlip has saved Reggie's," Krueger said of his band. "That's why we're doing this. We're the ones that have to pay the bills, but we're not the only ones that love it. People that love it as much as we do, or almost as much as we do, hopefully will pitch in to help keep this together."
   
 It's hard to imagine that Reggie's has been quiet for the last four months. It's long been a go-to place for a mix of genres, especially varied rock and punk bands, and is known for having great live shows. Having to close came as a shock for Krueger and Hearn, they said.
   
 "Huge shock. It's a great gig but it really gets you when it's not. It still doesn't even seem real," Krueger said. "When we first got news of this, we just assumed the best. Four months in, it's started to get really real. We're at a point where, how much debt are we willing to go into? Are we going to be able to dig ourselves out of this?"
   
 It's a harsh reality with ripple effects. The humble, unpretentious location for live music has served the city well, bringing in acts while fostering local bands. I've stood in that comfortably dark and welcoming place so many times, seen so many great shows there, witnessed the impact on new bands interacting with a crowd up close.
   
 "That's the scary thing. This is where bands get started." Krueger said. "It's putting a stall on music on general."
   
 I saw Virgin Lung play there in December 2011, and what a show. When I spoke to guitarist Mike Large afterwards, I was surprised that it was the band's first show. When Virgin Lung ended, Mike and his brother Zach formed Youth League with Jaffar Castillon-Martinez. The band continued to come back to Reggie's long after moving away, bringing great bands to fill the bill when they returned.
   
 "It's so crucial we have spaces like Reggie's survive, especially in smaller cities. It can create a thriving scene in the community," Zach Large said. "Reggie's has helped so many bands, including bands I've played in, whether playing shows or (being) somewhere you need to go and just hang out."
   
 John Bridges moved to Wilmington in 2013. As part of the band Street Clones and co-owner of Mystery School Records, "I quickly found it to be a very open and welcoming place," he said. "Think Cheers if they had metal, punk and country bands, maybe even on the same night. I've seen sold-out, maximum capacity shows (and) 15 people rocking out arm-in-arm on a Tuesday night. Weddings, wakes, baby showers ... Reggie's is like the neighborhood bar of the entire world and we shouldn't take it for granted."

MADRID, July 20 (Reuters) - The prevalence of the novel coronavirus in Spain has risen three-fold over the last three weeks as authorities struggle to contain a rash of fresh clusters, mainly in the Catalonia and Aragon regions, Health Ministry data showed on Monday.
 After registering thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths per day during an early April peak, Spain succeeded in slowing the number of new infections to a trickle.
 But since restrictions on movement were lifted and Spaniards relaxed back into daily life, some 201 new clusters have appeared, with heavy concentrations in and around the Catalan cities of Barcelona and Lleida.
 The occurrence of the novel coronavirus has jumped from eight cases per 100,000 inhabitants at the end of June, when the country's state of emergency ended, to 27 per 100,000, deputy health emergency chief Maria Sierra told a news conference on Monday.
 Over the weekend 4,581 new cases were recorded, bringing the total to 264,836, she added. More than 28,000 people have died.
 "Where measures have been relaxed is where these clusters appear," Health Minister Salvador Illa said. "We're talking about gatherings of extended family and spaces associated with nightlife."
 Describing the situation in Catalonia as concerning, he appealed to residents to respect health measures.
 On Friday the Catalan regional government urged some four million people, including residents of Spain's second largest city Barcelona, to stay at home and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. It also told bars and restaurants to reduce their capacity.
 That was in addition to ordering the mandatory confinement of at least 160,000 people around Lleida.
 To try to prevent similar outbreaks, most Spanish regions have made face masks compulsory even when social-distancing can be guaranteed, going further than a national directive. (Reporting by Nathan Allen; editing by Joan Faus and Barbara Lewis)

One EU official close to the talks said that we are as good as there.
 A diplomat from a big EU nation said the major issues had been dealt with, but that some member states were looking for final small concessions in the 7-year budget. A diplomat from another nation concurred but said such issues could still take a few hours.
 All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were still ongoing. An extraordinary situation demands extraordinary efforts," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said as the leaders pushed on with one of the bloc's longest summits ever.
 What was planned as a two-day summit scheduled to end Saturday was forced into two extra days by deep ideological differences among the 27 leaders. Overall, spirits were high early Tuesday since the talks hit rock bottom Sunday night.
 Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, defending the cause of a group of five wealthy northern nations -- the Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark -- was on the brink of securing limits to costs and imposing strict reform guarantees on any rescue plan for needy nations.
 It was the focal point of the marathon talks that started on Friday morning.

Both women arrogantly walked to the ring and as they did, the announce team debated whether or not Banks as really champion after last night. Once they got into the ring, Bayley told the audience to show respect to the new Raw Women's Champion in Sasha Banks. Banks then spoke. She said that a lot of people talked about her and accused her of stealing the championship. She said last night she fought for the title whereas Asuka was just handed it. Banks said that Becky Lynch handed Asuka the title and that the people were forgetting that. She said that Asuka almost blinded the referee with the green mist and that Bayley borrowed the refs shirt because someone needed to officiate the match. Bayley then chimed in and said she had to make a choice and do the right thing. Sasha said that nobody needs to get it because she is the Boss and is two belts Banks. From there, they said they owned all the gold and celebrated in the ring.   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The NHL suspended New York Rangers forward Brendan Lemieux for two games on Monday for an interference infraction that happened on March 11.
 Lemieux will miss the first two games of the Rangers' qualifying series against the Carolina Hurricanes, scheduled for Aug. 1 and Aug. 3.
 Lemieux hit Colorado Avalanche forward Joonas Donskoi up high with his shoulder, causing Donskoi to leave the game. The Rangers' 3-2 overtime loss in Denver was their last game before the COVID-19 pandemic halted the season.
 The NHL Department of Player Safety said Lemieux would be allowed to play in the Rangers' exhibition game on July 29 against the New York Islanders in Toronto.
 Lemieux, 24, tallied six goals and 12 assists in 59 games during the regular season. He led New York with 111 penalty minutes.

Adds additional Thune, Mnuchin comments)
 By Susan Cornwell and David Morgan
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Advisers to President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats were set to discuss the next steps in responding to the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday, with congressional Republicans saying they were working on a $1 trillion relief bill.
 In a meeting on Monday at the White House, Republican lawmakers and administration officials said they were making progress toward fresh legislation aimed at cushioning the heavy economic toll of the pandemic.
 "Senate Republicans will put forward our proposal soon, I hope our Democratic colleagues will be ready to work together," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who hopes to unveil the proposal this week.
 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will host a meeting on Tuesday to discuss coronavirus relief with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a source familiar with the matter said.
 The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Republican proposal would include a cut to the payroll tax on workers' gross earnings, which funds national retirement programs. Trump backs such a cut as an economic stimulus, but the idea has stirred little enthusiasm among lawmakers, who worry about protecting Social Security payments.
 "We're working and negotiating with the Democrats and trying to get a plan that helps small business, helps people, helps this country," Trump said.
 Mnuchin did not provide details about the bill beyond saying that it included the payroll tax cut. "It's in the bill, so we'll see," he told reporters.
 Schumer warned that Democrats were prepared to stymie any Republican effort to pass partisan legislation. "A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people," he said in a letter to colleagues.
 'NOWHERE NEAR OUT OF THE WOODS'
 Congress has so far committed $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last bill into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million. The virus has killed over 140,000 people in the United States. Both figures lead the world.
 "We are nowhere near out of the woods," McConnell said.
 Mnuchin, who led previous coronavirus bill negotiations with Congress, said he intended to "focus on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will have a big impact."
 But Democrats have pledged to fight for legislation akin to a $3 trillion bill the House approved in mid-May, providing hundreds of billions of dollars for state and local governments, extending enhanced unemployment insurance and providing new payments to individuals and families.
 The prospect for legislation was upstaged over the weekend by reports of White House plans to eliminate funding for testing, drawing opposition from Republicans as well as Democrats.
 "I'm for whatever it takes to get enough tests out there to safely open up schools and other aspects of our economy," Senator John Thune, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, told reporters.

ATHENS, Ga. -- JT Daniels and his position coach from his freshman season at Southern Cal talked by phone a couple of times after the quarterback entered the transfer portal in mid-April.
   
 Not so much about reuniting at Western Kentucky, where Bryan Ellis now is offensive coordinator. The conversations, Ellis said, were more along the lines of how Daniels was doing before he made a major move in his football career.
   
 Daniels still wanted to pick the brain of his former coach.
   
 "Out of the blue one day, he sent me a text message and wanted to know exactly what all the back end of a defense is doing in a certain coverage," Ellis said. "I'm like, 'Where in the heck is this coming from?' He's a football junkie in a good way. He's really smart, he's really cerebral. He does a lot of things really, really good."
   
 Daniels' new Georgia football teammates and the Bulldogs coaching staff this summer will get a chance to see the attributes he can offer the program. They include a constant quest to better understand the game, fearlessness and toughness, Ellis said.
   
 "His unique trait I believe, and I think every quarterback has to have one to survive, is his mind," said Yogi Roth, an analyst for the Pac-12 Network who is tied into the USC program as a former staff member who worked with the quarterbacks when Steve Sarkisian was offensive coordinator. "He's not Lamar Jackson as an athlete. He doesn't have an Aaron Rodgers type arm but he's way above average in everything, but his unique trait that makes him special is between his ears."
   
 Roth considers himself tight with Daniels going back to when he was a five- star recruit out of Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif. Roth was on the call when Daniels became just the second Trojans quarterback to start a season opener as a freshman, joining Matt Barkley in 2009. He kept in touch with Daniels when he ultimately decided to transfer to Georgia.
   
 "This isn't about him leaving USC because he wasn't happy. This is about 'I just want to play,'" Roth said. "He's not going to come in with rose-colored glasses and kind of anticipating people to hand him the world. He's going to come in knowing that he's going to have to work."
   
 Daniels arrived at USC in the summer of 2018 after reclassifying following his junior season, but managed to win the starting job months later.
   
 "I thought he really made great strides as the season went along," Ellis said. "We tend to forget the kid was really a high school senior starting at USC. There were definitely growing pains, there were definitely struggles. I don't think all that was necessarily his fault. You go from Sam Darnold, who was a second-year starter and the third pick in the draft. We lost a couple of really good wideouts. It was a different team."
   
 Daniels threw for 2,672 yards with 14 touchdowns and 10 interceptions while ranking 71st nationally in passing efficiency. He set a USC record with 37 completions against Notre Dame.
   
 "I watched every single snap that JT's taken in college and a lot of practices," said Roth, who lives in Los Angeles. "I think when you sit back and evaluate his freshman campaign and then his offseason, you have to look at it with realistic eyes.
   
 "He graduated high school early and he went to a place where I always say when you sign at USC and become a household name and when you start, you become a Heisman candidate. There's really not another place that it's like USC in the country at quarterback. Every place has their element of success, but you look at the longevity and history of playing quarterback in LA and USC, it's just different. It's different than Georgia, it's different than Bama, than Oklahoma, it's just different."
   
 USC has produced eight quarterbacks drafted since 2003, including four first- rounders in Darnold, Mark Sanchez, Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer.
   
 That brings plenty of hype and pressure to playing the position.
   
 Georgia has a seemingly stocked quarterback room now with five scholarship players led by Wake Forest graduate transfer Jamie Newman. Daniels departed USC where Kedon Slovis became a freshman All-American after stepping into the starting role when Daniels tore knee ligaments in the season opener last year and was sidelined for the season.
   
 In the opener before his injury in the first half, Daniels completed 24 of 34 passes for 215 yards with a touchdown and interception.
   
 Daniels missed out on having a chance to shine in a new "Air Raid" offense run by first-year coordinator Graham Harrell, who played for Mike Leach at Texas Tech and coached under him at Washington State. New offensive coordinator Todd Monken is from the "Air Raid" tree from his days as Oklahoma State's offensive coordinator.
   
 Roth said he expects Monken to run a pro-style system with Air Raid principles. Daniels isn't the run threat that Newman is, but Ellis said "he's plenty athletic. Coach Monken will figure out what JT can do well and make that work for him."

Debemos combatir la actitud inadmisible de algunas personas, pocas, que nos ponen en peligro a todos. Hemos visto este fin de semana cierta laxitud a la hora de mantener las medidas de seguridad y el lamentable ejemplo de algunos locales de ocio nocturno», sentencio el consejero.
 Si se podran mantener abiertas las terrazas en las que los clientes esten sentados, indico Villegas, por lo que «los locales de ocio nocturno o se reconvierten en terrazas o en caferias o tendran que cerrar». Ademas, se ha limitado a un maximo de 15 personas las que podran estar reunidas, ya sea en eventos privados o publicos.
 Salud detallo que esta limitacion, que antes se cifraba en 30 personas, se refiere exclusivamente a reuniones sociales, familiares o de grupos en terrazas. En cuanto a los aforos en bodas y restaurantes, estos se siguen rigiendo por las normas establecidas en el BORM del 19 de junio.
 Por otra parte, se limitaran las visitas de familiares en las residencias de Murcia, Totana y Cieza. En los dos ultimos municipios se cerraran tambien los centros de dia.
 El consejero explico que actualmente «no hay ningun caso en residencias, pero es un sitio de muchisima vulnerabilidad». Es una medida preventiva, afirmo Villegas, «hay que proteger a esa poblacion». En estos momentos, el brote de Atalayas es el que mas preocupa a Salud. Ya se han detectado 40 positivos de este brote. Hasta 900 personas de las que estuvieron en alguno de los locales de la zona han acudido a realizarse las pruebas PCR como respuesta a la convocatoria de las instancias sanitarias.
 Villegas reitero el llamamiento a todas las personas que en el mes de julio han salido de fiesta por esa zona, o han estado en el local tambien cerrado en Totana, que acumula tres contagios, a que pidan una cita por telefono o Internet para someterse a la prueba PCR.
 El incumplimiento de la cuarentena es otra de las cuestiones que mas inquieta al Gobierno regional. «Tenemos dificultad para que la gente entienda lo que significa una cuarentena», se lamento Villegas. Insistio en que cualquier persona que haya sido contacto estrecho de un positivo, «se haga o no se haga la PCR, salga como salga, si el sistema sanitario le dice que tiene que hacer cuarentena, tiene que hacer cuarentena», sentencio.
 Que un test resulte negativo no quiere decir que esta persona no se haya contagiado. «Parece que hay una sensacion de libertad cuando a un contacto estrecho de un contagiado le hacen una PCR y sale negativo. Si el medico le esta diciendo que guarde cuarentena es porque existe la posibilidad de que esa PCR sea positiva en unos dias y la persona pueda contagiar al resto de familiares y a las personas con las que convive», explico.
 Villegas afirma que una medida que ayudaria a realizar el seguimiento de casos es que en los bares se identifique a las personas que acuden. En algunos establecimientos lo estan haciendo mediante un lector QR para el movil. «A nosotros esto nos vendria muy bien mientras no tengamos la aplicacion que estan estando a nivel nacional y que estara seguramente para septiembre. Cuando tengamos la aplicacion eso no sera necesario porque directamente la aplicacion la que informe a los contactos estrechos», expreso.  
 ## Contagio en el Reina Sofia
 Por otra parte, fuentes del personal sanitario del Hospital Reina Sofia informaron ayer a La OPINIÓN de un nuevo positivo en el centro. Estas fuentes se quejan de que solo se hicieron las pruebas PCR a dos de los 15 sanitarios que estuvieron en contacto con el paciente contagiado por coronavirus.
 Por su parte, la Consejeria de Salud indica que «el servicio de riesgos laborales del hospital Reina Sofia, coordinado con Salud Publica, realizo la encuesta reglada a todos los trabajadores que podrian haber estado en contacto con el paciente afectado y, una vez medido el riesgo, se determino que era bajo, salvo en los dos casos a los que se ha pedido la prueba PCR».
 Precisan que «no es Medicina Preventiva el responsable de ese protocolo, ya que este servicio atiende los casos de pacientes, mientras que Riesgos Laborales se encarga de actuar cuando se trata de profesionales del centro hospitalario».

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s hot spot Victoria state on Tuesday reported 374 new cases of COVID-19, its second-highest daily tally.
 Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews also announced three more deaths, bringing the national death toll 126.
 Andrews said a lockdown in Australia’s second-largest city Melbourne, which began two weeks ago, was having an impact.
 “You’d like to see numbers coming down. At the end of the day though, we’re not seeing the doubling and doubling again” of cases, Andrews said. “So what that says to me … is that the sorts of measures we’ve put in place are having a direct impact.”
 Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said military personnel were helping Victorian health authorities deal with the growing caseload.
 “We’re still very much in the hard part of this fight, as you can see from the daily case numbers and I’m not expecting that to change a lot in the short term,” Morrison said. “And we just need to keep working the problem.”

Once Seth got to the ring, he paused to soak in the boos and chants of "shame," but then spoke. First, he said that at Extreme Rules last night, Rey Mysterio's eye came out of its socket. He then said that he wanted to be honest. He said he understood what the eye for an eye stipulation entailed, but that what happened in his match last night would stay with him for the rest of his life. He said that the visual image of Rey holding his bloody eye in his hand will stay in his memories forever. Rollins said that picture was disgusting, barbaric, and more than he expected. He said that image made him sick to his stomach both figuratively and literally. Rollins said that he had been asked whether he regrets the match or not. Instead of answering it, he asked the fans whether or not they regret it because they made him what he is. Rollins then blamed Rey Mysterio for asking for the eye for an eye match in the first place and said that actions have consequences to them. Rollins said that what happened to Rey was unfortunate, but that we couldn't afford to dwell in the past. Rollins said the beauty of all of this is that Rey Mysterio is out of sight. Because of that, Seth said that Raw can now fulfill its potential and be the greater good as promised. Before he could finish, Aleister Black walked out.

Recasts with fresh quotes, details from White House meeting)
 By David Morgan and Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers in Congress laid out their priorities for new coronavirus legislation on Monday, while Democrats warned that any partisan Republican measure would be met by unified opposition.
 In a meeting at the White House, Republican legislators and administration officials said they were making progress toward a $1 trillion legislative package focusing on businesses, schools and healthcare.
 "If you're looking for a theme here, it's livelihood protection for those who are trying to deal with the pandemic -- people already struggling to keep kids in school, jobs and healthcare," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters in the Oval Office.
 The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 McConnell is expected to unveil legislation in coming days, and Trump told reporters there has been "a lot of progress" toward a bill. "We're working and negotiating with the Democrats and trying to get a plan that helps small business, helps people, helps this country," Trump said.
 But McConnell has yet to engage in bipartisan negotiations, a Senate Democratic aide said.
 Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party was prepared to stymie any effort by Republicans to bring partisan legislation to the floor of the chamber. Similar partisan standoffs preceded the last coronavirus bills.
 "We will stand together again if we must," Schumer said in a letter to his Democratic colleagues. "A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people."
 Congress has so far passed legislation committing $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last response into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million.
 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who led previous coronavirus bill negotiations with Congress, said on Monday that he intended to "focus on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will have a big impact."
 But Democrats have pledged to fight for legislation akin to the $3 trillion bill that the House approved in mid-May, which provides hundreds of billions of dollars in assistance for state and local governments, extends enhanced unemployment insurance and provides new direct payments to individuals and families.
 The prospect for new legislation was upstaged over the weekend by White House efforts to eliminate billion of dollars of money intended for testing and tracing, in a bid to gain control of the virus's spread. Word of the move has sparked anger among Democrats and Republicans alike.
 "That goes beyond ignorance. It's just beyond the pale. Hopefully, it was a mistake and they'll back off it, because it is so very wrong," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC.

 This year has been one of the most challenging years we've ever faced. The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on far too many. Tough choices are being made in homes across the Austin region. Job creators are striving to keep their business open and employees on payroll as unemployment has skyrocketed and economic uncertainty has mounted. Elected officials are making difficult choices as we withstand the onslaught of the pandemic and accompanying economic downturn -- all while awaiting a breakthrough on a vaccine or therapeutic treatments for COVID-19.
 Despite this harsh reality, we have an opportunity to recover, and housing can lead the way. Mortgage rates have hit historic lows, and demand among homebuyers remains strong, despite an uncertain future. Following weeks of sheltering in place, annual home sales across the region dipped a mere 5% year to date, demonstrating the perseverance of our market. Those good signs could be wasted, however, if our elected officials don't make deliberate efforts to slow the burden of property taxes.
 The Austin Board of Realtors, on behalf of the property owners across the city and region, is asking the Austin City Council, and municipal governments across Central Texas, to make a difficult choice for the long-term benefit: Hold the line on the draft budget, which is balanced and limits the property revenue increase to 3.5% as prescribed by Senate Bill 2. We understand that given emergency declarations to combat the pandemic, municipal governments have the authority to raise taxes beyond that amount without voter approval. However, we're looking to our elected officials to lead with a focus on empathy for everyone impacted by COVID-19 and on our economic recovery.
 Housing is the most crucial infrastructure we have. Just look at how the meaning of \"home\" has changed as it has become our refuge under the siege of COVID-19. Keeping Austinites in their homes and making homeownership accessible to help lead the economic recovery can be done only if we continually pass policies and budgets that enable a more affordable Austin today and tomorrow.
 Austin's market is aggressively moving forward and every month, more people are being priced out of it. From January to June of this year, the median home price in Austin has spiked over 9% to $406,000. And while six months of housing capacity is what the Texas A&M; Real Estate Center deems a balanced market, Austin remains at 1.6 months of inventory, which is dangerously low.
 If we stay on the path of increasingly higher taxes and declining inventory, amid economic uncertainty -- all while people look to move here in search of opportunity -- we risk an out of control and overpriced market while losing the character of a community built for all Austinites.
 The governmental response to this crisis must remain about the health, safety and economic stability of the people of Central Texas. This is not the time for the expansion of government or a massive hike on property taxes. Those actions would negatively impact the finances of families across the region and hurt our ability to attract new jobs in order to recover losses caused by the pandemic. Many of the well thought out plans we have to improve our city and region must be put on hold. We cannot afford for a plan that is strong on its merits to create economic mandates that place too much of a burden on property owners who are already under immense strain. It is more prudent to wait until economic confidence, and thereby voter confidence, has improved.
 This will not be easy, but we look to our leaders, especially during unprecedented times, to make difficult choices in the interest of the public good.

Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who helped create a police force in postwar Iraq, wrote this morning that he insisted that Iraqi officers wear police uniforms, not camouflage. He wanted to highlight three distinctions by doing so. Police keep the peace and aim to defuse conflict; soldiers aim to intimidate and to prosecute conflict to victory. Police need to be visible, as their presence alone can deter confrontation and crime; soldiers aim to be invisible and blend into their surroundings, to more effectively confront the enemy. Police need to be trained to be accountable because they often work alone or in pairs and can get away more easily with misconduct; soldiers work as part of a team within a rigid hierarchy and are watched at most times. Re-watch the video of the feds versus Christopher David. Which model seems closer to how they approached him?

In 1934, the Production Code Administration was created within the MPAA. Its sole purpose was to enforce the rules laid out in the Code and make it nearly impossible for a film to ignore it. MPAA members, who were made up of every studio head from the major studios in Hollywood, agreed "not to produce or distribute pictures which did not bear the PCA seal of approval." They were now required to submit story ideas, scripts, and final cuts of their movies for review. The PCA could request edits and cuts at any point in production.

Remarkably enough, the restrictive Code didn't prevent movies from being censored _even more so_ upon release. Local censor boards were still in effect across the country, and they continued to ban movies even if they had the PCA seal of approval.

Adds McConnell, McCarthy comments)
 By David Morgan and Steve Holland
 WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans on Monday said they were working on a $1 trillion coronavirus relief bill focused on businesses, schools and healthcare, while Democrats vowed to oppose any proposal developed without bipartisan talks.
 In a meeting at the White House, Republican legislators and administration officials said they were making progress toward a fresh round of legislation aimed at cushioning the heavy economic toll of the pandemic.
 "Senate Republicans will put forward our proposal soon, I hope our Democratic colleagues will be ready to work together," said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, adding that he hoped to unveil the proposal this week.
 The Republican-controlled Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives have less than two weeks to hammer out a new relief package before enhanced unemployment benefits run out for tens of millions of American workers made jobless by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Monday said the upcoming Republican proposal would include a cut to the payroll tax on workers' gross earnings, which funds national retirement programs. Trump favors such a cut as an economic stimulus, but the idea has stirred little enthusiasm on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers worried about protecting the Social Security payments funded by payroll taxes.
 "We're working and negotiating with the Democrats and trying to get a plan that helps small business, helps people, helps this country," Trump said.
 But McConnell has yet to engage in bipartisan negotiations, a Senate Democratic aide said.
 Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned that his party was prepared to stymie any Republican effort to pass partisan legislation. "A bipartisan, bicameral process will result in a much better bill for the American people," he said in a letter to colleagues.
 Congress has so far committed $3 trillion to the crisis. In the more than 12 weeks since Trump signed the last bill into law, the number of U.S. coronavirus cases has more than tripled to over 3.7 million.
 McConnell said recent spikes in new cases "show that we are nowhere near out of the woods."
 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who led previous coronavirus bill negotiations with Congress, said on Monday that he intended to "focus on starting with another trillion dollars. We think that will have a big impact."
 But Democrats have pledged to fight for legislation akin to the $3 trillion bill that the House approved in mid-May, which provides hundreds of billions of dollars for state and local governments, extends enhanced unemployment insurance and provides new payments to individuals and families.

 Reed said while the change will take some getting used to, removing the traffic lights will be better for traffic flow on Washington Avenue in the long run.
 “It will also enable us to queue up traffic for longer distances and it won’t overlap between intersections,” Reed said. “It’s not very far between one intersection to the next, it’s just kind of how the downtown is laid out.

The urbane and well-spoken Julian Bond seemed the obvious choice to succeed the dapper Wyche Fowler, not the more countrified Lewis. Fowler had roundly defeated Lewis to win the seat in 1977, and had spent the intervening years on the Atlanta City Council, picking fights with important people. Bond narrowly missed winning the election without a runoff, polling 47 percent, 12 points ahead of Lewis. In a stunning upset, Lewis won the runoff with 52 percent of the vote.

As per _Dawn_ , this application reads that _" The state as per instructions of the provincial government with reference to the prevailing situation, intend to withdraw prosecution of the subject case.”_ Whereas this move has being seen as a confidence building measure to resolve the existing deadlock between the government and PTM, but the truth is more pedestrian. It was just to escape international criticism and public censure for the indiscriminate firing that killed, maimed and injured nearly 50 unarmed protesters that ISPR spun the wobbly yarn in defence of the army, of the checkpost coming under fire from protesters forcing soldiers to fire back, about five soldiers being injured due to firing by PTM activists, and one of the soldier even succumbing to his injuries.

During other times of the year, Williamson often has anti-abortion signs in front of his office. Williamson, who describes himself as to the right of Mother Theresa when it comes to being anti-abortion, supports Donald Trump for the same reason.
 Unlike in the past, Williamson now has cameras and photos of the people who have been committing the vandalism. The vandals wrote crude images on the sign in instance and knocked the it down in another.
 “It was two guys the first time, with blue hoodies and germ masks on. It took them about five seconds. They walked up walked up Lawrence Road, they both had spray paint, they both defaced it with spray paint in about three seconds and ran up Eagle Road,” said Williamson, describing the video. “The second time, two girls parked in the pizza shop across the street. They came over and tried to knock it down but were unable to do it. Then two boys came from the same direction, I think they were on a date together, they knocked it down. I still have their footprints on the back of the sign.”
 The vandals graffitied, crude images on the sign in instance and knocked the it down in another.
 Williamson, who has run unsuccessfully for the state Legislature in the 166th District, said he was not frustrated by the vandalism and he believes having the sign is well worth it.
 “I’m not frustrated at all, I’ve had 12 people call me up and offer to pay for a new sign. One person dropped off $200 cash to buy a new sign,” said Williamson. “I had two liberal Democrats call me up and apologize for destruction to the sign. So I’m not frustrated at all. When I stand in front of that sign, fixing it or something, I get so many positive comments that it is well worth it. It will be constantly replaced.”

The nation’s largest red state is fast on the verge of becoming the nation’s largest swing state. At least a half dozen congressional seats are up for grabs in Texas. Democrats are threatening to take control of the Statehouse. Sen. John Cornyn’s poll numbers haven’t quite collapsed, but a recent survey put Joe Biden up five points over President Trump in the state. After Beto O’Rourke and the Democratic wave drove historic midterm turnout in Texas in 2018, conservative donors launched a voter registration drive to find new Republican voters. It shuttered this spring. After decades of ever-increasing dominance, the party is finally coming face to face with its own limitations.

 “Just throw strikes and trust your defense,” Collins said. “That’s just doing your job.”
 A rising senior at Abingdon High School, Collins struck out four and the only hits the Patriots (4-6-1) managed were singles from Tyson Mitchell and Corbin Dickenson.
 “Caleb did a great job of attacking the zone,” said A-Town Falcons coach Andrew Francisco. “We were hoping to get two to three innings out of him, but once he settled in we decided to let him ride it out. Really proud of the way he competed.”
 Collins got double-play groundouts to end both the fifth and sixth innings.

Reconsider wetlands park
   
 The Gainesville Regional Utilities wetlands park planned for Parker Road needs careful re-analysis. Its need is determined by GRU. Its site is being purchased by GRU on a noncompetitive basis. Its design is in-house. No environmental impact statement has been filed.
   
 It is contiguous to a sports park's outfield and illuminated at night by stadium lights. It is right across the road from the now under-construction new elementary school (and has the School Board been asked for input?). It is also right across from a new housing development.
   
 It will attract alligators, snakes and insects. And it costs $4 million plus annual upkeep at a time when many are demonstrating for more social services, better educational facilities, improved health care and a change in the composition of law enforcement.

 Demilitarize the police
   
 About 10 years ago when my daughter was a newborn, the Gainesville Police Department was using its helicopter excessively. Every night at 10 p.m. the helicopter would circle my neighborhood, waking up my newborn. It wasn't criminals perpetrating crimes every night, it was training runs. People complained and they stopped.
   
 Here we are 10 years later and it's started again. Only this time it is all day long. This is a small (even insignificant) part of what people are talking about when they demand we defund the police. If GPD/the Alachua County Sheriff's Office has the money to keep a helicopter in the sky almost incessantly, we can certainly divert that money to more dire needs in east Gainesville.
   
 If there are concrete reasons to have constant helicopter flights in Gainesville, please explain. I have an open mind, but they have a heavy lift ahead of them. We need to end the hypermilitarization of local police.

 Kowtowing to a bully
   
 Watching events unfold around the proposed reopening of schools has been difficult to say the least. Different counties have different plans, there is no unified decision-making process and parents face difficult decisions they shouldn't have to be making for their children.
   
 This all goes back to Donald Trump's demand that schools fully reopen in the fall. He even threatened to hold educational funding hostage and bullied our teachers, the people who spend their lives trying in the face of many great challenges to educate our children for very little money.
   
 It is sadly almost as appalling to see our local school leaders having such a consistently lazy approach, kowtowing to the demands of a bully, showing little to no regard for the safety of our teachers and students, simply throwing together a weakly conceived plan with few options and telling parents they have a short timeline to choose between a few bad options.

 No longer a leader
   
 America used to be the "leader of the free world." We were the lead member of NATO and highly respected among the vast majority of the nations of the world. We co-existed with Russia and, although we made overtures to North Korea, nothing came of them.
   
 Trump is elected and very quickly touts major advances with North Korea and China. He has a "bromance" with Vladimir Putin and Russia can do and does no wrong. Three years after Trump's election, we're back to square one with North Korea and China, having made no advances with either!
   
 Russia and the U.S. still co-exist, but Russia is now paying rewards on the lives of our servicemen. Trump does nothing! America has withdrawn from the World Health organization and (for the most part) NATO. Now France, Germany and Canada are leading NATO.
   
 America is a joke around the world, mimicking the worst of the third-world countries.

JERUSALEM, July 20 (Reuters) - Israel's parliament voted on Monday to allow the country's domestic intelligence agency to track the cellphones of coronavirus carriers for the rest of the year amid a resurgence in new cases.
 The Shin Bet's surveillance technology has been used on and off to track carriers since March, and the Knesset in a late- night decision approved the measure through Jan. 20, 2021, the Knesset news agency reported.
 The security agency tracks location data of confirmed carriers for 14 days before they were diagnosed. That data is used to identify anyone with whom they came into contact, which proponents say is crucial to infection chains.
 The surveillance has drawn challenges from privacy watchdog groups, and the Supreme Court cited worries over dangers to individual liberty in demanding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government regulate the surveillance through legislation.
 The new law includes additional oversight, requiring the government to renew its request every three weeks, and it can be used only when new daily cases exceed 200. Those ordered into isolation can appeal if they believe the data was inaccurate.
 The Knesset also instructed the Health Ministry to roll out an upgraded cell phone app that can be downloaded by the public to help track infection.
 Israel reopened schools and many businesses in May, lifting restrictions that had flattened the infection curve after a partial lockdown imposed in March.
 But a second-wave surge has many public health experts saying the government moved too quickly while neglecting to take the necessary epidemiological steps to control the pandemic once the economy reopened.
 Israel, with a population of 9 million, reported about 1,500 new infections on Monday. In total it has reported 415 deaths from the virus. (Reporting by Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Dan Grebler)

From there, Bayley put Sane in an arm submission and lifted her in the air to increase the pain. Sane broke free due to a well placed elbow. After, she hit Bayley with a double stomp and covered, but only got a two count. In the end, Sane connected with the Insane Elbow, but couldn't cover right away due to her injured elbow. Eventually, she got there, but only got a two count because Bayley put her foot on the ropes to break the pin. Out of the pin, Bayley hit Sane with a knee and followed that with her own top rope elbow before covering for a two count. Out of the pin, Bayley went for the Bayley to Belly. Sane countered into a pin for the 1,2,3 win.

Two, it was a brazen attempt by locals to (again in ISPR’s words) “exert pressure for release of suspected terrorists’ facilitator” who had been arrested a day earlier from Doga Macha Madakhel village after an encounter between Pakistan army and suspected terrorists, during which one soldier was injured (More about him later).Three, the mob was led by two serving legislators, Ali Wazir and Mohsin Javed Dawar who are Members of National Assembly (MNA), and lastly, (as per ISPR), the mob resorted to “direct firing on the post.”

“I’m optimistic about sports happening in the fall,” Mountain Pointe Athletic Director Aaron Frana said. “Our student-athletes need sports to give them some sort of normalcy.”
 Several of Mountain Pointe’s athletic programs decided against holding summer workouts despite being given the green light to do so on June 15. The football program began field workouts while the cross country program participated in daily runs.
 Badminton did not conduct workouts. The volleyball program also decided against a summer camp until the second phase. Cheer, which is a year-round sport, only had two conditioning workouts on campus before Tempe Union schools shut down camps the week of July 4.
 “Our volleyball program decided to wait until they can get bigger groups in the gym,” Frana said. “I’m a positive guy so I’m hopeful to be able to allow them all back on campus on the 20th. Fingers crossed.”
 Desert Vista’s athletic teams took a slightly different approach.
 Football was the only school team practicing on campus. School Athletic Director Tommy Eubanks said volleyball, baseball and softball had considered conducting camps but decided to not go forward with plans so players could stick to their respective clubs.
 “Cross country did stuff on their own and volleyball thought with the restrictions it didn’t make a lot of sense for them to come in,” Eubanks said. “We are being strict with what they are allowed to do. And it would be the same if we are able to return on the 20th.”
 Eubanks, like many others, is currently in wait-and-see mode in regard to fall sports taking place. While he is hopeful, he also understands it depends entirely on the status of the state’s fight against the virus.
 “People ask me how I feel and what I think, and I always say they’ll know when I know,” Eubanks said. “We can’t even move into phase two until the governor does and honestly, I don’t know when that will happen.”
 Like most districts, Tempe Union will give students the option to attend school in-person, online or a combination of the two. Ultimately, it’s up to the parents and students to decide whether they feel comfortable attending school in person should schools be able to open.
 The AIA allows students to complete online schoolwork as long as it is registered through a district and one of its respective schools and compete on an athletic team. Executive Director David Hines said that will remain the case this year if students choose to only conduct online coursework.
 “Kids taking virtual classes through a third-person, Primavera type are not eligible,” Hines said. “If the governor says we can go back to in-person school, regardless if a kid decides to stay online, go in-person or do a combination of the two, they are eligible at that school.
 “For example, if a kid takes online classes through the Mesa district and some are through Mountain View, they are eligible to compete for Mountain View.”
 Several other East Valley schools are grappling with the same challenges as Tempe Union.
 Chandler Unified School District’s return-to-play plan called for four nine- day phases that would eventually allow teams to practice without limitations. Chandler teams should currently be entering the fourth and final phase, which involved playing other teams in traditional 7-on-7 tournaments.
 But schools never made it out of the first phase. The morning of its scheduled transition to the second phase, teams were told to essentially press pause on any advancements.
 “It was a combination of guidance from the district and our own decision,” Hamilton Athletic Director Brett Palmer said in regard to not moving into the second phase. “We want to do what is best for our athletes.”
 Palmer said the Chandler district allowed teams to begin workouts again on Monday, July 13.
 Football, volleyball, boys and girls basketball and cheer all began workouts at Hamilton this summer. Though most have already decided not to return when given the green light by district and school officials.
 Palmer reflected on the possibility of sports not taking place in the fall, explaining his desire to allow athletes to play if it is deemed safe to do so.

 The Democratic leaders said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday that they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a “concerted foreign interference campaign” to influence the 2020 presidential election. They asked Wray for an all-members, classified briefing on the matter before the August recess.
 The letter from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and the top Democrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees contains no details about the threats, though they describe them as serious and specific.
 “We are gravely concerned, in particular, that Congress appears to be the target of a concerted foreign interference campaign, which seeks to launder and amplify disinformation in order to influence congressional activity, public debate, and the presidential election in November,” wrote Pelosi, Schumer, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence panel.
 A congressional official familiar with the letter said that there was a classified addendum “to ensure a clear and unambiguous record of the counterintelligence threats of concern.” The person, who was granted anonymity to describe the confidential letter, said the addendum largely draws from the executive branch’s own reporting and analysis.
 The FBI said it had received the letter but declined further comment.
 While the Democrats' exact concerns were unclear, there have been worries since Trump was elected that Russia's efforts to sow American chaos are ongoing in the 2020 election. The 2016 effort included hacking of Democratic email accounts during the campaign by Russian military intelligence officials and the subsequent disclosure by WikiLeaks.

He said those were important moments, but not the moment that he believes changed his life. He said that the moment he was talking about was the moment he crushed Edge with a steel chair. He said that after that, he realized that all of his friendships were over with. He said that moment means sadness for others, but that it gave him satisfaction. He said he felt great to stand over Edge as he convulsed. He said he felt satisfied when he ruined Christian as well. Orton then said that tonight he would enjoy punt kicking Big Show in the head and ending his career once and for all.   *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

An increase in the general demand for money, let us say on account of a general increase in the production of goods, doesn’t imply that individuals sit on the money and do nothing with it. The key reason an individual has a demand for money is in order to be able to exchange it for other goods and services.

"I stubbed my toe two years ago," he recalled. "I went to the doctor because I gotta Ye everything up… When I got there, five doctors asked me if I wanted pain medication. At the end of the year they give out awards to the people who have given out the most medication. After getting plastic surgery, that was a slippery slope to getting addicted to Percocets – a cousin and sister to heroin. I was addicted to a smaller form of heroin. I would live in this McMansion, in this gated community… and I would drive to Calabasas, high as a motherfucker."

Traffic lights on Washington Avenue at Seventh and 12th streets have been replaced by stop signs, and the stops will disappear when the project to turn the road two-way begins this fall.
 Waco’s traffic and streets divisions began removing the lights July 17, as a precursor to the Washington Avenue two-way conversion, which has been in the works since 2018. The stop signs will eventually be phased out, but the road will remain one-way until construction is complete. Jim Reed, city of Waco capital improvement program manager, said the stop signs are less jarring for drivers than removing the stop lights with no warning.
 “We’re just trying to give people enough notice, so they don’t potentially run a signal if it goes into flash mode or something like that,” Reed said.

 The NFL's testing will run through a national laboratory company. The league spoke with the CDC; the White House task force; a number of public health officials; infectious disease experts and national laboratory medicine leaders to make sure its testing protocol would not have a negative impact on the country's testing supply or the health care system.
 "We've received unanimous response across the board that it would not have a negative impact," Sills said. "That's a very important point to us, we take that responsibility very seriously. We've also discussed that at length with our testing vendor to make sure we are not having a negative impact on any of their business."
