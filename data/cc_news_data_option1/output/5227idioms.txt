Monday‚Äôs directive from the California Department of Public Health shutting down youth and high school sports until late January was a gut punch, a finger in the eye, an anvil dropped on a foot to high school administrators, coaches and athletes.
 In a nutshell, the announcement hurt, leaving people to wonder if sports will be played at all in this academic year as COVID-19 numbers continue to climb in California.
 The CDPH said prep sports would not begin until Jan. 25 at the earliest, although the return-to-competition date will be reassessed by Jan. 4.
 ‚ÄúAt this point, we‚Äôre evaluating everything and hoping for changes,‚Äù said Joe Heinz, commissioner of the CIF San Diego Section. ‚ÄúThe CDPH could change before Jan. 4.
 ‚ÄúThe bottom line is people need to realize we‚Äôre all trying to do what‚Äôs best for kids, communities and schools.
 ‚ÄúAlso, people need to realize the CDPH is the decision-maker here, not the CIF. The decisions on when to start play is 100 percent out of our control.‚Äù
 Heinz has held meetings with athletic directors, coaches, officials and San Diego‚Äôs conference presidents.
 Ron Nocetti, the CIF state executive director, plans to talk with Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs office about possible changes to the CDPH guidelines.
 Nocetti said while Monday‚Äôs announcement was bad news, it was good to get updated guidance.
 ‚ÄúNow we have to advocate for our students,‚Äù he said.
 Nocetti plans to champion for more sports in the second-least restrictive orange tier in hopes of opening the door.
 After this weekend, 32 states will have concluded a football season, complete with state championships. The Texas state championships are set for Jan. 14-16.
 ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the pause button is still in place in some areas of the country,‚Äù said Dr. Karissa Niehoff, executive director of the National Federation of State High school Sports Associations (NFHS).
 ‚ÄúGovernment, education and health leaders in some states have deemed the risk too high to return to high school sports and activities. Certainly minimizing health risks to students, coaches, officials and others has to be the No. 1 consideration in conducting these activities and programs.
 ‚ÄúIn these situations, state associations are working with leaders on a safe return date, so very soon we believe high school sports and activities will be happening across all 50 states.‚Äù
 According to the CDPH, the first high school sports to begin are deemed low- contact outdoor sports and can be played in all tiers, if there is no regional stay-at-home order in effect. (Most of the state is in the purple tier, the most restrictive.) Those sports are cross country, golf, tennis, swimming and track.
 Swimming and track are spring sports in California, falling into Season 2 for this school year.
 Heinz said the state doesn‚Äôt want to play sports out of season.
 Sports that can be played in counties in the red tier ‚Äî the second most restrictive ‚Äî include baseball, field hockey, girls lacrosse and softball (all outdoor with moderate contact).
 Counties in the orange tier ‚Äî rural Sierra County is the only one right now ‚Äî can play outdoor high-contact sports, including football, boys lacrosse, soccer and water polo, and indoor low-contact sports like badminton, gymnastics and volleyball.
 Indoor high-contact sports such as basketball and wrestling are only permitted in counties that qualify for the yellow tier. There are no counties currently in that tier.
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wishing, hoping and praying for our season to start, but I‚Äôm not optimistic,‚Äù said Mike Haupt, basketball coach and assistant principal at St. Augustine High. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be a downer, but we‚Äôre getting different messages or no message.
 ‚ÄúI want to be optimistic. No one wants to say ‚ÄòCancel it.‚Äô‚Äù
 With so many sports not starting until February or March, Haupt is concerned about schools that have two-sport athletes. He‚Äôs concerned with facilities.
 And will there be enough officials ‚Äî referees and umpires ‚Äî for varsity, JV and freshman levels.
 Currently there is a proposal to allow practice or play on Sunday, normally a state-mandated off day.
 Arthur Gilbert, assignment secretary for the San Diego County Umpires Association, estimated 75-80 percent of officials are involved in more than one sport. So Sunday play would help get a full complement of officials to all games.
 Joe Terribilini, wrestling coach at Rancho Bernardo High, is holding out hope his sport will start in March as scheduled and not be shut down entirely.
 ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt realize wrestling is the most hygienic of all the sports,‚Äù Terribilini said. ‚ÄúAll our kids carry hand sanitizer in their bags. We wipe down everything ... hands, mats, chairs. You can‚Äôt compete if you have a fever.
 ‚ÄúAnd we could compete outdoors if necessary. It‚Äôs not uncommon to set up wrestling mats on a football field.
 ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd see the day where schools and businesses would close. But everything changes, so I hold out hope we‚Äôll be wrestling in March.‚Äù
 There has been talk of high school teams playing under an AAU umbrella outside of school jurisdiction.
 Football coaches are concerned with their season being pushed back to a March start with a finish in June. That would mean just weeks before summer 7-on-7 tournaments begin, putting athletes at risk.
 ‚ÄúWe have 23 seniors on our team and we want to play,‚Äù said La Jolla High receiver Diego Solis, who is headed to the Naval Academy next season. ‚ÄúWe hope to play. We want to play.
 ‚ÄúWe must take COVID seriously, and we do here ... mask, cleaning, distancing, supervision. Believe me, if we get too close at workouts the coaches are yelling.
 ‚ÄúBut we need to get it going as soon as it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù

Holden opted to recall Callum O‚ÄôDowda and Zak Vyner to his starting line-up with Adrian Mariappa and Tyreeq Bakinson dropped to the bench. With Famara Di√®dhiou suspended following his sending off on Tuesday, experienced attacking options were limited and Holden named attacking youngster Sam Pearson on the bench alongside four other players from the U23s ‚Äì Opi Edwards, Ryley Towler, Sam Bell and Zak Smith.
 I‚Äôm not making excuses, but that bench highlights just how thin our squad is right now and I for one won‚Äôt be judging Holden until he has some of the ten first teamers back available.
 But, even given the fact that we are so short in numbers and experience and this is such a tough league, you do still have to show the basic fundamentals. Not showing the effort, desire, running and being able to pass a ball ten yards is the least that as a fan we can expect and Holden has to get his formation and line-up better prepared to start games whatever the personnel.
 There really wasn‚Äôt much to write home about in the first half for City. The only real talking point was the penalty given away by Taylor Moore on 21 minutes. Scott Sinclair weaved across the box and fainted to shoot and Taylor challenged for the ball, slightly mistiming it and Sinclair made the most of the minimal touch. His theoretical dive was a joke and something that is all too familiar in the modern game by all teams and the ref gave the pen. Whether Taylor got something on the ball was not obvious to see and he did catch Sinclair and so as soft as it was, it was a penalty for me.
 Up stepped our nemesis Daniel Johnson to slot the ball past Dan Bentley. Johnson has one of those slow run-ups with his penalties, waiting for the keeper to move and I would have liked to have seen Bentley hold his nerve and stand his ground and force Johnson to make his own mind up. One nil down with just over 20 minutes gone and I‚Äôm ashamed to say it that with the performance I was watching, on the back of our recent form, I honestly felt that it was game over.

Around Russia, long-serving leaders have struggled to secure their rule. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko, a close Kremlin ally, is facing unprecedented and unrelenting popular protests against his efforts to remain in office. In Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, 80, has sought to retain a role as supreme leader after giving up the presidency to a trusted lieutenant last year.
 Putin unexpectedly highlighted his own age this week, saying he hadn‚Äôt taken the Russian-made vaccine he and his government have touted because it hasn‚Äôt been fully tested for people over 60. A number of other senior officials above that threshold have already been shown on national television getting it, however.
 Putin has shown signs of growing fatigue with his presidential duties after two decades at the helm, said Gleb Pavlovsky, a former Kremlin adviser.
 "Putin already several times thought about leaving office, though remaining a player in the game,‚Äù said Pavlovsky. "This thought has been in his head for some time and it doesn‚Äôt appear to be connected to any illness.‚Äù
 Even with protections written into law, true security for Putin will come only from putting loyalists into key positions who will ensure the unwritten rule against persecuting former leaders that‚Äôs held since the Soviet era persists.
 "The guarantee for him won‚Äôt be the law but the tradition and the absence of a counter-elite scenario,‚Äù says analyst Mikhail Vinogradov. "The elite in Russia understands that to throw the previous leader under the bus won‚Äôt benefit anyone.‚Äù

According to Nanasaki, while allowing female students to wear trousers is a relatively uncontroversial step, at least one school official has expressed a fear that "students who were born male but decide to wear skirts might become the targets of bullying."
 While insisting that such a choice should nevertheless be made available, Nanasaki said "understanding among adults is still very much lacking."
 A faculty member of a public high school in Kyushu where students are allowed to choose their uniforms also admitted that the policy could backfire if "the appeal is only made in consideration of sexual minorities."
 Unless the rationale is broadened, such students might hesitate to wear the uniforms they would feel most comfortable in for fear of standing out.
 "It's important that the students be able to choose freely no matter what the reason is, including for functionality," the faculty member said.
 Makoto Matsumoto, 17, a female second-year student at Shizuoka Prefectural Fujieda Nishi High School, ditched skirts for trousers, saying they were simply more comfortable and guard against the cold weather.
 "If I wear trousers, I don't have to worry about my legs freezing. I also don't have to be concerned about my skirt turning up when I pedal my bicycle. I won't be going back to skirts," Matsumoto said.
 Fujieda Nishi introduced trousers for girls in fiscal 2019 and began allowing three-quarter length pants for boys in the current fiscal year. "They're cool in the summer and easy to move around in," said Daiki Tsuneki, 16, a freshman at the school who has purchased the new trousers.
 Kyodo's surveys of the boards of education were conducted from October to November, with education officials able to verify a total of 639 schools in 19 prefectures that allowed a choice of student uniforms at high schools. The highest numbers were in Hokkaido, Tokyo, and Chiba with 97, 93 and 73 schools, respectively.
 In principle, only full-day schools were tabulated, but Hokkaido, Saitama and Tokyo prefectures included part-time schools. The tabulation period also varied depending on each board of education, and the number of high schools might have fluctuated since the survey was conducted.
 According to a survey by the Education Ministry, about 3,500 public high schools nationwide, including full-time and part-time prefectural and municipal schools, have introduced school uniform choices.
 The Kyoto Board of Education said most high schools in the prefecture allow girls to wear trousers, while the Wakayama Board of Education said "nearly half" of all its schools offer the same choice.
 In 2015, the Education Ministry issued a notice calling for consideration of sexual minority children, leading to an increase in the number of high schools offering options regarding school uniforms.
 According to Hiroko Onitsuka, a student guidance counselor at Fujieda Nishi, the school considered major overhauls to uniforms from 2018. Although women's trousers were immediately approved, there was pushback on men's three-quarter- length pants.
 Boys at the school had already fallen into the habit of rolling up their trouser cuffs to deal with the oppressive summer heat.
 A cooler uniform was proposed for "for today's global warming climate," but there was concern at the impression it might give.
 After getting a clothing manufacturer to produce prototypes and evaluating the uniforms for appearance and comfort, the school got some of the students on board. Because of the extra cost, so far only a handful of boys and girls have opted to buy the new uniforms, but the school hopes its liberal uniform policy will be one of the key attractions in the future.
 "To get students to wear the school uniforms faithfully, it is important that we give them a choice that matches what they desire as an individual," said Onitsuka.

 "It's like Xanax," she said, referring to the drug used to treat anxiety and depression.
 Shedding light on tragedies is also a way to challenge taboos and the political status quo, she added.
 A feminist and vocal LGBTQ activist, Shaden makes a mockery of machismo in a society that remains largely conservative.
 "Society has put up many barriers against women. We need to break them down," she said.
 "We talk about sex, not just to make people laugh, but also to say that women have a voice."
 For many performers, Shaden included, it is still too soon to joke about the Beirut blast. But everything else ‚Äî God, sex, religion ‚Äî is fair game.

Kyodo News surveys of education boards found that more than 600 prefecture-run schools in at least 19 of Japan's 47 prefectures have relaxed restrictions regarding uniform dress codes, such as permitting girls to wear trousers instead of skirts.
 Some schools in the 28 other prefectures have followed suit, although definitive data is not available from their education boards. Nevertheless, inquiries found that school uniform choices will be expanded nationwide to all prefectural high schools starting next spring.
 Clothes once viewed as "standard attire" on school campuses have caused mental anguish for students who identify as transgender, as well as in some cases for lesbian, gay and bisexual students.
 In August, a student at a high school in Tokyo's Edogawa Ward, who was born female but identifies as male, made a fervent pitch to Mayor Takeshi Saito to "stop the rise in kids hurt by school uniforms," demanding that all schools in the ward offer students a choice of uniforms unrelated to gender.
 "I used to have to stifle my emotions and thought of dying before reaching adulthood," said the student, who chose a high school that allows students to wear their own clothes after the bitter experience of being made to wear a skirt in junior high school.
 Saito has suggested he will consider removing gender rules for school uniforms.
 "By increasing the choices, it offers a lifeline for students who need it," said Ryosuke Nanasaki, 33, representative of the group LGBT Community Edogawa, and students who support the initiative in the ward.
 The most common step has been to allow trousers for female students, but schools are also dropping designations of uniforms as male or female and even allowing students born as male to wear skirts. Among high schools with no choices available as a general rule, some will address uniform concerns on a case-by-case basis if there are such requests.

The new murals, each about 7 meters in height and 5 meters in length, were painted on the exterior walls of a building that used to house a shop in front of JR Futaba Station. One depicts the boy as a 2-year-old toddler at the time of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster, while the other shows him as he is now.
 Futaba was designated a no-go zone due to high radiation levels following the disaster on March 11, 2011. Japan partially lifted its evacuation order in some parts of the northeastern town in March, but still nobody is able to live there.
 On Sunday, about 10 people, including former residents, visited the town to see the new additions to the art project.
 "I couldn't come to terms with the devastation of my hometown, but the murals gave me a chance to move forward," said Nozomi Kanda, currently a resident of Ichikawa, Chiba Prefecture, who visited Futaba for the first time since the disaster.
 The project was launched after a former resident, Jo Takasaki, came up with the idea of giving some life back to the town by decorating it with murals. He was inspired by a project in Amsterdam that transformed a former shipyard into a cultural hotspot through vibrant graffiti.
 A Tokyo firm, Over Alls Co., agreed to paint the murals for free after its graffiti artists were moved by the 39-year-old's proposal.
 In October, the company painted an eye-catching mural of a woman who owned a fast-food restaurant looking through the hole of a doughnut in front of the railway station.
 In the Fukushima disaster, three reactors at the plant, which straddles Futaba and the neighboring town of Okuma, suffered meltdowns and spewed radioactive material into the air, forcing the mass evacuation of residents.
 It is hoped residents will be able to return to live in the parts of the town where the evacuation order was lifted in spring 2022.
