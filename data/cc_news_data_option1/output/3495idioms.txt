The National Hurricane Center raised the chance of development for two tropical disturbances in the eastern Atlantic Ocean in its 2 p.m. advisory Wednesday.
 Their projected paths, while preliminary, have them moving west toward the United States and the Caribbean.
 Disturbance 1, which was midway between the Windward Islands and the coast of Africa on Wednesday, was given a 30 percent chance of formation over the next five days. Disturbance 2, directly off Africa’s coast, was given a 60 percent chance of formation in the same time frame.
 Disturbance 2 is developing near the Cabo Verde Islands. This area is known for being a nursery for tropical systems that eventually become hurricanes, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hurricane researcher Jason Dunion. The hurricane center said Wednesday that it expects Disturbance 2 to strengthen into a tropical depression over the weekend while slowly moving westward, strengthening along the way.
