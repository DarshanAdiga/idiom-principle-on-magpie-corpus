"Put your little foot, put your little foot, put your little foot right there." I've been thinking about dancing this week. Once I get a mental stew cooking for a writing topic, bits and pieces seem to jump out of everywhere and plop into the stew. Last night during one of my usual awakenings, Daddy and I were dancing in the kitchen, which seems to have been where we always danced. Daddy was a Navy cook on a minesweeper during World War II and never gave up his well-honed culinary skills; therefore, Mother, Daddy, Sister Patsy and I spent a lot time together in the kitchen, after moving from Mama's Place to our new house up the dirt road.
   
 I seem to remember that Mother and Daddy always danced in the kitchen. While the steak seared before requiring attention, they waltzed to a Glenn Miller 45 vinyl on our Zenith Radio Phonograph Combo that sat on a small table close to the stove. While Mother turned the steak, Daddy might ask Patsy to dance the Texas Two Step for Hank Williams Sr. to "find a brand new recipe" in "Hey Good Lookin'." Re-experiencing our kitchen dance hall, I most tenderly remember dancing with Daddy as he sang in his clear, mellow voice, "Put your little foot. Put your little foot. Put your little foot right there." I can recall that his efforts to teach me the footwork matching the lyrics often ended in anxious giggles. As Daddy sang, "Take a step to the right. Take a step to the left. Take a step to the rear, but forever stay near," I seemed to go left when he went right, but I did forever stay near.
   
 In the 1950s and early 1960s dancing was frowned up on in Scott County. During these years in my experience, not a single organized public dance took place. Waldron High School did not have proms; we had banquets. We students did not bother to question why we had no school dances because we knew that leaders went to churches that did not approve of dancing. Period. Although I knew not why, nice girls did not dance. I suppose this attitude necessitated my family's clandestine dances. As teens, Patsy and I bopped and twisted in our tiny den as Dick Clark's American Bandstand blared from our black and white console television.
   
 This dubious opinion of dancing was not limited to small-town Arkansas, as the illustrious story teller and humorist, Garrison Keillor, made clear in his version of "Put Your Little Foot." He sang, "[Name a denomination] like to dance, like to dance. They love choreography, but they do not dance, no they do not dance with a heathen like me." He continued, "[Name a different denomination] don't dance much, and they try not to touch, so they dance the beguine with their pastor in between." Garrison's delightful parody clarifies my own cognitive dissonance regarding dance. That is, I received conflicting early influence regarding dance -- enjoying dancing with family at home, while understanding from outside sources that it was wrong. Thus, I've never felt totally at ease with dancing. Perhaps that primal pull between experiencing the exhilaration of dancing and the old misguided opinions foisted upon me are responsible for dancing's sense of guilty pleasure.
   
 Regardless of these disquietudes, I will go as far as saying, "I am passionate about dance." After all, Ecclesiastes says there is a time to weep and a time to dance, and King David danced before the Lord with all his might when returning the ark to the tabernacle in Jerusalem. I still smile and tap my feet when Bobby and Sissy cut a rug on Lawrence Welk reruns, and when Mr. Welk dances with one of the pretty young girls, I can hear Daddy point out once again, "See how Lawrence lights up when he twirls a pretty girl?" Sitting in the Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville, I am mesmerized as the Broadway dancers kick and leap. I have been swept into the sky with Mary Poppins and Bert and identified with Maria's shyness during her first dance with Captain von Trapp in "The Sound of Music."
   
 Dancing takes me out of the ordinary and into infinite possibilities. A child dancing in costume can become a Mouse King, a sugar plum fairy or a snowflake. I really believe that four-year old ballerinas watching their teacher and methodically moving to her directions in robot fashion are the ladybugs their tutus suggest. I can dance with Richard Simmons to one of his "Sweatin' to the Oldies" videos, forget all about COVID-19, and return to the good ole' days of 1960. I like to dance with my six-year old granddaughters, Anya and Claire, marveling at their supple bodies, all the while declaring that I have never had a limber bone in my entire body. They don't seem to mind. In fact, during my recent visit Anya asked, "Nanna, will you dance with me for 10 minutes during my Zoom PE class?" Her contemporary moves took a completely different direction from Richard Simmons' oldies.
   
 I have thought a lot about dance this week. My conclusion is that for me, dancing represents holding on, getting back on the horse, putting one foot in front of the other, grinning and bearing it. I realize that as my family danced in the kitchen, we were stepping out of daily hardships and horrors of war into greener pastures of delightful pleasure. We danced our cares away, just as Daddy, Mother and countless other young people had done in United Service Organizations (USO) around the world during World War II. When I say, "Let the dance begin," I am telling myself to get up, get out there and do what needs to be done. I'm saying to get out of the mire and proceed with life, just like John Michael Montgomery sings in "Life's A Dance," "But I learned something from my blue eyed girl. Sink or swim you gotta give it a whirl." You know, Montgomery's description of life as a dance squares with my passion for dance. He sings, "Life's a dance you learn as you go. Sometimes you lead, sometimes you follow. Don't worry about what you don't know. Life's a dance you learn as you go."
   
 I recently returned home after visiting daughter Lee Anna in Chicagoland. In August, she told me about personalizing thermal mugs for her team of kindergarten teachers, promising to decorate one for me. When I arrived, she asked me to think of a short, catchy phrase for my mug. Wanting the exact kernel of truth that screamed my name, I opened my consciousness to possibilities. Right away I thought of dance. Knowing a short phrase was required to fit on the mug, I chose "Dance On."
   
 Mark Twain wrote "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn." He also wrote, "Dance like nobody's watching; love like you've never been hurt. Sing like nobody's listening; live like it's heaven on Earth."
   
 "Take a step to the right. Take a step to the left. Take a step to the rear, but forever stay near." Yes, Daddy, I know. Dance on.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice announced Friday that facial coverings will be required at all times in businesses and other indoor spaces starting at midnight. The Republican governor said businesses will need to post signs notifying entrants of the mask requirement under his executive order. “It's just silly to be in a public building with strangers walking around without a mask on,” Justice said at his coronavirus press conference. “Even if you have this macho belief or whatever it may be, it's silly.” Justice first issued an indoor mask order in July, but it did not require masks if social distancing was possible. The new mandate requires masks at all times except when eating or drinking. Justice also said Friday that public and private schools will need to refrain from in-person instruction from Thanksgiving through Dec. 3. All winter high school sports are postponed until Jan. 11, 2021, and band events are also curtailed, with spring festivals in public schools and concerts through the end of the year canceled. On Friday, the state reported 563 new confirmed coronavirus cases and a peak in hospitalizations at 339 patients with COVID-19. “This is not panic situation on the hospitals, but it is a warning opportunity” to take virus precautions more seriously, said Clay Marsh, a West Virginia University official leading the state’s coronavirus response. The state also reported 11 new deaths caused by COVID-19, bringing the death toll to at least 565. Justice urged businesses that encounter patrons not wearing a mask to call the police. He said his legal counsel has said law enforcement can charge individuals and businesses with obstruction of justice for disobeying the governor's executive order on facial coverings. Children...

 Thanksgiving is less than two weeks away, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is urging Americans to stay home and skip gathering with extended family and friends this year as coronavirus cases surge across the country. In fact, a Harris Poll of more than 2,000 people commissioned by Omaha Steaks found that more than half plan to celebrate Thanksgiving with five or less guests this year, which is down from 12 guests in a typical year. So, many people are now probably scrambling to put together a much smaller turkey dinner than they expected to make — and some serial holiday guests may be attempting to make the big meal themselves for the very first time.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — The Tennessee Titans handled the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak during the season in winning fashion.
 Now the Titans face another issue threatening their season: themselves.
 The team that won its first five games during a stretch when Tennessee had two games rescheduled by that COVID-19 outbreak has lost three of the last four. The Titans' 34-17 loss to Indianapolis on Thursday night cost them the top spot in the AFC South.
 Injuries and mistakes keep cropping up across the board.
 “No excuses,” Titans running back Derrick Henry said. “Just we have to be better as a team. We know that. We need to fix the mistakes.”
 The Titans (6-3) couldn't protect a 17-13 halftime lead. Coach Mike Vrabel says he doesn't think wholesale changes are the answer. He ticked off playing better, healing up and fixing mistakes as the keys Friday.
 The Titans get a rematch with the Colts on Nov. 29 in Indianapolis. The rest of the schedule provides no help, with five of their final seven games on the road.
 “No matter where we play we’re just going to have to play better," Vrabel said. "We're going to have to coach better and be ready to get going. We’re in this thing, but (we're) going to have to win games.”

Sin embargo, hay ocasiones en las que esto sobrepasa ciertos límites. Tal es el caso de este hombre que fue a un bosque en busca de setas y terminó encontrando una espada de 3 300 años de antigüedad que se ha vuelto viral en redes sociales. Una situación imaginable es la que vivió este hombre que no ocultó su asombro para hacer viral esta foto a través de redes sociales donde muestra el objeto que posee 3 300 años y pertenece a la Edad de Bronce.

Luego cavé un poco más para encontrar un hacha de bronce”, ha declarado a Radio Prague International.

In Cambridge, Massachusetts, he drove a Range Rover around campus, and according to a classmate, “He didn’t do it with a sense of humor. He did it, like, ‘I’m fucking rich.’” At 27, he became CEO of his family’s business while his father was in prison and was known for, among other things, buying an aging skyscraper on the eve of the financial crisis for a then record price of $1.8 billion—a deal that subsequently blew up in his face. In 2006, he purchased the _New York Observer_ for $10 million with what he said was his own money earned doing real estate deals during his time at Harvard, not mentioning that the backing for those investments reportedly came fromhis family. You may have also heard that he has zero government experience but got his current gig because his father-in-law is the president, which is also the only reason he was able to obtain his security clearance.

DETROIT (AP) — General Motors says it will recall nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars worldwide because the batteries have caught fire in five of them. The company says it doesn’t know yet what’s causing the fires, but engineers are working around the clock to figure it out. Two people have suffered smoke inhalation due to the blazes. Bolt Executive Chief Engineer Jesse Ortega says dealers will install software that limits charging to 90% of the battery’s capacity until a permanent fix is developed. The recall covers Bolts from the 2017 through 2019 model years, including nearly 51,000 in the U.S. It comes one month after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it is investigating Bolt fires.

The agency said in documents filed last month that the fires began under the rear seat while the cars were parked and unattended.Ortega says engineers have traced the fires to Bolts with battery cells made at an LG Chem factory in Ochang, South Korea, from May of 2016 to May of 2019. The fires have happened when the batteries were close to being fully charged, he said.“We have no confirmed incidents from vehicles with cells not produced at this factory or a lower state of charge,” Ortega said.Some 2019 Bolts and all 2020 and 2021 versions have cells made at an LG Chem plant in Holland, Michigan, and are not included in the recall, he said.GM hopes to find the cause and have a permanent repair as quickly as possible after the first of the year, Ortega said.

A nurse accused of the murders of eight babies in an alleged year-long killing spree at a hospital neonatal unit has appeared in the dock of a courtroom for the first time.
 Lucy Letby, 30, is alleged to have murdered five baby boys and three baby girls while working at the Countess of Chester Hospital.
 She is also accused of the attempted murder of five baby boys and five baby girls, all between June 2015 and June 1016.
 Letby appeared via videolink at Warrington Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.
 On Friday she appeared in the dock for the first time in person at Chester Crown Court.
 Letby, wearing grey jogging bottoms and a grey sweatshirt and carrying a bottle of water, spoke only to confirm her name and remained passive throughout the hearing, lasting around four hours and dealing with preliminary matters and a bail application.
 The defendant waved to her parents sitting in the public gallery as she came into and left court during brief adjournments.
 Her father mouthed “I love you” back to her.
 Judge Steven Everett, Honorary Recorder of Chester, imposed an order banning any information that could lead to the identification of witnesses and thereby prohibiting further publication of the names of the babies allegedly murdered by Letby.
 Ben Myers QC, representing Letby, made the application for bail, which was held in private and the press benches were cleared of the dozen or so reporters in court.
 An hour later press were allowed back into court to hear Judge Everett’s decision to refuse the bail application.
 Letby, of Arran Avenue, Hereford, was arrested in 2018 and 2019 as part of the police investigation into the Countess of Chester Hospital, which began in 2017.
 A further hearing is scheduled to be held at Liverpool Crown Court on Wednesday.

 WASHINGTON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Elon Musk´s SpaceX is poised to send a crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station on Saturday evening in NASA´s first operational mission using the Crew Dragon capsule.
 The Crew Dragon capsule, named "Resilience" by its crew, is due to launch atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 7:49 p.m. ET on Saturday (0049 GMT on Sunday) from NASA´s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida carrying three U.S. astronauts and one from Japan, Soichi Noguchi.
 The roughly eight-hour flight to the station will be SpaceX´s first operational mission, as opposed to a test, after NASA officials this week signed off on Crew Dragon´s design, ending a nearly 10-year development phase for SpaceX under the agency´s public-private crew program.
 "The history being made this time is we´re launching what we call an operational flight to the International Space Station," NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine said during a press conference at Kennedy Space Center.
 Musk, who usually attends high-profile SpaceX missions in person at Kennedy Space Center, said Thursday that he took four coronavirus tests on the same day, with two returning negative and two producing positive results.
 Bridenstine, asked on Friday if Musk will be in the launch control room for liftoff on Saturday, said agency policy requires employees to quarantine and self-isolate after testing positive for the disease, "so we anticipate that that will be taking place."
 Whether Musk came into contact with the astronauts was unclear, but unlikely since the crew has been in routine quarantine for weeks prior to their flight on Saturday.
 NASA contracted SpaceX and Boeing in 2014 to develop competing space capsules aimed at replacing its shuttle program that ended in 2011 and weaning off dependence on Russian rockets to send U.S. astronauts to space.
 SpaceX´s final test of its capsule came in August, after the company launched and returned the first astronauts from U.S. soil on a trip to the ISS in nearly a decade. Boeing´s first crewed test mission with its Starliner capsule is planned for late next year.

To add insult to injury, the SEC permitted Stumpf to settle its case without admitting or denying the commission’s findings. That makes a mockery of the assertion by the SEC’s enforcement director, Stephanie Avakian, that the settlement somehow demonstrates the SEC’s determination “to hold responsible ... senior executives who make false and misleading statements” in corporate disclosures.
 Instead, the settlement demonstrates that “too-big-to-fail banks don’t face meaningful enforcement, punishment, deterrence,” Hall says. “You’ve got to go after the senior executives — and here they go after the senior executive but in a way that sends the wrong message, which is that you’re going to get off virtually scot-free.”
 Why the SEC chose to finalize this settlement at this moment is a bit of a mystery. The wrongdoing at Wells Fargo, which was exposed in a series of articles in The Times in 2013, continued at least through 2015. Stumpf’s role was examined by regulators and congressional committees through 2016, when he was forced to resign.
 Monday’s settlement has the flavor of a hasty wrap-up. Corporate accountability expert Nell Minow asked on Twitter whether it’s a “last-minute settlement before the new Biden sheriffs come to town.”

El Paso Gridley High School is in the second week of a two-week stint in remote learning after the students in quarantine passed 20%.
 “We had a couple positive cases which led to some students being quarantined. We also had several students quarantine from contact outside of school in different settings,” said Superintendent Brian Kurz. “We felt like, as a precautionary measure, it made sense to go remote with the high school for two weeks.”
 Kurz said the quarantines, which follow close contact with positive cases, have been the most challenging issue, not the number of positive cases in the schools.
 Since the beginning of the school year, some of the district’s elementary school classrooms and entire grade levels at El Paso Gridley Junior High have done two-week periods of remote learning.
 “We’re just working through those situations … and so far after their two-week stints, they’ve been able to come back to in person and we’ve hit the ground running,” Kurz said.
 Going remote at 20% in quarantine is “not a hard fast rule,” but the administration takes into consideration staffing, student schedules and the potential impact on student learning, Kurz said.
 Like many districts in the area, El Paso Gridley has had difficulty finding substitutes for not just classroom teachers, but also custodians and bus drivers.
 “Right now we have administrators that are going in as second-shift custodians and some of them are driving buses and doing what we need to to keep school going,” Kurz said.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — One of the first cruise ships to ply through Caribbean waters since the pandemic began ended its trip early after at least five passengers tested positive for COVID-19, officials said Thursday.
 The SeaDream I is carrying 66 crew and more than 50 passengers, with the majority of passengers hailing from the U.S. according to Sue Bryant, who is aboard the ship and is a cruise editor for The Times and The Sunday Times in Britain.
 She told The Associated Press that one passenger became sick on Wednesday and forced the ship to turn back to Barbados, where it had departed from on Saturday. However, the ship had yet to dock in Barbados as local authorities tested those on board. The captain announced that at least five passengers have tested positive, Bryant said.
 The incident marked the first time SeaDream had resumed its West Indies voyages since the pandemic, with the ship originally scheduled to return to Barbados on Saturday, according to an online itinerary. The ship had made several stops in St. Vincent and the Grenadines before turning back.
 The Norway-based SeaDream Yacht Club, the ship’s parent company, wouldn’t say how many passengers tested positive in the initial round of testing.
 Bryant said passengers were required to have a negative PCR test to enter Barbados and underwent another test on the dock administered by the ship’s doctor.
 “We all felt very safe,” she said, adding that the ship had been implementing strict hygiene protocols. “Yet somehow, COVID appears to have got on board.”
 SeaDream said the ship’s medical staff has tested all crew members and that all tested negative. The company also said it is currently re-testing all guests, noting they're all under quarantine along with non-essential crew members.
 “We are working closely with local health and government authorities to resolve this situation in the best possible way,” SeaDream said. "Our main priority is the health and safety of our crew, guests, and the communities we visit.”
 Government officials in Barbados did not return messages for comment.
 Waters around the Caribbean have been largely bereft of cruise ships this year, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suspending cruise ship operations at U.S. ports in mid-March. The no-sail order expired on Oct. 31.
 Last week, the Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 95% of global ocean-growing cruise capacity, said its members were voluntarily suspending cruise operations in the U.S. through Dec. 31.
 SeaDream was among the first cruise lines to resume service in Europe. In August, the company reported that an asymptomatic passenger had tested positive for the coronavirus after disembarking from SeaDream I in Denmark. All other passengers and crew tested negative, the company said.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX chief Elon Musk may have to steer clear of NASA’s Kennedy Space Center after getting mixed COVID-19 test results on the eve of his company’s second crew launch. Musk took to Twitter on Friday to say he tested positive for coronavirus, then negative twice, then positive again. He said he wasn’t feeling too well the past few days — sniffles, cough, low fever — but currently had no symptoms. “So ‘Elon Musk Tests Negative for Covid’ is an equally correct title,” he tweeted. Musk said his first tests were rapid tests, and he was awaiting the results of lab tests. The 15-minute rapid tests are less sensitive than the lab tests, which taken longer to process. At a news conference, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said he expects SpaceX “to do any contact tracing that is appropriate.” He stressed it is NASA policy that anyone testing positive for COVID-19 must immediately quarantine and remain isolated. Neither NASA nor SpaceX representatives would say where Musk was Friday. His company is based in Southern California, where he makes his home. He was inside Kennedy's Launch Control last May for SpaceX’s first astronaut flight last May. Four astronauts — three Americans and one Japanese — are scheduled to rocket to the International Space Station on Saturday night. “NASA and SpaceX are going to work through it together and come to the right conclusion,” Bridenstine told reporters. “Our astronauts have been in quarantine for weeks and they should not have had contact with anybody (outside their tested inner circle). They should be in good shape.” Bridenstine said it was too early to know if any changes will be necessary in the final stages of the countdown. One of the test pilots on SpaceX's first...

L’Union européenne a décidé de partir en croisade contre l’immigration clandestine. Elle a, à cet effet, financé un programme de rapatriement des sans-papiers ivoiriens et Sénégalais et burkinabé, basé sur l’identification biométrique, afin d’organiser leur retour vers leurs pays d’origine et ce, dès leur arrivée en Europe.
   
 En effet, confrontée à des vagues d’arrivées quasi quotidiennes de migrants qui débarquent par centaines sur les côtes européennes, l’Union européenne a décidé de prendre le taureau par les cornes. Selon le site Bloomberg consulté par Seneweb, l’UE va désormais faire recours à l’identification biométrique des migrants présents dans l’espace Schengen en vue de les expulser vers leurs pays de départ.
   
 En Côte d’ivoire, ce système permet d’une part de faciliter l’identification des personnes de nationalité ivoirienne afin de faciliter leur retour, renseigne un rapport de l’Ong Privacy international, une Ong qui milite pour la défense des droits de l’homme en particulier contre la violation de la vie privée commis par les gouvernements et autres organisations.
   
 Pour y arriver, l’Union européenne a mis des moyens conséquents : elle a affecté un financement de 60 millions d’euros (39 milliards de FCFA) à l’organisme en charge du projet “EU Trust Fund for Africa”. 30 millions d’euros sont destinés au Sénégal et 28 millions d’euros à la Côte d’ivoire, détaille le site Courrier du Soir, qui parle de vol de données privées.
   
 Mais Privacy international tire déjà la sonnette d’alarme. Elle y voit une violation des données personnelles (nom, prénoms, date de naissance, numéro de passeport, empreintes digitales, reconnaissance faciale) des migrants, qu'ils soient réguliers ou non. Or, cette collecte de données personnelles peut être utilisée à d’autres fins, redoute l’organisation non gouvernementale basée en Grande Bretagne selon laquelle ces données peuvent tomber dans les mains d’Interpol.
   
 Il faut rappeler que dans le cadre de leur coopération, l’UE et le Sénégal ont mis en place le projet Civipol financé en 2016 à hauteur de 10 millions d’euros par l’Union européenne. Il s’agit d’une assistance technique qui a, entre autres objectifs, de mieux outiller les services de sécurité intérieure du Sénégal (police, gendarmerie, douanes, etc.) pour le contrôle et la surveillance des frontières, y compris dans la lutte contre la migration irrégulière.

DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is recalling nearly 69,000 Chevrolet Bolt electric cars worldwide because the batteries have caught fire in five of them.
 The company says it doesn't know yet what's causing the fires, but engineers are working around the clock to figure it out. Two people have suffered smoke inhalation due to the blazes.
 Bolt Executive Chief Engineer Jesse Ortega says dealers will install software that limits charging to 90% of the battery's capacity until a permanent fix is developed.
 The recall covers Bolts from the 2017 through 2019 model years, including nearly 51,000 in the U.S.
 It comes one month after the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it was investigating. The agency said in documents filed last month that the fires began under the rear seat while the cars were parked and unattended.
 Ortega says engineers have traced the fires to Bolts with battery cells made at an LG Chem factory in Ochang, South Korea, from May of 2016 to May of 2019. The fires have happened when the batteries were close to being fully charged, he said.
