Vaporization is a strategy for avoiding aggravating respiratory poisons in weed smoke - by warming cannabis to a temperature at which psychoactive ingredients dissipate without burning and making any harm. Various research affirms that vaporizers can be proficiently provided with cannabinoids - while simultaneously wiping out or radically decreasing different poisons from the smoke. Like tobacco, weed smoke contains poisons that are known to be unsafe for the human respiratory system.

Some have questioned where Haslem belongs in Heat history. He holds the franchise record for rebounds, is a three-time NBA champion and will have his jersey retired when his career ends. Combine that with his stature in the community and it's debatable if Ha has earned a spot on the Heat's Mount Rushmore alongside Pat Riley, Dwyane Wade and LeBron James. He is longer tenured with the Heat than Shaquille O'Neal and played all 17 seasons in Miami unlike Alonzo Mourning.

RABAT — Pottery, basketwork and wrought-iron furniture pile up in the deserted stalls of the Oulja arts and crafts complex in Sale near the Moroccan capital Rabat.
 Artisans have been starved of income for almost three months because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 “Coronavirus is the knockout punch: Without help, without support, our profession will disappear,” said Youssef Rghalmi, a 49-year-old potter.
 In the family workshop, where skills have been handed down from generation to generation, the clay has dried up, the oven is turned off and the nine employees no longer turn up for work.
 The last order, for a customer from France who called off her visit because of border closures, is gathering dust in a corner.
 “We were already struggling to survive because lifestyles have changed,” said Mohamed Touel, a master carver of “gebs” decorative plaster.
 “Traditional trades are being lost because young people don’t want to take over.”
 The enterprising 62-year-old had added a small restaurant to his shop but it closed because of lockdown measures imposed since mid-March.
 Foreign tourists have vanished, the lockdown has paralysed economic life and local customers “have other priorities”, Ahmed Driouch said in his store cluttered with copper lamps, ceramics, daggers, jewelry, inlaid chests and carpets.
 Business has been “200 per cent affected by the virus”, he said, grimly forecasting it would take “at least two or three years” to return to normal
 Upstairs, employees dusted some 10,000 carpets in stock, one by one.
 “We must clean everything even if, for now, nobody’s coming,” one of them said ruefully, vacuum cleaner in hand.
 Minister of Tourism and Handicrafts Nadia Fettah has proposed ideas such as exhibition spaces in supermarkets to revive a sector that provides employment to two million people.
 That includes about 230,000 traditional artisans.
 The crafts industry represents around 7 per cent of GDP, with an export turnover last year of nearly 1 billion dirhams ($100 million).
 Despite their role in the economy, artisans work without social security cover and with a limited distribution network, much of it through word of mouth, like elsewhere in North Africa.


 ‘Don’t know Internet’


 The 30 women who weave rugs for a small cooperative called “Creative Woman” in Sale have all lost their meagre incomes.
 Weavers work eight hours a day for barely $100 a month “when the carpets are sold” and they “have nothing left because there has not been a single sale in three months”, explained Rachida Nabati.
 The energetic woman in her 40s, who has been a weaver since the age of seven, has been forced to borrow from friends to supplement her modest earnings from a vegetable garden next to her shack.
 In the cooperative, some have been bailed out by a state coronavirus emergency fund, while many others “can no longer pay their rent”.
 “We have to sell on the Internet but we don’t know how to do that,” said the mother who taught herself to read and write.
 “A digital platform was launched for artisans a few years ago, but it doesn’t work,” master plasterer Mohamed Touel said.
 In Tunisia, the National Office of Handicrafts has been working on an electronic platform for sales in Europe and has organised small exhibitions in hotels.
 It also encourages artisans to launch Facebook pages or electronic sites.
 But Sabiha, a potter in the Tunisian rural town of Sejnan whose works are on UNESCO’s list of “intangible cultural heritage”, said she cannot “even afford to recharge” her mobile phone.

Upfronts 2009: Complete Coverage   Fox Broadcasting said August 5 that it has wrapped its upfront negotiations.   CBS, The CW and NBC are expected to follow suit soon and call a close to the most protracted upfront in recent memory. ABC is still negotiating with advertisers.   In a statement released on Wednesday evening, after Fox-parent News Corp. wound up its fiscal 2009 earnings call with analysts, Fox sales president Jon Nesvig said, "As the upfront selling season winds down, Fox Broadcasting has   achieved its primetime goal." The network did not specify what the goal was and did not shed any light on its CPM pricing or the amount of inventory it sold.   However, in line with other broadcast networks, Fox is selling less airtime and gambling that a more robust economy brings with it higher scatter pricing.   "With a broader economic recovery seeming to take hold, we are very confident that our marketplace is positioned positively for next year."   Other executives in the market said Fox agreed to roll back pricing in the low mid-single digits.   Wachovia media analyst John Janedis estimates that broadcast networks are holding an additional 10% of inventory for scatter.   Total upfront dollars are expected to drop between 10% and 15%.

Hyundai recruited the help of a stunt team to show off its new autonomous Genesis saloon that appears to drive safer than most behind the wheel.
 If they gave out awards for best way to advertise a car, then Hyundai would likely be taking first place.
 To promote the driver assist technologies on the new 2015 Hyundai Genesis, the car maker recruited a stunt team to push its tech to the test.
 Six stuntmen got their own Genesis and lined up in a convoy at the Hyundai test track in the Mojave Desert.
 Each daredevil was ordered to engage adaptive cruise, lane hold and automatic emergency braking before setting off around the track.
 Once in motion, five of the stunt drivers climbed out on to the roof and jumped on to a truck leaving the autonomous vehicles following the lead car with the driver still in.
 Driver Joe Hooker then blindfolds himself as the truck then moves in front of the progressing convey and brakes hard – at which point the autonomous vehicles also come to an impressive halt.
 The video shows how far autonomous cars have come with a potential future for them on the roads.
 Smart cruise control is being tested by other car makers at the moment including Ford and Volvo.

The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) adopted a wait-and-watch approach for resumption of cricket activity as the number of positive cases of Covid-19 is still on the rise.
 Cricket in Mumbai has come to a grinding halt since the second week of March due to outbreak of pandemic. Mumbai is one of the worst-affected cities as the number of positive cases breached past the 50,000 mark on Monday.
 The MCA Apex Council met on Monday at the MCA Lounge to discuss several issues. A few members joined through video conference. An Apex Council member told _PTI_ that they will strictly follow the guidelines of the state government with regard to resumption of cricket activity and will wait and watch on how things unfold.
 "So in this period, where there is no activity, we will carry out renovation work of the stadium," the member said.
   
   
 Presently, the Maharashtra government has allowed only individual actives like walking, jogging and cycling in Mumbai outside containment zones in their Mission Begin Again, but haven't said anything on resumption of group activities. This means the players will have to wait longer to hit the ground running.
 The MCA decided to defer the decision on forming the ad-hoc Cricket Improvement Committee, which usually comprises three members, it was reliably learnt. It is also understood that the Committee did not fix the date of the Annual General Meeting. The MCA office, which is closed since March, will remain so until further notice.

 What's more, the 5.7-in Galaxy Note 3 has an incredible 3,200mAh battery, shaming Apple's purportedly meagre batteries.
 Apple devices are often derided for their poor battery lives, as seen in the recent Samsung ad that dubbed iPhone users as 'wall-huggers.'
 Unfortunately, a bigger battery does not necessarily mean a big increase in battery life - the iPhone 6 variants both have increased screen sizes, and more powerful processors, meaning the devices will be hungrier than ever before.

HTC appears to be jumping on the Android Wear bandwagon as a concept render of its 'One Wear' smartwatch surfaces online.
 HTC is entering the world of wearables with its so-called 'One Wear' smartwatch, which has showed its face in a leaked concept render.
 Powered by Android Wear, pictures of the rumoured device surfaced online courtesy of tech tipster @evleaks who claims that the "Hardware is 100% faithful reproduction.”
 The smartwatch appears to retain many of the metallic features of the successful HTC One M8 that was released earlier this year.
 It has a metal strap and square front, rather than the rounded face that was rumoured like the one on the Moto 360.
 Sources claim that concept render is based on a model already in the works at HTC.
 The pictures show a split-screen user interface with three panes showing the date and time, weather, traffic and a Hangouts notification - all run on a HTC sense-themed version of Google's Android Wear OS.
 So far that's about it, with no word yet on what features it will boast or when it's set to arrive.

Britain's Prince Andrew on Monday hit back at claims he had failed to cooperate with US authorities investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
 US lawyers have claimed that Queen Elizabeth II's second son refused to help in the case, which centres around lurid sex trafficking claims against the multi-millionaire financier.
 The 60-year-old senior royal publicly defended his friendship with Epstein in a BBC television interview last year, prompting outrage from his victims, and leading him to quit frontline royal duties.
 But Andrew's lawyers, Blackfords, said in a statement that claims he had stonewalled investigators were untrue, and accused the US Department of Justice (DoJ) of chasing headlines.
 "The Duke of York has on at least three occasions this year offered his assistance as a witness to the DoJ," the statement said.
 "Unfortunately, the DoJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the Duke has offered zero co- operation.
 "In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered."
 Andrew, a former Royal Navy helicopter pilot who as a younger man had a reputation as a playboy prince, is accused of having sexual relations with one woman when she was 17 -- an allegation he has vehemently denied.
 The woman, Virginia Giuffre, alleges she was trafficked under-age to have sex with friends of Epstein, who was 66 when he killed himself in a New York jail in August last year.
 The hedge fund manager, who befriended countless celebrities over the years, including US President Donald Trump, was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
 \- 'Disappointing' -
 Andrew's lawyers said they had upheld their commitment to confidentiality but said they were forced to go public "in view of misleading media briefings" from the United States.
 US investigators had been looking into Epstein's affairs for more than 16 years but only requested the prince's help on January 2 this year, they said.
 "Importantly, the DoJ advised us that the Duke is not and has never been a 'target' of their criminal investigations into Epstein and that they sought his confidential, voluntary cooperation.
 "In the course of these discussions, we asked the DoJ to confirm that our co- operation and any interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with the ordinary rules that apply to voluntary co-operation with the DoJ," the statement said.
 "We were given an unequivocal assurance that our discussions and the interview process would remain confidential."
 The lawyers pointed to two claims from New York attorney Geoffrey Berman on January 27 and March 9 that the duke was refusing to cooperate, leading to "misleading" media reports.
 "These statements were inaccurate, and they should not have been made," Andrew's lawyers added, accusing the DoJ of treating their client "by a lower standard" than anyone else.
 The Sun newspaper on Monday reported that the DoJ had submitted a mutual legal assistance request to Britain's interior ministry to force the prince to give a statement.
 His lawyers said that would be "disappointing" given his willingness to do provide a written statement voluntarily.

World champions South Africa may change the dates of a three-Test series against the British and Irish Lions next year, national body chief executive Jurie Roux said Monday.
 The eagerly awaited visit is scheduled for July and August 2021 and the Tests in Soweto, Cape Town and Johannesburg clash with the rearranged Tokyo Olympics.
 But a possible new, post-coronavirus pandemic global rugby calendar could see the tour dates change rather than the Games in Japan.
 Roux said "a move to host the tour later in 2021 was being considered to dovetail with all other Test scheduling conversations taking place.
 "It would be a disappointment if the Lions series had to be played behind closed doors," he added, referring to the current crowd-less sport situation to combat the COVID-19 disease.
 There has been speculation about northern and southern hemisphere rugby date changes, including staging the Six Nations and Rugby Championship in March and April.
 And instead of July and November Tests, an October-November window has been mooted with northern teams travelling first, then hosting internationals.
 Roux hinted that rugby could resume not later than August in South Africa, where the virus death toll edged close to 1,000 Monday with a five-tier national lockdown at level three.
 SA Rugby is hoping to get the green light from the sports ministry in mid-June to permit a resumption of training.
 \- Last rugby match -
 The last rugby match in the republic was on March 14 when the Sharks defeated the Stormers in Super Rugby.
 Roux hoped two Tests against Scotland and one with Georgia, originally scheduled for next month, might be played during October.
 There was also talk of Australia hosting this year a Rugby Championship including South Africa, New Zealand and Argentina, and trimmed from the usual two rounds to one.
 Roux said a November tour by the Springboks, consisting of Tests in Italy, Ireland, France and Wales, was still on the cards.
 He was non-committal on repeated reports that the four South African franchises in Super Rugby may abandon the southern hemisphere competition and switch to an enlarged European PRO-18.
 One recent report said the Bulls, Lions, Sharks and Stormers would join in 2021 or 2023 a competition already including two South African sides, the Cheetahs and Kings.
 "Speculation that more South African sides might join the PRO-14 was understandable in the circumstances, but it was too early to reach any conclusions," the chief executive stressed.
 Roux also said the Sunwolves were dumped from Super Rugby, starting next season, because the Japanese national rugby body "refused to underwrite the team like every other union".
 The South African also dismissed reports that he was joining World Rugby as chief executive, saying he was committed to delivering a "successful British and Irish Lions tour".
