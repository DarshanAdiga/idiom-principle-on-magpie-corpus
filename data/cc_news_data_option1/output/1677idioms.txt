Struggling to make ends meet amid the lockdown, lakhs of migrant workers have demanded permission to go back to their hometowns. On Wednesday too, hundreds of migrant workers employed at a construction site on the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad campus attacked officials of the construction companies, demanding wages and permission to go home amid the nationwide lockdown.
 On Tuesday, workers in Gujarat’s Surat city vandalised the office of a construction site after the contractors allegedly brought in more labourers from other parts of the state to speed up the work. Earlier this month, thousands of migrant workers had gathered in Mumbai’s Bandra suburb to protest, demanding transportation arrangements to go back to their hometowns.
 Last week, the Uttar Pradesh government brought back over 12,000 labourers who were stranded in Haryana amid the lockdown. The state government also sent 250 buses to Rajasthan’s Kota city to bring back stranded students. Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Assam have also said that they will bring students back from the coaching centre hub.
 On March 24, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that India was going into lockdown for three weeks in an attempt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
 The initial result was chaos and a huge migrant exodus. On the last day of the first phase of the lockdown, Modi announced that the lockdown was going to be extended till May 3.

This type of opportunity is one Bankes has always wanted.      Since her husband is able to be with the kids right now, she figured "why not now."      She is very excited for an opportunity to be among healthcare workers from all parts of the country in a time when they are being relied on, and appreciated more than ever.      "A lot of times, nurses say its a thankless job. We don't really get the thanks that we sometimes wish we had gotten," Bankes said.      "We don't expect a thanks but it's nice especially in cases where these types of patients are recovering, it's nice to see them at their worst and then see them being discharged and they're walking out and they're so happy that they're feeling so much better."      At the end of the day, Bankes will be happy to return home to her family, bringing back knowledge to help the fight against COVID-19 in the stateline.
