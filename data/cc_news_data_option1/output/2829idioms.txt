Hopes of a late British invasion come August 1 are not high. That is the date when the government is poised to green light flights from Britain by moving it from category C into category B, allowing visitors but only if they have a negative coronavirus test 72 hours before arrival. Big UK tour operators announced this week, however, that they would not bring travellers to Cyprus unless the UK was moved into category A, those countries which need no tests.

Snails — escargots, if you like to eat them in French restaurants. For you and me, love is complicated enough, but snails take it to another level. You see, each snail may be a boy snail or a girl snail (straightforward enough) or - get this — a boy snail and a girl snail at the same time. (I won’t go in with that other combination of now a boy snail, now a girl snail, which apparently some can also do!) So he’s a she and she’s a he and what the heck happens when they set eyes on one another — or actually sniff each other out? Naturally, they draw closer, very slowly, just checking each other out, making sure the other is indeed the snail of their dreams — and of the same species. If so, they’ll slowly manoeuvre around one another doing what would be the equivalent of a snail waltz, touching feelers and kissing. Actually, like slow-motion Sumo wrestlers, they’re jousting for the best position.

The chemicals that cover the harpoon enter each partner’s bloodstream, encouraging the fertilisation of the lady’s eggs while at the same time discouraging any further mating with another Lothario. His lady partner, however, has the opposite in mind — she wouldn’t mind going around with as many slime-ball rakes as she can — so that her babies may have multiple fathers, and thus, a better chance to survive. So her internal plumbing is designed to digest more than 99 per cent of her beau’s sperms, before they make their way to a pouch where they can be stored for use later on. So a battle of the sexes is very much on the cards! It’s said that the gentleman with the stronger, longer, faster harpoon has a better chance at becoming a father than one whose harpoon does not quite have the same firepower. The lady, in the meantime, tries to make sure that fertilisation is minimised, so she can carry on with other guys and improve her chances of giving birth to the Rambo-equivalent of snails. She may try to develop a thicker skin so as to shield her from the dart, but this seems to be a long shot considering how soft and spongy her body is.

A 23-year-old firebrand, Lewis toned down his intended remarks at the insistence of others, dropping a reference to a “scorched earth” march through the South and scaling back criticisms of President John Kennedy. It was a potent speech nonetheless, in which he vowed: “By the forces of our demands, our determination and our numbers, we shall splinter the segregated South into a thousand pieces and put them together in an image of God and democracy.”

There was a long pool behind her, and she had one hand resting on the back of a white outdoor lounge chair. It was part of a trio, and all of the chairs had throw pillows with black-and-white herringbone patterns propped against their back cushions.
