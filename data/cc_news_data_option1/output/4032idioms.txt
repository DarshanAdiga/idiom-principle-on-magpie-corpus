“You can't really say this came out of nowhere because we've seen the (COVID-19) cases spike,” Cunningham said. “But I call these (COVID rule) announcements ‘gov-bombs.’ Because nobody knows they’re coming. When I get a note, an email, from the governor's office and it says ‘Update,’ I say: ‘Oh, God, here's another gov-bomb,” Cunningham said.
 Cunningham doesn’t think Evers or the state’s Department of Health Services has consulted chambers of commerce prior to issuing new public health orders, and he said the state hasn’t forewarned or explained the orders in advance.
 “We had 36 hours to figure this out. They're not talking to anybody. They're doing this in a vacuum. And then business owners are forced to interpret these orders. And most of the time, the orders are very vaguely worded. I mean, people are sitting there trying to figure out, ‘Am I exempt from this or not?’” Cunningham said.
 Cunningham pointed out that wedding and other private event venues seem to be exempt from the latest order. Cunningham finds that curious given that Evers has expressed concern about large, private events having potential to spread the virus.
 Short of the state’s main business lobby having a seat at the table, Cunningham thinks state and local business groups and the public at least deserve advanced notice along with clearer explanation of new public health rules.
 The latest mandate has brought nearly the same volume of phone calls to Cunnningham’s office as he saw in March and April, when Evers’ safer-at-home mandate shuttered many “non-essential” businesses temporarily.
 Cunningham believes the state will eventually provide clarity, but that likely won’t come before the rule has already gone into effect.
 He expects there to be confusion from business operators that will soon face decisions on crowd control. The stakes for making the wrong decisions on crowds could cost businesses a $500 civil fine, according to the order.
 “Nobody wants to be that bad actor, the person who made assumptions, was wrong, and then gets in trouble. I know of nobody who wants that,” Cunningham said.
 Maggie Darr, a city spokeswoman, said the Janesville Police Department will respond to complaints over crowd sizes, but she said the department’s first priority has been and will continue to be helping to “educate” businesses on state COVID-19 policy.
 Darr said the city considers the Rock County District Attorney’s Office the criminal justice agency with ultimate authority to decide and approve citations for complaints against businesses.
 White, the Friendly Tap bartender who said she wears masks in every business she goes into, believes that most businesses won’t fight or flout the crowd size order, even if they don’t like it.
 “People have got to cooperate. At the same time, I mean, people have got to work. I’ve got a child and bills. I have to work. I don’t want to see any businesses fail because of this.” White said. “But what other choice is there except to cooperate?”

BOONVILLE, Ind. (WFIE) - As 30 new cases of coronavirus were reported in Warrick County on Wednesday, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to keep those at the county health department busy.Warrick County Health Department Administrator Aaron Franz believes some residents are not staying quarantined when they should be.“I think that when someone is supposed to be in quarantine, they need to be in quarantine - whether that’s as a contact or as a positive," Franz said. “I know some of the positives are asymptomatic and I think that may be part of the problem, maybe they just may not know. But the ones that do know, I think if they follow the protocol, I think we’d be in a lot better shape."One person taking COVID-19 protocol seriously is Boonville Mayor Charlie Wyatt. After testing positive for COVID-19, he has remained in quarantine for the last three weeks.“We do a lot of watching TV and a lot of hand holding. Fortunately, I’ve got a lot of good friends that have picked things up - they’ve dropped things off for us," Mayor Wyatt said.Wyatt says he’s barely shown any symptoms of COVID-19 despite testing positive, but with Warrick County having a seven-day positivity rate of 7.05% and 261 cases per 100,000 residents, he’s not taking any chances of spreading it.“You know, anybody that’s had this or is going through it - my heart goes out to them," Mayor Wyatt said. “My prayers go out to them."As we now enter the cold and flu season, Franz hopes for the best.“The flu season last year was terrible, and hopefully it won’t follow suit this year with everything else we have going on," Franz said. “But if it does - it’s going to be hard for us to monitor that."Copyright 2020 WFIE.

When Madison Metropolitan School District voters fill out their ballots for the Nov. 3 election, they’ll be greeted by two questions for the district’s latest referendum.
 Those two questions and how electors vote on them will play a large role in the future of the school district’s ability to spend money on capital projects to renovate aging schools and build a new one. They would also allow the district to exceed the spending limits for the operating budget to support the projects.
 Combined, the capital projects referendum, at $317 million, and operating budget referendum, at $33 million, make up one of the largest school referendums in state history.
 The capital referendum, which is the longer and more descriptive question on the ballot, is for a variety of projects that would renovate the four aging neighborhood high schools and build a new elementary school in the Rimrock Road neighborhood just north of the City of Fitchburg’s border on the eastern side. It would also allow the district to remodel the Hoyt School building, located a few blocks south of University Avenue near West High, to relocate Capital High.

 Coastal Carolina had its game with Louisiana moved up a week to this upcoming Saturday to adjust for other games in the Sun Belt Conference being impacted by the coronavirus, but the Chanticleers won't be able to play in Lafayette this weekend.
 Hurricane Delta is expected to make landfall along the Gulf Coast and possibly go through Lafayette on Friday, and it has caused the game to be rescheduled to next Wednesday. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. (Eastern) and the game will be broadcast on ESPN.
 The storm made landfall near Cancun on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico early Wednesday morning and is expected to pack hurricane-force winds and a large storm surge when it makes landfall in Louisiana.
 The area is already beleaguered after being hit hard by Category 4 Hurricane Laura in late August.
 If Cajun Field and its facilities are too damaged or unsafe, the teams have agreed to potentially move the game to Brooks Stadium in Conway. That will be determined by Sunday.

Music fans who know Bryan Porter Hinkley from his previous bands might be surprised by the sound of his brand new solo debut EP, "We Live Through It."
 That's because Hinkley, who now lives in Milton, is probably best known to local rock fans as part of Tree, the hardcore punk quartet that released half- a-dozen sizzling albums between 1993 and 2001. Later, Hinkley and his brother (and Tree drummer) Bill Hinkley formed Never Got Caught, which shifted their sound a bit into hard rock, and has put out four solid albums. In between all that, Hinkley did a stint in '99 playing guitar with Boston punk-rock legends Gang Green, and spent five years on the road as a tour guitarist with Maryland hard-rockers Clutch.
 So, will it turn heads to learn that Hinkley's solo effort, while maintaining that punky intensity and insouciant attitude, works in a folk-pop mode? The new EP, produced by Paul Gaster of the hard rock group Clutch, was recorded, written, and produced during the pandemic. Lyrically, Hinkley's songs suggest taking a new look at life in these days, seeking a sharper focus on what really matters.

 "I think that's partially it," Hinkley agreed when we offered that interpretation. "That was definitely on my mind when the pandemic forced the world into kind of a pause. It brought on some forced introspection. But the overarching thought I was having was about time and change, and how it relates to people. We were all in a stand-aside mode. Lyrically I like to keep an abstract direction, rather than being super specific. That way, people can interpret as they want. I try to keep it loose, so more people can take it and relate it to their own experience."
 On the new EP, due out on October 16, the tune "Red Bull and Gasoline (Living for a Change)" is a surging folk-rocker, with words about finding a new way to look at life in America. The frenetic pace and swirling guitars of "Hand In the Fire," delivers a message about habits and patterns of behavior shaping us. "No Time" is probably the most punk-influenced number, what might accurately be called folk-punk, a rhythmic charge that deals with self-doubt and reassessing things.
 Hinkley will be performing the new music on The Town and The City Festival on October 23-24 on the Once Somerville virtual venue, and then has a virtual concert celebrating the new record on November 13, also on the Once Somerville virtual venue. The new music will also be available at HInkley's website, bryanporterhinkley.com.
 "That's just the style I'm doing now," said Hinkley. "I call it rock, really. I've always had pretty eclectic tastes. I love hardcore, punk, heavy metal, but I also grew up immersed in my mom's love of folk and bluegrass. I wanted to do an acoustic-based thing here. When people hear distorted guitar, they start to bang their heads and expect heavy metal. I wanted to make music you could listen to without being categorized as heavy rock. I think this style is more palatable for a wider audience, and I didn't want to limit myself to one audience. I wanted this record to be more open-ended, as far as who would want to listen to it."
 Hinkley's interest in many styles of music is reflected in the "day job" he has developed. His Gratitude Sound in Boston produces music for TV and radio ads, and also for TV shows and films. It allows him to use his creative side in a way he probably never imagined when he was growing up in Westwood as your typical rock fan, who also had a newspaper route delivering the Patriot Ledger.
 "For the past seven years I've been doing custom music for ads and I also license bands and performers getting their music into ads, or TV or films. I work with ad agencies that contact me and need a specific piece of music. I have a team of composers, besides myself, and we can do anything from hip-hop to orchestral music. It has been nice to be able to work in a different platform with a lot of my musical friends. Even before this, with streaming services, which are free or subscription, it had become tough for musical sales any other way. Vinyl has made a comeback, which is interesting, but the music market is not the same as it was in the 1990s. Change is inevitable I guess.
 "This business has definitely affected my own musical palette," Hinkley added. "When you're writing to someone's brief it forces you to do something you normally wouldn't. I've done some metal, some hip-hop, some quirky background music. But again, it's not always me writing and I know enough to get people who specialize in certain styles like hip-hop, and I stick to the styles I like to do."
 The demands of his studio work have limited Hinkley's performances recently, even before the pandemic put everyone on the sidelines. But a Tree reunion show at The Sinclair in Cambridge in 2015 -- with Never Got Caught opening -- was such an event Blue Hills Brewery produced a special Tree Beer for the occasion.
 "I've always had a small amount of stage fright, but I think it's a good thing," said Hinkley. "I had never played solo acoustic before, but seeing (Quincy's) Lenny Lashley and Jesse Ahern and how well they make it work really inspired me. Since my business tends to be all software, I really enjoy playing solo very much.
 "The new record is mostly me," Hinkley noted. "I've been working with ProTools for years and someone recommended a program called Able-ton that I used. But, it is essentially just me in my daughter's bedroom, which I turned into a little studio. I have a friend in Maryland who's a drummer and sent him my demos and he was excited. So, I was happy he agreed to do drums for me. Then, we brought it all to Mad Oak studio, located just above my business in Boston, and put it all together."

“We are a different team with these guys. This is the first time we’ve ever had two guys on the edge like that who are very special players. Normally we have to run the ball to set up the throw, so people have been caught off- guard.”
 After establishing a run-heavy attack with Ja’Nyrein Washington the last two years — passing the ball about 25% of the time — Ingman has redesigned the offense around the passing game.
 This year the Pirates are passing the ball 35% of the time and it’s resulted in big plays and lopsided wins.
 But despite how good the offense has been, it doesn’t quite work when one of the pieces is missing. Port Charlotte found that out the hard way as it struggled to finish drives against the Tigers.
 “I think it’s clear to everyone it didn’t benefit us,” Rogers said of missing Perry for the game at Palmetto. “It would have made it a lot easier on us having him out there. But it’s no excuse for the game.
 “I guess everything happens for a reason, though. That loss seems to have lit a fire under us these past couple of weeks.”
 Perry has taken the loss to heart, Ingman said, and his play on the field has reflected it — with 5 catches for 194 yards and 3 touchdowns.
 Last Friday in a blowout of Southeast, he flashed his game-changing ability by taking the first pass of the game for a 70-yard touchdown. Later that quarter, he broke free in the middle of the field and hauled in a 67-yard score.
 And it’s not just big touchdowns and leaping catches that have impressed Ingman and teammates, but also a change of heart toward the game.
 “They’re teenagers. They’re not perfect,” Ingman said of Perry being suspended. “At the end of the day we’re in this to help develop young people into men and when you get rid of someone you can’t help them anymore.
 “He’s really turned it around. Just turn the tape on and you can see it. He’s blocking downfield, he’s the first one to greet a Solomon or a Bear or a (running back) Jay (Pelham), whoever scores. He’s really been a tremendous teammate.”

KHARTOUM — An appeals court in the Sudanese capital has released the last of a group of 11 artists arrested almost two months ago and convicted for causing a "public nuisance", their lawyer said on Wednesday.
 Othman Al Basri told AFP that the last six members of the group, who were sentenced on September 25 to serve two years in jail, were freed on Tuesday.
 Last week, filmmaker Hajooj Kuka and four other artists also walked free.
 Kuka, along with other members of a collective called "Civic Lab" collective, were convicted for causing a "public nuisance" and breaking a curfew imposed over the coronavirus.
 The Civic Lab collective was formed in the wake of, and inspired by, the mass protests that last year brought down Sudan's autocratic ruler Omar Al Bashir.
 According to Sudanese activist Tahani Abbas, police arrested the 11 artists on August 10 while they were rehearsing a play following a complaint from neighbours.
 Kuka had in August said on Twitter that he and the others were "attacked during a theater workshop in #khartoum by islamists instigators. The police stood by the attackers and arrested us".
 Steven Markowitz, who produced Kuka's film "aKasha" — shown at the Venice film festival — took to Twitter to praise the decision.
 "Great news!! Hajooj and the four artists have just been released... International pressure made a difference," he wrote.
 Markowitz had condemned what he called the "fake charges" against the artists.
 Sudan is undergoing a delicate political transition under a joint civilian- military government formed on the back of months of protests following Bashir's ouster in April last year.
 Bashir had come to power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.

Back in Guyana, freedom of the press was always subject to discrimination and the democratic rights thwarted under the PNC/R government. The national press, media, TV and radio were all controlled and used by the PNC/R government for propaganda advertisement. As recently as March 2020 during the election, reporters and journalists were hassled, their presence was controlled and their autonomy was limited. Back in the Burnhamite days, publications with opposing views were demolished and demoralized. Reporters and journalists feared for their lives and Father Drake, editor for the Catholic Newspaper, was murdered by the House of Israel thugs, affiliated to the PNC, in broad daylight. Importation of papers was reduced and denied and circulation of news was at a risk. Organized thugs by the PNC roamed the streets and venues, ensuring that cameras and recording devices were forcefully taken away and destroyed (in the presence of the police), while many journalists suffered great physical injuries and their presence were not welcomed. Guyanese should ensure that those dark and ugly days never return to visit this land.
