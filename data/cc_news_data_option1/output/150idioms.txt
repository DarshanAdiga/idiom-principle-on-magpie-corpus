"It was awesome. There was one drive where we literally didn't pass the ball," Garoppolo said. "It was as excited as we've ever been offensively. When you can do that to a team, it makes it tough on defenses. They put more guys in the box, bring safeties down. We ran the hell out of the ball and those guys up front battled their ass of today.

Hong Kong's top judge on Monday delivered a passionate defence of the city's legal system as it struggles with a backlog of protester trials and accusations of bias from all sides.
 The semi-autonomous city has an independent, British-style judiciary -- viewed as one of the bedrocks of the financial hub's identity and a key factor differentiating it from mainland China.
 Its courts have been overloaded during seven months of sometimes violent democracy protests that have seen more than 6,500 people arrested, of whom around a thousand are undergoing or have completed legal proceedings.
 Since the protests began, "many commentaries have been given as to the work of the courts and many views have been expressed regarding our judges", Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma said.
 "A lot of these have been fair, but unfortunately, some have proceeded on misconceptions and misunderstandings," he added in a speech to mark the opening of the legal year.
 Ma, who will retire early next year, emphasised the impartiality of the judiciary and its obligation to ensure fair trials.
 "Judges look only to the letter of the law and to the spirit of the law, and nothing else. Political, economic or social considerations... simply do not enter into the equation," he said.
 In November, China condemned a Hong Kong court's decision to overturn a ban on face masks worn by democracy protesters, asserting that only Beijing can rule on constitutional issues.
 The same month, China's state-controlled Global Times tabloid published an editorial accusing Hong Kong's High Court and some judges of abusing their powers.
 Hong Kong enjoys freedoms unseen on the mainland as part of the "one country, two systems" deal made when colonial power Britain handed it back to China in 1997.
 But there are concerns that these liberties are being eroded by an increasingly authoritarian Beijing.
 Last month petrol bombs were thrown at the outside walls of the city's court houses, while graffiti was recently daubed across the High Court saying "Rule of law is dead" and accusing one judge of pro-China bias.
 At Monday's ceremony -- a traditional event where judges and lawyers wore wigs and robes -- Ma said both he and the public were committed to Hong Kong's "cherished" rule of law.
 He warned that without it, social unity was under threat.
 "We must do all our best to preserve it and to treasure it because once damaged, this is not something from which our community can easily recover," he said, adding that the right to protest was not an excuse for violence.
 Ma also acknowledged the high volume of legal cases generated by the protests and said plans were being put into place to handle the backlog more quickly.

The worst thing you can do as a mountain biker is to keep your weight back. As soon as you retreat behind the saddle you have limited range of motion and will start getting tugged in any direction that your bike lunges you in. This is because your arms have no range of motion and are basically pulling you over the bars as soon as your front wheel slides on a root, or plunges down a drop. Instead of going back when it‚Äôs steep get low! It‚Äôs okay to allow your hips to go behind the saddle when your bike dives at the front, but keep your head low and close to your bars and your elbows bent on the approach. That way when your bike dives - and it will, your head and body can remain neutral.

The story is different on the home turf. Some dance masters and newcomers compose dances for a paltry sum. The background dancers have no problem with the percentage system that is followed. If a choreographer comes from Mumbai or Chennai to Hyderabad they get a small percentage of their dancers while a majority is taken from here.
 Shekar currently has plenty of work and is actually letting go of certain assignments because of lack of dates. People are bored with set songs and intro songs and new directors are always trying different stuff. According to him, dancers are busy, but there is certainly a problem because of montages. ‚ÄúAlmost all the dances are designed by Hyderabadis and we have stopped hiring people from other states,‚Äù he says.
 Prasanna, a choreographer from Chennai who works for Brinda master says it is absurd to blame directors for lack of work. Montage or a duet is based on the script. Only if there is a necessity for a song and a dance, we get work. Why would anyone need a dance master or background dancers for a film like _96_ (The Tamil film now being remade in Telugu as _Jaanu,_ starring Samantha and Sharwanand)?

Gold prices fell 1% on Monday as optimism
 in equity markets ahead of the signing of an interim U.S.-China
 trade deal and lack of further escalation in Middle East
 tensions diminished bullion's safe-haven appeal.
 The U.S.-China Phase 1 agreement is due to be signed at the
 White House on Wednesday.
 Spot gold dipped 0.7% to $1,551.25 per ounce as of
 1101 GMT, having fallen 1% to $1,546.27 earlier in the session.
 U.S. gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,552.10.
 "We are struggling (a) little bit with the details. It'll be
 quite interesting to see if there is any concrete guidance in
 the details of the phase-one deal," said Julius Baer analyst
 Carsten Menke.
 "Also, the news that the Chinese and the U.S. would meet on
 semi-annual basis to discuss trade, I imagine was something
 which wasn't expected by the market, and could be weighing on
 gold."
 A Wall Street Journal report said on Saturday Washington and
 Beijing had agreed to semi-annual talks aimed at pushing for
 reforms in both countries and resolving disputes.
 The positive sentiment ahead of the planned signing boosted
 global equities, which were hovering just below record levels,
 while the U.S. dollar gained against key rivals.
 Stronger appetite for riskier assets weighs on
 greenback-denominated gold.
 Bullion rose to a near 7-year peak of $1,610.90 last week
 after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in
 Baghdad and Iran launched missiles against U.S. bases in Iraq in
 retaliation.
 The rally, however, faded with a lack of further military
 escalation in the region.
 The United States imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday
 and vowed to tighten the economic screws if Tehran continued
 "terrorist" acts or pursued a nuclear bomb.
 "The tensions between U.S. and Iran seems to have calmed
 down a little bit, at least for the time being, and people are
 just taking profits on that," said Afshin Nabavi, senior vice
 president at precious metals trader MKS SA.
 Reflecting investor sentiment, holdings of the world's
 largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust ,
 fell 0.9% to 874.52 tonnes on Friday, their lowest since Sept.
 16\.
 On the technical front, gold is testing the support level of
 $1,550 and a fall below that would be a negative signal, opening
 space for further declines, Carlo Alberto De Casa, Chief analyst
 at ActivTrades said in a note.
 Elsewhere, palladium rose 0.8% to $2,133.34 an ounce.
 Silver was down 0.7% at $17.97, while platinum
 fell about 0.7% to $970.79.

Britain's economy has stalled, official data showed Monday, as Brexit and political uncertainty contributed to slashing manufacturing output, heaping pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates.
 Gross domestic product contracted 0.3 percent in November, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement. It grew only 0.1 percent in the three months to the end of November, the ONS added.
 Manufacturing meanwhile slumped 1.7 percent in November.
 Speaking ahead of the data a Bank of England policymaker, Gertjan Vlieghe, hinted at a potential vote in favour of a January cut to the BoE's main interest rate, weighing on the pound Monday.
 It followed comments Friday by fellow policymaker Silvana Tenreyro, who said she could support a rate cut from the current 0.75-percent level, if the economy did not strengthen.
 And on Thursday, the bank's outgoing governor, Mark Carney, said the monetary policy committee was looking at the merits of near-term stimulus.
 As for the latest GDP data, "a poor performance in November was always on the cards given that the uncertainties facing the economy were at a peak with the general election looming and doubts over what would happen on the Brexit front after it had been delayed again from 31 October", noted Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to financial researchers EY ITEM Club.
 "It is clear that businesses were cautious in their behaviour while it also appears that consumers were reluctant to spend."
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives convincingly won a general election in December that has broken the deadlock over the UK's departure from the European Union.
 Britain's parliament last week finally approved Brexit, ending years of arguments that toppled two UK governments.
 "We expect the economy to get a lift in the early months of 2020 from a more settled domestic political environment following the Conservatives substantial win... and an easing of near-term Brexit uncertainties as the UK leaves the EU with Johnson‚Äôs deal on 31 January," said Archer.

As Tallahassee fails to adequately fund education, social services and other needs, the state is at the same time trying to prevent local governments and school districts from picking up the slack.
   
 The Florida Legislature seems determined to stop local governments from doing much of anything other than cutting taxes and passing proclamations.
   
 Lawmakers have been working for years to weaken the home-rule power of local governments through so-called preemption laws. That trend has accelerated in recent years as lawmakers, backed by big contributions from corporate lobbyists, have sought to usurp local control over issues ranging from sunscreen bans to business regulations.
   
 From 2017 to 2019, a total of 119 bills were filed in the Legislature that contain some form of state preemption of local governments, according to a new report from the nonpartisan group Integrity Florida. At least 16 preemption bills have been filed for the 2020 legislative session, which starts next week.
   
 But the efforts of the GOP-controlled Legislature to hamstring local lawmakers go beyond preemption measures. As Tallahassee fails to adequately fund education, social services and other needs, the state at the same time is trying to prevent local governments and school districts from picking up the slack.
   
 A measure introduced for the second straight year aims to make it more difficult to raise taxes on the local level. The legislation, House Joint Resolution 477, would put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot that would require any city, county or school board to have a two-thirds majority to approve any tax increase.
   
 The measure comes after another state constitutional amendment was passed that requires a two-thirds vote of the Legislature for any increase in a state tax or fee. The nonpartisan Florida Policy Institute has published multiple reports cautioning that the requirement puts communities in a precarious position during the next recession or after a natural disaster, preventing such things as food assistance and temporary housing from being provided.
   
 "It goes without saying that allowing a 34% minority to dictate investment decisions is dangerous, particularly in the face of Florida's projected revenue shortfall in the coming years," Florida Policy Institute CEO Sadaf Knight wrote in a column for Palm Beach Post.
   
 Local citizens have shown they understand the need to make up for the Legislature's shortsighted approach to such priorities as funding education. For example, 20 local tax referendums were put before voters in 2018 -- and all 20 passed. (Volusia County's ill-fated sales tax vote in 2019 was an outlier.)
   
 As for preemption laws, Gov. Ron DeSantis last year provided a rare victory for home rule by vetoing legislation that would have preempted local governments from banning plastic straws. At the time, he wrote that "the state should simply allow local communities to address this issue through the political process ... by electing people who share their views."
   
 DeSantis should take his own advice by opposing the latest round of preemption measures and the two-thirds requirement for local tax increases.

The death sentence for Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf was annulled on Monday after a higher court overruled the original ruling.
 The High Court in the eastern city of Lahore ruled that the formation of the special tribunal that that handed down the sentence was unconstitutional and "illegal," Musharraf's legal team as well as government prosecutors said.
 "The filing of the complaint, the constitution of the court, the selection of the prosecution team are illegal, declared to be illegal ... And at the end of the day the full judgment has been set aside," Ishtiaq A. Khan, the prosecutor representing the government, told news agency AFP.
 Prosecutors can still file a new case against Musharraf with the approval of the federal Cabinet.
 Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan between 1999 and 2008, was sentenced to death in absentia by the tribunal in December on treason charges concerning his decision to suspend the constitution and impose a state of emergency in 2007.
 Two out of three judges on the special court ruled that Musharraf was guilty of trying to purge higher judiciary officials to avoid legal challenges to his rule.
 Musharraf, who now lives in exile in Dubai, overthrew the government of then- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless military coup in 1999.

Whoa, 47 carries?! That is a franchise record for a playoff game. The 49ers' first playoff game since the 2013 NFC Championship Game brought with it a surprise 100-yard rusher: Tevin Coleman. He ran hard, especially at the end and in the red zone. Coleman had a season-high 22 carries for 105 yards and two touchdowns, after just one TD in his previous nine games. With 58 timely yards, Raheem Mostert (more on him below) averaged 4.8 yards per carry like Coleman, neither of whom broke a run longer than 11 yards. Matt Breida had just 17 carries on eight yards, and most concerning is his late-game fumble, three games after fumbling twice against Atlanta.

Firstly, you need to select the type of savings account you would like. Online comparison sites can help you consider the level of access you want to your savings, how you would like to manage your account and what sort of interest rate you can achieve. As a general rule of thumb, if you lock your money away for a decent period of time, you are likely to achieve a higher interest rate than if you select an easy access account.

  Given the context of the day Everton were always in danger of being totally overshadowed, especially as they have little left to play for this season.


  But while the Toffees may not have needed Saturday's points, their under- pressure manager Roberto Martinez was in dire need of a proud and professional performance from his side.


  However, they were far too accommodating of their opponents in the first half, essentially extending their pre-match guard of honour to allow City a match-winning hold on the game before the break.

BELFAST -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Northern Ireland on Monday to mark the restoration of the British province's devolved executive after three years and to hold talks with Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar.
 Parties representing Irish nationalists and pro-British unionists on Saturday ended a three-year standoff that had threatened a key part of the region's 1998 peace settlement by forming a new power-sharing administration.
 Johnson met First Minister Arlene Foster of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Irish nationalists Sinn Fein on arrival at the Stormont estate, seat of the Northern Ireland government.
 Varadkar and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney were due to arrive later for talks, an Irish government spokesman said.
 Before the 1998 peace deal, Northern Ireland suffered three decades of sectarian violence between Irish nationalist militants seeking a united Ireland and pro-British loyalists defending the region's place in the United Kingdom.
 The so-called Good Friday Agreement established the Assembly - a devolved legislature with a power-sharing leadership which has administrative responsibility for the province and can make new laws in areas such as the economy, finance and healthcare.
 That arrangement collapsed in 2017 when Sinn Fein withdrew, saying it was not being treated equally by the DUP.
 The deal to restore the executive came just weeks after Johnson secured a big majority in the British parliament, ending his party's dependence on DUP votes.
 Johnson said he planned to use the visit to press the need for public service reform and to help resolve a strike in the health service.
 The British government had promised more money to help Northern Ireland fund public services if it could get its devolved administration up and running again, but it has not publicly disclosed a figure.

As the UK ad watchdog, we have to weigh the legitimate rights of an advertiser to promote legally available products that can be, and by and large are, consumed responsibly by the majority of consumers with the need to protect vulnerable groups, including children, from harm.


  In doing so, we must look at the direct impact advertising can have on people‚Äôs choices and write rules that restrict their exposure accordingly. Of course, we must also be mindful of the many other factors that contribute, above and beyond advertising, to rates of childhood obesity or problem drinking ‚Äì think sedentary lifestyles, education, parental influence and the affordability of healthier alternatives.


  The evidence around the impact advertising has on people‚Äôs choices can change over time. When it does, our rules must evolve to reflect those changes.


  Our New Year‚Äôs resolution is to ensure we continue to have an open and healthy conversation with the Scottish Government, ministers and officials, as well as other organisations across Scotland, to ensure that our regulation remains in the right place.

"Just Mercy" is a drama of immense power; his view of the possibility of individual triumphs over systematic persecution is cautiously optimistic, and his portrayal of the dysfunctional justice system itself contemplates the possibility of progress. However, for all the glimmers of hope that the film offers, it remains particularly impersonal. It is not a bio-photo, because there is very little bio in the film. Stevenson's heroism is monumental - both in size and in form. Her parents are seen in a brief early glimpse; otherwise, the film shows almost nothing from his personal life - mainly, that he is a follower and a runner. The action spanned six years, from 1987 to 1993, but it limited Stevenson to his professional duties. Besides, he is embarking on a rather brilliant large-scale strategy which propels the affair under the national spotlights, but this seems to happen in the blink of an eye, without any sense of his strategy or his effectiveness in scenes. action involving a large network of connections. The barriers to such dramatic intimacy are endemic to current cinema and, in particular, to political films based on true stories, in which there is little room to depart from the main narrative of events - and a reluctance to go to the - beyond the documented file of public or parapublic activities. Yet the result is that Stevenson presents himself as a principled, courageous and brilliant lawyer, rather than as a complete person who does such historic work; it remains opaque.

Yamaha has warned musicians in Japan against stuffing themselves into their instrument cases to mimic the escape technique allegedly used by fugitive ex- tycoon Carlos Ghosn.
 Ghosn, who faces financial misconduct charges in Japan, managed to slip past authorities at the end of December reportedly by smuggling himself on board a plane inside an audio equipment box.
 The 65-year-old has refused to shed light on how he ghosted out of Japan to Lebanon, but that has not stopped a string of internet users "playing Ghosn" by posing in cases usually meant to protect big instruments.
 In one picture posted to Twitter, a young woman curled up inside a padded green harp case, while another post appeared to show somebody standing in a double bass gig bag.
 The stunts have not chimed with Japanese instrument manufacturer Yamaha, however, who sounded a note of caution warning people against the trend.
 "There have been a large number of tweets showing people climbing into large instrument cases," tweeted Yamaha Wind Stream, the company's account for information on wind instruments.
 "To avoid the possibility of a tragic accident, please do not do this... Musical instrument and audio equipment cases are designed to hold musical instruments and audio equipment. Please use them correctly."
 Ghosn, arrested on financial misconduct charges in 2018, jumped bail and fled in mysterious circumstances to Lebanon, where he gave a rambling press conference last week.
 The Wall Street Journal reported that he was snuck on to a private jet in Osaka in a large case for audio equipment, which was later found at the back of the cabin.
 The newspaper cited unnamed sources close to the investigation in Turkey as saying that holes had been drilled into the container to ensure the businessman could breathe.
 The report was accompanied by a picture of a large black case which The Wall Street Journal claimed was the one used by Ghosn.

So, I want to get to the bottom of this.
 Is there a link between human-caused climate change and extreme fire?
 For answers, I'm looking at peer-reviewed research papers and talking to Dr. Andrew Dessler, a climatologist at Texas A&M University.
 ‚ÄúDoes climate change play a role in these extreme fire events?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Dessler said.
 ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I followed up.
 ‚ÄúI would say climate change might interact with these events the way steroids might interact with a baseball game. Steroids don't hit home runs, never go to the plate. But what steroids do is take a hitter with warning-track power and they allow that hitter to hit the ball out,‚Äù Dessler said.
 The conclusion of an overwhelming majority of climate scientists is the burning of coal and other fossil fuels has spiked the atmosphere with more carbon dioxide then we've had in 400,000 years. And that's raised global average temperatures by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Dessler is saying the warmer temperatures, caused by climate change, do not cause extreme events. Instead, they make extreme events more likely.
 ‚ÄúThis is really not rocket science. If I take a bunch of vegetation and I dry it out it's going to burn better,‚Äù Dessler said. ‚ÄúOn average, in a warmer climate, you're going to get more intense events. More intense heatwaves, more intense droughts and more intense fires."
 ‚ÄúSo that's what's happening right now?‚Äù I asked.
 ‚ÄúThat's what's happening. Get used to it,‚Äù he said.

Instead, family and friends gathered in Darling's front yard Sunday to mourn her.


  "Meagan was like family to me," Perkins said at the vigil. "No different than a blood sister."


  Denton police said Darling, who is a mother of four children, was shot and killed in the home she was so proud of Friday evening. The Denton County Medical Examiner said Sunday that Darling had been shot in the head.


  Denton police quickly arrested 28-year-old Xavier Patterson on a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police said Patterson placed a call to 911, then hung up. He was found in one of the bedrooms, police said.


  Friends and family say Patterson was Darling's on-again, off-again boyfriend and the father of her two youngest children, a 2-year-old and a 9-month-old. Those children are now in foster care, according to CPS.


  Patterson has a long criminal history, mainly involving drugs. Denton police said the investigation into the fatal shooting was ongoing, and charges could be enhanced.


  "We'd get the text messages and hear the stories," Perkins said. "They were just traumatic, and we begged her to leave.


  "A lot of tears were shed and she was in pain a lot," she added.


  Jenkins said Darling had kicked Patterson out just hours before she was shot. Mourners wore purple to a vigil Sunday to encourage domestic violence victims.


  "Seek help, especially if there's children involved. Just seek help. Someone will help you," Jenkins said.


  People described Darling as a strong woman with a beautiful voice and a heart of gold.


  "I miss her much," said former brother-in-law Raymond Sibley. "So much."


  Darling's oldest two children attended the vigil Sunday along with their father, who was too emotional to speak.

"That always helps when people are trying to zone you," Schweyen said of her team's perimeter shooting. "We got good looks in zone against Eastern, a lot of wide-open threes."


  Another key to success for Montana will be ball distribution. The Lady Griz were highly effective finding the open shooter against Eastern's zone. They piled up 23 assists on 29 baskets.


  "We still have a long way to go, but (Thursday) was one of our better games," said Johnston, who collected 10 assists in the win over Eastern. "I think it was the most complete 40 minutes our whole team has played. So it's good to see that right now."


  Just as promising right now is the overall health of the Lady Griz. Madi Schoening played with a broken finger against Eastern but still managed to score 10 points. Abby Anderson continued to be effective in the post despite wrapping on her ankle and hamstring and guard Sophia Stiles was effective, especially on the defensive end, despite wearing a brace on her injured right shoulder.


  "She's always going to give you amazing minutes on D and she gets after people," Schweyen said of Stiles. "She causes a lot of havoc. Plus she's a great passer. A very unselfish player."

Iran's government on Monday denied a "cover-up" after it took days for the armed forces to admit a Ukrainian airliner was shot down by mistake last week.
 The comments came after a second night of demonstrations in Tehran against the authorities over the air disaster, according to videos shared on social media.
 The Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 was shot down shortly after it took off from Tehran before dawn on Wednesday, killing all 176 passengers and crew on board.
 The Kiev-bound airliner was brought down hours after Iran had launched a wave of missiles at US troops stationed at Iraqi bases in retaliation for the killing of a top Iranian general.
 The Islamic republic initially denied Western claims based on US intelligence that the passenger plane had been struck by a missile before admitting it on Saturday.
 "In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities," said government spokesman Ali Rabiei.
 "Some officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case," he said in remarks aired on state television.
 "Lying is intentionally and knowingly faking the truth. Lying is covering up. Lying is knowing a fact and not expressing it or twisting the truth."
 Rabiei said all details provided by officials prior to Saturday's admission had been based on the information available to them at the time.
 "All of those who expressed opinions on those days, at the peak of America's psychological war against the Iranian nation... did so based on existing information at the time."
 \- 'Thorough investigation' -
 President Hassan Rouhani promised a "thorough investigation" into the air disaster in a telephone call with Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Lofven on Sunday night, his office said.
 The majority of the people on Flight PS752 were Iranians and Canadians, including dual nationals, and other victims were Ukrainians, Afghans and Britons.
 There were seven Swedish citizens as well as 10 people who reside in the EU member country.
 "We must strive to ensure that such a shocking incident is not repeated anywhere in the world," Rouhani said, quoted in a statement published on his government's website.
 Rouhani noted that the disaster occurred at a time of heightened tensions in the region after a US drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3.
 "We must all join hands to bring security back to the region and allow peace to prevail," the Iranian president said.
 Iran has invited experts from Canada, France, Ukraine and the United States to take part in the investigation into the air disaster.

Should Greta Gerwig ("Little Women") or another female director make the cut in 2020, she will become just the sixth woman nominated for Best Director in the Academy's 92-year history.

The Lahore High Court on January 13 annulled the death sentence handed to former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, ruling that the special court which had found him guilty of treason last year was unconstitutional, a government prosecutor told _AFP_.
 The original ruling had marked the first time a former leader of the armed forces had faced such a sentence for treason in Pakistan, where the military maintains strong influence and senior officers are often considered immune from prosecution.
 It caused a wave of controversy, with Mr. Musharraf ‚Äî exiled in Dubai ‚Äî slamming it as a ‚Äúvendetta‚Äù and the military expressing its disappointment.
 The High Court ruled it ‚Äúillegal‚Äù on Monday. ‚ÄúThe filing of the complaint, the constitution of the court, the selection of the prosecution team are illegal, declared to be illegal... And at the end of the day the full judgment has been set aside,‚Äù the prosecutor representing the government, Ishtiaq A. Khan said.
 ‚ÄúYes, he is a free man. Right now there is no judgment against him any longer,‚Äù Mr. Khan added.
 The prosecution now has the option to file a new case against Mr. Musharraf with the approval of the federal Cabinet. The treason trial ‚Äî which began in 2013 and is just one of several involving Musharraf ‚Äî centred on his decision to suspend the Constitution and impose emergency rule in 2007. The case went on for years amid repeated delays until the surprise announcement last year.
 The imposition of emergency had sparked widespread protests against Mr. Musharraf, ultimately leading to his resignation in the face of impeachment proceedings.

The forest a series of Douglas Fir, Sitka Spruce and Cedars trunks supporting their foliage high up in the air became our inspiration for the tectonic of the house. The house structure organized around one proportioned concrete column rising out of the floor mimics the trees' trunks in size and scale. This column, along with the wood stove pipe, recreate and integrate the house with the rhythm of the forest.
 When one looks up from the forest floor one becomes aware of the protection provided by the large branches that spread from the trunks of the trees with the light filtering through the dense filigree of the needles. The meandering ridge beam that branches along the main space supports a thin slat wood ceiling meant to evoke the canopy of these surrounding conifers.

On the road, the 4Runner is only adequate. Sure, it keeps up with traffic just fine, and you know, turns and stops, but it's not exactly pleasing to drive on pavement. At the end of the day, the 4Runner is a truck and it behaves like one -- well, one from a decade or so ago, since that's how old its underpinnings are. While newer midsize trucks are much smoother on the road, the 4Runner is stiff and bouncy, jouncing along the highway. If you plan to use your new SUV for commuting, something like the new Toyota Highlander or smaller RAV4 are probably a better bet.
 However, if your goal is to get out and enjoy the great outdoors, the 4Runner is an excellent choice. The TRD Off-Road and TRD Pro trims come with an electronically locking rear differential, a Multi-Terrain Select four-wheel drive system and Crawl Control, all of which help drivers scamper up and over obstacles like they ain't no thang. For more impressions of those features, take a look at my earlier test where I took a 4Runner on a trip from Moab, Utah, over to the mountains to Ouray, Colorado.

The man accused of stabbing at least five people in a machete rampage at the home of a Hasidic rabbi during a Hanukkah celebration is due to face federal hate crime charges in White Plains, New York, on Monday.


  A federal grand jury indicted Grafton Thomas, 37, late last week with additional counts of hate crimes for the Dec. 28 stabbing of members of the Orthodox Jewish community in Monsey, New York, bringing the number of federal charges he faces to 10.


  Each count carries a maximum prison term of life.


  One of the victims, a 72-year-old man who suffered devastating machete blows to his head, arm and neck, is comatose and unlikely to recover, according to family members.


  Federal prosecutors have said Thomas targeted his victims because of their Jewish faith. In a criminal complaint filed last month, they cited journals they seized from the suspect's home containing references to Adolf Hitler, Nazi culture and the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, identified by experts in extremism as an anti-Jewish hate group.


  Thomas also faces state charges for the attack, which his attorney, pointing to his client's long history of mental illness, has said was likely an expression of psychosis rather than bigotry.


  The attack in Monsey capped a string of incidents in which Jews have been physically attacked or accosted in the New York metropolitan area in recent weeks, including a shooting at a kosher supermarket in New Jersey that left two members of the Hasidic community dead.


  One of the suspects in that attack had also expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites. He died in the attack.


  The most recent national numbers from Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism found 780 anti-Semitic incidents reported to or detected by the organization in the United States in the first half of 2019, compared to 785 incidents reported for the same period in 2018.

 But not every Telugu film these days is packaged with song and dance numbers. The recent _Mathu Vadhalara_ , for instance, was a concept-based film where the music score was blended into the narrative.
 The past few years has a seen a steady decline in item dances and mass numbers in Telugu cinema, mainly because of the increase in content-based, realistic stories. New-age directors find it odd to include a duet in the middle of a serious narration. Even then we have the occasional low budget ‚ÄòShambho Shiva Shambo‚Äô song of Sampoornesh Babu in _Kobbari Matta_ and the ‚ÄòDimag Kharaab‚Äô dance from _Ismart Shankar_ that has the audience going berserk with the music and the moves.
