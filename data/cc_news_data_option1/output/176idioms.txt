Boris Johnson has called on Donald Trump to come up with an alternative to the Iran nuclear accord as Britain, France and Germany formally accused the Islamic republic of non-compliance In a drastic step that could ultimately lead to the deal's collapse, European signatories said yesterday they had "no choice" but to trigger a dispute resolution mechanism after Iran said it would ignore limitations on uranium enrichment and centrifuge research. Under the 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US to restrict its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Mr Trump pulled the US out and reimposed sanctions in 2018. Iran began a staged suspension of its own commitments in response last May, and last week announced it would no longer accept limits on its uranium enrichment. Britain, France and Germany have so far resisted US demands to also quit the deal, insisting it is the only way to stop Iran getting a bomb. But in a dramatic change of tack, British Prime Minister Mr Johnson suggested that the deal could be replaced with one negotiated by the US president. "The problem with the JCPOA is that from the American perspective, it's a flawed agreement, plus it was negotiated by President Obama," he told the BBC. He added that a replacement "Trump deal" would be a way out of the crisis. Iran has previously ruled out renegotiating the deal and it is unclear whether it would entertain talks on a fresh agreement with Mr Trump, who may not be in office after November's presidential elections. In a joint statement, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said the dispute mechanism had been triggered in an effort to buy time for the US and Iran to ease tensions. "We do this in good faith with the objective of preserving the JCPOA and in the sincere hope of finding a way forward to resolve the impasse through constructive diplomatic dialogue," they said. Iran's foreign ministry accused the E3 of seeking to "abuse" the process, and threatened unspecified "consequences". Iran said it would return to full compliance with the deal if the US lifted all sanctions, and added that it was continuing to allow inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor its programmes under the agreement. Meanwhile, Iran said yesterday it had arrested people accused of a role in shooting down a Ukrainian airliner and had also detained 30 people involved in protests that have swept the nation for four days since the military belatedly admitted its error. The downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, which killed all 176 people aboard, has created a new crisis for the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers. President Hassan Rouhani promised a thorough investigation into the "unforgivable error" in an address yesterday. It was the latest in a series of apologies by the leadership that has done little to quell public anger. Tehran has faced an escalating confrontation with the West and a wave of unrest since the US killed Iran's most powerful military commander in a drone strike on January 3. Iran shot down the plane last Wednesday when its military was on high alert, hours after firing missiles at US targets in Iraq. It admitted the mistake on Saturday after days of denials. New security camera footage shows two missiles, fired 30 seconds apart, hitting the plane after take-off, the 'New York Times' reported yesterday. A person who posted a video online last week of a missile striking the plane has been taken into custody by the elite Revolutionary Guards, the Fars news agency reported. Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said some of those accused of having a role in the plane disaster had been arrested, although he did not say how many or identify them. Since the official admission, protesters, many of them students, have held daily demonstrations, chanting "Clerics get lost!"

FAYETTEVILLE -- Traditionally the Kentucky Wildcats are the one SEC team that can beat you three times even if you play them just once.
 Distracted teams have been known to lose their game ahead of Kentucky in part because they look ahead to Kentucky. Then they lose to Kentucky and lose the next one off a Kentucky hangover.
 Or, the euphoria of beating Kentucky often drains the adrenaline for the next game.
 Arkansas Coach Eric Musselman, no doubt, would like to be crossing that post euphoria bridge after his Razorbacks host Kentucky in Saturday's 3 p.m. ESPN televised game at Walton Arena.
 But for now Musselman says he and his 13-2, 2-1 in the SEC Razorbacks focus only on the Vanderbilt Commodores, 8-7, 0-2 coming to Walton for Wednesday's 7:30 p.m. SEC Network televised SEC game.
 Given the Commodores record and losing SEC leading scorer Aaron Nesmith and his 23.0 scoring average to a season ending stress fractured foot, Musselman was asked Monday if he's concerned his Hogs could peek ahead to Saturday's Kentucky clash.
 "It's a concern just because it was brought up," Musselman said. "I mean we've got thing to worry about and it's how do we get ready for Wednesday's game. That's it. It's the most important game on our schedule. They played Auburn great the other night on the road. We have to get ready to figure out how to play Vandy. It's plain and simple."
 One obvious Arkansas concern is finding depth behind its tallest starter, Adrio Bailey, the 6-6 senior forward playing center.
 Playing five guards, inserting Jalen Harris among starters Jimmy Whitt, Mason Jones, Isaiah Joe and Desi Sills with Jones and Whitt most cast as sort of centers, often has been Musselman's answer because 6-8 sophomore Reggie Chaney and 6-7 graduate transfer Jeantal Cylla have been inconsistent.
 However Cylla did grab five rebounds in 11 off the bench minutes of last Saturday's 76-72 SEC success at Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss.
 Does Saturday's performance bode for more time for the grad transfer adjusting to stepping up a division having previously played for the University of North Carolina-Wilmington?
 " I don't know if we'll see him more or less or at all or a lot," Musselman said Monday. "He rebounded the ball, he had five rebounds in 11 minutes. I think he was one of our leaders and he only played 11 minutes so I loved J.C's activity for sure. Rebounding the ball, that's obviously an area of deficiency for us."
 Then again …
 "Having said that he was 1 for 4 from the foul line," Musselman said. "I think that's a confidence thing and a rust thing. Put that on me because I haven't played him a lot."
 Cylla, Chaney and 6-8 sophomore Ethan Henderson, three blocked shots and three rebounds in seven minutes back on Dec. 3 against Austin Peay, have all had their moments.
 Lately though, Harris for Bailey has often been the substitution pattern, particularly late game if Bailey is foul-troubled.
 "We've proven through the course of three league games that there might be nights that we play five guards," Musselman said. "Every game we play this year there will probably be a stretch where there are five guards out there. We just wing it and see how it goes and then, if it doesn't go good, we'll get them out as quick as possible. And if it goes well and there are some matchups that we can take advantage of then we'll leave them out there a little longer."
 WOMEN'S MIDWEEK REST
 Off their 90-73 SEC victory over Missouri Sunday at Walton, coach Mike Neighbors' Razorbacks women, 14-3, 2-2 in the SEC, get one of their two in season midweek byes.
 Neighbors don't play again until Sunday's SEC game at Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tenn.
 No midweek game provides a little more healing time for hard-luck senior center Kiara Williams. A 3-year Razorbacks letter-winner out of Little Rock Central and regular starter the previous two seasons, a preseason foot injury limited Williams to just six games off the bench. She injured her other foot last week and watched the Missouri game in street clothes.
 "The initial report was we don't think it will be as long as last time," Neighbors said.

Katie Davis remembers being inspired watching the U.S. Women's Hockey team during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
 She was holding her own against the boys while playing in the Idaho Junior Steelheads Youth Hockey program. There wasn't a girls team in the program and watching the Americans win a silver medal opened her eyes to pursuing a career on an all-women's hockey team.
 Less than six years later, the Meridian native was representing the United States in international competition.
 Davis made the U.S. Under-18 Women's National Hockey team over the summer and appeared in all five games for the Americans at the IIHF Under-18 Women's World Championship in Bratislava, Slovakia, over the Christmas holiday. The tournament culminated with a 2-1 overtime win against Canada in the Gold Medal game on Jan. 2.
 “The goal in the future is Olympics and this was a good stepping stone in terms of my first international tournament and getting my foot in the door with USA Hockey and the coaches,” said Davis. “The relationships I built with the different coaches and getting familiar with the program is big. USA Hockey has a gold standard and having that opportunity being young is very special.”
 While the forward didn't record any stats at the tournament, making the team this year was extra special for Davis. She had tried out in previous years at open tryouts with the U-18 team, but didn't make it until her final year of eligibility. Davis, who turned 18 last week, now sets her eyes on the U22 team, whose tryouts are invitation only. She hopes that by getting a chance to showcase her talents on an international level before aging out of the U18 level, it will increase her chances of getting one of those invitations.
 She also participated in the U18 Rivalry series, a set of three games between the U.S. and Canada played this past August in Lake Placid, New York. Davis appeared in all three games, scoring a goal and recording two assists.
 “Going to world championships and having international play opened my eyes to wanting to play hockey,” Davis said. “In USA Hockey there's three words — hungry, humble, relentless. It's a lifestyle and as a player and person I'm buying into the USA Hockey mantra. Given the opportunity I'd love to play hockey as long as I can.”
 But even if another chance at playing for the United States doesn't come, Davis and her family made the most of the experience. Her parents, Patty and John, as well as her two older brothers, Matt and Vince, all made the trip to Slovakia to take in the experience.
 “We don't know if she'll ever wear the stars and stripes again,” Patty Davis, said. “We'd like to see it, but it was on the bucket list. So we went out there and cheered with the other families and we enjoyed the experience.”
 To help booster Katie's career, the Davis family moved from Idaho to Minnesota, where Davis has scored 10 goals and recorded six assists through 13 games of her senior season at Edina High, the three-time defending Minnesota state champions.
 The move to Minnesota came before her junior season after spending the first two years of her high school career at a boarding school in Rochester, New York, while playing for Selects Hockey Academy. The development-based showcase program has college coaches from around the country come and watch. The program helped Davis improve as a player, but something was missing.

Finally, players have historically struggled with their travel accommodations. The league regularly cut corners by shipping teams from game to game via connecting flights that left them with insufficient time to prepare for the next contest. Players more often than not were seated in coach, and some - like Phoenix Mercury star Brittney Griner, who is 6-foot-8 - were sometimes seated in the middle of a row on a plane. And only veteran players were given their own rooms in hotels for away games.
