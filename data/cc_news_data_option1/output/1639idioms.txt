CLARENCE Valley residents are in danger of catching mosquito-borne diseases like Barmah Forest virus and Ross River Fever as the danger season for the insects extends into autumn.
 The North Coast Public Health Unit said residents should protect themselves against mosquitoes which have remained in high numbers late in the season.
 ‚ÄúMosquitoes have persisted in large numbers through to early autumn, along with the warm weather in recent weeks,‚Äù senior environmental health officer Paul Williamson said.
 The NSW Arbovirus Surveillance and Mosquito Monitoring Program recently detected Barmah Forest virus and Ross River virus in mosquitoes in the Northern NSW area.
 Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses are common on the north coast and are transmitted by infected mosquitoes.
 So far this year, 32 north coast residents have been diagnosed with Barmah Forest virus infection and 153 with Ross River virus infections, which is two and three times the number of infections, respectively, for the same period last year.
 In the past four weeks 119 infections have been reported, which is six times the number reported in the same period last year.
 ‚ÄúThese infections can cause symptoms including tiredness, rash, fever, and sore and swollen joints. The symptoms usually resolve after several days, but some people may experience these symptoms for weeks or even months,‚Äù Mr Williamson said.
 Avoiding mosquito bites will be especially important until cooler weather brings an end to the mosquito-breeding season.
 While most people are at home due to current movement restrictions, many people are heading outdoors early or late in the day to get some exercise.
 ‚ÄúMosquitoes are very active at these times so protect yourself from being bitten by mosquitoes when out-and-about.‚Äù
 Simple steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes include:
 ‚Ä¢ Cover up as much as possible when outside with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear.
 ‚Ä¢ Use an effective insect repellent on exposed skin. Re-apply repellent within a few hours, as protection wears off with perspiration. The best mosquito repellents contain Diethyl Toluamide (DEET) or Picaridin. Botanical based products (e.g. eucalyptus, citronella etc.) provide only limited periods of protection.
 ‚Ä¢ Use physical barriers such as netting on prams, cots and play areas for babies. Repellents should not be used on the skin of children under the age of three months.
 ‚Ä¢ Check the product label of repellents for recommended age of use. Most skin repellents are safe to use for children over the age of 3 months or older. Some formulations are only suitable for children over 12 months.
 ‚Ä¢ Use insecticide sprays, vapour dispensing units (indoors) and mosquito coils (outdoors) to clear rooms or repel mosquitoes from an area.
 ‚Ä¢ Cover all windows, doors, vents and other entrances with insect screens.
 ‚Ä¢ Remove and prevent mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as emptying containers that hold water.
 ‚ÄúPreventing infection with these viruses depends on avoiding mosquito bites, especially as the mosquitoes have become active after recent rain, warm days and high tides,‚Äù Mr Williamson said.

 Staton was among the Raiders‚Äô offensive leaders this season, finishing with a .400 batting average and seven RBIs.
 Sophomore Tyler Triche led the team in batting average (.412) and doubles (4).
 ‚ÄúWe knew he was pretty solid, but he came out on fire,‚Äù Cahill said. ‚ÄúHe was hitting in the middle of the lineup and he was doing a great job playing second base.‚Äù
 Morrison (.333), sophomore Kaiden Ellis (.324) and freshman Logan Curry (.316) also enjoyed quick starts to the season, with Ellis leading the team with eight RBis.
 North Forsyth‚Äôs pitching staff finished with a 1.48 ERA, which was anchored by the Raiders‚Äô three main starters ‚Äî DiMola, Ackerman and Barfield ‚Äî who had a combined 1.04 ERA.
 Ackerman led the team with three wins and struck out 27 batters in 13 1/3 innings.
 DiMola, Gilbert and Staton each said their favorite memory while playing for North Forsyth is when the Raiders swept second-seeded Archer out of the Class 7A playoffs last year.
 North Forsyth beat Archer 4-1 in 10 innings in the first game of the doubleheader, then outlasted the Tigers 2-1 in eight innings, as the series win carried the Raiders into the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2016.

Citing an unidentified source inside the country, it said Kim, who is in his mid-30s, had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.
 Soon afterwards, CNN reported that Washington was "monitoring intelligence" that Kim was in "grave danger" after undergoing surgery, quoting what it said was an anonymous US official.
 US President Donald Trump on Thursday rejected reports that Kim was ailing but declined to state when he was last in touch with him.
 On Monday, the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported that Kim had sent a message of thanks to workers on the giant Wonsan Kalma coastal tourism project.
 It was the latest in a series of reports in recent days of statements issued or actions taken in Kim's name, although none has carried any pictures of him.
 Satellite images reviewed by 38North, a US-based think tank, showed a train probably belonging to Kim at a station in Wonsan last week.
 It cautioned that the train's presence did not "indicate anything about his health" but did "lend weight" to reports he was staying on the country's eastern coast.
 Reporting from inside the isolated North is notoriously difficult, especially regarding anything to do with its leadership, which is among its most closely guarded secrets.
 Previous absences from the public eye on Kim's part have prompted speculation about his health.
 In 2014 he dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South's spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.

SYDNEY -- Asian shares bounced on Monday as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced more stimulus steps to help cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus, while oil took another spill as the world ran short of space to store it all.
 MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2% in early trade, taking back some of last week's 2.6% decline. Japan's Nikkei gained 2.1%, and Chinese blue chips 1%.
 E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 1.8% and FTSE futures 1.2%.
 The BOJ matched market speculation by pledging to buy unlimited amounts of government bonds, removing its previous target of 80 trillion yen per year.
 It raised purchases of corporate and commercial debt, and eased rules for what debt would qualify.
 The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meet later in the week, with the latter likely to do more.
 "For the Fed, no further developments on QE or interest rates are expected, but we expect it to underline that its policies will be in place indefinitely to support the economy," ANZ wrote in a research note.
 "We expect the ECB to raise the size of its emergency bond buying package (PEPP) by around 500 billion euros to 1.250 trillion and to continue pressing for a sizeable fiscal stimulus."
 On the data front, the United States and European Union release GDP for the first quarter and the influential U.S. ISM survey on manufacturing.
 Earnings season will be in full swing with around 173 companies in the S&P 500 reporting this week, including Apple, Amazon <AMZN.O, Facebook, Microsoft, Caterpillar , Ford, General Electric and Chevron .
 Analysts expect a 15% decline in S&P 500 first-quarter earnings, with profits for the energy sector estimated to slump more than 60%, raising fears of debt defaults, layoffs and possible bankruptcies.
 Bond markets remain well supported by the truly massive easing under way from major central banks, which have seen U.S. 10-year yields trade around 0.6% for a week or more.
 The dollar has been generally bid thanks to its safe haven status as the world's most liquid currency at times of stress, though moves have been relatively mild in recent weeks.
 The dollar index touched a three-week high at 100.860 on Friday before easing back to 100.150 on Monday.
 The euro was steady at $1.0823, having hit a one-month low of $1.0725 on Friday, while the dollar was flat on the yen at 107.34.
 Gold held at $1,722 per ounce, after gaining 2.5% last week.
 Oil prices looked set for another volatile week, having fallen in eight of the last nine weeks. U.S. crude even traded below zero last week as demand collapsed 30% due to the pandemic, leaving more oil than could be stored.
 U.S. crude slid $1.33 to $13.61, while Brent crude futures slipped 8 cents to $21.36 a barrel.

But health experts worry that having the drug easily available at a time of heightened public fear could make it easier to misuse it. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned doctors against prescribing the drug, hydroxychloroquine, for treating the coronavirus outside of hospitals or research settings because of reports of serious side effects, including dangerous irregular heart rhythms and death among patients.
 It's the latest admonition against the drug that Trump mentioned 17 times in various public appearances, touting its potential despite his own health advisors telling him it is unproven.
 Oklahoma spent $2 million to buy the drugs, and Utah and Ohio have spent hundreds of thousands on purchases. The rest of the cities and states received free shipments from drug companies or the U.S. government over the last month. Ohio received a large donation from a local company.
 Several states including New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas received donations of the medication from a private company based in New Jersey called Amneal Pharmaceutical. Florida was given 1 million doses from Israeli company Teva Pharmaceutical.
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Friday it has sent out 14.4 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to 14 cities, including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore, from the federal government‚Äôs national stockpile, a source that also provided South Dakota and California with supplies. The agency said earlier this month it had sent 19 million tablets and didn't explain the discrepancy between the two figures. The U.S. government received a donation of 30 million doses from Swiss drugmaker Novartis on March 29 to build up the stockpile, which does not normally stock the drug.
 ‚ÄúIf he (Trump) hadn‚Äôt amplified the early and inappropriate enthusiasm for the drug, I doubt if the states would have even been aware of it,‚Äù said Dr. Kenneth B. Klein, a consultant from outside of Seattle who has spent the last three decades working for drug companies to design and evaluate their clinical trials.
 Klein said it's understandable that government and health officials looked into hydroxychloroquine ‚Äî which is approved for treating malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus ‚Äî as a possible remedy during a frightening pandemic, but the time and energy has been misspent. The potential side effects are worrisome, especially because many coronavirus patients already have underlying health conditions, he said.
 ‚ÄúThe states and the federal government are reacting in light of that fear. But it‚Äôs not a rational response,‚Äù Klein said.
 Doctors can already prescribe the malaria drug to patients with COVID-19, a practice known as off-label prescribing, and many do. Medical and pharmacy groups have warned against prescribing it for preventive purposes. The FDA has allowed it into the national stockpile, but only for narrowly defined purposes as studies continue.
 Utah Gov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, has previously acknowledged that the drug is ‚Äúnot without controversy,‚Äù but defended the state's efforts to build up a supply. As questions mounted Friday, though, he distanced himself from an $800,000 purchase the state made from a local company and said it would be investigated.
 Herbert also halted a plan to spend $8 million more to buy 200,000 additional treatments. ‚ÄúThe bottom line is, we're not purchasing any more of this drug,‚Äù he said.
 Other states have received it from the federal government. South Dakota, with a population of 885,000 people, received 1.2 million doses and is using the drug for a trial as well as doctor-approved prescriptions for COVID-19 positive patients.
 South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican and Trump ally, said earlier this month she pushed the White House to provide enough hydroxychloroquine to give it to every hospitalized person, others who are vulnerable to the coronavirus and ‚Äúfront line‚Äù health care workers. As of Tuesday, Sanford Health said there were 200 patients who have recovered from COVID-19 in a registry, and that some of them may have taken hydroxychloroquine, but it was not a requirement.
