I forgot about the birds. But they came back – this time, during the day. Their cries were shorter and not as haunting as it was at night-time. This is probably explained by the fact that unlike the night cries, there was now no monopolisation of my attention, as the world was awake and kicking. And, of course, my half-dreaming mind of the midnight hour was not the same object as lay inside my skull at a time when traffic noises and the cacophony of construction machinery were making me loathe city life.

The teacher does not only assist in the impartation of knowledge but contributes significantly to the total development of the child. It is therefore necessary and important to recruit teachers who have not only excellent academic records but attitudes as well. The teacher unlike many other professionals is directly responsible for the quality of the human resource that we churn out in terms of productivity and attitude. A negative and unprofessional teacher is a toxin that will poison the next generation.

While some teacher unions have called for the protection of teachers and invigilators following the incidence, they (the unions) were generally quiet about the misconduct of some professional teachers who should have known better but threw professionalism and caution to the dogs to encourage, support and embolden students to engage in examination malpractices and hooliganism. It is incumbent on the teacher unions not only to protect the interest of their members but to bring them to order where they deviate significantly from the basic regulations of their profession.

Anyway, when I heard the birds sing late one night recently in Accra, I shivered. I thought that such birds only thrived in the green forest? What were they doing on the coast? Then I rememberted -- many birds do migrate to places where they are not expected to be. Hadn't I heard, in England, birdfs like the thrush and the nightingale whose melodious tones immediatel;y took me back to the Abuakwas forest birds, especially, opori3 and kctcpcri3?

Most of the southern African population (the sub-species falco peregrinus minor) is resident and sedentary. However the migrant falco peregrinus calidus may also be present in the region in the period from October-March, and can often be found in more open habitats than its resident counterpart. West African falcons are hardly mentioned by the ornithologists I have consulted so far.

I have followed this story keenly with the view to understanding the causes of these events in our senior high schools.

Teaching and teacher education the world over are one of the most critical areas that is given attention because of the role of teachers in the upbringing of children who are the next generation. In many parts of the world, successful teacher training and education is placed strategically at the centre of their economic development. While this might not be the situation in Ghana, successive governments have tried their best to make teacher training and education a priority at least. The cyclical promises of improved teacher education and emoluments by politicians learns credence to this.

I later read that Peregrine falcons can be found “in every continent of the world, excluding Antarctica”! That means “my birds” could be falcons! Indeed, “some sub-species are resident”, while others “are migratory.” That opened up every possibility very wide indeed.

The falcon strikes its prey with its talons at this speed, killing it instantly. If it misses, it may give pursuit for over two kilometres before giving up. It sometimes flies close to the cliff face to flush out birds and then chase them, and it may even rob the nests of cliff-nesting birds. On the whole, about a quarter of its hunts are successful.

On fact, according to ornithologists, "most of the sub-Saharan Africa population of falcon is resident." In Ghana, I suspect they might belong to the large group of birds of prey which we call akorcma or csansa. In southern Africa, falcons are generally localised in Namibia, northern and eastern Botswana, Zimbabwe, western Mozambique and South Africa. They generally favour riverine, mountainous or coastal environments, especially with high cliffs that are used for roosting and hunting. Dam walls, quarries and the tall buildings of city centres can also fulfil this purpose.

I have witnessed this unprofessional conduct of teachers first hand years back when some recalcitrant teachers hid behind examination halls and fed students with answers by dropping the scripts in nearby urinals for students to pick up. This incidence was however well handled and the teachers in question were punished. It was my believe then that the incidence was sporadic and will die its natural death. It is thus surprising to hear reports that in many parts of the country, it has become normal for professional teachers to aid students in their examinations. In fact, the Ghana education Service’s press release dated 7th August, 2020 which spelled out the decision and sanctions meted out to the rioting students actually stated that three teachers have been interdicted for their roles in the aforementioned disturbances across the country.

Indeed, whenever the abonsam noma made noise at night, the elders became very nervous the next morning. They fully expected to hear reports that someone had died during the night. Even if it was only onve in a thousand days that the singinmg of the birds and a death coincided, you would find it extremely difficult to convince our elders that the two events were not connected.

 Following the disturbances that characterised the ongoing 2020 West African Secondary School Certificate Examinations (WASSCE), many well-meaning Ghanaians blamed and chastised politicians, the media, parents and even the government for the unfortunate misbehaviour of many students across the country. It is indeed a seeming breakdown of the moral fibre of our society for young students to vandalise properties, engage in contumacious behaviour and attempt to use unprintable words on the first gentleman of Ghana simply for their inability to answer examination questions.

I do wish the books about birds made it easy to identify them. Most of those I have consulted only have Latin (scientific) names, or English names for the birds. As I have written before, this infuriates me! When am I going to read the work of a zoologist or ornithologist who is curious enough to write about, say, the reason why the apatupr3, for instance, is so named by the Akans?

Since these birds usually came to sing their dirge in the errie hours of the night, people who believed that witchcraft and its associated metaphysical feats usually occur during the night, naturally called them abonsam noma. Who can blame them?

When we were kids, we made up our own rationalisations of such bird names. We came up with the idea that the apatupr3 lives so close to the homes of humans (it nests on neem trees and other domestic foliage) that it has learnt that we love to catch and eat it. So when it sees a human being near it, it pretends to be injured and lies down feigning the imminent seizure of its body by rigor mortis! (It also obviously knows that we don't eat birds that we find are already dead!). This play-acting of the apatupr3 distracts the attention of the would-be human killer and the hunter gives up any hope of taking the bird. That half a second of distraction is all that the bird needs to fly vertically away and leave its hunter confounded!

I associate falcons, of course, with the Middle East (where they are widely used for sport.) But the rendition of their cries that I saw on Youtube warned me not to dismiss the possibility that they could perhaps be migratory Peregrine falcons.
