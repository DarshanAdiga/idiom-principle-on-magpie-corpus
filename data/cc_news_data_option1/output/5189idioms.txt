CHENNAI: A few hours after the successful launch of India's 42nd communications satellite CMS-01 by PSLV-C50, the Indian Space Research Organization released a video on Thursday evening with clips captured by cameras on board the rocket.   The sharply edited 2.4 minute video begins with the countdown and liftoff from the second launch pad at the Sriharikota spaceport.   After the first stage, captured by cameras near the launch pad and elsewhere on the ground, the video shows clips of the heat shield separation and finally the satellite separating from the rocket's fourth stage.   The video is accompanied by audio announcements made by Isro scientists at the Sriharikota Mission Control Center regarding the successful completion of the various stages of the mission.

Days are rarely dull for musically minded Pat McGee, even amid a pandemic- induced isolation.
 The quasi-retired lawyer and former public official spends an hour each day plucking the harp, an hour toying with an array of other instruments and another ripping the fiddle — his latest obsession since he entered isolation earlier in the year.
 “If I get three hours of music in a day, I’m really happy … It’s for my soul, keep in mind. Then I’m also tossing in another half hour to an hour of meditation,” he said over the phone.
 He’s fully embraced playing Scottish music on his fiddle, which he says is tough to master. Especially compared to the more forgiving harp, a McGee mainstay, which permits subtle mistakes that don’t draw much attention. The challenge makes learning its intricacies all the more rewarding.
 “The fiddle is one of the most fun instruments I’ve ever played in my life, ok. As you play, it’s kind of great to dance along with because your arm is moving, your fingers are moving, your whole body should move with it,” he said.
 McGee, a former Athens City Council member and area attorney (who sometimes still takes up cases at the request of the court), has begun trying to downsize. And he’s hatched up a scheme to get somebody to take off his hands a valuable possession — his bagpipe set. He hopes to find a young person with plans to remain in the Athens area who can take his place at the mantle as the city’s resident piper, an asset to any community, McGee said.
 “There’s something about the pipes that — especially for funerals and weddings — it’s just perfect, absolutely perfect. It can bring out just amazing joy and kind of catharsis for the event,” he said.
 But to be awarded the $3,000 instrument, this person must prove to McGee they’re worthy. They would need to show they’re committed to the piping craft in the long term. He said he would help them get started with the instrument using an online program, the Piper’s Dojo, then once they’re able to perform a song or two he’ll consider passing the pipes off to them in hopes that they’ll maybe even start a bagpipe band, something McGee was never able to accomplish.
 “It’s an unforgiving instrument. It takes a lot of effort to learn the bagpipes,” he said.
 Those interested in taking McGee up on the offer can send an inquiry letter to his Athens P.O. Box 110.
 More than a year removed from his City Council tenure, McGee said he doesn’t miss being in public affairs as he always felt like the odd man out in body deliberations — the one dissenting opinion, the sole vote in opposition to the rest of Council.
 “I think there was always a deal of frustration there,” said McGee, who was the last remaining Independent within the body. Each member of Council and the mayor are all Democrats, leaving little room for division.
 Though he’s no longer on Council, McGee remains civically minded. The former councilmember is particularly troubled by the university’s “inexcusable” decision to terminate hundreds of jobs which devastated many families in the area. Friends of his were tossed to the wayside by the institution, forcing some to get creative with employment opportunities.
 “I’ve always said that if OU and Athens are a partnership, which is what they keep promulgating, then a partner doesn’t walk out on the other partner when they have need of them,” he said.
 However, he oft misses practicing law. He retired from Ohio University’s Center for Student Legal Services in June 2019 after years of helping students buck underage drinking charges and resolve landlord-tenant disputes, all of which helped earn him the title of “Set ‘em Free McGee” among the university community.
 Although the court still calls McGee on occasion to take the helm on a case (he even won a jury trial recently), no longer having as much work on his plate allows the eccentric to fully indulge in hobbies.
 In his quasi-retirement, McGee sleeps until 9 a.m. after four decades of waking at the crack of dawn. And he lays awake at night later than he used to, lately reading sci-fi novels or the occasional book on human mortality.
 While McGee’s never bored, he longs for human companionship amid the pandemic. He spends much of his time indoors for fear of contracting the virus, but still makes time to venture out to the cemetery some evenings where he plays his harp as the sun dips below the horizon.
 “I do miss just getting out and walking the streets of Athens and seeing people — especially young people,” he said.
 His two cats and instruments help keep him company while he awaits a return to normalcy.

Sam Allardyce has been tasked with performing another rescue act after being appointed manager of a West Brom side who are floundering in the bottom three of the Premier League table. Having won just once in 13 matches this season following promotion from the Championship, the Baggies have dispensed with Slaven Bilic and turned to Allardyce, who has famously never been relegated in the top flight.Here, the PA news agency takes a look at Allardyce and some of his old clubs with a particular focus on their run of results before he arrived and their fortunes immediately afterwards.Making waves at Bolton Allardyce first came to national attention at Bolton by rejuvenating players supposedly past their sell-by date, including Ivan Campo, Fernando Hierro and Youri Djorkaeff, and getting the best out of Jay-Jay Okocha. Described as one of the pioneers of using sports science in football, Allardyce defied the doom-mongers and established Wanderers in the Premier League while they even competed in Europe on a couple of occasions. Even back then, his style of football was more pragmatic than aesthetic, although he has said that perceptions that he is simply a long-ball merchant are &ldquo;totally and utterly wrong&rdquo;.Newcastle get a lift after Allardyce appointment He left Bolton in April 2007 to take up a post with Newcastle the next month. The Magpies had ended the season with just one win in their previous 10 matches but they made a confident start to the 2007/08 campaign with five victories, two draws and three defeats. Having been given an outlay of £26million at the start of his reign, it came as a surprise when Newcastle parted company with Allardyce in January 2008 when they sat 11th in the standings. The Magpies went on to finish 12th and were relegated from the Premier League the following season.Blackburn benefit from &lsquo;Big Sam&rsquo; touch Blackburn were languishing in 19th in December 2008, with just three points from their last 10 games, when Allardyce took charge. They experienced an immediate upturn in fortunes with three wins and five draws in their next 10 matches. Allardyce steered Rovers away from danger and they finished 15th, improving to 10th the season afterwards. They sat 13th, five points above the drop zone, when he was peculiarly sacked by the club&rsquo;s owners days before his two-year anniversary at the club. Under Steve Kean they were relegated the following season.West Ham and Sunderland see improvement under Allardyce As has been the case at every club he has managed since taking over at Bolton, Allardyce&rsquo;s arrival at both West Ham and Sunderland saw improved results. Having been relegated from the Premier League in 2010-11, the Hammers collected 18 points in their first 10 matches en route to immediate promotion from the Championship. Finishes of 10th, 13th and 12th followed but Allardyce&rsquo;s style of play won few admirers among West Ham fans and he left at the end of the 2014-15 season. He was out of the game for a matter of months before Sunderland came calling. The Black Cats had been winless after eight games in 2015-16 but they prevailed in three of their next 10 fixtures. Sitting second bottom of the table when he joined, they finished one place and two points above the relegation zone, preserving Allardyce&rsquo;s proud record of keeping sides up.Palace and Everton get the Allardyce treatmentAfter an ill-fated stint at England, Allardyce&rsquo;s next job in the Premier League came at Crystal Palace in December 2016. By this stage, everyone was well aware of Allardyce&rsquo;s credentials so it was little surprise the Eagles – with just one win and a draw in their previous 10 matches – had three victories over their next 10 matches, rising from 17th to finish 14th. The following season, Everton rose from 13th at the time of Allardyce&rsquo;s appointment to eighth but it was not enough to save him from the axe just six months after taking the reins.Can West Brom count on Allardyce to keep them safe?Having won just once in their last 10 games, the midlands club would seem to be in Allardyce&rsquo;s wheelhouse. Across his managerial career, the points difference in the 10 games before his arrival and afterwards is +7.8. Newcastle, Blackburn and West Ham were 10, 11 and 13 points respectively better off after Allardyce first assumed command, while his record of avoiding the drop in this day and age is truly remarkable. However, the sport continues to evolve and having been out of the game for two-and-a-half years, it will be interesting to see whether his methods are still applicable.

“I am fortunate to have married a man with not just a terrific mom, but a terrific stepmom as well. For Christmas 2016, I decided to make a quilt for each that I would be able to give them in person, since we were planning to spend the holidays in my husband's hometown. My stepmother-in-law loves bright, gorgeous colors, so for her quilt I put the emphasis on the fabric rather than intricate piecing and made her a large, strip-pieced throw using a jelly roll of Kate Spain batiks. I finished piecing it three weeks before Christmas, then turned my attention to the quilt for my mother-in-law, which I finished piecing four days before we were to leave town. It was time for some tough decisions. Since most quilting motifs would get lost in the bright batiks of my stepmother-in-law's quilt, I finished hers with simple chevron quilting.

The Premier League said Thursday that it had agreed to permit permanent concussion substitutes from next month after football's lawmakers authorised extensive trials using them.
 However in a meeting on Thursday club bosses in England's top flight voted for a third time against increasing the number of allowed substitutes from three to five despite the International Football Association Board (IFAB) also extending that rule on Wednesday.
 IFAB said the trials using concussion substitutes could begin in January, and the Premier League bosses decided they would be looking at a maximum of two per side per match.
 "With player welfare the Premier League's priority, clubs agreed in principle to introduce additional permanent concussion substitutions following approval of the trial by the International Football Association Board yesterday," the Premier League said.
 "The Premier League will look to implement protocols which will allow a maximum of two concussion substitutes to be used per team, with the opposition side able to use the equivalent number.
 "The additional concussion substitutions may be made regardless of the number of substitutions a team has made already."
 Concussion has become an increasingly hot issue in the sport -- rugby union has used head injury replacements for a while -- with increasing concern over the amount of former footballers who develop dementia later in life.
 Although Premier League clubs once again repudiated moves to allow five substitutes they did agree to allow nine players on the bench as opposed to the present seven.
 The measure will come into effect from this weekend's round of games beginning on Saturday.
 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp had been especially vociferous in his wanting five substitutes due to a lengthening injury list and concerns over the hectic fixture schedule.
 Others such as Sheffield United's Chris Wilder argued against it believing that it would only favour those teams with big squads.

17 dicembre 2020 - Nei mercati di Campagna Amica è già scattata l’operazione festività a kmzero. Con i pacchi natalizi personalizzati, preparati dai produttori in ogni provincia i consumatori potranno rivolgersi direttamente al banco preferito per lo shopping “Made in Veneto”. Gli acquisti di prodotti tipici – spiega Coldiretti – daranno ossigeno all’agroalimentare regionale che l’anno scorso nello stesso periodo contava in una spesa di 460 milioni di euro per i regali da mettere sotto l’albero”. Tra i doni preferiti c’è proprio l’enogastronomia anche per l’affermarsi di uno stile di vita attento alla riscoperta della tradizione a tavola, che si esprime con la preparazione fai da te di ricette personali per serate in casa nel rispetto dei limiti imposti dal Covid. In questo senso – commenta Coldiretti Veneto – l’invito dell’Assessore Federico Caner rivolto a tutti i cittadini non può che essere un incoraggiamento ulteriore alle scelte legate ad un’alimentazione sana e sicura che segue i principi della stagionalità e premia il lavoro di oltre 60 mila imprese agricole venete. Va nella stessa direzione l’impegno assunto dalla Regione del Veneto di rivedere la normativa di orientamento per favorire il consumo di cibo locale nelle mense collettive predisponendo appalti pubblici che premiano la filiera corta dal produttore al consumatore contribuendo anche a sviluppare un’educazione alimentare alle nuove generazioni basata sulla distintività della produzione regionale. Per sostenere il rilancio dell’agriturismo, uno dei settori più provato dalla crisi, Coldiretti con Terranostra promuove i “buoni esperienza” per una vacanza o per un pranzo da omaggiare ad amici e famigliari per uscire e cercare evasione in luoghi sicuri e isolati dove spesso si trovano le aziende che danno accoglienza e ristorazione. Anche questa è una formula che incontra il favore di genitori che omaggiano figli oppure nonni che vogliono ricordare i nipoti. L’idea vale anche con menù a domicilio. Le proposte degli agricoltori di Coldiretti Veneto portano il loro nome, insieme al rapporto fidelizzato con il cliente che nonostante l’emergenza sanitaria ha potuto sempre contare sulla presenza in piazza degli operatori agricoli ma anche nelle consegne a domicilio di tipicità enogastronomiche. I doni agroalimentari esprimono anche per l’affermarsi di uno stile di vita attento alla riscoperta della tradizione a tavola, con la preparazione fai da te di ricette personali per serate speciali in casa. Contenuti in sacchetti di juta, cesti intrecciati a mano, sporte naturali il meglio delle specialità regionali è accessibile per tutte le tasche e, in molti casi, permette anche di sostenere i bisognosi ai quali, gli agricoltori, hanno sempre rivolto la loro attenzione organizzando iniziative benefiche su tutto il territorio. Il disagio sociale è aumentato con un incremento del 30% di nuovi poveri – dice Coldiretti Veneto - c’è chi ha perso il lavoro, piccoli commercianti o artigiani che hanno dovuto chiudere, le persone impiegate nel sommerso che non godono di particolari sussidi o aiuti pubblici e non hanno risparmi accantonati, come pure molti lavoratori a tempo determinato o con attività saltuarie che si sono fermate. Persone e famiglie che mai prima d’ora – conclude Coldiretti Veneto - hanno sperimentato condizioni di vita così problematiche tanto da dover ricorrere alle forme di solidarietà. Un occhio di riguardo sarà loro dedicato sempre dalla task force degli agricoltori di Coldiretti Veneto con iniziative costanti fino all’inizio del nuovo anno.

100 and 200 hour MA are convergedThe EURJPY has been mired in a range of about 100 pips (104 actually) since breaking higher on December 1. That is a narrow trading range. The "market" is saying "I don't know what is next, but am waiting for the next shove". Non-trending transitions to trending. The market is non-trending. So while the market chops up and down, there is hope in anticipating a break and run at some point (i.e. that next shove). Looking at the hourly chart, the 100 and 200 hour MA cuts across the middle of the high and low range. That is expected as the market non-trends. Those MAs have seen a lot of moves above and below of late which is also expected. Traders waffle back and forth. Having said that, the MAs can act as bias defining clues for the bulls and bears. Move above and stay above is more bullish. Move below and stay below is more bearish. The next targets become the swing highs to the upside (between 126.648 and 127.739) and the swing lows to the downside (between 125.70-125.782).Break the extremes, and look for a run. What does the consolidation in December look like on the daily chart?Looking at the daily chart below, the sideways action is near the highs for the year. Back in August, the high price came in at 1.26745. That is just above the December high price at 1.26734. The high price for the year spiked up to 1.27068 back on September 1. A move higher and above the 126.74 level would need to get above the high for the year and then it would be open road.On the downside, swing highs going back to October and November stalled near 125.125. So get below 125.70 and traders will target 125.125 and then the rising 100 day moving average at 124.510.Non-trend transitions to trend. It is a time to anticipate for a break and run at some point.

According to CNN reporting, the former police officer, Mark Anthony Aguirre, was allegedly working for a pro-Trump group called the "Liberty Center for God and Country," which, prosecutors said, had paid him more than $260,000 to investigate alleged ballot schemes in the Houston area. He thought the repairman was the mastermind of a grand election fraud operation and was carrying 750,000 fraudulent ballots, the Harris County district attorney said in a statement. He was just a repairman, said police.
 Aguirre was arrested Tuesday and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. He posted $30,000 bond that afternoon and is out of jail, according to Harris County court records. His attorney maintains he's the target of a "political prosecution."
 Aguirre found no fake ballots. In fact, no one has found much of an election conspiracy other than one led by President Donald Trump to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election, despite scores of lawsuits and a vicious intimidation campaign against election officials.
 It may seem reassuring that President-elect Joe Biden will soon assume the presidency, and that the empty accusations of fraud are getting laughed out of court, found to have zero evidence behind them. But when conspiracy theories take root, they have a tendency to continue growing.
 The United States, especially since President Donald Trump entered the political fray, has become fertile soil for conspiracies. Aguirre didn't kill anyone that day, but that hardly means conspiracy theories are victimless crimes.
 Countless Republican election officials have come under withering attack from Trump and his acolytes; some have received death threats. But the danger from Trump's unfathomably irresponsible attack on US democracy, and his false claim that he won, will not end when Biden takes the oath on January 20.
 Most Republican Trump voters still believe the lie. A Reuters poll found 52% of Republicans said Trump won, compared with just 29% who said Biden did. (The poll showed 73% of all those polled agreed Biden won.)
 And history is replete with examples of just how destructive grand lies can become, regardless of whether they have any basis in fact. The theories may anger believers, but they also help interpret reality in a way that is somehow soothing, more consistent with their wishes and ideologies, often with calamitous results.

Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday hoped that the UK would accept Indias early harvest proposition within the framework of a larger free trade agreement, which both the countries are working towards. Under an early harvest arrangement, two trading partners significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on a limited number of goods with a view to promoting trade. In a free trade agreement FTA, the partners do the same for maximum number of goods, besides relaxing norms to boost trade in services and investments. I hope that the early harvest proposition of India, within the framework of a larger FTA, which we are working towards, will be accepted by the UK, he said at CIIs Partnership Summit. Goyal said the early harvest proposition will help both the countries grab the low-hanging fruits. We are looking at possibilities of trade in goods and services and investments being a part of our enhanced trade partnership. We are looking at an option to see if it can be converted into an early harvest agreement, he added. Asked whether there is any deadline to conclude the FTA talks, the minister said these negotiations are complex in nature and the country has to see its impacts over several years going forward. ...considering our past experiences, we have to really look at every FTA very carefully, he said. The minister, however, added that both the sides are looking at fast-tracking the mechanism. I would be very pleased if we can come up with an early harvest kind of an agreement within next year...My own sense is that FTA cannot be done faster than probably a couple of years if not three, because that has too many dimensions, he added. Speaking at the event, UK Secretary of State for International Trade Elizabeth Truss said both the sides are working on an advanced trade partnership as part of a roadmap that will lead to a future FTA. On the subject of the FTA, we have made progress, but there is more to be done. We need to make sure that we identify how we can make it easier and more efficient to do business, she added.

In the Middle Ages, before medicine understood viruses and bacteria, whenever the plague -- the black death -- devastated communities, the claim that Jews were responsible routinely resulted in their massacre. Jews were a favorite target of conspiracy theorists across the centuries.
 Potentially more relevant to our situation is a conspiracy theory that arose a hundred years ago. After Germany lost World War I, far-right antisemitic groups started a rumor that German Jews had plotted to betray their country and it was because of them that Germany suffered a humiliating loss. German Jews had fought and died alongside the rest of their countrymen in the war, but facts, as we can all see now, can prove irrelevant to those who listen to the siren song of conspiracies telling them what they want to hear.
 Among those listening to the WWI "stab in the back" myth was Cpl. Adolf Hitler, who used the fabrication to help fuel his political rise on the strength of the need to extract vengeance. We know how that ended.
 Allowing the myths to take root is extraordinarily dangerous. That's why I have criticized Biden for his reluctance to more forcefully refute Trump's poisonous claim that he will be an illegitimate president. Biden made a start this week, but he should face this threat with the urgency it deserves.
 Social media has turbocharged mythology mills, and the spreaders of political lies have found it easy to slither their tentacles throughout society. When Trump became President, they benefited from the world's most powerful megaphone.
 Even before he took office, the "Pizzagate" fabrication, a preposterous claim that Hillary Clinton and her allies were operating a child sex-trafficking ring with a Washington pizzeria as a front, led a man to drive hours to the location and fire an assault rifle in an effort to free the children. There were no children.
 Pizzagate has exploded into the madness of QAnon, still obsessed with pedophilia, with the Clintons, and filled with thinly veiled antisemitic ideas.
 QAnon, all but endorsed by Trump, will have a presence in the next Congress, with one candidate who has promoted the theory, Marjorie Taylor Greene, elected to the House. (Another incoming Rep., Lauren Boebert, has engaged with the QAnon theory but later distanced herself, saying she was not a follower of the movement.)
 Whether or not GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who campaigned with Greene -- and faces a runoff vote for her seat next month -- will remain in the Senate, remains to be seen.
 We don't know just how destructive the full impact of Trump's election lies will be on a number of fronts, from undermining Biden's ability to govern to corroding the fabric of American democracy.
 History dictates we should be on our guard, and it also reminds us that, when looking to the guilty, we should glance beyond the likes of a former Houston policeman, and hold responsible political figures who promote the lies by repeating them or failing to deny them.

Not only is the amount of work ridiculous, but the online lessons students are required to complete are a fail. Learning online is exponentially more difficult than learning in the classroom because it is impossible to ask questions and receive an answer in a reasonable amount of time or get additional help on topics students may not understand. Everyone I've talked to about this new schedule, students and teachers alike, say that the new schedule is harder. Online classes are more difficult for teachers to manage and learning at home is causing students to struggle.
 I suggest that Alpine School District should reevaluate their decision to continue the remote learning on Wednesdays. Based on the surveying I've done with local teachers and students, they all seem to agree that going to school, face to face, five times a week would greatly improve workload, grades and motivation. Teachers would be less stressed about losing class time and have more time to work with their students in class so students do not have as many issues. Students would be less stressed, learn more effectively, and have time to focus on work, sports or other extracurricular activities. And because there is little to no evidence of COVID-19 spreading as long as proper precautions are taken, going to school, in person five days a week, would be safe for the community and students.

In one extreme case, a Beijing teacher accused of crimes on a big-character poster was beaten to death by her own students.

And once I got around the difference between plans/ideas and tasks, to-do creation was as simple and intuitive as it could get. The process can also be super fast thanks to the launcher shortcuts for quick task and plan/idea creation. The projects in the planning board are great for keeping an overview of what else I've got on the back burner and lets me separate personal things from work stuff. You can even assign different priority levels and tags to tasks, though I haven't found the need to do that just yet. The theming options also look like they could be fun to play with, but extensive theming isn't my cup of tea -- I'm happy with the standard UI and the gorgeous light mode widget.
