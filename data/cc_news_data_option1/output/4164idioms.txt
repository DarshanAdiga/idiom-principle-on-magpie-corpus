Campaigning door-to-door is next to impossible this season because of COVID, so political signs are a key way to show our support. Mine aren’t the only ones swiped. There are reports from across the state of Biden and Black Lives Matter signs being pilfered, allegedly by Trump supporters who think anything goes in this election. Stealing them is not only vile, it’s a crime. Taking or defacing a single sign carries a fine of $250. And it’s a waste of time for law enforcement to investigate the incidents.

Bloomberg) -- First, Hyundai Motor Co. made headlines about its electric cars catching fire. Five days later, it was General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. The next day, it was BMW AG.
 Vehicles going up in flames aren’t new to the electric era. An estimated 171,500 took place annually in the U.S. alone over a recent three-year period, and cars powered by the combustion of gasoline are plenty prone to catching fire. But the issues affecting some of the world’s largest automakers over the past week are both a reflection of plug-in models taking off in the market and a threat to more widespread adoption.
 The vehicle blazes are making a big impact before automakers have even managed to pin down their precise causes. A flaw affecting a plug-in hybrid SUV in Europe will keep Ford from complying with tougher emissions standards this year. BMW and Hyundai are recalling tens of thousands of cars, and GM is being probed by U.S. safety regulators.
 “What we’re seeing with new fires has more to do with the landslide of new EV models and higher sales in the last couple of years -- there are more fires because there are more EVs,” said Sam Jaffe, managing director at Cairn Energy Research Advisors, a Boulder, Colorado-based consultancy. “Automakers are safety engineers first, performance engineers second, so I expect every automaker will react to any fire with tremendous care.”
 While EVs don’t invoke the same instinctual distrust as self-driving cars or flying taxis might, they do require a leap of faith for some consumers. A younger, tech-savvier population is one reason why China is the world’s biggest EV market, Jato Dynamics analysts said in a report earlier this week, with consumers in Europe and the U.S. more likely to stick with what they know.
 Chemical Cocktail
 Around the world, engineers are still tinkering with the complicated chemical cocktail that goes into EV batteries. They’re in a global race to make them cheaper, lighter, and more powerful -- one that some analysts warn could come at the expense of safety.
 “Pursuing a higher battery density will normally mean you need to sacrifice safety,” said Toliver Ma, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Guotai Junan Securities Co. “It’s long been a problem that hasn’t been solved. Battery makers are wanting to put out batteries that have a long driving range, because that’s what automakers demand.”
 Hyundai’s problem that started off automakers’ recent spate of EV woes involves its Kona model. The Korean carmaker is calling back more than 25,000 of the compact sport-utility vehicles because short circuits caused by a battery cell manufacturing defect could cause fires after they charge. Its supplier, LG Chem Ltd., said the exact cause of the fires haven’t been determined.
 Four days after South Korea’s land and transportation ministry announced the safety campaign, Hyundai said it was reviewing whether the issue warrants a global recall.
 The next shoe to drop was the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s announcement it’s investigating whether GM’s Chevrolet Bolt EV is prone to catching fire when parked. GM said it’s cooperating with the inquiry and conducting its own probe.
 Ford’s malady involving its Kuga SUV for now appears to be the most most consequential of the bunch. The automaker is delaying the U.S. launch of the mechanically similar Escape plug-in hybrid to next year over the risk of recharging fires.
 China Fires
 The plug-in hybrid version of the Kuga was pivotal to Ford complying with the European Union’s tougher limits on carbon-dioxide emissions this year. The automaker said it will fall short of complying with the standards and try to pool its fleet with another manufacturer to avoid paying a fine.
 BMW still expects to hit its CO2 targets this year despite a stop-sale of several plug-in hybrid models in Europe and the U.S. -- the X1, X2, X3 and X5 SUVs; the 2, 3, 5 and 7 Series cars; and its Mini brand’s Countryman model. It’s recalling roughly 27,000 vehicles worldwide over risks their batteries can overheat and catch fire.
 The recent spate of fires follow another round last year in greater China. NIO Inc. said in April 2019 that one of its ES8 vehicles caught fire in the northwestern city of Xi’an while being repaired, while a video on Chinese social media platforms showed a Tesla bursting into flames in a Shanghai garage.
 The heightened sensitivity around battery safety could impact efforts among producers to boost performance, as well as driving range between recharging, by using more nickel in place of cobalt, according to Alice Yu, a Beijing- based analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
 The nickel heavy so-called NCM 811 battery cathode configuration is one of the most popular, adopted first by Panasonic Corp. and now mass-produced by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., a supplier to Tesla Inc. It’s 80% nickel, 10% cobalt and 10% manganese, and has a longer lifespan, allowing cars to travel further on a single charge.
 “Manufacturers are trying to increase energy density, so having more nickel and less cobalt, that increases the risk of having less thermal stability,” Yu said. “Having these incidences will hold back the manufacturers’ moves to improve energy density, and make them more cautious.”

Things that are stolen out of vehicles may not have serial numbers,” said Mahlum. “They’re difficult to follow up on because we oftentimes have no suspect information, and not a lot of evidence is left behind.
 Newman didn't have anything of value stolen, but says she still wanted to raise awareness of situations like her own. "Social media right now is huge. That's one of the biggest outlets of finding out who else is a victim,” she said.
 In the process, her post received over 100 comments, with others sharing their stories, lending words of support and even offering to fix up her window free of charge.
 "That just shows humanity, that shows that people do care. There are still good people in this world,” said Newman.

 U.S. stock indexes erased much of their early losses and closed modestly lower Thursday, extending the S&P 500's losing streak to a third day.
 Wall Street has turned cautious this week amid a confluence of worrisome trends for the economy, which is still hampered by the pandemic. Coronavirus infections are rising in Europe, prompting governments in France and Britain to impose new measures to contain the outbreak. Caseloads area also climbing in the Americas and parts of Asia.
 In the U.S., investor optimism that the Trump administration and Congress will soon reach a deal on another round of stimulus for the economy has waned.
 Meanwhile, campaign theatrics continue, with the latest question whether the debate scheduled next week between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joseph Biden will go ahead as planned. The clash planned for this week was called off after Trump's bout of coronavirus. Biden has said he plans to participate in next week’s debate but that he would ask Trump to take a COVID-19 test before arriving.

PEMBROKE -- Incumbent Josh Cutler will face off against Republican candidate Tatyana Semyrog for state representative of the 6th Plymouth District in the Nov. 3 general election.
 The 6th Plymouth District includes the towns of Pembroke, Duxbury and Hanson.
 Cutler, a 49-year-old Democrat, has held the seat for four terms. He co- sponsored the Energy Savings and Efficiency Act (Energy SAVE), and led the successful effort to restore weekend commuter rail service to the South Shore.
 "I'm running for re-election (because) I want to continue to use my experience to help solve problems and make sure that our district continues to be a great place to live, work, and raise a family," Cutler said.
 Looking toward a potential fifth term, Cutler said he is focused on renewable energy, climate change, economic development and education. He said he wants to focus on bringing local aid to his district, and previously helped pass the Student Opportunity Act, which will provide funding to school districts to address disparities in achievement.
 Cutler also said he is focused on supporting small businesses, especially in light of COVID-19.
 "We need to focus on our economic recovery and helping all businesses, but especially our small businesses that need help the most," Cutler said.
 Semyrog did not respond to email, phone or social media attempts to contact her for this story, but did participate Monday in a candidate forum hosted by radio station WATD.
 In the forum, Semyrog touched on oppression she experienced in her birth country, the former Soviet Union, and said she now sees similar behavior in the United States with the "labeling, bullying, debasing, marginalizing, and ostracizing" of people who do not agree with "the left."
 Cutler said the role of a state representative is three-fold, but most importantly it requires one to provide constituent service. He said that is especially important because of the pandemic as people navigate unemployment and financial assistance for their small businesses. The other two roles, he said, are fighting for the district's share of state resources and being a leader on issues of importance to the district as well as the state.
 "I think I have a track record I think of getting things done, of being a voice for my district, I mean I can give you a litany of examples," Cutler said. "I'm comfortable [with] people judging me on my record and I hope that they will and I think if they look at that they'll see that I've done a fair job and I work hard and I've been an effective voice for our district."
 Semyrog said that her name has been "dragged through the mud and smeared," and that she has not received an apology from Cutler for what Semyrog says are attacks on her heritage, past, and character.
 "I am running to stand up against this oppression, to give people hope and courage," Semyrog said during the WATD candidates forum. "Our freedoms are under attack by the kind of socialist agenda my opponent has been voting for. His votes to defund our police, increase our gas tax, all while voting twice to increase his pay speak of a radical leftist who has no businesses representing this district."
 In response, Cutler said that he supports policing reform, such as the licensing and certification of police officers, but does not support "defunding the police," which refers to the reallocation of funds from police departments to other priority areas. Additionally, he said that the gas tax has decreased by 40% since he took office, although he did vote in support of the March tax bill.
 Semyrog was recently criticized on social media over comments she appears to have made under her maiden name on the blog shoebat.com. The comments, which are now deleted, addressed the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting.
 She responded to the attacks with a post on her personal blog, where she said she is not able to recall much of the time period during which those comments were made due to her cancer diagnosis and death of her husband.
 "I don't recognize any of those words as ever have been written by me because I simply have no memory of such," Semyrog wrote in the blog post.
 Cutler currently resides in Pembroke with his wife and two children.
 Semyrog is a resident of Duxbury where she lives with her three children.
 Voters in Massachusetts have until Oct. 24 to register to vote in the Nov. 3 primary and until Oct. 28 to request a mail-in ballot. Early voting will take place from Oct. 17 to Oct. 30.
 Registration can be done by mail or online at sec.state.ma.us/ovr.

Moreover, it's the smooth camaraderie between Fin and Sabrina that focuses on the lighter, happier moments while Iseman plays the supportive girlfriend to a t. Carpenter herself continues to be a breath of fresh air as she plays the varying emotions of a best friend yearning for her childhood buddy to live one more day. The duo dream of making music and it takes dying for Zach to finally live out his dream in limited time-space.

Bloomberg) -- Ant Group plans to increase the valuation target for its initial public offering to at least $280 billion due to strong demand, charging ahead with the sale even as the Trump administration weighs restrictions on the Chinese fintech giant, according to people familiar with the matter.
 The Hangzhou-based company is lifting the target by at least 12% from a previous estimate of $250 billion after initial discussions with investors, the people said, requesting not to be identified because the matter is private. Ant aims to raise about $35 billion in the sale, people familiar said.
 Despite the U.S. headwinds, Jack Ma’s Ant is moving ahead with what could be the world’s largest IPO, with same-day listings in Hong Kong and Shanghai, the people said. At $280 billion, Ant would be bigger than Bank of America Corp. and three times the size of Citigroup Inc., while its sale would top Saudi Aramco’s record $29 billion raise.
 The Hong Kong stock exchange has scheduled an Ant hearing for as soon as next week, pending an approval from the Chinese securities watchdog, a requirement for companies conducting dual listings in China and Hong Kong, people familiar said. Ant and the Hong Kong bourse declined to comment in emailed statements.
 The Hong Kong hearing before a 28-member panel of external professionals has been expected for weeks but has yet to happen. If it’s delayed much further, the IPO risks straddling the Nov. 3 U.S. election where some expect a surge in postal ballots to create prolonged uncertainty. The one-week gap in Hong Kong between the pricing of an IPO and the start of trading means investors would be left exposed to an increase in volatility.
 The Trump administration is exploring restrictions on Ant, as well as rival Tencent Holdings Ltd., over concerns that their digital payment platforms threaten U.S. national security.
 Trump’s ban on Tencent’s WeChat in the U.S. is facing push back. A magistrate judge said this week she’s unlikely to allow the country to implement prohibitions on Wechat while the government appeals her earlier ruling.
 Ant said it’s making progress in getting the required approvals for its IPO in Shanghai and Hong Kong, following reports that it has yet to receive a green light from the Chinese securities watchdog.
 Ant has added Barclays Plc, ICBC International and BOC International to its list of joint book runners for the Hong Kong sale, people familiar said. That’s in addition to China International Capital Corp, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley acting as sponsors and Credit Suisse Group AG acting as joint global coordinator for the Hong Kong leg.
 Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte is planning to invest more than $1 billion in Ant’s Hong Kong and Shanghai IPO, people familiar have said. The listing is also drawing interest from other existing investors like Temasek Holdings Pte and the National Council for Social Security Fund, they said.

I am honored to register my support for Ruth Lyons’ re-election to Topsham Board of Selectmen. I have known Ruth for many years, watching her rise to numerous challenges and overcoming each challenge set in her path. She has an inherent ability to address issues with strength while exhibiting sensitivity and compassion in the process. Reflecting on her years as Topsham’s Town Clerk, Ruth always had a steady and positive approach while freely sharing a big hug and warm smile. In light of the stresses influenced by the pandemic of 2020, I believe our community governments all benefit by having Ruth and others sharing her wisdom and demeanor as leaders. I encourage Topsham’s citizens to support Ruth on Nov 3.

A music teacher ended up with a man on the bonnet of his car after a heated confrontation at a Sunshine Coast centre went awry.
 After an earlier incident, a scared Riley Benson Cope did not know what to do when he clipped a man’s car and saw him walking towards him.
 REVEALED: Powerful Coast people who have been in court
 Crash drink driver polishes off wine waiting for police
 Cope’s lawyer Martin Longhurst submitted a number of character references to the Maroochydore Magistrates Court on Friday, describing Cope as a kind and gentle man.
 “He was a scared man at the time of the offending,” he said.
 Mr Longhurst told the court Cope was a music teacher and had just finished teaching a class at the Buderim community theatre centre on September 5, last year.
 The court heard the victim was parked in a no parking zone at the centre and Cope told him he couldn’t park there.
 Cope then took photos of the car, with concerns for the safety of the children.
 “The other gentleman waited for my client at his own car – he’s a much bigger man, he stood over my client,” Mr Longhurst said.
 “He yelled at him, he physically stopped my client from getting in his car.
 “He forced my client to delete the photographs of his car and only let him go when he did.”
 The court heard Cope then got in his car and drove off.
 “He was hyper focused looking out for this other gentleman, as a result of that he clipped the car,” Mr Longhurst said.
 “This other gentleman started walking towards my client with his phone out, my client was driving very slowly and told him to get off the road.
 “My client was still travelling slowly and the other gentleman ends up on his bonnet.”
 The court heard the victim rolled off the bonnet of the car and suffered some scratches and bruising.
 Cope then called police.
 The court heard Cope was remorseful for the incident and had offered to pay compensation to the victim.
 Cope pleaded guilty in Maroochydore Magistrates Court to unlawfully and with negligence operating a motor vehicle without reasonable care, causing bodily harm.
 Police prosecutor Dave Bradley said people in charge of dangerous machines needed to be held accountable for their actions.
 “This is akin to road rage but I acknowledge it’s not road rage,” he said.
 “It takes two to tango and in this case that certainly was the circumstances.”
 Senior Sergeant Bradley said it was “dumb luck” that the victim wasn’t more seriously injured.
 “The defendant ultimately through his actions caused the victim to come off that car and he was injured,” he said.
 Magistrate Rod Madsen said it was evident that the incident was out of character for Cope.
 “You are very fortunate that nothing more happened to that man,” he said.
 “I hope this has a long-term impact and what happened here stays with you for a very long time because that’s the best way to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
 Mr Madsen fined Cope $2000 and ordered him to pay $500 in compensation to the victim.
 Cope was also ordered to pay $2261.89 restitution for the damage to the car.
 No conviction was recorded.

When high-level programs came calling after Paige’s stellar junior season, his plan was to reclassify as a junior in order to receive another year of high school eligibility as a member of the 2021-22 class. Since his father, Craig, lives in Alabama, he figured he’d look into one of the most prestigious football programs in the country.
 This led him to Hoover High School, which was notably featured on MTV’s Two-A- Days from 2006-07. The Buccaneers are currently 8-0 in 7A Region 3, ranking as Alabama’s No. 2 team overall and No. 27 in the country, respectively, according to Max Preps.
 Paige was in the Yellowhammer State prepping to get seven-on-seven action going. He wanted to show that New York football players could play ball just like the southern kids, if given the same opportunities.
 That’s when life went sideways back in March.
 “Due to COVID, everything didn’t (pan) out how it was supposed to pan out,” Paige said. “So it was either lose a senior year down there or come back and possibly play my senior year (up) here. So I just decided to come back. I didn’t want to risk it.”
 Being in a state on New York’s travel advisory list — as well as being surrounded by several states on the most updated list this week — Paige thought it was best to get out of a coronavirus hot zone. Add in difficulties with transferring to Hoover, Paige made the decision to come home, where he could train and be around family and friends for his senior year.
 Paige sees a lot of potential in this year’s Wolverines and said the team will surprise people by “coming out with a bang.” He feels that no fall football, as well as the impact it may have on college recruiting, will add some urgency this spring.
 “Switching from fall to spring messed up a lot for recruiting and scholarship opportunities and stuff,” Paige said. “So I feel like in the spring everybody’s gonna go harder and it’s gonna be more entertaining. Because everybody’s gonna be playing for that scholarship, that free college.”
 One person who’s happy to have Paige back is Niagara Falls head coach Don Bass, as he gets his top playmaker back for next season. As great of player that Paige is on the field, Bass is far more impressed with who he is as a young man.
 “Off the field, he’s just an amazing young man. He literally puts a lot of things in front of himself — friends and family,” Bass said. “He’s the kind of kid that gets to your heart really fast. You’re like, ‘Wow, you’re too young to be carrying around these types of burdens around with you.’ At this age you should be going to school, getting good grades and having fun. That’s your job, that’s it, nothing else matters.
 “But when you see them and they’re so focused on ... ‘I’ve gotta make sure my sibling have this, and my mom’s in a better position than this and my friends are this.’ ... So he’s the kind of kid that really tugs at my heartstrings when I get a chance to sit down and talk with him, so I’m very happy that he’s still here.”

LaFarris Risby set out to write her memoir as means to share, encourage and inspire others and for herself. As she penned the words of her life it helped her heal from long-held emotional wounds, some that didn’t realize were still open until the memories came flooding back.
 “I actually wrote it for me — it was more about a healing process,” she said. “But I also wanted to be able to help other people that found themselves in similar situations.”
 The book chronicles how she went from being a teen mother in an abusive relationship to a successful businesswoman. Risby owns Loving Arms Daycare Center, which she said is, with 10 employees, the largest African American owned business in Geary County.
 The reader will join her on her journey from when her mother died when she was six years old to how she found the strength to improve her own lot in life. That part of her journey started when her then-husband, who was in the Army, received orders moving the family from Germany to Fort Riley.
 “We went home because we're both from the same hometown (in Arkansas),” she said. “He was supposed to come to Fort Riley and get everything set up to move me and the kids here.”
 Her now-ex-husband had found a place but moved his pregnant girlfriend and her four children into the house, she said.
 “I got off the Greyhound bus in Junction City with $50 and no place to live,” she said.
 She was 28 years old and had been with her ex since she was 14. Finally, the lightbulb went off.
 “My mother didn’t die for me to live this way,” she said. “If I got to eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I live in a cardboard box, I'm done. I'm not going to be a victim any longer. So, I took back my life and the control of it.”
 Armed with only a high school diploma, she set out in a strange town to start building a life for her and her children.
 In the next few months, she went though a couple of jobs — nothing was working out, she couldn’t make ends meet, and wasn’t getting enough child support. Her daughter had medical issues and her son was struggling with the divorce and move.
 She had no idea what a SWOT Analysis was at the time, but later realized the day she sat down at the table and took a hard look at her Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats she had performed a personal SWOT analysis.
 “I asked myself, ‘What can I do? What am I good at?’” she said. “I took a piece of paper and I made an X in the middle of the paper, which gave me four, four squares. I wrote, likes, dislikes, what I'm good at what I'm not good at. And I found the common denominator.”
 She made a plan. With zero capital, she set out to put her plan in action.
 “I started with registered childcare because I didn't have any money,” she said. “I used what was in my hands, which was things that I had established with my children — their toys, their books, their games, and things I had learned through being a teenage mom and being a parent. I started there.”
 Next step was to become licensed, then qualify for a group home. That’s when she knew she was on her way. She went to school and earned a degree in early childhood education, a degree in human services, and about 25 certifications including Life Educator.
 Five years after she arrived in Junction City, she had her bachelor’s degree and opened her first childcare center.
 The book outlines her legacy, she said. It’s about overcoming obstacles and having the faith to believe the impossible is possible.
 “I believe in legacy, and I believe in leaving gifts for my children,” she said. “I wanted them to know, strength and perseverance. I wanted to leave something that they could hold tangible in their hands.”
 But she also believes there are many women who can relate to her situation and can recognize themselves in the book.
 “Maybe not through the abuse but she could have went through a loss — that could be a loss of death it could have been a loss of divorce,” she said. “I went through divorce and went through the five stages of the grieving process through the divorce. I feel like that every woman can find themselves somewhere in their book.”
 She released the book this past summer. It is available on Kindle for free and in paperback on Amazon for $29.99.

They say the ordinance could push affordable housing development outside of Portland and increase sprawl.

Nathan's stable growing by leaps and bounds

Rallying from behind bars in northern Thailand, Anon Numpa urged supporters Friday to keep fighting for democracy -- still defiant months after his fiery speeches fuelled a movement calling for reforms to the ultra-powerful monarchy.
 Student leaders and activists have kept up relentless protests, demanding the government step down.
 But this week tensions ratcheted sharply as activists dared to surround a royal motorcade carrying the queen.
 The government issued an emergency decree in response, banning gatherings of more than four people and arresting around two dozen of the most prominent protesters, including human rights lawyer Anon.
 He wrote on Facebook he had been forcibly taken by helicopter to Chiang Mai, where his lawyer confirmed he had been refused bail.
 In a handwritten message posted online, Anon urged his supporters to "keep on fighting".
 "My freedom is a very small issue compared to the entire struggle for democracy," he wrote.
 "Adhere to the ideology of non-violence and do not be afraid of any obstacles."
 Anon has spent his career defending those charged under Thailand's draconian royal defamation laws, which can see people jailed for up to 15 years per charge.
 But in August the 36-year-old stepped into the limelight by calling for frank discussions on the monarchy at a rally in Bangkok.
 His speech sent a lightning bolt through Thailand's royalist establishment, smashing a long-held taboo.
 "I had to come out and be on the frontlines," Anon told AFP in an interview last month, knowing the decision would make him a prime target.
 "It is not right for me -- an activist and a lawyer who deals with human rights and is watched by the media -- to hide behind the people on the ground."
 \- King and country -
 Anon was born in 1984 in northeastern Roi Et province, where Bangkok's military-aligned establishment is widely hated.
 His disenchantment with the monarchy grew as he started defending those charged under the draconian lese majeste law, known as "112".
 The law shields the royal family from defamation and can be broadly interpreted to target criticism as well.
 "Handling the 112 cases made me realise what the royal institution's role was... and how it is tied to Thai politics," Anon told AFP.
 Critics also accuse authorities of deploying the law against anti-military activists, stamping out dissent under the guise of defending the royals.
 Today's youth-led movement is demanding the resignation of Premier Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the former military chief who led the 2014 coup and held on to power after last year's disputed elections.
 Prayut has warned Thailand would be "engulfed in flames" if the students push too hard on demands for royal reform.
 Anon acknowledged the fight for "structural" change will not be easy.
 "The people who surround the royal institution are still trying to hold on to the old power."
 Under Thailand's system of a constitutional monarchy, King Maha Vajiralongkorn is supposed to stay out of politics.
 But his influence permeates every aspect of society, buttressed by the arch- royalist military and kingdom's billionaire clans.
 The ultra-wealthy monarch has made unprecedented changes since ascending the throne in 2016, taking personal control of the palace's fortune -- worth an estimated $60 billion -- and moving two army units under his direct command.
 \- 'The fight will continue' -
 Protesters are calling for the abolition of the royal defamation law, greater accounting of the palace's finances and the monarch's withdrawal from politics.
 "If the monarchy is not reformed, this country cannot go on," Anon shouted to cheering crowds at a rally late Wednesday, just hours before his latest detention.
 His previous arrests -- for which he was granted bail -- failed to silence the lawyer, earning him rock-star status in the movement.
 With Thailand's history of coups and state-sanctioned bloodshed, the fear of a violent crackdown looms.
 But the lawyer told AFP the gains made in the past months are worth it.
 "What we have done will not be in vain," he said.
 "We can use our wins as a way for the next generation to fight on."

 # Our view: Sharing roads courteously, obeying traffic laws everyone's responsibility
 AJ Media Editorial Board
 The state’s highways, roads and streets are once again bustling with activity, which makes this as good a time as any to remind everyone out there on the roads to exercise an abundance of caution and courtesy.
 Avoiding distracted driving, slowing down and being aware of conditions would go a long way toward reducing accidents that involve pedestrians and bicyclists. According to statistics from the Texas Department of Transportation, more than 700 people were killed with another 1,600 seriously injured in crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists.
 Pedestrian-involved accidents now account for some 20 percent of the state’s traffic deaths, and the number is up 5% from 2018 to 2019. Unfortunately, statistics have steadily trended upward the past five years. More than 3,000 accidents involving pedestrians and more than 1,100 involving bicycles took place in metropolitan areas Austin, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio. About half who died last year were between the ages of 21 and 49 with most living in urban areas. More than 70% of pedestrians and 90% of cyclists were male.
 Along that line, the Lubbock area certainly had its share of such accidents in 2019 with 165 pedestrian- and bicycle-involved crashes resulting in 19 fatalities, according to statistics.
 Officials say a primary contributor to these types of accidents is a failure to follow state laws designed to protect pedestrians and bicyclists. It is with that in mind that TxDOT launched a campaign earlier this month encouraging Texans to drive smart, walk smart and bike smart.
 “Whether you’re behind the wheel, on foot, or riding a bicycle, we’re reminding Texans to make traffic safety their number one concern when they’re out and about,” said TxDOT Executive Director James Bass. “The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of looking after ourselves and others in our communities, and we’re asking the public to apply that same responsibility to safely sharing the road and obeying traffic laws.”
 State laws are in place to protect all those who use Texas roads, regardless of whether they are driving, biking or walking. However, drivers should be especially vigilant and do everything they can to protect pedestrians and bicyclists since they are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in a crash with a vehicle. According to state law, drivers are to stop for pedestrians in crosswalks and also yield right of way to pedestrians and cyclists when turning. Likewise, they are to pass bicyclists in a safe manner and give them room to ride.
 Pedestrians are reminded to cross streets only at intersections and in crosswalks. They are to obey traffic and crosswalk signals and use sidewalks when available. When there aren’t sidewalks, they should walk facing oncoming traffic.
 Finally, bicyclists are also required to obey all traffic signs and signals, including red lights and stop signs. Bicyclists should use hand signals when turning or stopping. They should ride with traffic and use bike lanes or as near as possible to the right-hand curb. If riding at night, bicycles should be equipped with a white light on the front and a red light or reflector on the back.
 We encourage all those who share the state’s roads to do so responsibly, to obey all traffic laws, and to make safety the top priority.

That outward, unprovoked and seemingly genuine display of camaraderie and support adds to Howard’s valuable standing among his peers, who’ve voted him a team captain each of his first two varsity seasons.
 “It’s a big priority but a good priority to have. Just knowing everybody is looking at me to be a leader makes me feel good,” Howard said. “I think I set a good example for everybody, a positive example, like no matter what you do, you have to work hard.”
 In a way, the constant big-play threat and versatility Howard provides for an offense with no shortage of playmakers become the accessories in the total package.
 “Obviously, he can’t do it by himself but if anybody would try, it’d be him. I mean, he is the get-on-my-back-and-let’s-go guy. (He was the) highest voted captain on the team, and that’s because he is who he says he is,” Stewart said. “These kids aren’t stupid. I love the fact that they can see through the fluff and try to discern who the true leaders are. He’s E.F. Hutton. When he talks, people will listen. And that’s a burden that he has to bear. If you’re going to talk, don’t say it and then not show it because people will stop listening quick. He’s never to going to stop showing it.”
 Howard showed back in May of 2019 when he was a freshman practicing with the varsity during spring training that what he had to offer — essentially natural talent aided by an established work ethic that stood out because of his young age — elicited a call up.
 So the converted quarterback made his debut against Round Rock Cedar Ridge in last year’s season opener and announced his arrival in the form of 254 yards rushing. He closed last season with 966 yards and 13 TDs, and the honor of District 12-6A’s offensive newcomer of the year. His 2020 has picked up steam over the last two weeks, too, posting back-to-back 100-plus yard efforts, while he continues to garner college scouts’ attention.
 But trying to get the 5-foot-8, 170-pound junior to wander down the road of personal achievement is usually a fruitless endeavor. To Howard, at the end of four quarters, statistics are just figures on a computer screen. What he envisions taking precedence or being most impactful is the manner in which he goes about obtaining those numbers.
 “I don’t really think about yards like that. I just want to play. It’s not even the wins. I’m just happy to be out there representing (Temple). It’s just my passion. It’s just so fun,” Howard said. “It’s something you can’t explain. You can just see it.”
 It took Howard some time to see things that clearly.
 By his own account, and corroborated by Stewart, Howard struggled as a young adolescent with his temper, often wearing frustrations on his sleeve. He said it continues to be a work in progress but that compared to his ninth-grade year, he’s “chilled” and “mellowed out” and credited his parents, Raymond and DeAnna, and his coaches through the years — specifically Robert York, Rodney Johnson, Jason Hoelscher and Kyle Mosley — for helping guide him.
 “The reason I say them is because they’ve been nothing but positive. They want nothing but the best for me. They hold me to a high standard and I know I can fulfill that,” Howard said. “It’s not fun being angry. So, I learned how to cope with it.”
 Stewart has certainly observed a world of difference.
 “He’s grown exponentially in a very short time with that,” Temple’s fifth-year coach said. “It’s really impressive to watch kids grow up and know that your program affects kids the right way. And, I’m not saying we have anything figured out, but to watch a kid learn to focus, that is part of the maturation process. Part is his parents and I’d like to think a huge part of it, too, is having (coaches) in his life helping.”
 Like his Temple idol Jeff Carr (Class of 2015) and former teammate Anthony Jackson (Class of 2020), whom Howard looked up to, he’d like to help the Wildcats (2-1) remain a force with which to be reckoned, starting with a 12-6A opener at 7:30 tonight against host Copperas Cove (1-2).
 Temple’s seven-game district slate continues next Friday at home against Bryan and for the next five weeks as the Wildcats are scheduled to play straight through Nov. 27 before an open date the week before the first round of the Class 6A Division II playoffs.
 “What motivates me is just knowing what Temple’s background is, knowing I have to live up to that standard. It’s not easy to play in Temple. It’s not easy to be in Temple. But, it’s an honor and I know I have to live up to that in a game, even in the fourth quarter when we’re down. I know what (past players) want and I know the standard,” Howard said.
