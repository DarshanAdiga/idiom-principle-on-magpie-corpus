The ruling comes as a weeklong witness testimony is underway in the British Columbia Supreme Court, in a different part of the same extradition case.
 Meng's assertion that the United States misrepresented evidence of alleged fraud in its formal request to Canada for her extradition has an "air of reality," Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes wrote in her decision, dated Wednesday. She also agreed that Meng was entitled to introduce some additional evidence in the case record, "to a limited extent."
 "Some of that evidence is realistically capable of challenging the reliability" of the U.S. request for extradition, Holmes said.
 The office of Attorney General David Lametti did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 Huawei Canada called the decision "a substantial victory," in a statement.
 Canada's Department of Justice said it respects Holmes' decision.
 Meng, 48, was arrested at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 while on a layover bound for Mexico. Meng's case turns on whether she misled HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. The United States has argued she is guilty of fraud for causing the bank to break sanctions against Iran.
 Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting the charges from Vancouver, where she is under house arrest.
 Her arrest caused diplomatic relations between Ottawa and Beijing to become rocky. Soon after her detention, China arrested two Canadian citizens on espionage charges.
 A PowerPoint presentation that Meng gave to an HSBC banker in Hong Kong in 2013, showing Huawei's relationship to Skycom Tech Co. — a firm that operated in Iran — has been cited by the United States as key evidence against her.
 Holmes agreed with Meng that the U.S. request for extradition should have included certain statements from the PowerPoint that add "further precision" to Meng's statements about Huawei's business relationship with Skycom in Iran.
 Holmes flagged one example of potential U.S. misrepresentation of evidence, pointing out that it did not include the phrase "'Huawei' engagement with Skycom is normal and controllable business cooperation, and this will not change in the future.'"
 "A similar statement is included earlier in the summary, but that statement omitted the word 'controllable', reading, 'Huawei's engagement with Skycom is normal business cooperation,'" Holmes said.
 Although Holmes agreed that Meng's arguments were not strong enough to warrant immediate dismissal of the case, she said they "may be capable of doing so when considered together with allegations from the first or second branches," referring to other allegations of abuses of process Meng has put forward.
 Leo Adler, a Toronto-based extradition lawyer who is not involved in the case, said the ruling represented "a good win" for Meng, but added that Holmes "is a very cautious judge."
 In Thursday's witness testimony, a border officer told the court that the impending arrival of Meng at a Canadian airport two years ago meant discussions about the best way to apprehend her had to be cut short.
 Scott Kirkland, an officer with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), had previously told the court he was worried about allegations of civil rights violations if the agency intercepted and interviewed Meng before her arrest by police.
 But he did not bring this concern up with others, in part because they had less than an hour before Meng's flight landed to decide how to handle her interception.
 "It was a rushed discussion," Kirkland said.
 The afternoon's testimony focused on the sequence of events during the border agency's inspection of Meng. The defense suggested that it was improper for Kirkland to have written down her cell phone passcodes on a piece of paper rather than only in his notebook, but he maintained that it is standard procedure.
 Meng's lawyers have argued that abuses of process occurred in the nearly three hours between when CBSA intercepted her and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) arrested her, during which she had no legal representation.
 RCMP Const. Winston Yep, who arrested her, was the first witness in the weeklong testimony. Yep insisted the RCMP stayed in its lane and did not direct the CBSA in its investigation of Meng.
 Canadian government prosecutors have tried to prove that Meng's arrest was by the book, and any lapses in due process should not impact the validity of her extradition.
 Meng's extradition hearings are scheduled to wrap up in April 2021, although the potential for appeals means the case could drag on for years.

The global organic personal care products market is growing at a CAGR of 10.1% during the forecast period (2019-2024). Organic personal care products have been around for many decades; however, they have gained prominent momentum lately due to greater end-user awareness of product safety and growing concerns about the environment, as a result of the use of conventional cosmetic products. Organic personal care product vendors usually target perfectionists, and brand conscious, brand loyal and novelty conscious users, who are more likely to choose organic and natural cosmetic products over synthetic products. The recent trends in the organic personal care market can be dissected by analyzing the types of cosmetic users and their subsequent behaviours. By product type, skin care products segment dominates the global personal care products market.

The IMCCA, a leading voice for UC&C (Unified Conferencing and Collaboration), has announced the first three of a growing series of events to support the collaborative conferencing industry as people embrace working from home during the current pandemic. Webcasts will highlight the UC&C industry’s response to the crisis, the industry topics that would have been discussed at recently postponed conferences, and a virtual global “meal” experience to support the thousands of people now forced to work from home.
 [ _IMCCA Honors Randy Klein, Eric Yuan With Lifetime Achievement Awards_]
 Analysts and experts scheduled to appear on the webcasts include Omdia’s Tim Banting, Frost & Sullivan’s Roopam Jain, Kelcor’s Brent Kelly, IT influencer Evan Kirstel, Nemertes Research’s Irwin Lazar, LetsDoVideo’s David Maldow, Shen Milsom & Wilke’s Mark Peterson, Comfusion’s Blair Pleasant, and more. David Danto of Poly and the IMCCA will host the sessions, which will discuss and analyze the industry’s response, the future of remote working, and the state of the collaboration industry as it would have been presented at any number of recently cancelled events.
 The webcasts will be recorded and posted to the IMCCA website’s video section. They will be available shortly after recording on Tuesday March 17 and Thursday March 19 at approximately 3pm EDT.
 [ _CWNY Panel Talks Streamlining on Team Chat Platforms_]
 In addition, The IMCCA, with the help of the Zoom Video team, will be hosting a live webinar on Wednesday March 18 at Noon EDT to provide support and camaraderie to all those that have been forced to work remotely. Described as a “virtual brown-bag meal to support and celebrate each other as we work from home,” the event will bring together anyone interested in feeling less alone during the current difficult conditions. It will begin as a webcast with a handful of panelists, but then, during the 90-minute duration, everyone who wishes to join and speak will be “promoted” to panelist one at a time so they can have their say and take part the discussion. Click here to register for this webcast.
 “The IMCCA has been the non-profit organization supporting and promoting collaborative conferencing for more than twenty years,” said Carol Zelkin, executive director, IMCCA. “We feel it is our duty to provide information and resources about what UC&C can do--especially during a pandemic that forces everyone to use the tools that we’ve been advocating since we began.”
 David Danto, Poly’s director of strategy and research and The IMCCA’s director of emerging technology, is hosting the events. He explained that “providing impartial industry information and supporting those new to the technology is the least we can do to lend a hand during this crisis. The expert webinars will provide important and interesting discussions, and our virtual dinner for EMEA / lunch for the Eastern U.S. / breakfast for the Western U.S. and midnight snack for any sleepless souls in the AsiaPac region will be a sort of controlled chaos that helps people understand that we are all in this together.” Danto believes this event may turn into the world’s largest videoconference ever.
 These three events are only the first of many that the IMCCA has planned to support the public during the current crisis. Danto explained that if the virtual meal is deemed a success the IMCCA will do it weekly, and extend the opportunity to other video platforms to provide and/or showcase their services.
 In addition to the above, a number of after-work events are also planned, with the first likely being a Virtual Comedy Club--bringing together stand-up comics whose gigs have been cancelled with all the newly homebound people waiting out the crisis. “Our position as the UC&C industry’s only agnostic, non-profit organization for over two decades allows us to rapidly bring together content providers, technology providers, and the general public,” Zelkin added.

Japan had previously issued a Level 3 alert for those regions, warning citizens against all travel.
 But for Myanmar and Jordan, Japan raised its travel advisories to Level 3, in light of an expansion in coronavirus cases, Motegi said. With the addition of the two countries, Japan has now issued Level 3 advisories for 152 countries and regions.
 Separately, Motegi said Japan has lifted another set of travel advisories it had issued for all countries and regions in March in response to the pandemic.
 Such advisories were issued uniformly to alert travelers to the possible risk of becoming stranded on foreign soil due to tightened border controls and the imposition of lockdowns.
 "We will lift the travel alerts for all regions as regular international flights have started to resume," Motegi said.
 "But the alerts remain in place for Syria, Iraq and other regions where the security situation requires caution."
 Japan has been gradually rolling back the border restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as part of efforts to revive its economy.
 Motegi said Japan and Vietnam have also agreed to restart reciprocal business travel from Sunday.
 With the measure, travelers will no longer need to observe a 14-day quarantine upon arrival if they test negative for the coronavirus and turn in itineraries, among other preventive measures.
 Vietnam became the third country with which Japan has resumed travel for people on short-term business trips, following Singapore and South Korea.

Xi's leadership is "seriously eager to tackle environmental issues, so the Chinese market would look very attractive for Japanese firms concentrating on development of eco-friendly products," a businessman familiar with the situation in Beijing said.
 "But we have heard that many Japanese enterprises in China have been struggling to comply with the government's strict environmental regulations and they may lose motivation to continue doing business in the nation," he said.
 Moreover, the Chinese Communist Party has pledged to stick to the dual circulation strategy aimed at strengthening international competitiveness of the country's companies in the field of cutting-edge technology.
 "If Chinese firms can take great strides in the eco-friendly market with the backing of the government and capitalize on world economic growth ahead, Japanese manufacturers could be eventually put in a tough predicament," the businessman added.
 In his address to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Xi vowed to cut greenhouse gas emissions in his nation to net zero by 2060, as Beijing has been keen to take the initiative in the global climate debate.
 For years, China has been stepping up measures to curb air pollution, such as setting stringent emission standards and imposing punishments on companies violating regulations under its determination to "make skies blue again."
 In late October, an influential Chinese industry body composed of senior auto executives and academics said Beijing plans to phase out new sales of gasoline-powered cars and bring eco-friendly ones to the mainstream by 2035.
 "The announcement bodes well for us, given that we have a competitive advantage in the eco-friendly field," an employee of a Japanese automaker said.
 The China Society of Automotive Engineers said all cars sold in 2035 in the world's biggest auto market and most populous country would become "new- energy" vehicles like electric ones or hybrids.
 Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automaker, has said total hybrid car sales in the world's second-biggest economy have exceeded 1 million units, as Beijing has promoted eco-friendly vehicles through subsidies as part of its national strategy.
 Other Japanese firms, however, have complained about China's environmental policies, saying they are too strict to obey.
 According to a survey conducted this year by the Japan External Trade Organization, more than 70% of 233 Japanese companies operating in China answered local regulations are "strict" or "a little strict."
 "Additional equipment to meet standards getting stricter year by year and increasing costs have become burdensome," one of the Japanese firms told the government-backed organization.
 JETRO said five of the 233 Japanese manufacturers have already started to consider transferring their factories or parts of them to other nations amid mounting concern over the future.
 At its four-day key gathering through Thursday, meanwhile, the Chinese Communist Party decided to uphold the dual circulation strategy, as it has argued that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has encouraged a "decoupling" in global markets.
 Long-term goals through 2035, which were also adopted at the meeting, included commitments to making a breakthrough in the high-tech field and improving the modernization of supply chains for the coming 15 years.
 Under the dual circulation strategy, China is expected to put emphasis on fostering the country's enterprises focusing on businesses such as next- generation 5G wireless networks, semiconductors and biopharmaceuticals.
 With Sino-U.S. tensions escalating over several economic and security matters and the outbreak of the novel coronavirus stifling both external and domestic demand, China's economy faced a severe downturn in the first quarter of this year.
 In recent months, the economy has shown signs of a V-shaped recovery due in part to a rebound in investment and industrial production, but the job market and the economic situation in rural areas have remained sluggish.
 Beijing has been apparently forced to make efforts to enhance domestic demand while attempting to boost exports of made-in-China goods to its friendly nations, as many market-oriented economies have become unwilling to actively trade with the Communist-led country.
 "China's ambition to attain carbon neutrality by 2060 may certainly give a tailwind to Japanese companies in the short run, but the dual circulation strategy would deal a blow to them in the medium to long term," another businessman in Beijing said.

Floyd suffocated under the knee of a white policeman. His death, captured on video, triggered huge protests throughout the country and put police reform high on the national agenda.
 There were calls for comprehensive change — ranging from better training to a controversial campaign to "defund the police," with the strongest move coming from the city itself.
 In June, the Minneapolis City Council announced its intention to "dismantle" its police force and "reimagine a new model of public safety."
 Several council members wanted the proposal to be on the ballot on Nov. 3, when local referendums can also be voted on. But the plan was vetoed by an unelected commission.
 Elsewhere in the United States, calls for ambitious police reforms to tackle racism and misconduct have also been toned down as the election nears.
 "We don't hear anything about what they want to change," said Waltower, who trains girls in coding in Minneapolis' poor and predominantly Black northern neighborhoods.
 "It's out of sight, out of mind, but as African Americans, we feel it every day," he said, referring to racial prejudices he's seen from police, including often being stopped in his car.
 The focus has instead shifted to a spike in crime. Since the beginning of the year, the city has already recorded 65 homicides, up from 49 in all of 2019, and an upsurge in shootings.
 We had a "horrific summer," Waltower said. Students from the high school where he works were caught up in exchanges of gunfire.
 For him, the reason is simple: there are fewer officers on the ground, which gives a "green light" to criminals.
 Since Floyd's death and the violent riots and looting that followed, the city's police force has shrunk sharply.
 At least 175 out of about 850 officers have resigned or gone on sick leave, according to a lawyer who represents many of them.
 "The Floyd incident, the riots, the unrest, the total lack of support … has resulted in them just simply saying, 'I can't continue,'" explained attorney Ron Meuser.
 But Stuart Schrader, a sociology researcher at Johns Hopkins University, cautioned against simple explanations.
 For him, the pandemic and its economic impact may have played a bigger role in the increase in crime, also seen in New York and Chicago.

Nearly 10 years after the triple meltdowns at the nuclear power plant in March 2011, prices for agricultural and fisheries products from the prefecture haven’t fully recovered.
 Some producers are still struggling to get retailers to buy their produce. They are concerned that if the government cannot set out detailed measures to tackle the reputational damage, they will need to start all over again from scratch.
 “It’s unprecedented, and it’s hard to predict how much and how long it will last,” said deputy trade minister Kiyoshi Ejima, who heads a government task force on nuclear disasters, in an interview, regarding the harmful rumors. “We can’t offer a comprehensive (aid) package at this point of time.”
 The government is expected to offer measures of support for the farm and fisheries industries, conduct public information campaigns based on science and compensate for damages as a result of releasing the water into the sea.
 But it appears the government has not set out a detailed approach for how it plans to tackle any reputational damage caused by the release.
 Since the 2011 disaster, the prefecture’s fisheries cooperative has only been able to conduct experimental fishing on limited days, with restrictions on the areas fished.
 It is planning to move to full-scale fishing in April, with all 43 types of fish approved to be shipped.
 “What we have been working on will be all for nothing,” said Toshimi Suzuki, 67, who belongs to a cooperative for sea urchin and abalone fishing in the city of Iwaki that is urging the government to decide against releasing the tritium-laced water into the sea. “I want them to listen to the voices of fishermen who are still struggling due to harmful rumors before deciding what measures to take.”
 Farmers are also worried.
 “If the waters are released when people at home and abroad aren’t adequately informed that it’s safe, based on science, harmful rumors will spread again,” said Yasuaki Kato, 44, a farmer who produces rice and apples.
 When Kato worked to promote the safety of Fukushima-made produce in Tokyo, he felt it was extremely difficult to gain the understanding of people from outside Fukushima Prefecture.
 “If people don’t understand the safety of the produce and how it has been made, it won’t have a price tag equivalent to what it’s worth,” Kato said.
 In northern Fukushima Prefecture, fruit farmers were hit by heavy rain last year, after Typhoon Hagibis swept through the region, and were significantly affected by plant disease this year. Koji Suzuki, 69, who harvests peaches and persimmons in the town of Kunimi, says he was only able to harvest about 40% of his fruit compared to normal years.
 He is afraid prices that plummeted after the meltdowns will once again drop.
 “I want (the government) to propose measures on what it will do when consumers avoid produce from Fukushima,” Suzuki said.

 Six seats on the NC District 27 Court are up for grabs this year, but five of them have candidates running unopposed on the ticket. The only contested seat, Seat Five, pits Democrat Angela Woods against Republican Jamie Hodges.
   
 According to their websites, both have more than 15 years legal experience, with Woods spending time as a prosecutor, juvenile defense attorney and social services attorney in her career; Hodges spent his career trying civil and criminal cases ranging from traffic matters to child custody and abuse cases.
   
 Soil and water race
   
 The only nonpartisan race on the ticket is Soil and Water Conservation District Supervisor. The contest sees incumbent candidate Myron Edwards attempting to hold his seat. He is challenged by Madison Rachel Bridges.
   
 Soil and water districts have five supervisors, three of which are elected. The supervisors are responsible for directing county staff who monitor and address environmental issues relevant to their districts. In Cleveland County, soil compaction and erosion are primary areas of concern.

Israeli start-up Salto emerged from mystery on Tuesday by launching its SaaS solution for business application configuration, announcing $27 million in Series A funding led by Bessemer Venture Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Salesforce Ventures.
 Series A funding is one of the stages in the capital-raising process by a start-up. Essentially, the series A round is the second stage of start-up financing and the first stage of venture capital financing.
 Nowadays, modern companies are mostly relying on an increasing number of business applications and services to support their operations, using customer relationship management (CRM), marketing automation, HR and finance platforms such as Salesforce, HubSpot, Marketo and NetSuite.
 The success of the company is inherently linked to the maintaining of these business applications' configurations aligned with the company's rapidly evolving business needs, as difficult as it can be, timewise and work wise speaking.
 That's why business operation teams, also known as BizOps, responsible for configuring and managing these services, need a robust toolbox, automated procedures and enhanced methodologies to help the company scale and prosper.
 Veteran Israeli entrepreneurs Rami Tamir, Benny Schnaider and Gil Hoffer answered that need by creating Salto.
 After their success with previous companies - Pentacom (acquired by Cisco), Qumranet (acquired by Red Hat) and Ravello Systems (acquired by Oracle), these two serial entrepreneurs founded Salto to fundamentally change the way companies configure and manage their business applications.
 "We realized the challenges BizOps teams face are very similar to the problems encountered by software and DevOps engineers on a daily basis", said Salto co- founder and CEO Rami Tamir.
 "So we adapted software development fundamentals and best practices to the BizOps field. There's no need to reinvent the wheel; the same techniques used to make high-quality software can also be applied to keeping control over business applications".
 Salto, which has offered an open source project since early 2020 with an enterprise solution being released today, automatically extracts the configuration elements of different business applications such as fields, flows or processes, and translates them to a new declarative language called NaCl - "Not Another Configuration Language".
 Using NaCl with Git, a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development, the applications' configurations can be collaboratively edited and deployed back to the live business apps, or to a staging environment for testing.
 "Defining a company's business logic as code can make a fundamental change in the way business applications are delivered", said Tamir.
 "We like to think about it as 'company-as-code', much in the same way as 'infrastructure-as-code' transformed the way we manage data centers."  
 With Salto, the different configuration elements are searchable, and major changes can be properly planned, monitored and synchronized across the many business applications a company uses.
 Configuration changes to multiple business applications can be easily tested, tracked or even rolled back if needed.
 While launching its richly-featured enterprise SaaS offering, an open source version of Salto is also available, staying true to the spirit of modern software development.
 "We envision an open ecosystem that doesn't lock users into using Salto alone. Similar to other open source software projects, we foresee a thriving community of members adding their own integrations, solutions and reusable code to share with the community", said Tamir,
 "Business agility is more important than ever today, and the alignment of external business services to real business needs is increasing in strategic importance", said Alex Kayyal, Partner and Head of International at Salesforce Ventures.
 "BizOps teams are becoming more and more crucial to the success of companies. With Salto, they are empowered to meet the tasks they are charged with, equipped with modernized methodologies and a greatly enhanced toolbox".
