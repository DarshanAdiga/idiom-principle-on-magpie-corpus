Several generations later, Shenzhen is a metropolis of skyscrapers, high-tech campuses and huge, modern ports that dwarf Hong Kong's own, at least in trading volume. Railways, roads, bridges and other infrastructure have transformed the Pearl River Delta region that surrounds it into a whole ecosystem of built-up cities that is China's answer to Silicon Valley and then some. It also is home to increasingly influential tech companies like Huawei Technologies and Tencent.

"European Union leaders on Wednesday proposed an $825 billion coronavirus rescue plan that would give Brussels major new tax and spending powers of the sort held by a federal state. Proponents are calling it Europe's 'Hamiltonian moment,' after the 1790 agreement, engineered by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, that transformed the United States from a loose confederation of former colonies into a true federation with a central government. If approved, the E.U. plan could bind the bloc together at a moment when it seemed at risk of spinning apart under the pressure of the novel coronavirus pandemic. If the plan fails -- either to win support or to deliver benefits -- euroskeptic politicians could be emboldened, both in rich nations such as Germany and struggling ones such as Italy…" (Birnbaum et al., 5/27).

Thank you. That’s clear. And on the higher loan balances, I guess, from your answer, I guess, we shouldn’t really expect a similar impact -- a pickup in NII -- a significant pickup in NII this year on the back of the loan growth, because this loan growth comes mainly from the subsidized or guaranteed government programs, is that fair?

Okay. On the retail side, we have been spot on. We had a very ambitious budget for fees and we have exceeded it by a little. So on the retail side everything is -- was moving very well pre-COVID.

In the film, Pete portrayed Scott, whose emotional development had been stunted since his firefighter father died when he was 7 years old. Now in his mid-20s, Scott's dream of becoming a tattoo artist seems far out of reach, due to the fact that his work usually comes out looking unlike what was requested from his client. Scott lived at home with his mother, an ER nurse, and had spent his days smoking pot, hanging out with his friends, and making a veiled attempt to create a relationship with his childhood friend Kelsey. When his mother dated a firefighter named Ray, Scott was forced to take stock in his life and figure out how to move forward, including forging a brotherhood with the FDNY.

iknowhowtofixitThis review reinforces what I have been saying for weeks. The GTX 660Ti is overpriced at $300. Since you can easily find a HD7950 for $300 or less after rebates, it makes the 660TI irrelevant. To me, the 660Ti needs to be $60-$75 cheaper before it can achieve bang for the buck status.it is because of the 660ti that the 7950 prices dropped to $300 or less with MIR: so tell me how irrelevant they are now?

In November 2018 I concluded the quality is paying off in the long run. Shares traded at similar levels as they do today as I recognized stable sales and earnings trends, as well as a well-timed purchase of Wirtgen at the time.
 At the time I noted that the company was basically earning $10-11 per share, what has become reality in 2019. This was based on operating margins seen around 12%, as I noted that the company was enjoying relatively good times at the moment, not too outrageous however.
 Using an estimated 10% margin throughout the cycle, which worked down to a $9 per share number, valuations look reasonable at around $150, making that I was constructive on the shares, yet not actively adding to the shares trading around fair value.
 Fast forwarding in time, shares are down a bit, yet of course the outlook for the current year reveals dismal earnings per share, as this reduced earnings power and challenges of the financial service unit make me a bit cautious.
 For all these reasons I still feel that shares trade around fair value and while I remain constructive on the long run potential of the company and its shares, I am not actively seeing a reason to initiate position here, although Deere has been and excellent steward of capital over the past two decades following the adoption of the EVA concept, executed with real discipline and actions, not just words.

DEAR rugby league, I’m glad you’re back.
 The two-month hiatus felt like an eternity to this footy-loving fan.
 I remember laughing when the ARL chairman Peter V’landys and commission member Wayne Pearce first said May 28 would be the restart date.
 Keyboard warriors were quick to doubt the date, thinking it was an optimistic at best approach.
 “If it restarts on May 28 I’ll run backwards naked down Crown St,” one unnamed punter posted.
 Back then it felt so unlikely. Boy were we all wrong.
 Not only has rugby league returned to our screens and loungerooms, it’s arguably returned a better sport.
 I was critical of the rule changes brought in initially.
 I thought the two refs rule was a mistake and the repeat six would bring more pain than gain.
 Based off the fast flowing footy I saw in Thursday night’s opener between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels, the changes are great.
 The changes benefited the Eels more than my beloved Broncos but they will help the code in the long run.
 Despite no games in 60-something days, weren’t those Eels electric.
 At times it appeared they were offloading at will, with size and power right across the park.
 Brisbane weren’t at their best, brave at times but Parramatta are the real deal.
 What about young miracle man Reed Mahoney who surprised all to overcome a nasty foot injury to play. I thought the Beerwah junior was one of the best on park, his kicking game particularly razor sharp.
 Now rugby league, don’t ever leave us again.
