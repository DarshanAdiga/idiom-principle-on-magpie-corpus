Iran has retrieved some data, including cockpit conversations, from a downed Ukrainian passenger plane, the nation's Civil Aviation Organization said in a report on Sunday.
 The aircraft was accidentally shot down by Iran's Revolutionary Guard forces shortly after takeoff from Tehran in January, killing all 176 people on board. Iran had initially denied responsibility before changing course after Western nations presented extensive evidence that its armed forces were responsible.
 Sunday's announcement marks the first official report on the contents of the cockpit voice and data recordings. The black boxes were sent to Paris in June, where international investigators have been examining it.
 ## Passengers alive after first explosion
 The Ukraine Airlines jetliner was apparently targeted by two missiles. The first exploded shortly after the plane took off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport, possibly damaging the aircraft's radio equipment. The second struck the jet, causing a ball of fire in the air before it crashed into a playground on the outskirts of the Iranian capital.
