A life without a purpose is not worth living. Without purpose, you’ll literally be drifting like a wind. As a rational being, you ought to review your life every day, week, month, year and decade to know where you are headed. We all have dreams and aspirations and actualizing them comes with strength and great thoughts in order for it to see the light of the day. Every employee looks out for promotion, every businessman/woman looks out for that day when they will break even with all necessary tools and resources needed to run a successful business, every student looks out for the day they will graduate and begin to reap the fruit of their labour. A greater tomorrow always comes to those who do what they are meant to do, and if it doesn’t add up, just know, it’s either it’s not meant to happen or the right hour has not yet come.

Which brings us to the game that this 2019 team did not want to talk about: the 2014 season's NFC Championship game. The Pack was coming off the heels of beating the Cowboys 26-21. You know the one…it was where Dez Bryant came down with the football near Green Bay's goal line. Originally ruled a catch but overturned following a challenge from Mike McCarthy, the play more or less led to Green Bay making its second trip to Seattle that season…but with far more on the line.

I guess you are still basking in the euphoria of the New Year. Every New Year always comes with its peculiar challenges. This is because trying to adjust to a new style can be challenging, especially when you have a new product, idea or lifestyle you are hoping to bring on board. It’s worthy of note that every day comes with its own blessings, opportunities, and hope for a better tomorrow if only you can take advantage of the gift of life. Living a fulfilling and successful life entails setting a goal that will make you want to jump out of your bed every morning.

Colombian Leonardo Castro and Serb Samir Nurkovic scored as Kaizer Chiefs celebrated turning 50 by beating Cape Town City 3-0 Sunday to take a nine- point South African Premiership lead.
 Castro and Nurkovic scored headed goals before Eric Mathoho did likewise to give the league leaders a second three-goal victory within five days.
 "We were not great today but scored at the right moments," said Chiefs' German coach Ernst Middendorp.
 "I never had any doubt about the result and wish to compliment my players for a second decisive victory this week."
 Nurkovic has scored nine Premiership goals and Castro seven after 17 rounds and the duo have helped solve a scoring problem that has afflicted Chiefs for years.
 Chiefs have netted 36 times in 17 matches -- the only side among the 16 in the Premiership to average more than two goals a game.
 Formed in January 1970, Chiefs have won an unrivalled 53 domestic trophies, more than clubs founded decades before the Soweto outfit.
 But they have been experiencing tough times in recent seasons with their last success being the 2014/2015 Premiership title.
 Hopes are high within the club, though, that the drought is about to be broken with a fifth league title since the Premiership began in 1996.
 AS well as having from a healthy lead with 13 matches to play, Chiefs are not involved in time-consuming CAF competitions, giving them an edge over title rivals Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits.
 Chiefs have 41 points, Sundowns 32, SuperSport United 31 and Wits 27 in a four-club chase for a record 15 million rand ($1.050 mn, 940,000 euros) first prize.
 Sundowns have played one game less than Chiefs and Wits four fewer, but Premiership teams traditionally struggle to transform matches in hand into maximum points.
 Cape Town City fired coach and former South Africa star Benni McCarthy after poor early season form and results have been even worse under Jan Olde Riekerink.
 The Dutch coach has won only one of seven matches, leaving the club just one point above Black Leopards and Polokwane City, who share last place.
 "We play good football but cannot convert chances into goals," lamented the 56-year-old former Galatasaray manager.
 "Although Chiefs deserved to win, we contributed to our downfall by failing to defend the high crosses which led to all three goals."

Lawmakers, activists demand investigation of '12 ‘rape in Champaign’ email
 “That email is horrifying. If anyone has any information about this crime, please contact authorities,” said Sen. Linda Holmes, an Aurora Democrat and co-chair of the caucus. “Sexual assault will not be tolerated. We need to get to the bottom of this and hold people accountable.”
 Sen. Sue Rezin, a Morris Republican who also co-chairs the caucus, agreed.
 “I am stunned and disturbed that keeping quiet about a rape was so casually offered up as proof of loyalty. This needs to be investigated thoroughly, and anyone who helped cover it up needs to face the consequences,” she said.
 House Republican Leader Jim Durkin, of Western Springs, called the report “one of the most disturbing and shocking set of facts” he’s ever seen and called for accountability.

Ethiopia will hold a parliamentary election in May or June despite concerns about security and logistics, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Sunday.The election will be the first under Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and launched political and economic reforms. His reform agenda has also stoked violence and highlighted ethnic divisions in the country of about 105 million people, and the election board said last June that the security situation could delay the 2020 election.On the schedule, I am not sure whether it is May or June, because the schedule will be declared by the election board but I think we will conduct an election this year because it is a constitutional mandate, Abiy, who is visiting South Africa, said in response to a question at a media briefing with President Cyril Ramaphosa. There might be lots of challenges, not only logistics but also peace and security ... It is better for Ethiopians and for Ethiopian parties to conduct the election on time in a very peaceful and democratic manner, he said.Opposition politicians have warned against any delay in the election, and critics have said that postponing the vote could cause an adverse social reaction, fuel regional conflicts and damage Abiys democratic credentials. Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995 but, with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive.Abiy also said Ethiopia hoped Ramaphosa, who next month assumes a one-year chairmanship of the African Union continental body, would help broker a deal with Egypt over deadlocked talks to develop a new 4 billion dam on the Nile River. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are due to convene on Monday in Washington with the aim of resolving their disagreements by Jan. 15 over the massive hydroelectric dam that Ethiopia is building.He Ramaphosa is a good friend for both Ethiopia and Egypt, also as incoming AU chair he can make a discussion between both parties so as to solve the issue peacefully, Abiy said. The dam dispute has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Egypt and Ethiopia.I believe a solution is possible, said Ramaphosa.

Pat Moss, shown here competing in the East African rally in 1966, raced all over the world
 Despite all Moss's achievements behind a wheel, Wisdom is sceptical about the extent of her influence. "We didn't think of ourselves as pioneers at the time," says Wisdom, "we just went rallying. We left a bit of a legacy, but not much."
 Only one woman has won a World Rally Championship race, France's Michele Mouton, __who won three in 1982 and finished second overall that season. The last woman to enter an F1 grand prix was Italian Giovanna Amati, but she failed to qualify for three races during the 1992 season.
 And while Sir Stirling is undeniably proud of his kid sister and the trail she blazed in a less enlightened era, he is adamant we will never witness a woman spraying champagne atop an F1 podium.
 "Men can combat fear more easily and are better equipped mentally than women," says Sir Stirling. "You're not going to get women competing with the best men. There's a cut-off point where a woman just isn't equipped to do that, in the same way men aren't equipped to have babies."
 What would Pat have said if she heard her big brother talking like that? "I think she'd have a lot to say, actually," says Sir Stirling. "I don't think she would accept it - she would always try to prove you wrong." Less a legacy, more a manifesto.

AUCKLAND, New Zealand - Serena Williams ended a three-year title drought when she beat fellow American Jessica Pegula 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win the singles final at the ASB Classic.
 Williams hadn't won a title since the Australian Open in January 2017, and not since she became a mother to her daughter Olympia, who was court-side to see the victory.
 "It feels good. It's been a long time," Williams said. "I think you can see the relief on my face.
 “I played an incredible opponent today in Jessica and, honestly, it was a great match and I couldn't have played anyone better in the final.”
 The 23-time major winner donated her $43,000 winner's check to the fundraising appeal for victims of Australian wildfires, joining many other tennis stars, such as Ash Barty, Nick Kygrios, Novak Djokovic and Maria Sharapova, who have pledged money to the already months-long fire emergency there.
 U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted: "Congratulations to @serenawilliams on another big win. She is a great player and an even greater person. Our members in Virginia (Tennis) will never forget you!"
 Williams was with Trump at the 2015 opening of the Trump Tennis Center.
 Williams was under pressure at first against the 25-year-old Pegula, playing in her third WTA final, but asserted herself more as the match went on to claim her 73rd win in 98 finals and to add her name to a trophy won by her sister, Venus, in 2015.
 The last three years have been challenging for Williams as she juggled competing demands of tennis and motherhood. But she seemed to turn a corner during a demanding week in which she played both doubles and singles, turning out on all seven days of the tournament.
 She was frequently behind in her matches but showed typical determination to fight her way to the final and overcome Pegula, who ousted former top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki in the semifinals.
 Pegula has been on a steady climb up the rankings since overcoming a serious knee injury two years ago. The daughter of Buffalo Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula, she won her first WTA title in 2019 and appeared to be a star on the rise in all her matches in Auckland.
 Pegula broke Williams in the opening game and was dominant for the first half of the first set, moving Williams around to open up the court for her punishing passing shots. She also chased down everything, making returns that Williams thought out of her reach.
 But Williams visibly called on herself to lift near the middle of the set, breaking to level at 3-3. She then held serve to love and broke Pegula for 5-3, serving out the first set.
 Williams broke Pegula to love in the third game of the second set as she steadily began to dominate. She had three match points on Pegula's serve before clinching the match on serve.

Israeli lawmakers got the backing Sunday of parliament's legal adviser to debate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's immunity request, but the speaker may yet stand in the way.
 Netanyahu has been charged in three separate corruption cases and his immunity request had been expected to delay his court appearance until after March 2 elections.
 But his opponents have sought to kick-start the process and deny the premier immunity before polls, by getting approval to form the necessary parliamentary committees.
 The Knesset's legal adviser on Sunday issued his opinion that speaker Yuli Edelstein -- a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party -- cannot stand in the way.
 Legal adviser Eyal Yinon concluded "the speaker of the Knesset cannot prevent" the two committees being convened, according to a parliamentary statement.
 Edelstein had sought to block the committees being formed and requested a legal opinion on whether he had the authority to do so.
 The speaker on Sunday rejected Yinon's advice, warning that convening the committees would be a "grave mistake".
 "We are just weeks ahead of elections, everybody knows that at such a time the house committee would become a jungle," he said at a press conference.
 Edelstein described the stalemate as "unprecedented".
 It was unclear whether lawmakers could forge ahead and form the parliamentary committees without his approval.
 "I disagree with the Knesset legal adviser's opinion," he said.
 "As far as it depends on me, I will not lend a hand in turning the committee to a place of cheap election propoganda," Edelstein added.
 The legal opinion followed a request to launch the process by parties representing 65 lawmakers -- a majority of the 120 Knesset members -- in favour of denying Netanyahu immunity.
 The centrist Blue and White alliance, which holds 33 seats, proceeded Sunday with a bid to force the issue.
 The alliance's Avi Nissenkorn chairs a key committee which in turn can convene the crucial House Committee to deal with the immunity request.
 "I have asked... Nissenkorn to convene the Arrangements Committee as soon as possible and to establish the House Committee to debate Netanyahu's request," Blue and White leader Benny Gantz said in a statement.
 The prime minister was charged by the attorney general in November with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases.
 The Likud leader denies the allegations and accuses prosecutors and the media of a witch hunt.
 Under Israeli law, a sitting prime minister is only required to step down once convicted of an offence and after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted.
 Likud and Blue and White were deadlocked in April and September elections, prompting a third national poll within a year.

Ethiopia will hold a parliamentary election in May or June despite concerns about security and logistics, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Sunday.
 The election will be the first under Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and launched political and economic reforms. His reform agenda has also stoked violence and highlighted ethnic divisions in the country of about 105 million people, and the election board said last June that the security situation could delay the 2020 election.
 "On the schedule, I am not sure whether it is May or June, because the schedule will be declared by the election board but I think we will conduct an election this year because it is a constitutional mandate," Abiy, who is visiting South Africa, said in response to a question at a media briefing with President Cyril Ramaphosa. "There might be lots of challenges, not only logistics but also peace and security ... It is better for Ethiopians and for Ethiopian parties to conduct the election on time in a very peaceful and democratic manner," he said.
 Opposition politicians have warned against any delay in the election, and critics have said that postponing the vote could cause an adverse social reaction, fuel regional conflicts and damage Abiy's democratic credentials. Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995 but, with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive.
 Abiy also said Ethiopia hoped Ramaphosa, who next month assumes a one-year chairmanship of the African Union continental body, would help broker a deal with Egypt over deadlocked talks to develop a new $4 billion dam on the Nile River. Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan are due to convene on Monday in Washington with the aim of resolving their disagreements by Jan. 15 over the massive hydroelectric dam that Ethiopia is building.
 "He (Ramaphosa) is a good friend for both Ethiopia and Egypt, also as incoming AU chair he can make a discussion between both parties so as to solve the issue peacefully," Abiy said. The dam dispute has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Egypt and Ethiopia.
 "I believe a solution is possible," said Ramaphosa.

Ballard and Reich are watching every minute of every game and cataloging a to- do list for this spring. They’ll take their conclusions back to their respective staffs and hold the meetings that will shape the team’s additions through the NFL draft and free agency.
 Most of the outside attention will naturally focus on the quarterback and the ways in which the Colts’ passing game can improve. Reich already has acknowledged the need to be better in the passing game on both sides of the ball.
 But the self-evaluation won’t end there.
 What happened over the final two months of the regular season, and how can it be fixed?
 “That’s an answer we have to figure out,” Ballard said during his annual postseason media availability. “I remember sitting there at 5-2 and thinking, ‘Man, we have a pretty good football team,’ but also thinking, we’d won some really tight, tight games. Usually, that pops back around on you. You don’t always win those out.
 “Point differential is big. I always look at it. I think we about plus-8 or 9, always hovering right in that middle area. We were winning tight games and then, in the second half of the season, we weren’t winning those tight games. Whether it was a failure offensively or a failure in the kicking game or a failure defensively, in each of those tough losses, something would go wrong where we would not make a play.”
 Some mistakes were big and obvious.
 Defensive lineman Margus Hunt misread a block on the field-goal unit during the fourth quarter against the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 1, and a potential go- ahead kick was blocked and returned for the game-winning touchdown.
 Veteran Adam Vinatieri – who struggled throughout the season before going on injured reserve for the final four weeks – shanked a potential game-winning field goal in the closing minutes at Pittsburgh nearly a month earlier on Nov. 3.
 Other losses were tougher to boil down to a single moment.

Dice que tiene el alma partida desde que pisó Siria. Es que para Carla Ortiz, una cosa es lo que dicen los noticiarios, y otra muy distinta es estar en el corazón de la guerra, "face to face".      La actriz cochabambina se encuentra en la república árabe en la faceta de productora de un documental. Anteriormente ya produjo para el filme Olvidados, que estará en las bibliotecas del congreso de Estados Unidos y de la universidad GeorgeTown.      Dice que una de sus grandes pasiones es la filantropía, y que grabar este formato le ayuda. Tiene como meta dar voz a las mujeres sirias, víctimas de la violencia de esta contienda.      Carla asoció la productora boliviana Flor de Loto Pictures Srl con la productora libanesa Moon and Stars Production, de la analista política y famosa productora Roula Tajl. La primera parte del trabajo duró dos meses y en mayo arranca la segunda. Después viene la parte de la posproducción, que se realizará entre Bolivia, Argentina y el Oriente Medio. En primera instancia, el documental se estrenará en festivales, luego en salas de cine y, finalmente, se pasará en la televisión en el mes de septiembre.      El mayor desafío de Carla consistirá en comprimir más de 30 horas de entrevistas grabadas en un producto audiovisual de una hora y media, que sea capaz de transmitir toda la sensibilidad que despierta una guerra de esta magnitud. Para este cometido se unió a profesionales de la talla de Ahmad Dakroub, famoso director de fotografía de guerra.      El lado sensible de Carla   “Nos hemos acostumbrado a ver la guerra en Siria y de los refugiados como un titular más del noticiero, que brinda número de muertos y heridos en 30 segundos. Estamos adormecidos con el dolor porque creemos que están lejos y no sabemos que detrás de estas guerras, hay potencias involucradas. No podemos seguir ignorando a una nación cuyo llanto ensordece”, dice la cochabambina.      Bajo este argumento, Ortiz pretende que su trabajo desenmascare la verdad a través de las voces de mujeres sirias que han perdido a sus hijos y que hasta tienen prohibido llorarlos.   “He sentido mi alma partirse al escuchar las historias de víctimas de un extremismo religioso que aterroriza día a día”, opina y agrega que no puede dar adelantos de la trama del filme: “eEs imposible por cuestiones de seguridad”
