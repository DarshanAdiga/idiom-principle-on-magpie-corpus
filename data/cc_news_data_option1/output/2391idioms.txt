While coughing, fever and difficulty in breathing are common symptoms of COVID-19, a new case study has found that pink eye is also a reason to be tested for the disease. The study, published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, determined that conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis can also be primary symptoms of COVID-19. The researchers noted that in March, a 29-year-old woman arrived at the Royal Alexandra Hospital's Eye Institute of Alberta with a severe case of conjunctivitis and minimal respiratory symptoms. After the patient had undergone several days of treatment with little improvement -- and after it had been determined that the woman had recently returned home from Asia -- a resident ordered a COVID-19 test. The test came back positive, according to the researchers. "What is interesting in this case, and perhaps very different to how it had been recognised at that specific time, was that the main presentation of the illness was not a respiratory symptom. It was the eye," said Carlos Solarte, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. "There was no fever and no cough, so we weren't led to suspect COVID-19 at the beginning. We didn't know it could present primarily with the eye and not with the lungs," Solarte said. Academic studies at the outset of the pandemic identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptoms in about 10 to 15 per cent of COVID-19 cases, he said. Since then, scientists have gained greater knowledge of how the virus can transmit through and affect the body's mucous membrane system, of which the conjunctiva -- the clear, thin membrane that covers the front surface of the eye -- is an extension. While the finding provides important new health information for the public, it also makes eye exams more complicated for ophthalmologists and staff, the researchers noted. "The patient in this case eventually recovered well without any issues. But several of the residents and staff who were in close contact with the patient had to be under quarantine," said Solarte. "Fortunately, none who were involved in her care also tested positive," he said. Patients coming into an eye clinic with conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis are now treated as potential cases of COVID-19 and extra precautions are taken by staff, according to the researchers.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) - A popular demand among demonstrators is to defund the police to fund other social programs to shift how cities respond to public safety.In light of recent local unrest, some community activists in Louisville’s West End imagined what defunding the police could look like.Hours after the West End Kroger was boarded up and looted this month, Shauntrice Martin launched Feed The West, a nutritional lifeline to residents in the city’s biggest food desert. Two weeks later, at the Boys and Girls Club in the Parkland neighborhood, she is still at it, distributing food and essentials to 900 people a day.“About two thirds of our stuff comes from donors,” Martin said.It costs about $9,000 a day just to keep going. Donations are good, but Martin said she could always use more. She was asked what she would do with $1 million.“We would open a grocery store location that is permanent, that was big enough for people to come in,” Martin said. “You would have it to where they could volunteer if they don’t have money to pay.”Martin has strong opinions on where the money should come from. Demonstrators demanding change after the March 13 death of Breonna Taylor have called for defunding the police, while spending more tax dollars on improving quality of life and attacking the root causes of poverty.“Defunding the police means revitalizing my community in a way that doesn’t displace us,” Martin said. “It means that we can have grocery stores with fresh food at any time of the day. It means that our students have a healthier learning environment. So it means health and wellness across the board ... I don’t think it’s taking it from the police. I think it’s rerouting it to what their purpose is, which is to protect and serve. If I had it my way, I would have at least half of that. At least.”In looking at the numbers, the LMPD budget seems like an easy target. Police expenses in Fiscal Year 2019 topped $229 million. That’s $15 million more than expenses for economic development, Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods, Parks and Recreation, Community Services, Public Health and Wellness and Public Libraries ... combined.“If the majority of your budget is being spent on things that do not improve the community, that do not enhance our opportunities, then there’s not going to be a positive outcome,” Martin said.A defunded LMPD would have to keep the peace with fewer officers, less equipment and potentially less responsibility if calls involving domestic violence, mental health and homelessness were handled by other professionals. But doesn’t less spending on police also mean less public safety? When questioned in December about the city’s escalating number of homicides, then-LMPD Chief Steve Conrad said LMPD “took a $5,500,000 cut in our budget this year. That’s the police department alone. We’re looking to take a similar or another sizeable cut next year. Less resources for law enforcement will lead to increases in crime, and that’s just a reality.”Community investment specialist Jeana Dunlap offered a different view.“You put more officers on the street, they’re going to find more crime,” she said.Dunlap spent a decade working in redevelopment for Louisville Metro. She pointed to the Parkland neighborhood, the corner of 38th and Dumesnil, for a brief history lesson. The once-thriving business district was hit by looters during deadly race riots in 1968. Investment stopped and the community never recovered.“People didn’t even have the voice (then) to suggest defunding police,” she said. “Black people were not even empowered to raise those types of questions.”If the Parkland neighborhood would have received some of the funding set aside for law enforcement, it would look different today, Dunlap said.“Especially if the people themselves were given the opportunity to manage and administer the funds,” she said.Since the 2003 merger, LMPD expenses appear to have been relatively constant, ranging from a low 19.7 percent of total city expenses in 2006, to a high of 23.9 percent in 2017. But the actual dollar amounts tell another story. After the merger, LMPD expenses amassed a 16-year total of $2,587,265,271.“That’s a lot of commas,” Dunlap said. “That’s a lot of money. And to think of what we could do with that level of investment in West Louisville. We would absolutely see significant change here.”A recent nationwide poll by Morning Consult found 43 percent of registered voters are in favor of redirecting police funding to communities.Copyright 2020 WAVE 3 News.

Voting for three vacant Rajya Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh concluded on Friday afternoon after all the 206 MLAs, including a Congress legislator who has tested Covid-19 positive, cast their votes.Voting began at 9 am in the state assembly complex here and ended around 1.15 pm, an assembly official said.The Congress legislator, who is a Covid-19 patient, was the last one to cast his ballot wearing a PPE suit. He came to the assembly complex in an ambulance, the official said.Both the parties- the BJP and the Congress- had fielded two candidates each for the three seats of the Upper House of Parliament.While the BJP fielded senior leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and former professor of a government college, Sumer Singh Solanki, from the Congress's side, veteran politician Digvijaya Singh and Dalit leader Phool Singh Baraiya were in the fray.BJP members, including state Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, cast their votes in the morning.Former chief minister Kamal Nath and other Congress leaders also cast their ballots soon after the process began.Chouhan was the first member to cast vote, followed by the Home Minister Narottam Mishra.The members were seen wearing masks and standing in a queue maintaining social distance in view of Covid-19 pandemic. For winning a seat in the Rajya Sabha polls from MP, a candidate needs 52 votes. As per the numerical strength of the two parties, BJP is set to win two seats as it has 107 MLAs of its own and has the support of two MLAs of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), one MLA of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and two Independents, party sources said.The saffron party has the support of 112 in the 230 member Assembly whose effective strength is 206. Scindia and Solanki, thus, can get the 52 votes each needed for victory.Leaders of the BSP and the SP said they voted in favour of the BJP. Talking to reporters after the polls, SP's Rajesh Shukla said, "It is our compulsion to go with the government.I have voted for the BJP on my own for the development of the area. There was no directive from the party leadership on the issue." BSP's Sanjeev Kushwaha said, "The Congress government collapsed not because of us, but due to its internal differences. There was no directive from the party for us.Therefore, we voted for the BJP on our own for the development of our region. The BSP will contest the upcoming by-polls on all the seats." In the 230-member Madhya Pradesh assembly, 24 seats are currently vacant.Congress has been left with 92 MLAs after 22 of its legislators, including six who were ministers then, quit the party in support of Scindia's move to join the BJP.Thus, Congress is set to win a single seat out of the total three for which polls are being held, sources added.The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) had asked 54 of its 92 MLAs to cast their first preference vote for Digvijaya Singh. The former chief minister needs 52 votes to get elected to Rajya Sabha for the second consecutive term.Baraiya, placed after Singh in the pecking order by his party, does not have the numbers on his side to win.The counting of votes will begin at 5 pm.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its frontal organisations, especially the youth and student fronts, have distributed rations in pockets in rural and urban areas of West Bengal during and after the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.They also reached out to the affected people in parts of south Bengal with food and relief materials after the devastating Cyclone Amphan hit the state on May 20.The Communist leaders said their outreach programme amid the twin calamities has nothing to do with next year's crucial assembly polls, where the battle lines are being drawn between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and its primary rival, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Leaders of both these parties also maintained that the outreach programme would not help the Marxists garner votes during the next year's assembly elections. "We're only trying to help the affected people. This has nothing to do with elections. We collected donations from the masses to help the poor and needy. The Marxists did this even during the 1943 Bengal famine. The TMC and BJP have hit the streets with relief provided by the Centre amid allegations of rampant corruption," said Tanmoy Bhattacharya, a CPI(M) member of legislative assembly (MLA) from Dum Dum North.The Left Front has 23 seats in the 294 Bengal assembly, while the BJP had managed to win three seats in the 2016 polls but has since increased its tally to 16 because of defections. The ruling TMC's strength has gone up to 224 from 211."Engineering defection is a common practice for both the TMC and the BJP. They will try it again before the polls. Some lawmakers will fall for the temptation, but most will stick to their ideology," said Bhattacharya.Senior BJP leaders, including Bengal unit president Dilip Ghosh, have often said that many leaders from other parties are eager to join the saffron outfit.A few among those, who had helped the BJP win 18 of the state's 42 Lok Sabha seats in 2019, had defected from the TMC. The BJP's major vote share, however, came from Left supporters.BJP leaders glossed over the CPI(M)'s outreach in Amphan-hit areas."Around 12 community block areas in the south Bengal districts are the worst hit. We've done more work in these areas than the Marxists. Their efforts will have no effect on the elections. The writing is clearly on the wall," said Sayantan Basu, state general secretary, BJP."If you dig deep, you'll find that CPI (M) leaders have a tacit understanding with TMC," he added.The TMC is unfazed by the CPI (M)'s renewed vigour. "Our party is working on the ground and helping people. Opposition parties don't figure anywhere," said Jyotipriyo Mullick, state food and supplies minister."The Marxists' vote share has gone down to 7% in last year's Lok Sabha polls. It cannot get any worse. A section of traditional Left voters, who had shifted their allegiance to the BJP in 2019, may vote for the CPI (M) again next year," said Udayan Bandopadhyay, a Kolkata-based political science professor. CPI (M) cadres are keeping up the heat on the ruling TMC by highlighting the state government's failure in providing employment to migrant workers, who have returned home amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, and also rampant corruption in the public distribution system (PDS), which supplies free ration to the general public.The state government has booked 70 PDS dealers for their alleged malpractices.

ATLANTA (AP) — Atlanta police officers called out sick to protest the filing of murder charges against an officer who shot a man in the back, while the interim chief acknowledged members of the force feel abandoned amid protests demanding massive changes to policing.Interim Chief Rodney Bryant told The Associated Press in an interview that the sick calls began Wednesday night and continued Thursday, but said the department had sufficient staff to protect the city. It’s not clear how many officers called out.“Some are angry. Some are fearful. Some are confused on what we do in this space. Some may feel abandoned,” Bryant said of the officers. “But we are there to assure them that we will continue to move forward and get through this.”Prosecutors brought felony murder and other charges against Garrett Rolfe, a white officer who shot Rayshard Brooks after the 27-year-old black man grabbed a Taser during a struggle and ran, firing it at the officer, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said.Four months before Brooks was killed, Reconnect, a company that focuses on fighting incarceration and addiction, interviewed him about the year he spent in jail. He said the criminal justice system treats the people incarcerated within like “animals.”“Some of the system could, you know, looks at us as individuals,” Brooks said. “We do have lives, you know, we’re just a mistake we made.”He said having a record hindered the formerly incarcerated from trying to “provide for ourselves as far as getting a job and getting ourselves back on track.”Howard said Brooks was not a deadly threat at the time and that Rolfe kicked the wounded man and offered no medical treatment for over two minutes as Brooks lay dying. Another officer, Devin Brosnan, who the district attorney said stood on Brooks’ shoulder as he struggled for his life, was charged with aggravated assault and violation of his oath.Rolfe and Brosnan both contend their actions were justified and turned themselves in Thursday. Jail records show Brosnan was released on a signature bond, meaning he only has to pay if he fails to show up for court, while Rolfe was being held without bond. Rolfe was fired and Brosnan placed on desk duty.A few hours after reporting to the Fulton County jail in Atlanta, Rolfe was moved to the jail in neighboring Gwinnett County, according to online records.The decision to prosecute the officers came less than five days after the killing rocked a city — and a nation — still reeling after George Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis set off nationwide protests that have urged an extensive rethink of policing and an examination of racism in the United States.L. Chris Stewart, a lawyer for Tomika Miller, Brooks’ widow, told reporters the charging of the officers brought the family no joy.“Some people thought that we’d be happy and be celebrating and have a fist in the air, but it’s more a disappointment that this is the state of policing and this is where we’re at,” he said.In his video interview with Reconnect, Brooks, a father, promised to “keep going until I make it to where I want to be.”Bryant, who took over after the previous chief resigned resigned in the wake of the shooting, wore a navy blue shirt Thursday, rather than the white shirt typically worn by command staff, to show solidarity with the officers.In the roughly three weeks since protests first broke out in Georgia's capital, officers have worked shifts of 12 or more hours and have been yelled at, spit on and had things thrown at them, Bryant said.“At some point, people get tired, I recognize that, and physically exhausted,” he said. “We will definitely get beyond it, and I’m certain that we will see our sick-outs drop back to normal, average.”The weeks since Floyd's killing have seen lawmakers pass police reforms, Americans reconsider statues commemorating controversial figures, and ideas like defunding police become part of the national conversation. But the drive for change has also drawn pushback, and divisions over the role police should play are becoming a major political flashpoint.Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, issued a strong message of support for police Thursday.“We remember those who died in the line of duty and their families, who still mourn their passing,” he said in a video his office posted to social media.While some have hailed the prosecutor’s office for moving quickly in the Brooks killing, Bryant said he was surprised at the speed, noting that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation hadn’t yet finished its probe.He would not say how many officers called out. But just one officer showed up for work Thursday morning in one zone, which several dozen are assigned to patrol, according to Vince Champion, southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers.Atlanta officers are walking off their shifts or not responding to calls because they feel “abandoned, betrayed, used in a political game,” Champion told the AP.Champion said he’s heard from several officers that they fear using force to protect themselves will get them fired or arrested.Brooks’ funeral is set for Tuesday at Atlanta’s historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‘s congregation, the Rev. Raphael Warnock announced. Tyler Perry, the actor and filmmaker, has offered financial help for the services, officials said.Warnock urged people to remember all the lives lost in recent weeks in interactions with police.“Tragically and involuntarily they all have become visible victims in an urgent public conversation about justice and fairness in our nation,” said Warnock.Police in Atlanta were called to a Wendy's last week over complaints of a car blocking the drive-thru lane and found Brooks asleep behind the wheel. A breath test showed he was intoxicated. Officers had a relatively calm conversation with Brooks before things rapidly turned violent when they tried to handcuff him.Rolfe shot Brooks after he grabbed a Taser, fired it and ran, Howard, the prosecutor, said. But when the officer fired, Brooks was too far from him for the Taser to be a danger, and it had already been fired twice, so it was empty, Howard said.Rolfe’s lawyers said he feared for his and others’ safety. Rolfe opened fire after hearing a sound “like a gunshot and saw a flash in front of him,” apparently from the Taser.The felony murder charge against Rolfe, 27, carries life in prison or the death penalty, if prosecutors decide to seek it. He was also charged with 10 other offenses punishable by decades behind bars.The district attorney said the other officer, Brosnan, 26, is cooperating with prosecutors and will testify. But his attorneys said he hasn't agreed to be a witness for prosecutors.One of his lawyers, Don Samuel, said Thursday that Brosnan suffered a concussion during the struggle with Brooks and put his foot on Brooks only briefly when he heard gunshots because he didn't know where they were coming from and was worried Brooks may have had access to a weapon.___Associated Press writer Jeff Martin in Atlanta contributed to this report.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

There has been a constant debate around the saliva ban for the past few months. Since the novel coronavirus pandemic shut down the world, cricket action has been postponed for more than 3 months. The International Cricket Council announced a slew of measures for the resumption of cricket which included a ban on using saliva to shine the ball. This resulted in current and former players calling for new measures as the game became heavily tilted towards the batsmen. There has been a suggestion that wax could be used in the interim period to shine the ball. The first cricket series to be played since the shutdown is between England and West Indies. The series will give more clarity on the future of the game in this Covid-19 world. However, West Indies pacer Kemar Roach has also said that cricket is now favouring the batsmen and has backed the idea of using wax to shine the cricket ball.Roach also liked the idea of taking a second new ball after 50-55 overs during an innings of a Test match to ensure balance between bat and ball.The International Cricket Council (ICC) has already announced a temporary ban on applying saliva to the ball as a precautionary measure against the coronavirus. With this, many former and current players are suggesting some alternative ways to maintain the balance between bat and ball.In an interaction with ANI from Manchester, Roach said that bowlers need to be given a chance and it should be ensured that the game does not tilt towards the batsmen."It is tough to gauge at this point. I have grown up playing cricket my entire life, using saliva to shine the ball. I guess we can try a wax and see how it works, but the new ball every 50 overs is a decent idea as well. At least give the bowlers a chance," Roach told ANI."I think, right now, things are tilted towards the batting side. We have to experiment and try to find ways to balance the cricket and ensure we are keeping bowlers interested in the game," he added.Earlier, former Australian pacer Brett Lee had also thrown his weight behind applying wax to shine the cricket ball. In an interaction with Sachin Tendulkar on Master Blaster's app '100 MB', Lee had said that a substance can be used which is okay for both batsmen and bowlers.During the chat, Tendulkar had also suggested taking a new ball after every 50 overs in an innings of a Test match to give bowlers something to play with.Earlier, the ICC had said that players will not be permitted to use saliva to shine the ball. If a player does apply saliva to the ball, the umpires will manage the situation with some leniency during an initial period of adjustment for the players, but subsequent instances will result in the team receiving a warning.A team can be issued up to two warnings per innings but repeated use of saliva on the ball will result in a 5-run penalty to the batting side. Whenever saliva is applied to the ball, the umpires will be instructed to clean the ball before play recommences.All international cricket has been suspended since March due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the action is set to resume in July as England and West Indies will take on each other in the three-match Test series.The first Test of the series will be played from July 8.

PUNE, India, June 19, 2020 PRNewswire -- Despite the nationwide slowdown in business activity, the burgeoning interest of investors in stock trading is evident. The lockdown period witnessed a surge of new investors opening demat accounts, along with an increase in internet based trading. In order to benefit from the opportunity in the stock market, investors face a choice between a traditional full-service brokerage and a discount brokerage. While the former offers a number of services, their brokerage charges are linked to trade volumes which results in high brokerage costs, often impeding the investors to trade more often. Discount brokerages, on the other hand, give an investor the scope to trade more frequently. The discount broking industry in India, however, is relatively new, with not many established names. This is where Bajaj Financial Securities Limited holds a unique position. While offering the best-in-class discount broking services, it brings to the table the legacy of a trusted brand- Bajaj Finance Limited which is the holding company of Bajaj Financial Securities Limited BFSL. Thus, investors can benefit from its stability and pedigree that has rendered it a leadership position in the consumer finance sector in India.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Firefighters from Tennessee have been deployed to the western U.S. to help battle wildfires, officials said. Tennessee's Division of Forestry said in a news release Thursday that 20 incident commanders, tree removers and firefighters have been sent to central New Mexico to help local fire departments fight wildfires in that region. An additional forestry staff member has been sent to Arizona to manage equipment for a team assigned to the Bush Fire, currently the largest fire in the country, officials said. The state forestry division’s Fire Management Unit spent the past year building capacity to send employees to out-of-state wildfires and other emergency incidents, officials said. “When the threat is low and we have enough resources to meet demands in Tennessee, we want to lend a hand and provide assistance to other states,\" Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Hatcher said in a statement.
