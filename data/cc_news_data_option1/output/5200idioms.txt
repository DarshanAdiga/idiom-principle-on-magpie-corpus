Earlier this year, police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) called for "greater scrutiny" of the use of Tasers by officers after a series of incidents and concerns about the "disproportionate" use of the weapon against black people and those with mental health problems.
 This came after the Home Office said it would spend £6.5 million on 8,000 more stun guns for police.
 The figures also showed being under the influence of alcohol was another common factor, being highlighted in 180,000 or 37% of incidents.
 In 68% of the incidents (335,000), the reason given for an officer using force was in a bid to protect themselves, the report said.
 Of the total number of incidents, there were 10,711 where officers were injured as a result of an intentional assault. Some 256 of these were classed as "severe" injuries.

_Hannibal_ has also been frequently rumored for a potential Season 4 revival, and while there's no official news of any sort, Mikkelsen has always seemed to be on board if the opportunity ever arose. That said, the world has become a different place since 2015, and one would be fair to wonder if the performer has changed as well. Is such a specific, intense role such a thing an actor-- even one as talented as Mikkelsen--can just flip a switch and jump back into?
 "I wish to say yes," he says. "I think we know the character so well at this point that it hopefully wouldn't take as long to be back on track, back in that three-piece suit and enjoying life the way Hannibal only can."
 At the same time--and he even alludes to this--that's a character who is just...so much. The cannibalism and extreme violence are the parts of _Hannibal_ that people always talk about, but what flies under the radar is the fact that Mikkelsen's Hannibal is constantly engaging in psychological warfare. Even more than Anthony Hopkins' three cinematic portrayals, Mikkelsen plays Hannibal as almost less man than just constant, creeping, evil. As much as Hugh Dancy's Will Graham, or Laurence Fishburne's Jack Crawford think they're in control, it's always Hannibal holding all the cards.

Here is a story of unintended consequences. Deschutes County voters opted to not lift a moratorium on more marijuana grow or processing operations within the county’s borders.
 Because of that moratorium, the county cannot collect any tax money on current operations now in place or in the future.
 A county only receives the money if it allows all licensed recreational marijuana activity to take place within the county, according to Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the Oregon Liquor Control Commission in a story by Bulletin reporter Brenna Visser.
 “When Deschutes County Commissioners voted to put a ban on allowing further licensed marijuana production that essentially became the point in time which the count(y) was no longer eligible to receive its portion of the 17% state tax collected at point of sale,” Pettinger said in an email. “Even though existing producers are allowed to continue production, and even though retail activity takes place in Deschutes County.”
 Before the moratorium, the county was receiving about 4% of the revenue from the state’s marijuana revenue fund that gets shared with the counties. If the moratorium was not in place, the county would have received roughly $514,000 from December 2019 to this September, Visser reported. That’s nothing to sneeze at.
 But it feels like the county is trying to split hairs here with its filing of a complaint for declaratory judgment in state tax court against the Oregon Department of Revenue, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and Department of Administrative Services.
 The county thinks the law is being interpreted too narrowly. Perhaps. But when legalization was first passed in Oregon, counties could opt out in allowing sales, unless voters overruled them. As a result, they received little or no tax revenue from marijuana sales. It was a moral issue for some counties, cities and towns.
 Deschutes County is the only county in Oregon to opt in to marijuana and then subsequently opt out of permitting a segment of the marijuana market.
 While it may feel it rightly deserves the tax revenue that is available from existing operations , the issue most likely will have to be resolved by the liquor control commission or by the Legislature. It is probably worth a shot, but since it only involves one county out of 36, it has a tough hill to climb. Unintended consequences.

Jagr, 48, confirmed yesterday that he will return for at least one more season playing for the Kladno Knights of the Czech Republic's Extraliga, according to a tweet from _Sportsnet_ 's Chris Johnston.  
 If Jagr does indeed suit up for the Knights, it will mark his 33rd year as a pro hockey player, 24 of which were played in the NHL. A surefire lock for the Hall of Fame once he's eligible, Jagr is widely regarded as one of the most elite hockey players of all-time, winning five scoring titles throughout the '90s and early 2000s. His 1,921 career points are second only to Wayne Gretzky.

By Jeff Olson IMSA Wire Service It has been, to say the least, a positive few weeks of news for the future of global sports car racing. First, Audi disclosed in late November that it planned to build a new LMDh prototype sports car when it debuts in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2023 and also return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which it won 13 times before departing in 2016. Then, on Tuesday, Porsche AG announced similar plans to build its own LMDh car to compete in IMSA and the FIA World Endurance Championship. More positive news surrounding 2023 is expected shortly, IMSA President John Doonan said Wednesday. “You want it to be the right business model, but the other piece is when you have people step up to the plate and make a commitment,” Doonan said. “I don’t know if it will be before the end of the year, but definitely in the first quarter of 2021, fingers crossed, we’ll have a few more announcements.” Plans for the new LMDh class were announced by IMSA and Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO) officials at Daytona International Speedway on the eve of the 58th Rolex 24 At Daytona. It will replace IMSA’s top prototype class, Daytona Prototype international (DPi), for the 2023 season. The LMDh will have the same spine -- the car without bodywork, engine or hybrid system -- as the next generation of the Le Mans Prototype 2 (LMP2) car. Four constructors – Dallara, Ligier, Multimatic and ORECA -- will build the spines, with individual manufacturers providing engines and bodywork. Bosch, Williams Advanced Engineering and Xtrac will work together to provide the spec hybrid powertrain systems, with a combined power output of more than 670 horsepower (500 kilowatts). Manufacturers are keen on the hybrid platform because of increasing sales of hybrid production vehicles. More than 5 million hybrid cars were on the road in the U.S. at the end of 2019, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “One of the things that has made all of us so happy and proud of LMDh is that it emulates what the manufacturers … have wanted for a while,” Doonan said. “It emulates what our audience has wanted for a while, and that is the ability for the best drivers, the best manufacturers and the best cars to compete on a global stage in and behind the same ruleset.” The new class has been a long time in the making. After extensive talks among manufacturers, constructors and sanctioning bodies, the plan to include hybrid engine technology as part of a top prototype class was announced in January 2020. “No decisions were made in a vacuum,” Doonan said. “It was a sort of all hands on deck, meaning the ACO and IMSA leading the way, the manufacturers and the chassis constructors from LMP2 -- Dallara, Ligier, Multimatic and ORECA -- and everybody around the table initially had mental skin in the game to do the right thing for the sport.” Porsche’s announcement was greeted with almost universal praise from drivers, teams and manufacturers, including people likely to be competing against Porsche when the new class debuts in 2023, and those likely to be piloting the new car. “Porsche will join LMDh in 2023,” tweeted Porsche factory driver Laurens Vanthoor. “Fighting for overall victory in @FIAWEC and @IMSA! My dream to win Le Mans/Daytona might come true after all. Super exciting news for all of us.” Doonan said more than a dozen manufacturers have been involved in the LMDh discussions, and he expects more to join Porsche and Audi in committing to the class. The DPi class currently includes Acura, Cadillac and Mazda. “Several others have indicated that they are moving down the process of approval,” Doonan said. “(That) gives all of us hope that come 2023 there could be a full grid of prototypes representing many manufacturers. To date, the table of the technical working groups has been around 15 manufacturers. You have an opportunity to have an historic battle at the front. “If you have 15 manufacturers at the table and you got even 50 percent of that kind of participation? Think about that happening. That makes the hair on my arms stand up. It’s positive. Very positive.” With the LMDh class, manufacturers will be able to use the elements currently employed in the DPi class that relate to their production vehicles, like engines and styling cues, and apply it to a class that would showcase a hybrid engine. “That puts us into a league that further emulates road-car relevant technology,” Doonan said. The buzz surrounding the LMDh switch in 2023 comes as IMSA gears up for next month’s Rolex 24 At Daytona and the kick-off of the 2021 WeatherTech Championship. A stacked DPi class field is expected, along with an impressive field of LMP2 cars and the introduction of the LMP3 class into the WeatherTech Championship. There should be no shortage of prototype action the next two years. For now, though, the talk is about 2023 and beyond. “Somebody always has to be first, and to have this become official last night by Porsche and Audi’s comments last week and knowing that there are all these others at the table gives us tremendous optimism and tremendous momentum,” Doonan said. “After a few step up and make these announcements, others tend to follow.” The Roar Before the Rolex 24 is scheduled for Jan. 22-24, with the season-opening Rolex 24 At Daytona set for Jan. 27-31.

 The list of Official Automotive Partners in IMSA grew to an impressive 18 today with confirmation that Toyota will compete in the 2021 IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge season. Selected customers will race the Toyota GR Supra GT4 across the 10-event schedule in the first of a multiyear partnership between the manufacturer and IMSA. The announcement marks the return of the Toyota brand to IMSA competition. Toyota totaled 53 race victories in the past – 51 coming in IMSA GT competition and two in the American Le Mans Series, including the overall triumph at the 2013 Motul Petit Le Mans. “While this new program marks Toyota’s first foray into the IMSA Michelin Pilot Challenge, Toyota’s IMSA history is stellar,” said IMSA President John Doonan. “The GR Supra GT4 program begins a new chapter, but if history is our guide, all the ingredients are in place for tremendous success. We’re delighted to welcome Toyota back to IMSA competition and into one of the most competitive classes of sports car racing anywhere in the world.” The GR Supra GT4 to be used in Pilot Challenge competition is based on the GR Supra, Toyota Gazoo Racing's first global model from the Toyota Gazoo Racing Customer Racing Program. Developed and produced by Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe GmbH (TGR-E), the GR Supra GT4 has an in-line six-cylinder, 430-horsepower engine that includes a seven-speed sports automatic transmission with paddle shift. It has a high-strength roll cage on a lightweight steel body. The interior features a carbon fiber instrumental panel with a display and steering wheel specifically designed for GT4 competition globally. Toyota Racing Development (TRD) U.S.A., Inc., will support Supra GT4 customers at all Pilot Challenge races with a systems engineer and spares truck. TRD announced in September the sale of the first customer GR Supra GT4 to Toyota Gazoo Racing (TGR)-Latin America. Riley Motorsports, a mainstay in both the Pilot Challenge and IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, will field the car in 2021 Pilot Challenge competition. “We are thrilled to partner together with IMSA, racing in the Michelin Pilot Series with the GR Supra GT4,” said Tyler Gibbs, general manager, TRD U.S.A., Inc. “Toyota has a storied history in the series, and we look forward to a successful return to American sports car competition as the GR Supra GT4 hits the track at Daytona next month.” Bill Riley, team principal of Riley Motorsports – the family-owned operation that has designed and built 13 winning cars at the Rolex 24 At Daytona – is thrilled over the new alignment with Toyota. “We are really excited to be part of the new GR Supra GT4 racing program in IMSA next season,” Riley said. “It looks competitive right out of the box, and I know it won’t disappoint.” Most Pilot Challenge races are two hours in length, but the 2021 season opens with the BMW Endurance Challenge At Daytona, a four-hour event on Friday, Jan. 29 at Daytona International Speedway. Teams will have the opportunity to test at the Roar Before the Rolex 24 from Jan. 22-24.

Tisdale's first concern, of course, will be the health of his players and staff after the COVID outbreak, but he will also use this unanticipated break to take stock and plan for the rest of the campaign.
 He has had very little training time at The Quarters since taking charge four weeks ago, playing three games every seven days.
 And that Saturday-Tuesday rhythm is not going to relent often for the rest of the season, particularly if Rovers continue their cup runs.
 The sheer number of games awaiting the Gas places huge importance on Tisdale accelerating his learning about his squad and planning some form of rotation policy which ensures Rovers’ new-found performance levels are not decreased while the fitness of the players is protected.

1. Don’t just focus on your strengths, cater to your weaknesses. The main thing that kept me from starting my own company was I am NOT a money person. I always assumed that to have a business, one must be a “business person.” Turns out, you can hire those folks. It took me a while to save up the capital to hire a lawyer and accountant, but once I did, I was able to move forward and get my business up and running.                                             2. Make cheat sheets. Once again, I do not have a money brain, and I do not have the funds to hire a fulltime bookkeeper, so I got software. It is super-helpful, but it’s also pretty technical. I have found it helpful to take snapshots of the correct process within the program. If I don’t use something on a daily basis, the knowledge is fleeting.                                             3. Make checklists. When you run a business, you get pulled in many different directions. Before you open up your computer each day, make a list, on paper, of the things you intend to accomplish that day. Once the computer is booted up you are down the rabbit hole …                                             4. Be prepared to abandon your list. Lists are great for technical/business things you need to do, but they are pretty useless for creativity. If your day takes you in a different direction from your list, go with it.                                             5. Don’t sell yourself short. This is a biggie for most creative people. We tend to undervalue our abilities because we love what we do. If you have to, factor in the hard costs you have invested in that give you your abilities (education, supplies, hardware, software, etc.). This may be a joy for you, but it’s an enigma for others, own that. You have no problem paying a plumber or electrician what they ask, why should you question your rate? You are providing a valuable service.

HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The Stadium Authority’s announcement to indefinitely shut down Aloha Stadium has left the Rainbow Warriors temporarily homeless for the first time in over four decades.The team held the stadium’s first sporting event back in 1975, but now with its future in jeopardy some former Warriors reflected on their time at the venue.Former defensive lineman Zeno Choi remembers fondly of his first time wearing the “H” on his helmet, signifying a big step in his football career.“To play a few games in high school, then transitioning to a bigger platform playing at the college level is huge.” Choi told Hawaii News Now. “It means the world, not only for me, but to other individuals as well, other players, athletes and what not.”Choi went on to say that his favorite memory at Aloha Stadium was the ‘Bows 2019 Hawaii Bowl victory over BYU, a sentiment shared by his former teammate Dayton Furuta.“It has to be that win over BYU last year in the Hawaii Bowl.” Furuta said. “BYU is always a big game and just the way our team came together and was able to pull that off.”Many more memories come to mind for the local boys, who grew up in the shadow of the “Metal Mecca” long before they were playing for the home team.Former UH pass rusher Kaimana Padello remembers his first time at the stadium — like Furuta and Choi — a Pop Warner Championship game. Padello can still remember the feeling of being in the locker room that afternoon.“Playing in the stadium, it’s always a great experience, just going into the locker room, seeing where all of these guys suit up, knowing that even NFL players go there for the Pro Bowl.” Padello said. “It’s just a lot of memories for sure.”Looking ahead, UH Athletic Director David Matlin confirmed that the ‘Bows are now in the process of finding a new home for the 2021 season.In a statement, Matlin says that “we must now take responsibility ourselves to find a suitable venue for our Rainbow Warriors, Hawaiʻi’s football team, to play in front of our loyal fans beginning in 2021.”A couple of possibilities have already started to circulate, one being the possibility of moving to War Memorial Stadium in Maui, the only other site in the state large enough for a Division I football program.Back in 2013, Furuta took a trip to War Memorial as part of the Mililani Trojans football team, reflecting on island hopping for football.“It was a great experience, especially being in high school, it felt almost like a (Mainland) game for us, but just being in Maui.” Furuta said. “Maui’s a beautiful place and the stadium is awesome, but from what I can remember it is a little windy.”Another option would have UH play on the road the whole season, something Padello thinks will have an adverse affect on the players.“It’s going to be challenging definitely, it’s going to be very taxing on the body having to fly every single week.” Padello said. “Normally they would fly out on a Wednesday or a Thursday, so to constantly put your body on a plane over and over again, I mean it’s going to wear you down definitely.”As of now, there is no official plan for where the Rainbow Warriors will call home in 2021.Copyright 2020 Hawaii News Now.

If the Colts would not have folded the fourth quarter the Jaguars would have the first pick in the 2021 NFL Draft. They would lose the tiebreaker between them and the Jets on strength of schedule.
 The 0-13 New York Jets are not the worst team in the NFL.
 The 1-12 Jacksonville Jaguars are the worst team in football.
 This is a debate that will go on for the rest of the season but if we look at the two on paper, the Jaguars lose.

ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Mary Wilson is taken aback by how many people have begun noticing the clutch, emblazoned with the Bills' charging buffalo logo, she carries while running errands from her winter home in Florida. “I’m not trying to advertise or anything, but it’s like `Oh, you’re a Bills fan. Your team’s doing so great,‘” she told The Associated Press by phone. “I’m so popular now because I’m a Bills fan.” Some might not realize how Wilson’s connections to the Bills go far deeper. She’s the widow of the team’s late owner and team founder, Pro Football Hall of Famer Ralph Wilson, and served as the franchise’s controlling owner following his death in March 2014 before the Bills were sold to Terry and Kim Pegula for a then-NFL-record $1.4 billion later that year. Describing herself as “just a fan” now, Mary Wilson can imagine what Ralph might make of the Bills closing in on their first AFC East title in 25 years. “He would be over the moon. He would be having so much fun,” she said. At 10-3, the Bills are in position to clinch the division and third playoff berth in four years by simply beating Denver (5-8) on Saturday. The franchise’s run of newfound success coincides with the arrival of coach Sean McDermott and GM Brandon Beane in 2017, and followed what was the Bills' bleakest era. Buffalo went 17 years without a playoff appearance, which stood as the longest active drought in North America’s four major professional sports. The Bills’ return to relevance gives rise to reflection from those who were part of the franchise’s heyday in the late 1980s and 1990s, during which Buffalo made — and lost — four consecutive Super Bowl appearances. “Way too long? Hah, 25 years? I would say it’s waaaaay, way, way past...

Andersen Promotions today announced that the Chris Griffis Memorial Open Test will return to the iconic Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2021. A fixture on the Road to Indy Presented by Cooper Tires calendar, the 10th annual event is scheduled for October 30-31 on the 2.439-mile, 14-turn IMS road course. Named in memory of Chris Griffis, the former team manager of Schmidt Peterson Motorsports who passed away suddenly in September 2011, the cornerstone of the Chris Griffis Memorial Open Test is to provide new drivers with the opportunity to sample the Road to Indy while offering returning drivers the chance to hone their programs for the following year. More than ever the 2021 test will provide several drivers with the opportunity to experience the next rungs on the highly acclaimed driver development program as part of the 2020 and 2021 series prize packages. Indy Lights, which spent 2020 on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, returns with a stronger-than-ever champion’s scholarship award of $1,289,425 to guarantee entry into at least three NTT INDYCAR SERIES events for 2022 including the Indianapolis 500. As an additional performance incentive, three NTT INDYCAR SERIES teams will provide each of the top-three finishers their first taste of an NTT INDYCAR SERIES car. That one-day NTT INDYCAR SERIES test outing is scheduled for October 29, the day prior to the Chris Griffis Memorial Open Test. “The ‘scouting combine’ experience, similar to other sports, will be an incredible opportunity for their great work and achievement from the 2021 season,” INDYCAR President Jay Frye said. “From the engineer meetings to the test session on the track to the team debrief afterwards, it’ll run the gamut. A ‘let’s see where you are’ type of test with NTT INDYCAR SERIES teams participating and observing.” As announced in June of this year with the likelihood of a Chris Griffis Memorial Test not feasible in 2020, the reigning champions in the Indy Pro 2000 Championship Presented by Cooper Tires and the Cooper Tires USF2000 Championship – Sting Ray Robb and Christian Rasmussen, respectively – will be provided with next level tests at the conclusion of their 2021 campaigns. Robb will be awarded an NTT INDYCAR SERIES test and Rasmussen an Indy Lights test to be held during the three-day event. The value of the champions’ scholarships for Indy Pro 2000 and USF2000 have also increased to $718,065 and $401,305 respectively, guaranteeing the 2021 champions advancement to the next step on the ladder. The prize package will now also include an Indy Lights one-day test provided by the series for the Indy Pro 2000 champion and a one- day test for the USF2000 champion in Indy Pro 2000. “As competitors continue to evaluate their plans for next season, we want to emphasize our commitment to assisting drivers in climbing our Road to Indy ladder to reach the NTT INDYCAR SERIES,” said Dan Andersen, Owner and CEO of Andersen Promotions. “We are extremely excited to work with INDYCAR to offer our top-three Indy Lights drivers an opportunity to test an Indy car, and to offer our reigning champions and 2021 champions in the junior series a chance to take the next step in their careers. “The Chris Griffis test has always been one of my favorites. While it is exciting to see the new talent coming into our paddock, it is also especially rewarding to watch our current drivers move up and to hear their comments after first outings in the next level car. “I also want to thank the Speedway for working with us to accommodate this event in a very busy month of October for them.”

And when you're playing _that_ character, how the hell do you unwind? Mikkelsen compares his process to a valve. "You can get the air out of the balloon somewhere," he says. "For us actors, we get to do crazy stuff in our job, and then we don't have to do crazy stuff in our lives. Because it's kind of off our shoulders after that."
 While such an important part of _Hannibal_ comes in the relationship between its two leads--and don't worry, he says he still keeps close tabs on what Mr. Dancy is up to ("We keep track of each other," he says, noting that the two often try to link up in New York or London. "We'll keep track on email or text messages once in a while just making sure I can figure out how big his family is now, how many dogs they have.")--it's important to know that they also like to break some of that unmistakable dramatic tension with a laugh, whether that's at something minor that went wrong, or, sometimes, for no good reason at all.
 "You have to be able to easily jump into the character, but even more importantly it should be equally easy for you to leave your character," he says.

Donna Marshall, Executive Director of the Midcoast Senior College along with the Board of Directors of the organization, had to reimagine MSC’s mode of delivery in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Every course had to be held remotely until circumstances permitted in-person classes. “We knew we had to keep providing educational options to meet the needs of seniors with curious minds,” she explains. They decided to offer eight weeks of remote learning courses in the fall. Enrollment remained strong, in spite of the change in the mode of delivery. Midcoast Senior College offered 26 courses this fall, representing 561 student sign-ups. (Many students took more than one course.)
