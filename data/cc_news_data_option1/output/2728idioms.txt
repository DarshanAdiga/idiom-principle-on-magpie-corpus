 BEIJING, July 12 (Reuters) - A Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party was released on Sunday after six days of detention, his friends said.
 Xu Zhangrun, a constitutional law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, returned home on Sunday morning but remained under surveillance and was not free to speak publicly about what happened, one of his friends, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
 Calls to the media departments of the Beijing police and Tsinghua University seeking comment went unanswered on Sunday.
 Xu, 57, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two- term limit for China's leader, which will allow Xi to remain in office beyond his current second term.
 According to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters, he was taken from his house in suburban Beijing on Monday morning by more than 20 policemen, who searched his house and confiscated his computer.
 According to Xu's friends, police told his wife that he was being detained for allegedly soliciting prostitution during a trip to Chengdu, but at least two friends dismissed that allegation as character assassination.
 Since the 2018 article, Xu has written other critiques of the party. At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, he wrote an article calling for freedom of speech.
 Most recently in May, before China's delayed annual parliamentary meeting, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China.
 Under Xi, China has clamped down on dissent and tightened censorship.
 U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Tuesday the United States was deeply concerned about China's detention of Xu and urged Beijing to release him. (Reporting by Yew Lun Tian; Editing by Tony Munroe and William Mallard)

And that eventuality had already been planned for by the time the proposed transfer was announced in October. Then, EnergySolutions revealed plans to contract decommissioning work out to New Jersey-based construction company Jingoli, which has had past success with nuclear projects in the United States and Canada.
 Despite a track record, state Department of Environmental Protection officials warned that planning for and beginning decommissioning work too early could put the island and surrounding areas at risk.
 After all, DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell noted, Unit 2 is the site of the worst commercial nuclear accident in United States history — an accident that released radioactive gases and grossly contaminated the reactor and its surrounding buildings.
 “Because of this, we understand there are very high radiation areas within TMI Unit 2 that present a grave risk to personnel that enter,” a letter signed by McDonnell reads.
 That high radiation has prevented all but minor exploration of the Unit 2 area, meaning the radiological conditions inside large portions of the plant remain a mystery, according to the letter.

Si ripromise di parlarne con il suo Bartolo, ma poi ci ripensava e non raccontava  nulla. – Perché darci pensieri a stu cristianu!- Si diceva! E rimandava sempre. La vita di coppia continuava a  procedere serenamente. Mancava solo ‘ncaruseddu e u picciriddu, all’annu appuntu, arrivò. Giuseppina, appena  sicura della sua nuova condizione,  non vide l’ora di correre a dare la notizia a Bartolo. Apri’ la finestra. Entrò un refolo di vento agghiacciante. Era un vento da nord che pareva annunciare una tempesta. Il mare in collera. Il vento aveva raddoppiato la sua forza. Nel cielo  un lampo lo aveva squarciato in due. I pescatori rientravano tutti, uno ad uno. Qualcuno diceva che una buriana così non si era mai vista. Giuseppina faceva come na pazza. Avanti e narreri. A vaccuzza di Bartolo nun si vireva. La sera avanzava, buia e cupa, e il cielo nero e la pioggia e il vento. Lampi che falciavano i visi come lame taglienti, tuoni. Bartoloooo, Bartolooo. Nenti. Giuseppina piangeva e urlava e a sentirla era uno strazio, una pena indicibile, mentre le bianche onde schiumose  impennavano e ingoiavano ogni cosa senza ritegno, senza distinzione. Mastru Petru, la prese per le spalle e ci rissi: - Vattinni, vattinni  a casa! E lei capi’. Impazziu. Dispirata com’era,  andò verso il suo Bartolo, miseramente, inghiottita e ingoiata dal turbinoso. Fu un attimo e Giuseppina fu risucchiata in un mare famelico, in un mare bramoso.

Grace Baptist Church in Kent will host a wheelchair collection drive on Saturday, Aug. 1.  
 Wheelchairs in any condition as well as walkers and canes will be accepted for the Wheels for the World ministry of Joni and Friends.  
 Donations may be brought to the main parking lot of the church, 5915 Rhodes Road, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Questions about the collection may be directed to the website, www.graceinkent.org, the church office at 330-678-9019, or 330-968-9337.  
 Joni and Friends is the international, faith-based ministry of Joni Eareckson Tada. Joni became a quadriplegic in a diving accident as a teenager and has used her disability as an opportunity to help others.  
 Joni and Friends reaches out to people affected by disability in the United States and 14 other countries. Paul and Pat Welch, retired Portage County educators, serve as ministry associates with Joni and Friends and hope this year's wheelchair drive in Northeastern Ohio will be as successful as past efforts.  
 "Nations like El Salvador have a tremendous need for used chairs," explained Paul. "These donations make a huge difference in someone's quality of life."  
 Donations received at Grace Baptist on Aug. 1 will be taken to a triage center in Northeastern Ohio for assessment of their condition. From there, they are transported to various prisons in the U.S. to be refurbished and ultimately shipped around the world to a Wheels for the World outreach event.  
 A team of physical therapists travels with the chairs to these distribution events so each one can be fitted properly to the person receiving it.  
 Since 1994, the Wheels for the World arm of Joni and Friends has been providing a free wheelchair, along with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, to children and adults affected by disability.

See here for the background. I agree that the addition of district criminal court judges to the bail reform lawsuit, for which they will be represented by the Attorney General's office, is a complicating factor, and that it would have been better if Judge Johnson had either ruled or recused himself before that happened. I can't quite articulate what the conflict of interest may be here, but as a matter of general principle it would be best to separate the two cases. Given the reasons why the case was moved in the first place, maybe moving it to Bexar or Fort Bend or some other large-but-not-Collin county is the better way to go; I'd guess no one was advocating such a position, however. As usual, this case gives me a headache, so I'm just going to leave this here and wait till the First Court of Appeals makes its ruling.

Warren Buffett disappointed many investors when he failed to deploy his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate's $137 billion cash pile during the coronavirus crash, but one of his shareholders is still backing him to deliver the goods.
 The famed investor and Berkshire CEO could be "one of the large beneficiaries of this tragedy," Tyler Hardt, whose Pelican Bay Capital Management oversees about $5.4 million in client assets, told Business Insider this week.
 If the pandemic persists or worsens, Buffett can hunt for bargains and put Berkshire's cash to work, he said.
 Moreover, when the virus threat eventually subsides, Berkshire's businesses -- which include See's Candies, Geico, and the Burlington Northern railroad -- will see their profits rebound, he continued.
 "This inevitable recovery is not reflected in the current share price," Hardt added.
 Berkshire's Class B shares have tumbled about 20% this year to trade at $179, giving the company a market capitalization of $443 billion -- a little over three times its cash pile, and less than 1.2 times its net assets.
 Buffett's company is a key holding in Hardt's "concentrated value" portfolio, which returned 19% in the second quarter but is down about 36% this year, according to his second-quarter investor letter.
 Pelican Bay's two other portfolios also made up ground last quarter but remain in the red for the year.

 “I had to take the bus to Plattsburg, New York, after your granddaddy and I married because he was stationed up there. I had never been away from home and here I was, on a bus by myself going all the way to New York. But I knew on the other end of that trip was my husband and that was my life.”
 She paused, catching her thoughts. “And we had a good life — through all of it. Times — situations, events, circumstances — times can and will always change. You can’t let them change you though. The world is always gonna go mad. But you don’t have to be part of the problem.”

"Desde que llegamos de Mexico el dia 20 de junio no salimos de casa, ni siquiera fuimos a visitar a la familia; sin embargo hay personas que nos amenazan y nos tratan como apestados, cuando el virus ya estaba aqui, hubo casos en pueblos de Beariz antes de que nosotros vinieramos de vacaciones y no les dieron la publicidad que nos estan dando a nosotros".
 El matrimonio de emigrantes que, junto con su nieta de 25 años, viajaron desde el pais azteca a su pueblo natal de Beariz en Ourense, estan detras del brote de Covid-19 que se produjo esta semana en una provincia que, tras un mes sin nuevos casos, paso de 1 a 5, cifra que se mantenia ayer. Cuatro de esos casos estan en el mencionado municipio ourensano.
 El matrimonio afectado no quiere mostrar su imagen ni dar sus nombres. "Bastante daño nos estan haciendo ya" , se quejaban ayer, sentados en la terraza del patio delantero de su vivienda, en Muradas, Beariz, donde estan pasando la cuarentena por coronavirus sin haber presentado sintomatologia previa. "Muchos vecinos nos estan condenando sin motivo", dicen.
 Es el sino de un pueblo dividido estos dias sobre si debe haber o no regreso estival al municipio de los emigrantes. Cada verano Beariz suele duplicar la poblacion pasando de los 970 residentes en invierno a mas de 2.000, tras la llegada de la gran familia de emigrantes y descendientes que viven en la diaspora.
 Beariz estaba en la lista de municipios españoles con cero casos de Covid-19, y ya en mayo, desde el centro de salud comenzaron a advertir a los emigrantes que meditaran su regreso al pueblo en verano, desde los paises o ciudades de riesgo en las que viven, y que optaran por pasar su cuarentena alli.
 Pero una patologia no bacteriana de la nieta de 25 años de este matrimonio de emigrantes en Mexico, obligo a operarla esta semana en el Complejo Hospitalario de Ourense, y una vez pasado el protocolo, dio positivo en coronavirus. Tras el rastreo de sus contactos, tambien daban positivo sus abuelos y luego una cuarta persona del pueblo, a la que dicen que "ni conocemos, que no nos culpen tambien de ese contagio".
 Precaucion
 El brote ha cambiado estos dias vida del municipio. "¿Vienen a buscar morbo? No vamos a opinar de nada. Solo decirle que teniamos cero casos hasta ahora y ya esta", protestaba un vecino, mientras se levantaba airado de una de las terrazas de Beariz, prodigo en bares, muchos cerrados aun este verano por escasez de visitantes.
 "No es justo que yo me quede sin ver a mi hijo que igual no viene desde Mexico, o que mi marido que es portugues no haya ido a ver a su familia por precaucion y que algunos emigrantes de vacaciones, paseen por el pueblo sin mascarillas" , explicaba ayer Josefina, otra vecina.
 Flor Valiñas, de El Mexicano de Beariz, que en verano abre a diario para atender a la poblacion foranea con recetas de aquel pais , afirma que "en realidad no se estan saltando nada porque la ley ademas de confusa, desde julio no dice que haya que guardar cuarentena".
 Otro vecino cree que "muchos de los que vienen de otros paises apoyan la teoria de la conspiracion y pasan de tomar medidas de precaucion cuando este es un problema sanitario, no politico" . Con o sin razon Beariz, un ejemplo mas de la envejecida demografia ourensana, pide precaucion por todos pero en especial por sus mayores.

Shekhar Gaikwad, a 2003 batch IAS officer, had a short yet most eventful stint as Pune municipal commissioner chief. The order about Gaikwad's sudden transfer on Saturday raised many eyebrows as it came just at a crucial juncture when Pune will be undergoing a ten-day stricter lockdown, starting Tuesday, after a spike in Covid-19 cases.
 During the meeting called by Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and guardian minister, in the city, on Friday, Gaikwad was among the very few officials who resisted the lockdown. This, according to sources close to him, was an immediate trigger used by other IAS officials for pushing the case of his transfer.
 "I have just got to know about the news. Even I am trying to figure out about the transfer. As a civic chief, I tried to give my best despite limited days," said Gaikwad, immediately after the order was issued by the state government.
 "Decision to transfer Gaikwad is wrong. He has been made scapegoat. I feel the transfer was for political reasons," said Pune MP Girish Bapat.
   
   
 Gaikwad, who shared proximity to Pawar was brought as civic chief from sugar commissioner in January this year had barely any breathing space to get a grip on civic issues as Covid pandemic changed the focus of PMC after the first week of May.
 Before taking charge as the sugar commissioner, Gaikwad had served as commissioner of the groundwater survey and development authority, district collector of Sangli and chief executive officer of Thane zilla parishad.
 During the last leg of lockdown in May, Gaikwad had taken a consistent stand about opening up while offering more relaxations in Pune as compared to other cities. However, as the city's Covid tally began witnessing spike, his stand over more relaxations came under scrutiny especially when the government has brought ten IAS officials to coordinate with him while dealing with the crisis.
 Some of the officials who are more experienced were working under Gaikwad.
 Interestingly, Gaikwad had shifted in the official Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) bungalow just a week ago. However, within seven days, he will have to vacate it after transfer orders.

And they're competing because they're also on a mission to further causes beyond the court. No interest could be more paramount.

Put all of this together, and what we have is a recipe for widening inequities for our most marginalized children. Reopening schools is not going to be an easy task. Infection rates are rising in many states. It is not in a child’s nature to physically distance among friends. Schools will need to be creative and nimble to keep children and staff safe. New school protocols will require additional investment of both monetary and human resources that may not be available.
 That said, at the very least, we must focus on opening schools for our most vulnerable children. They cannot afford another six to 12 months of the current status quo.

 #  The risk teachers face in reopenings
 When I was a young teacher, I joked that the teacher was the third person in the classroom to catch a cold: Two students would catch it, then the teacher, then other students. But it was just a cold. I could joke about it.
 Time would pass, and then two students would catch a cold, and it would happen all over again. Still, it was just a cold.
 COVID-19 isn’t just a cold. If the teacher is the third person in the room to catch the virus, then those students won’t have a teacher in their classroom. What will we do then?

 #  Parents’ role in education at home
 Many a parent complained since mid-March about home schooling their children. Now there is the fear that they will have to continue to home-school this coming school year. It is important to set the record straight on their role. The end of the recent school year saw parents overseeing their children’s education at home. There is a difference between home schooling and education at home.

Other ideas, such as an algae bloom, may have come to mind.​ "The low dissolved oxygen levels, was kind of triggered by that heavy rain event we had last week on Monday," explained District Fisheries Biologist Lynn Wright. "[It] kind of stirred the river up and cause caused the dissolved oxygen levels to go down enough that we lost some fish in the river. In West Texas whenever fish die a lot of people like the jump that idea that it was, it might have been golden algae because we do have golden algae issues that cause fish kills in West Texas.​ However, what happened on the Concho River was purely a natural process, [...] so it wasn't golden algae and it wasn't related to pollution."​​With the most recent rain being lighter, Texas Parks and Wildlife fisheries staff still thought it best to test the waters ahead of an already rescheduled fish stock.​ "That caused me concern that we might see a repeat of what happened.," said Wright. "I did go down to the river [...] to get levels and though they did drop a little bit, they didn't drop as bad as it did last week and so we're still going to be able to stock the river with catfish."​

One of the pinnacles of my window staring has been catching sight of an adult red fox trotting right under the window one morning, returning from its rounds. At night, foxes sometimes pee in the container I leave out with dry catfood, marking it as their own feeding source.
 If I turn in my seat just right, I can see through layers of trees to a corner of a bald eagle nest. I have seen them perched there, ripping off meat from a carcass and leaning over to deliver it to a pair of clamoring eaglets. They have quite the range of vocalizations, I have learned. The high-pitched sound of a siren always sets them off.
 My decision to welcome all wildlife comes at a price. Groundhogs will certainly eat my tomatoes. Deer are already mowing our hostas to the ground, feral cats are catching bird species already in sharp decline.
 For now, though, I’m willing to live and let live for my free inspiration.

Insurance aggregator Policybazaar expects to return to profitability this fiscal on the back of a surge in demand for insurance products amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Growth over the last year is between 70 per cent and 100 per cent depending on the insurance product, Policybazaar.com Group CEO and co-founder Yashish Dahiya told PTI. This year we should be profitable. We were profitable in FY18 while FY19 and FY20 we were not quite profitable. So this growth in business will help us to become profitable from this year onwards, he said. Due to the loss posted by Policybazaar in the last two financial years, fund infusion by investment major SoftBank during the last round came under scrutiny. Dahiya, however, gave a thumbs up to the SoftBank investment team, led by Munish Verma and Sumer Juneja. I dont know about what others have to say, but the SoftBank team has been the most mature and consistent investor we have on our capital table. Munishs first investment was us, then Firstcry, followed by Delhivery and Lenskart. All of them are highly regarded for being capital efficient, he said. He further said the company will look to consolidate its operations, invest in customer service and work towards capital efficiency as it eyes swinging back into profitability this fiscal. Despite booking a loss, the companys revenue jumped three-fold while it doubled both market share and valuation at the end FY20, he added. During 2020-21, Dahiya said the company should log revenues of Rs 1,100 crore and post a marginal profit. On the insurance premium side, he said the current fiscal will close with Rs 6,000 crore as against Rs 4,000 crore in FY20. As far as the other business Paisabazar is concerned, he said there is some stress on that side as demand for loans has come down significantly due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Our local governments are at their best when they operate in a transparent manner under the watchful eye of a citizenry that's informed, engaged and eager to be heard on issues both important and mundane.
   
 One of open government's tallest pillars is the residents' ability to be in the room when those they've elected to represent them decide how to spend their money or alter their town.
   
 That pillar strained like never before this spring under the weight of the coronavirus and the stay-at-home orders, business closures and community and governmental cancellations that followed the outbreak.
   
 And while COVID-19 is a continuing reality in most towns in Bucks and Montgomery counties, local governments are gradually resuming meetings that, by law, must be accessible to the public.
   
 We don't envy the job of local officials. It seems to us like they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. They need to preserve the public's Sunshine Act-guaranteed right to participate in government meetings. But they also need to create the more-restrictive environments that accompany the incorporation of social distancing and other guidelines designed to keep the citizens safe and limit the virus's spread.
   
 Towns have tried to strike that balance through the use of live-streaming technology with call-in, email or text-in forms of public participation. Some have even used web conferencing platforms like Zoom to gather remotely and allow the public join in.
   
 Now we're watching municipalities navigate the public's return to their meeting rooms.
   
 In townships with no controversial issues on the upcoming summer agendas, the change should be minimal. Attendees will generally be required to wear masks, socially distance in the audience (not difficult if only a few residents turn out for meetings) and agree to have their temperatures taken when they arrive.
   
 But towns with hot-button topics and packed meetings will need to be thoughtful about how they're giving the public its access when a COVID-era capacity crowd, in some towns, doesn't exceed single digits.
   
 Here are a few ideas we like. We support the use of overflow rooms where residents can gather in a second room and watch the proceedings.
   
 Some developers arrive at municipal meetings accompanied by attorneys, engineers, landscape architects and other consultants. It makes sense to us that their teams should be required to wait outside until it's their turn to present.
   
 Municipalities should be quick to seek out other venues when meetings are expected to bring substantial crowds. Before the coronavirus, it wasn't unusual to see important meetings moved to a local public school auditorium. We understand that school districts might be less willing to allow outside groups to use their facilities with COVID-19 still spreading. But we urge districts to do what they can to accommodate such requests in the name of good government.
   
 Busier towns with a reliable contingent of meeting attendees should also consider using sign-up sheets and establishing a rotation of audience members.
   
 The towns should clearly outline all the new meeting protocols on the home pages of their websites to head off confusion and manage residents' expectations.
   
 As for those residents, we'd recommend reviewing the agenda ahead of the meeting. If there are no topics they'd be compelled to weigh in on, they should consider watching the meeting at home, rather than taking a seat away from someone more directly impacted by an agenda item.
   
 Consideration should also be given to elderly and economically disadvantaged residents for whom watching a live-streamed supervisors meeting from home may prove difficult.
   
 We also urge members of the public to be considerate of others' personal space and wear their masks without argument.
   
 Township staff, elected officials and residents all have a role to play in making these meetings work. If all parties approach the matter with understanding, flexibility and a willingness to adapt, they can turn their attention to the business of running the town.

Step one is to stop trying to make the person with the responsive desire be more like the person with the spontaneous desire. Responsive desire doesn't mean you have a lower libido. It's just another healthy, normal way to experience desire that requires a different approach to sex than what spontaneous desire folks are used to.
 For the person with the responsive desire, Joy says the main thing to do is to figure out how to access your turn-on (with or without your partner). You don't get turned on spontaneously like your partner does, so what _does_ turn you on?
 "Maybe I feel good about my body when I exercise. Maybe it is not having stupid underwear but having cute underwear. Maybe I need 30 minutes of cuddling before I even start to think about being sexual," Joy says. "Maybe I need my husband to do bedtime with the kids, and I need to take a bubble bath." She also suggests listening to erotic audio stories for women (there are apps for that!) or even watching steamy shows like _Outlander_ before heading to bed. Whatever works for you!
 When you know what turns you on, you can access it whenever you want rather than waiting for sexual desire to spontaneously show up for you—because your body might just not work that way, and that's cool. Different strokes for different folks.

After Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot accused the BJP of trying to topple his government, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday was the first to go public on the crisis saying he was worried for the party. Seeking a quick resolution of the crisis , he asked when would the party leadership wake up . Worried for our party. Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables, he said on Twitter. Sources said a crisis is brewing within the Rajasthan Congress with deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and his supporting MLAs not sharing good ties with Chief Minister Gehlot. The flash point between the two top leaders in Rajasthan was a probe ordered by the state police into poaching of MLAs and a notice sent to Pilot, which has not gone well with him. The Rajasthan police has issued notices to Gehlot and his deputy Pilot to record their statement in connection with the alleged attempts to topple their Congress government, sources said on Saturday. The police's special operations group (SOG) also sent a notice to Government Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi to record his statement, they said. The move came after the SOG on Friday registered an FIR against two people, who have been detained, for their alleged involvement in horse trading of Congress MLAs for toppling the Gehlot government. Gehlot on Saturday accused the opposition BJP of trying to topple his government by offering his legislators large sums of money and said his administration is not just stable but will complete its five-year term. The BJP had asked Gehlot to prove his allegation of horse-trading levelled against it or quit politics, and claimed he was targeting the opposition party as he was unable the check the infighting in the state Congress.

Shannon Gabriel took five wickets as West Indies were set a target of exactly 200 runs to win the first Test against England at Southampton on Sunday's fifth day.
 England were bowled out for 313 in their second innings, with fast bowler Gabriel taking 5-75 in 21.2 overs -- his sixth five-wicket haul in 46 Tests.
 The hosts resumed on their overnight 284-8, with all their specialist batsmen dismissed.
 Gabriel had tailender Mark Wood edging a cut to wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich on two to leave England 303-9 in good batting conditions beneath sunny blue skies.
 Barbados-born fast bowler Jofra Archer drove Gabriel down the ground for four in spectacular style to extend England's lead to 199 runs.
 But next ball Archer was out for 23, caught behind after gloving a hook off Gabriel.
 England, chasing the game for most of this match, had been recovering well during a fourth-wicket stand of 98 between Zak Crawley, whose 76 was his highest Test score, and stand-in skipper Ben Stokes on Saturday.
 But when Stokes, captaining England in the absence of Joe Root, fell to opposing skipper Jason Holder for 48 -- the second time in the match he had been dismissed by his rival all-rounder -- it sparked a collapse that saw five wickets lost for 30 runs.
 This opening match in a three-Test behind closed doors series marks the return of international cricket from the coronavirus lockdown.

 With June’s rush of sweaty work — wheat harvest, straw baling, laying corn by, cultivating soybeans, and weed spraying — finally complete and before another cutting of alfalfa was ready, mid-July slipped in with treats like fresh peaches, sweet corn, and juicy garden tomatoes.
 Mid-July also meant baseball’s All-Star game, the county fair, and a week’s vacation in Missouri’s far away Lake of the Ozarks where we kids would swim all day, Dad would fish all day, and Mom wouldn’t can a quart of anything any day.
 This year, most fairs have been canceled and baseball and vacations have either been dramatically altered or simply cashiered because of COVID. In a way, most of this summer’s fun has been canceled for countless Americans by, well, themselves in a personal effort to stay healthy.

The federal government put $40 million on the table in April for genetic research on COVID-19. Half is to keep tabs on the virus as it spreads, look for any changes it undergoes, and map its pathway across the country. The other half is to look at the genetic structures of the patients who get infected, trying to answer the puzzling question of why some people die and others have symptoms so mild they never even know they are sick.

 Our local governments are at their best when they operate in a transparent manner under the watchful eye of a citizenry that's informed, engaged and eager to be heard on issues both important and mundane.
 One of open government's tallest pillars is the residents' ability to be in the room when those they've elected to represent them decide how to spend their money or alter their town.
 That pillar strained like never before this spring under the weight of the coronavirus and the stay-at-home orders, business closures and community and governmental cancellations that followed the outbreak.
 And while COVID-19 is a continuing reality in most towns in Bucks and Montgomery counties, local governments are gradually resuming meetings that, by law, must be accessible to the public.
 We don't envy the job of local officials. It seems to us like they're stuck between a rock and a hard place. They need to preserve the public's Sunshine Act-guaranteed right to participate in government meetings. But they also need to create the more-restrictive environments that accompany the incorporation of social distancing and other guidelines designed to keep the citizens safe and limit the virus's spread.
 Towns have tried to strike that balance through the use of live-streaming technology with call-in, email or text-in forms of public participation. Some have even used web conferencing platforms like Zoom to gather remotely and allow the public join in.
 Now we're watching municipalities navigate the public's return to their meeting rooms.
 In townships with no controversial issues on the upcoming summer agendas, the change should be minimal. Attendees will generally be required to wear masks, socially distance in the audience (not difficult if only a few residents turn out for meetings) and agree to have their temperatures taken when they arrive.
 But towns with hot-button topics and packed meetings will need to be thoughtful about how they're giving the public its access when a COVID-era capacity crowd, in some towns, doesn't exceed single digits.
 Here are a few ideas we like. We support the use of overflow rooms where residents can gather in a second room and watch the proceedings.
 Some developers arrive at municipal meetings accompanied by attorneys, engineers, landscape architects and other consultants. It makes sense to us that their teams should be required to wait outside until it's their turn to present.
 Municipalities should be quick to seek out other venues when meetings are expected to bring substantial crowds. Before the coronavirus, it wasn't unusual to see important meetings moved to a local public school auditorium. We understand that school districts might be less willing to allow outside groups to use their facilities with COVID-19 still spreading. But we urge districts to do what they can to accommodate such requests in the name of good government.
 Busier towns with a reliable contingent of meeting attendees should also consider using sign-up sheets and establishing a rotation of audience members.
 The towns should clearly outline all the new meeting protocols on the home pages of their websites to head off confusion and manage residents' expectations.
 As for those residents, we'd recommend reviewing the agenda ahead of the meeting. If there are no topics they'd be compelled to weigh in on, they should consider watching the meeting at home, rather than taking a seat away from someone more directly impacted by an agenda item.
 Consideration should also be given to elderly and economically disadvantaged residents for whom watching a live-streamed supervisors meeting from home may prove difficult.
 We also urge members of the public to be considerate of others' personal space and wear their masks without argument.
 Township staff, elected officials and residents all have a role to play in making these meetings work. If all parties approach the matter with understanding, flexibility and a willingness to adapt, they can turn their attention to the business of running the town.

Small businesses and corporations are not the only ones who have seen an economic hit because of COVID-19. The tourism industry in North Carolina has seen a sharp decline in visitor spending and overnight hotel stays since the pandemic hit.
   
 Governor Roy Cooper's COVID-19 executive order restricts the number of people in a group and recommends people not to travel outside the community unless necessary.
   
 According to a press release by the American Hotel & Lodging Association, state and local revenues from hotels for 2020 will drop by $68.8 billion due to COVID-19. For North Carolina, the estimated losses will be $289.2 million in state and local revenues, $241.6 million in lodging taxes and $16.87 million in personal income.
   
 Robin Bivens, director of the Lexington Tourism Authority, said the hotel occupancy rate in Davidson County has dropped approximately 25 percent in May, and is expected to continue to drop through the summer. Local tourism companies get a majority of their annual revenue from hotel occupancy and local sales tax.
   
 Bivens said the situation is especially disappointing because visitor spending was expected to increase this year.
   
 "This is a new day and it is a little bit challenging, but we are doing what we can," Bivens said. "We had expected a 30 percent increase (in revenue) if COVID had not hit. We were expecting 2020 to be a really great year, then it just hit us. Where we will really start seeing the difference is in May and June because we think of the summer season as the event season."
   
 Bivens said the cancellation of local events, such as concerts at the Breeden Insurance Amphitheater, due to COVID-19 have also affected local businesses. She said many of the coronavirus restrictions make planning events practically impossible.
   
 "The businesses uptown don't rely only on visitors, but they anticipate an increase in business when there are events that bring people into uptown," Bivens said. "We had something planned for fall, but we put that on hold until next spring. … When the governor mandates no groups outside more than 25, it is not the right time to be planning large events."
   
 She said local hotels in Davidson County have been able to maintain some occupancy thanks to teams of contractors working on local projects, such as EGGER and the Davidson County Courthouse project.
   
 In Randolph County, hotel occupancy has bottomed out but is beginning a slight upswing, according to Amber Scarlett of the Randolph County Tourism Development Authority. Her report reflects the decrease in travel during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 She gave the hotel report at a recent meeting of the Randolph County Tourism Development Authority Board of Directors.
   
 "The TDA staff continues a daily phone call schedule to all properties and see occupancy numbers remain steady with a slight uptick," Scarlett said.
   
 Among hotels in Randolph County, the revenue per available room for May 2020 was $24.61, a drop of 57.4 percent from the $57.77 of May 2019. The average daily rate for this May was $68.10, down 24.7 percent from last year's $90.45. Occupancy for this May posted at 36.1 percent compared to last May's 63.9 percent, a decrease of 43.5 percent
   
 Alamance County has also seen a sharp decline in occupancy tax revenue with the county's modest tourism sector hit hard by COVID-19 restrictions and fears. Hotels had 10 to 20 percent fewer guests, according to Grace VandeVisser, executive director of the Alamance County Visitors Bureau.
   
 The county budget occupancy tax estimates have been cut in half to $456,500. The county had been seeing steady growth in tourism dollars in the past few years with the Haw River Trail and Cedarock Park drawing the most visitors.
   
 Bivens said just as in the months after the "economic recession" in 2008, tourism will return eventually. She said it will just take a little time for people to become confident that it is safe to travel.
   
 "The board and I feel like visitors will return, but it will be regional at first," Bivens said. "People have to get comfortable traveling, first statewide and then crossing to other states. You have to think, it is one thing when you have a slump in one area, we are experiencing this worldwide. We are all working together trying to figure it out."

By Tony Mushoborozi
 Sometime in early November 1987, two State operatives entered Mitchell Hall at Makerere University on a mission to pick up a 24-year-old student they suspected of keeping an impressive stash of guns in his dorm room. They didn’t find the guns but they took him away anyway.   The young man in question was not a student leader, nor was he an activist. He was a regular student of Library and Information Science whose only crime, as it turned out, was his linguistic identity and the fact that he was a member of the Uganda Peoples Congress (UPC). The student’s name was Joseph Pinytek Ochieno.
 The details of the torture he underwent in custody over the next several days are, by his sad reminiscence, rather too painful for these pages. Fortunately, Ochieno escaped from his captors a few days into the torture and commenced plans to seek refuge elsewhere.
 On November 22, 1987, with bated breath, Ochieno slumped down into his seat on a Uganda Airlines flight and fastened his seatbelt. The clock was ticking. All he had to do was pretend to be calm or asleep for the next 15 minutes as he waited for take-off. He dreaded the possibility of being carried off the plane at the very cusp of his freedom. He had survived seven roadblocks on the way to the airport, but it was not over until he was in the air. Every bit of his mortal being was praying.   Take-off came and went. Ten minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes. Thirty minutes past take-off time and the plane was still seated like mother hen. The hunger, the aches and bruises from several days of torture faded in comparison to the pain of that delay.
 Finally, the reason for the delay was resolved by the arrival of one of the senior NRA officers. Hundreds of passengers were furious to learn that he was the sole reason they had lost almost an hour of their time.   The officer recognised Ochieno immediately and proceeded to demand his removal. But as expected, the furious passengers were in no mood to play along. They would not suffer another minute of waiting, which is exactly what the arrest of the young man would have caused. It was one man against an entire cabin of angry passengers. They told him off and saved the life of the asylum seeker, albeit inadvertently.   “I sought asylum on arrival. I was in another world, traumatised, beaten and bruised, but, ironically – free – in exile. My close family members never got to know the details or the timing of my exit. I wept for my siblings, but more particularly I wept for my father,” Ochieno says.
 Activism   Thirty three years later, Ochieno is still in London. He is one of the foremost commentators on African matters for the broadcasting giants of the world. His name is on speed dial at CNN, BBC, CGTN, Al Jazeera, Sky News and such other global television news channels. He’s commented on the continent’s big stories dating back to the late 1990s. Yet activism, not a course in journalism, brought him to that place.   “When I arrived in the UK, I never settled. I joined Ugandans to campaign to expose the atrocities and excesses of the NRA, especially in the north at the time, and eventually Rwanda and DR Congo,” Ochieno says.
 Ochieno juggled his activism with his university education. He had joined the University of East London for a BA (Business Studies) on arrival and later returned to the same university to do a MA in Refugee Studies.   Ochieno would later participate in anti-apartheid campaigns in London and for the release of Nelson Mandela. He would participate in activism against land- ownership problems in Zimbabwe and several other causes on the continent. All this meant that he would have to immerse himself in the complex dynamics surrounding these continental issues on a daily basis. And as such, the activist metamorphosed into a journalist.

A deadly explosion in a Tehran clinic last month was caused by staff negligence, Tehran's deputy police chief said, ruling out sabotage.
 A police investigation has concluded that the explosion and fire that killed 19 people in the Iranian capital on July 30 was "by no means a security issue," Hamid Hadavand was cited as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. About a dozen people, most of them clinic staffers, were arrested and released on bail until trial, he said, in the first official conclusion on the cause of the blast.
 The clinic blast was one in a string of mysterious explosions, including at a military site near Tehran and a nuclear enrichment facility, to have rocked Iran in recent weeks, giving rise to suspicions of sabotage.
