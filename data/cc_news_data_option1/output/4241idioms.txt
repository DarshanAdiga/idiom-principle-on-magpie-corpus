In networking, our job is connecting things (people, smartphones, servers, sensors …), and that is still a necessary and desired service. Increasingly, however, we are connecting people to this new thing (relative to the PSTN) called a social network, whose irresponsible behavior has already had negative repercussions in the society at large. While companies like Google and Facebook may have launched with the most noble of intentions, their business strategy of collecting and using (maybe “weaponizing”) peoples’ web queries to sell more targeted content in a totally unregulated environment has contributed to a true social crisis.                                                                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

She said the family could not even fulfill Chris’ last wish, which was to be an organ donor, because his body was so badly damaged in the accident.
 “He would help anyone with car or home repairs, or anything he could,” Donna continued. “He gave his spare tire to a poor man who was broken down and didn’t have a spare.
 “His son now will have to grow up with no dad,” she said. “He will never be able to teach his son to hunt or fish or take him to his first day of school. He will never know the joy of being a grandparent.
 “It’s 10 months later and I still cry daily. You, you will go away for awhile, but when you come back you’ll be able to see your family and participate in their lives. Chris will never be able to do that.
 “He will never be able to give me a hug again and tell me he loves me,” she added tearfully.
 “There is no denying it’s a tragedy when a life is lost,” Kawula’s attorney James Marek told the court. “But I think we have to take a look at what Nick has done since the accident. He has enrolled in counseling to learn the best way how to navigate his life now and the punishment he knows he has coming.
 “He has no priors before this and has been a productive member of society,” Marek continued. “He had a wife and two children.”
 Marek said he had not seen in the pre-sentence investigation that Kawula had slept for three to four hours after the party that night and thought that would be enough sleep to be able to drive home.
 “Whether he was drunk and tired or just tired we don’t know,” Marek said, “but he fell asleep at the wheel.”
 Marek went on to ask the judge to give Kawula jail time instead of prison time.
 “Mr. Kawula is not prepared for what lies ahead of him,” Marek said. “He has no idea the type of things that go on in prison.”
 Judge Sniegowski pointed out the fact that Kawula’s blood alcohol content was .10 more than two hours after the accident.
 “Dec. 14 when I decided to drive home I had no idea the changes that were about to come into my life and the lives of other people,” Kawula said when it was his time to address the court.
 Kawula said he battled depression and that following the accident he was distraught and in shock, trying to come to grip with what had happened.
 “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry to everyone that I have hurt,” Kawula said. “I’m sorry for the pain that I have caused everyone.”
 “Most days I wish that it had been me that died in that crash instead of Chris.”

As Bihar gears up to vote in Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday got its Delhi MP and Bhojpuri singer Manoj Tiwari to reprise one of his chartbusters, appealing to voters to retain their trust in the state's ruling dispensation.                          "Suna ho Bihar ke bhaiya", launched by the party as its new election song, is a straight lift off "Jiya ho Bihar ke lala" - the foot-tapping number from Manoj Bajpayee-starrer Gangs of Wasseypur, which had acquired a cult status upon its release a decade ago.                          Incidentally, the composer of the original song, Sneha Khanwalkar, had been roped in by the campaign team of chief minister Nitish Kumar in the 2015 assembly polls when she came out with the catchy "Phir se Nitish Kumar Ho".                          The JD(U) chief had then comfortably returned to power belying naysayers who were skeptical about his coalition with archrival Lalu Prasad's Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) finding resonance with the voters.                                                                                                            Back in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Kumar is now the coalition's chief ministerial candidate, and in the new song, Tiwari, who has retained the tune as well as the background score of the original number, reminds the voters that he wants them to support the JD(U) chief even as the larger than life persona of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his benevolence towards Bihar seems to be the central theme of the song.                          In the nearly eight-minute-long song, Tiwari dwells at length on the progress made by the state under the NDA rule.                          He then goes on to add that if someone says in spite of so many accomplishments "Bihar mein ka ba (what does Bihar have to offer)" then the person needs to get eyeglasses checked.                          For the politically aware people of Bihar, the insinuation is hard to miss.                          Neha Singh Rathore, a bespectacled 20-something from Tiwari's native district Kaimur, has become an internet sensation with her rap song "Bihar mein kaa ba" where she takes a grim, sardonic view of her home state. She claims a lot remains to be done despite a decade-and-a-half of sushasan (good governance).                          Manoj Bajpayee's rap number "Mumbai mein kaa baa", released recently to much acclaim, had inspired Rathore, who keeps a low profile and reaches out to viewers and listeners through songs which she self-records on her smartphone and uploads on social media.                          A self-styled cultural activist who wants to pull Bhojpuri music out of the slush of sleaze, Rathore likes to make a political point without caring much for party affiliations.                          After "Bihar mein ka ba" became a hit on social media platforms earlier this month, the RJD-led opposition, eager to fish in NDA's troubled waters following the rebellion by Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) leader Chirag Paswan, lapped up the song to use it to score brownie points against the ruling coalition.                          Paswan has been bitterly criticising Nitish Kumar over a host of issues including alleged corruption and lack of development.                          The BJP's famed election machinery hit back with a vengeance, coming out with a series of video packages showcasing the NDA government's achievements in the state with the tagline "Bihar mein ee ba (this is what Bihar has to offer)".                          Recently, another upcoming folk singer from Bihar, Maithili Thakur, who croons in her eponymous native language, sought to lampoon the "kaa ba" refrain of Rathore, whom she did not mention by name, and sung paeans to the state's rich cultural heritage.                          It is being speculated that Thakur, with no apparent political inclinations, had been approached by the saffron party. Rathore seems to be taking it all on the chin, though.                          Unfazed by the attacks, she has come out with yet another song that gets close to the bone of NDA backers.                          "Rozgar deba ki karba drama, kursi tohar baap ken na ha (will you do something for job creation or simply indulge in antics. Remember, your seat of power is not dynastic)," says Rathore in the song which she says reflects the mood of the state's youth. It, however, remains to be seen how the new song impacts the electoral outcome.                                          *[FT]: Financial Times

The rupee pared its initial gains and depreciated 9 paise to settle at 73.58 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as heavy selling in domestic equities weighed on investor sentiment.                           At the interbank forex market, the domestic unit witnessed a highly volatile trading session. It opened at 73.39, pared the gains and finally closed at 73.58 against the greenback, registering a decline of 9 paise over its previous close of 73.49.                           During the session, the local unit saw an intra-day high of 73.36 and a low of 73.62 against the American currency.                           "Market sentiments are hinged on to the US fiscal stimulus negotiations.

Gupta further said that "the election event volatility is yet to begin and the USD-INR spot is respecting the strong support of 73. Until it trades above that, prices will remain in between 73-73.60".

"Jens e il maggiore di tre fratelli ed e cresciuto a Bodo, una piccola citta poco piu a nord del circolo artico con 50'000 abitanti. E' stato introdotto al mondo del calcio presto. Gia all'eta di 3 anni, ha incominciato a partecipare ad alcuni allenamenti due volte a settimana in un progetto che avevo creato per l'inclusione di alcuni giovani stranieri. Era bello vedere questo piccolo bambino dai capelli chiari correre tra le gambe dei ragazzi piu grandi. Io ricordo che qualche volta dovevo dire loro di passargli la palla una o due volte, cosi poteva toccare il pallone prima che glielo portassero via di nuovo. Tuttavia, il primo vero interesse di Jens per il calcio e venuto alla luce quando ha incontrato il figlio del calciatore Runar Berg in un parco giochi mentre indossava la maglietta gialla del Bodo Glimt. Era qualcosa di nuovo per lui e che lo aveva attratto a tal punto che abbiamo dovuto comprargli una maglietta uguale. Penso che quello sia stato il preciso momento in cui Jens si e innamorato del calcio.

While the core storyline following Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto and his family of fellow car-enthusiasts-turned-thieves-turned-physics-defying-superheroes will conclude after Lin directs the 11th installment, spin-off movies based on “Fast and Furious” characters are currently in development at Universal.
