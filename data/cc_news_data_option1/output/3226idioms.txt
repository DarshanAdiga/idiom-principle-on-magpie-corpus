Just as our marketing surveys had predicted back in April, the older members of our community were not ready to come back right away, but a new group of fresh faces were at the door every single morning—art lovers who had never visited before. I had a bit of fun with hipster jokes because I was touring with couples and families in their mid-twenties, some with little kids, who were on the run from Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens and desperate for their art fix. At least a hundred of them turned up. One of my favorite couples was Alan and Angela, both in the arts and clued in to the major-league stature of the artists on our wall. We are still the only game in town for major art while the city’s museums and galleries that show some of the international art stars on our walls right now remain dormant, so I was having a ball discussing Sean Scully or Jeffrey Gibson, huge figures on the contemporary art scene, with architects, filmmakers, teachers and marketing executives who left me with a lovely and telling compliment (and I quote two of them verbatim), “If we knew we had a world-class museum like this in our neighborhood, we would move here.”

ALMA -- Alex Burris stood in Alma's field house some years ago following an excruciating playoff loss to Batesville.
   
 The Airedales were two plays away from reaching the state championship game. The Pioneers' 31-28 victory may not rank as the toughest loss in history - the turnover-plagued 13-12 semifinals loss to Monticello in '94 and the 10-7 loss to Harrison in the '99 finals may have been tougher to swallow - but that late November loss to Batesville still burns in Burris' mind.
   
 "I don't dwell on it because we played a great game, but it's definitely something I've thought about," Burris said. "Morrilton won state (the following week), and since we had beaten them during the regular season I feel like we matched up well with them. (But) based on expectations, we kind of played with a chip on our shoulders all year.
   
 "No one really gave us much of a chance."
   
 In retrospect, Alma's 2013 game defines Burris. The former Alma linebacker wasn't the biggest, fastest or greatest linebacker of his era. But his 5-foot-8, 185-pound stature fits the mold of all the great who've passed through the program, including first-year Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz.
   
 "I try to get my guys to understand that," Burris said. "It's all about technique … the best effort and best technique is going to be successful more times than not. That goes back to all the little things. If they can do all the little things, it doesn't matter your height and weight and how fast you are.
   
 "At the end of the day it's high school football, and the person that wants it the most is probably going to be more successful."
   
 It's 7:08 a.m. and, as a heavy dew covers the damp turf at Citizens Bank Field at Airedale Stadium, Burris is back among his peers.
   
 "Alex is young and has a lot of energy. He talked to me about wanting to move up," first-year head coach Rusty Bush said. "He is young and doesn't have much experience, but he is the person you want on your staff. No. 1, he's a great football coach, and No. 2 he's an Alma kid that you want on your staff.
   
 "They (players) may be undersized and don't run as well, but they can be three-time all-state football players - that's a big reason I wanted him on the staff."
   
 "I like to bring energy," Burris said. "I feel like I brought that as a player and I feel like that's one of my main attributes I can bring as a coach, especially being the youngest guy on staff. Just being energetic and excited to be there every day, I feel like if I can do that my players will buy in even more.
   
 "Energy is contagious, so I try to bring that every day."
   
 A 2014 Alma grad, Burris graduated four years later from Arkansas Tech. And, after a couple of phone calls, found himself student coaching for Rick Jones' Greenwood Bulldogs.
   
 That fall, Greenwood finished a remarkable two-year run that saw the program crush Benton, 45-14, in the 6A championship game - the last of Jones' eight state titles during his 15-year run as the school's head coach.
   
 Burris takes a little piece of Rick Jones to work every day.
   
 "They (Greenwood) have a rep for having just great athletes, but you can see it from junior high to senior high- the change they (athletes) make as far as becoming next level," Burris said. "He's (Jones) one of the hardest working guys I know. He's there early, he's the last to leave every day. Every little detail is important, and that's something I've been able to take into coaching - don't make that little detail not important; every detail is important.
   
 "You have to hold kids accountable."
   
 Burris, who signed on to coach with Alma last year, will help first-year Alma defensive coordinator Ernest Pressley this season. Burris is also assisting with special teams.
   
 "When I got here, I didn't know the staff at all," Bush said. "I didn't know about Alex and people started telling me his story and what he means to Alma. I've said this before, my preconceived notion of Alma football is these tough hard-nosed physical kids, and that's what we want to build this brand, and it's great to have a face to go with the past."
   
 "I was about 5-8 and 185 pounds when I played," Burris said. "I wasn't the biggest. But you can compete with anybody as long as you give your effort and you do your assignment."

Knock on the door at 103 Marion Ave., and Cathy Graham will let you in.
 This is how it has been at Punta Gorda’s Copperfish Books in the time of COVID-19. In an effort to maintain the best possible social-distancing practices, co-owners Graham and Serena Wyckoff settled on a plan to allow just four or five walk-ins at a time into their cozy confines. It has added up to between 30 and 40 customers a day during this slowest time of the off-season.
 Ring the bell on the counter at 5240 Duncan Road, and Heidi Lange will answer it.
 She might have a half-finished face mask in her hand. A professional seamstress longer than she has been a bookstore owner, Lange can often be found stitching together face coverings between the dings at Sandman Books, located east of downtown Punta Gorda.
 Both independent bookstores have gamely navigated their way through these unwritten chapters, learning much about their customers and themselves.
 “When the pandemic hit, everyone sort of had to close, so we did close, but we kept functioning,” Graham said between knocks at the door. “We did have an online presence that wasn’t super robust, but then it took off, so that helped.”
 Lange’s family-owned enterprise moved to its new location on the edge of Punta Gorda a year ago and by February, she was beginning to think things were taking off.
 Not so fast, said the coronavirus. Fortunately, she had a sewing needle handy.
 “We actually would not have made it, but I’m also a seamstress and that’s pretty much what I’ve been doing for the last six months,” Lange said as she sat in her office while working on another of the many masks she sells in the shop and online. “My husband also knows how to sew now. My teenage son is 17. He learned how to sew. It’s been interesting. Honestly had it not been for that, it would be tight.”
 Online sales have been a revenue stream for some time now, but Copperfish and Sandman have added local delivery and curbside pickup to their operations. Copperfish delivers within a five-mile radius while Sandman delivers anywhere in a 15-mile radius with orders of $25 or more while offering free shipping on any orders over $35.
 Lange, ever watchful over what people are buying at any given time, has been especially interested in what has been selling during the pandemic.
 “People are at home watching TV and binging shows or movies, and people are wanting to read the books the shows are based on,” she said. Lange mentioned shows such as "The Witcher," "The Expanse" and "Altered Carbon." She is currently trying to get ahead of the demand for the latest book adaptation to hit the streaming services, "The Baby-Sitters Club."
 But there was a lag before books really began to sell again. In the gap between the shutdown and the phased re-opening, something curious happened at both stores.
 “Sometimes, I feel like we’ve just turned into a puzzle dealer instead of a bookstore,” Lange said.
 “For the first month, especially, when we were all on lockdown,” Graham agreed. “None of us could stock enough puzzles. We had to search all over the place. The traditional puzzle makers, the main folks we usually work with, ran out.”
 As book sales pick up, Lange has noticed an overall theme to the purchases in her shop that is in line with the book adaptations.
 “I noticed, too, people are reading more fantasy, more romance, more escapism,” she said. “Not a whole lot of nonfiction right now. I think people are just done. They need a break.”
 The genres are a great fit for Southwest Florida’s largest independent bookstore. The dark-stained shelves of reclaimed wood surround a massive set of arches constructed of books destined for recycling. A snaking dragon made of books floats over the shelves near the back of the store. Throughout the store are sitting areas with light fixtures and other features meant to evoke a Victorian steampunk feel.
 “I thought to myself, if Aquaman had a library, what would it look like?” Lange said with a laugh.
 Copperfish has always been a go-to store for mysteries. That has remained a constant.
 “The cozy mysteries, just a murder mystery that’s not so serious,” Graham said. On cue, a patron asked Graham about a specific mystery series. She guided them to the shelf in question. “I think people are having a harder time focusing, or they’re foggy. It’s hard. We are still selling more serious stuff, like Black Lives Matter and anti-racism, so people are reading that, but in the middle of it they’re just really needing to relax and take care of themselves.”
 Beyond the bottom line, what Graham and Lange have missed the most is that everyday interaction with the community. Copperfish has strong ties to local authors and that is apparent when perusing the store’s shelves, which feature a large collection of local writing, local history and other odds and ends of Floridian theme and origin.
 Before the pandemic, Copperfish and Sandman routinely held author events at their stores and at nearby restaurants. At times, they attracted hundreds of people. Since the shutdown, all author appearances have come via special- invite Zoom events.
 “The biggest difficulty for us is that we miss the community,” Graham said. “We took for granted that we put on events here where 50 or 100 people would show up. We don’t have that now. We miss them and they miss us. Zoom is not the same.”
 Lange spoke of a specific, heartbreaking instance where a long-time patron had a falling out with her concerning the mask ordinance.
 “He made a very large scene about it and said he’s never coming back again after 13 years of being a customer,” she said. “I’m sorry. It sucks. But we have to wear them. They’re yelling at me ... It’s especially frustrating with him because he had called ahead and picked out his books. He didn’t even have to come inside the store. He could have called when he got here and I could have brought them out.
 “But he made a big scene,” Lange said with a sigh. “And he’s never shopping here again.”
 In the end, both owners know this, too, shall pass. When that time comes, no one knows. To that end, Lange said there’s something important the community needs to keep in mind.
 “People will say, ‘We love you guys. We’ll come in after the pandemic is over.’ Well, my landlord is still charging rent,” she said. “The power company is still charging for power. My mortgage company still wants me to pay my bills. You wait another six months until the pandemic is over, we might not be here.
 “Even though we’ve done things to adapt to it and make it possible for people to still shop, people are still saying that,” Lange continued. “If you want to come in after it’s over, you need to come in or shop online right now.”

In light of the United States Supreme Court's decision in McGirt v. Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation has established a commission to make funding and resource recommendations to appropriately respond to the legal ramifications of the decision.
   
 Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. on Thursday signed an executive order to establish the Commission for the Protection of Cherokee Nation Sovereignty. Hoskin also proposed the Cherokee Nation Reservation, Judicial Expansion and Sovereignty Protection Act for Tribal Council approval, which would allow the Nation "to apply for federal funding and resources and to bring in court referees to help on assigned cases," according to a Wednesday news release.
   
 The United States Supreme Court in July ruled virtually all of eastern Oklahoma remains Native American land in deciding Jimcy McGirt should not have been tried at a state level in his 1997 case. Officials expect this ruling to result in an increased caseload in federal courts in this region -- District 27 Attorney Jack Thorp estimates the Eastern District of Oklahoma will take on 20,000-30,000 new cases from the decision.
   
 "We must begin taking steps to expand our Marshal Service, Attorney General's Office, detention and probation budgets, our tribal court system and other areas, while staying engaged in any congressional response to legislation that protects our tribal sovereignty, keeps this historic ruling intact and ensures criminals that commit violent acts on Cherokee Nation reservation lands do not go free," Hoskin said in the news release.
   
 According to the news release, the commission will analyze costs, resource concerns and necessary steps as the Cherokee Nation prepares to exercise expanded jurisdiction. It will also give input on courts, law enforcement in their reservation and virtually all facets of the criminal justice system in their jurisdiction, both for Indians and non-Indians.
   
 The order also requires all Cherokee Nation departments that intersect with the Cherokee Nation Court, Attorney General and Marshals Service impacted by McGirt to submit a report of how they are impacted and proposed recommendations. The Cherokee Nation attorney general may also create the Inter-Governmental Law Enforcement Task Force comprised of law enforcement officials and state and federal prosecutors under the order, the release states.
   
 "This court decision is the largest victory for Indian Country in our lifetime, but also represents new challenges for the Cherokee Nation, so we are preparing vigorously for what we anticipate is coming," Hoskin said. "I look forward to a detailed report from the commission in the coming weeks."
