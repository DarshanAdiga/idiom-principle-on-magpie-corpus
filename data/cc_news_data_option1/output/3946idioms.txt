For four years, Ausprey and fellow University of Florida Ph.D. student Felicity Newell, a study co-author, surveyed birds in the cloud forests of northern Peru, part of the tropical Andes, a global biodiversity hotspot. In these forests, light is structured on a vertical gradient, powerful at the canopy and increasingly weaker as it filters down to the darkest parts of the understory. Gaps in the canopy open up patches of startling brightness, changing light intensity "over infinitesimally small scales," Ausprey said. "You can go from being very dark to very bright within inches."

Primack, the biologist, has wondered whether in some cases, the animals spotted during the pandemic had been visiting urban spaces all along.

But first, there were some logistics to overcome. In the lab, there can be a lot of fussing with the equipment to get the coil to the exact right spot on someone's head.

Ao mesmo tempo, procurou também colecionar muitas das invenções do britânico Clive Sinclair, pai do computador ZX Spectrum, cujas criações eram marcadas pela obsessão pelo baixo preço e pela miniaturização - calculadoras eletrónicas de bolso, uma calculadora de pulso, rádios do tamanho de uma caixa de fósforos, televisões minúsculas ou até um veículo elétrico (que chegou a ser usado pelo piloto Ayrton Senna).
 Com uma coleção tão grande, João Ramos, que é natural de Cantanhede, decidiu desafiar o município a fazer uma exposição, que foi inaugurada, em 2019, no Museu da Pedra.
 O sucesso foi tal que município e colecionador decidiram dar o próximo passo e criar um museu na antiga escola primária de Cantanhede.
 "O que vamos encontrar aqui? Este é um espaço dedicado à revolução tecnológica simbolizada pelo ZX Spectrum, o primeiro computador de muitos portugueses e de muitos europeus e um computador com uma história muito forte ligada a Portugal, que muitos portugueses não sabem", contou à agência Lusa João Ramos.
 O objetivo não é ser a maior coleção do mundo, mas antes convidar a conhecer aquele universo que disse tanto a tantos jovens nos anos 1980 e que também é uma marca numa revolução tecnológica que continua nos dias de hoje, explicou.

By the end of 1980s, all across America, ‘Black Friday’ was commonly used to refer to the sales (and masses of people who went to them) that took place around November 27 after the Thanksgiving holiday. This is also because it refers to retailers, who profited greatly over that one weekend, having profits or otherwise being "in the black". This phrase comes from how accountants used black ink to denote profits in their books, as opposed to red ink which was used to record losses.

Roberts and Badran knew they had one chance to make the experiment work. These flights are costly, and the bulk of the research grant was going toward that expense. In each 20 to 30 seconds of weightlessness, they would need to start the software on their computers, which would send a signal to the coil, register a thumb twitch and then report back that the TMS had worked. If it didn't register a thumb twitch, then the system would increase power and send another signal until a thumb twitch registered. But if it didn't work at all, they would have to troubleshoot on the fly—or face the possibility of the entire experiment being a complete failure.

 Geordie fans have grown restless over the changing systems and lack of front foot football on display and the clash with Burnley is a major opportunity to get back on track.
 Newcastle are mid-table with four points, with a Carabao Cup quarter final at Brentford to look forward to in December, making for a decent start to the season on paper.
 But Newcastle need to get more out of new signing Callum Wilson, start to dominate in midfield more, and show evidence of a plan emerging.

The Onyx Boox Max Lumi is the first 13.3 inch e-note that has a front-lit display and color temperature system. Since it uses a glass based screen, it is impossible to determine how many white and amber LED lights there are, they must be using a lot, because the light distribution is absolutely insane, there is no blotches or dark areas of the screen, when brightness is cranked to the max. Even when you tilt the screen on an angle, the light is great and the screen is readable.  I honestly think this lighting system destroys all of the 10.3 inch e-notes/e-readers too.

 While coping with this extremely challenging situation, Tejas was also trying to recoup money outlaid for his wedding. He said most companies booked have issued partial refunds, with the exception of one – caterers La Freshco in Uxbridge, who have refused to return a penny of the £6,600 paid.
 Tejas said: “They refused point blank to refund anything and had the tenacity to state they have been fair by not asking for the last £3,300 instalment, due just as lockdown hit. Significant money has been lost due to this company not being compassionate enough to refund any money despite our event being cancelled.
 “All in all, we have lost over £15,000, which could have been a lot worse had it not been for certain companies being so decent in their responses.”
 This paper has tried several times to speak with Vishal Sharma, owner of La Freshco, but he has not been available. In an email he said he was prepared to allow the couple to postpone their booking, but only a cancellation had been requested. “Of course as a company we have incurred costs,” he said.
 Tejas and Sai now plan to tie the knot at a small UK civil ceremony in October.
