 Most of us still have a few unanswered questions regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.
 For example, do we know how long people are infectious after transmission? And just how long do microdroplets hang in the air? How careful should be when unpacking our groceries?
 And then, of course, there's the sex toy question. Can we catch the virus by using someone else's sex toys? Should we be covering them with a condom?
 Ever wonder about that? Yeah, me neither. But that didn't stop the City of Toronto's public health department from answering those questions with its "Safer Sex During COVID-19" fact sheet. In case you don't have time to read it, the document advises against sharing sex toys. You should also clean that rabbit and, if you're in doubt, put a condom on it. Now you know.
 The guidelines for safer pandemic sex also discourage people from hooking up, despite the fact that it's pretty pro-sex, overall. Monogamous couples living in the same household, for example, may discover that sex may be a "way of dealing with anxiety" and/or fulfil the need for intimacy." More questions answered.
 If you aren't lucky enough to have a partner in your house to help you out with that, the guidelines suggest it's time to start consensual sexting, hanging out in chat rooms and having virtual sex. Of all the surprises 2020 has delighted us with so far, state-sanctioned cybersex and masturbation is the one we didn't see coming.
 State-sanctioned sex acts aren't new in Canada -- it's just that heterosexual monogamous sex has historically been the only one to get the thumbs up. That changed a little in Canada in the late 1960s, after Pierre Elliott Trudeau famously declared the state would get out of the nation's bedrooms. It didn't change completely, though.
 As Toronto researcher Tom Hooper discovered, even though the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1968-69 has been credited with decriminalizing homosexuality, arrests for "gross indecency" actually went up in Toronto for a complicated cluster of reasons, including the fact that group sex and bathhouse sex, which were pretty common, were still illegal. The law was based on somebody's idea of what queer sex might look like, as opposed to the reality.
 I can't help but wonder if there's an echo of that in these guidelines. Is this a realistic path to safer sex during COVID-19?
 "The statement from Toronto Public Health just says don't have sex with anyone unless you live with them," says Alexander McClelland, a post-doctoral fellow in the University of Ottawa's department of criminology whose previous work has focused on the criminalization of people with HIV-AIDS. "So, this isn't very helpful because there are going to be people who are still going to be hooking up with people whether we think it's irresponsible or not. This doesn't really give people any realistic practical tactics."
 More useful, perhaps, would be some suggestions for harm reduction strategies rooted in a more realistic idea of what sex actually looks like.
 In the Netherlands, for example, people were recently told to find a sex buddy and partner up. New York City's sex fact sheet recommends not having sex with people outside of their residence but, if they do, to have sex "with as few people as possible," since "having close contact -- including sex -- with only a small circle of consenting people helps prevent spreading COVID-19."
 Also, New Yorkers are advised it would be prudent to skip rimming till the pandemic is over.
 As we move past the initial shock and lockdown stages of the pandemic, people with experience in assessing safety in relation to contagious diseases are urging people to adopt more nuanced ideas about risk.
 There's a lot of room in between total self-isolation and, say, sharing bottles with strangers at an underground party in someone's basement. That same thinking can be applied to sex, an idea that Toronto group Fagdemic is working to promote through social media (@fagdemic on Instagram and Twitter) by offering "harm reduction for a coronaworld."
 "People are having sex," says Jonathan Valelly, one of the artists and activists behind the harm reduction project. "They are meeting on Tinder, Grinder and Scruff, so rather than thinking of things as being either inherently safe or unsafe, what if we think about that in-between space? Sure, there's a higher risk when you meet someone versus when you don't but acknowledging and using a harm-reduction framework like this can also reduce risks."
 One of the most important components of harm reduction in relation to sex under COVID-19 is communication. People have to open up a dialogue about the number of partners they have, as well as other risk factors, such as their exposure at work.
 For this to work, though, it's important that we steer clear of stigmatizing or policing people, which might force people to hide the truth. We made that mistake when it came to dealing with HIV-AIDS. It's important we avoid making it again.
 To avoid it, clear language, frank discussions and moving away from black and white assessments of risk are key. The Toronto Public Health guidance fails on at least one front here.
 "I think one wonders 'Who is reading that one-sheeter and really taking it to heart,' you know?" says Valelly. "We are all autonomous individuals who are making our decisions around COVID-19 similar to the way we make decisions around our sexual health in non-pandemic times, and I think public health messaging from a number of different agencies are often written in the hope that it really hits somebody.
 "But we actually have a pretty engaged public right now and people are listening to virologists with gusto and making their own informed decisions, so I think saying something like 'physical contact is high risk for transmitting the coronavirus' is kind of like, well, duh," he says.

Earlier in the day, hundreds of people, including several families, marched through downtown Boston on Sunday carrying signs reading “Justice for George” and “Silence is betrayal,” among others, and chanting “Hands up, don't shoot.” Orderly but energized and angry at times, the crowd took over one side of a city street as they passed City Hall, the Statehouse,and the Public Garden.
 Some passing motorists honked in support, and in one case, several bikers revved their motorcycles, prompting cheers from the crowd. The demonstration then gathered in Boston Common, an iconic park in the heart of Boston, with some kneeling for several minutes in memory of Floyd and raising their fists in the air.
 The earlier peaceful nature of the protests was in stark contrast to violence that has rocked cities across the country in recent days in response to the death of Floyd.
 “They keep killing our people. I’m so sick and tired of it," said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at the afternoon protest with her mother and was leading chants of “George Floyd, say his name." “On the news, every time we say black lives matter they keep silencing us. Things are going to change. It's going to change around here. They’re not going to kill black people for no reason."
 Others said the killing of Floyd on top of the coronavirus that has disproportionately hit communities of color and resulted in job losses made it imperative they come out and protest.
 “The recent events between COVID, the killing of George Floyd, the injustices this society is sort of predicated on are just surfacing in a very undeniable way,” said Silvian Castaneda, a 62-year-old social worker from Medford who came to the rally with several family members and friends. “We've got to do something.”
 The safety concerns of the coronavirus were also on the minds of protesters, many who wore masks but rarely practiced social distancing. They were packed shoulder to shoulder as they marched which had several of them a little anxious.
 “It isn't comfortable to be at home but it's really uncomfortable to be here, too, and know you're doing this in the face of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Vivian Lee, 22, who participated with her sister and parents. “But it requires some discomfort for change.”
 A third protest featured church leaders who rallied outside Boston police headquarters, according to The Boston Globe. After speaking out against police brutality as well as income inequality and lack of coronavirus testing, the crowd observed a moment of silence for 8 minutes and 49 seconds, a reference to the several minutes the officer pressed his knee to Floyd's neck.

UK opposition parties have urged Johnson to avoid this outcome by extending the transition period, which is scheduled to end on December 31. It can be extended by up two years, under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.
 Major business groups have issued the same plea. The logistics industry has warned the UK government that British hauliers cannot prepare for January while dealing with the effects of the coronavirus. Other business groups are waiting for the outcome of this month's crunch meeting before deciding whether to also go public.
 Yet, despite warnings about the damage a crash-out on January 1, 2021 would do, the UK government is insistent that it will neither request nor accept an extension to the transition period -- and this message has been heard loud and clear in EU capitals. Johnson's government says extending the transition would only create more uncertainty for business, and delay the UK's sovereign decision to detach itself from the EU's core institutions.
 The UK's hardline opposition to extending the transition period has created suspicion in Brussels that Johnson's government is actually aiming to leave without a deal.

The U.S. has seen over 1.7 million infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the pandemic, which has disproportionately affected racial minorities in a nation that does not have universal health care.
 Even the many protesters wearing masks are not guaranteed protection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says cloth masks keep infected people from spreading the virus but are not designed to protect wearers from getting it.
 Mass protests in connection with Floyd's death were also being held in Europe.
 In London, thousands of people marched Sunday  chanting "No justice! No peace!" while carrying signs reading "Justice for George Floyd" and "Racism is a global issue." Many demonstrators were not wearing masks and most in the crowd at Trafalgar Square were packed closely together.
 In Berlin, hundreds of protesters picketed outside the U.S. Embassy on Saturday night under the motto: "Justice for George Floyd." Others marched near the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark.
 Many Americans returned Sunday to in-person church services for the first time in weeks and tens of thousands of mosques reopened across the Middle East, but countries from India to Colombia still saw rising numbers of new infections.
 Nearly 6.1 million infections have been reported worldwide, with nearly 370,000 people dying, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true death toll is believed to be significantly higher, since many victims died of the virus without ever being tested.
 The situation worsened Sunday in India, where new daily cases topped 8,000 for the first time and 193 more deaths were reported. Despite that, India still is easing restrictions on shops and public transport in more states beginning Monday, although subways and schools will remain closed.
 In Saudi Arabia, mosques reopened Sunday for the first time in more than two months, but Islam's holiest site in Mecca remained closed. In Jerusalem, throngs of worshippers waited outside the Al-Aqsa Mosque before it reopened. Many wore surgical masks and waited for temperature checks as they entered.

The multinational team on the biggest Arctic research mission ever undertaken were prepared for problems from polar bear attacks to major snowstorms or even issues with building a runway on ice.
 But never did they imagine that a pandemic might sweep across the world, posing a threat to their mission.
 "We have many many different scenarios, alternative plans in store," Markus Rex, who leads the MOSAIC mission, told AFP by phone on his way to Spitsbergen, the main island on the archipelago of Svalbard.
 "But to have a global pandemic of this scale, that was something we did not expect... We had to develop new plans very quickly."
 With borders slamming shut as governments sought to limit transmission of the coronavirus, the team out on the mission was all but cut off.
 A team had been due to be flown in April to relieve the scientists on the ice, but the plan had to be rethought.
 After two months of delay, a new crew is finally en route to Spitsbergen on two vessels, which will then meet up with the icebreaker Polarstern to allow the newcomers to disembark and the current team to come onboard.
 Among the group heading out to the field is mission chief Rex himself, a climatologist and physicist.
 \- Keeping the virus out -
 The 390-day expedition began in September, with the icebreaker belonging to Germany's Alfred Wegener polar and marine institute departing to great fanfare from Norway.
 The mission aims to study the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice, ecosystem and natural processes -- looking to build a picture of how climate change is affecting the region and the entire world.
 Some 600 experts are involved in the biggest research project on the Arctic.
 At the end of February, the icebreaker's drift took it to just 156 kilometres from the North Pole -- never before had a ship ventured so far north during the Arctic winter.
 Experts from about a dozen countries were meant to fly to the Polarstern from Svalbard in April. But the closure of borders had grounded available planes.
 After several hurdles, the team decided to bring the scientists as well as supplies by research ships to Spitsbergen.
 The Polarstern will interrupt its research for several weeks to pick up the new crew.
 But figuring out the logistics of the complicated personnel transfer was one thing, "our second difficulty: ensure that the virus does not get into the expedition," said Rex.
 So crew members were put on a strict 14-day quarantine in Bremerhaven before they set off on the two research vessels.
 Two hotels were exclusively booked out for that purpose.
 "The doors were not open, there was no contact to anyone else during the quarantine and so we were sure that the virus would not be introduced into the group during the quarantine too. Food was placed before the door," said Rex.
 To entertain themselves, the confined scientists sang the Beatles' "Yellow Submarine" from their windows, according to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
 "Everyone was tested three times," said Rex, relieved that the mission on which he has spent 11 years of his life can continue.
 \- Staying in touch -
 On board the Polarstern, which has already endured 150 days of polar nights and temperatures as low as -39.5 degrees Celsius, scientists have seen the pandemic roll out from a distance.
 "Many of them have families and tried to stay in as close contact as possible with them by satellite telephone," said Torsten Kanzow, who is currently on the ice-breaker.
 Thankfully, the team have had no problems with their food supplies -- which are sufficient to last a few months.
 If all goes well with the personnel transfer, Rex noted that at the end, there should not be too much impact on their research, beyond a short interruption on collection of some measurements while the Polarstern is on the way to meet up with the two research ships.
 "There are automatic measuring devices at the research camp that are sending new data to us daily, that we're eagerly looking at every day.
 "In an expedition that lasts 13 months, it's still fine to bear with an interruption of some measurements," said Rex.
 The expedition will draw to an end on October 12.

This means, in reality, both sides have just a few months to strike a deal. In total, UK and EU negotiators have less than a year to negotiate a free trade agreement, while most deals take a few years to be thrashed out and put into law.
 Ruperal told Business Insider: "If there is a breakthrough, it [the negotiations] can begin to move quite quickly, potentially. If there is a big breakthrough, the rest can fall into place. But the absolute latest would have to be the end of October or start of November. That's when you'd have to get things pushed towards ratification."
 The Institute For Government on Saturday released a paper setting out other ways both sides could create more time for talks while extending transition remains off the table. Both the UK and EU have already ruled out one option, which is attaching to a trade deal an implementation period for businesses to prepare for new trading arrangements.
 The UK in a Changing Europe's Menon said that while a major breakthrough in negotiations was more likely in the autumn, so was Prime Minister Johnson taking the nuclear option and deciding to walk away from talks altogether.

 "In most areas there is a landing zone that would seem reasonable to both sides," Ruperal told Business Insider.

The shelter already has hundreds of applications in the pipeline from since the start of the pandemic, so many of those earlier applicants will get consideration first if a dog or cat comes in that might be a good match, she said.
 At the moment, there are fewer than 40 animals available, including a few who have struggled to find their new families. But the shelter is expecting new dogs to start arriving next month from shelters in other parts of the country, said Garabedian. The shelter has been rescuing dogs from shelters where animals are euthanized for years through its program Saving Homeless Pets Across America.
 "Right now, our focus is to find permanent homes for the pets in foster care," said Garabedian.
 She said there have been approximately 1,000 offers from area residents to "foster" animals until they could be adopted. There are approximately another 3,000 applications, though not all of those will be approved.
 Part of the reason for the delay was due to staffing. To minimize contact, the shelter has been operating with a skeleton crew.
 The shelter staff also tried to make sure there would be room for dogs or cats that had to be surrendered due to illnesses. But thankfully, that hasn't been a major issue at this point.

 Smith was last seen in action against New Zealand in the first ODI of the three-match series in March this year.
 After the first ODI, the series between both sides was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 Smith would have been leading the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL if the tournament had started on March 29.

Tehran said Monday that scientist Sirous Asgari, one of more than a dozen Iranians behind bars in the United States, is set to return to the Islamic republic within days.
 Asgari was accused by a US court in 2016 of stealing trade secrets while on an academic visit to Ohio.
 But the 59-year-old scientist from Tehran's Sharif University of Technology was acquitted in November.
 The academic told British newspaper The Guardian in March that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was keeping him in a detention centre in Louisiana without basic sanitation and refusing to let him return to Iran despite his exoneration.
 "Dr. Sirous Asgari's case has been closed in America and he will probably return to the country in the next two or three days," said Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi.
 "That is, if no issues or obstacles come up," he said, quoted by semi-official news agency ISNA.
 Iran's foreign ministry said last month that Asgari had contracted the novel coronavirus while in US custody.
 If he returns to Iran, the scientist would become one of the few detainees held by either side not to have been released in a prisoner exchange.
 Both Iran and the United States hold a number of each other's nationals and they have recently called for them to be released amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Iran is battling what is the Middle East's deadliest outbreak of the virus, while the US has reported the highest total number of deaths worldwide from the disease.
 \- Prisoner swaps -
 Iran is holding at least five Americans and the US has 19 Iranians in detention, according to a list compiled by AFP based on official statements and media reports.
 Tensions between the two arch enemies escalated in 2018, after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a landmark nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy.
 Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said last month that Tehran had offered "some time ago" to exchange all Iranian and US prisoners but was waiting for a response from the US.
 Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of US homeland security, responded mockingly by saying Iran should "send a charter plane over" and return its nationals.
 Mousavi hit back on Twitter by saying the world "is watching your action, not your word".
 The Islamic republic in December freed Xiyue Wang, a US academic, in exchange for scientist Massoud Soleimani and said it was open to further swaps.
 It has also said it has released more than 100,000 inmates, including 1,000 foreigners, to ease the pressure on Iran's prison system during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Americans and dual nationals currently known to be held by Iran include US Navy veteran Michael R. White, Siamak Namazi along with his father Baquer, Morad Tahbaz, Gholam Reza Shahini, and Karan Vafadari.
 Asgari is one of the 19 held by the US, most of them dual nationals and charged with evading sanctions by either exporting goods to Iran or using the US financial system.
 Long-time foes Iran and the United States have appeared to come to the brink of a direct conflict twice in the past year.
 The most recent case was in January when Iran fired a barrage of missiles at US troops stationed in Iraq in retaliation for a US drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general.
 Trump refrained from taking any military action in response, however.

Irfan Pathan revealed he had asked MS Dhoni to just laugh when Pathan would sledge Shoaib Akhtar. "Akhtar was sledging as always, trying to get into our minds and break the partnership. I told Dhoni 'I will sledge Akhtar and you just laugh at him' and Dhoni agreed to it. Akhtar continued sledging us and at the time, the ball was also starting to reverse swing, which was even more dangerous for us. Our plan was to negate the reverse swing on the ball, which we could do if we could Akhtar to bowl shorter deliveries, Irfan Pathan told Sports Tak.

Star UFC fighter Jon Jones has threatened to walk away from his light heavyweight title amid a pay dispute with the MMA promotion. The American fighter is keen on a lucrative battle with Francis Ngannou but the UFC doesn't want to pay him enough to make the move up to a higher weight category. UFC President, Dana White, said that Jones has demanded money to the tune of $15 million to $30 million.This comes just a week after White had called Jones, the reigning pound-for-pound No 1, as the greatest UFC fighter in history.
 Jones took to Twitter on Sunday night and wrote: "To the light-heavyweight title - veni, vidi, vici," (the Latin phrase for "I came, I saw, I conquered").
 During conversation with his followers, Jones revealed that he is going to walk away from the fight. When a follower suggested that he was damaging himself more than UFC by walking away, Jones wrote, ""I hurt myself every time I walk out there and take a punch to the head and not feel my pay is worth it anymore."


   
   
 Both Jones and White have been bickering over the promotions for a while now. Jones has been the lightweight champion for almost a decade now and boasts of a mixed martial arts record of 26 wins and one loss (and one no contest).

Curtis had studied French when he was in school, but he had forgotten the language as he grew older.
 However, his new tongue only lasted the initial conversation after recovering from the coma. His ability to speak French quickly vanished, BBC reported.
 The accident happened in August, 2014 when his Transit van bore the brunt of a six-car pile-up.
 It took firefighters 40 minutes to free Curtis from the wreckage.
 He had to be put into an induced coma at the scene due to his severe injuries and airlifted to a hospital in Birmingham. He remained comatose for six days. His family were told that it was unlikely he'd ever walk or talk properly again.
 Upon recovery from his coma, Curtis was also convinced that he was a 10-year- old again. He even enquired about his family dog to his mother, who had to inform him that the dog had died years ago.
 "The second she said that, I put two and two together," Curtis remembers. "I was thinking, 'Oh, yeah. What am I on about?' And then I would think I was 12. It was tying the knots together in my brain, in my memory."
 Rory Curtis had played for Walsall's academy, with Manchester United retaining an option to call him up. He had shown promise as a young striker, but injuries and illness led to a decline and early end to his footballing career.
 He currently runs his own salon.

A 16-minute audio clip purportedly  of a  senior police officer in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district  telling another officer how the  police is working on directions of some politicians and journalists and how sub- inspectors have become "businessmen"  may point towards some serious trouble in the force.The audio clip went viral during transfers of inspector general of police, Morena zone, DP Gupta, and superintendent of police and collector of Bhind district Nagendra Singh and Chhote Singh on Saturday night.Bhind has been in news in the last fortnight after deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Rajesh Hingankar  twice raided  illegal sand mines and seized machines used for illegal mining. After the raids, he suspended in-charges of five police stations and two constables. The constables were posted in Sheopur and were allegedly patronising  the sand mafia in the district. One of the constables, who belongs to Bhind, allegedly ran an office from his native place to facilitate illegal sand mining. The then SP of Bhind, Nagendra Singh, who was shifted to Bhopal on Saturday, defended the constables saying they were stranded in Bhind because of the lockdown and charges against them were unfounded.The audio clip, the authenticity of which HT cannot vouch for, features a senior police officer  trying to motivate the police personnel by saying that they should speak to their senior officials and public representatives about right or wrong in the district.Another officer talks about how police were working on directions of some politicians and journalists.  "Don't get demotivated by what is happening. Let all senior officers and public representatives' phones ring with your calls about what is going on here. Do talk to them. Tell them what is correct. If I am wrong tell them that too," the first  officer is heard saying.Appreciating the police force's work in containing the spread of Coronavirus in the district the officer says, "I receive many phone calls for (postings) in two police stations. Such sub-inspectors should be asked if Madhya Pradesh police has stopped paying salary to them. Why this craving? Why go to these places? How many criminals were arrested by you?....Many inspectors call me up to make a request to let them spend their time in police lines instead of sending them to Dehat and Kotwali police station. I feel ashamed of them."On being asked by the officer during the conversation to express their opinions another police officer is heard saying, "Sir, you should have come here 20 years back. Then you and myself would have worked together to improve the situation in Bhind. But the sub-inspectors and police stations in charge of the new generation are thoroughly corrupt. You are not their boss. Their bosses are MLA, MP and journalists. They have pledged their police uniform. They have become businessmen."The conversation ends with the first officer  saying he didn't expect that everyone would become honest overnight but they should work hard while keeping the priorities of the police department in their mind. "No goonda even if he is a politician should have courage to sit in the chair in front of a police station in charge," he said. When contacted Nagendra Singh said, "I have been transferred now. I would not like to make any comment on this."Deputy inspector general of police, Morena range Rajesh Hingankar said, "I have not received any complaint regarding any such audio clip."

 Attorneys typically draw up advance directives when they’re creating someone’s estate plan, but you don’t need to go to an attorney to get this done, McClanahan says.
 Many sites, including AARP and Everplans, offer links to free forms for each state. Five Wishes offers an interactive version for $5. McClanahan likes the free advance directive forms at Prepare for Your Care, a site founded by Rebecca Sudore, a geriatrician and professor at University of California, San Francisco. The Prepare for Your Care site focuses on the quality of life you want — what you value about your life and what would make you want to go on living, or not.
 “The problem that too many advanced directives get into is they’re asking people about medical procedures that they don’t quite understand,” McClanahan says.
 People also worry that their choices are set in stone, which isn’t true, says CFP Linda Rogers of San Diego.
 “If you want to change something tomorrow, you can change it. But put something down on paper, otherwise the courts or the hospital could decide for you,” Rogers says.
 PICK YOUR ADVOCATE AND A BACKUP
 When choosing the person who will make decisions for you, consider who would be most capable of advocating for what you want, rather than what they, other family members or a medical provider might want.

As it turns out, the pandemic hit at the very time during which MLB was involved in combative negotiations with the minor leagues on a new Professional Baseball Agreement. For many, those talks have come to be viewed as an assault. That's been the case since last fall, when plans calling for the loss of affiliation for more than 40 teams were leaked. Those talks have continued in the same vein, even as minor league franchises have fallen into an existential crisis due to the shutdown, with an almost certain-to-be- canceled season leaving clubs with a near-complete loss of revenue.
 While big league markets can hope for baseball's near-term return, all of those markets in between MLB cities cannot. Even as those markets come to terms with that, it's all unfolding with the distinct possibility that the prosperous minor league system that was in place will return in a very different form -- if at all. None of this helps engender sympathy from baseball fans for MLB's negotiating efforts.
 Not that all fans are enamored of the players' viewpoint in all of this. While it is fair to ask whether it's productive to choose sides in the negotiations (aren't we on the side of baseball?), anti-player sentiment is largely driven by a fairly small set of social media eruptions. In the end, even if you do favor one side or the other, it still comes down to a negotiation dominated by money at a time when the general populace has little stomach for sports- related negotiations about money, especially one between rich people.
 Baseball officials have talked about the opportunity for its resumption to signify a return to normalcy, as it did in other times of national crisis, such as the world wars and the 2001 terrorist attacks. Instead, the very public negotiations underway between the owners and players, and MLB and the minors, create a perception that only baseball is more concerned with divvying up cash and mitigating loss than helping us all move toward some sort of new normal. Again, fair or not, it just feels like the NBA and NHL simply want to figure out a way to safely finish their seasons. If they do so while MLB remains bogged down in negotiations, it's going to be a blow to baseball's place in the sports pecking order. Baseball's Q-Rating could end up somewhere south of lacrosse.
 Fair or not, that is the cloud looming over baseball's talks. It's not a stretch to say that the legacies of both Clark and Manfred hang in the balance as events unfold in the days to come. Baseball had a golden opportunity to aid in our collective healing and, in doing so, remind us all of the kind of cultural impact that our oldest league can have. Alas, unless Clark, Manfred and their respective sides pull a proverbial rabbit out of the hat, that opportunity might already be lost.

A few hit or miss showers and thundershowers will be possible Tuesday and Wednesday, especially during the afternoon hours. Not everyone will see the rain midweek. By the end of the week, more sunshine returns to the forecast with quickly warming temperatures into the lower 90s. The weekend brings some uncertainty as we watch the Gulf of Mexico for any tropical development. An area of disturbance in the Bay of Campeche could develop into a tropical system this week and drift northward toward the Gulf coast.Copyright 2020 KLTV/KTRE. All rights reserved.

Queens Park Rangers CEO Lee Hoos says he is "stunned" and "appalled" by plans for the Championship to return on June 20 given how little time players will have to get up to speed.
 Clubs in England's second tier did not return to any sort of training until May 25 and will only begin contact training this week.
 "I am absolutely stunned by this announcement, as is our director of football Les Ferdinand and our manager Mark Warburton," said Hoos in a statement.
 "The players haven’t even returned to full-contact training at this moment and yet they are now expected to be in a position to play at a competitive level in just three weeks' time.
 "I have made our feelings known to the EFL (English Football League) and, having spoken with a number of CEOs at other Championship clubs, I am not a lone voice on this matter. We are absolutely appalled."
 The EFL confirmed the proposed return date on Sunday and said discussions were ongoing with clubs over whether to allow the use of five substitutes and increase matchday squads from 18 to 20 to ease the stress on players.
 The remaining nine rounds of matches would be squeezed into a packed month of action, with plans for the play-off final to take place "on or around 30 July".
 QPR were 13th in the table when the season was halted in March, six points off the playoff places and 11 points clear of the relegation zone.

An Indian-origin scientist, who is part of a team of Oxford University professionals on a project to find a vaccine to protect against the coronavirus, says she feels honoured to be a part of a humanitarian cause, with the world's hopes attached to the outcome.Chandrabali Datta, who was born in Kolkata, works in the Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility at the university's Jenner Institute where Phase II and III of human trials of the vaccine named ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 are being conducted as a possible tool to fight the deadly virus.The 34-year-old's role as a Quality Assurance Manager means it is her task to ensure all levels of compliance are met before the vaccine could progress to the trial stage."We are all hoping that it works in the next stage; the whole world is looking to this vaccine," said Datta."It's like a humanitarian cause to be a part of this project. We are a non-profit organisation, putting in extra hours everyday just to make this vaccine successful, so that human lives can be saved. It is a massive team effort and everyone has worked around the clock towards its success. I feel honoured to be a part of this project," she said.While her own "close knit" team of 25 experts on the production side of the vaccine is extremely gender balanced, Datta is keen to encourage young girls in India to challenge a perceived male dominance in the field of bioscience."If you are motivated and up for a challenge, then this is your field. Nowadays, biotech and pharma are getting an equal male-female ratio so there are lots of opportunities," she said."The scientific field is not highly paid, so you have to get rid of your materialistic desires if you want to be successful in this field. But if your motivation is really high and you are up for the struggle, then this is a very rewarding area of work. There is lots of recognition for your hard work because at the end of the day you are improving human lives," she says, as a message for young girls considering a career in bioscience.Datta, who studied engineering and biotechnology in Kolkata, was drawn to biology and mathematics in childhood. She went on to study computer science and even worked as an Associate Software Engineer with Accenture in India but was pulled back to biotech because of its "evolving and inventive" potential."My childhood friend was studying in Nottingham, who inspired me, and the UK is known for equal rights, women rights. So, I chose to do my Masters in biotech from the University of Leeds," she recalls."It has been a real struggle - leaving India and coming here. My mother wasn't too happy about her only child moving countries to study. But my father has always been ambitious for me and said I should chase my dreams and not compromise," she said.During this time, Datta balanced shifts at the supermarket and pizza restaurants with her laboratory experiments in order to cover living costs. After her degree, came more hardships in the form of a job hunt, which proved extremely challenging and involved drafting hundreds of applications a day.She recalls, "I remember I would finish my lab project and quickly run to Tesco to do evening shifts from 6.30pm to midnight. And, by the time I would get home, I didn't even have time to eat, I would just fall asleep. I would sleep only three hours a day."Getting a job wasn't easy without industry experience. Many of my peers went the PhD route but I wanted to be in the industry. A lot of my friends gave up and returned to India. But I refused to give up," she said.Her persistence paid off when she got a job at pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline as an R&D scientist developing inhalers. Her hard work and diligence saw her move up the ranks quickly until her current job at Oxford University about a year ago, where she finds herself a part of one of the world's most-talked-about vaccine projects."I have to make sure that all our departments are compliant, everyone is trained in whatever they are doing and following all standard operating procedures (SOPs). Particularly in this project, my contribution was to check that everything is compliant, SOPs are followed, no mistakes were made," she explains.But working through the lockdown as a key worker on the frontlines of the pandemic meant her parents back in Kolkata being constantly worried for her safety."My parents were really worried and paranoid about me going in to work during this crisis. But I had to help my team. Everyone is under stress, given the pandemic, and we supported each other through this crisis period. Whenever someone was struggling, there were people around to help," she said.While she manages to stay in touch with family and friends back in India through regular WhatsApp calls, Datta is hoping she can be with her parents for her annual Christmas trip by the end of the year."We have never seen a pandemic like this in our lives. We used to read in history but never imagined that in the 21st century we will actually see such a pandemic which will mean we have to be locked in our houses for months. The main focus is to bring human life back to normal and to save lives," she said. (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Cricket Australia announced the international season last week, scheduled to begin from August 9. Star batsman Smith, someone who loves shadow batting as much as he loves being in the middle, surprisingly did not pick up a bat for the last two months due to the lockdown.Smith said he focussed on physical and mental fitness during the forced break. "I haven't touched a bat, really. A couple of little drills at home but that's about it. I've just tried to switch off from it a bit, which I don't do very often. I was just focusing on getting myself fit and strong and refreshing mentally," he said.England cricketers have also begun training in a bio-secure environment and Sri Lankan players to resume practice on Monday.Smith said it was a welcome break from the game after a gruelling 2019. "I've done a few master classes at home (with fans online) ... but other than that I really haven't picked up a cricket bat. "It's been a bit different but I'm sure in the long run it will probably be a good thing to freshen up after a pretty long year and a half since the World Cup and Ashes."The ongoing health crisis has adversely affected the financial condition of Cricket Australia, which has had to stand down more than 200 staff.With uncertainty around the T20 World Cup in October-November, it is banking heavily on the India Test series starting in December.There is a possibility that the Australian cricket team's support staff will be down- sized for cost-cutting and Smith said he is prepared for that. "They all have a role to play, particularly as the game has evolved and got more professional. We've got people in different areas of expertise to help the team prepare and get ready to play. If that happens it will take some adjusting," Smith said."If that's the case, it'll be about guys being able to help each other out as well, particularly senior players being able to take a bit of time off your own game and help someone else out at training or something like that," he added.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

WASHINGTON (AP) - With cities wounded by days of violent unrest, America headed into a new week with neighborhoods in shambles, urban streets on lockdown and shaken confidence about when leaders would find the answers to control the mayhem amid unrelenting raw emotion over police killings of black people.All of it smashed into a nation already bludgeoned by a death toll from the coronavirus pandemic surging past 100,000 and unemployment that soared to levels not seen since the Great Depression.Sunday capped a tumultuous weekend and month that saw city and state officials deploy thousands of National Guard soldiers, enact strict curfews and shut down mass transit systems. Even with those efforts, many demonstrations erupted into violence as protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police in Philadelphia, set a fire near the White House and were hit with tear gas and pepper spray in Austin and other cities. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalized.In some cities, thieves smashed their way into stores and ran off with as much as they could carry, leaving shop owners, many of them just ramping up their business again after coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, to clean up their shattered storefronts.In others, police tried to calm tensions by kneeling in solidarity with demonstrators, while still maintaining a strong presence for security.The demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as an officer pressed a knee into his neck. Floyd's death in Minneapolis came after tensions had already flared after two white men were arrested in May for the February shooting death of black jogger Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, and the Louisville police shooting death of Breonna Taylor in her home in March.The scale of the coast-to-coast protests rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras."They keep killing our people. I'm so sick and tired of it," said Mahira Louis, 15, who was at a Boston protest with her mother Sunday, leading chants of "George Floyd, say his name."Tensions rose Sunday outside the White House, the scene of three days of demonstrations, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades into a crowd of more than 1,000 chanting protesters across the street in Lafayette Park. The crowd ran, piling up road signs and plastic barriers to light a raging fire in a nearby street. Some pulled an American flag from a building and threw it into the blaze. A building in the park with bathrooms and a maintenance office went up in flames. The district's entire National Guard — roughly 1,700 soldiers — was called in to help control the protests, according to two Defense Department officials who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.As the protests grew, President Donald Trump retweeted conservative commentator Buck Sexton who called for "overwhelming force" against violent demonstrators. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, visited the site of protests in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, and talked to demonstrators. He also wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about Floyd's killing.At least 4,400 people have been arrested over days of protests, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Arrests ranged from stealing and blocking highways to breaking curfew. In Salt Lake City, an activist leader condemned the destruction of property but said broken buildings shouldn't be mourned on the same level as black men like Floyd. "Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men," said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. "Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning."Yet thousands still marched peacefully in Phoenix, Albuquerque and other cities, with some calling for an end to the fires, vandalism and theft, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform.In downtown Atlanta, authorities fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of demonstrators. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said t wo officers had been fired and three placed on desk duty after video showed police surrounding a car Saturday, and using stun guns on the man and woman inside.In Los Angeles, a police SUV accelerated into several protesters in a street, knocking two people to the ground. Nearby in Santa Monica, not far from a peaceful demonstration, groups broke into stores, walking out with boxes of shoes and folding chairs, among other items. A fire broke out at a restaurant across the street. Scores swarmed into nearby outlet stores in Long Beach. Some hauled armloads of clothing from a Forever 21 store away in garbage bags. In Minneapolis, the officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd's neck has been charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the other three officers at the scene be prosecuted. All four were fired. "We're not done," said Darnella Wade, an organizer for Black Lives Matter in neighboring St. Paul, where thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol. "They sent us the military, and we only asked them for arrests." Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers on Saturday to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. That appeared to help minimize unrest, but thousands marching on a closed freeway were shaken when a semitrailer rolled into their midst. Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from lockdowns brought on by the pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions.In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence this weekend, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis.In tweets Sunday, Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at "far left extremist" groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of causing the problems.At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a "sacred space."Among those in Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014."I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling," he said.___Morrison reported from Minneapolis and Vertuno reported from Austin, Texas.

The alternative would be to agree a new deal with Luiz but one with a lower base salary.

 For all that there are questions to be asked over Arsenal's initial signing of Luiz - if they were so confident he was the man to hold the fort between Laurent Koscielny's departure and William Saliba settling into the team why not sign him for two years? - it may be that Sanllehi and Fahmy can make the best out of an uncomfortable situation.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has asked airlines to keep middle seats vacant if the load factor and seat capacity permits it. In case the middle seat is occupied, the regulator has asked airlines to provide additional protective equipment to passengers like "wrap-around gown."
 The directions are for strict compliance by all stakeholders and shall come into force from June 3.
 The directions have been sent on the basis of recommendations of an expert committee which was constituted post an order from the Supreme Court.
 In the order sent to all foreign and Indian airlines, Airports Authority of India, private airport operators, and ground handling agencies, DGCA has said asked airlines to provide safety kits to passengers including three-layered surgical mask, face shield, and sanitiser.
 In addition, the regulator has said that no meals or drinking water will be served except under extreme circumstances arising due to health reasons.
 "The MHA guidelines for lockdown 5.0 announced on May 30 will facilitate the gradual & calibrated reopening of the aviation sector. As we move towards a critical mass of 50-60 percent operation of domestic flights, our ability to resume international operations will also improve," Puri wrote on Twitter.
 Embarkation, disembarkation shall be sequential, Air should be replaced in aircraft in the shortest possible interval, sanitise aircraft after every sector keep clean aircraft at the end of the day, frequently clean lavatories in aircraft and provide full protective suits to pilots and cabin crew, the regulator has said in the order.
 The DGCA has also asked airlines and Airports shall explore the possibility of a disinfection Tunnel to ensure the safety of passengers.

A 16-minute audio clip purportedly  of a  senior police officer in Madhya Pradesh's Bhind district  telling another officer how the  police is working on directions of some politicians and journalists and how sub-inspectors have become "businessmen"  may point towards some serious trouble in the force.
 The audio clip went viral during transfers of inspector general of police, Morena zone, DP Gupta, and superintendent of police and collector of Bhind district Nagendra Singh and Chhote Singh on Saturday night.
 Bhind has been in news in the last fortnight after deputy inspector general (DIG) of police, Rajesh Hingankar  twice raided  illegal sand mines and seized machines used for illegal mining. After the raids, he suspended in-charges of five police stations and two constables. The constables were posted in Sheopur and were allegedly patronising  the sand mafia in the district. One of the constables, who belongs to Bhind, allegedly ran an office from his native place to facilitate illegal sand mining. The then SP of Bhind, Nagendra Singh, who was shifted to Bhopal on Saturday, defended the constables saying they were stranded in Bhind because of the lockdown and charges against them were unfounded.
 The audio clip, the authenticity of which HT cannot vouch for, features a senior police officer  trying to motivate the police personnel by saying that they should speak to their senior officials and public representatives about right or wrong in the district.
   
   
 Another officer talks about how police were working on directions of some politicians and journalists.  
 "Don't get demotivated by what is happening. Let all senior officers and public representatives' phones ring with your calls about what is going on here. Do talk to them. Tell them what is correct. If I am wrong tell them that too," the first  officer is heard saying.
 Appreciating the police force's work in containing the spread of Coronavirus in the district the officer says, "I receive many phone calls for (postings) in two police stations. Such sub-inspectors should be asked if Madhya Pradesh police has stopped paying salary to them. Why this craving? Why go to these places? How many criminals were arrested by you?....Many inspectors call me up to make a request to let them spend their time in police lines instead of sending them to Dehat and Kotwali police station. I feel ashamed of them."
 On being asked by the officer during the conversation to express their opinions another police officer is heard saying, "Sir, you should have come here 20 years back. Then you and myself would have worked together to improve the situation in Bhind. But the sub-inspectors and police stations in charge of the new generation are thoroughly corrupt. You are not their boss. Their bosses are MLA, MP and journalists. They have pledged their police uniform. They have become businessmen."
 The conversation ends with the first officer  saying he didn't expect that everyone would become honest overnight but they should work hard while keeping the priorities of the police department in their mind. "No goonda even if he is a politician should have courage to sit in the chair in front of a police station in charge," he said.
 When contacted Nagendra Singh said, "I have been transferred now. I would not like to make any comment on this."
 Deputy inspector general of police, Morena range Rajesh Hingankar said, "I have not received any complaint regarding any such audio clip."

 He was found guilty of six offences of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour relating to four men between 2010 and 2016.

Hong Kong police on Monday banned an upcoming vigil marking the Tiananmen crackdown anniversary citing the coronavirus pandemic, the first time the gathering has been halted in three decades.
 The candlelight June 4 vigil usually attracts huge crowds and is the only place on Chinese soil where such a major commemoration of the anniversary is still allowed.
 Last year's gathering was especially large and came just a week before seven months of pro-democracy protests and clashes exploded onto the city's streets, sparked initially by a plan to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland.
 But police rejected permission for this year's rally saying it would "constitute a major threat to the life and health of the general public", according to a letter of objection to organisers obtained by AFP.
 Hong Kong has managed to keep the virus mostly in check, with just over 1,000 infections and four deaths. Bars, restaurants, gyms and cinemas have largely reopened in recent weeks.
 In the last two days five local infections were reported, breaking nearly two weeks of zero tallies.
 Organisers accused police of using the virus as an excuse to ban the rally.
 "I don't see why the government finds political rallies unacceptable while it gave green lights to resumption of schools and other services ranging from catering, karaoke to swimming pools," said Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance which has organised every vigil since 1990.
 The alliance called on residents to instead light a candle at 8pm on Thursday and observe one minute of silence wherever they can.
 "If we are not allowed to light a candle at a rally, we will let the candles be lit across the city," Lee said.
 Lee also vowed that the alliance would continue to chant the slogan "end one- party rule" during the commemoration despite Beijing's recently announced plans to impose a law criminalising acts of subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign interference.
 Beijing says the law -- which will bypass Hong Kong's legislature -- is needed to tackle "terrorism" and "separatism".
 Opponents fear it will bring mainland-style political oppression to a business hub supposedly guaranteed freedoms and autonomy for 50 years after its 1997 handover to China by Britain.
 The 1989 Tiananmen crackdown occurred when China's leaders sent tanks and troops to quell student protesters calling for democracy and an end to corruption.
 Hundreds were killed, with some estimates suggesting that more than 1,000 perished.
 Three decades on, it remains one of the most sensitive subjects in mainland China and any mention of it is strictly censored.
 But in Hong Kong the memory of what happened is kept alive.
 The annual vigils swelled before the 1997 handover to China and have become especially charged in recent years as many Hong Kongers chafe under Beijing's rule.
 This year's anniversary is likely to coincide with Hong Kong's pro-government stacked legislature voting for a law banning insults to China's national anthem.

The elements for a traditional 200-inning starter are present, but in every other case, teams have at least dozens of innings of eyewitness track record to help them make that decision. As of May 15, prospects can give data of post-quarantine workouts to all 30 clubs via MLB's Prospect Link database.
 In a draft where no prospect has the full spring's worth of performance that clubs are used to having before they make a selection, teams are leaning more on data to stand in for those in-person looks. Some college pitchers are perceived to be slipping from where scouts had them ranked since they throw sinking fastballs, while (all things being equal) most of the league now generally prefers Bitsko's style of high-efficiency, four-seam fastballs with lift. This type of pitch both causes more whiffs due to the deceptive "rise" to the pitch, particularly when thrown at the top of the strike zone, and also enhances the effectiveness of a curveball at the bottom of the zone. This dual upside gives some margin for error in the development of pitchers who are still years away from the big leagues.
 Right-handers Emerson Hancock of Georgia, Carmen Mlodzinski of South Carolina and Chris McMahon of Miami all throw two-seam or sinking fastballs and are predicted to go lower now than expected when the season was suspended. My latest mock draft has Bitsko being considered as high as eighth overall by San Diego, drawing interest from a number of teams in the middle of the first round including Philadelphia at 15th overall, and coveted by clubs picking in the 30s and 40s with extra picks and flexible bonus pools.

In difficult times, stories of random acts of kindness and warm gestures bring hope. This story of an 80-year-old coolie at Lucknow Railway Station is one of them. Mujibullah has been doing his bit to help migrant workers by carrying their luggage for free. His gesture has struck a chord with thousands.
 Even at his age, Mujibullah has been working 8-10 hours every day and can carry 50 kgs of weight. Calling it 'khidmat', he says he helps migrant workers with their luggage free of cost. He says this is his duty and this duty is very 'important'. Mujibullah is also helping by providing food and water to the passengers on trains. He believes he can earn money once things get better but for now he's volunteering to help.
 Several people have posted reactions about Mujibullah and appreciated the work he's doing.
 "This type of person is called real hero. They believe in only humanity," says an individual on Instagram. "Such people keep humanity alive!" says another. "Heartfelt. He does have a heart of gold," says a third.
   
   
 Several such stories about heroes who're going above and beyond to help others in this time of need have brought happiness to people. Humans of Bombay shared one such heartening story about Mumbai Police helping a lawyer get her broken prosthetic leg fixed after a tweet. The story tugged at people's heartstrings who wrote how 'humanity still exists'.

People returned to some of Thailand's famed sandy beaches Monday, keeping well apart but enjoying the outdoors, as authorities eased some coronavirus restrictions for the first time in more than two months.
 In Pattaya, visitors marvelled at the clarity of the turquoise-blue waters of the Gulf of Thailand, as pensioners eager for exercise promenaded along the beach.
 Social distancing rules still applied, with local authorities ordering beachgoers to stay at least a metre (three feet) apart.
 German expatriate Heidi Glemeau, was one of the first to take an early morning dip in the water, and couldn't believe how empty it was.
 "I couldn't resist the temptation," she told AFP. "It's become a paradise -- just like it was 30 years ago."
 Not all beaches were closed during the lockdown, and not all re-opened Monday.
 Phuket, in the south, is still off-limits, while sleepy Hua Hin remained open throughout.
 Thailand has been under various lockdown restrictions since mid-March, when authorities declared a state of emergency against the coronavirus -- shuttering malls, leisure centres and public spaces, including its famed beaches.
 But the number of new infections slowed in May, and on Monday cinemas as well as tattoo and massage parlours across the kingdom were given the green light to return to business.
 "I think it's been long enough," said Nutthawut Kanasup, 29, who waited for a foot massage at a downtown Bangkok spa.
 Student Prayos Plodchai, who had tickets for US blockbuster "Bloodshot", said he was not very confident about the hygiene standards at Central World mall's cinema.
 "But I'm willing to take the risk because I've been stuck at home for so long," the 19-year-old said.
 Official records show the kingdom escaped the worst of the disease relatively lightly, recording just over 3,000 infections and 57 deaths.
 Some experts, however, say a lack of testing may mask the true toll.
 Regardless, the exodus of foreigners and a ban on new arrivals hit the economy hard -- particularly as the country is so reliant on tourist dollars in resorts such as Pattaya.
 Tourism revenues dropped by 40 percent in the first three months of the year, and the government has warned the virus' impact on the second quarter will be more severe.
 A major tourist destination with an infamous nightlife and red-light district, Pattaya has turned into a virtual ghost town.
 Bars and clubs remain shuttered, however, and it is not clear when normal activity will resume.

Global markets kicked off June on a strong note, with the STOXX 600 recovering nearly 31% since March lows as hopes of COVID-19 vaccine, easing lockdowns and expectations of more stimulus helped improve risk appetite.

The impact of COVID-19 will only worsen these structural weaknesses. The Economic Commission for Africa has reported that between 300,000 and 3.3 million people could lose their lives if appropriate measures are not taken. There are several reasons for this level of high risk. These include the fact that 56% of urban dwellings are in overcrowded slums, 71% of Africa’s workforce is informally employed and cannot work from home and 40% of children on the continent are undernourished.

The specialist lists three factors as the main ones affected. The first would be the loss of muscle mass. Maintaining a strong musculature is necessary to protect and prevent joint stability, as well as reduce joint pain and prevent wear and tear, but with confinement there has been a loss of muscle mass and strength, and these losses can reach alarm levels and it is known by the term sarcopenia. The second factor, to highlight, would be the loss of bone mass (osteopenia), mainly due to the lack of physical activity and together with the decrease in hours of sun exposure, a fundamental aspect to be able to fix calcium to the bones. The third and last factor would be the decrease in aerobic capacity, understood as the decrease in maximum oxygen consumption (maximum VO2), an excellent indicator of a person's state of health and which decreases considerably with lack of physical activity. "Hence, on these first walks when we go out we feel more tired and fatigued, it costs us more to move and we gasp for a little walk or activity, compared to two months ago," adds this researcher.

Cricket Australia announced the international season last week, scheduled to begin from August 9. Star batsman Smith, someone who loves shadow batting as much as he loves being in the middle, surprisingly did not pick up a bat for the last two months due to the lockdown.
 Smith said he focussed on physical and mental fitness during the forced break. "I haven't touched a bat, really. A couple of little drills at home but that's about it. I've just tried to switch off from it a bit, which I don't do very often. I was just focusing on getting myself fit and strong and refreshing mentally," he said.
 England cricketers have also begun training in a bio-secure environment and Sri Lankan players to resume practice on Monday.
 Smith said it was a welcome break from the game after a gruelling 2019. "I've done a few master classes at home (with fans online) ... but other than that I really haven't picked up a cricket bat. "It's been a bit different but I'm sure in the long run it will probably be a good thing to freshen up after a pretty long year and a half since the World Cup and Ashes."
 The ongoing health crisis has adversely affected the financial condition of Cricket Australia, which has had to stand down more than 200 staff.
 With uncertainty around the T20 World Cup in October-November, it is banking heavily on the India Test series starting in December.
 There is a possibility that the Australian cricket team's support staff will be down-sized for cost-cutting and Smith said he is prepared for that. "They all have a role to play, particularly as the game has evolved and got more professional. We've got people in different areas of expertise to help the team prepare and get ready to play. If that happens it will take some adjusting," Smith said.
 "If that's the case, it'll be about guys being able to help each other out as well, particularly senior players being able to take a bit of time off your own game and help someone else out at training or something like that," he added.

Litchfield resident Quinten ‘Lefty’ Hoien Baseball is a 2020 inductee into the West Central Baseball Hall of Fame. Joining him in the Class of 2020 is Harlen “Butch” Steen of Raymond, and Rudy Vigil of Willmar.
 The game for which Hoien has been recognized has been a part of him his whole life, even when he was a child.
 Nicknamed “Lefty,” Hoien was born in Twin Valley, Minnesota. He can’t remember when he started playing baseball, but he has been around the sport since he was born.
 “My father was a baseball player,” Hoien said. “I had access to baseball all the time while I was in high school, even in grade school and junior high. I grew up around the game.”
 That lifelong attraction to the game took him many places and earned Hoien recognition, including the announcement by the Kandiyohi County Historical Society that Hoien is one of three Class of 2020 inductees to the West Central Minnesota Baseball Hall of Fame.
 Hoien, now a Litchfield resident, said that baseball was big in the Twin Valley community when he was growing up. He played with the American Legion team in the spring and then in the summer league as those were the only times that he could play given it’s impossible to play year-round.
 But in 1952, when graduation time came around for Hoien, he wasn’t sure what he wanted to do. His parents wanted him to go to college, but he didn’t know if he wanted to make that commitment — until one night his father received a phone call from a neighboring community to see if Hoien wanted to play a baseball game for them against a semi-pro team. They wanted him to play center field. Hoien accepted and said he got his first taste of what good ballplayers are supposed to be like.
 “We got beat, but we were competing with them,” Hoien said. “The next day I got a telephone call from a person I did not know whatsoever, but he introduced himself as the catcher from the Detroit Lakes semi-pro team. He was wondering if I was going to go to school. I said, ‘I want to go to school, I haven’t decided where.’ He said, ‘I’m a coach at Eastern Arizona. I would like for you to come to Eastern and play baseball.’ That was a godsend.”
 Eastern Arizona offered him a scholarship, which he couldn’t refuse.
 “I questioned my own abilities,” he said. “I didn’t know if I was good enough to play here.”
 At the end of the summer, after Hoien went through all the paperwork, the coach, Bruce Larson, offered him a ride to Arizona and helped him get settled into his new environment.
 “We got to Arizona in the evening,” Hoien said. “He said, ‘Tomorrow morning, there will be a young gentleman and he’ll knock on the door. Let him in, because he’s going to be a good friend for you.’”
 The next day there was a knock at the door, and the person at the door was someone Hoien would call a friend for the next 60-plus years. Manuel “Poncho” Martinez was a year older than Hoien and taught him everything, Hoien said, from his culture, to the Eastern Arizona community, and a great deal about baseball.
 Larson told Hoien he was going to have to work for a spot on the team, which was a bit intimidating at first.
 “He didn’t tell me he was going to give me a spot,” Hoien said. “I’ll tell you, my eyes got about that big the first practice. There were so many ballplayers, and they were good ballplayers.”
 The coach posted on the bulletin board every two days the players who made it to the next day. In the end, Hoien made the roster and played many games in many different places with Eastern Arizona.
 After two years at Eastern, Hoien graduated and decided to follow his friend Martinez to Colorado State, or what is now Northern Colorado.
 “Once again I caught a break,” Hoien said. “The coach from Northern, he said, ‘We’ve lost our center fielder, graduated, and the center fielder job is open.’ I’ve been corresponding with Poncho, he says, ‘Come up here, it’s a good school. You can compete with these people up here. You’ll be fine.’ Well, I firmly believed in everything that he had told me, because everything he said we were doing, we were doing.”
 This was now Division I baseball, playing against the top schools in the nation. The team had a good season, eventually reaching the 1955 College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska.
 The first game was against the University of Southern California, the top- ranked team in the country at the time.
 “I don’t know if any one of the players on my team figured that out.” Hoien said. “We never gave it any thought except, ‘Hey, we’re playing in a big stadium.’”
 Colorado State beat the Trojans 2-1. Hoien said his biggest regret from that game was not keeping the ball that he caught for the final out. Instead, he flipped it to the umpire, which was instinct to him.
 Colorado State lost its next two games, but the experience was something that Hoien will never forget.
 “Warming up for the game, you wonder how it’s going to be,” Hoien said. “We didn’t know anything about the team we were going to play, a lot of questions in our mind. Once you got on the field, once the game starts, those things leave you. Then you get back to the way you trained, the way you practiced. It’s still baseball. They still have to throw strikes, you still have to catch the ball, then it’s a game. That’s the enjoyable part. Especially with a good bunch of people. Our team was very close, a great bunch of guys.”
 When his college years were over, Hoien began his teaching career in Belgrade, where he also coached the football team. He stayed there for six years before moving to Litchfield and coaching baseball. In 1981, he received the R.M. Farrish Award from the American Legion, which recognizes outstanding service to District 7 American Legion baseball.
 Hoien also continued to play amateur baseball for 25 years. First he played for the Belgrade Redmen, and then with the Dassel-Cokato Saints for many years, where most of the players were other coaches. One of the players was his brother, Mick Hoien, who coached baseball at Dassel-Cokato High School. The Hoiens coached against each other often, but it was always friendly competition, Lefty said.
 Hoien and the Saints played in five state amateur tournaments, winning the title in 1968 and finishing runners-up in 1972. He appreciates what town ball does for people who just love to play baseball and want to keep playing.
 “It still gives you an opportunity to play the game,” he said. “People have played town ball for the love of the game.”
 In 2002, Hoien was inducted into the Northern Colorado Hall of Fame. It was surprising to him, he said, and he appreciated that the school recognized him. But it was all the more worth seeing the familiar faces that were there with him during the ceremony.
 “I was excited,” Hoien said. “It was great for us to get together as a group of men coming from all different parts of the United States and reliving ball games. It was a great time.”
 With his induction into the West Central Hall of Fame, Hoien reflected on how much baseball has impacted his life, how it has been at the center of everything that he has learned throughout the years, and how it has helped him maintain friendships he never imagined.
 “In my fondest dreams I never gave it any thought of being inducted into anything more,” Hoien said. “This game is a complete surprise. (Baseball) has opened a lot of doors for me. ... I’m always learning, it’s a never-ending process. That’s what athletics does.”
