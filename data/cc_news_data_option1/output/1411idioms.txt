Mouffe’s adoption of Hall’s idea of “learning the lessons of Thatcherism” is also problematic, in that it overlooks the very different processes by which the left and right struggle and organise.128 Historically, bourgeois hegemony has been able to secure the transformation of “common sense” before it seized state power. While Thatcherites could lay the foundations of a new set of values and vision of society through a top-down process before they achieved government, it is not possible for the left to replicate this strategy.129 As we have seen, Gramsci’s vision of socialism involves a “cathartic process” through which subaltern groups might emerge from passivity to become the architects of a new epoch.130 This involves a type of radical cultural transformation that cannot be created “from above”. This, as Davidson notes, would be to conflate bourgeois and proletarian hegemony, “as if the process of a ‘passive revolution’ were simply mirror-reversed in the socialist project”.131 Constructing a hegemonic project “from below” involves a process of political activity and organisation through which the “philosophy of praxis” and “good sense” undertake an “intellectual and moral reform” in order to overcome the conservative inertia of existing “common sense”.132 As Sotiris points out, the framework of populism developed by Laclau and Mouffe sees “effective populist movements as the result of crucial semantic shifts and articulation of new discourses, rather than as forms of organising or programme elaboration”.133 In other words, the primary focus of the “populist left” tends towards adopting better marketing and “electoral communication strategies” for its slogans. A similar awareness of the power of discourse is visible in the approach of many recent social movements, including Extinction Rebellion, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, and others. It is not to detract from the urgency of the concrete demands of these movements to suggest that they are also significant for building the capacity among ever-wider layers of the oppressed and the exploited to take collective action in their own interests.

"Bob" was educated and began his coal mining career in Thomas. During World War II, he served with the United States Air Force in the South Pacific and upon his return continued his education, graduating from West Virginia University in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration. Bob was a proud member of the WVU Basketball Team in 1943-1944. After graduation he was employed by the United States Bureau of Mines working in research on the gasification of coal. Bob also attended the Executive Program at Columbia University Graduate School of Business in New York. He joined Bethlehem Mines Corporation in 1953 as a laborer at the former Century Mine 101 and was subsequently promoted to a number of operating and supervisory positions, including Mine Foreman at the Century Mine, Production Engineer at Barrackville Mine 41, Assistant Superintendent at Idamay Mine 44, Chief Inspector, General Superintendent and Manager of the Marion-Barbour Division. Bob retired from Bethlehem Dec. 31, 1982, with thirty year's service. Since retirement, Bob has remained active in the coal industry by forming a consulting firm, Jeran Mining, Inc. He was inducted into the West Virginia Coal Hall of Fame on May 10, 2003. He was a former member of WV Society of Professional Engineers, the Mine Inspectors Institute of America, the West Virginia University Varsity Club, and twice president of the Central West Virginia Coal Mining Institute. He was a member of the Board of Directors of the Central West Virginia Coal Mining Institute, West Virginia Safety Council, Mine Inspector Institute of America, West Virginia Surface Mining and Reclamation Association, West Virginia Coal Development Authority, Buckhannon Chamber of Commerce and West Virginia Chamber of Commerce. As a member of the West Virginia Chamber, he served on the none-man executive committee, Land Use and Natural Resources Committee and Personnel Resource Committee. Bob served as a director of Bank One of Buckhannon. He was a member of the Board of Trustees at West Virginia Wesleyan College, serving on the Academic Council, Audit Committee, Investment Committee, and Building and Grounds Committee. In honoring Mr. Jeran's wishes, he will be cremated. Bob was Catholic by faith. A Memorial Catholic Mass will be announced at a later date.

A few words need also to be said about Turgut’s comment on the “CHP, the party they believed to be their own”. Turkey was a one-party state until 1946 and that party, founded by Atatürk himself, was the CHP. Party and state were one and the same, in terms of personnel and official ideology. Around 1970, the party repositioned itself on the centre-left, adopting somewhat progressive and somewhat anti-imperialist verbiage (in fact confusing secularist Westernisation with progress and nationalism with anti-imperialism) without jettisoning any of its basic tenets, and continuing to be a staunch upholder of the Kemalist state, Turkish nationalism and secularism. Naturally, since the rise of Erdoğan’s AKP and its predecessor, the Virtue Party, from the mid-1990s, CHP has attempted to act as a bulwark against “the rise of Islam” (and, in class terms, against the rise of the great Muslim unwashed, the urban and provincial poor, who vote for the AKP). Equally naturally, CHP’s politics have corresponded exactly to those of the “middle class” I have been describing. This correspondence has been strikingly clear in every election since 2002. In all of the big cities, the CHP has won where the middle and upper classes live, and the AKP has won in all the poor and working class districts. (The single exception is the recent rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election, which has perhaps, finally, sounded the AKP’s death knell.) Absurdly, and unfortunately, the CHP is widely considered to be something of a “left” party, not only by its own voters, but also by most working people and the poor.

While some of the conditions producing crowd diseases were ameliorated in the most developed countries by the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a new danger, pandemic flu, was coming into focus. Flu epidemics were not unknown. One European outbreak in the 1550s may have killed as many as one in five inhabitants in England, before, again, wreaking havoc in the Americas.31 Now the threat returned with a vengeance. The prelude was the “Russian” flu outbreak of 1889, which began in Bukhara, in present day Uzbekistan, spreading first to St Petersburg in autumn and within eight weeks across Europe, reaching North America and Southern Africa. Over successive months it penetrated South America, then India, and finally Australia and New Zealand. “A very conservative estimate for first-wave mortality (1889-1890) in Europe posited that the number of deaths had been between 270,000 and 360,000”.32 This was simply a dress rehearsal. In spring 1918, as the First World War raged, soldiers began to fall ill with the flu. The disease soon became a pandemic, but, in its first wave, it led to few casualties and was overshadowed by the effects of the war. But the second wave of this “Spanish” flu, produced by a mutated strain of the virus, was devastating.33 Dehner writes:

An important turning point in this wave of agitations was the mass strike held in the health sector in 2010. Building on the success of this mobilisation, more protests were staged in 2011 and 2013, leading to a huge open-ended strike in November 2014.27 Later, trainee doctors struck for more than eight consecutive months—from late 2017 till the following summer—against their precarious social and economic conditions. This attracted solidarity from other health workers and led to a three-day national general strike in all hospitals in January 2018.

However, for the time being, they have been unable to achieve significant improvements in their living conditions, let alone to take control of production or conquer state power.
