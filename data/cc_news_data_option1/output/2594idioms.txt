The American Association has partnered with Vimeo to create www.aabaseball.tv for live league broadcasts and exclusive team video content. The new platform is subscription based, with a full-season pass costing $19.99 for the 2020 season. Monthly subscriptions are also available for $12.99 per month. With a subscription, fans will be able to stream every game of the 2020 season to their PC, Mac, Smart TV, tablet, or phone through the Apple and Android apps.
 "Our league leaders took a hard look at where we were and where we wanted to be in regards to technology and promoting our brand, and one of the first updates we needed to make was our streaming platform," said American Association Commissioner Joshua Schaub. "We are proud of the high-level quality of play on our fields and it was time to present our game broadcasts to fans in a highly professional manner as well."
 The 2020 American Association season sees six teams playing 60 games each in four locations. The Chicago Dogs, Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks, Milwaukee Milkmen and Sioux Falls Canaries will host games in a unique hub schedule. The St. Paul Saints will play home games in Sioux Falls, while the Winnipeg Goldeyes will base out of Fargo. The schedule allows for either or both teams to return to their home stadium should they be granted clearance by local health departments and municipal authorities. Six other teams suspended operations for the 2020 season due to local COVID-19 restrictions but will return for the 2021 season.
 "In a of summer of unknowns, without many of the activities people enjoy, we are excited to offer live professional baseball to the fans of America," said Schaub. "We set the price point low to give as many people as possible access to America's Pastime on www.aabaseball.tv and we think both our longtime fans and new audiences will be impressed with the product they see."

As the school year steadily approaches, those in charge of athletics are still unsure of the appropriate course of action.
 Though the Florida High School Athletic Association is still tentatively scheduled to begin its fall sports season on July 27, its Fall Sports Task Force met virtually via Zoom on Wednesday morning to discuss any needed changes.
 Citing a rise in cases across the state, the task force voted, 8-7, to propose moving the start of the season back to any time from Aug. 10 to Aug. 22 — roughly when the school year is set to begin.
 However, the proposal must now be approved by the FHSAA Board of Directors before it can become official.
 “The recommended vote is to start August 10, definitely no earlier than that,” FHSAA Board President-elect Lauren Otero said during the meeting.
 FHSAA Associate Executive Director for Athletic Services Justin Harrison proposed four options for a return date.
 The first option, which was a return from July 27 to Aug. 8, was shot down by the task force. Options two through four, however, are still in play.
 The second option would see a return any time from Aug. 10 — Aug. 22. The third option would have athletes begin their fall season any time from Aug. 24 — Sept. 5. The fourth option would have a window of return from Sept. 7 to beyond.
 Under this proposal, principals must commit each sport to a return date, though it would be allowed for some sports to return at different times.
 Once an option is selected there will be a minimum two-week tryout and practice period, pushing the start of the regular season back to Sept. 14 at the earliest — meaning Kickoff Classics and the first four regular season games for football would be canceled or postponed. But it won’t just be football that will be affected, as cross country, golf, swimming and volleyball were all scheduled to begin the regular season on Aug. 17.
 As of now, the end of the regular season has not changed and the FHSAA has not decided on whether or not it will host a state series this year, saying it’s “too premature” to lean one way or another.
 Due to the varying degrees of severity in the coronavirus outbreak throughout the state, the FHSAA is recommending that schools are paired in classifications based on when they return to sports. Though there can be more than one classification for each option, there must be more than 100 schools per classification.
 The issue of protocols for officials were also discussed, with Mid Coast Officials Association President John Scarpino noting that officials are typically in the at-risk category of over 65 years old.
 “Realistically, the guys are going to officiate at their comfort level,” he said. “So if the guys aren’t comfortable stepping on the field or the basketball court, they’re not gonna do it. That could be an issue as we move forward with COVID-19.”
 Between deciding on an official start date to monitoring the spread of the virus throughout the state and coming up for a plan that works for everyone, there are countless hurdles for the FHSAA to overcome in its return to play.
 Only time will tell if those hurdles are too much to overcome.

Wash basil being careful not to bruise the leaves. Drain thoroughly so that the dish will not become watery. Put basil in a blender or food processor and chop along with garlic, nuts, and a pinch of salt. Slowly add already grated cheese. Continue to chop in the blender until an even paste has generated. You may need to use your spatula to get some particles off the walls of the blender. Slowly add the olive oil mix until a creamy consistency has been achieved.

Speaking of foods this was in an era of time when any and everything was prepared from scratch from home and I was blessed to have been born into a family of great cooks and the family reunion was a prime time and place for each of them to bring one or more of their very best dishes to eat. Therefore, it was safe to say that after the noon meal the afternoon moved along at a leisurely pace since all were full and ready to let the great foods settle a while. Although the pace was slow that day never really ever stopped. There were lawn games like badminton or croquet and that usually was played by the teens that were there. The men would choose up pairs and play horseshoe for almost the entire day. It seemed to me that most all of the men of my youth were better than average at tossing those shoes and as they played they talked about what all was going on around the neighborhood and area and even the world. (Many issues were solved around those horseshoe pits.)

On the side of what he's doing, [as an activist] he is one of the people who have inspired me to speak out about the things happening and take time to learn what I can do to help. Today the climate is very different and being able to say, I may not have the biggest platform, but if I decide to stay silent just because I don't believe I have a big platform I become complicit to the issues at hand and at the end of the day those issues affect me as a black woman. I can't just be silent. With him doing the work he's doing and his organization BLD Power, it has made me want to do more for my community and stand up for what is right, because at the end of the day there are issues black people face - microaggressions, violence, murder, just because of the color of our skin. I am grateful to know him and to have seen him talk about those things in real life. He is definitely one person I can go to if I have questions.
