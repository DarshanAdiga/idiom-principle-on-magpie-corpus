“Without access to testing there is no way for us to really get ahead and have an understanding of how the virus is spreading,” said Shreela Sharma, PhD, professor of epidemiology and disease control at UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. “It's really very much a citizen science approach to drive public health decision making.”
 Sharma said she and her team were looking for a way to track COVID-19 symptoms in Texas, when they found the work of Andrew Chan, MD, MPH, a physician- epidemiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
 “We're researching other apps out there, other technology out there and just given the rigor of this app in terms of privacy of data that is important in this day and age, especially if you're tracking health-related information, and then the other side of it being that it just takes literally one to three minutes and every day takes me maybe 20 seconds to complete, it makes it really easy,” Sharma said. “Ease of information is another piece that's important. I think those two were our critical criteria that allow for ease of dissemination of the app and to collect the data on a regular basis.”
 Chan worked with scientists and developers on mobile technology to improve health. He said COVID-19 changed the focus of that research for the time being.
 “We developed with our partners in the U.K. (United Kingdom) an app which basically anybody in the public can download to their phone, which allows them to report how they're feeling, if they feel well or if they feel sick, and also if they've been feeling sick, whether they've been evaluated for COVID-19,” Chan said. “We can then use this information to deliver back in real-time information about how communities are currently feeling and whether there might be potential hotspots of the disease.”

Moodys Investors Service on Tuesday slashed Indias growth forecast to 0.2% for the 2020 calendar year from the earlier projection of 2.5 % released in March. Stating that the economic costs of shutdown of the global economy are accumulating rapidly, Moodys in its Global Macro Outlook 2020-21 (April 2020 Update) projected that all G-20 advanced economies would contract by 5.8% in 2020. In November last year, before the emergence of the coronavirus, the rating agency was expecting the global economy to grow by 2.6% this year. Among the emerging economies in G-20, Moodys projected India to grow at 0.2% in 2020 and 6.2% in 2021. This compares to 5.3% growth clocked in 2019. India extended a nationwide lockdown to 40 days from 21 days, but relaxed restrictions in rural areas to facilitate agricultural harvesting in the second half of April. The country has determined that many of these areas are free of the virus. India also plans a phased opening of different regions while continuing to carry out identification and contract tracing, Moodys said. Late last month, the government had announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus package comprising free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor and cash dole to poor women and elderly. A second package, aimed at industries, is said to be in the works and is likely to be announced shortly. China is projected to grow by 1% in 2020 and 7.1% in 2021, as against 6.1% in 2019. Moodys in the report titled Global recession is deepening rapidly as restrictions exact high economic cost, said there are significant downside risks to its growth forecasts in the event that coronavirus pandemic is not contained and lockdowns have to be reinstated. India, China and Indonesia are the only 3 G-20 countries which are projected to grow in 2020, while the others will see a contraction, according to the report. The US economy is projected to contract by 5.7%, the UK by 7%, Italy by 8.2%, Japan by 6.5% and France by 6.3%. Moodys said the economic costs of the coronavirus crisis amid the near shutdown of the global economy are accumulating rapidly. Even with a gradual recovery, 2021 real GDP in most advanced economies is expected to be below pre-coronavirus levels. The rating agency further said that it expects Brent spot price to average USD 35 per barrel and WTI spot to average USD 30 a barrel for this year. Oil prices will likely move up in 2021 as demand recovers along with economic growth. For 2021, we forecast Brent to average USD 45 per barrel and WTI to average USD 40 per barrel, it said.

A Picayune company was picked to serve as monitor for the cleanup of the aftermath of a massive tornado that ripped through Jones County on Easter.
 Debris Tech was hired as the monitor after a three-person committee — Supervisor Phil Dickerson, Chief Administrative Officer Danielle Ashley and Chief Financial Officer Charles Miller — evaluated the four companies that bid on the project. The cost of each was roughly the same, Ashley said, though each of the proposals were presented in different forms in multi-page binders.
 Debris Tech proposed a rate of $229 per hour while True North out of Arlington, Texas put its bid in the form of a total estimate of $144,630. Debris Tech won the bid over True North by one point in a scoring system the committee used to rate the bidders, Dickerson said. The other two bids were from Florida companies.
 “We evaluated each company … on their experience, their ability to do the job, etc.,” he said in a special meeting that was moved to the county courtroom to allow for social distancing.
 Ashley added, “They have a lot of experience in Mississippi. They have a good reputation.”
 The monitoring company is hired to oversee the company that gets the contract to remove the debris.
 “They make sure that they aren’t halfway filling up a truck,” Ashley said. “It eliminates abuse. At the end of the day, we want to be able to show FEMA that everything was on the up-and-up.”
 The first of two long-track tornadoes that struck the area on Easter evening was the widest in state history (2.25 miles) and hit hundreds of homes and businesses in Jones, Covington and Jefferson Davis counties. President Donald Trump declared the three counties as federal disaster areas. That means residents, business owners and government agencies qualify for financial assistance from FEMA. When that happens, there is the potential for overcharging, as happened in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
 “The monitor serves as our eyes and ears,” Ashley said.
 Having everything “above board” helps ensure that the county will be reimbursed for expenses it incurs because of the storms, she said.
 “I understand it's important to the people to get this (debris) moved,” Supervisor Larry Dykes said. “We’re moving as quick as we can, slowly and surely, so we don’t cost the taxpayers.”
 The next step to getting the cleanup started is the selection of a site or sites to dump the debris. Sealed bids are being taken by the Board of Supervisors through 2 p.m. Friday.
 Sites have to be at least 30 acres within a 30-mile radius of the damaged area, which goes from Oak Bowery in the south part of the county to the Matthews Community in the northwest corner of the county. There are other requirements, too, and sites have to be approved by the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality.
 The board’s next regular meeting will be at 9:30 a.m. Monday in the circuit courtroom of the Jones County courthouse in Ellisville.
