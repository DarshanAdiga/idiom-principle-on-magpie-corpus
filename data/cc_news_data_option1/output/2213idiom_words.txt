While the world in lockdown was fixated with Instagram live, we chose to abandon the IG-Live platform and instead decided to do a multi-person audition using a different platform, streamed onto our MTV Roadies Facebook page. While the world was slowly turning its back on Facebook, we chose to do the opposite, with some clever tweaks and adapts – and the result is apparent in the millions of organic views that the online episodes have generated.

For smooth bowel movement and healthy digestive tract, it is necessary to perform at least thirty minutes of exercise daily and also regularly eat fibre rich fruits like oranges, papaya, muskmelon, etc. Needless to say, it is very important, to keep the body high on fluids and always stay hydrated for smooth digestion.

Every week I'm usually on several conference calls developing strategy with the MTV team both for MTV Roadies as well as for the broader channel. I'm also working with the Vh1 Supersonic team on our music festival in February 2021, which we fully expect will go ahead. We have tremendous faith in our government, doctors and scientists and we know we'll find a way to have our festival, under guidelines by the government of course, by February 2021. I'm anticipating that we will need to adapt and make several changes to the way we conduct the festival, but as a team, we're crossing our fingers and plowing on with our plans.
