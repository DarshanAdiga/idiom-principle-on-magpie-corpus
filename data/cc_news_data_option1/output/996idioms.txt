Is IndusInd Bank interested in investing in YES Bank?We have given a clarification last evening. In a letter addressed to all shareholders which we have sent to the exchanges, we have very clearly said that we have neither considered nor evaluated, especially at management and board level, any such sort of a proposition. These are absolutely unfounded rumours based on a passing remark relating to the fact that it could be a good investment but as far as IndusInd is concerned, I repeat, we have neither evaluated nor considered any such investment. We understand that there are other private sector banks which have shown keen interest to invest in YES Bank. Why are you not inclined to do that and what are the chances that you may change your mind tomorrow?No, each bank takes its own decisions. What is happening now is all speculation. The plan is unfolding and the final truth will come out when RBI and SBI announce those plans. At this stage, it is all speculation. As far as we are concerned, our stance is pretty clear. Promoters of IndusInd Bank, the Hinduja family, if they decide to do that, we do not know yet, would that be a separate transaction that has got nothing to do with IndusInd Bank? I just want a clarity on this issue?They are best placed to answer that question themselves but of course, there is a complete arm’s length sort of a situation between the promoters and what they do and the bank. There are concerns about a broader slowdown which had hit IndusInd Bank last year and continues to haunt the stock price right now. There are concerns on your exposure to vehicle finance and to a lot of HNI accounts. Is it business as usual or you are feeling the heat of economic slowdown and the impact of coronavirus?We have clarified more than once over the past few quarters that people talk about these sort of books; one is vehicle finance, microfinance and the diamond financing. As far as vehicle financing is concerned, our performance has stuck out very nicely. Our performance has been better than the industry, both on the growth side and also on the quality of the book side. The credit cost that we have seen on our vehicle finance has been extremely range- bound and well within the parameters that we have seen for almost 30 years of financing this particular book. The book is behaving nicely in the circumstances and the data that we have from rating agencies very clearly shows that we are far ahead of industry in terms of the quality of the loan book as well. The second one is microfinance, where occasionally things bubble up in media or there are rumours. In the first half of the year, we know that microfinance was slower because of the issues of floods in a few states and of course, that particular typhoon or cyclone in Odissa, the second half has come out very strongly, growth has returned into the microfinance sector, collections are in the vicinity of 99.6- 99.7%. The credit cost has remained range bound within 30-35-40 bps which is pretty good for this sort of industry. The concerns were more around growth and of course, one or two states where we have no presence at all up in the northeast and things like that. That book is now going apace and the quality is pretty decent. Finally, the odd sort of things that pops up now on the diamond financing side, that book is as close to being as pristine as possible in the lending space and in spite of all that has happened even in China or Hong Kong, we have found that we do not have a single day’s overdue in that book. That book is one of our prized books and has been extremely well managed because of the quality of the customers that we have. This is to put at rest any sort of speculation on the quality of these three books, they have behaved pretty nicely. Otherwise, I would say that it is business as usual as far as we are concerned, both on the lending side and also on the liability side. On deferment of the AT1 bonds, do you think that sent the wrong signal to the markets?No not at all. You only have to look at declared balance sheets to see the position of our capital adequacy. In Q3, we showed a capital adequacy of 15.4% and the market knows that there is subscription to preference issuances that happened during the merger with Bharat Financial and that will clearly take it well beyond 16%. We have a threshold and some sort of informal guidance from the board that you should keep that threshold on capital adequacy and it is a very high threshold. If you look at the position that we have today, we have enough and more capital to generate a loan book in the vicinity of 20% or more for the next two years. So, it is not that you need capital but we have this threshold issue and we keep topping up now and then just to meet the threshold which is the informal guidance from the board. We thought we will raise money to keep that threshold. The market changed and we do not need the capital. We said we will defer it and wait for better circumstances to do that top up. We are retaining most of our profit and that generates almost 70% of the capital that we require every year. Capital formation within the bank is also pretty strong. We are strongly capital adequate. We do not need capital for the next two years but we have internal comfort to sort of keep a threshold on capital adequacy. In terms of the kind of fall we have seen in banks across the board, and the value proposition at IndusInd, as an investor, are you looking at anything else in the market?In terms of my personal investments or investments for the institution? As an institution.In turbulent times, you stay put as an individual investor. As far as we are concerned, as an institution we remain focussed on our organic growth plans. We have finished a planning cycle which ends in March and we are about to present to our board the next five year plan which we call planning cycle five. So, we have remained focussed. We stand on strong capital adequacy. We stand on good liquidity and remain focussed on organic growth. Is there any change in the committed amount of capital from the Hinduja Family?Yes, the City Bank pledge. The clarification letter came from the holding company. We have given it to the exchanges. They are better placed to speak about it but it is a three-year-old facility. There is no additional pledge or anything there. It is a very small percentage, probably used to raise liquidity for other activities. But they have to give that clarification. We are hearing that NHAI has pulled out about Rs 15,000 crore of deposits after the Maharashtra order. Is that correct?No there is no truth in that. That is another rumour flowing out. There is not truth in that. When do you see relief for bond holders?Which bond holder are you talking about? A particular institution or generally on bond holders? Given the shakeup that we have seen post the AT-1 deferment and the uncertainty there, there has been a lot of nervousness in the market.That is very instance specific issue. I do not think that is the larger issue of AT1s, etc. But let us see how that issue gets resolved. One is of course the technical solutions and the rights that are embedded in AT-1 bonds; the other is the interest of the investors. I think this is a test case.
