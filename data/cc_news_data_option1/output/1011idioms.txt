CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon signed a two-year state budget Thursday while vetoing 19 sections that included across-the-board spending cuts to address falling revenue from the state's coal, oil and natural gas industries. Gordon's approval of the fiscal 2021-22 budget in the late afternoon gave the House and Senate just seven hours — until the five- week legislative session ended at midnight — to override any of his line-item vetoes. Focused on other last-minute legislation, they hadn't taken up any of the vetoes by evening. One budget area Gordon vetoed sought to save $1 million a year by telling the governor to eliminate unspecified positions. Cuts should be more specific and targeted, Gordon said in his veto letter to Senate President Drew Perkins, R-Casper. Gordon similarly vetoed an across-the-board, 1% cut for agency budgets. “I believe we must be thoughtful in our decisions to reduce state spending, examining programs and services strategically instead of implementing hasty across-the-board reductions, which fail to consider any resulting ramifications,” Gordon wrote. Gordon vetoed a $5 increase in driver's licenses and vehicle registration fees to update the state's driver-records system. “This provision legislates from within the budget, and even for a project I wholeheartedly support I am impelled to exercise my veto authority,” Gordon wrote. The Wyoming Department of Transportation should use its own funds to work on updating the system for the time being, he wrote. Another veto involved an effort to raise more money to cremate and bury people without survivors able to cover those expenses, which Gordon said was noble but needed to be enacted through separate legislation. Other areas vetoed would study hospital viability,...

Traditionally among all these segments sun dried process of dehydration was the major segment in terms of usage by food manufacturers followed by hot air dried process. However due to the introduction of new technology spray dried is expected to account for largest share in terms of market revenue contribution, followed by freeze dried during the forecast period. Vacuum dried segment is expected to show a consistent growth as compared to others. Limited usage in food products is expected to be the restraining factor for the growth of vacuum dried technology in dehydrated food market in the near future.

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) — Fifty-one people were killed and dozens more injured when a lone gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch last year. New Zealanders will commemorate those who died on the anniversary of the mass killing Sunday. Three people whose lives were forever altered that day say it has prompted changes in their career aspirations, living situations and in the way that others perceive them. Aya Al-Umari Aya’s older brother Hussein, 35, was killed in the attack at the Al Noor mosque —- When she first heard there had been a shooting at the mosque, Aya Al-Umari rushed to her brother’s house and then to the Christchurch Hospital, hoping to find out something, anything, about him. She was confronted with an overwhelming scene. Children were crying. Adults were covered with blood. Nothing was comprehensible. She spotted a policewoman, who calmed her down, told her to go home and promised to update her hourly. The kindness of that officer and other officers has inspired Al-Umari to consider a career change. Currently a credit analyst at a bank, she hopes to join the police force and work on financial crimes. “I think, going through this, it really shifts your perspective in life. And by life, it’s everything from A to Z,” she says. “So from family time, going about your day, to career. All of these have shifted.” These days, she is learning self-defense techniques through martial arts courses and says no matter how busy she finds herself, she always makes sure to spend time with her parents. And she never stops thinking about Hussein, who was her only sibling. She carries a photo of the two of them and takes selfies of it when she visits different places around the world, like when she completed the hajj pilgrimage in August. She...

PHOENIX (AP) — Democrats in the Arizona House opposed to the expansion of school vouchers failed to block a Republican-backed measure that would slightly increase the reach of the state's current program. The House approved the expansion on a party-line vote Thursday after an hours-long debate. It now goes to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey for his expected signature since the Senate has already approved the measure. The proposal is billed as a permanent fix to an issue that cropped up last year when the new state schools chief discovered that a handful of children on the Navajo Nation were illegally using vouchers to attend a private school in New Mexico. Democrats said this year's measure is far more broad than a temporary fix passed last year. That proposal just allowed seven children attending the Hilltop Christian School to continue going there this school year. Opponents, including leaders of a group that blocked a statewide expansion of the private school voucher program called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, have called the measure a slippery slope that would allow a massive expansion. They noted the proposal allows any child living on a reservation to attend a private school in a nearby state if it's within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of the border, not just the children already attending that school. But Republicans dismissed that, saying they were just making the fix permanent. “This is something that’s already in place that we temporarily did last year. We’re just extending it,” GOP Rep.

Underreacting and overreacting are both dangerous when it comes to having concerns about the new coronavirus, U.S. Rep. Michael Cloud said Thursday.
 “We could artificially tax health care systems to where we create other issues for other people in danger,” he said, adding, “It is important for us to realize it is a serious issue.”
 “So the whole question is, how do we have the appropriate response?” he asked. “Setting that gauge will be different for any community.”
 Cloud spoke about the virus as concerns and precautionary measures about the new coronavirus continue to increase at the local and global level. There have not yet been any confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, in Victoria County.
 During a recent House Oversight Committee hearing about the virus, Cloud asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, to compare the virus to the seasonal flu as well as SARS and H1N1.
 Fauci said COVID-19 has spread far more than SARS, and is at a minimum, 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. As of Thursday afternoon, there are 1,215 cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, though the numbers are rapidly changing.
 Cloud asked Fauci whether COVID-19 is less lethal than H1N1 or SARS, to which Fauci replied, “No, absolutely not.” Fauci said the H1N1 pandemic was “even less lethal than the seasonal flu.”
 Cloud said he was trying to help the American people know where to appropriately set their gauge of concern.
 “I think you set the gauge at this is a really serious problem that we have to take seriously,” Fauci replied.
 On Thursday, Cloud said he thinks that for most residents, it is important to take the appropriate precautions – such as washing hands and staying home if they feel sick – while also being careful not to overreact and unnecessarily burden health care workers and emergency responders.
 “For example, we’ve had people who had no symptoms call 911 wanting an ambulance to escort them to a test,” he said. “We need to be careful to be wise in our interactions.”
 Despite all the precaution, Cloud said, everyone should be prepared for the virus to affect their community.
 “Certainly an elbow bump might be better than handshakes at this point,” he laughed.
 In Victoria, numerous events have been canceled and precautionary measures have been taken despite no confirmed cases locally. On Thursday, it was announced that the University of Houston-Victoria’s Victoria and Katy campuses would begin their spring breaks early at noon Thursday.
 Cloud said residents should look to their public health departments and community leaders for the most up-to-date direction and guidance about the best way to proceed with events and activities.
 He said at the end of the day, people should do their best to be mindful and not panic unnecessarily.
 “We will get through this and eventually get back to some sense of normalcy,” he said.

Some Victoria nursing homes and hospitals have gone into lockdown in an attempt to protect patients and residents from the new coronavirus.
 “Our residents’ safety is of the utmost importance,” said Angela Murray, administrator for Twin Pines North Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. “Although there are no confirmed cases in Victoria or our facility, we’re taking precautions issued by the (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to protect our residents.”
 Thursday, Dr. John McNeil, Victoria County’s public health authority said there were “absolutely” no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus or its resulting disease, COVID-19, in Victoria County.
 He also said Crossroads residents should not panic and instead trust medical officials who are continually monitoring the virus’ spread.
 “We are going to be very transparent. We’re all on the same page,” he said.
 As of Thursday morning, 23 cases of the virus had been confirmed in Texas, including some in Montgomery, Fort Bend and Harris counties, which lie about a 100 miles away from Victoria County, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission.
 But even before cases are reported in a community, nursing homes should begin “aggressive visitor restrictions,” according to a CDC advisory.
 Nursing home residents and older adults, who often have underlying medical conditions, are most at risk for being infected, according to the CDC.
 At noon, both Victoria Twin Pines nursing home locations began full lockdown procedures to restrict access to residents, Murray said.
 The lockdowns mean only key personnel will be allowed into the homes, and family members and friends will not be allowed access, said Murray.
 But residents will be allowed to leave the home with family members, another Twin Pines official said.
 At Sodalis Victoria, a nursing home that caters to residents with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia or other types of memory problems, residents will be required to remain on community grounds, except for medical care.
 “Upon returning and as a precaution, residents will be screened, asked to wash their hands and we will sanitize their walkers and wheelchairs,” according to a Sodalis document about the restrictions.
 Although no visitors will be allowed at Sodalis locations, staff will schedule digital video phone calls between residents and their loved ones.
 Additionally, package deliveries will be made outside the building where a staff member will accept them.
 Inside the Sodalis nursing home, caretakers are taking precautions to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.
 Table linens have been removed, and single-use condiments are being offered.
 Beverages will be offered from cans or bottles.
 And all staff members will have their temperatures taken each day.
 Any staff with fevers or cold-like symptoms will not be allowed to work until they are symptom-free.
 They will also be asked to isolate themselves for 14 days at home and get a doctor’s release before returning to work.
 Similar protective procedures have been put into place at Citizens Medical Center and DeTar Hospital Navarro in Victoria.
 At DeTar, hospital officials are following CDC guidelines and have educated staff about proper protective gear use among other procedures, said Judith Barefield, DeTar spokeswoman.
 “Patient and visitor safety will continue to be our first priority, just as it always is,” she said.
 At Citizens Medical Center, routine visitation is strongly discouraged, said Jennifer McDaniel, Citizens spokeswoman.
 Visitors who are younger than 18 will not be permitted. Anyone who is ill is “strongly discouraged” from entering.
 “We are encouraging limited visitation at this time,” she said.
 Patients in isolation because of infection will be allowed one visitor per day.
 “We are encouraging visitors to contact patients via telephone instead of visiting,” she said.
 Although Brittany Burgess, Victoria County epidemiologist, described the national spread of the new coronavirus as a “rapidly evolving situation,” she also said residents should remain cognizant but calm.
 As of Thursday, she said it was still too soon to guess at the spread of the disease in the Crossroads.
 “Don’t stop living your life,” she said.

Silver said the league and the players association will have to continue determining “what makes sense here without compromising anyone's safety and I think it's frankly too early to tell," Silver said.
 The regular season was to go until April 15, with the playoffs scheduled to start on April 18 and the NBA Finals to begin June 4. The NBA's 30-day plan was decided on the same day that Major League Soccer announced a 30-day shutdown in response to the virus, that Major League Baseball said opening day would be delayed at least two weeks and the NHL began what it called a “pause" in its season.
 “This literally changes hour-by-hour in terms of what we know," Silver said.
 Silver was also asked if the season may be over. “Of course it's possible," Silver said. “I just don't know more at this point."
 Meanwhile, NBA great and longtime commentator Charles Barkley was not on the “Inside The NBA” broadcast Tuesday night and revealed that he is self- quarantining for 48 hours because he has not felt well since a recent trip to New York.

 For now, NBA players have been told to remain in their home market through at least Monday — some teams such as the Toronto Raptors that are self- quarantining would, in theory, need to remain place for longer — and speak to a team physician or team athletic trainer once daily. Group workouts and practices are not being permitted yet.

The brief also notes that the “numerous and amorphous factors” that immigration officials can use to deny people means that virtually anybody can be turned away—not just applicants with lower incomes. For instance, a professional earning an annual salary of $76,000 would miss the income threshold needed to be heavily favored for approval—because he has a wife at home with four kids. Likelihood for denial is even higher if they also have run-of-the-mill financial liabilities such as mortgages, car loans or student debt. And skilled immigrants who want to sponsor an aging or disabled family member may think twice about coming to America, as their loved ones are more likely to be deemed ineligible.

Tyler Maye always knew he would come home one day.
   
 After helping the Southeastern Community College men's basketball team to the Region XI championship in the 2018-19 season, the Farmville, North Carolina, native did just that -- he packed his bags and went home.
   
 Well, at least within two hours of home.
   
 Maye, a 6-foot-2 junior, is a shooting guard for the North Carolina A&T; men's basketball team this season. He helped the Aggies reach a game for the regular-season title in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, scoring 19 points in a loss to North Carolina Central.
   
 The Aggies opened up play in the conference tournament on Wednesday night in Norfolk, Virginia, looking to punch their ticket to the NCAA Tournament.
   
 Either way, Maye is back home doing what he does best -- playing basketball at a high level.
   
 "I came out here to be closer to home and continue playing basketball at the Division I level," said Maye, who played for VCU before transferring to SCC. "Things are going very good. We started off the year with a few ups and downs and had a couple stretches where we weren't playing well. But we got things back together and now things are going very good of late."
   
 Maye, who is well-known for his mid-range game, has been a boost in the arm for the Aggies, mostly coming off the bench to provide offense.
   
 In 22 minutes a game, Maye is averaging 8 points, 2 rebounds, 1.3 steals and 1.3 assists per game while shooting 45.4 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from 3-point range.
   
 Maye also has provided solid defense for the Aggies, something he worked on last year under the tutelage of SCC head coach Lorenzo Watkins.
   
 "I am going out and playing defense and making plays. That's my role here and I'm trying to take advantage of it," Maye said. "Coach Zo told us to always play hard and when you get an opportunity, take advantage of it. He taught us to seize the moment and have fun. College is supposed to be the best time of your life, so go out and take advantage of it and have fun. That's what I'm trying to do."
   
 Maye helped SCC have one of its best seasons in recent memory last year. He is trying to do the same at North Carolina A&T; while learning new teammates, a new coach and a new system.
   
 "Last year was a great experience at SCC. I got acclimated to it as the year went on and we had a great season," Maye said. "Right now we are just taking it one game at a time and trying to play the right way. We want to get to the NCAA Tournament and make a run."

Larry Rothwachs, a rabbi in Teaneck, New Jersey, walked into the meeting Wednesday night between local Jewish leaders and health officials with one set of ideas about how his community should respond to the coronavirus.
 He walked out later that evening certain of another one: that drastically curtailing Jewish traditions and rules is essential to stem the spread of the deadly disease.
 "I don't think everybody was on the same page coming in. I was not on the page I am at right now," Rothwachs, the spiritual leader of Beth Aaron Synagogue, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. "By the time that we left, I do think there was an overwhelming consensus."
 The Rabbinical Council of Bergen County -- which consists of rabbis representing 28 local Orthodox synagogues and one Jewish nursing home across the heavily Jewish suburban area -- spelled out that consensus in a letter early Thursday to local Jews that issued one stunning decree after another.
 All synagogues would shut down. No prayer gatherings would take place, even in people's homes. No Shabbat meals should be shared. Burials would be kept to small groups of family members, and no one should gather to comfort mourners.
 "I do not recall anything of this nature taking place," said Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University. "This kind of organized statement by a central body, telling every Orthodox synagogue to shut down, that I do not recall seeing."
 The rabbinical council's decision reflects the growing urgency to contain the spread of the virus, which so far has killed thousands of people around the world and on Thursday claimed its first victim in New Jersey.
 Earlier this week, many congregations scaled down or canceled Purim celebrations, but synagogues were still discussing making relatively small- scale changes such as switching from buffets to served food. Now, with policy changes aimed at curbing the epidemic growing more sweeping by the minute, the conversation has turned to whether to close entirely, and when.
 In Bergen County, one of several nodes of a cluster of documented coronavirus cases among Jews in the New York City area, the rabbis at Wednesday's meeting were convinced by what they learned from local government representatives, the Teaneck Department of Health and physicians from three local hospitals.
 "We heard over 45 minutes of expert medical testimony from all of the local medical centers as to what they are experiencing on the ground," Rothwachs said. "This is not what we have heard until now. This is not what we are reading in the papers. And this is not what we are seeing, so we were given a window into what's really going on, and that's it, you can't argue with the facts."
 The council's letter made clear that the decision had not come easily for the Orthodox Jewish leaders, whose communities are structured in some ways around Jewish laws that require, for example, at least 10 people to say certain prayers, such as the one for mourners. Curtailing those practices means that local Jews will not be able to fulfill some religious requirements.
 "It is with a very heavy heart that we are suspending so many of the most crucial routines of our daily lives and lifecycle moments," the council wrote in its Thursday letter. "We do this only because of the compelling nature of our circumstance and the decisive medical testimonies that are consistent with CDC recommendations."
 In a statement released Thursday afternoon, the council's president, Rabbi Kenneth Schiowitz, said the decision to bring local communal Jewish activity to a halt "was not taken lightly."
 "We have one goal, to slow the spread of the virus and to save lives," he said. "Preserving life is a paramount value in Judaism and that value is our guide at this point."
 The decision is drawing praise from near and far. Tablet Magazine, an online journal about the Jewish world, said in an editorial that the rabbis' decision illustrated "what communal responsibility looks like."
 And Teaneck Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin said he hoped to see more actions such as the one taken by the rabbinical group.
 "More and more data is coming out -- they call it flattening the curve -- the more that we can quarantine and keep people from spreading the virus is our best chance right now of containing it," Hameeduddin told JTA. "And I think that as every day goes on where we are going on more and more presumptive positives, it's time to take measures to close as many gatherings as possible."
 But for some in the community, the closure is coming too late to bring much comfort. Bryce Gruber lives in Manhattan but four of her five children were until recently students at Yeshivat He'Atid, an Orthodox day school in Teaneck.
 Gruber, who recently decamped with her family to their house in the Catskills in an effort to avoid the coronavirus, said she had been contacting school administrators daily for a month to encourage them to close down. The school announced its closure Wednesday.
 "I am grateful that it's happening and I just wish it happened when there was still time to save lives," Gruber said. "There's already a dead guy in [Bergen County] and I keep wondering, did that guy really have to die?"
 Meanwhile, Rothwatchs said that he and other rabbis were trying their best to urge necessary precautions without adding to communal panic.
 "We are trying our best to be reassuring and to remind everybody that the sun will shine again, and this too shall pass," he said. "But right now the clear message that we are getting from the local medical community is that they cannot do this without us and that we must help them slow things down."
