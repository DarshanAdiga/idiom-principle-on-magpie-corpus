ANKARA, Turkey (AP) — The death toll in last week’s Aegean Sea earthquake rose to 116 on Wednesday as rescuers in the Turkish city of Izmir finished searching buildings that collapsed in the quake.All but two of the victims were killed in Izmir, Turkey’s third-largest city. Two teenagers died on the Greek island of Samos, which lies south of the epicenter of Friday’s earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey registered the quake’s magnitude at 7.0, although other agencies recorded it as less severe.Mehmet Gulluoglu, head of Turkey’s Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency, said search and rescue operations had been completed at 17 buildings that fell in Izmir. The rescue operation has been roaring at full tilt since Friday, pulling 107 survivors from the rubble.Of the 1,035 people injured in the quake, 137 remained hospitalized on Wednesday, the agency added. Following a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pledged not to give up until the final person was recovered. Rescuers' spirits were raised Tuesday when they pulled a 3-year-old girl from the wreckage of her family home 91 hours after the quake.The tremors were felt across western Turkey, including in Istanbul, as well as in the Greek capital of Athens. Some 1,700 aftershocks followed, 45 of which were greater than 4.0 magnitude.In Izmir, the quake reduced buildings to rubble or saw floors pancake in on themselves. Authorities have detained nine people, including contractors, for questioning over the collapse of six of the buildings.Turkey has a mix of older buildings and new buildings make of cheap or illegal construction that do not withstand earthquakes well. Regulations have been tightened to strengthen or demolish older buildings, and urban renewal is underway in Turkish cities, but experts say it is not happening fast enough.The country sits on top of two major fault lines and earthquakes are frequent.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

For his 45th documentary feature Frederick Wiseman trains his lens on his native Boston to record all things municipal unfolding in the cement encased corridors of Gerhard Kallmann's infamous Brutalist facade. The retrospective of how we operate and function in the Hub is an engrossing four-and-half-hour watch (yes, you heard that right) that amazingly goes by in a blip and serves as something of an eerie -- and taunting -- time capsule. Shot during 2018 and 2019, one segment has Mayor Marty Walsh and authorities preparing for the Wold Champion Red Sox Duck Boat celebration. Later we see fans chanting "Mookie, Mookie, Mookie." Betts famously left us in 2019 and recently performed his heroics in the 2020 World Series for that team we vanquished in 2018 (the L.A. Dodgers), and all that Wiseman's camera captures, strangely feels from another era as the city bustles in pre-COVID normalcy -- one can only imagine what a 2020-2021 version of "City Hall" might look like.
 Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for Entertainment Headlines and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.
 The Government Center delve unfolds in a series of chapter-esque meanders between the micro and macro with plenty of shots of Boston's iconic skyline and landmarks to root you. The rendering should make plenty of Beantowners proud and Walsh, seemingly ever aware of the camera, comes off crisp, progressive and inclusive -- a shining illumination that may pose something of an extra hurdle for upcoming challenger Michelle Wu and others. In Wiseman's classic observant, cinema verite style (fly-on-the-wall) there are several long takes of municipal proceedings such as the budget review where presenters effusively tout the investment in infrastructure as a win-win because it not only betters the community, but also makes the city's debt more appealing to bond investors. It's a cut-and-dry matter that under Wiseman's eye is more interesting and accessible than it sounds, but "City Hall' is most affecting when following the day-to-day operations of front liners, namely the 311 help center workers trying to iron out neighborhood issues or city magistrates mitigating parking tickets -- an anxious expecting father who parked in front of a hydrant and an incredulous old-schooler who didn't know there was resident parking along Congress Street -- and then there are those out in the community removing trash and providing subsidized veterinary care.
 What's truly amazing to note too is that Wiseman, at the age of 90, is still cranking out documentaries on a near annual basis and does all the editing to boot. For those not familiar with the works of the Academy Award honored documentarian, a law professor at BU and Brandeis before picking up the camera, they're slice of life exposes that quietly drink in their subjects without question, preface or prod the way you might get from a Michael Moore ("Roger & Me," or "Fahrenheit 9/11") or Morgan Spurlock ("Super Size Me"). The result conjures an uncanny sense of intimacy; there's no barrier, you are organically and viscerally part of the scene. "City Hall" in scope and focus feels like a natural addition to the the director's unofficial community series that began with "Aspen" (1991) and includes "Belfast, Maine" (1999)" and "Jackson Heights" (2015). Must see Wiseman films in my not-so-humble opinion are "Boxing Gym" (2010) and his controversial first film, "Titicut Follies" (1967) about the Bridgewater State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, which, because of its graphic nature, was banned from being shown in Massachusetts until the early 1990s.
 The most moving and telling scenes in "City Hall" are those steeped in earnest reveals and communal conflict. Talking to veterans afflicted by addiction and PTSD, Walsh shares candidly his dark days as an alcoholic. The connection both onscreen and in the room is immediate and palpable, something that doesn't quite register as much when Walsh underscores his Irish heritage as a bridge to a Latino community. Then there's the Thanksgiving feast for those challenged by Down syndrome and similar arresting disorders where Walsh and crew dutifully serve expectant diners and cap it all off with dancing. Wiseman never lets his lens sway you, but if you don't have a bittersweet bump inside you, you probably didn't flinch when Old Yeller died. The big rub in the film comes during a community outreach meeting run by a predominately Asian coalition of businessmen seeking to institute a recreational cannabis facility in a predominately Black and brown section of Dorchester. The two sides talk at each other, the rhetoric's tinged with the annoyance of not being heard and there's the clear fear of being taken advantage of, with the city and the Massachusetts Canabis Control Commission -- who are not in the room -- taking the brunt of the shots. It's a telling back and forth that raises the question of equitable economic development and how to earnestly empower a community in the process without gutting them.
 One of the things that makes Wiseman's films so captivating is the sense of cadence and human rhythm he imbues them with. "Boxing Gym" and his 2009 ballet troupe portrait "La danse" are driven by repetition and pursuit of form. In "City Hall" there are mesmerizing long takes of mattresses and barbecue grills being obliterated and compacted by a garbage truck's compressor and long spindly tree limbs are methodically pulled in and consumed by a restless wood shredder -- activities quite mundane and everyday, that in Wiseman's purview magically become hypnotic wonderments. Also too, Wiseman's longtime collaborator, cinematographer John Davey artfully finds Escher-esque motifs and reflections within reflections amid our familiar facades. His upward angled framings cut aesthetic portraits of old Scollay Square and the bland Saltonstall building in ways one might not have imagined possible. "City Hall" in the end, is a dutiful reflection of who we are, where we came from and a piquant insider look into the vast municipal neural net that keeps us humming as a community.

But there was this previous history of lithium. And then lithium ... is used in all sorts of other things, too, that have nothing to do with the health industry. But its fortunes as a product in the health industry take a nosedive when a compound of lithium is used as the basis for a salt substitute that ends up, people believe, causing heart problems and even several deaths. And so there's a warning sent out by the AMA and then eventually FDA that these salt substitutes — "take them off the market. This is a dangerous drug." And so lithium's emergence in psychiatry emerges against the background of two relevant facts: One, it has a reputation [all of a sudden] for being dangerous and, two, it's not going to make a pharmaceutical company very much money, because they can't patent it. ... I think there are a lot of people who say it's a very good drug. And there are some people who still take lithium. The problem with lithium [for drugmakers] is that it wasn't profitable.

The Gunners ran out 1-0 winners thanks to a Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang penalty, with the defeat compounding United's worst start to a top-flight season since David Moyes' doomed tenure in 2013-14.
 The Red Devils are currently languishing in the bottom half of the table, nine points behind pacesetters and defending champions Liverpool having played a game less.
 Solskjaer has so far failed to build on the platform of a third-place Premier League finish in 2019-20, with his side unable to maintain their impressive post-lockdown form at the start of the new campaign.
 The Norwegian endured a similar downturn in results when he was handed a permanent contract in March of last year, having initially overseen a revival of fortunes as interim head coach.
 Ince thinks United officials jumped the gun by handing Solskjaer a three-year deal, and that teams are now confident of picking up points against the Red Devils both at home and away.
 “They've been inconsistent for a while now - even before Ole took over," the former United midfielder told _Ladbrokes_. "Then they went on that great run and he got the job. It was hard not to give him the job after that run. I do think the board panicked though.
 “All the fans were singing his name, ordering the club to give him the job and they did. I think they should've waited until the end of the season. Let him have it as interim manager until the end of the season then see who's out there, who the best man is for the job.
 “I'm not saying Ole's not the best man for the job, and getting that team last season into third place was a great achievement. But I look at United now compared to when I played...
 “We had a presence. Teams were frightened of us. We already had teams beat before we walked out onto the pitch. Whether it was home or away, teams were frightened of Manchester United. I don't see that now.

Maggie Nurrenbern won the Missouri House District 15 seat in the Nov. 3, election, based on uncertified return results from the Secretary of State's Office and Clay County Election Board. The Democrat took in 58% of the unofficial vote county over Steve West, a Republican. The unofficial count has 18,211 votes cast in this district, which represents Gladstone and Kansas City North.
 “More than anything, being at the polls, I was truly humbled by all the support,” she said. “In the fall, before COVID, I went canvassing door to door and probably knocked on 1,000 doors. Then I turned to calling people. I listened to people’s concerns.”
 Nurrenbern said she is honored to have gained the support of Republicans and independents.
 “I know I gained support from those folks who normally vote Republican,” she said. “I believe the margin of win comes partly from the other side of aisle. I keep that in mind as I believe in person over party and I truly believe that is how our community voted today. I am thrilled to earn their support in these partisan times. It proves to me that we all are aiming for the best interest of Gladstone and Kansas City North.”
 Nurrenbern said she would like to be part of a statewide comprehensive COVID-19 recovery plan effort while in office.
 “I plan to work across the aisle,” she said. “One of my strengths is as a coalition builder. We have a tough road ahead of us.”

 Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey fended off a challenge from Republican Kevin O'Connor. The 74-year-old Markey rebuffed a high-profile primary challenge from Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Kennedy III in September.
 In the state's 4th Congressional District, Democratic Newton City Councilor Jake Auchincloss is hoping to become the newest member of the state's all- Democratic congressional delegation by defeating Republican Julie Hall. The open seat is currently held by Kennedy, who opted not to seek reelection after deciding to challenge Markey.
 Voters also weighed the fate of two questions on the ballot.
 The first would expand the state's "Right to Repair" law by giving car owners and independent auto shops greater access to data related to vehicle maintenance and repair.
 Car repair shops and auto parts suppliers said the measure would guarantee car owners access to the repair information needed to bring their cars to auto shops as vehicles become more computerized. Automakers cast the question as a data grab by third parties who want to gather personal vehicle information.
 The second question would make major changes to the way ballots are cast and tallied in future elections in Massachusetts by introducing ranked choice voting.
 Under that system, voters would be given the option of ranking candidates in order of their preference -- one for their top choice, two for their second choice, and so on.
 If no candidate receives a majority of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes would be eliminated. Voters who ranked the eliminated candidate as their first choice would have their votes counted instead for their second choice. The process repeats until one candidate receives a majority of the vote and wins.
 Republican Gov. Charlie Baker is among the opponents of ranked choice voting, calling it complicated and costly. Polls suggested a close race between the "yes" and "no" camps.
 Four of the state's remaining eight Democratic House incumbents are facing Republican challengers.
 Rep. Jim McGovern, who represents the state's 2nd Congressional District, is hoping to fend off GOP challenger Tracy Lovvorn, while 5th Congressional District Rep. Katherine Clark is trying to defeat a challenge from Republican Caroline Colarusso. Former presidential candidate Rep. Seth Moulton, who represents the 6th Congressional District, is hoping to defeat GOP challenger John Paul Moran, while Rep. William Keating, who represents the 9th Congressional District, is hoping to beat back a challenge from Republican Helen Brady and independent Michael Manley.
 Two Democratic incumbents -- 1st Congressional District Rep. Richard Neal and 3rd Congressional District Rep. Lori Trahan -- ran unopposed. Two others -- 7th Congressional District Rep. Ayanna Pressley and 8th Congressional District Rep. Stephen Lynch -- faced little-known independent challengers.

Clarks one the UK’s oldest shoe chains, has been rescued in a £100 million investment by Hong Kong-based private equity giant LionRock Capital.
 The deal will see the 195-year-old retailer enter into a form of administration known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), with Clarks insisting that no jobs will be lost and staff will continue to be paid.
 Bosses said the move will allow them to keep all 320 stores open with no rent on 60 sites.
 The remaining outlets will be switched to a turnover-based model, where rent is calculated on the amount of cash that goes through the tills, but the process must be voted through by landlords at a meeting next month.
 Coronavirus – Mon Nov 2, 2020 \- (Copyright PA Wire)
 Philip de Klerk, interim finance chief at Clarks, said: “In order to address the permanent shift in structural shopping behaviour as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the CVA is being launched out of absolute necessity.
 “The proposal to creditors outlines a combination of a reduction of rent and a move to rebase Clarks’ rental cost base through a turnover-based model that aligns to future performance and reflects the wider retail market.
