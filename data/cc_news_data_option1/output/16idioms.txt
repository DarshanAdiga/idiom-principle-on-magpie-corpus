Meanwhile, podcasting is going to play a slightly smaller part in the streaming wars as Apple and Spotify duke it out for dominance. Spotify acquired multiple podcast networks in 2019, as well as podcast creation technology Anchor, in an effort to own the space and transition to an “audio” company as opposed to a music streaming one. Apple is supposedly working on its own original podcast content, presumably to stave off Spotify. Similarly to video content, we can expect to hear more about new podcasts in the works and big names signing onto the various services.

While Electronic Arts hasn’t released official sales figures, “Fallen Order” was tracked as the No. 2 selling game of November, behind “Call of Duty” and ahead of “Pokémon Sword/Shield,” according to research firm the NPD Group. Where Asmussen’s team goes next, he says, isn’t “set in stone,” but there should be plenty of ideas to pull from. Before Respawn knew it was working on a “Star Wars” game — Electronic Arts possesses the license for the Lucasfilm/Disney brand — it had developed about 12 prototypes for a new intellectual property, one of which was properly demoed and shopped around the industry.
 And Asmussen is steadfast in the types of games he wants to direct. “I’m not a very good competitive player,” he says. “That’s when you see the worst of me, in terms of temper. I haven’t done it in so long because it was getting the better of me. It’s a frustrating experience for me. I don’t have the patience.”
 Miele cites Respawn’s ability to move quickly on an idea — to have, for instance, a rudimentary prototype up and running under Asmussen or to shift from a proper “Titanfall” project to put resources into what would become “Apex Legends” — as a trait she admires in Zampella’s teams and wants to spread among Electronic Arts’ other studios. “I feel really strongly about this,” she says, “and Vince has taught me a lot about this: rapid prototyping.”

K.C. prevailed in OT last year when Mahomes threw for 377 yards, and 28-20 on Sept. 22. Baltimore should also be wary of Buffalo, which limited Jackson to 40 yards rushing and 145 yards through the air in a 24-17 Ravens triumph on Dec. 8. Any defense facing the Ravens can make things tough for Jackson by taking away the edges and covering the tight ends, easier said than done.

Few actors have undergone more dramatic physical transformations onscreen than Robert De Niro. For 1980’s “Raging Bull,” the actor, then in his mid-30s, famously put on 20 pounds of muscle to play boxing champ Jake LaMotta; then, over the course of several weeks, he packed on 60 pounds of fat to play the fighter as a bloated, washed-up older man. The extreme gain temporarily wrecked his health, but for his trouble he won his second Oscar — and the awed respect of every actor on the planet.
 But not even the protean De Niro can reverse the relentless march of time.
 To portray the hitman Frank Sheeran in Martin Scorsese’s gangster epic “The Irishman” — a role that spans more than five decades, from Sheeran’s service in World War II to his death in 2003 — the 76-year-old De Niro was put into a time machine unlike any seen in film history. The effort involved years of collaborative work from some of the industry’s top visual-effects artists, costume designers, makeup artists and even sound editors. That work may not only yield a slew of Oscar nominations but, in a very real sense, change the face of acting forever.

When Kea Turner's 74-year-old grandmother checked into Virginia's Sentara Virginia Beach General Hospital with advanced lung cancer, she landed in the oncology unit where every patient was monitored by a bed alarm.      "Even if she would slightly roll over, it would go off," Turner said. Small movements - such as reaching for a tissue - would set off the alarm, as well. The beeping would go on for up to 10 minutes, Turner said, until a nurse arrived to shut it off.      Tens of thousands of alarms shriek, beep and buzz every day in every U.S. hospital. All sound urgent, but few require immediate attention or get it.      Intended to keep patients safe alerting nurses to potential problems, they also create a riot of disturbances for patients trying to heal and get some rest.      Nearly every machine in a hospital is now outfitted with an alarm - infusion pumps, ventilators, bedside monitors tracking blood pressure, heart activity and a drop in oxygen in the blood. Even beds are alarmed to detect movement that might portend a fall. The glut of noise means that the medical staff is less likely to respond.      Alarms have ranked as one of the top 10 health technological hazards every year since 2007, according to the research firm ECRI Institute. That could mean staffs were too swamped with alarms to notice a patient in distress or that the alarms were misconfigured. The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, warned the nation about the "frequent and persistent" problem of alarm safety in 2013. It now requires hospitals to create formal processes to tackle alarm system safety, but there is no national data on whether progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of false and unnecessary alarms.      The commission has estimated that of the thousands of alarms going off throughout a hospital every day, an estimated 85% to 99% do not require clinical intervention. Staff, facing widespread "alarm fatigue," can miss critical alerts, leading to patient deaths. Patients may get anxious about fluctuations in heart rate or blood pressure that are perfectly normal, the commission said.      And bed alarms, a recent arrival, can lead to immobility and dangerous loss of muscle mass when patients are terrified that any movement will set off the bleeps.      An 'epidemic of immobility'   In the past 30 years, the number of medical devices that generate alarms has risen from about 10 to nearly 40, said Priyanka Shah, a senior project engineer at ECRI Institute. A breathing ventilator alone can emit 30 to 40 different noises, she said.      In addition to triggering bed alarms, patients who move in bed may set off false alarms from pulse oximeters, which measure the oxygen in a patient's blood, or carbon dioxide monitors, which measure the level of the gas in someone's breath, she said.      Shah said she has seen hospitals reduce unneeded alarms, but doing so is "a constant work in progress."      'Cry wolf phenomenon'   Maria Cvach, an alarm expert and director of policy management and integration for Johns Hopkins Health System, found that on one step-down unit (a level below intensive care) in the hospital in 2006, an average of 350 alarms went off per patient per day, from the cardiac monitor alone.      She said no international standard exists for what these alarms sound like, so they vary by manufacturer and device. "It's really impossible for the staff to identify by sound everything that they hear," she said.      The flood of alarms creates a "cry wolf phenomenon," Cvach said. The alarms are "constantly calling for help. The staff look at them. They say that's just a false alarm - they may ignore the real alarm."      Bed alarms, for example, are meant to summon nurses so they can supervise patients to walk safely. But research has shown that the use of alarms doesn't prevent falls. Nursing staffs are often stretched thin and don't reach the bedside before a patient hits the ground.      Meanwhile, patients may feel immobilized at a time when even a few hundred steps per day could significantly improve their recovery. Immobility in the hospital can create other problems for patients, leaving them with often irreversible functional decline, research has shown.      Bed alarms have proliferated since 2008, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services declared hospital falls should "never" happen and stopped paying for injuries related to those falls. After that policy change, the odds of nurses using a bed alarm increased 2.3 times, according to a study led by Dr. Ronald Shorr, director of the Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. The alarms have become a standard feature in new hospital beds.      But Shorr noted that, in contrast, bed alarms are being removed from other settings: In 2017, CMS began discouraging their widespread use in nursing homes, arguing that audible bed or chair alarms may be considered a "restraint" if the resident "is afraid to move to avoid setting off the alarm."

Defending champions Bengaluru FC will lock horns with table- toppers FC Goa in their home match of the Indian Super League here on Friday, in what promises to be a cracker of a contest between two top sides of the tournament. FC Goa are currently leading the standings with 21 points from 10 games, while Bengaluru are at the third spot with 16 points from as many matches.FC Goa will look to extend their lead at the top while Bengaluru will look to cut the gap between them and Goa to two points. Bengaluru will have the upper hand in this fixture, having remained unbeaten in five matches against the Gaurs.We are going to face one of the best teams in the ISL. Its a big match for us but I think in the situation right now, the pressure is on them. We have five points between us. We can go to Bengaluru with confidence and if we can get three points, the gap will increase to eight points, said Goa assistant coach Jesus Tato. Goas task of turning their fortunes around against the Blues will be that much harder as they will be without coach Sergio Lobera on the touchline after he was sent off in their last game against Chennaiyin FC.A lot would depend on star striker Ferran Corominas, who has been in form lately. However, the Spanish striker hasnt really come to life when pitted against Juanan and Albert Serran. Another key player will be Brandon Fernandes who comes into the tie on the back of two goals in as many games and also has five assists to his name. In fact, no Indian has a better goal involvement number than the 25-year-old Goan.I think were doing well this season, quite similar to last season in the way that were missing our striker for nine games Miku. Were missing Onwu for 7 games. If you see the top scorers table, every team has a foreigner with goals, said Bengaluru coach Carles Cuadrat. In the end, football is about balance and we have been balanced enough to have been fighting for the playoffs in the last two seasons.Bengaluru have struggled this season against fellow play-off contenders, losing to ATK and Mumbai City FC, while they could only manage a draw against FC Goa in the reverse fixture. And come Friday, Cuadrat will be desperate to ensure they take everything at stake in a potential six- pointer.Set-pieces could play a big role in deciding the outcome of the match. Both teams make the most of offensive set-pieces -- FC Goas 11 out of 22 goals have come from dead-ball situations while six of Bengalurus 11 goals have stemmed from setpieces.

The move to bring in Asmussen was instrumental in changing the tenor of Respawn. Jason West, who recently joined “Fortnite” developer Epic Games, left Respawn for unspecified family issues in 2013, before the company had issued its first game. “Titanfall” in 2014 was largely dedicated to fine-tuning the first-person-shooter by creating a game that nimbly moved among different action styles.
 Talks with Asmussen began around that same time, before Respawn was acquired by its early investor Electronic Arts, and also before the industry would heavily pivot from single-player adventures to ongoing multiplayer games such as “Apex Legends,” a “Fortnite” competitor that lives as a live service with regular updates.
 “In 2014, I don’t think we were talking about single-player action-adventure games being an endangered species,” Asmussen says. “That’s something that happened while we were working on the game. There was a rise in game experiences that were service-based and people could continue playing over and over. But we stuck to our guns. This is the type of the game we were going to make. I think what happened is live service games expanded the market, but they weren’t taking away the players who wanted to play a single-player action-adventure.”

To further depict Sheeran’s transformation over the decades, costume designers Sandy Powell and Christopher Peterson developed scores of distinctive looks for Sheeran — 102 wardrobe changes in all — for each phase of his life. “We were tracking the way things changed through the decades with menswear,” Peterson says, “but we were also tracking character at the same time; Frank’s ascendance from a working-class teamster to one of the soldiers in the [crime] family and working his way up.”
 “You tell the passage of time with clothing,” says Powell, who has earned 14 Oscar nominations and three wins, most recently for last year’s “The Favourite.” “The gangsters in this film were a lot less flashy and ostentatious than in other movies Marty has done. That was the main brief, especially for Frank Sheeran, who has to be under the radar. A lot of it for him was about blending in and not standing out too much.”
 Even sound came into play. Oscar-winning sound mixer Tom Fleischman experimented extensively to figure out how to de-age De Niro’s voice. “It had to be very subtle,” Fleischman says. “I tried adjusting the pitch of his voice in ‘The Irishman’ to a couple of scenes in [De Niro’s 1982 film] ‘The King of Comedy,’ but it sounded a little bit like he was on helium. What [sound editor] Phil Stockton ended up doing eventually was going in and editing out a lot of the breaths and the grunts and guttural things that De Niro does with his voice, particularly as he’s gotten older. Then we just did a subtle pitch change. That worked very well.”
 As software improves and computing power increases, you can expect Hollywood to continue to push the envelope of de-aging. Earlier this year, with the sci- fi action film “Gemini Man,” director Ang Lee and his team used motion capture and other techniques to create a fully digital clone of 50-year-old Will Smith as he looked at 23. In what some may argue is a bridge too far, visual effects artists have even reached beyond the grave; the late actor Peter Cushing was digitally revived for 2016’s “Star Wars: Rogue One,” and outtakes from Carrie Fisher’s performance in “The Last Jedi” before her 2016 death were used as building blocks for “The Rise of Skywalker,” now in theaters. Meanwhile, James Dean, who died in 1955, is slated to be posthumously cast, via CGI, in an upcoming drama called “Finding Jack,” news that was widely greeted with dismay.
 But all the digital technology in the world will be for naught if it fails to preserve the analog soul of a performance. With “The Irishman,” what Helman is most proud of is that his work enabled Scorsese and his cast to shoot the film largely as they would have in the old days. For all of the countless hours of work that went into de-aging De Niro, Pesci and Pacino, he says, at the heart of it, the performances belong entirely to the actors.

“We will probably rebrand,” Zampella says. “We want to give it a new image. We want people to say, ‘This is a destination you can go and make new content.’ I think they’ve kind of gotten the branding that they are the support studio for DICE Stockholm. I think rebranding is important for showing people, ‘Hey! Come work here. We’re going to do some amazing things.’”
 The studio, he stresses, will be “separate from DICE Stockholm and separate from Respawn.”
 Says Zampella, “We do talk a lot, and the more we interact and learn from and teach each other, the better we’ll be. So there’s interaction, but as far as the games, they’re their own studio.”
 The move is being overseen by Laura Miele, who about 18 months ago took over as Electronic Arts’ chief studios officer. At a time when major console makers such as Sony and Microsoft are readying new systems for release in late 2020, and streaming and subscription services are providing more avenues to discover games, Miele says she is focused on broadening the Electronic Arts portfolio.
 “I think under Vince’s leadership the expectation is to have them work on and create a game on their own,” Miele says. “And I genuinely believe that he is going to help guide them creatively. He’s going to help them further fortify and build out their talent and their team. I think we’re going to have a really strong studio out of our Los Angeles location. They can go from a support team to a full stand-alone studio to create a new game offering.”

More than three times as many Republicans, many of whom are serving in the minority for the first time, decided to retire as Democrats. Twenty-one Republicans are retiring while six Democrats are heading for the exits.
 Nine lawmakers eight Republicans and one Democrat are leaving districts that could be competitive races in 2020, according to Inside Elections' race ratings. Their exits could be a problem for the parties looking to hold onto their seats, since incumbents tend to have advantages in name recognition and fundraising.
 Two North Carolina Republicans, Mark Walker and George Holding, decided to retire after a new congressional map made their districts more Democratic. Both lawmakers signaled they could run for office again in the future.
 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy noted at a Politico Playbook event last month that most of the Republicans retiring represent districts that President Donald Trump carried handily in 2016. Asked why the lawmakers are retiring, McCarthy said, "They've been here a long time."
 But the high number of retirements in solidly Republican districts has still raised questions about whether party veterans do not want to run on the same ballot as Trump, or have concluded the GOP will not win back the House in 2020. Republicans need a net gain of 18 seats to win the majority.
 Although the number of House retirements is above average so far, McCarthy noted the 2018 cycle saw an unusually high number of retirements, especially from lawmakers in competitive seats. Thirty-three lawmakers retired in the 2018 cycle, including 23 Republicans and 10 Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
 Some lawmakers decide to retire after spending time with their families during the holidays, so there could be more announcements as members of Congress return next week.
 Early in 2019, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put out a "retirement watch" list of 23 Republicans, most in districts the DCCC sees as potential pickup opportunities. So far, two of those lawmakers resigned and six announced their retirements.
 Michigan GOP Rep. Fred Upton is on the DCCC's watch list and is often mentioned as a potential retirement. Upton has not said whether he is running for reelection, although he has some time to announce his decision since the Michigan filing deadline is April 21.
 State deadlines to file to get on the ballot are often key factors in when members announce retirements. The early deadline last month in Texas explained in part why several Lone Star lawmakers announced their retirements, although Democrats cheered the "Texodus" as a sign that Texas Republicans did not believe they could win reelection.
 Filing deadlines in six other states have already passed Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, California, Ohio and North Carolina. Twenty-two states have filing deadlines between January and March, with 16 deadlines in March alone.

Third, resolved, to live with all my might, while I do live and never do anything, which I should be afraid to do, if it were the last hour of my life. These are the 6th and 7th of Edward’s resolutions. Ben Franklin said, “Procrastination is the enemy of success.” Abraham Lincoln said, “You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.” May I live life with a sense of urgency, knowing I don’t have the promise of tomorrow.
 Fourth, resolved, in narration’s never to speak anything but the pure and simple verity (truth). This was Edward’s 34th resolution. Speaking the truth in love (Eph. 4:15), sharing difficult truths in a gentle, kind, inoffensive way is not easy. Often that can be seen as disloyal, double-crossing, or subversive, but ignoring, condoning and overlooking the truth is wrong. The modern norm is to ‘spin’ the facts’ to fit a pre-determined narrative. May I present the truth as best as I can see it in a simple concise way without fear of whom it may offend.
