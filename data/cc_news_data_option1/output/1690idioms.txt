This is what isolating with my husband has come to. Nearly 30 years of marriage and we are fighting over dirty dog balls.      "I saw you throwing the ball for the dog outside this morning," I said to my husband. He was making himself some eggs while the dog lay panting on the floor.      "I did!" he said enthusiastically.      "You used the wrong ball," I said, walking past him to pet the panting dog.      "What do you mean?"      "You threw the green ball that has the treats inside," I said. "You're supposed to throw the yellow ball with no treats."      "What are you, the Fetch Police?" he said, as he flipped his omelette.      "No, but when you use the green ball, the treats inside get dirt and dog drool all over them."      He shook his head at me. "I don't understand. Don't the treats get dog drool all over them when the dog eats them?"      "Yes. But this is dirty dog drool."      "Is there such a thing as clean dog drool?" he wondered.      "I'm serious."      "I'm not going to stop using the green ball," he said defiantly. "It has a better bounce than the yellow ball and he likes to catch it on the bounce."      I glared at him.      "BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO WASH IT AND IT RUINS THE TREATS INSIDE!" I bellowed and stormed out of the room. Then I stopped, turned, and yelled over my shoulder. "AND THEY'RE ORGANIC!"      I shouldn't belittle the importance of this topic. The dog's favorite toy is the green rubber ball with the treats inside. When he pushes it across the floor with his nose, the treats will come out of a hole on each end. According to the dog toy people, this is supposed to be very intellectually stimulating for dogs, which would mean at least one member of the family was being intellectually stimulated while the other two-thirds of us were spending our time fighting over dog balls.      The problem was, when my husband threw the green ball outside, it would get filthy and the treats inside would also get filthy. Then he'd wash the ball and the treats inside would then be filthy and also wet, and they wouldn't come out when the dog pushed his ball across the floor. Then I'd have to fish out the dirty, wet treats from a little hole in the ball with my pinky finger and be really annoyed because, clearly, this is the most pressing issue on the planet right now.      The dog seemed completely unbothered by all this fuss. My husband and I, however, found that living together, 24/7, for over a month, was making even the littlest things, like dog balls, fightworthy. We were getting on each other's nerves and this was how it was showing up. It was clear our marriage was going to the dogs.      I stewed in the other room for a while but then realized that we could be stuck together for quite a bit longer and it would be best if we tried to be adults and worked out our ball issues.      "Hey honey, I'm sorry I barked at you about the dog balls," I said as I came back into the room.   "It's stupid. And really, I'm just thankful that with everything that's going on we have each other."      "And I'm thankful for you, too," he said and kissed me. "The dog has a lot to be thankful for, too," said my husband.      "What's that?" I said.      He smiled. "At least he has two balls."

A person with COVID-19 is asked to recall every individual with whom he or she has been in close contact — that is, within 6 feet for 15 minutes or more — while infectious.
 Then those individuals are notified about their possible exposure to COVID-19. They are advised to stay at home, maintain social distance from others and monitor themselves for symptoms. If they become ill, they’re asked to notify public health officials.
 Contact tracing is akin to throwing a lasso around the deadly and highly contagious novel coronavirus in an effort to minimize its spread.
 Importantly, no one’s privacy is compromised during the process. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s contact tracing principles state, “contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed to a patient with the infection. They are not told the identity of the patient who may have exposed them.”
 Contact tracing is a tried-and-true public health practice. And it will be essential to the safe reopening of our economy and society.
 In the absence of a vaccine, it is “really the big public health tool we have to control transmission of COVID-19,” said Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
 “We don’t know exactly how many people are still susceptible to COVID-19,” Watson said in an interview posted on the Hopkins website, “but we’re relatively confident that it’s a very large percentage of our population. So if we reopen and we don’t have the capacity to find each case, isolate them, then trace their contacts and put them in quarantine, this virus will start to circulate widely again in our communities.”
 And then, she said, “we will see again a big surge of cases, a surge of hospitalizations, and a surge of deaths.”
 That would be crushing.
 As we’ve said repeatedly, we believe contact tracing and more widespread testing are prerequisites to reopening Lancaster County’s economy. They are also factors the Wolf administration will consider when determining when counties will be permitted to reopen.
 So we’re immensely grateful to Lancaster city Mayor Danene Sorace for launching a contact tracing effort.
 The state health department will train city workers on how to make calls to those who may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus. As the CDC notes, these calls require excellent “interpersonal, cultural sensitivity, and interviewing skills.”
 The tracing specialists “will also call the contacts of any city resident who tests positive, whether or not the potentially exposed contact lives in Lancaster,” Hawkes reported.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden announced Thursday the four co-chairs of his vice presidential vetting team, starting the search for his running mate in earnest.
 Former Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd, Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Apple executive and longtime Biden aide Cynthia Hogan will serve as co-chairs on the committee.
 They’ll work with vetting teams led by former White House counsel Bob Bauer, campaign general counsel Dana Remus and former homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco to evaluate Biden’s options and collect information on each candidate to help him make his decision.
 “Selecting a vice presidential candidate is one of the most important decisions in a presidential campaign and no one knows this more than Joe Biden,” Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. “These four co-chairs reflect the strength and diversity of our party, and will provide tremendous insight and expertise to what will be a rigorous selection and vetting process.”
 Biden, a former vice president himself, has committed to picking a woman and has told donors his team is thinking about naming his running mate far in advance of the August Democratic convention.
 Biden has offered some hints about his thinking. He frequently says he’s looking for someone who’s “simpatico with where I want to take the country.” He’s also said he can easily name 12 to 15 women who meet his criteria but would likely seriously consider from six to 11 candidates. Biden has given no indication of whether he’ll look to the Senate, where he spent six terms, to governors or elsewhere.
 Those believed to be potential picks include some of Biden’s former primary opponents, such as Sens. Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, as well as some women outside Washington, including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

Konieczny, who helped Saint Joe win a Class 3A state title in 2017, has been sidelined for the past two seasons due to an injury. She said the injury, which turned out to be a torn labrum in her hip, was misdiagnosed for a year and a half.
 “It was a rough two years and I needed a change of scenery,” said Konieczny.
 Konieczny is still recovering from surgery on her hip in December. She will go to SFA as a graduate transfer and have three years of eligibility remaining starting next season.
 “I have family in Texas and my cousin brought up Stephen F. Austin when I was looking into schools,” said Konieczny. “I did my research. They have been very successful and have a good coaching staff and that sparked my interest. I feel comfortable going there.”
 Konieczny, a 5-9 guard, made 22 starts her freshman year in 2017-18 at Valpo. She averaged 5.9 points and 3.2 assists per game, which was fourth best in the conference. She ended up at VU after originally committing to Southern Methodist (University Park, near Dallas, Texas) after her sophomore year in high school. Konieczny changed schools when the coach at SMU retired.
 Konieczny’s younger brother, J.R., averaged 23.6 points per game this season as a junior for Saint Joseph and has verbally committed to Notre Dame.
 Konieczny scored 1,459 points in high school where she played two years at LaPorte and then her final two at Saint Joe. She averaged 14.4 points and 3.1 assists as a senior to earn a spot on the Indiana All-Star team. Coach Sydney Smallbone’s Indians went 26-2 and beat North Harrison, 57-49, in the state title tilt as Konieczny scored nine points.

Mortality is essentially a measure of the proportion of people diagnosed with a disease who go on to die, so having an accurate picture of the number of infections is key.
 Turkey has so far conducted about 948,000 COVID-19 tests, according to the data-gathering website worldmeters.info. That equates to a testing rate of about 11,200 people per million residents. By comparison, the U.S. has tested almost 19,000 people per million, and proactive Germany almost 25,000 per million.
 While Turkey's relatively low test rate might suggest even more impressive mortality figures, there are also concerns that the official death toll for the country -- the other half of the mortality equation -- could be a significant underestimate.
 The Turkish Medical Association, the country's largest doctors' union, has criticized the government for not using broader diagnostic criteria approved by the World Health Organization in its counting of COVID-19 deaths, saying it could be obscuring the "real dimensions of the problem."  
 Asked about those claims, an official at the Ministry of Health told CBS News that the broader WHO criteria are meant for countries with limited testing capacity and Turkey, the official said, has "extensive capacity to conduct tests" and "is acting in line with the international standards."
 The problem of questionable statistics may well be universal. The global death toll from COVID-19 could be as much as 60% higher than currently stated, according to a recent investigation by the Financial Times that cites data from 14 countries.

Original projections showed that at least 120,000 New Yorkers would contract the coronavirus without mitigation efforts, according to the governor. About 20,000 people have so far been hospitalized in the state due to the virus. Cuomo said the state's stay-at-home order and social distancing guidelines "changed reality," so that "100,000 fewer New Yorkers went into the hospital."
 Cuomo said Wednesday that the state does not have an "abstract plan" to reopen, only a factual plan that is "based on numbers." The governor cited his 12-step "un-PAUSE" plan that will allow certain areas of the state to reopen, granted they meet numerical criteria, such as hospitalization and transmission rates.
 As an early stage of the reopening process, the governor also announced Wednesday that some hospitals primarily in upstate New York will once again be allowed to perform elective surgeries.
 "Counties where we're still worried about a surge in the COVID beds we're not going to open it up to elective surgery until we know we're out of the woods," he said.

Now, the researchers state that by adding a new, artificial layer on top of the battery's Lithium anode (that features the element Tellurium), the problem of overall longevity can be overcome. In simple terms, a typical Li-S battery, through one charge cycle, sees certain chemical deposits on the negative terminal of the battery. This, in turn, breaks down the electrolyte — the battery's conducting material, and the two processes combined degrades the single cycle stamina, as well as the overall longevity of the battery. In fact, the researchers state that the deposits can even cause short circuits in the battery, and cause the cell to catch fire.

Lancaster Health Center has offered to partner with the city. The center has been doing contact tracing since March 30, when its first positive case of COVID-19 was confirmed in a patient. As of Wednesday afternoon, that nonprofit health center had contacted 511 households and employers.
 Sorace told Hawkes that she believes Lancaster city is serving as a “guinea pig” for the commonwealth. “We’ve been pushing for the ability to get going with this effort,” she said, “recognizing that time is of the essence.”
 Kudos to Sorace for pushing for permission to launch the city’s effort.
 It wasn’t a slam-dunk that such permission would be granted.
 As Hawkes reported, “Under state law, only a state-certified county or municipal health department has jurisdiction over contact tracing, neither of which Lancaster County has.”
 What the city does have, however, is a board of health, a panel of volunteers chaired by Dr. William Fife, a family physician with Penn Medicine Lancaster General Health. Levine approved the city’s request to provide contact tracing under the direction of that board.
 How Lancaster County might overcome its regrettable lack of a health department is unclear. (It’s a lack that costs us in countless ways.)
 Sorace told Hawkes the city’s initiative may serve as “a springboard” for countywide contact tracing. She noted that “this would be up to the (county) commissioners.”
 The commissioners, who recently hired a public health emergency adviser, must figure out how contact tracing can be done across the county.
 Because it remains uncertain just how the Wolf administration will ensure it's done across the commonwealth.
 As Spotlight PA reported this week, “local health departments and the state’s public health nurses — whose ranks have been decimated by years of budget cuts — are tasked with the work-intensive job” of contact tracing.
 Levine said she’ll circulate a contact tracing plan by Friday. As Spotlight PA reported, the state effort will be “led by public health nurses and also include county and municipal health departments, private health systems, and new hires and volunteers.”
 Krys Johnson, assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Temple University, told Spotlight PA previously that the state needs at least 2,000 contact tracers. The state health department employs just 131, though an additional 16 employees have been enlisted to assist with tracing. (Spotlight PA is an independent newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer; LNP Media Group is among its partners.)
 A "robust contact tracing effort is key to any economic recovery,” Sorace told Hawkes, “and has been highlighted as such in every plan at the national, state, and local level,” including a draft economic recovery plan prepared by the Economic Development Company of Lancaster County and the Lancaster Chamber.
 Said the city’s mayor: “The benefit of doing this will only improve if it is countywide, because the coronavirus has no sense of municipal boundaries.”
 Indeed. If Lancaster County is going to return to anything resembling normal life and business, it’s going to take the resources of the entire county. And the tenacity and sense of urgency that Mayor Sorace has exhibited.

Biden has offered some hints about his thinking. He frequently says he’s looking for someone who’s “simpatico with where I want to take the country.” He’s also said he can easily name 12 to 15 women who meet his criteria but would likely seriously consider from six to 11 candidates. Biden has given no indication of whether he’ll look to the Senate, where he spent six terms, to governors or elsewhere.

Thank you. The challenge that we face as a community is immense with devastating consequences for many. While we are confident that there will be a recovery, it will be some years before there is any sense of economic normalcy. Decisive action means we are well placed to protect the bank, our people and customers and well placed to continue investing for the long term. Understandably, there is a lot of focus on the level of preparedness in terms of credit provisions and capital, and it's reasonable to make comparisons with the past. However, each economic crisis is different in terms of transmission and impact.

Although there is no clear timeline as to when Instagram can delete an account after it has remained inactive, it is suggested that the user should log in at least once in a while even if he/she doesn't have anything to post. You can simply follow someone and like their photographs or comment on other people's activities. This way you can avoid your account from getting deleted. The easiest way to prevent your account from getting deleted is to log in every now and then - at least once is a month. Having said this, the more frequently you log in the better it is.

March was much better.

So, fast-forwarding into what we see coming this quarter, you're right sequentially, relatively flat, maybe a little bit up, but that's up because we are seeing now from March moving into April.

 “This is good news,” he said.

 Prof. Mallon said that Ireland is very active in the search for a cure for Covid-19 conducting stand-alone trials while also participating in larger international trials.

The South Bend Community School Corp. is reaching out to citizens in its district to ask for support of a referendum which will be on the ballot in June. The referendum will provide for two funding streams for the South Bend schools — one for capital improvements and the other for ongoing operations.
 The capital investment requested is $54 million to refurbish schools that are in need of repair for safety and security, expanded pre-K access and other important maintenance issues. The operations investment requests $20.8 million dollars for eight years, for increased teacher salaries, additional counselors, social workers and coaches and updated technology.
 That may sound like a lot of money, but for each individual taxpayer, the investment is very small. For an average South Bend home assessed at $100,000, taxes would increase $4 per year above today’s taxes. (Granted, the state “circuit breaker” tax cap would actually reduce our taxes if this referendum is not passed, in which case the referendum would “cost” each of us an additional $131 per year, a little less than $11 per month.)
 Some ask why the South Bend schools are in so much need. Mismanagement? People fleeing the schools because they aren’t any good? Did you know that Indiana ranks 47th in the nation in per pupil spending? The core reason goes back to 2008 when the state legislature changed the funding formula for all schools away from local property taxes. Almost immediately thereafter, the recession hit and the state was unable to fund public schools throughout the state. Gov. Mitch Daniels and the legislature diverted $300 million from public school funding to meet the budget crisis. Those funds were never replaced.

“Things are going well right now and I’m optimistic,” said Konieczny. “I’m going to therapy three times a week and I see my surgeon again in June, and I should get cleared then to resume basketball activities.”
 Konieczny went through a battery of tests and scans while she was out without finding out the source of her injury. Finally an MRI last year, after a test administered by a new trainer at VU, found the torn labrum in her hip.
 “I’m just so happy to see the light at the end of the tunnel now,” said Konieczny. “I found out that it can be taken away so fast and I have a whole new gratitude for the game.
 “There were a lot of ups and downs the last two years. It took a toll on me mentally. I leaned on my teammates, especially Taylor Richards, and I talked to my mom a lot.”
 Richards, from Doylestown, Ohio, was another VU guard who dealt with injuries. She played in 2017-18 as a freshman before missing the 2018-19 campaign. Richards served as a student assistant for the Crusaders this past season after having to quit playing due to injuries.
 Despite the injury uncertainty, Konieczny wasn’t ready to give up the game.
 “I was not OK to accept that it was over when I had an opportunity to continue to play,” she said. “I’ve worked so hard to get to be here. Coach Kellogg (SFA coach Mark Kellogg) is taking a chance on me and I’m just very happy to get an opportunity to play again.”
 Konieczny plans to pursue her MBA or a Master’s degree in clinical health at SFA.
