Pearl disappeared Jan. 23, 2002 in Karachi while researching links between Pakistani militants and Richard C. Reid, who became known as the "shoe bomber" after he was arrested on a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives in his shoes. Prosecutors said Saeed lured Pearl into a trap by promising to arrange an interview with an Islamic cleric who police believed was not involved in the conspiracy.

 For decades we listened to Farmio calling the games in that famous monotone of his, telling those stories about his curveball and St. Rita that we all knew by heart. If you tuned in late and didn’t know the score, you’d know by the sound of his voice if the Sox were down.
 Baseball on the radio is a pleasure, and we listened to him from our cars and porches. I’d listen to him out in my garden, with a can of beer when he partnered with the great John Rooney, and Chris Singleton and for years now, his friend Darrin Jackson.
 When the Sox were putrid, Farmer would get glum, like Hawk Harrelson would on TV. The sullen broadcast silences and sighs were positively Homeric.

When Tess Kinne was a seventh grader at Fire Prairie Middle School, a close friend had a special request.
   
 "My friend Juliana Bauer asked me if I'd join the wrestling team, because she didn't want to be the only girl on the team," said Kinne, who soon became the face of female wrestling at Fort Osage High School.
   
 "I went home and talked to my dad about it, because I was only playing softball and it sounded kind of interesting. But back then, if you were a girl wrestler you had to wrestle boys, and I wasn't sure about that."
   
 Kinne and her family finally decided that she should give the sport a try and, because of that decision, one day she will likely be inducted into the Fort Osage Hall of Fame.
   
 In 2019, she became the first female in Fort Osage history to medal at state. After winning the Class 1 District 4 championship, she went on to finish fourth at the state tournament.
   
 This year, she finished third in the district competition at 135 pounds and made it to state, but because of ongoing shoulder problems, she did not earn a medal this time.
   
 She is now resting at home following shoulder surgery earlier this week to correct a labrum tear and other issues that she had been secretly dealing with the past three years.
   
 "I wore a brace at practice because my shoulder really got bad," said Kinne, a National Honor Society and National Technology Honor Society member who has signed to wrestle at Missouri Valley College in the fall. "My teammates were the only ones who knew about my shoulder, because I didn't want my opponents to know how much pain I was in and what I had to deal with."
   
 Her best friend soon became Fort Osage trainer Dawna Gilbert, who made her time on the mat as pain free as possible.
   
 "Dawna and her staff were the best," Kinne said. "I spent so much time on the stim machine [which sends mild electrical impulses to muscles to reduce pain]. They did everything for me and I couldn't have made it through the past few years without them."
   
 She also credits her coaches and teammates, whose encouraging words would often seem to come at the right time.
   
 "I'd be so sore, and so down, and Haley (Ward, an undefeated state champion as a freshman) would talk with me or one of our coaches or other teammates and it would just help so much," Kinne said. "Looking back at all of this, I think my shoulder problems probably started back in my seventh grade year.
   
 "I was wrestling a 120-pound boy - but they are much more muscular - and I think that's when the tear probably happened, and I just had to deal with it. I wish it wouldn't have happened, I know I would have been more successful, but I wouldn't trade the past four years for anything."
   
 Ward, one of the premier female wrestlers in the country and a Pan American Games champion, lavishes praise on her former senior teammate.
   
 "I love Tess, because she taught me everything about the high school and the Fort Osage wrestling team," said Ward, who won the gold medal at 62 kilograms (136.6 pounds) in her age group last summer in the Pan Am Games.
   
 "We traveled to a lot of tournaments last summer and we've really become good friends. I call her my mother hen because she looks out for me and takes care of me. She and the other wrestlers - our boys and girls - have made the transition to high school a lot easier for me and I really appreciate that."
   
 Now, the Indians' "mother hen" is looking for ways to keep from going stir crazy as she spends six months on the mend - and while waiting out the coronavirus stay-at-home order - following her surgery.
   
 "Well, first, there is my school work," she said, which like all area students, she is doing online. "Then I try to do some painting, and there is always Netflix.
   
 "If anyone has any good suggestions, please let me know."

After officially letting go off their 'royal' brand, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry keep the world on their toes regarding their next rebranding strategy.
 And as the two are currently keeping themselves confined within their Los Angeles home after the relocation, their plans of rebranding have currently been put on hold, if reports are to be believed.
 As per Us Weekly, the two are ready to jump on to their next big idea but have kept the process on ice for now till the coronavirus chaos subsides.
 "Meghan and Harry are trying to rebrand themselves and want to make a big media splash but are stymied by the coronavirus situation," a source told the publication.
 "They are losing out on potential paid opportunities by having to keep a low profile," the source added.
 Further shedding light on their move across the pond to Los Angeles, California, the insider said: "They did the move to L.A. to be closer to the deal makers and are setting up calls and virtual meetings with agents, studio heads," the source explained, adding that Meghan and Harry are "plotting for a summer or fall 'splash.'"

The Streets of Kilkenny 5K may have suffered a false start, but the Marble City will echo to the sound of runners’ footsteps this summer.   Organisers Kilkenny City Harriers have announced a new date for their annual road race, which has quickly become a firm favourite with local and international runners alike, of Thursday, August 6.   The move came after the race, part of the Kia Road Race Series, was cancelled due to the ongoing threat of the coronavirus pandemic. The Streets was due to be run on April 9, but organisers moved quickly to postpone the race in light of recent developments in relation to Covid-19.   “Postponing the event was the only call to make,” Harriers PRO Nicholas Dunphy told the People.   “While we had hoped it would go ahead on the original date, news of the outbreak of coronavirus in Ireland meant we were always uncertain about that happening.”   Alternative date   The Streets was the second event on the Kia Race Series calendar to be postponed - the Streets of Portlaoise, scheduled for St Patrick’s Day was first - but the Harriers were quickest out of the blocks when it came to finding an alternative date.   “While race organisers have had to juggle dates we quickly decided on August 6,” said Dunphy. “We are hopeful that with all regulations and recommendations followed it will be far enough ahead to ensure the virus has gone. The date is also a Thursday, a traditional day of the week for our races.”   Whether the new date suits all the participants remains to be seen. A high number of entrants had signed up for the original run, but the Harriers are hoping all can make it to Kilkenny in August.   “Date on date the numbers had been up on last year’s figures,” said Dunphy. “We had hoped to break the 1,000 figure for participants, so we’re hoping we’ll have a great crowd come out on the night in August.”   Post-Race party   The Harriers will be working with race management company Pop Up Races to rearrange bookings but while the race will go through a number of changes one thing remains the same - the post-race party!   “Langton’s will still be the place to be after the race,” said Dunphy. “We will all be ready for one big party when all of this over.”

 For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.
 The dollar edged up to 108.23 yen from Thursday's 107.90 yen. The euro declined to $1.0798 from $1.0856.

The captain of a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier hit with a coronavirus outbreak has been fired by Navy leaders who said he created a panic. Captain Brett Crozier was asked to step down from his position on board the USS Theodore Roosevelt after he wrote a letter to the Navy saying more action needs to be taken to save the sailors on board. Officials say he went outside the chain of command and sent that memo to too many people over an unsecured system. So far 114 sailors on his ship have tested positive. That ship is in Guam.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Friday said that the police and 108 emergency ambulance service workers should also receive an extra one month’s salary as an incentive for their work in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had previously announced a month's salary as the special incentive for doctors, nurses, sanitation and other health workers.
 In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that the sense of duty and sacrifices made by policemen, 108 emergency ambulance workers and sanitation staff is as commendable as the sacrifices made by doctors, nurses and other health workers.
 “While the Centre has provided insurance cover for doctors and nurses and the State Government gave them a month’s salary as special incentive, such incentives should be given to other essential service workers as well. In particular, the policemen are out on the streets even when some are trying to break the law and are out and about on the roads risking a coronavirus infection. If the lockdown is a 90 percent success, the credit goes to the police,” said Dr. Ramadoss.
 He further pointed out the contribution of 108 emergency ambulance service workers. “There is a high risk of ambulance service workers and sanitation workers catching coronavirus during work. Despite the risks, they are doing their work. They should be insured for ₹50 lakh. Police personnel also use their motorcycles and cover long distances. They should be given a temporary fuel subsidy,” said Dr. Ramadoss.

Making sense of the coronavirus pandemic requires getting up to speed on semantics as much as epidemiology. Government officials and health-care professionals toss off mentions of mortality rates, flattening the curve and lockdowns, assuming that we know what they mean. But the terms mean different things from country to country, state to state, even city to city and person to person. Officials use the same phrases about mass testing, caseloads and deaths to describe very different situations. (Perez-Pena, 4/3)

In sum, Melrose in 1918 was a prosperous, busy community inured to contagious diseases that was preoccupied with a foreign war and unwilling to heed bad news that might counter the war effort. They were not prepared for the influenza virus. Most historians agree that the virus made landfall from Europe on board a navy ship that docked on Commonwealth Pier on September 6, 1918. By September 17, it had claimed its first Melrose victims. The first to die that day was William H. Davis, 19, who worked at the East Emerson Street munitions factory; the second was George H. Collegan, a canner at the Friend’s Baked Beans factory on Corey Street. Two days later, Collegan would be joined in death by a baker who also worked at Friend’s. The epidemic would also claim the lives of two employees at the Sircom Dress Factory, located next door on Corey Street, and two rubber workers from the Boston Rubber Shoe Factory. At a time when war production needs dictated that factories not shut down, crowded, dirty workplaces were ideal environments for virus transmission.

 The days since have been filled with looking back and looking ahead for Bowden after a tough ending.
 "It means everything to be part of this," Bowden said. "Last year, being the No. 1 team in the country at my dream school. Playing and contributing with my teammates. It's an amazing feeling."
 Bowden finished as one of only four Vols to total at least 1,000 points, 450 rebounds and 250 assists. He scored 1,365 career points, ranking in the top 25 in program history. He finished seventh in Tennessee history with 186 3-pointers and started 99 games - falling one shy of becoming the 14th Vol to start 100 games.
 But Bowden, who played at Carter High School outside Knoxville, reminisced more on the overall experience at Tennessee. Bowden stressed that relationships and "locker room times" with his teammates stand out as his favorite memories. He was thrilled to make his mother, Regina, proud by playing at UT.
 "Coming here was real special for her," Bowden said. "Just being here, having her come to my games anytime I want, and I know my granny would be proud of me as well. Just coming here to Tennessee was all I wanted."
 Bowden might have gotten more than he wanted or expected. He said Tennessee coach Rick Barnes pushed him harder than anyone has pushed him - on and off the floor. He learned that Barnes' prodding form of coaching is not personal, but purposeful.
 He credited both Barnes and Fellowship of Christian Athletes leader Chris Walker with helping grow his faith.
 "I think I've changed a whole lot with that, getting closer with God," Bowden said.
 Bowden's next step is setting up a pro career. He has talked with former teammates Kyle Alexander and Jordan Bone about choosing an agency.
