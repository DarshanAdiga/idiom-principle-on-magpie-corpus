Claiming all the allegations made by former Pakistan cricketers Shoaib Akhtar and Rashid Latif that the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) influenced ICC's decision to host the Indian Premier League, Basit Ali has said that in fact, BCCI was the first one to support PCB against shifting of T20 World Cup to February-March because of the Pakistan Super League.

 “In the meeting, it was decided that the World Cup will not happen. There was a suggestion in the meeting that this World Cup that was postponed should be held in February-March 2021. PCB said that they would not agree because their PSL happens at the same time and the earnings from that is used in our domestic cricket," Ali said while speaking on his YouTube channel.

 “BCCI was the first to say that PCB (Ehsan Mani) was saying the correct thing and how they can withdraw their event which is scheduled in February-March.

“But farmers are the most innovative group of people I know, and they always find a way to rise to consumer demands,” Perkins said. “It’s a real opportunity for us as producers and producer advocates to open a dialogue about where our food comes from and share in that story.”
 Ralph Morton, owner of Cattle Run Farm in Ruckersville, says the nationwide shortages have definitely increased demand on local producers.
 “As ambassadors for agriculture and the Buy Fresh Buy Local movement, Cattle Run Farms has had to evaluate our marketing and selling strategies to sustain the demand for beef and pork products,” he said. “We have managed to sustain and scale our business to ensure we meet the needs of our community using several different selling platforms: off the farm half, whole and boxed beef and pork at the Greene Farmers Market; personal and professional networks; Barn2Door; Facebook; CSA in Richmond; and word of mouth from loyal customers.”
 Born and raised in Greene County, Morton has been pleasantly surprised with the uptick in sales this year but recognizes that others in the industry are having to work harder than ever to keep up.
 “On the flip side, because we’re processing beef and pork regularly, processing facilities are challenged with meeting the needs of the producer … there is a real need for more processing facilities across the state,” he said.
 Cliff Braun of the Farm at South River agreed that the increasing sales have put a strain on the operation, but says they are glad for the new customers and hope to continue expanding their operations moving forward.
 “Sales of beef and eggs from our farm for the past six months have been more than triple the amount sold during the same period in 2019,” Braun said. “Interestingly, the bulk of our sales during the past six months have been to new customers and some have come from as far away as Pennsylvania to pick up their purchases. Nearly all of our new customers have become repeat buyers.”
 Due to increased demand, the Farm at South River is in the process of expanding its operations.
 “Based on comments made by many of our customers, the concept of buying local is very attractive,” Braun said. “Knowing where the beef and eggs come from is increasingly important.”

HONOLULU (AP) — Hurricane Douglas gathered strength as it barreled west toward the Hawaiian Islands on a track to potentially bring strong winds and flash flooding to the island chain over the weekend, weather forecasters said.The storm had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph), making it a Category 2 hurricane as of late Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said.It's expected to become a Category 3 hurricane on Thursday, said John Bravender, warning coordination meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Honolulu.Cooler waters east of Hawaii and wind shear were expected to weaken the storm before it reaches the islands. The weather service said it's likely to be either at hurricane or near-hurricane strength when it arrives.It's too early to predict the precise path of the storm in the islands. Bravender said any part of the state could be affected.Douglas was 1,570 miles (2,530 kilometers) southeast of Hawaii as of late Wednesday.Tropical Depression Eight churns in the Gulf of Mexico. A tropical storm warning was issued for much of the Texas coast.In the Gulf of Mexico, Tropical Depression Eight formed and a tropical storm warning was issued for much of the Texas coast.The depression was located about 530 miles (852 kilometers) east-southeast of Port O'Connor, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (48 kph). It was moving west-northwest at 9 mph (14 kph).The center of the depression is expected to move across the northwestern Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and Friday and make landfall along the Texas coast on Saturday. Slow strengthening is expected and the depression could become a tropical storm in a day or so.The storm is expected to produce 2-4 inches (5-10 centimeters) of rain with isolated totals of 6 inches (15 centimeters) along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the lower Texas coast, and inland through south-central Texas and the Rio Grande Valley. The depression is expected to generate swells that produce life-threatening surf and rip conditions that will affect much of Texas and Louisiana.Tropical Storm Gonzalo is strengthening in the Atlantic. It's expected to become a hurricane Thursday.Meanwhile, recently formed Tropical Storm Gonzalo was strengthening in the Atlantic and the center said it was expected to become a hurricane by Thursday.As of Wednesday evening, Gonzalo was centered about 1,045 miles (1,681 kilometers) east of the southern Windward Islands with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (96 kph). It was heading west at 12 mph (19 kph).The Hurricane Center said that interests in the Windward Islands should monitor the storm as it is expected to approach the islands late Friday and Saturday. A hurricane watch has been issued for Barbados.Gonzalo’s strengthening breaks a record set by Tropical Storm Gert, which formed on July 24, 2005. So far this year, Cristobal, Danielle, Edouard and Fay also set records for being the earliest named Atlantic storms of their respective place in the alphabet.Copyright 2020 Associated Press.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fox will be taking viewers out to the ballgame by adding a virtual crowd in parks during its baseball telecasts this season. The network revealed on Thursday that it will include computer-generated fans in the stands beginning with their three games on Saturday. Fox begins its coverage with Milwaukee at the Chicago Cubs, followed by San Francisco at Los Angeles Dodgers, and concluding with the New York Yankees at Washington. Judging how fan opinions about crowd noise being added to baseball games have been mixed, Fox may draw some jeers for adding fans to empty ballparks. But Fox Sports vice president Brad Zager, who oversees live event productions and operations, is hoping that people give it a chance before making a definitive opinion. “We believe that what we’re doing is creating a natural viewing experience,” Zager said. \"Sports is supposed to be an escape and when people have that escape we want it to feel as normal as possible when there’s very little normalcy, like a crowd at a baseball game on a Saturday. \"We're not looking to fool everyone. We know it is a virtual crowd. But we also know how jarring watching a game in an empty stadium is on TV.\" Fox has been working on a solution to no crowds since late March, when most realized crowds were not going to be allowed to return to stadiums and arenas because of the coronavirus pandemic. Fox Sports president Eric Shanks said the early versions looked rudimentary and resembled “a better version of Donkey Kong” but has improved exponentially since then. “We knew quickly that we were going to have to look at crowd and audio in a different way. The only thing we didn't know was the date when we were going to have to be ready to go,” Zager said. It is definitely an improvement over...

He was like then I should practice for 6 months and then can do it...We were laughing about it... He is an incredible human being and one of my first few or earliest advice I got from the film industry was from him. He called me and told me that don't get stuck in the illusion of filmmaking, do everything you are doing...if movies come your way, do but have fun but remember it is not the end and move on to other things," Danish shares about his meet with Puneeth Rajkumar and getting a piece of advice from him.

Endodontic treatment (root canal) treats the inside of the tooth. Endodontic treatment is necessary when the pulp becomes inflamed or infected. The inflammation or infection can have a variety of causes: deep decay, repeated dental procedures on the tooth, faulty crowns, or a crack or chip in the tooth. In addition, trauma to a tooth may cause pulp damage even if the tooth has no visible chips or cracks. If pulp inflammation or infection is left untreated, it can cause pain or lead to an abscess.

“OCIDA wishes to condemn in strongest terms a recent presidential directive to the Minister of Home Affairs, to deal with anyone protesting. This has been further echoed by the Inspector General of Police [Kakoma Kanganja], who obviously is perceived to be following the minister’s orders,” he said. “In tandem, the Lusaka Province minister [Bowman Lusambo] also echoed and banned any protests, which led to our young people running into the bush to express their grievances, in fear of the armed police in armored vehicles who were sent by the Inspector General of the Police, to deal with these unarmed and harmless children.”

In light of COVID-19, economic recession, social unrest and the fact that fans literally cannot get a seat inside Fenway Park this season, the adults among us who drink probably could use a cocktail. Massachusetts lawmakers aren’t exactly buying, of course, but they’ve expanded our choices.
 We’ll raise our glasses, then, to state Sen. Diana DiZoglio for her persistence in allowing restaurants in these times of the coronavirus to sell cocktails on take-out menus. The state relaxed its rules on beer and wine sales months ago. Mixed drinks weren’t included, though some crafty restaurateurs were selling mixers for popular concoctions to which patrons could add their own spirits.
 All of this changed last week, when the state House and Senate came to terms on a bill, which Gov. Charlie Baker signed Monday. There are limits. Cocktails sold via take-out and delivery must be sealed in containers — hey, this isn’t New Orleans — no more than 64 ounces at a time. Otherwise it’s open season on Manhattans, margaritas and martinis, provided that you’re of legal drinking age.

Wait five years and your lease will have shortened and the avaricious freeholder will be demanding even more money. LKP’s recommendation is broadly that if you are getting close to 80 years or less on the lease, then you should probably bite the bullet and extend. But if you have more than 90 years left, it may make sense to hold out and wait for the new 990-year leases without ground rent. It’s difficult to see how freeholders will be able to fleece you then.

JACKSON COUNTY, Miss. (WLOX) - Jackson County residents are reacting after another spike in COVID-19 cases. Wednesday, the state health department reported 185 new COVID-19 cases, a new single-day record that Dr. Thomas Dobbs believes is coming from community spreadWhen asked about the large increase in cases in Jackson County, state health officer Dobbs said he believes it’s from community spread rather than a specific outbreak.“It’s just people out and about getting it. It’s just like catching the flu. It’s not like there’s an outbreak somewhere where people are getting it,” said Dobbs. “It’s if you go to Walmart. It’s if you go to dinner. It’s if you go somewhere where there’s a lot of people. It’s just people out there spreading coronavirus.”Gov. Tate Reeves weighed in on the rising number of coronavirus cases in Jackson County during the press conference Wendesday, saying he is concerned and will take whatever precautions are needed.“An outbreak of that magnitude and that size, if you have 100 new patients and 17 of them have to be hospitalized, it can take up all the ICU beds in a county, even a big county and a well-run county like Jackson County very quickly,” said Reeves.Many people are pointing to the Fourth of July weekend as the reason we are now seeing more COVID-19 cases.Resident Myrtis Williams is taking extra steps to stay safe from exposure.“I’ve seen people that did get sick and it wasn’t a pretty picture, you know. It makes me nervous,” said Williams. “I sit in the car and order stuff. So, I’m in the car like, ‘Hey, can I order this because I’m not coming in there?‘”Other people like Carlos Pratt are less nervous about getting sick. Pratt finds the lack of work and potential loss of income more concerning.“I don’t know when work’s going to start back and be able to start back working and make more money to provide for your family,” said Pratt. “Really it a’int no different than the flu to me. I mean, I’ll just be glad when it’s all over with and everybody can go back to work.”Pascagoula native Don Frazure was already aware of the increasing COVID-19 cases in Jackson County and continues to cautious.“We knew that the cases were rising but with more testing you’re going to have more cases that come out anyway but we’re still taking precautions,” said Frazure. “We’re wearing our masks when we’re in public and we’re doing things. We’re being smarter about what we do, but we’re not going to be held up in our homes and remain like prisoners.”The mask mandate in Jackson County, as well as 22 other counties, remains in effect until August 3.Copyright 2020 WLOX.
