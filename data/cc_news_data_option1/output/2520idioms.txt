Fincantieri, an Italian company, acquired the Marinette shipyard in 2009, and, just last month, received a lucrative US Navy contract to build between one and ten frigates, representing a tactical shift from larger destroyers. Outfitted by Lockheed Martin with 32 vertical launch tubes and a “state of the art SPY-6 radar system,” with power capacity to accommodate arriving "electronic warfare systems,” the frigate will be capable of simultaneously attacking submarines, land targets and surface ships.

We are asking Ellis County commercial and residential landlords and tenants to come together and work through this difficult time. Economists at Columbia University predict homelessness could increase 40 to 45 percent due to unemployment this year, and reducing rent to keep neighbors and families housed may prove instrumental to preventing a wave of homelessness.
   
 Not providing the rental relief and assistance residents need to avoid homelessness will create an even greater long-term impact on our community. People experiencing homelessness are far more likely to frequent emergency services and with researchers at the University of Texas saying COVID-19 may now be spreading silently across rural counties, prioritizing housing may be critical to curbing a sudden surge in infection rates. Forcing people out of their homes also makes social distancing difficult and increases the risk of infection for the entire community.
   
 In light of the soaring cost of medical care and the current strain on some hospital resources, keeping people housed is not only moral and in the interest of public health, it is also the fiscally conservative path. Marketplace recently profiled a program in which insurers and hospitals paid for housing and "wraparound" services - programs promoting comprehensive health and stability - for high-frequency patients with hospital bills totaling over $50,000 in one year. The total cost per program participant ranged from $1,200 to $1,800 per month, which included a rent allowance maximum of $850 per month. Housing these vulnerable individuals instead of discharging them to the street saved taxpayers at least $28,000 per participant per year. Similarly, landlords keeping tenants housed could save taxpayers, including themselves, tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long term.
   
 Adopting flexible policies addressing renters' needs in the coming months - e.g. canceling or reducing rent, offering payment plans, waiving all fees, renting out vacancies by room rather than by unit or letting tenants out of their leases without penalty - will help landlords and tenants alike weather the current economic downturn, save lives and save taxpayer money.

NEW ORLEANS (AP) " Kathryn Conyers is not a baker, but she tried. And she failed. When she sought advice from her friend Carla Briggs, a trained pastry chef, Conyers was too embarrassed to send photos of the lackluster loaves. In the end, Briggs decided that she needed to come over and bake the bread herself.
 A month later, as the coronavirus pandemic ramped up, the friends saw shelves in New Orleans barren of bread and thought, 'maybe baking bread could be a business.' Soon after that, Viola's Heritage Breads was born.
 'Viola just sounds nice and homey, like somebody's grandmother that maybe would have a recipe that exists today but didn't really get the recognition,' Conyers said.
 Conyers and Briggs said they didn't see many Black-owned bakeries and wanted to bring a business to New Orleans that celebrates both Black entrepreneurship and heritage. The recipes draw on their roots, using local Southern ingredients like Louisiana sweet potatoes.
 The breads, which the pair deliver themselves around New Orleans or ship nationwide, are generous sandwich loaves like whole wheat brioche, sweet potato rosemary and white einkorn wheat. They're about goodness, not being gourmet. The fanciest thing that Viola's sells are tea cakes.
 'This is an untapped market of providing quality sandwich bread,' Briggs said. 'So, we jumped right in and it has been fun.'
 Conyers and Briggs have a larger mission: they want to celebrate the too often overlooked Black cooks and chefs in the South.
 'I've worked at Emeril's and I've worked at the Ritz Carlton,' said Briggs of her time cooking in New Orleans, 'and the people making the stocks and things that make these chefs great are mostly African Americans. They are creating the basis of this food, but their names aren't on it.'
 For now, Viola's Heritage Breads is run from Brigg's kitchen. Louisiana's cottage food law allows businesses with less than $20,000 in sales to operate from a home with some limitations. The two still have their day jobs. Conyers, who has degrees in finance and law, works for a New Orleans non-profit organization that builds playgrounds around the country. Briggs, who left restaurant work due to a carpal tunnel syndrome, founded Eat Your Words, which teaches literacy through food.
 Though the start is small, the women have big aspirations for Viola's.
 'It's not something that's a hustle. Can it grow and live on to be a staple?' Conyers said. 'Can we build wealth and knowledge that could be passed on generationally?'
 Briggs wants Viola's to create better opportunities for New Orleans restaurant workers.
 'I've been trained with the best people ever,' said Briggs, who graduated from the prestigious culinary school at Johnson & Wales University, 'but it's hard to get a job here and get respected and get paid for the knowledge and experience that I have in food.'
 One day, they hope that Viola's breads, baked in New Orleans, will be sold in grocery stores across the nation.
 'What does it look like to have a bread or item that reflects me? That reflects us. That I see on the shelf that's not necessarily like Aunt Jemima,' Conyers said.

Xi Jinping’s China is at the crossroads of prosperity and imperialism.

“Daulat Beg Oldi, Gapsan and KK Pass were in my area of responsibility. KK Pass lies approximately 8 km from DBO and 12 km from Track Junction. The LAC is on the east of the posts. Regular patrolling to various points and locations including KK Pass was carried out by both of us. Every time we went to KK Pass and other patrolling points we would find tell-tale signs left behind by the Chinese patrols to say that the territory belonged to them. We would replace them with our booties to convey the same to them. The varying perception of LAC delineation on ground has been the major reason for calling every transgression of the adversary’s patrol as LAC violation. Our patrols would also traverse up to the line of our perception. So, it was very much possible that two patrolling parties of the adversaries could come face to face at some point of time. But then there was SOP laid down to deal with such situations. I am sure it exists even today. In the event of face-to-face confrontation, the two sides would follow the SOP and eventually return to bases without getting into physical fight,” Singh told The Sunday Guardian.

The audience also seems to want to move out of its comfort zone and explore new genres as seen by the success of shows and films like ‘Made In Heaven’, ‘Ghoomketu’, ‘Chintu Ka Birthday’, ‘Little Things’ and ‘Pushpavalli’. Comedies, dramas and romances also appeal to viewers provided it is quality content that offers them a fresh or new perspective than what they see on television. Such shows, unfortunately, are few and far between.

Arteta will have a chance to establish more of a pecking order on Sunday when David Luiz is available once more for the FA Cup sixth round tie at Sheffield United. Sokratis is also available for selection having overcome a thigh injury that meant he was only fit enough to be called on at Southampton in case of emergency.
 Luiz has missed Arsenal's last two games after picking up his second red card of a season in which he has also conceded four penalties and made a string of costly errors. Despite his difficulties Arsenal opted to offer Luiz a new one year contract rather than lose him on a free on June 30, though his current terms have been extended to the end of the season.
 The deal is understood to be worth less than the £125,000-a-week his previous contract was worth and Parlour believes Luiz could prove his worth off the pitch even if he slides down the depth chart.

"And as far as contracts go in the future, they’re going to have to take the stats this year, which is kind of scary for a relief pitcher, to be honest because you have one bad game, it takes a whole year to get that back.

By Luke Clayton, Daily Light contributor
   
 During the past several years, I've had the opportunity to fish with my friend Trey Schmidt many times. Trey has a coveted "fin fish" license on the Texas coast. He spends three nights each week "gigging" for flounder, the majority he sells to Nate's West End Bar and Grill, a popular "off the beaten path" restaurant near just west of Jamaica Beach on the road heading from Galveston to Freeport. Trey can also harvest sheepshead (a great eating but often overlooked saltwater fish) stingray, crabs and a few other species.
   
 Trey's "day job" the remainder of the week is the funeral business. His family has been in the funeral business in Katy for over 70 years. My friend takes great pride in his work, regardless if that is comforting a grieving family or "gigging" his daily limit of flounder. As Trey puts it, "These three nights each week out on the bay gigging helps me do my primary job better. I'm out in the great outdoors getting lots of exercise and getting paid for what I would gladly do for free."
   
 The daily limit of flounder with a commercial license is 30 fish and Trey seldom comes back to dock with fewer fish. Last week, I met him at his family get away home on the water in the early evening, just before dark.
   
 "Luke, the tide has been low and the past couple nights, gigging has been exceptional. I expect we won't have any problem getting on the fish," says Trey as we board his 24-foot Long Beach boat rigged and ready for a night of gigging.
   
 A flounder boat has to be shallow draft because the water is often only a foot or 18 inches deep in the bays. The craft has a powerful outboard for getting from place to place but also a 24-hp engine on the stern for turning the prop that propels the craft along the shallows. The bow is elevated with powerful lights mounted below, directed to the waters just ahead of the boat. Controls for the prop engine are in front of the elevated "gigging scaffold" in the front of the boat. There is a rudder to control the direction of the boat but Trey makes minor adjustments to the course by using his gig/pole pushed down into the mud.
   
 We eased out of the harbor just after the sun had set, just at twilight. Fishing boats and Kayakers were returning to dock after an afternoon of fishing and the lights on the many docks were coming on, some of the residents of the homes were prepping their gear for a few hours of trout fishing under the lights. As we entered the bay, darkness had fallen and the lights along the coastline were twinkling from several miles away. There is something very tranquil about being out on the water at night, whether it's running a trotline in an East Texas creek or heading out to gig for flounder on the coast. It's very obvious why my buddy chose flounder gigging as a second career years ago.
   
 Trey knows the bay system like the back of his hand but a handheld GPS and Google Earth is a great aid on a dark night. It was interesting to look at the GPS and see a reef or island and have Trey point into the blackness and says something like, "One of my favorite spots is off to the right, it will be visible in a few seconds. See the little pockets along the reef and that low point? Water moves through this drain and flounder like to stack up on the edge and feed on mullet."
   
 Bait was so thick here that the flounder lying flat on the bottom only had to flip up and grab their dinner. Like largemouth bass, flounder are ambush feeders. Bass rely on cover to conceal themselves and attack food that swims by. Flounder are perfectly camouflaged and when lying on bottom, are very difficult to spot.
   
 I'm not very good at spotting flounder that are lying motionless on the bottom; this takes practice. Most of the flounder I've gigged were pointed out to me.
   
 "Luke there is a big one laying next to the bank, see him?" Truthfully, I usually had to look for several seconds to spot the flatfish, even when they were pointed out to me.
   
 Trey's catch is sold to restaurants, whole. His goal is to spear the flounder in the head with one or two prongs of his gig. I did good to hit the flatfish, "somewhere" with the gig! I've been with pros doing all sorts of specialized things in the outdoors but successfully gigging flounder ranks very high on list.
   
 Watching my friend poised with his gig in hand like a heron in pursuit of a baitfish, starring into the lights just ahead of the boat and then plunging the gig down into what appears to be only a sandy bottom. Ninety nine percent of the time, Trey hoisted a flounder or sometimes a sheepshead or blue crab into the awaiting buckets. Occasionally he would strike at what appeared to be a target and then jokingly comment that "You can't strike gold every time!"
   
 One thing I have learned about spending an evening gigging founder, a bit of sleep will be lost and an afternoon nap prior to fishing is highly advised. Make sure and plan to "sleep in" the next morning as well. Trey sometimes gets his limit by midnight or one but he is always prepared to go the distance until weather conditions cause for an early return to dock or, a limit is put on ice. It's a rarity when he doesn't gig his limit. After all, he has to keep his restaurant supplied with tasty flounder, those seafood hungry Galveston vacationers travel a long way to eat fresh flounder!

NEW ORLEANS (AP) " Though only 5 feet, 8 inches in height, Ray 'Speedy' Walker stood tall for the George Washington Carver High School basketball team last year.
 A senior, Walker wore uniform No. 1 for the varsity squad and calmly ran its offense as point guard and served as team captain for four years running. Using the quickness that earned him his nickname, he forced turnovers and turned fast breaks into scores. 'He was the heart and soul of our team,' said his coach, Nate Roche.
 Last year, Walker, 18, led the Rams to a winning 26-9 season that ended at the state semifinals in March. 'This was our year,' he said.
 Then in late April, tragedy struck, as Walker lost the use of his legs in an early-morning accident in Tangipahoa Parish, where his family had traveled to lay flowers at his grandmother's grave.
 Doctors have said the accident left his spinal cord partially severed. They give him a 30% chance to walk within a year's time.
 Now up to nearly four hours of physical therapy a day, Walker hopes to get back on his feet again, through hard work and faith. He has some feeling in his toes and in his hamstrings, sensations that he hopes will improve and expand in coming months. 'I have confidence,' Walker said. 'I pray every day.'
 No one really knows why the two cars " his mom's Honda Civic and a GMC Sierra " collided on Interstate 55 near Tickfaw before they both veered off the roadway, hitting trees. Walker was the only survivor from his car.
 He was airlifted along with his 45-year-old mother, Eunique Ebbs, and his 23-year-old aunt, Shaique Andrews, though they died shortly after reaching the hospital in Hammond. As he was wheeled into the operating room, nurses told him something about a spinal injury and asked him to sign a paper before he could go into surgery. 'That was frightening,' he said.
 About a week later, after multiple surgeries, he was taken by ambulance to Children's Hospital New Orleans. Since then, he hasn't spent a night alone. His evening companions are a rotating cast of two aunts, his older sister, and his closest friends " his teammates from Carver. All of them gathered on the lawn of Children's Hospital for an official graduation ceremony a few weeks ago.
 He sat in his wheelchair and joked and laughed, a vast improvement from last month, when he could barely move because his spine was immobilized by a bulky back brace. He was in horrible pain from his right arm, which was broken in several places.
 To get Walker to the double funeral held for his aunt and his mother, hospital staff carried him in on a stretcher.
 At the time, John Allenbach, his senior advisor and most frequent guest, would often sit with him and feed him, a task he can now accomplish on his own.
 In most ways, he's also back to his sunny, intellectually curious self, said Allenbach, describing how Walker was also a standout in the classroom, ranking sixth in his class of 184, and has hopes of becoming an engineer.
 Through sheer charm, Walker also somehow made sure his teammates attended class and were on top of their homework. 'Everybody wants to be around Speedy. His smile can light up a room; his presence can change an environment,' said Dwana Caliste, his health teacher.
 He is still thinking of others' well-being, even from his hospital bed, as he fields a steady stream of FaceTime calls. 'He'll ask, 'Are you doing this workout or that workout? Is the competition up to your level?'' Allenbach said, noting that Walker also frequently cautions his teammates that scrimmages at parks may not keep them safe from COVID-19.
 He never was a daredevil, said his aunt Monique Andrews. 'He either was playing basketball or at home on the video game,' she said. All of his caregivers " Andrews, another aunt, and an older sister " are in their 20s, so they have been working closely with Carver teachers and the hospital's medical team to coordinate his care and work toward his release in roughly two weeks.
 It is an enormous task.
 Walker also has to deal with the trauma he's suffered, said his coach.
 'Here's a kid coming off an amazing basketball season, an historical season for Carver, and his whole world was flipped upside-down,' said Roche, who called Walker 'the heart and soul of our team.'
 Fortunately, a growing group of Carver alumni are pushing a GoFundMe campaign and helping to figure out the best ways to get Walker settled at home and possibly find a vehicle that can carry his wheelchair, Allenbach said.
 Carver alumni feel almost a duty to help each other, said Caliste, herself a Carver grad. 'If you say orange and green, there's always somebody who will walk with you, to tell you, 'Pull yourself up, you got it.' You always know that a Ram will be by your side. Because that's what we do. That's who we are.'
 Walker, who is still down 30 pounds since the accident, is grateful for the big things. But he's also yearning for very simple, normal things, like a plate of homemade red beans or maybe some rice and gravy. 'And I just want to go places. To see people,' he said. 'To sleep in my bed without nurses waking me up.'

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - Sir Speedy has called Charlottesville home for 29 years. In that time they’ve worked with many non- profit organizations helping them spread their messages.Virginia Communities for Equality is the latest group to partner with Sir Speedy. They’ve fostered a relationship in the past few weeks which has led to businesses being able to sell stickers with proceeds going to City of Promise and Congregate Charlottesville. “We try to do everything at least at cost. We try and do what we can. Most of everything we’ve done for them has been at our cost to help them out,” Sir Speedy Owner Mike Bellone said. The Bellone’s offer printed posters and yard signs but the most popular item has been the stickers.“Stickers by far. We’ve done a couple thousand stickers for them so far and we have more and more orders coming in every day,” Bellone explained.In order for Sir Speedy to be able to work with these groups and businesses they have a fund set aside for each year. “Well what we do we set aside a certain amount every year so right now we’re kind of filled till the end of the year,” Bellone said. “Whoever wants to come by or call we’re more than happy to talk to anybody.”Stickers are available for purchase at 11 businesses in Charlottesville. A complete list is available on the Virginia Communities for Equality website. Copyright 2020 WVIR. All rights reserved.
