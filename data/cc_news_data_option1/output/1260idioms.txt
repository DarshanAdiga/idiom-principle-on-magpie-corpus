"We're all older now and can drive, so we all hang out in person now too, usually to grab food or hang out at each other's houses," he said. "We have a big friend group and play a lot of different video games, but Minecraft is something we all have in common."
 Powers said he became part of their squad around the start of the school year after befriending Zach Westhaver. They both play tuba in the Midlothian concert band.
 Powers said he was soon invited into a text chat group and started hanging out with them not longer after. That kinship helped him overcome the challenges of a typical senior year that is now upside down.
 “It’s very surreal in a surreal time. This whole coronavirus thing is crazy and scary. But it’s great that I can trust my friends,” he said.

Cameron and her husband, both retired teachers, usually watch their older grandchildren, aged 8 and 11, after school and their 7-month-old baby grandson four times a week. One of their three daughters is due to have another child in July.
 But as the effects of coronavirus spread, the family decided that caring for the boys was too risky. While most people who catch the disease suffer from symptoms like fever and cough and recover in a few weeks, some get severely ill with things like pneumonia. COVID-19 can be fatal, and older people who have underlying conditions like Cameron are the most vulnerable.
 So instead of chasing after little boys, she's doing puzzles, listening to old radio shows or watching the Hallmark channel, trying to fill the hours in her much-quieter house. "I just go day by day, and when the dark thoughts come in I try and do something to take them away," she said. "I cry. Sometimes I cry."
 Still, she feels lucky she doesn't have to leave the house to work, and that she has close family ties. Sometimes she re-reads a letter her mother wrote her father while he was deployed to the Philippines during World War II, laying out her raw emotions about how much she missed him as she cared for their first child without him. "My mother is a really strong woman, and in this one she was struggling," she said. "If my mom did that, I can do this."
 The sudden change has been challenging for kids' parents too, many of whom are trying to work from home and balance childcare. Cameron's daughter Julie Bufkin is at home with her 7-month old son Calvin, working from home as a project coordinator at Arizona State University while her husband goes into the office as an analytical chemist for Intel.
 She's been taking webcam calls and answering emails while breastfeeding the baby and trying to keep him entertained, even after coming down with a fever and headache, symptoms similar to the new coronavirus. In line with the advice of public-health officials, she stayed at home to recover and wasn't tested for the virus, since she's young and healthy and didn't become seriously ill. She's now on the mend, but it only deepened her mother's feelings of helplessness.

PORTSMOUTH -- Marilyn Nelson always had home-cooked Greek food in the fridge or cooking on the stove, was "always dressed to the nines" and had an open- door policy with her children's friends, said her daughter Trina Nelson Ricker.
   
 "My mom, she was a big part of Portsmouth," said Ricker. "It's important people know how welcoming she was. I was raised by incredible humans."
   
 Nelson, 76, died Friday at Portsmouth Regional Hospital from complications of COVID-19, her daughter said. Her death was the first in Rockingham County attributed to the disease caused by the new coronavirus, but, Ricker said, her mother should be remembered for how she lived.
   
 Nelson lived in Portsmouth since the age of 2 and grew up in one of a series of duplexes on what is now the Bridge Street parking lot. An only child, she lived on the same block as her Uncle Joe and Aunt Flora and her parents owner bars, restaurants and an oil company scattered across Portsmouth.
   
 Ricker said her mother would recall when the Greek church was at State and Cabot streets and how her parents would drop her off for service, but "she'd skip it." She said her grandmother Sally Coussoule was active in the local Republican Party, met all the candidates when they stumped in town and took Nelson with her to the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan.
   
 Nelson's father Hector Coussoule owned the first gay bar in Portsmouth, but for a long time didn't even know it was a gay bar, she said.
   
 Ricker said her mother met her husband Robert at the Rosa restaurant, while he was stationed at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and every Christmas Eve the family dined at the Rosa, with Marge as their waitress.
   
 Her parents married at the Greek church and, thinking there were no local Greek bands good enough for the wedding, Hector Coussolule flew a band in from Greece. Ricker said the family recalls dancing and cooking on the Bridge Street block until 2 a.m.
   
 Nelson and her husband had three children; Trina, Christa and Robert, and six grandchildren. Ricker said her mother "was the greatest cook in the world" and always had enough stuffed grape leaves and Greek soup in the house for anyone who showed up, anytime.
   
 She said her parents would sit in the kitchen and wait for their children to come downstairs, with friends they had for sleepovers, then make all "eggs to order" with kielbasa.
   
 "There were always 15 kids in there," Ricker said. "My mom and dad always saw the best in everyone, no judgment. That's how I'm raising my kids."
   
 A tiny woman, Nelson was "super fashionable and super classy," her daughter said.
   
 "She worked really hard taking care of us," Ricker said. "Our house was always warm and clean, with food cooking and a garden," she said. "I don't know how she did it."
   
 Last year Nelson was treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation for lung cancer and five weeks later, her daughter recalled, she was walking to downtown Portsmouth to have lunch with her friends.
   
 "She was a tough cookie," she said. "It didn't even faze her."
   
 She said her mother recently fell and after a medical visit on March 12, she set up her home with a month's worth of supplies, including for her cat, so they could practice social distancing and keep her mother safe. On March 17, she said, she brought her mom back to the hospital because she was fatigued.
   
 They were told Nelson would be treated as though she had the coronavirus, as a precaution, that Nelson should not enter the hospital and go home and sanitize all her belongings. She said she left her mother at the hospital, told her, "I love you so, so, so much," and "that was the last time I saw her."
   
 Nelson was placed in a negative-pressure room, treated with antiviral and antibiotic medications and, on March 24, test results came back showing she was positive for COVID-19, her daughter said. Three days later she died.
   
 "They did everything they could for her," Ricker said. "The care she received at Portsmouth Regional Hospital was incredible. Everyone was rooting for her."
   
 Nelson said services cannot be immediate, but "rest assured, there will be one hell of a party in her honor when we are able."
   
 While grieving the loss of her mother, and homeschooling her children, Nelson said she and her husband Bryan are self-quarantined for their own COVID-19 symptoms. She said it's been different for both of them, with her losing her senses of taste and smell.
   
 She said they're certain they contracted the virus in spite of "extreme measures" she took to avoid it. After dropping her mother at the hospital, Nelson said, all her clothing went in through the basement to a washing machine she turned on with a clean sock on her hand. She said she bleached her car, sanitized her phone and didn't even bring her keys into the house until bleaching those.
   
 "That's how contagious this is," she said. "We need to flatten the curve so people like my mother don't die."
   
 In the midst of her family's grief and health scares, Nelson said, a large group of friends have left food on her porch and, on Sunday, organized a parade in front of her home for her daughter Tyler's 11th birthday.
   
 "It's moments like that, in so much darkness, I call the heartbeat of Portsmouth," she said. "This is the worst time of my life, but I have never been more grateful and thankful in my life. Through all this fear and sadness there is so much love and light. We have so much to be thankful for. We live in the best place in the world, our bubble with its own heartbeat, Portsmouth."

But for a President who relishes standing in front of thousands of supporters packed into arenas to see him speak off the cuff, the power of those numbers can't be overestimated. In some ways, Trump's coronavirus briefings have become his new rallies. His public leadership during the pandemic and ability to draw millions of viewers every night have become a crucial opportunity for him and his campaign to reach Americans as he faces widespread criticism for his government's handling of the crisis and a dramatic economic downturn that could pose a major threat to his re-election in November.

Bad news: “FDA does not have information on the stability or effectiveness of drug products past their expiration date.”
 So, if the expiration date on your hand sanitizer is pre-2017, you’re gambling on effectiveness.
 The chief concern, according to Healthline.com, is that alcohol is a key ingredient of hand sanitizer and it evaporates when exposed to air. If the bottle is not airtight, the percentage of alcohol diminishes.
 “The manufacturer estimates how long it will take for the percentage of the active ingredient to drop below 90% of the percentage stated on the label,” Healthline.com says. “That time estimate becomes the expiration date.”
 The FDA is not offering advice on what to do with expired sanitizer, but emergency measures implemented to speed up production suggest the agency is willing to ignore expiration dates for the time being.
