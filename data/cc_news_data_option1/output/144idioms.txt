Sea of Thieves did get its fair share of criticism for the lack of content on board when it first set sail, even though it has been improved significantly since then. That said, there was one thing that everybody seemed to love from the start, and that was the music. They were simply excellent pirate-themed tunes, with the catchy Maiden Voyage and the epic Becalmed (available on Spotify since last month) - and now another song has been added.

While the weather outside may be frightful, but there's no time like the present to get your kids in the swim of things.


  You may be planning a trip to warmer climes, where water safety becomes paramount.


  One of the first things to consider when keeping kids safe around water is to familiarize them with being in water and teaching them swimming basics.

Council hopes to lead by example by ensuring that District staff abide by the bylaw and plant three replacements for each tree removed by the municipality. This could cost Saanich up to $50,000 more annually to replace and care for the increased number of trees. The money will come from the parks department's small tree maintenance budget.

But any hope that the limited Iranian response might reduce the tension in the region was dashed just hours later, when a Ukrainian jetliner with 176 travelers on board crashed outside Tehran. By the weekend, it had become clear that nervous Iranian air defense forces, on alert for U.S. retaliation after the strikes in Iraq, shot down the plane by accident, a fact that Iran eventually admitted.

“Knowing how to swim and proper survival swim techniques, such as floating on your back, play a crucial role in preventing drowning. Swimming lessons will teach children several different ways to swim and float and instill confidence in a child that could reduce panic in a sudden immersion in water,” said Dr. Matt Louzon, program coordinator of Safe Kids South Chicagoland and ThinkFirst University of Chicago. “Older children who never had formal swim lessons may also benefit from the advanced swim techniques and survival methods taught at higher level lessons. Since older children are more likely to swim in open water, such as a Great Lake or the ocean, these advanced methods may be put to the test in the more challenging conditions of a natural body of water.”


  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends starting swim lessons between 1 and 4 years old. Infant lessons before the age of 1 have not yet been shown to be useful, said Louzon, “but they can increase parents' awareness of water and serve as a refresher for adults who haven’t taken lessons since childhood.”


  He said he would not discourage anyone from taking lessons with an infant but warns not to let such lessons give a false sense of security about their infant’s safety around water.


  Local YMCAs, park districts and high schools often offer beginning swim lessons for kids. At the Crossroads YMCA locations in Crown Point, Hammond and Whiting, swim classes are available for those as young as 6 months. Toddler classes include parents in the pool with children and independent lessons start around age 3. Around age 6, kids can take a range of classes to expand their skills.

The giant-slaying Tennessee Titans produced a stunning performance to eliminate Super Bowl favourites the Baltimore Ravens from the NFL playoffs.
 Tennessee caused an upset when they shocked reigning champions the New England Patriots in the wild-card clash last week to earn a trip to the divisional round.
 And the Titans – 9-7 in the regular season – defied the odds again with a sensational 28-12 victory away to Lamar Jackson's Ravens in Baltimore, where Derrick Henry starred on Saturday.
 Through to their first AFC championship game since 2002, the Titans will next face either the Kansas City Chiefs or Houston Texans.
 Coming off the bye week and a franchise-record 14-2 season, confidence was high within the Ravens camp, but the top seeds found themselves trailing from the outset.
 Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who finished seven of 14 for 88 yards and a pair of touchdowns to go with a rushing TD, and his 12-yard throw to Jonnu Smith with less than four minutes remaining in the opening quarter gave Tennessee a 7-0 lead.
 Another Tannehill pass, this time a 45-yard throw to Kalif Raymond early in the second quarter, extended the Titans' lead amid silence in front of Ravens fans in Baltimore.
 A pair of Justin Tucker field goals gave the Ravens their first points as they went into the half-time break trailing 14-6.
 The Titans oozed confidence in the second half and a sequence of brilliance from running back Henry stretched Tennessee's advantage against Baltimore.
 After his breathtaking 66-yard run, Henry put the Titans in the red zone and he capped the drive with a jump-pass touchdown throw to Corey Davis as back-up quarterback Marcus Mariota motioned out of the backfield.
 Tannehill returned to the field moments later and rushed for a one-yard touchdown – the Titans ending the third period with a commanding 28-6 lead.
 Frustrated, Ravens star Jackson – 31 of 59 for 365 yards, a touchdown, two interceptions and four sacks – gave Baltimore some hope with a TD pass to Hayden Hurst with just over 11 minutes remaining in the contest but the Titans were too good.

CHARLESTOWN — The Ponderosa Park man accused of stealing more than $300,000 from an elderly man he was supposed to be looking after is heading to court this week to change his plea to guilty, according to court records.
 Ronald Morissette, 50, of 27 Ponderosa Park in Charlestown is charged with several class A felonies for the alleged financial exploitation of an elderly, disabled or impaired adult, according to court records.
 He recently informed officials in Sullivan Superior Court in Newport that he plans to change his plea in the case as part of an agreement reached with prosecutors. The details of the proposed deal have not yet been filed in court.
 Morissette had power of attorney for a 72-year-old man identified as S.S., according to court records. Morissette was supposed to be using S.S.’s money and property to pay for food, clothing and shelter for S.S., according to court documents.
 Morissette allegedly sold S.S.’s yacht for $38,000 in April of 2017, and allegedly pocketed the money for himself.
 Later in April of 2017, Morissette allegedly took $40,000 from a bank account belonging to S.S., and allegedly kept the money for himself, according to the court documents.
 In September of 2017, Morissette allegedly took more than $300,000 from two different accounts belonging to S.S. and allegedly tried to get the money applied to a treasurer’s check for his own benefit, according to the documents.
 The grand jury convened in Sullivan Superior Court in Newport handed up indictments against Morissette last year.
