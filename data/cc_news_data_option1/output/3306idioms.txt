But back to whistleblowers. Our Citizen X, the Ukraine _quid pro quo_ whistleblower. The MSM has released very little information about him, other than acknowledging that he’s a CIA officer, because they don’t want to publish details that would inevitably allow free-thinking individuals to work out who he is. The name of this whistleblower has been circulating for weeks in alternative-to-MSM publications, such as realclearinvestigations.com, run by, ahem, a former _NY Times_ editor. There’s a lot of jumping ship going on: _The Intercept_ is staffed with star reporters from the MSM who couldn’t hack it anymore.

Kim Jong-un's speech, however, was far more interesting than the announcement of these agenda items. In my opinion, there are hints in his speech that the Party will continue down the road of strengthening state and Party control over the economy. That doesn't necessarily spell a return to central planning, but it does mean more restrictions and stronger demands that enterprises and other economic actors adhere to state "goalposts"; perhaps targets of production, and sectors of priority. More like a developmental state than a Stalinist command economy, at least in theory.
