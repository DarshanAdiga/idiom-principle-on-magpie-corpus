The alert is not entirely novel. It falls into earlier predictions on the likely impacts of the pandemic on the region. Therefore, the culture of dependency by African countries on the outside world, is worrisome. Africa accounts for about 20 per cent of the United States (US) aid, with Egypt, Kenya, and South Sudan being the biggest beneficiaries. With the COVID-19 pandemic equally posing constraints to the economies of the donor nations, the situation becomes more severe for Africa.

Increased testing for the coronavirus in Ohio is not finding a higher rate of people infected with COVID-19.
   
 In fact, 94% of people have tested negative in the past 40 days, leading state officials and medical experts to say they are encouraged by Ohio's fight against the pandemic.
   
 But they warn that it's too soon to celebrate and return to the way life was before the disease spread around the world.
   
 "We can't let our guard down," said Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, chief medical officer for OhioHealth. "The bigger picture for me is a positive and I am encouraged by the numbers. But as we return to common life, we must continue being responsible and do the things we have been doing with social distancing and personal hygiene that helped get us to this point."
   
 The data provided by the Ohio Department of Health through a records request by The Dispatch shows that as of Memorial Day, 340,000 tests had been administered since recordkeeping began by the state March 4.
   
 That's 3 percent of the state's population. Ninety percent of the tests were negative.
   
 Since the state began reopening businesses May 1, 94 percent of those tested were negative. These are new cases, meaning it would not include people who had the virus and recovered.
   
 That number has held steady since restaurants began reopening May 15.
   
 Here are the other key findings in the data:
   
 The state has more than doubled tests given per day compared with what was given in April. Tests given per day in May averaged 7,922 compared with 3,635 per day in April.
   
 The number of new positive cases has declined steadily, from 697 a week in mid-April to 562 the week that ended May 23.
   
 The percentage of negative tests is increasing.
   
 Fewer tests are being ordered by doctors. The peak tests ordered by doctors was 10,879 on May 13. Since then that number has declined nearly every day. There were 6,791 tests ordered May 25.
   
 In recent weeks, the number of new tests administered has leveled off despite there being more access to tests without a doctor's referral.
   
 At least 15 testing centers in the Columbus area don't require a doctor's referral. Many of those testing centers are neighborhood urgent-care facilities and said they had been open for testing for at least two to three weeks.
   
 Gov. Mike DeWine said in April that increased testing would give him another "tool in the toolbox" that would allow him to make better decisions.
   
 "The more tests you have the better information you can get," he said.
   
 Medical experts said they are encouraged that the number of positive coronavirus cases have been holding or declining the past six weeks.
   
 But they are worried that the public will declare victory against the virus far too soon.
   
 Dr. Michael Oglesbee, director of the Infectious Diseases Institute at Ohio State University, said the state needs to test many more Ohioans over an extended time period before making any sweeping statements.
   
 "The next two weeks are going to be very informative as to how this all plays out," he said. "As we start relaxing some of the measures to prevent infections and including the Memorial Day holiday, we are going to get some information."
   
 Oglesbee, whose group at Ohio State came up with the projection models that Dewine used to make his decisions early on in the pandemic, said there are some positives he sees in the data.
   
 "From a trend perspective, this is tremendous," he said. "We have plateaued it appears by the numbers, but you still have to remember people are getting infected."
   
 Vanderhoff said the lull in positive cases is evidence that the state's tough decisions that shut down the economy and kept people at home have been effective.
   
 "I am convinced the people here in Ohio get it," Vanderhoff said. "We have demonstrated we can act together and do some pretty incredible stuff in a difficult time. This tells us we are doing a good job, but have to continue doing a good job as we get our lives back."
   
 State Rep. Paul Zeltwanger, R-Mason, has been critical of DeWine's and Acton's policies in dealing with the virus and has called them an overreaction.
   
 Zeltwanger joined another state representative recently to call for Acton's ouster.
   
 Oglesbee said that until there is a vaccine, the only way to continue the fight against the virus is through herd immunity or social distancing.
   
 But because so few Ohioans are testing positive, he said herd immunity is not an option at this point.
   
 The doctors also said Ohio needs to dramatically increase testing.
   
 The state ranks 44th in coronavirus testing per 100,000 population, according to data collected and analyzed by Johns Hopkins University of Medicine in Baltimore.
   
 DeWine has said the state has the capacity to daily test double the number of the tests administered, but that isn't happening.
   
 It's unclear if that's because not enough people are seeking tests, doctors aren't recommending them or whether other issues remain.
   
 The Ohio Department of Health said in an email that to use the full testing capacity, there needs to be clear testing guidance on how to use tests to control the virus. The agency said it was reserving some testing to use during expected outbreaks.
   
 The Health Department said testing to capacity also would require an "infrastructure" to get specimen kits out for testing and back to the labs, which requires a system, something the state doesn't have, that would include scheduling, billing and reporting. The agency said it is close to completing a system for that.
   
 Brian Fowler, ODH's chief data officer, said a majority of those getting tested are still those presenting symptoms.
   
 "We need to have as many tests as we can," he said. "We know there are positive cases out there we are not catching."
   
 The state has said it has begun testing 1,200 random Ohioans who volunteer to see if they are infected or had been infected at one time with the virus.
   
 That testing is to determine areas where the disease might have spread or be spreading.
   
 Ohioans can get tested without a doctor's referral. Google has provided a list of testing centers in their area.
   
 Three urgent care centers contacted by The Dispatch said the tests are $100 without insurance, but some policies cover the testing. The turnaround time for results is two to three days.
   
 "The virus is still there," said Dr. Nicholas Kreatsoulas, chief clinical officer for Mount Carmel Health System. "We are not out of the woods yet. We are concerned about a possible surge in the future and people should remain focused daily on how they interact with one another."
   
 Kreatsoulas said that Mount Carmel, OhioHealth and Ohio State's health systems are working together to increase testing and monitoring the virus' effect on the central Ohio community.
   
 He said Mount Carmel is conducting at least 300 tests a day at its medical facilities. Those being tested include people showing symptoms and others who are asymptomatic but are tested before elective procedures or being admitted to a hospital.
   
 "All three health systems in our community are increasing testing," Kreatsoulas said. "I know people want to get out now but we must remain cautious."

The Republican National Committee is eying Dallas as a potential new site for part of its 2020 convention this summer.
 The city is among several that RNC officials are considering as they look to replace Charlotte, North Carolina, as the location where President Donald Trump will accept his party's nomination for reelection. Trump has been at loggerheads with North Carolina over holding the convention there amid coronavirus restrictions, and he announced Tuesday that Republicans have been "forced to seek another State" for the convention.
 The RNC is still aiming to conduct the official business of its convention in Charlotte. If selected, Dallas would host Trump's acceptance speech — the biggest night of the convention — and related festivities.
 A number of national media outlets reported Wednesday night that Dallas and five other cities are under consideration and that RNC officials would tour them in the coming days. A committee spokesperson confirmed to The Texas Tribune on Thursday morning that Dallas was among the cities.
 It remains to be seen what coronavirus-related constraints the RNC could be subject to later this summer in Dallas. Gov. Greg Abbott has not yet laid out reopening standards specifically for conventions, though he has agreed with the Texas GOP that the state could be prepared to host the national convention if necessary.
 A spokesman for Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson said Thursday that Johnson "hasn't heard from anyone" about the national convention.
 The Texas GOP has said it would welcome the national convention in Texas if Charlotte does not work out. The state convention is scheduled to occur in person from July 16-18 in Houston.
 Trump is heading to Dallas next week as he resumes in-person fundraising for his campaign. He is set to attend a June 11 fundraiser there at a private home.

City officials on Thursday released a 60-page answer to a call for better racial equity and inclusion laid out 18 months ago in the Elevate Akron report.
   
 This week's update, produced by the Finance Department and called "City of Akron Procurement and Inclusion Report," charts a 20-month course to achieve racial inclusion and diversity by overhauling the city's competitive bidding and hiring processes, which will require City Council and voter approval.
   
 Major changes require rewriting parts of the city's founding document: its charter. That's not a common occurrence as the commission comes together once a decade, though charter amendments can be placed on the ballot through signature petitions or by a super-majority of City Council.
   
 The 2020 charter review commission, which is chaired by University of Akron professor Bill Rich and includes several black members, already has approved some of the major changes detailed in the new report.
   
 In July, the commission's recommendations head to City Council, which will vote on whether to put them on the November ballot for residents to decide.
   
 So far, the mayor-appointed charter review commission has advanced a change to Section 95 that would more than triple the amount of a project or purchase, from $15,000 to $50,000, before the mayor would need council's approval to bid it. Currently, any spending over $5,000 requires approval from the board of control. That threshold would also triple under the proposed change to $15,000.
   
 The move, while removing council oversight in some bids, relaxes paperwork and other requirements that stifle small and minority-owned businesses, the city's finance department found. Bigger firms that tend to gobble up city contracts have resources to better handle the time-consuming, complicated and bureaucratic bidding process.
   
 Mayor Dan Horrigan and Deputy Finance Director Shelly Goodrich, who authored the recent report, believe that relaxing bidding limits will allow more money to flow to smaller Akron businesses, giving more discretion to send public work to firms owned by African Americans and females.
   
 "We cannot simply talk the talk, as leaders we must walk the walk," Horrigan said in a statement. "As I announced in my State of the City Address just a few months ago, minority-owned businesses received just 5 percent of the City's purchasing and contracting budgets last year. That's simply unacceptable to me. And today I'm pleased to release that plan with specific strategies to meaningfully increase that number, as well as steps we have already taken to implement those strategies."
   
 A second proposal is a pair of charter amendments advanced by the commission that would relax hiring criteria that human resource officials say make it hard for skilled and minority candidates to get a city job.
   
 The first change replaces Section 108 with the "Rule of Ten." Instead of human resources being required to interview only the top three job candidates, based on test scores, the department would bring in the top 10 candidates, providing a broader pool from which to hire more diverse applicants.
   
 A related change to Section 106(a) deals with the controversial practice of favoring the employment and promotion of people because they live in Akron, which is a renewed topic of debate as protesters ask that officers live in the communities they police.
   
 A 2006 state law made residency requirements illegal. The city, which joined officials in Lima, fought to keep residency in the charter but lost in a 2010 Ohio Supreme Court decision.
   
 That year, Akron voters approved a charter amendment that gives residents and veterans an automatic 20% bonus on their civil service exam, which is taken by job applicants. A score of 70 or better passes.
   
 By way of example, a veteran who lives in Akron and barely passes with a score of 70% would get 14 bonus percentage points (or 20% of the 70% score) for being a resident of at least the past year and 14 more points as an active veteran for at least 180 days.
   
 The mayor wants to take the 20% bonus guarantees out of the charter and, instead, allow human resources managers to set bonuses for specific positions. The idea is that a candidate who barely passes but scores a 98% as a veteran and resident is hard to beat. Few people score a 97% or better, Employment and Selection Manager Stacey Doty told the charter review commission last week.
   
 For skilled positions that require college degrees, prior training or job experience, qualified candidate are getting bumped by unqualified candidates who live in Akron or were in the armed services. Doty suggested that human resources would lower the veteran and residency bonuses to 5% for these skilled positions.
   
 For police, fire, entry-level public service and labor jobs, however, Horrigan remains committed to honoring the higher 20% bonuses to ensure that Akron residents and veterans get a better shot at these careers, which require no prior experience and come with on-the-job training.
   
 "Being an Akron resident matters - having a familiarity with our community, and ideally being a part of our community even after you leave your shift - that matters," city spokeswoman Ellen Lander Nischt told the Beacon Journal. "We understand that not every police officer will choose to live here, and that is okay, but we want to provide opportunity and access to these positions for people who are part of the neighborhoods they protect and serve.
   
 "Not always -- but often -- you have a greater personal stake in the city's progress when that's where you pay property taxes, where you coach little league, where you worship, where your kids go to school and where you lay your head at night," she continued. "Those things matter. Members of the Police and Fire departments become more than leaders in their departments, they become leaders in their neighborhoods -- and whenever possible, we want those to be our neighborhoods."
   
 Another tweak to Section 106(a) would remove all bonuses used in deciding who to promote. City officials, who said they reached out to veterans' groups before pitching the proposal, say residency and military service should matter in getting a foot in the door, whereas merit on the job should drive employees into higher offices.

Frederick County will enter into phase 2 of Gov. Larry Hogan’s (R) Roadmap to Recovery on Friday at 5 p.m., County Executive Jan Gardner (D) announced in a news briefing Thursday.
 That means a long list of non-essential businesses can open countywide — including more personal services, like nail salons, tattoo parlors and tanning salons.
 Hogan’s executive order says that all customers over the age of 2 must wear face coverings in those personal service businesses, unless the face covering would make it impossible to perform business. It also states those businesses must not exceed 50 percent capacity, and that areas where services are performed must be sanitized after each use.
 “I do think there’s going to be complaints about that to those business owners, so I want to make sure people know that came from the governor,” Gardner said after the briefing regarding that part of the order.
 Gardner’s executive order follows Hogan’s order for the most part. She added, however, that she has added some requirements, like having personal services like barbershops and hair salons schedule special hours in the morning for seniors and those who are more vulnerable to complications from the virus.
 She also said some business sectors highlighted in his order, like construction and manufacturing, has been operating at full capacity in the county for multiple weeks, as those are essential businesses.
 Most businesses that are still restricted are tied to large gatherings—except for churches, which have a 250-person cap, per Hogan’s executive orders.
 Gardner said some common businesses that are still closed include bowling alleys, movie theaters, sporting events and others that involve large gatherings.
 Still, that doesn’t mean all business owners will choose to open, she added.
 “The requirements on these things are so significant that some businesses and activities are going to make a choice that they’re not going to open right now,” Gardner said. “And I really was surprised by some of the liability issues that I heard from people.”
 “There’s a number of reasons why people may not want to make an investment to move forward now, or they don’t think they’ll get enough customers to move forward,” she added.
 Some restrictions remain in place for businesses that can open, according to Gardner and Hogan’s executive orders. That includes a 50 percent capacity limit in businesses under 10,000 square feet, and face coverings must be worn by all customers that visit those businesses. Multiple times during Thursday’s briefing, Gardner urged county residents to adhere to local and state regulations in order to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
 “We’re not out of the woods yet,” she said.

In a country such as ours, good government has to start at the bottom and work its way up. If we look from the top down, we will always be disappointed.
   
 The last quarter-century of American politics has shown this more than ever. Instead of effective, bipartisan leadership in Washington, all we have seen is ineffective finger-pointing and short-term solutions applied as band-aids to long-term problems. The only thing that united our elected officials in the nation's capital was the 9/11 tragedy, 19 years ago -- and even that didn't last for long.
   
 For many, it's all come to a head with the COVID-19 pandemic and how the country has seen roughly 1.9 million known cases so far. Both sides are looking for someone to blame. The Democrats say it was an inefficient response by the Trump Administration. Trump and those in the government with him have blamed China, the source of the virus, for not being forthcoming, and said that the failed impeachment attempt early this year interfered with the executive branch's response to the spread of COVID-19. Both sides are trying to politicize a health crisis that has killed more than 108,000 people in this country.
   
 In truth, both sides have valid points. It was probably inevitable that in the country that is the center of world commerce and its single largest economy by far, that COVID-19 was going to take a severe toll. People came in and out of the country for weeks before the seriousness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was fully understood. Some scientists believe that it was in the country for quite some time before it was recognized.
   
 The national government could have been more organized and decisive in its response. China could have been more forthcoming about the outbreak, sooner than it was. However, rather than point fingers about things that cannot be done over now, both parties could sit down and spend their time formulating plans to better manage the crisis going forward.
   
 But there's a more important factor that isn't spoken about enough, which is that the American people accept these failures of leadership. Neither side holds their alleged leaders in Washington truly accountable.
   
 The national government makes fumbling, ineffective responses to natural disasters on a regular basis. Anyone remember Hurricane Katrina? That was the worst example, but there have been many others. It also messes up things in other countries, such as the disastrous interference in a whole slew of foreign nations. We can start with Iraq, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Ukraine, and that's just some of them in the last 20 years.
   
 The government fails to maintain adequate national infrastructure or address any of the important issues of the new century despite running trillion-dollar deficits. We don't have a coherent foreign policy for dealing with potential rivals who have risen since the end of the Cold War. Our roads are crumbling, our communications systems are outdated, and on the manufacturing front, we lacked the ability to even rapidly ramp up production of much-needed medical equipment when the coronavirus began running rampant.
   
 We have been failed by our leadership. The Republicans have failed and so have the Democrats. In the past couple of months, I've seen columns from professed conservatives encouraging people to vote for the Democrats in November. Why? Six years ago, when millions of working Americans (including myself) lost their health insurance and were forced to buy inferior "Obamacare" plans, the Republicans told us to vote for them and they would fix it. We did. For a time, the GOP held the White House and both houses of Congress. Our healthcare hasn't gotten any better. Each side blames the other. In truth, they both get an "F."
   
 The problem isn't what the national committees of both parties want you to believe; namely, "their party is wrong, and our party is right." The problem is neither party is truly held accountable by the people, and due to the nature of our electoral system, it's hard for the people to do this.
   
 But what they can do is hold their own senators and representatives accountable, along with their state officials. We can flood their offices insisting that positive action be taken. We can demand transparency in government, and we can demand they listen to us.
   
 We've seen some of that right here in the Old North State. Thousands of people rallied to get their churches reopened, demanding their First Amendment right to freedom of religion and for the right to safely and responsibly return to their places of worship. The groundswell brought about the lifting of more restrictions a few days later, which is something the governor's office had said was unlikely just a week prior.
   
 Our country is often called a democracy, but in truth, it is a federal republic -- a nation-state where many powers of government are devolved to the individual states, because they can better serve the needs of their people than a one-size-fits-all national government in a large nation. We use this model, and so do many other large countries like Mexico, Brazil, India, Germany and Russia. It works best when people can rely on their local leaders to get things done, and when they hold them accountable if they fail.
   
 So stay on top of your state leaders, who live and work among you, and hold the feet of your U.S. senators and representatives to the fire. No matter if you're conservative, liberal or somewhere in between, remind all elected officials constantly that they work for NC -- not for the DNC or the RNC. We're a high-population swing state; they have to listen if we send a strong message. We can make things better at home and we can influence the country as a whole. If our elected officials fail to get things done, go to the polls and fire them. Rinse, lather and repeat until they get the message.
   
 For the past 127 years, our state's motto has been esse quam videri, Latin for "to be, rather than to seem." Let's be the change we want to see and which our state and our nation deserve.

 Charges dropped against teen after review of arrest videoSAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco’s district attorney has dropped charges against a black teenager whose arrest by officers was caught on video and has drawn comparisons to the George Floyd case in Minnesota.
 Kajon Busby, 19, was charged with misdemeanor crimes of criminal threats and resisting arrest, stemming from a Jan. 25 incident in which Busby was taken to the ground and handcuffed by several officers, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday.
 A bystander video posted on social media last week shows a female officer pressing her knee to Busby’s neck while he’s on his stomach. Police also released body camera footage of the arrest, and a separate clip that synced different body camera angles with the bystander video.
 “After reviewing all that, I decided the case should be dismissed in full,” Boudin said in a Tuesday interview with the newspaper. “I went into court Monday morning and did that myself.”
 France court approves extradition of genocide suspectPARIS — A French court on Wednesday approved the extradition of Rwandan genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga to a United Nations tribunal.
 But Kabuga’s lawyers have asked another court to examine the decision, meaning that he will remain on French soil for at least 10 days and possibly months.
 Kabuga, 87, was arrested in May in Paris after 25 years on the run. He was one of the most wanted fugitives in Rwanda’s 1994 genocide. He is accused of equipping militias in the genocide that killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus who tried to protect them.

“Yeah, absolutely. There’s been some really great discussions privately behind the scenes with NASCAR, the executives in NASCAR, and all the drivers. So, I hope and expect soon that we’ll come out with a way of setting a tone with our hearts on this subject. So, I think the greatest thing that all of us can have is conversation. Conversation leads to change. Conversation leads to empathy and understanding. So, that’s happening. And, I first just want to say, I think Bubba Wallace’s strength to speak up during this time for our sport, has been awesome. And, I’m just proud of him as a friend, knowing him his whole career, too, and I think we’re going to see great things come out of this generation of NASCAR of who is in the sport right now. Hopefully it sets the tone for who comes after us. And for all of us, that would be the most important thing that we do.”

Normally we would hold 900 people that would be our maximum capacity” said Cooper. "Where the problem comes in is when we do the social distancing. That is based on the square footage of our deck."

While Bond's messaging comes in response to Adidas' recent statements, this isn't the first time the brand has been under the microscope for racial insensitivities.

The following year, the _New York Times_ published a report that included details about racially charged⁠—and ultimately scrapped⁠—campaigns surrounding brand endorsees James Harden and Damian Lillard.

The alert by Obasanjo and Boshe is also in tandem with the recent warning by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Health Organisation (WHO) on the need to protect the African food supply chain. The three organisations had jointly remarked that amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, there is need for Africans to map out measures to avoid food insecurity, adding that anything leading to food crisis should be nipped in the bud. This calls for more proactive measures by African leaders to ensure that the food sector is not jeopardised because of COVID-19. The number of Africans projected to be afflicted by poverty due to the pandemic is not small. The figure is staggering and worrisome.

Clark adds that _Do The Right Thing_ is also timely "precisely because it ends on a moment of irresolvable tension, because this is not a problem that can be solved easily. That's what I think elevates it above so many other films of its time that try to examine [the same themes], because many put a white character as a proxy--I'm thinking of things like _Mississippi Burning_ , which came out the year before--so much of the Hollywood way was to put a white crossover character in the way to make it palatable or to force a clearly legible reading. _Do the Right Thing_ doesn't do that. And for that particular reason, I think it's the ultimate film for this moment. Its relevance continues to grow, if anything."

“I think obviously anything that’s said or expressed has to come from a true heart, so that does come from the individual. But I think it does take, as a group, saying that we don’t stand for it. And once we all know that we’re all on the same page as saying we don’t stand for it, we come together with a united voice saying that we don’t tolerate hate, racism, bigotry in our sport and that it’s not okay. And there’s great conversations going on with the folks in our sport on this in planning a united front to make a statement. And I’m very proud of that. Our sport is doing a good job, but it also takes the individuals who aren’t afraid to step out and say this isn’t about me anymore. And that’s tough in our sport because our sport is all about being number one and having the most influence as far as followers and sponsorship and being up front, it’s a very selfish motivated sport. That’s just what it is. There’s one winner in our sport. And there’s usually a bunch of losers trying to figure out how to get there. So our mindset, our whole career from the time we are 12 or 13, which are very impactful years in a human being’s life, is trying to figure out how to get yourself there. And, for one time, for the drivers and everybody in NASCAR who have worked so hard to get to this place, we have a platform where there are people that we can influence and be true leaders. And being a true leader, you don’t make it about yourself. It’s about the others in life. So, I think there’s great conversations going on around how we can make this a united front and voice that hopefully helps change. And make it not about being scared anymore to acknowledge that there is something wrong here.”

“For me, I can tell you about my heart on it and for me, I don’t care if I ever win a race or a championship in my life or lose every follower I have on Instagram or sponsor that I have, but when my children grow older and I take my last breath, I want to be made sure that I was on the right side of what I felt is going on in history. And that means way more than acquiring fame and trophies and wins. Those things all fade away. But the impact you had on human beings in your life, the relationship lasts forever. So, that’s my heart behind this. I know some people might not feel the same as me and I understand that, as well. Everyone is entitled to an opinion. I just wanted to stop, in the middle of my career, and say hey, this is where I stand and there is the taunting in your head of what if I lose this or what if something happens. But, I know at the end of the day, this is what I believe in and I’ll stand up for what I believe in.”
