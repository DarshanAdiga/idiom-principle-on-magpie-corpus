You know those obnoxious sites that pop up dialogs when they think you're about to leave, asking you to subscribe to their email newsletter? Well that won't do for Scripting News readers who are a discerning lot, very loyal, but that wouldn't last long if I did rude stuff like that. So here I am at the bottom of the page _quietly_ encouraging you to sign up for the nightly email. It's got everything from the previous day on Scripting, plus the contents of the linkblog and who knows what else we'll get in there. People really love it. I wish I had done it sooner. And every email has an unsub link so if you want to get out, you can, easily -- no questions asked, and no follow-ups. Go ahead and do it, you won't be sorry! :-)

 In 2018, President Trump signed the groundbreaking First Step Act, a criminal justice bill that makes our justice system fairer.
 The First Step Act addressed inequities in sentencing that disproportionately harmed Black Americans, including mandatory minimums that created unfair outcomes. Over 90% of those who benefitted from retroactive sentencing reductions were Black Americans. The act also provides rehabilitative programs to help inmates successfully rejoin society and not return to crime.
 In 2019, Trump received the Bipartisan Justice Award from the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, a non-profit organization founded by 20 Black Republicans and 20 Black Democrats for his accomplishments in criminal justice reform.
 Trump also increased funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities by more than 14%. He signed legislation forgiving Hurricane Katrina debt that threatened HBCUs. He made HBCUs a priority by creating the position of executive director of the White House Initiative on HBCUs.
 Prior to the pandemic, under the Trump administration the U.S. poverty rate fell to a 17-year low of 11.8% as a result of a jobs-rich environment. Poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached their lowest levels since the U.S. began collecting such data. Consumer and small-business confidence were also at all-time highs, and more Americans were employed than ever before.
 Trump signed a bill that creates five national monuments, expands several national parks, adds 1.3 million acres of wilderness, and permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Trump's Department of Agriculture also committed $124 million to rebuild rural water infrastructure.
 Trump appointed five openly gay ambassadors and ordered Rich Grenell, his openly gay ambassador to Germany, to lead a global initiative to decriminalize homosexuality across the globe.

The 15HH uses a Byrd Shelix head, which is currently state of the art in planers. All of the inserts cut at a skew angle. Some muscle planers have somewhat similar heads with carbide inserts arranged in a helical pattern, but the inserts aren't skewed. They make a chopping cut, like a straight knife, rather than a shear cut. According to Powermatic (and this agrees with our own observations), a shearing cut minimizes tearout.

A planer with an induction motor, such as the 15HH, will last much longer than a planer with a universal motor (the type found on most portable planers). This planer’s motor is rated to run continuously—all day, if necessary. If you see a lot of planing in your future, and want a machine that won’t wear out anytime soon, then the 15HH or a similar 240 volt planer is the way to go.

The whole point of Star Wars: Squadrons, when you get down to it, is the revival of the Star Wars-themed space combat simulator, a genre that's been unacceptably dead for more than two decades. This means that while it's a multiplayer game that's set to launch (with full cross-play!) on every major console and thus supports the standard twin-stick layout gamepad, it's decidedly a joystick game. Setting up my old Saitek X-55 required only the slightest amount of fussing (it initially thought the throttle was the stick and vice versa, and some default button assignments needed urgent remapping), which I don't think has been the case with… literally any other game I've ever played. Even Elite Dangerous demanded an associate's degree in Reddit before I could convince it to work well with the old Rhino, and Squadrons comes close to having it function straight out of the box.

This is especially significant because Chennai’s much-awaited December festival has moved online this year because of Covid-19.
 “Every year we have a programme that runs for eight weeks. This year, we obviously cannot have something on that scale. But we hit upon the idea of an open-air event in the Rajaji Vidyashram campus,” says K.N. Ramaswamy, director, BVB, Chennai.
 N. Ravi, chairman of the Chennai Kendra, says, “Artistes felt live concerts were better than virtual ones. If the weather permits, the end of November should be fine for the festival. Other things being equal, if at all a gathering is permitted, then our programme will give both artistes and rasikas a feel of the season. The programmes will be open to all. The playground is large, and we can have sufficient space between chairs.”
 Ramaswamy explains the safety measures that will be put in place. “The playground can hold 3,000 people, but we anticipate an audience of about 800. We will place six screens on the grounds, so that people can even watch from inside their cars. Bhavan’s has an excellent reputation for its audio standards, and we will maintain that. The place will be sanitised everyday. We will check everyone’s temperature at the gate and they will be given a mask and a cap. We will arrange buses to pick up and drop those who want to attend the concerts. There will be three pick-up points — near our Kendra in Mylapore, near Narada Gana Sabha, and near Ice House in Triplicane. If there is a demand from the Adyar area, we could have an additional pick-up point near the Sivaji Ganesan Memorial. We also plan to give the audience a hygienically prepared, packed dinner.”
 Says Nalli Kuppuswami Chetti, vice-chairman, BVB, Chennai, who is on the board of many sabhas, “None of the sabhas in the city has planned a live programme this year, because no one has so much open space at their disposal. Bhavan’s is a unique attempt.”
 “The last time we made use of the school ground for a public function was in September 1983, when the school, which used to be called Rajaji Centenary Vidyalaya, was renamed Bhavan’s Rajaji Vidyashram. Chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, President Zail Singh, and a host of other dignitaries attended the event. M.S. Subbulakshmi sang the invocation song and I had the honour of playing the sruti box for her,” recalls Ramaswamy.
 ## Artistes on board
 Singer Pantula Rama, who lives in Visakhapatnam, is one of the artistes participating in BVB’s open-air festival. “Since all precautions are being taken, we should be safe,” she says. “People are depressed being indoors. I think they would like to attend an open-air kutcheri.”
