The Cape and Islands United Way presented Tony Shepley the inaugural Visionary Award at the Best Night at Home on June 28.      This new award will be presented each year at the organization's signature fundraising event, recognizing an individual who "doesn't see things as they are, but what they could be," said Mark Skala, president and CEO of the Cape and Islands United Way.
 "Anyone who knows Tony knows he is a visionary, not only in business but in philanthropy," Skala said. "He sees how things could be to improve the lives of people in our communities and he puts his time, talent and treasure toward that end. We can't think of anyone better to be the recipient of this first award."
 Tony and Lorraine Shepley have been long-time supporters of the Cape and Islands United Way personally and through their company, Shepley Wood Products. Their commitment to the community extends beyond the work and support of the United Way. The many causes they support include Habitat for Humanity on Cape Cod, Housing Assistance Corporation, as well as, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Cape Cod & the Islands, and Calmer Choice.
 When it comes to community, "I view 'civic rent' as a social obligation that we should pay back to our community," says Tony. "Paying our civic rent is how we maintain our society and our quality of life by investing in the repairs, maintenance and the building up of the social systems around us."

This $600 federal unemployment benefit is scheduled to end “on or before July 31, 2020.” However, due to a technicality in the fine print it is possible that the payment ceases a week before. This is because July 31 happens to be a Friday, and states usually send the weekly benefits on Saturday or Sunday.
