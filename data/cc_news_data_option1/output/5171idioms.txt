JUNEAU, Wis. (AP) — A Beaver Dam man has pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his ex-wife in a plea deal with prosecutors. Ulisses Medina Espinosa, 33, entered the plea to first-degree intentional homicide Tuesday in Dodge County Circuit Court. Medina Espinosa will get a life sentence, but under the terms of the plea agreement may be eligible for parole and community supervision. He was charged with the March 2019 shooting death of Stacia Hollinshead. The shooting took place at a Beaver Dam residence while Hollinshead and her daughter were visiting her grandparents. Hollinshead was shot 15 times while the girl was in a nearby room. Hollinshead was an assistant state's attorney in DeKalb County, Illinois. Hollinshead had filed for divorce from Medina Espinosa in 2016 and filed for a protective order against him the same year. Sentencing is scheduled for April 5. The prosecution has agreed to argue for no more than 50 years in prison until parole eligibility and the defense no less than 30 years in prison.

It now becomes incumbent on all Americans to collectively cross the finish line. The arrival of this vaccine, as historic as it is, does not mean the pandemic is over. The coronavirus will continue to dominate and disrupt our daily lives for coming months, and many more people will fall ill and die. We must remain committed to simple safety practices for the foreseeable future: Even though we can begin to see the edge of the forest, we are not nearly yet out of the woods.
 “Now is not the time to let our guard down. While the arrival of the vaccine is a game-changer in the fight against this pandemic, we recognize that the delivery of subsequent vaccines for the general public will take time over several months,” Med Center Health President and CEO Connie Smith said in a statement Monday. “We all must continue to wear a mask, practice proper hygiene and keep socially distant.”
 Due to existing health conditions, some Americans will be advised against receiving the vaccine. Others will choose not to be vaccinated for less legitimate reasons. But we encourage all who are medically able to receive the vaccine to do so as soon as it becomes available to them. For many of us, that day will be weeks and months away, but it will eventually come.
 The sooner that a wide swath of our population is vaccinated against the virus, the sooner our society and economy can begin to reclaim the normalcy that now seems like such a distant memory – and even more importantly, the sooner we can escape the pandemic’s terrible wake of sickness and death.

So where are we…mysterious new currencies are being invented by whoever wants; these new currencies intersect with reality only in terms of massive energy consumption; cryptocurrencies will drive up energy consumption at warp speed at the same time that Grantcoin is trying to drive down consumption elsewhere. We are creating money out of thin air to throw at anything that is deemed to be “good”, unencumbered by outdated economic consequences like efficiency or rate of return (if we were truly interested in reducing global CO2 levels, we’d be shouting from the rooftops, insisting the rest of the world convert from coal to natural gas, and the feds would be building 5 natural gas pipelines to the west coast to send to China, and they’d subsidize those gas sales to stop China from building a planned 250 GW of coal-fired power (yes, that’s how much is under development, and for context, in 2020, the US will add 20 GW of wind and solar in what has been a very strong year for that), and global emissions would be reduced just as the US did by switching to gas from coal, but that’s not deemed “good”). I can’t imagine what sort of tortured thought processes are required to reconcile those two trajectories, but then again I don’t hang out in Ottawa much.

Despite revenue declining, the management team at Five Star reported continued improvements to its bottom line as a result of its restructuring efforts. Net income for the latest quarter was $3.72 million. This compares to a loss a year earlier of $7.07 million. Year-to-date, the company’s bottom line improved from a loss of $36.10 million to a loss of only $10.49 million. As a note, these numbers are for continuing operations and exclude discontinued ones.
 Investors who are bearish about Five Star might rightfully point out that losses are still losses. That’s true, and it’s why it’s still important to remain cautious and realistic about how much upside does exist for the firm. Having said that, when you look at other profitability metrics, the picture looks far better. My personal favorite is operating cash flow. In the latest quarter, the company’s operating cash flow totaled $21.88 million. This was more than triple the $6.65 million seen a year earlier. This was not just a one-quarter thing though. So far in the first three quarters of 2020, operating cash flow was $62.04 million. This compares to $12.08 million seen a year earlier.
 Another important metric for investors to look at is EBITDA. Actual EBITDA has been a bit volatile, but the overall trend is improving. In the third quarter last year, it was negative to the tune of $4.97 million. This year’s third quarter saw it move positive to the tune of $7.14 million. So far in 2020, it is still negative, but only by $0.89 million. This compares to a negative $20.87 million in 2019. On an adjusted basis, however, the situation is even better, having risen from -$3.02 million in last year’s third quarter to $6.84 million today, and with results for the first three quarters rising from -$6.68 million to $26.33 million.
 Valuing any firm can be tricky, but one thing that makes our job easier here is just how healthy Five Star’s balance sheet is. Including restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents today stand at $120.44 million. Of this, $95.78 million is not restricted. Debt, however, is a paltry $7.26 million. This works out to negative net debt of $113.18 million. The firm’s market cap today is only $247.84 million as I type this. Stripping negative net debt out, we arrive at an EV (enterprise value) of $134.66 million.

This year, the permits were issued to the Emir of Qatar, his father, brother and the Qatari prime minister, besides other close members of the royal court, the Dawn reported.
 Permits to hunt houbara bustard usually earns Pakistan loads of money as only super wealthy Gulf Arab monarchs and their immediate family members are usually allowed to hunt the vulnerable species. The super rich in the Gulf believe that the meat of the bustard is a highly priced aphrodisiac.
 The Pakistani government offers dozens of permits to the ultra wealthy Arab princes every year, despite stiff opposition from the people of Balochistan. The Balochis, who hold the line that they are re under illegal occupation by Pakistan, have resisted the move historically, leading to a court ban on hunting permits.
 However, the Pakistani government earned a Supreme Court verdict in 2015 that allowed it to resume giving permits for the Gulf princes. The government argued in court that hunting permits for the influential royal family members from Gulf emirates help build better diplomatic ties.
 In 2016, it was reported that the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) launched an attack against the bustard hunting group led by Abu Dhabi Prince Saif bin Zayd al-Nahyan while they hunting Houbara bustards in its southern plains of Balochistan.
 The bustards are categorised as "vulnerable" species at high risk of extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). A BBC report earlier this year said <a

Restaurants are rethinking the amount of dining space they need and are adding drive-thru lanes. Starbucks is closing 400 U.S. cafes and speeding up its plans to build more pickup-only locations.

Carrabba’s Italian Grill, a 220-restaurant chain, has launched a delivery-only brand called Tender Shack out of its kitchens.

 “Out of necessity,” she said, “we figured out a new path together.”
 GROUNDED
 The pandemic grounded most corporate travelers. And it demonstrated that much of the business that used to be done in-person can be achieved as effectively, or nearly so, via email and Zoom conference calls. Amazon, which told it employees to stop traveling in March, says it’s saved nearly $1 billion in travel expenses so far this year.
 Any long-term decline in business travel would have far-reaching consequences — for corporations as well as for the airlines, hotels and restaurants that cater to them. Business travel accounts for more than a fifth of global spending on travel and tourism.
 Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian has suggested that business travel could settle into a “new normal,” 10% to 20% below where it used to be. Southwest Airlines’ CEO Gary Kelly noted that while overall passenger revenue has dropped 70%, business travel — normally more than one-third of Southwest’s traffic – has tumbled 90%.
 “I think that’s going to continue for a long time,” Kelly said.
 One possibility: Instead of sending executives out on regular trips to check on field operations, major companies could fly key employees to headquarters once a year.
 In the meantime, some tourist destinations have so far managed to weather the storm. German restaurants and hotels in top tourist destinations like the seashore or the Alps — especially those with outdoor terraces or beer gardens — enjoyed some respite over the summer as many people vacationed at home rather than flying to Mediterranean destinations. It’s unclear, though, whether that trend will continue.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee Comptroller Justin Wilson won’t run for reelection and he is endorsing his deputy to replace him, the six-term Republican announced Wednesday. Wilson revealed his decision in a letter to state lawmakers and endorsed Deputy Comptroller Jason Mumpower, a former Republican state representative from northeast Tennessee. \"Tennessee is well positioned for the future,\" Wilson, 75, said in the letter. “As I have contemplated my own future, I have determined that now is the time for me to step aside.” State lawmakers first elected Wilson to the constitutionally elected office in 2009 and he was last reelected to a two-year term in 2019. The comptroller's office is tasked with a variety of financial oversight duties, including government audit responsibilities. A Nashville attorney, Wilson previously served as state Department of Environment and Conservation commissioner and deputy to the governor for policy under former GOP Gov. Don Sundquist. The GOP-supermajority General Assembly will elect Wilson's replacement in January. It's unclear what other candidates might vie for the position. The comptroller is one of three statewide Tennessee offices elected by state lawmakers. They also pick the secretary of state for four-year terms and the treasurer for two-year terms.
