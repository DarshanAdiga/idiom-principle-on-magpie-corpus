COMMERCE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) — Authorities were trying Friday to determine who taped razor blades to the bottom of a Trump 2020 campaign sign, slicing the fingers of a worker tasked with removing signs that were too close to a roadway in southeast Michigan.The 52-year-old Commerce Township building inspector needed stitches after cutting three fingers Wednesday afternoon, the Oakland County sheriff’s office said in a release.A second sign also was found to have razor blades taped “all along the bottom edge,” according to the sheriff’s office. Both signs were along a road in front of a home in Commerce Township, which is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.A township ordinance requires campaign signs to be 33 feet (10 meters) from the center of the roadway. The signs being removed were 24 feet (7.3 meters) from the center of the roadway.“Deputies spoke with the homeowner (who) indicated their signs had previously been stolen, and when they returned from out of town the signs were back in their yard,” the sheriff’s office said in a release.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Michael Obafemi has been challenged to prove he can hack it in both international and Premier League football by firing the Republic of Ireland into the European Under-21 Championship finals.
 The 20-year-old striker, who made his Ireland debut as a substitute in Denmark almost two years ago, was disappointed not to be included in Stephen Kenny’s first senior squad last month and has had to make due with just two brief appearances as a substitute for Southampton so far this season.
 However, with Aaron Connolly and Adam Idah with the seniors this time around and Troy Parrott injured, Obafemi has a chance to make a name for himself at Under-21s level on Tuesday as Ireland attempt to ease their way closer to qualification against Italy in Pisa.
 Manager Jim Crawford said: “I had a long conversation with Michael and he was great. He said that he was looking forward to coming into camp and he was going to give everything, and he’s been true to his word since the first minute he arrived.
 “Michael’s bubbly anyway, that’s his nature, but when it’s come to training sessions, he’s very effective and he’s looking forward to the challenge.
 “I know things haven’t been great for him at club level at the minutes – he’s only played just over 25 minutes with his club, Southampton, and okay, it’s the senior squad.
 “But what an opportunity and platform for him to go and prove himself to the manager at Southampton and to the senior manager to say, ‘Don’t forget me in your plans because I can play at this level’.”

With less than a month left for the byolls for two Assembly seats in Odisha, the Biju Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party have fielded sons of the deceased MLAs, who had represented Tirtol and Balasore Sadar seats.
 The ruling BJD on Monday announced Bijaya Shankar Das for Tirtol represented by his father late Bishnu Charan Das.
 He would cross swords with BJP candidate Rajkishore Behera, who had left the Congress recently, in the reserved seat for Scheduled Caste candidates.
 The BJP fielded Manas Kumar Dutta in Balasore Sadar seat which fell vacant after his father former MLA Madan Mohan Dutta had died of cardiac arrest in June last. Swarup Kumar Das, who had a successful stint in the civic body elections, is BJD candidate.
 The two next generation politicians in their early thirties have already plunged into campaign trail seeking votes in the name of their late fathers.
 Bishnu Charan Das, a veteran BJD leader, had won Tirtol in 2019. But he had won the Jagatsinghpur seat for five consecutive times between 1990 and 2014. He was a Minister in the Naveen Patnaik government and was also elected to the Upper House of Parliament. Known for his organisational calibre, the late BJD leader had huge following in Jagatsinghpur district.
 Bijay Kumar exuded confidence that his victory margin would be 50,000. “However, our key issues will be unemployment and issues of farmers which were duly addressed by the BJD government,” he said.
 On the other hand, Manas Kumar said, “My father was very popular in Balasore. He was always available when people needed him the most. I have confidence on the good will my father used to carry.” Madan Mohan Dutta, as BJP candidate, had won the Balasore Sadar seat for the first time in 2019.
 October 16 will be the last date for filing nominations. Scrutiny of nominations is scheduled on October 17 and October 19 will be the last date for withdrawal of candidature. The polls will be conducted on November 3 and counting will take place on November 10.

"I have shared my communications with him with authorities and have faith in the process," Kornbluh said.
 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo last week instituted new anti-Covid 19 measures to try to stop hot spot clusters in Brooklyn, Queens, and several New York City suburbs from spreading further.
 His executive order limits gatherings in houses of worship up to 25% capacity or maximum of 10 people in "red zone" clusters, while those in the "orange zone" can operate up to 33% capacity with a maximum of 25 people. Houses of worship in a "yellow zone," meanwhile, may operate up to 50%.
 On Friday, Cuomo said such restrictions were not unprecedented.
 "We have always attacked clusters. This cluster happens to be predominantly the ultra-Orthodox in Brooklyn and Queens," Cuomo said. "This is not the first time the state has taken this action."
 But the restrictions exacerbated existing tensions between city leaders and some in the Orthodox Jewish community.
 Orthodox Jewish group Agudath Israel of America filed a lawsuit requesting a temporary restraining order blocking the new restrictions and arguing that Cuomo's order "disproportionately impacts Orthodox Jewish services."
 But on Friday a federal judge ruled against the group.
 "This ruling is disappointing, to say the least," said Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel, executive vice president of Agudath Israel. "Of course we understand the importance of taking precautionary measures against Covid-19, but there are ways to do so without totally disrupting our ability to use our shuls."
 Meantime, the New York Jewish Agenda -- an organization that, according to its website, works to advance social justice and combat anti-Semitism -- on Friday joined a group of Orthodox rabbis and Kornbluh in urging people in Covid-19 hotspot areas across the city to comply with health measures, according to a news release from the organization.
 "Asking all of us to wear masks, to observe social distancing and avoid large congregate gatherings is not an antisemitic act on the part of our city and country in the attempt to save lives," said Rabbi Sharon Kleinbaum, a cofounder of NYJA.

Comisarul de poliţie era cu maşina de serviciu deşi se afla in timpul liber. Ca să se scuze a zis că a băut doar un cidru şi că pur şi simplu nu şi-a dat seama că e o băutură atat de alcoolizată.
 Şeful Serviciului de Permise Auto şi Înmatriculări din Iaşi a fost prins beat la volan duminică seară pe un bulevard aglomerat din oraş.
 Comisarul şef de poliţie era la volanul maşinii de serviciu, după ce a stat la terasa unui bar, cu mai mulţi apropiaţi. Un instructor auto chiar l-a văzut cand a plecat, in trombă, din parcare şi a sunat imediat la 112.
 Radu Neneștean, instructor auto: "Am observat Loganul Serviciului de Permise parcat in faţa acelei terase. Bineinţeles că mi-a atras atenţia şi am oprit maşina, ca să văd dacă se afla cineva la terasa respectivă. Cand am coborat, l-am observat pe domnul Zacornea, era cu spatele către mine, cu un păhărel de 150 de grame cu tărie. La un păhărel micuţ nu putea să aibă suc in el sau cidru, cum a declarat dumnealui. Evident, in jurul orei 20 şi ceva, dumnealui a ieşit afară, s-a urcat in maşina instituţiei, care este plătită din banii noştri, ai contribuabililor, pentru a se deplasa in interes de serviciu. Nu in interes personal la craşmă. A urcat in maşina respectivă, a gonit in trombă. Moment in care eu am apelat serviciul 112 pentru a-l opri pe dumnealui".

 He said the grants will “allow our wonderful theatres, museums, music venues and cultural organisations to survive this crisis and start putting on performances again – protecting jobs and creating new work for freelancers.
 “This is just the start – with hundreds of millions pounds more on the way for cultural organisations of all sizes that still need our help.”
 Other venues in line for a boost include the Northcott Theatre in Exeter and Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield.
 The Charles Dickens Museum and Florence Nightingale Museum, both in London, are also recipients.
 Wigmore Hall in London, National Maritime Museum Cornwall, Halle Concerts Society, Manchester and Royal Liverpool Philharmonic are also among those receiving funds.

Actor-turned-politician Kushboo Sundar quit the Congress on Monday and joined the BJP here, asserting that she had come to realise that if the nation has to move forward, then someone like Prime Minister Narendra Modi is needed to take the country in the right direction and to its glory. This will be her third political innings after serving first in the DMK and then in the Congress, and now the BJP, which is a marginal force in Tamil Nadu, that hopes its political standing will get a boost with her induction in a state where film stars have enjoyed relatively big influence compared to most other regions of the country. Kushboo, who also met BJP president J P Nadda, joined the saffron party at its national headquarters hours after resigning from the Congress primary membership protesting in a letter to its interim president Sonia Gandhi against what she described as some leaders dictating terms and suppressing her.

Now, some Black Americans are wary of President Donald Trump’s false claims of widespread mail-in voter fraud, along with reported mail delivery problems within the U.S. Postal Service. Advocates have decried the president’s recent call for his most fervent supporters to monitor the polls on Election Day as an attempt at voter intimidation in the Black community, although Trump has denied this.

Set design and production also played a major part in "ON:E." According to a press release, the show's production cost was eight times larger than that of "Bang Bang Con." There were four different stages, a carousel appeared at one point, some cool laser lights created the appearance of a boxing ring, screens were everywhere to give a 360-degree immersive illusion of traveling to multiple venues. It was definitely a trip, to say the least.

Rita Moreno: In the final analysis, Norman Lear wanted to do a show that was universal. What is more universal than a family? Whether it is Cuban or Italian or Jewish, it's still a family. It's still a pain in the neck girl, sister who is a smartass. There's the boy. There's the grandmother who is all drama. There's the woman who runs the family, Justina Machado, who is only brilliant and funny and breaks your heart. We have everything, everything you could want in a situation comedy. I don't even like to call it a sitcom, it's a situation comedy. It's a great piece of life.

Hill isn't a bad option as a rusher, either. His career yards per carry bests both Kamara and Murray, so at least for the change-of-pace, Hill is worth rushing a few times a game, although probably not in the red zone.
 It's as a passer where Hill's role should probably totally be nixed. While it's a small-sample size, it doesn't make sense to take the ball out of Brees' hands on pass plays for a quarterback with a scattershot arm.
 And while we said we wouldn't get into it, that certainly doesn't sound like a $16-million player. But the contract is already signed, so that's mostly irrelevant. Overall, it makes sense for Payton to continue using Hill to some extent — the Saints' head man just needs to make sure his creative uses of Hill don't take away from the higher probability Kamara, Murray, Brees or Michael Thomas have of dramatically altering a game in the Saints' favor.

While he said that he hoped controls would be able to be eased, he acknowledged that they may be required to remain in place until Christmas and beyond.
 “The purpose of doing this is to ensure we get the virus under control so by the time that we get through to after Christmas we are in that position where it is under control,” he told Sky News.
 “Indeed I hope it will be sooner than that.”
 In a statement, seven local leaders from Merseyside including Metro mayor Steve Rotheram and Liverpool City mayor Joe Anderson said they had been told pubs, bars, betting shops, casinos, adult gaming centres and gyms would all have to close.
 They said that they had made clear the support on offer – including the job support scheme announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak for the Government to pay up to two thirds of the salaries of staff in businesses ordered to close – was inadequate.
 Mr Rotheram said there was little they could do to challenge the decision, but that discussions had been continuing through the night on an improved support package.
 “We were told we were going into Tier 3, no ifs, no buts. We can either expend energy on that or we can try and get a better deal,” he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.
 “Some people like to shout at the wind but if they can’t change the direction of the wind it is important to shield people from its effects.”
 In Manchester, City Council leader Sir Richard Leese said local leaders were still in discussions with the Government as to what restrictions should apply in the area.
 Despite high levels of infections, he said they had made the case that Greater Manchester should be placed in Tier 2 as there was little evidence that pubs and bars had been responsible for the spread of the disease in the area.

We got to see the world through someone else's eyes for a couple of weeks, and we have all felt enriched by this extraordinary story.

Based on application, the consumer electronics segment accounted for nearly two-fifths of the global battery metals market revenue in 2019 and is anticipated to rule the roost till 2027. Rise in demand for consumer electronics gadgets such as smart phones, laptops, CPU, tablets and others fuels the segment growth. At the same time, the energy storage systems segment would manifest the fastest CAGR of 8.5% from 2020 to 2027. Rise in demand for standby backup power can be fulfilled with the help of energy storage systems. This factor propels the growth of the segment.

Rita Moreno: What's really special about One Day At A Time is that it takes on very difficult topics. One of which is coming up, about pleasuring yourself. I remember reading the script and going, 'really? you can do this?' But, what's very special about this show is that it does that but it does so with such an enormous heart and such an enormous soul. Sometimes, I swear you could be choking on your laughter and you're suddenly choking on tears. Because we have writers who are geniuses who can actually make that happen. I have to tell you, that's very difficult. To be funny and then really, a second later say something that makes people laugh. That is skill. That is creative. And, we have all of that in spades. We are truly, truly, I mean we have trouble sometimes keeping a straight face. And we sometimes don't talk about enough, we are extremely funny people. (laughing).
