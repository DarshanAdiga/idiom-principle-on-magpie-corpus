Manufacturing and Services PMI forecast to drop deep into contraction in April. Correlation with the better known PMI report from the Institute for Supply Management. Dollar unlikely to be affected by sharp decline in business sentiment. The damage to the US labor market from the extensive, though not universal, commercial and social closures from the Coronavirus has been documented in the 22 million claimants for unemployment insurance in the last four weeks. Another four million are expected to join the rolls this week meaning that a devastating 15.9% of the 164.6 million American labor force has been fired since the middle of March. Unfortunately the accounting for the economy is just beginning. The outlook in the business community had already deteriorated to recession levels in March even though most of the shutdowns did not begin until in the third week of the month. Attitudes among business executives are expected to fall much further in the months ahead. Markit's purchasing managers indexes (PMI) are predicted to drop to 37 for manufacturing and 32.5 for services in April. Markit manufacturing PMI FXStreet That collapse in sentiment wasevident in the Markit indexes for March. The manufacturing PMI dropped to 48.5 from 50.7 in February and the services PMI plunged to 39.8 from 49.4. Markit's relatively newseries has not yet become a market touchstone for business sentiment and its primary interest is as a precursor for the widely followed indexes from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). Indexes from both organizations have similar compositions with scores above 50 marking expansion and below contraction in the industry or sector. The ISM manufacturing PMI for April will be issued on May 1 and the services index on May 5. Purchasing managers' indexes in the markets Sentiment in the business community has long been used as a forward gauge for the US economy. Supply executives are positioned at the juncture of sales and planning. They use the incoming revenue and orders data to advise on future production, expenditures and hiring. Their decisions and outlook both reflect the state of the economy and help to determine its future. Every fall below 50 in the indexes has not predicted a recession but every post-war recession has been accompanied by a period of contraction in one or both of these indexes. Markit and ISM histories The purchasing managers' indexes from IHS Markit of the UK do not have the long history of those from the Institute for Supply Management whose manufacturing index began in January 1948 and services version commenced in July 1998 Markit's manufacturing data starts in April 2012 and the services statistics go back to November 2013. In that time the March reading in manufacturing was the first below 50 and the February score for services was its first. The March scores for both were also the lowest in the series. The lack of a financial crisis reference for the Markit data is notable because for most economic statistics the 2008-2009 recession is deepest dive since the double recession of the early 1980s. For instance, in the second half of 2008 the ISM manufacturing PMI plunged from 50.8 in July to 34.5 in December. It was the lowest reading in 28 years, since 29.4 in May 1980 which remains the record low for the series. In the 72 year history of the ISM manufacturing index there have been 21 monthly scores at or worse than the 37 April forecast for Markit's manufacturing PM. The longest spell was seven months in 1948 and 1949 followed by four months in 1974, three in 1980, two each in 1953, 1957-1958 and 1980 and one in 1952. The average time from the lowest score to a return to expansion was 5.4 months. Reuters Business cycle vs ordered shutdown The relatively prompt return of the American business sentiment to expansion in all of the recessions listed above, even the deep 1981-1982 and 2008-2009 downturns is indicative of the resilience of the US economy. When the economic corner had been turned executives began planning and executing for the recovery. Business spending is one of the early drivers of most recoveries as consumer spending normally takes a while to regain confidence. There are two profound difference in the current situation and since neither has occurred before there can be no certainty how businesses will respond. American state, local and federal governments have never ordered widespread closures of commercial activity. The harm and perhaps extinction that has been inflicted on many businesses makes it very difficult to know how many will survive and will be able to resume when the shutdown orders are lifted. Second, the speed and extent of the job losses over the last five weeks may have inflicted such a shock on consumption that even if and when many workers are rehired the volume of business may take months or even years to return. The answers to both of these questions will not surface until the government closure orders are lifted. For now statistics have not yet plumbed the depths of the economic trough that lies ahead. Conclusion and the dollar Economic statistics are looking over the edge of the abyss. It is possible that as the shutdown orders are lifted economic life resumes at a relatively rapid pace, workers are rehired, consumers take to the stores in large numbers and by year end much that was lost will have been regained. It is also possible that the damage has been so severe that many of the jobs are gone and that consumers are so shell-shocked that it will be years before they reacquire normal habits. This economic situation is unique and a plausible argument can be constructed for either scenario. Two things however, are certain. First is that April's statistics will not be the bottom of the abyss. Second is that until that bottom is in sight, the dollar's safe-haven lure will not dissipate.

Durable goods orders to fall the most in six years. Business spending retreat to be the worst since the financial crisis. Dollar willretain safety edge as economy sinks. Orders for long-lasting consumer and industrial goods are expected to confirm that a massive retreat in consumption is underway as the consumer and retail sectors reel from a historic collapse in employment. Durable goods order are forecast to plunge 11.9% in March, the largest drop in six years. Non-defense capital goods orders, a proxy for business spending, are expected to fall 5.7% in their biggest decline since the financial crisis. Earlier in the month the Census Bureau reported that retail sales decreased 8.7% in March. Reuters More than 22 million Americans have been forcibly laid off in the past four weeks by government mandated business closures as part of the public health effort to retard the spread of the Coronavirus. Another four million workers are expected to file for unemployment insurance this week bringing the total to 15.9% of the 164.6 million member labor force. Even though the vast majority of the unemployed receive benefits, the loss of upwards of half their buying power combined with the social restrictions and store closures in much of the country have crippled an economy that just six weeks ago had near record employment and the longest expansion since the Second World War. US Economic growth The US economy had been expanding at a 2.7% annualized rate for the first quarter in mid-March according to the Atlanta Fed GDPNow model. The estimate is now -0.3% and the bank will release an updated GDP figure on Friday April 24. It is widely anticipated that the collapse in spending in the last two weeks of the month will be enough to drag the entire quarter into the negative. The Reuters survey of economist conducted for the April 29 first quarter GDP release forecasts a 4.1% contraction. Estimates for the second quarter growth range from -5% to as low as -30%. The severe contraction in business spending is an indication that even early in the crisis managers were taking extreme defensive measures to protect their operations. Reuters Shutdown economics A number of states in the south and mid-west are beginning to reopen commercial activity. But before this movement can become widespread enough to reverse some of the economic toll of the closures the local authorities will have to demonstrate that the lifting of restriction has not appreciably increased the number of Coronavirus cases and fatalities. The debate within the USas to the most effective response to the virus, a number of states in the middle of the country never ordered social limitations or closed businesses, is about to be assisted to conclusion by the results of these initial liberalizations. If the partial reopening of Georgia and Florida are successful then the future may look quite different at the end of May than it does now. Conclusion and the dollar There has never been an employment and consumer spending debacle like this in the economic history of the United States. The estimates of the longevity and cost of the pandemic are necessarily long on assumptions and short on facts. At the moment projections for consumption and GDP in the second quarter rely on extrapolation from the partial impact in March. For April's numbers and probably those of May as well, that seems a reasonable basis for speculation, but beyond that the variables depend on facts that are in constant flux. There is growing public pressure in many states that are far from the epicenter in New York and have never seen many virus cases or deaths to permit a return to work. As the financial situation of many people becomes ever more straitened, those demands will only rise in volume. In the international arena the US dollar will keep its safety status until there is clear evidence not only that the pandemic is ebbing but that the world's economy can successfully restart.
