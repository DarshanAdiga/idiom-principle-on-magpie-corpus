CLINTON - When Libbi Fair visited it Grand Valley State University's campus last fall it was cold, windy and raining. She hardly noticed.
 "It was still so beautiful," she said. "The campus was like a little community. I fell in love with it."
 Fair, who was named the Daily Telegram's softball Player of the Year after an outstanding sophomore season last year, has verbally committed to play softball starting in 2022 for the Lakers. She still has a season to go with the Clinton Redskins, but is ready to focus on getting better rather than choosing a college.
 "It felt right," Fair said. "It's the perfect fit for me. I'm excited that it's out of the way. I can focus on high school ball, school and my family. It's a weight off my shoulders."
 Fair debuted as a freshman on the Clinton varsity three seasons ago as the Redskin starting catcher. She was an all-conference, all-county and all-state choice after hitting .543 in the regular season with 64 hits, 12 doubles, 10 triples, 58 RBI and crossing the plate 58 times. She also caught for Clinton ace Renee Hoffman.
 Last season, with Hoffman graduated, Fair not only was the Redskin regular catcher, she also was called upon to pitch. She picked up a save in the District final as the Redskins captured their 14th straight district crown.
 Clinton coach Kim Phillip said Fair would do whatever it takes to win.
 "It's tough to pull an All-State catcher from her position to do some pitching, and she hadn't pitched since she was maybe 12, and was willing to come into the offseason knowing that's not what she's going to do in the future. It was what we needed as a team to succeed and that's just the kind of kid she is.
 "She's not selfish, she plays completely selfless and just does whatever she can to help our team win."
 Fair ended up posting a .560 batting average in the regular season last year, before hitting .786 in the postseason and finishing with 61 hits. She also had 50 RBIs, 12 doubles, six triples and four homeruns.
 Like everybody, Fair was looking forward to this season before it was wiped out due to the Covid-19 restrictions. She probably would have split time behind the plate and in the circle.
 "I was going to actually pitch a lot," she said. "I love pitching. That's what I was up until I started catching my freshman year. Whatever I have to do for me team, I will do."
 Fair said the Redskins were looking forward to another strong season.
 "I definitely was looking to improve this year and grow as a team," Fair said. "It was going to be a different type of year. We figured out last year that we could win without Renee. We made it work and improved."
 Fair was recruited by Grand Valley and other schools as a catcher, which is her favorite position. She's thrown out nearly 20 would-be base stealers over the past two seasons.
 Grand Valley, which is located near Grand Rapids in Allendale, made it to the World Series last season and its coaching staff earned recognition following the season. They were off to a 13-3 start this season when the season was canceled. Among the players on the Laker roster is Blissfield graduate Brooke Henning.
 "They are a really successful program," Fair said. "They like to win. I want to play for a successful team and program. The coach has been really successful."
 Fair credits her family, including father A.C. Fair, coaches Phillip, Donny Dreher and Bill Kunkle, plus her teammates for helping her become the players she has become.
 Fair's summer ball season is still up in the air. She had a call with the coaches and players from the Crush, her travel team, recently and they discussed playing in some summer or even fall tournaments, but even that was unsure. For now, she's working out at home with a tee and net to stay sharp.
 "I started playing little league when I was 9," she said. "I've played every year since. It's so different not playing."

"The new show is a lot calmer, a lot quieter. Entertainment programmes these days are generally quick quick quick, edits, noises, and actually, it's forced programmes like that to be innovative and different. I'm actually enjoying some elements of the new Graham Norton Show, but you've just got to see it as a different sort of programme."
 Taylor notes: "It often depends on the skill of the presenter, and [Norton] is one of the best broadcasters in the country, same with Ant and Dec, they can make it work because they're so good."
 It's difficult to quantify how audience-free formats are affecting viewing figures. Question Time's ratings _have_ significantly increased, but that will have been influenced by other factors too - not least the show's earlier timeslot, the busy news agenda, and the fact most of us are stuck at home.
 A captive audience has meant improved viewing figures across the board - a recent episode of Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway which filmed without an audience actually recorded the show's highest ever ratings of 9.5 million.
 How long will this be the new normal? It's difficult to say, because even if lockdown measures were eased somewhat in the coming weeks, some form of social distancing could well remain in place - which presents problems for producers.
 "If it lasts to the end of the year, then you think about programmes like Strictly," says Taylor. "In Germany they've been filming that without an audience, but would they do that here? There are a lot of questions that actually not only do the government not yet have the answers to, but TV producers don't have the answer to."

Kyle Palmieri has been trying to keep busy around his Long Island home, doing a lot of painting projects. Walls and ceilings, mostly. As for a bright picture of the NHL resuming play, the New Jersey Devils forward isn't sure. “Hopefully, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel where we’re going to be returning and finishing our regular season,” Palmieri said Monday in a conference call. The NHL has not released plans for resuming the season, or even opening team facilities to get players in shape. The NBA on Monday pushed back the possible reopening date of some team practice facilities for at least a week until May 8 at the earliest. “I think the biggest challenge is obviously not really knowing if there’s an end or when the end is going to be or if we’re returning to playing or not,\" Palmieri said. “But right now, I mean, a lot of that’s out of our control. It’s all you can really do is stay at home and try and stay safe and make sure that you’re doing whatever you can to support the people who are out there fighting this disease,\" he said. Palmieri is one of the Devils' representatives in the players' union, along with goaltender Cory Schneider. Palmieri has stayed in touch with the union on a regular basis and relayed information to his teammates. “You want to keep that banter going and guys are staying in touch and doing whatever we can to make it feel a little more normal,” the Devils' leading scorer said. There have been some reports the NHL might return at some point with with only the top 24 teams finishing a shortened regular season. If that was the case, the Devils (28-29-12) would see their season end. The Devils have 68 points and 13 games left, and are 13 points out of a wild-card playoff spot. “I think guys are trying to do...

This is a question of allegiance either to the law of the land or to religion. Religion and law are not the same. We must bear in mind that every religion is bound and regulated by the law. Religion does everything to make sure people don’t separate so as to sustain the values of marriage but what happens when marriage becomes toxically dysfunctional? When it becomes apparent that the two can no longer live together, there is always a venue to explore the provisions of the law to file for separation or divorce. Marriage and divorce are extensions of constitutional freedom of association. Constitutionally, you have the right to choose who to live with and the right to call it quit to preserve life, sanity and to ward off abuse.

Note that the mandate of academics in the university includes teaching, supervision, research and development, community service and so on. Active non-compliance means that we are active in service but not compliant in the area of teaching. It is supposed to be a quiet action that should be resolved within the shortest possible time. It has implications that it may end in suspension or degenerate into a total, comprehensive and indefinite strike.

Question Time's new format sees the socially-distanced panel take questions from viewers at home, rather than its studio audience.
 The fact the panellist can then deliver their answer without heckling arguably removes some element of scrutiny - the audience's reaction often has the effect of holding an individual to account, as the speaker is forced to respond to it.
 But many viewers and panellists feel not having an audience has improved the level of debate.
 Former Today editor Roger Mosey said the show had been "revitalised", adding the speakers "no longer have to face a baying crowd of people seeking their own minute of fame".
 After Question Time's first audience-free episode aired, Piers Morgan said: "I actually preferred it, it didn't have the bear pit element that it's become. I've done Question Time more than 20 times and instinctively you kind of treat it like theatre, you play to the audience, you go in for your applause line.
 "But when they're not there, you actually have to be different, you can't play to the gallery. You have to only play to the people there. I learned more from [watching] that Question Time than any of the recent shows for a few years, it was interesting."
 The BBC said live studio interaction and hearing from the general public are key parts of Question Time, but added it's pleased the programme has been able to make the new format work.

Employees are therefore required to bring personal face coverings for their nose and mouth area when they come to work."

Chicago Blackhawks president and chief executive John McDonough was sacked on Monday, with team management saying they wanted to use the coronavirus shutdown to set a new course for the National Hockey League franchise.
 McDonough, a pillar of sports in Chicago who had spent 25 years with the Chicago Cubs baseball team before joining the Blackhawks in 2007, was widely credited with helping transform the NHL outfit.
 Under McDonough the Blackhawks won Stanley Cups in 2010, 2013 and 2015, comfortably the most successful era in the team's history.
 However, in a statement on Monday Blackhawks chairman Rocky Wirtz said the suspension of the NHL season had prompted a rethink.
 "Thirteen years ago, I recruited John to the Blackhawks because of his leadership, direction and vision," Wirtz said.
 "John brought all of that to the table and more. His contributions went well beyond leading the team to three Stanley Cup Championships. He rebuilt the front office and helped guide the organization toward a winning vision.
 "As difficult as this is, we believe it was the right decision for the future of the organization and its fans."
 McDonough was also instrumental in turning the Blackhawks into a commercial juggernaut. The team had sold out a record 531 consecutive home games prior to the COVID-19 shutdown.
 Wirtz said the coronavirus crisis and the league suspension had prompted a review of the team's management.
 "While we can reassure our fans there will be hockey again, no one knows what that will look like," Wirtz said.
 "What we do know is that it will take a new mindset to successfully transition the organization to win both on and off the ice."
 Wirtz's son Danny Wirtz, 43, will serve as interim team president as the hunt for McDonough's replacement gets under way, a statement said.

TYLER, Texas (KLTV) - With today’s announcement from Governor Greg Abbott, some stores and retailers in Texas are now able to open up with certain restrictions.Certain businesses like hair salons and barbershops, however, are not allowed to open for at least another two weeks.“I don’t think its fair for them to open up a portion of it and don’t open up it all,” said Maharold Peoples, the owner of Peoples’ Unisex Barbershop in Jacksonville.Abbott announced, today, that as of May 1, retail stores, malls, restaurants and movie theaters will be able to open with a 25 percent limit on capacity.“With retail, there are ways to social distance, you can stay six feet away from other patrons in a store,” said Caycie Lopez, the owner of Headquarters Salon in Tyler. “In a salon setting, there is no way to stay six feet away from your client and from the stylist that you’re working with, it’s a very close environment. So, from that stand point, I understand it completely.”Abbott said if data shows no COVID-19 influxes after two weeks of the limited openings, those businesses can operate at a 50 percent capacity and gyms, bars, salons and barbershops can open in mid-May.“My first, initial reaction was disappointment, to be completely honest,” said Lopez. “I was really hoping for Friday, or the latest, Monday but I understand why. I understand the reason behind it, it’s just disappointing. We’re ready to get back to our clients and coworkers and get back to everyday life.”Salon and barbershop owners across East Texas are frustrated with the decision.“I got to be on the job to make a dollar, I got to have a head to make a dollar,” said Peoples. “I can’t make a dollar in my house, so I have to be there to work, in order to survive.”“I don’t really have any concerns, I’ll trust the medical community to basically instruct us how we need to handle things properly, but I think, to me, masks will do,” said Michelle Oliver, a cosmetologist in Lufkin. “Our industry, that’s where we have our education based on, sanitation and sterilization. So, if we go through those motions of sanitation and sterilization with each client, then we should be taking care of things like that better than most industries would.”Abbott said while his new instructions allow businesses to reopen, it doesn’t mean they have to if they don’t feel safe.He said his reopening phases are based on current models by stores like HEB and Home Depot, and he hopes to open barbershops and salons as soon as it is medically safe to do so.Copyright 2020 KLTV.

The scale of oil market turbulence is on stark display along the California coast. About three dozen massive oil tankers are anchored from Los Angeles and Long Beach up to San Francisco Bay, turning into floating storage for crude oil that is in short demand because of the coronavirus.
 About 20 million barrels of crude are on board the tankers, according to Reid I'Anson, global commodity economist at Kpler, a data company. "That is definitely far outside what is normal for the region," he says, referring to California's coastline. "Typically, we'll not see more than, you know, maybe 5 million barrels tops kind of floating."
 With dramatically fewer cars on the road and planes in the sky, I'Anson says there is a limited need recently for gasoline and jet fuel. That has caused a glut in the market and a shortage of onshore storage.
 Keeping oil on tankers is not optimal. "It's very expensive to hold this crude on these vessels," I'Anson says. But there are few alternatives. "What else are you going to do? There's nowhere else you can take this crude ... globally, no one needs crude right now."

I tend to avoid Civil War games, as they often leave me flat (the sociocultural impacts are always muted, but also never far from the mind here in the South). I also don't enjoy many WWI games, but I'm always willing to give another one a try. The games I enjoy playing the most are those that pose interesting tactical challenges that I haven't otherwise studied, and US military doctrine, as well as the most common threat doctrines, from AirLand Battle forward, I've got some pretty intimate knowledge of (I was not just a Armor officer, but also served in the OPFOR and deputized as an Intel guy in 2 different units).

Boeing's CEO said Monday that it will take years for the aircraft- building business to return to levels seen before the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed air travel to a trickle and led airlines to park 2,800 jets. “We are in an unpredictable and fast-changing environment, and it is difficult to estimate when the situation will stabilize,” David Calhoun told shareholders, “but when it does, the commercial market will be smaller and our customers’ needs will be different.” Boeing was in crisis before the pandemic. The grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, after two crashes that killed 346 people sent the company spinning last year to its first money- losing year in two decades and battered its reputation. The virus outbreak has added to Boeing's troubles by causing airlines to delay or cancel plans to buy new jets. The virus also caused Boeing to shut down assembly plants for several weeks, although it recently reopened in the Seattle area and announced Monday that it will resume production in a South Carolina plant in less than a week. Boeing is expected to apply for a share of $17 billion in low-interest loans that Congress and the Trump administration set aside for defense companies. “We know we are going to have to borrow more money in the next six months in order to get through this really difficult moment” and help suppliers, Calhoun said without detailing where or how much Boeing will borrow. The Chicago-based company will report first-quarter results on Wednesday, and analysts surveyed by FactSet expect a loss of more than $500 million, or $1.57 per share. Because of the pandemic, the shareholder meeting was held online. Shareholders approved a slate of 12 company-backed nominees for the board despite recommendations from two proxy...

The White House has rolled out steps aimed at increasing testing capacity at the press conference today and the Hill reports that a US health official said that theUS will 'easily' conduct 8 million coronavirus tests in May. However, the Hill notes that this will still fall short ofthe amount leading health experts say is needed to safely reopen the economy. Lead Paragraphs "According to the governors plans for next month, we will easily double that 4 million number," Brett Giroir, an assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, said during a press conference at the White House. He said the administration would be sending out more of the key testing items that have been in short supply recently, including 20 million swabs and 15 million tubes needed to transport samples. However, 8 million tests in May would still fall well short of the amount leading health experts say is needed to safely reopen the economy. Key notes Harvard researchers said last week that at least 500,000 tests per day, or about 15 million tests per month are needed. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, recently said the country's needs are "closer to" 3 million tests per week, or about 12 million per month. Market implications The mood has been upbeat at the start of this week on the notion that some nations, and some parts of the US, will be easing self-distancing measures with a view to getting businesses back to work.

The move makes Kenseth teammates again with Kurt Busch — they were teammates at Roush early in their careers — and in a Chevrolet in the Cup Series for the first time for Kenseth.
 Kenseth began his racing career in 1988 in a Camaro and made his debut in the NASCAR Southeast Series in 1994 behind the wheel of a Chevrolet, and continued racing Chevrolets in the Xfinity Series through the 2001 season.
 “I know I have a lot of work ahead of me to get up to speed in a relatively short period of time, but I’m looking forward to the challenge,” Kenseth said. “I started my career in a Camaro and I can’t wait to finally race a Chevy in the Cup Series. I also need to thank Chip and all his partners for this opportunity. Hopefully we will be on the track soon.”
 Kenseth drove Fords for Roush and Toyotas for Gibbs. He was Cup rookie of the year in 2000 driving for Roush, where he won his only championship. He has 39 career victories and won the Daytona 500 in 2009 and 2012.
 Kenseth joined Gibbs in 2013 and was an immediate title contender. He qualified for the playoffs — which began the year after he won the Cup title with just one win — in every season he was eligible but one.
 Kenseth won 15 races in five full seasons driving for Gibbs and was runner-up for the title in 2013, the year he won seven races.
 In choosing Kenseth, Ganassi gives his partners a low-key driver with a winning record who typically avoids controversy. He was suspended two races by NASCAR in 2015 for intentionally wrecking Joey Logano in a heated championship battle.
 “Throughout my time in NASCAR, I have always admired the way Matt Kenseth raced,” Ganassi said. “He has proven to be a consistent winner, strong competitor, and respectful driver, and I’m glad we are able to add another NASCAR champion to the team for the remainder of this season.”
 Busch won the 2004 championship in the first year of the playoff format to give Roush back-to-back titles, and now there are two former champions in the Ganassi stable.

The United States said Monday it was ready to recognize Israel's annexation of much of the West Bank but asked the new unity government also to negotiate with the Palestinians.
 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has reached a power-sharing deal to remain in office after three inconclusive elections, has vowed to press ahead with annexations that the Palestinians say will shut the door to a two-state solution.
 A Middle East "vision" unveiled in January by US President Donald Trump gave a green light to annexations, but Netanyahu's coalition deal with centrist Benny Gantz said the cabinet would consult Washington before moving forward.
 "As we have made consistently clear, we are prepared to recognize Israeli actions to extend Israeli sovereignty and the application of Israeli law to areas of the West Bank that the vision foresees as being part of the State of Israel," a State Department spokesperson said.
 The step would be "in the context of the Government of Israel agreeing to negotiate with the Palestinians along the lines set forth in President Trump's Vision," she said.
 Trump, whose evangelical Christian base is staunchly pro-Israel, has granted a wish-list to Netanyahu over the past three years.
 His Middle East plan would let Israel annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank -- which the rest of the world considers illegal -- and exert sovereignty all the way to Jordan.
 The Palestinians would be granted a sovereign but demilitarized state along with promises of major investment.
 The Palestinian state's capital would be on the outskirts of Jerusalem, the contested holy city which would remain fully under Israeli sovereignty.
 "This is an unprecedented and highly beneficial opportunity for the Palestinians," the State Department spokesperson said.
 The comments expand on remarks to reporters Wednesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who said annexation was ultimately "an Israeli decision."
 The Palestinians have refused to negotiate with the Trump administration, considering it biased, and the European Union has also criticized Trump's plan as failing to achieve a two-state solution.
 The Arab League plans to hold a virtual meeting this week to discuss the annexation plan, which under the Israeli coalition deal could happen as soon as July.

Edmonds is continuing that family tradition as a two-sport standout for the Flucos. A two-year starter at quarterback and point guard, he’s led Fluvanna County’s football team to back-to-back regional playoff appearances for the first time in more than two decades.
 “Some people say it is difficult to be a two-sport performer, but I think it’s easy because I grew up around sports and being active,” Edmonds said. “If you have goals, prepare mentally and stay focused, there is nothing that should ever stop you from completing the task at hand at that moment.”
 The 16-year-old started playing organized sports at the age of four. In addition to football and basketball, he tried baseball for about five years, but found out that it was not the sport for him. He said his parents, Anthony and Sharon, encouraged him to get involved in sports at an early age and that exposure helped prepare him for future opportunities.
 “I always played against kids two years older than me to get better,” Edmonds said. “It was a must in my household because my parents wanted me to be better than average.”
 That thirst for improvement started early on when Edmonds watched his dad coach the Fluvanna County Rockets, a local AAU basketball team.
 “I used to go with him to practice all the time and asked him a load of questions,” Edmonds said. “I would try to mock everything I saw. I would get on his nerves a lot, but I will say he did take the time to answer my questions, which seemed silly at the time.”
 Those lessons served Edmonds well two years ago when he made the jump to high school and quickly became an impact performer at Fluvanna County. As a freshman he was named starting quarterback and guided the Flucos to their first playoff appearance in more than a decade.
 That winter, Edmonds took over as the starting point guard on the basketball team and emerged as a rising star in the Jefferson District. He said there are a lot of similarities between the sports.
 “In both positions, you have to be a leader, no matter what, and you must always try to find ways to help motivate teammates,” he said. “They can be really tough and extremely difficult at times, but I try to keep a positive attitude and never show frustration.”
 Edmonds built off that success during his sophomore year, showing improvement in both sports.
 On the gridiron, the sophomore amassed more than 1,400 yards of total offense and was responsible for 21 touchdowns for Fluvanna County last fall. He racked up more than 200 yards of total offense and scored three touchdowns in a win over Broadway. Later in the season, Edmonds rushed for nearly 200 yards and scored three touchdowns in a big win over Albemarle to secure a playoff berth for the second year in a row.
 “Football went really well for me personally,” Edmonds said. “It was great helping lead the football team to back-to-back playoff appearances. The community, the student body, along with administrators were head over heels happy. Hopefully we can do the same thing for the next two years and host a playoff game and win a first or second-round game.”
 He’s also a big contributor on the defensive side of the ball as a safety. Edmonds was among the leading tacklers in the secondary for the Flucos and led the team in interceptions.
 The sophomore relishes the opportunity to be a two-way starter.
 “I really enjoy playing both sides,” Edmonds said. “On offense, the rush of throwing or running for a touchdown is amazing, but then on the other hand, when you can hit someone and cause a fumble or return a pick for a touchdown, is another great feeling.”

Easy to say that the numbers are declining, or that we've reached a peak or turned a corner -- your cliche goes here -- but there's not enough evidence to back that up. Deaths are declining? Tell that to the families of the 57 people who died on Monday.
 China was locked down by late-January. By late-February, the writing was on the global wall. Italy was about to be overwhelmed.
 Here at home, not much was happening.
 Fully a month later, on March 23, a statement from the Prime Minister’s office let it be known that the government would work with BlueDot through the Public Health Agency of Canada, and "use its disease analytics platform to support modelling and monitoring of the spread of COVID-19, and to inform government decision-making as the situation evolves.”
 Evolves? Any government decision-making that followed March 23 was about two months too late, but never mind.
 Despite repeated warnings (starting in January) from individuals such as Doris Grinspun, head of the RNAO, and others who lived and worked through SARS in 2003, our elected officials failed to plan and to act. There wasn’t even sufficient PPE for health-care workers.
 It is remarkable how long it took our elected leaders to make a move on the coronavirus crisis, although Mayor John Tory did shut down most of Toronto by March 13.
 There’s no excuse for what has happened in nursing homes, where hundreds have died. The experts (and just about everybody else) can tell you that the situation will be repeated throughout the homeless and prison populations — all those people closely confined, and all of them, it seems, expendable.
 Meanwhile, this province can’t even manage to pay the doctors who have closed their offices and clinics to see patients remotely. Most will go without a salary for three months.
 Is the Minister of Health, Christine Elliott, going without a salary for three months?
 Or, Merrilee Fullerton, the Minister of Long Term Care?
 When this pandemic finally subsides, people will be so glad to resume some semblance of normal life that they’ll forget how this thing played out. They’ll forget the months it took for anyone to pay attention to the evidence uncovered by BlueDot at the end of 2019.
 Most will forget how badly politicians bungled this crisis.
 Most. Not all.

President Donald Trump said Monday he expects to see a "lot" of US schools reopen after being shut down by the coronavirus pandemic.
 "Many (state governors) are thinking about their school system," Trump said at a daily White House briefing.
 "Not a long way to go in the school system right now, for this season, for this year, but I think you'll see a lot of schools open up," he said.
 "Even if it's for a very short period of time, I think it would be a good thing," Trump told reporters.
 "Young people seem to do very well," he added in an apparent reference to studies showing that children do not get as sick from the virus as older people.
 "So I know that there are some governors that aren't necessarily ready to open up their states, but they may be ready to open up their school systems," Trump said.
 "That's their choice, but the word is safety," he said. "Rapid -- but safety."
 Schools around the country have closed because of the coronavirus pandemic and many have switched to online instruction.
 The outbreak has left more than 55,000 people dead in the United States.
