Bradley has a settled squad otherwise but is keen to strengthen again if he identifies the right players. But the situation regarding Byrne will determine a lot of Rovers' post-season work.
 Asked if there is anything else Rovers can do to persuade Byrne, Bradley replied: "He has to want to stay, first of all, and that's a decision that will come down the line.
 "This club is bigger than any one individual and this goes for any manager or player.
 "All that Jack has to see are the benefits that he has enjoyed since he's been at home.
 "He's in a much happier place in his personal life and what you get from this is what you see on the pitch every week.
 "On the back of that he is in Ireland squads - four caps now, none of this would happen unless he's here. So I think this all speaks for itself.
 "We'll have to wait and see where this goes."
 Byrne, of course, came home to Dublin and joined Rovers after spells across channel with Manchester City, Wigan, Oldham and Kilmarnock by the age of 23.
 He knows that a move back to England or Scotland does not guarantee a better career.
 "Exactly," said Bradley. "And Jack has been around the football world a long time, he's seen what is out there and understands that he is not an 18 or 19 year old kid who wants to jump at an opportunity.

 # Tahanto girls advance to pod soccer championship game
 By Bill Marsh
 Item Sports Writer
 BOYLSTON – After finishing with a 16-2-2 record last season, and qualifying for the District tournament, the Tahanto Regional High School girl’s soccer team continued its winning ways this season, posting an 8-1-2 mark, and advancing to the pod championship game.
 The Stags were in a pod with West Boylston, Clinton, Ayer-Shirley and St. Bernard's.
 In light of a 24-3-4 record over the past two years, Tahanto coach, Dan Ashman, in his second year at the helm, was pleased with his team’s success, but not surprised by it.
 “We got off to a slow start, losing our first game 1-0 to West Boylston,” Ashman said. “That was a bit of a wakeup call for us, and then we went 10 games without a loss.”
 “It was a successful season, given that we got to play at all,” he said. “With how things went last year, and if we had had a normal year without any changes (due to COVID-19), I thought we had a chance for a District championship.”
 “We lost only three seniors (to graduation), and these girls worked so hard over the summer,” Ashman said. “So many of them are way better players than they were last year, and I would have loved to see how they would have done with a normal schedule.”
 One of the main reasons the Stags pocketed four consecutive league championships, and qualified for the post-season the last four years, is the play of senior Jenny McGrath, selected as the only captain on a talent-filled team.
 McGrath, the team’s leading scorer with nine goals, has played both center- back and forward this season.
 “Jenny McGrath is one tough competitor,” Ashman said. “She puts her body on the line every game and has taken some brutal hits, but never comes off the field.”
 “She’s a hard worker whether in practice, the weight room or off season,” he said. “She is not just a great athlete, but a great student, too.”
 McGrath, a three-sport athlete, who plays basketball and is on the track team, is thrilled that she was able to play soccer her final year of high school.
 “We started out slow this season with a loss to West Boylston, and that was the first time we’ve lost to them since I’ve been on the team, but we bounced back, and have been playing real well ever since,” McGrath said. “It has been tough with all the new (safety) rules, but many of us played in the French River summer league, and that helped us adjust to the season.”
 “I’m just glad we got to play,” she added.
 McGrath, a member of the National Honor Society, was both a league and Central Mass. all-star last season. She has been playing soccer for a long time, and her family has been very involved in the sport as well.
 “I played Boylston youth soccer since I was a little kid,” McGrath said. “My brother Nick (McGrath) plays for Nichols College and I got to play with my sister Jill (McGrath) when she was on the team, so soccer runs in my family.”
 The other seniors on the squad are Hailey Choquette, Rachel Donoghue, Sydney Gervais, Steph Yildiz, Elsa Keefe and Gwyn Willwerth.
 Choquette, a returning league all-star, was a defender while Donoghue played the midfield.
 “Hailey (Choquette) was another tough kid, who played center-back for us,” Ashman said. “She epitomized the want to win attitude, and pretty much played every minute of every game.
 “She (Donoghue) was the most improved player on the team,” he said. “She didn’t get a lot of playing time as a junior, but just put in a ton of work over the summer. She’s fought through some injuries this fall, but has had a great season.”
 Gervais is a forward, while Yildiz played center back.
 “Sydney (Gervais) works hard on her game,” Ashman said. “She did an awesome job playing back, and seems to always end up with the ball on her foot.
 “She is a fast, complete player, and is great with both feet,” he said. “She is also a good leader, who leads by example.”
 Elsa Keefe is a forward, while Willwerth was the backup goalkeeper.
 “Elsa (Keefe) was much improved this season,” Ashman said. “She was a starter on offense for us, and scored a couple of goals, and they were big ones. She scored the winning goal in our 2-1 win over Ayer (Shirley)
 “Gwyn (Willwerth) is probably the second-best goalie in the league,” he said. “She didn’t get to play there much this season, but was the starter her sophomore year.”
 Sophomore Laureen Wattu, a returning league all-star, who registered four shutouts this season, was the starting keeper.
 “Lauren (Wattu) started every game last year as a freshman,” Ashman said. “She allowed less than one goal a game last season, and made some incredible saves.”
 “She is so good with her feet, that we were able to use her as another offensive player,” he said. “She is just a super skilled athlete.”
 Other key members of the team were sophomore Jessica Forbes, who was the team’s leading scorer last season with 23 goals, junior Jordan Money, a returning league all-star, and sophomore Autumn Bella, also a returning league all-star.
 Forbes, a returning league and Central Mass. all-star, was a striker, while Money was an outside midfielder. Bella is a defensive midfielder.
 “Jess (Forbes) scored in 16 of our 20 games last year,” Ashman said. “She is a difference maker and the other teams have to pay so much attention to her. She was out early in the season this year with an injury, but her first game back was the turning point in the season for us.
 “Jordan Money has had two great years,” he said. “The type of game we play relies on that midfield position, and she brings a lot of energy to it.
 “Autumn (Bella) is a playmaker,” Ashman said. “She distributes the ball out of the middle real well.”
 The other juniors on the team are Paige Money and Kyndal Downing.
 Victoria Carrias, Olivia Latorre, Melanie Tolles, Carly Choquette and Lexi German are the other sophomores on the team.
 The team’s freshmen are Rylee Walton, Chloe Casperson and Gisele Uva. Eighth- grader Alison Stevens and Ally Choquette and seventh-grader Jillian Bradford were also team members.
 The Tahanto junior varsity coach was Sheena Suttlemyre.

People who are mentally unfit or have a history of offending behaviour are still being granted gun licences in Queensland, and more than 600 weapons are going missing in the state every year, an audit has found.
 Police have set up a committee to oversee gun regulation after an Queensland Audit Office report found the existing system is creating "an unnecessary risk to community safety".
 The report said the problems were mainly due to inadequate enforcement and compliance checks by police.
 "QPS does not have the right balance between affording procedural fairness for licence applicants and managing community safety," auditor-general Brendan Worrall wrote.
 "It sometimes grants firearm licences to people with a history of offending behaviour that may be a risk to public safety."
 The auditor-general said there were almost 186,000 firearms licences and almost 830,000 registered firearms in 2019.
 He warned that the police were granting licences to people when there were concerns about their suitability.
 Mr Worrall said under existing rules the Weapons Licensing Unit only denies licences to applicants if they had been charged with certain offences and if that had happened in the previous five years.
 That meant people with a history of offending behaviour, but no convictions, can still being granted gun licenses.
 The report found that police failed to adequately monitor licence-holders.
 More than 78 per cent who were granted licences between 2015-2019 have never been inspected.
 Almost 65 per cent of licence-holders have gone 11 years or more before their first inspection.
 Mr Worrall found that police weren't consistent in seizing guns either, which created "an unnecessary risk to community safety".
 There were numerous cases of police failing to recover guns from licence- holders who had died, and of allowing unsuitable people to access guns through relatives and associations.
 "Sometimes these delays meant that the firearms could not be located, and some are still unaccounted for," the report said.
 "Consequently, QPS is ineffective in ensuring all firearms are accounted for."
 The number of guns stolen in Queensland has also risen by seven per cent per year from 601 in 2015 to 643 in 2019.
 The audit report found that the Weapons Licensing Unit doesn't proactively monitor gun dealers and the state's firearms register is not accurate or up to date.
 Mr Worrall said parts of the register were on paper and not in a centralised digital system.
 "The firearms register is no longer fit for purpose," he wrote.
 The auditor-general made 13 recommendations including creating a fit-for- purpose gun register that can be updated in real time, and making risk-based inspections of licence-holders.
 It was also recommended that non-compliance was monitored, reported and acted upon within a reasonable timeframe.
 The audit report said the Weapons Licensing Unit should be immediately notified electronically from dealers about the sale, transfer and disposal of guns.
 Deputy Police Commissioner Tracy Linford said the QPS accepted all 13 recommendations and would work to implement them through the new oversight committee.
 "The QPS is committed to implementing all recommendations, especially those which promote the safe and effective regulation of firearms in Queensland," she said in a statement.
 "Finding the necessary balance between community safety and the rights of the lawful firearm owning community will continue to be the focus of the QPS as action items are implemented and assessed."
