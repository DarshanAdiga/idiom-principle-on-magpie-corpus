Worried by the recent reports of two persons committing suicide in north Bengal after receiving invitations to join online killer game 'Momo Challenge', the state administration has started taking precautionary steps to combat the threat, but the suicides of young lives need much more than the probe or directives. Suicide has been linked to mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, and alcoholism and drug abuse, broken relationships, work pressure and some may use it as a tool to blackmail or weaken the opposite side. It is said that death only needs an excuse, and it is true. But suicide isn't just a state of mind that develops overnight. It's a lingering thought in the person's life, and finally, when they hit rock bottom, they don't see the end of the tunnel anymore, and they call their final shots. At that moment, living becomes much harder than death could ever be for them. Anyways, these days it has become very common and sometimes it has become a tool to take revenge. When it comes to teenage lives, I get more worried because they have over choked emotions but hardly any source to vent it out. Here comes the role of the internet. From birth to death, you have many ways to discover and end your life.

For year-to-year verbal leases, the Nebraska Supreme Court has ruled that the lease year begins March 1. Notice to a tenant to vacate under a verbal or handshake year-to-year lease (legally referred to as a "notice to quit") must be given six months in advance of the end of the lease, or no later than Sept. 1. This rule applies regardless of the crop planted. Those with winter wheat should consider providing notice before it is time to prepare wheat ground for planting.
 For example, for the lease year beginning March 1, 2020, and ending Feb. 28, 2021, notice from the landlord that the lease will be terminated would have to be given to (and received by) the tenant no later than Sept. 1, 2020. The lease would then expire Feb. 28, 2021, with the new tenant (or new buyer) able to take over the lease March 1, 2021. If, however, the notice to quit were given (or received) after Sept. 1, 2020, the existing tenant would have the lease until Feb. 28, 2022.
 It is recommended that the farmland lease be terminated by Registered Mail. This means that the person receiving the letter signs for it, providing evidence that the termination notice was received.

INDIANAPOLIS — Marco Andretti was 2 months old the last time his venerable racing family led the field to green at the Indianapolis 500. In this strange pandemic-plagued season, he ended a 33-year Andretti drought by winning the pole.
 That darned “Andretti Curse” has haunted three generations of racers at Indianapolis Motor Speedway since 1969, when Mario Andretti won his only Indy 500. Now his grandson, with a lightning-fast and fearful four laps around the speedway, has cleared the first hurdle toward an elusive victory.
 Mario Andretti was 1 for 29 in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing," with just three career poles, his last in 1987. His son, Michael, never won a pole and his best finish in 16 tries was second in 1991. Jeff Andretti went 0 for 3. John Andretti was 0 for 12 and Marco currently is 0 for 14.
 In his 15th attempt, he will attempt to end that stupid family curse once and for all.
 The last of nine drivers Sunday to make a qualifying run, Marco Andretti logged a four-lap average of 231.068 mph to bump five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon from the pole. Andretti worried about the wind all morning and relied on advice his grandfather has long given the racers of the family to find the courage to hold it wide open for four laps around one of the most famous tracks in motorsports.
 “The wind will scare you, but it will never crash you," Marco Andretti said, quoting his grandfather after his run.
 He seemed to have tears in his eyes and his hands appeared to briefly shake as driver after driver congratulated him on pit lane. Then came a strong embrace with his father, owner of the six Andretti entries in the rescheduled Aug. 23 race.
 “Obviously I was emotional. We put so much into it. This place means so much to us as a family,” Marco Andretti said. "We’ve just been through so many ups and downs at this place. Obviously my (late) cousin John is riding with me, my grandfather from home.
 “We know family is pulling for us. We live and breathe this sport, this race in particular.”
 At his home in Pennsylvania, 80-year-old Mario Andretti said he was "never so nervous in my life” as he watched his grandson's run on television.
 “I'm happier now than I've ever been," Andretti said on NBC Sports. “I jumped so high I hit my head on the ceiling and it's a 9-foot ceiling. He knows what he needs to do to get the best out of the car and minimize mistakes. He's seriously focused on winning the 500.”
 In a normal year, Marco Andretti would have received a thunderous ovation after his run. But the coronavirus pandemic forced new track owner Roger Penske to keep the gates closed for the first time in the 104-year history of the race. Spectators showed even during the Great Depression, but this year, only a small gathering in a gravel parking lot across the street from the speedway peeked through a fence opening between the grandstands as Andretti set a blistering pace.
 “An Andretti on the pole at Indianapolis — too bad we couldn’t hear the crowd explode,” teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay said. Team Penske's drivers, watching from inside the garage, were among the rivals who celebrated Andretti's moment.
 The Andretti organization had four of the nine spots in Sunday's shootout for the pole and a shot at sweeping the front row. But the speed the team showed Saturday dropped off for Hunter-Reay, James Hinchcliffe and Alexander Rossi, and it was Dixon at 231.051 mph who jumped to the top of the board.
 “Man, I didn't think we had a chance,” Michael Andretti said.
 But his son kept it wide open in an effort of bravery in windy conditions on a warm racetrack. Marco Andretti was ninth in order, aware of the number Dixon had posted, and refused to flinch.
 “Honestly Marco was the guy I was hoping for because I think he deserved it,” said Dixon, who was beat for the pole and later spun during the Sunday afternoon practice.
 “That’s a hard situation to go into, especially being last up and everything is on the line. We threw up a decent number. It wasn’t going to be easy to beat.”
 Andretti will sit on the front row alongside two former Indy 500 winners. Dixon of Chip Ganassi Racing qualified second and Takuma Sato was third for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.
 Rinus VeeKay, a 19-year-old rookie for Ed Carpenter Racing, was fourth and the only Chevrolet driver in the fast nine. Hunter-Reay and Hinchcliffe filled out the second row. Alex Palou, a rookie for Dale Coyne Racing, was seventh and will start alongside Graham Rahal and Rossi.
 Positions 10 through 33 were set in Saturday qualifying, when Honda dominated and Chevrolet struggled to match the same speed. It meant none of the four Team Penske entries had a chance at the pole Sunday and reigning series champion Josef Newgarden in 13th is the highest-starting Penske driver. Defending race winner Simon Pagenaud starts 25th.
 Marco Andretti, meanwhile, has a full week to absorb his pole-winning run; the pressure will undoubtedly mount as he's now the favorite to win the Indy 500. His family had suffered tremendous heartbreak at this track, the curse unable to be broken in 51 years.
 “I'm hoping the Andretti curse doesn't exist in August,” he said.

WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — When Bernie Sanders takes the Democratic National Convention’s virtual stage, it will almost certainly be his last hurrah in presidential politics. In many ways, though, Sanders is at the height of his power. Sanders’ signature ideas on single-payer health care, tuition-free college and remaking the economy to combat climate change — dismissed as radical when he first began running for president in 2015 — are now part of the mainstream Democratic debate. And, in a series of congressional races around the country, challengers from the left have unseated old-guard Democratic incumbents. The progressive movement is not a driving force in Democratic politics, but it nonetheless remains on the rise.

GARDEN CITY--A few uneasy moments darkened the hours leading up to Luther Fry's first cataract surgery, but it wasn't because his firstborn son, Eric Fry, was holding the knife.


   


  This time, Luther was the patient, after performing nearly 50,000 such surgeries in his illustrious 46-year career.


   


  "I wasn't worried about (Eric) doing the surgery. I've watched videos of his surgeries fairly often. I don't think anybody in the country is better at it, and most of them don't do as well," the elder ophthalmologist said.


   


  After all, Luther had a hand in his son's training, conducting, "Cataract Boot Camp" on weekends while Eric was in ophthalmology residency at the University of Kansas Medical School.


   


  Luther and his wife, Ardis Fry, started a medical practice together in 1974, one that made them both revered around the nation and world, then came full circle when son, Eric took the reins.


   


  Like his patients, Luther's sight had waned a bit over the years.


   


  "I just gradually, over a period of years, started having problems; glare at night with car lights," he said. "That was the thing that pushed me into it."


   


  Eric had checked his eyes annually for several years.


   


  "About six months ago, it had gotten worse and Eric said, 'That's it,' " Luther said.


   


  Cataracts in both eyes had to be removed.


   


  As a sort of covert test during weeks leading up to his surgery, Luther was scheduled as a "secret patient," at the clinic, just west of the Fry Eye Associates surgery center in Garden City. Eric, 45, who joined the practice in April 2008, prepared to operate on Dad, who happens to be the eyesight aficionado of southwest Kansas and beyond.


   


  The surgery went like clockwork and both the experience and the results were spectacular to the 78-year-old Fry.


   


  "It was a piece of cake," Luther said. "My vision is great. Both eyes are good, but it's hard to get used to not wearing glasses. I've worn them since the third grade (in Montezuma, southwest of Dodge City)."

Melissa Barrera will join Courteney Cox and David Arquette in _Scream 5_ , the horror relaunch releasing 25 years after the Wes Craven-directed original. The 30-year-old _In The Heights_ and _Vida_ star is the first new cast member to be added to the sequel, which hands over the reins to _V/H/S_ and _Ready or Not_ directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett following Craven's death in 2015. Craven helmed the four _Scream_ films between 1996 and 2011, all starring Cox and Arquette as Gale and Dewey Riley, who work with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) to halt a series of slayings carried out by the masked Ghostface killers.


  Details behind Barrera's role, first reported by _Deadline_, have not been revealed. Barrera confirmed the news on her Instagram story and is just the third cast member to be added ahead of a planned late 2020 shooting start in Wilmington, North Carolina.


  In May, Campbell confirmed "conversations" with the film's creative team, which counts James Vanderbilt ( _Zodiac_ , _The Amazing Spider-Man_ ) and Guy Busick ( _Ready or Not_ , _Castle Rock_ ) as screenwriters. Campbell has not yet boarded the new movie, admitting to feeling apprehensive over a _Scream_ without Craven.


  "I had really thought that the only way I'd step into a new project with new directors is if they really wanted to honor him. So, we'll see," Campbell told _The Hollywood Reporter_. "We're just in the beginning phases of negotiations, and we'll have to see where it goes with COVID and everything. There are a lot of things up in the air such as when we'll actually get to make the movie and how we can even reenter this business at the moment."


  Earlier this month, Arquette told _ComicBook.com_ he hopes to reunite with Campbell on the project expected from Spyglass Media and Paramount Pictures in 2021.


  "I love playing the character Dewey. It's had such an important role in my life," Arquette said. "As an actor, you try to do films that work, that entertain people, that audiences get a kick out of. You seldom do something for a small audience, to talk to a very niche group. The horror fan base is huge so when you really connect with them, and then it even goes beyond that, it's a really special thing."

  "When [the directors] approached me, I was in first, and now we've got Courteney on board, hopefully, Neve will join the team and then we can shoot this thing," he added.

President Donald Trump is again threatening to send federal agents to New York City if local authorities don't stop a surge of violence that has left seven people dead and more than 50 people shot since Friday.Trump, who's running for re-election on a law-and-order agenda as a counterweight to the police and criminal justice reform movement, reacted to the news of the mayhem in his hometown Sunday night on Twitter."Law and Order," Trump wrote, directing his message at the city's Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio. "If (he) can't do it, we will!" It was the latest in a string of bloody weekends that have roiled the city in the wake of coronavirus- related shutdowns, rallies against police brutality and a month-long protest encampment in front of City Hall.According to police, 51 people were shot from Friday through Sunday, six of whom died from their injuries. Another man died after a physical altercation, police said.Eight people were shot and five people were killed over the same span last year.De Blasio on Monday dismissed Trump's tweet as "bluster," telling reporters that a recent uptick in gun arrests was a hopeful sign that the NYPD "will turn this tide." De Blasio's press secretary, Bill Neidhardt, noted that Trump sent his tweet hours after retweeting a pundit who said Democratic cities should be left to rot.Trump has used violent spikes in Democratic-led cities such as New York, Chicago and Philadelphia to justify claims that recent reforms and cuts to police budgets have handcuffed officers and allowed criminals to run amok. His re-election campaign has been airing farcical television commercials suggesting no one will be there to answer 911 calls if his Democratic rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is elected president."The only thing rotten is Trump's mind," Neidhardt tweeted in response.Trump, a Republican who grew up in Queens and built his namesake tower on Manhattan's chic Fifth Avenue, backed off a threat last month to send federal agents to New York City to deal with protesters and increased violence, as he had in Portland, Oregon.De Blasio had said the city would take legal action to stop such a move and Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Trump told him by telephone that he wouldn't send any extra federal law enforcement personnel to the city without discussing it with the governor first.Trump's emphatic loyalty to the men and women in blue -- "We love our police!" he's bellowed at rallies -- and his aversion to some of the many reforms enacted across the U.S. after the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd in May has translated into increased support from the law enforcement community.On Friday, Trump received the endorsement of New York City's largest police union, the Police Benevolent Association. At a ceremony with the union's leaders at his New Jersey golf course, Trump said recent changes to state and city laws governing officer conduct and accountability have "totally taken away their incentive." New York state lawmakers in June repealed a decades-old law that had kept police disciplinary records a secret. They also banned officers from using chokeholds. City lawmakers went a step further, ordering officers to avoid the torso while making an arrest."They've taken away their lives, in a sense, because they don't allow them to do their job," Trump said.New York's recent crime wave has upended years of at-or-near record lows that had city leaders touting it as the "Safest Big City in America." Still, it remains far safer than in the early 1990s, when there were more than 2,000 killings per year.This year, the city has seen a 82.1% increase in shooting incidents and a 88.5% increase in shooting victims over last year, according to police. More than 1,000 people have been shot in the city from Jan. 1 through Sunday, police said.Homicides have climbed more than 30%, to 259 as of Sunday from 199 at the same point last year.What's behind the rash of violence isn't clear.Police have blamed bail reforms that went into effect at the start of the year, but there's little evidence that police freed from jail are behind the new crimes. Mayor Bill de Blasio blamed pandemic-related courthouse closures, but court officials said they were functioning all along. (AP) PMS PMS

Fraktionssprecher Jochen Stoppenbrink, seine Ehefrau und Bürgermeisterkandidatin Dr. Kirsten Witte sowie Parteisprecher Frank Winter erklärten zwei Tage vor der nächsten Sitzung zum Thema Storck am Mittwoch im Haupt- und Finanzausschuss (ab 17.15 Uhr im Eventcenter der OWL-Arena), dass sie nicht beabsichtigen den in den Vorlagen vorgelegten Beschlüssen bereits zuzustimmen. Die Grünen sehen erheblichen Beratungsbedarf und mahnen eine intensive Befassung mit den vorliegenden Einwendungen aus der Bürgerschaft und der Umweltverbände an.

"Jason has a proven track record in helping businesses transform culturally, operationally and financially," Snyder said. "He is a proactive and assertive advocate for inclusion of all people and will set new standards for our organization, and for the league."
 The club with a storied history dating to its Boston roots in the 1930s and three long-ago Super Bowl titles is in a phase of transformation. It will be called the "Washington Football Team" for at least the 2020 season, with Terry Bateman spearheading the process to determine a new full-time name. Snyder is also seeking a new stadium to be in place when the lease at FedEx Field expires in 2027.
 Wright is the fourth former player to become a team president and does so after several years in business. He earned an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago's business school and joins the organization after working at a strategy and management consulting firm in Washington, D.C.
 He called this an "ideal opportunity and said, "I have always enjoyed building exciting new things and taking on the hard, seemingly intractable challenges that others may not want to tackle."
 Wright, like Rivera, will report directly to Snyder while overseeing Washington's operations, finance, sales and marketing departments. Rivera, who was a defensive coordinator in Chicago and San Diego at the time, said he remembers Wright as a player and has grown to realize the two share many of the same values that should help them work together.
 "It is no surprise to me that he went on to achieve the caliber of success that Jason has in his time in the business world," Rivera said. "Because he knows the NFL firsthand and how fast it moves, I am excited to have him on board to head up the front office and operations."

“The 24th” had originally been slated to premiere in March at SXSW before the coronavirus pandemic canceled the festival. But it’s one of the few films that have managed to find a path forward nevertheless. On Friday, Vertical Entertainment will release it on-demand and in digital rental, two days before the anniversary of the Houston Riot, also called the Camp Logan Mutiny.
 Willmott is best known as Spike Lee’s recent co-writer. He helped pen “Chi- Raq,” “BlacKkKlansman” and their recent Netflix release, “Da 5 Bloods.” He also teaches film at the University of Kansas; the star and co-writer of “The 24th,” Trai Byers (“Empire”), was once Willmott’s screenwriting student.
 While Willmott was working on “BlacKkKlansman” -- which won him and Lee an Oscar -- he suggested Byers look over the script. Together, they believed the film had the power to educate.
 “It’s history. That was our main point. This is history. History that hasn’t been taught,” Byers said. “In order to meet these moments, we need that history, we need that point of reference. Until we know where we’ve been, how can we know who we are?”
 While the horrors of slavery have sometimes been depicted in film, the in- between decades of Jim Crow have more seldom been shown. That could be changing. The opening of HBO’s “Watchmen,” set amid the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 -- in which white mobs leveled 35 square blocks of the wealthy Black Oklahoma community known as “Black Wall Street” -- exposed many to a history they knew little about.
 “People need to know about the period after slavery. Slavery is the real sin of American life, but it didn’t end after slavery,” says Willmott. “That period after slavery, from the 1880s to the 1930s is for African Americans literally almost a Holocaust. That part of our history was really just erased from history books. Black people don’t know it, white people don’t know it. The fact that you can wipe out a whole black section of town in Tulsa -- that’s like a 9/11 for Black people -- and no one knows about it.”

New Delhi: The Delhi Assembly's peace and harmony committee on Monday said it will soon summon Facebook India executives including its public policy director Ankhi Das as it seeks to investigate alleged instances of "intentional and deliberate inaction" by the social media company to curtail hate speech by members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
 The committee, headed by Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, Raghav Chadha, said it had received "several complaints" after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 published a report titled _Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics_.
 The WSJ report alleged that Facebook executives, particularly Das, cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the BJP, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.
 Chadha said the committee will also investigate whether Facebook executives were complicit in the alleged orchestration of the February riots in northeast Delhi riots that left 53 people dead and around 400 injured.
   
   
 "Delhi Assembly's committee on peace and harmony has received several complaints emanating from a scathing article published in the WSJ. These complaints pertain to the alleged role of Facebook in deliberate and willful inaction on the part of the social media company to rein in hate speech and to impose and implement its own policies when it comes to curbing hate mongers. The complaints prima facie indicate that Facebook allegedly provided a platform for breeding communal discord. The committee has evaluated the complaints and has come to the conclusion that immediate cognisance of the matter is required. The proceedings of the committee have been set in motion from Monday," Chadha said after the first meeting of the panel on the issue.
 When contacted, Facebook declined to comment on the matter.
 Chadha said the panel shall be sending summons to Facebook executives including Das.
 "The committee shall convene its meeting this week to initiate the proceedings forthwith. The committee aims at redressing the issue at the earliest, therefore, the proceedings shall be expedited in order to put this issue to its logical conclusion. If needed, it will also give its recommendations to the Assembly. The sole intention is to ensure and promote peace and harmony in the NCT {national capital territory} of Delhi. No unholy nexus or no alliance between a social media platform and hate mongers can be allowed to breed with a view to disturbing the communal harmony in the city," he said.

Growing up in Lake Charles, Louisiana with a single mother, Mr Ledet never thought he would go to university, let alone earn a PhD in molecular oncology or go to medical school.
 As a child, he remembers combing through dumpsters with his sister to find dinner.
 "I thought growing up only rich people go to college," he says.
 He enrolled in the Navy after high school because it was "a way out".
 It was in the military where he says he started meeting people who showed him that success was possible - first in Washington, DC and then in Pensacola, Florida, where he studied to be a military cryptologic technician.
 "I started to realise that the world was more than where I was from," he says.
 In Pensacola he met his wife, who he says was instrumental in encouraging him to get an education.
 "My wife was like 'you're smart as hell you just don't know it yet'," he remembers.
 After several tours overseas, he left the Navy so that he and his wife could settle down and start a family. They moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 2009, where he enrolled to study at Southern University and A&M College, a historically black college.
 Although he had a full scholarship, he still had to work full time to make ends meet, so he started working as a security guard at Baton Rouge General Medical Center. He would attend classes during the day, and work from late afternoon to midnight, using any downtime to do his homework.
 On Saturdays after finishing his shift, he would drive all night to Pensacola, where he was stationed as a reservist.

This one is going to be different. I’m definitely involved in this latest project and I’m waiving my fee, because, you know ... daughter, but there’s no reason I can’t slingshot off my success and launch a new business.
 The wedding is going to be in my back yard, so I’m pretty sure that not only is my input needed, it’s welcomed.
 I think we wedding planners should take a hard look at the whole “walking up the aisle” cliché.
 It’s been done, people.
 My first plan was for the bride to rise from below ground on an elevator, like the guitarist in ACDC. I considered the smoke machine, but maybe we should just keep it subtle and dignified.
 Solid idea, but I’ve never built an elevator, there is a budget, and the clock is ticking. So, Plan B. Dig a pit and put a trampoline in the bottom. It would require the bride to duck for the first few bounces as she built momentum, but when she came bursting out of the ground ... talk about a crowd pleaser.
 My idea isn’t an original – I got it from the tiger/pirate trap in Swiss Family Robinson. It’s the best part of the movie, and what’s good enough for Disney is good enough for my baby girl.

New Delhi:
 Around 34,000 class 9 and 11 students who dropped out of Delhi government schools in the 2018-19 academic session will get a chance to opt for free vocational training in a field of their choice. Following the completion of the training, the trainees will receive certificates and placement opportunities.
 The pilot project will be managed by the Delhi unit of Samagra Shiksha (SS) in collaboration with the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) and Department of Training and Technical Education (DTTE).
 The Union government's Samagra Shiksha scheme is a holistic education programme functioning across the country, within the respective states' education departments.
 "Vocational training, in a field of their choice, will provide these children with a respectable way to catch up on lost education, equip them with necessary skills and increase their employability for improved livelihoods," read a circular released earlier this month signed by Rajanish Kumar Singh, special project director (SS). HT has a copy of the circular.
 The pilot project, a first of its kind under Samagra Shiksha, aims to reach out to 27,970 class 9 students, and 6,755 class 11 students who dropped out in the 2018-19 academic session.
 Kavita Rana, officer on special duty, Samagra Shiksha said, "Since the class 9 and 11 results for the previous academic session were delayed, we are starting the pilot project with these students. These children will also be in the appropriate age group for employment and internships. Once we are able to get these children skill training, we will expand the scope to all children above 14 years of age who have dropped out of school."
 The vocational training programmes offered by these institutes include courses from the garments sector, such as tailoring or stitching; beautician courses; IT sector programmes offering computer training, web-design and data-entry courses; healthcare sector programmes like nursing courses, and others.
 "We had asked schools to contact children by Monday and forward the data to district offices. Once we have the compiled data, we plan to hold a meeting with DTTE and NULM to go ahead with the project," Rana said. As per the circular, the meeting, scheduled for August 24, will also explore the feasibility of setting up vocational labs in schools for dropouts.
 Mary Jyotsna Minj, principal of a Delhi government school for girls in New Kondli, welcomed the initiative, and said it would offer scopes for children who may not opt for academics.
 "It was difficult to compile data during the pandemic, since many students have left the city and we don't know where they are. The goal is to start getting children on board at least. They will need to be motivated to bring them back into the mainstream. But there is hope for all dropouts, especially girls."
 Sarbjeet Singh, the Educational and Vocational Guidance Counsellor (EVGC) at Minj's school, said, "We pulled out old registers to get in touch with students. In our school, of 80 students, we were able to track only 60. Among these, many either moved back to their hometowns outside Delhi or are married, or are not keen on joining the course for other reasons."
 Schools have also been asked to constitute outreach teams consisting of EVGCs who can help these children opt for the right skill training, based on their aptitude.

On Tuesday, our state and our nation recognize the 100th birthday of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to our U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote.
   
 Tennessee was the 36th state to ratify the amendment, which was the number needed to mark the three-fourths required for ratification of what was then the 48 states.
   
 This historic vote was taken in the same House chamber that we use today and the one in which I once served.
   
 Congress had proposed the amendment the previous summer in June 1919. One year later, 35 of the 48 states had ratified the amendment, with four states considering holding legislative voting sessions on the issue. However, only Tennessee issued a call for a special session.
   
 That session met in August 1920 in what many knew would be a contentious vote.
   
 What ensued during that special session was dubbed the "war of the roses," with its primary battle waged in Nashville. It was called the war of the roses due to the fact that those favoring the 19th Amendment wore yellow roses on their lapels. In direct opposition, the flowers of choice for their opposition were red roses.
   
 The roses helped the suffragists count their votes. This was how they knew that they did not have enough votes at that time to secure the vote.
   
 Having been in legislative sessions where there were close votes, I can attest to the fact that the wearing of roses to indicate a "yes" or "no" would have been a very handy tool. The first roll call on the 19th Amendment was locked down in a 48 to 48 tie vote.
   
 Among legislators participating in that session was Harry Burn, a 24-year-old lawmaker from Niota. Burn was the youngest member of the General Assembly when he was elected at age 22. He had originally planned to vote no on the ratification. However, after receiving a letter from his mother asking him to do the right thing and vote in favor of the amendment, he changed his mind.
   
 Burn's vote broke the tie in favor of ratifying the amendment. The next day he told his colleagues in the House of Representatives that he changed his vote because his mother asked him to and that she had always taught him that "a good boy always does what his mother asks him to do."
   
 Although Harry's mother got all the acclaim at the time, years later, Burn expressed that it was his respect for her that really changed his mind: "I had always believed that women had an inherent right to vote. It was a logical attitude from my standpoint. My mother was a college woman, a student of national and international affairs who took an interest in all public issues. She could not vote. Yet the tenant farmers on our farm, some of whom were illiterate, could vote. On that roll call, confronted with the fact that I was going to go on record for time and eternity on the merits of the question, I had to vote for ratification."
   
 Just over a week after Tennessee's ratification, the 19th Amendment was formally adopted into the U.S. Constitution. It ended this nation's 70-year struggle over suffrage and gave all female citizens of the United States the right to vote. We are thankful that we have the opportunity to look back on such a historic day, 100 years later, and reflect on an important vote that changed our nation for women.
   
 I have a deep respect for the history that has taken place in the chambers of our House of Representatives and State Senate. It certainly is highlighted by such events as the birthday of this great day in our nation's history.

New Delhi: The Delhi Assembly's peace and harmony committee on Monday said it will soon summon Facebook India executives including its public policy director Ankhi Das as it seeks to investigate alleged instances of "intentional and deliberate inaction" by the social media company to curtail hate speech by members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
 The committee, headed by Aam Aadmi Party MLA from Rajendra Nagar, Raghav Chadha, said it had received "several complaints" after the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on August 14 published a report titled _Facebook hate speech rules collide with Indian politics_.
 The WSJ report alleged that Facebook executives, particularly Das, cited business imperatives while choosing not to apply hate speech rules to at least four individuals and groups linked to the BJP, despite them being internally flagged for promoting or participating in violence.
 Chadha said the committee will also investigate whether Facebook executives were complicit in the alleged orchestration of the February riots in northeast Delhi riots that left 53 people dead and around 400 injured.
 "Delhi Assembly's committee on peace and harmony has received several complaints emanating from a scathing article published in the WSJ. These complaints pertain to the alleged role of Facebook in deliberate and willful inaction on the part of the social media company to rein in hate speech and to impose and implement its own policies when it comes to curbing hate mongers. The complaints prima facie indicate that Facebook allegedly provided a platform for breeding communal discord. The committee has evaluated the complaints and has come to the conclusion that immediate cognisance of the matter is required. The proceedings of the committee have been set in motion from Monday," Chadha said after the first meeting of the panel on the issue.
 When contacted, Facebook declined to comment on the matter.
 Chadha said the panel shall be sending summons to Facebook executives including Das.
 "The committee shall convene its meeting this week to initiate the proceedings forthwith. The committee aims at redressing the issue at the earliest, therefore, the proceedings shall be expedited in order to put this issue to its logical conclusion. If needed, it will also give its recommendations to the Assembly. The sole intention is to ensure and promote peace and harmony in the NCT {national capital territory} of Delhi. No unholy nexus or no alliance between a social media platform and hate mongers can be allowed to breed with a view to disturbing the communal harmony in the city," he said.

  "Summertime and the livin' is easy." So go the lyrics from the melodic 1935 jazz classic "Summertime."


  It's certainly understandable why Ontarians might identify with that song right now. We're in the dog days of summer, blessed with many sunny, warm days. Lots of people are on vacation, some are at cottages, or if they can't get away, perhaps relaxing at a neighbourhood patio, playing in the park, or enjoying a round of golf.


  Sounds idyllic. But looks are often deceiving. All you have to do is go to a store to be reminded of the reality of the invisible virus plaguing the planet when you must don a mask to buy food for the BBQ or refreshments for the cooler.


  Ontario's law that requires wearing a mask in any indoor public place is a good law. It's being credited for helping to keep the number of new COVID-19 cases regularly under 100 per day in the province, as we have seen in the past week.


  But now is not the time to be fooled, or complacent. The virus is among us and it's ready for any opportunity to find new hosts.


  Exhibit A comes courtesy of the Deerhurst Resort on the shores of Peninsula Lake in Huntsville, Ont. Eleven people so far have been infected after a group of 30, comprised of several families from the Greater Toronto Area, travelled to the luxury resort over the August long weekend. Social bubbles of 10 people were burst as the vacationing families mixed freely with each other.


  Members of the group also went out for dinner down the road, to Three Guys and a Stove restaurant. Owner Jeff Suddaby immediately closed the restaurant upon receiving the news of the outbreak and was not going to reopen until his staff was tested and cleared.


  "It's the cost of doing business in a pandemic," Suddaby told the Star.


  It's also the responsible thing to do, earning praise from Toronto's chief medical officer of health, Dr. David Williams.


  "Some people were less than responsible and conscientious in handling things," Williams said last week. "You can't say 'Well, it's a holiday and we just slip, we let the standards slide.' That's not acceptable."


  This is exactly the point. We can't let standards slide now. There's too much at stake. Just look at the anxiety being played out as Ontario plans to open schools in three weeks. One of the reasons Williams has endorsed Ontario's back-to-school strategy, which has been heavily criticized by teacher unions and many parents, is because the overall infection rate has dropped. But the virus has not disappeared.


  And such irresponsible behaviour, exhibited at the Deerhurst multiple family getaway, or the notorious Brampton house parties that attracted hundreds of young people, show how quickly the situation can deteriorate.


  On Friday, Toronto Public Health warned that as many as 550 people could have been exposed to the virus through a single person at a Yonge St. strip club, who showed up for work there for four nights one week earlier this month.


  Williams had other disturbing news to share on Thursday. His office has received reports of visitors arriving from outside Canada violating the legal requirement to self-isolate for 14 days. Instead, they attended social gatherings.


  Everyone has a responsibility to say to that person, "You should not be here," Williams stressed.


  The virus is real; the consequences are not a joke. COVID-19 kills vulnerable people and can lead to long-term health consequences for those who survive. You may not be that person, but you may pass the virus on to them.


  Everyone must do their part. So many people have worked hard to do the right thing over the past five months and so few people can undo all that hard work. We must stay vigilant, no matter how tempting it is to pretend that the livin' is still easy.

"My Concord Librarian Makes my Day" and "Now I'm going to Make My Librarian's Day" ... that's what the virtual event is all about.
 Particularly at this time of pandemic and all of the restrictions in place to protect us from exposure to COVID-19, the main and Fowler Branch of the Concord Library have soared.
 On the day that the Concord Library closed because Gov. Charlie Baker announced pandemic restrictions, I was looking for reference books to use in my Private Tutoring Sessions here in town.
 At first, amidst the quiet of the readers, there was a regular announcement with no particular alarm. It stated that the library was closing early at 2 p.m. A few minutes later, a librarian came around and said to each one softly, "Take Everything you need and don't worry about the return. Just hang on to them. Everything is OK!" Of course, children had stacks of books anyway. Their parents said no. The librarian stepped in and gave the same message to the little boy, calming his fears and also stating that there were no fines because this was authorized and they would contact each patron. That child transformed his face into one large grin! "No fines," he asked. "Wow, thanks!" His relief was palpable!
 Since that day, this is what we have experienced:
 •All library programs that were face to face went to (Zoom) within a week. They even kept the same time.
 •New library cards were issued online instead of in person. You could use the ID number given by email immediately and then produce your picture ID in person when the library was open again.
 •Complimentary packs of sunflower seeds were left outside for everyone to join in on a Summer Family Gardening Project. The box next to it contained circulars that were ordinarily left on a table inside for spontaneous reading. The choices increased.
 In the second phase of Gov. Baker's plan, patrons were allowed to pick up the books ordered online and find them on the porch in brown paper bags with their names on it.
 Progress was made in Massachusetts reduction of pandemic cases such that borrowed books were now able to be returned on Tuesday and Friday in the book drop. The books would now go through a 14-day quarantine for good measure before re-circulation.
 Cards, notes, quotes, pictures and video clips can be sent directly to either branch. Donations are terrific and must be a mailed check sent directly to the library for safety.
 And if you need to have your remembrances printed, mailed or hand-delivered, text me at 339-215-9993 or email JoyceHogan@gmail.com. I will take care of it for you.
 And here's some more good news ... the response to this "Concord Librarians make my Day" Tribute has been good and some people have expressed concern on the deadline because of August vacations. It is now extended to Aug. 31.

Unsettling weather triggered an unusual warning by the weather service of a fire-induced tornado at an out-of-control forest fire that broke out north of Lake Tahoe on Saturday afternoon.
 A massive fire cloud known as a pyrocumulonimbus formed over the fire, which started east of the town of Loyalton, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Reno, Nevada. When high winds collided with the fire and whipped it into the air, a spectacular tornado-shaped spiral of flames was formed.
 The fire has burned at least 45 square miles (117 square kilometers) and triggered evacuation orders for sparsely populated communities along State Route 395 by the California-Nevada border, said Tahoe National Forest spokesman Joe Flannery.
 Firefighters aided by water-dropping helicopters and air tankers faced "extreme fire behavior," he said, and worked through the night to extinguish spot fires and protect threatened structures.
 At one point, the fast-moving fire jumped a highway and came dangerously close to a fire truck. A fire crew from Truckee tweeted a video of firefighters dragging hoses as they ran alongside a moving truck that was dodging the flames.
 Ryan Peel said firefighters created some defensive space around his slot machine distribution warehouse in Chilcoot, but he was worried the erratic winds could still put his business in the line of fire.
 "Yesterday was extremely emotional, as we were at the mercy of the wind and the unpredictability of the fire," Peel told The Associated Press. "I was stressed and terrified at the idea of losing everything I've spent my life working for."
 With zero containment and strong winds in the forecast, he said, "we are not out of the woods yet."

There seem to be fewer players fishing at Walt Disney World these days. Getting a tee time or streaming video games might not be as much of a priority as it was a few weeks ago, either.
 Summer vacation is over.
 The restart gets real now.
 The NBA playoffs start Monday, the beginning of a two-month journey to see which team will be able to say it won a championship. It would come in the most unusual, most trying season the league has ever seen because of a shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic and 22 teams eventually moving into a so-called bubble at the Disney complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, to salvage the season.
 “This is why we got here, why we worked so hard, why everyone put their egos aside and put their effort into this, so we could get to that point where we could crown a champion,” said guard Kyle Lowry of the defending champion Toronto Raptors. “The best part of the NBA season is the playoffs.”
 The Raptors are back, with realistic aspirations to repeat their title. The Eastern Conference field also includes the Milwaukee Bucks, who posted the best regular-season record for the second consecutive year and have a likely back-to-back MVP in Giannis Antetokounmpo.
 In the Western Conference, for the first time since 2015, the Golden State Warriors won’t be going to the NBA Finals — their gap year, so to speak, meant they fell to the bottom of the West as they look to reset with a healthy Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson next season, possibly with the No. 1 overall draft pick as well.
 LeBron James is back in the playoffs, after taking the Los Angeles Lakers — who couldn’t get to the postseason in his injury-marred first year in Hollywood — to the best record in the West. He’s gone to the NBA Finals in each of his last eight postseason trips; four with Miami, then four more with Cleveland.
 “We’ve been through a lot this year,” Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters last week. “But really, all of it is just a buildup to us ... going into the playoffs. So we’re here, we’re excited about it and confident in what we can accomplish.”
 The matchups: Milwaukee-Orlando, Toronto-Brooklyn, Boston-Philadelphia and Indiana-Miami in the East, with the Lakers against play-in game winner Portland, the Los Angeles Clippers against Dallas, Denver-Utah and Houston- Oklahoma City.
 Some of those clubs can say they are happy to be in the postseason. For others, only a title will do.
 “I didn’t mention that we secured the 2 seed,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. “I don’t think anybody in the locker room talked about it. We really don’t care. Like, we want to win it all. ... That’s the only thing that matters right now for us.”
 Teams have been in the bubble for nearly six weeks now, first for a couple weeks of training camp, then three scrimmages followed by eight seeding games that were critical to some clubs and little more than tuneups to others.
 The vibe was different in the opening days of bubble life. Bass fishing on the Disney campus was all the rage, more than a few players tried golf for the first time — a group from one team, perhaps not yet fully versed in golf etiquette, tried to play with nine people, compared with the typical max of four — and everything from poker tabletops to wine fridges were being shipped in to help players pass the time.
 Some gamers have put down their controls for the next few weeks; Miami’s Meyers Leonard, generally considered the best Call of Duty player in the NBA, announced that he needs a break to focus on the playoffs.
 “For now, it’s time to lock in and help my team win a championship,” Leonard said.
 There’s no travel in these playoffs, obviously. It’ll be 16 teams, with games limited to two arenas at Disney. For the first round, it’ll be four games per day at each site, meaning drama will begin in the early afternoon and continue until late in the evening.
 Outside the Disney gates, the coronavirus pandemic continues. Most NCAA sports won’t be played this fall, and college football’s hopes seem to be hanging by a thread. When the U.S. Open tennis tournament begins this month, both reigning champions — Rafael Nadal and Bianca Andreescu — will be among the many big names sitting out because of virus concerns. Baseball has dealt with outbreaks, though it continues pushing to complete its much-shortened season.
 But inside the bubble, daily testing is working and the value of the strict protocols has been proven. No players inside have had a confirmed positive test and now the best time of the NBA year is set to begin.

 According to district officials, students in some Polk School District elementary school classrooms in which a student tested positive for COVID-19 are now at home in quarantine, as are two Rockmart High School teachers who also tested positive.
 Polk School District adopted a back-to-school plan in July that instituted several procedures to try and curb the spread of COVID-19, including encouraging students to wear masks, putting new policy in place to avoid large gatherings of students and emphasizing physical distancing and increased sanitization.

Geoffrey Smith, public safety director for the city Sturgis, has been placed on administrative leave pending further investigation into a crash that occurred early Sunday, resulting in Smith being arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.


   


  Sturgis city officials confirmed early Sunday that Smith, 46, was off-duty when the vehicle he was in crashed into an SUV in the 600 block of North Lakeview Avenue. The force of the crash pushed the SUV into another car, which then struck a minivan.


   


  Smith was taken to the Sturgis Hospital emergency room for treatment of minor injuries.


   


  The St. Joseph County Sheriff's Department was called to investigate the incident. Sturgis city officials have confirmed alcohol is believed to be a factor.


   


  Smith was booked at the St. Joseph County jail shortly after 2 a.m. Sunday, on charges of driving under the influence of intoxicants, according to information released by the sheriff's department. He was released early Sunday. He is awaiting arraignment today in St. Joseph County District Court.

NEW YORK (AP) — Two men have been indicted in the 2002 slaying of hip hop artist Jam Master Jay, which until now had been one of New York City's most notorious unsolved killings, three law enforcement officials told the Associated Press on Monday.
 The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on the condition of anonymity. One of them identified the suspects as Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan. Federal prosecutors were expected to announce the charges at a news conference Monday afternoon.
 Washington, who had reportedly been living on a couch at Jay’s home in the days before his death, was publicly named as a possible suspect or witness as far back as 2007. He is currently serving a federal prison sentence stemming from a string of robberies he committed while on the run from police after Jay's death.
 In court papers filed at the time, prosecutors alleged that Washington waved a handgun around and ordered people in Jay's Queens recording studio to lie on the ground while another man killed him on Oct. 30, 2002.
 Washington “provided cover for his associate to shoot and kill Jason Mizell,” prosecutors wrote.
 Jason “Jay” Mizell, known professionally as Jam Master Jay, was a member of 1980s hip-hop sensation Run-DMC with Joseph “Run” Simmons and Darryl “DMC” McDaniel. Their hits included “It's Tricky,” “Christmas in Hollis” and the Aerosmith remake collaboration “Walk This Way.”

It's described as a game, but the Blue Whale Challenge is far from a game. Young teens who accept the challenge are encouraged to complete a series of tasks which get more and more sinister, and at the end of the game the player is urged to take their own life to "win." However, a more sinister double- suicide early in 2017 has been linked directly to Blue Whale. The game that's got parents and officials worried in India. The name Blue Whale comes from a song by the Russian rock band Lumen. Its opening lines are, "Why to scream / when no one hears / what we're talking about?" and it features a "huge blue whale" that "can't break through the net." By posting on social networks using specific hashtags or joining to particular groups, teens -- usually between the ages of 10 and 14 – get spotted by "curators," who, after vetting the potential player, set up to 50 daily tasks leading up to the ultimate one, suicide. The tasks involve cutting one and taking other risks. For the last ten days, the player needs to wake up at an appointed early morning hour, listen to music and contemplate death. Those who get cold feet and want to leave the game receive threats, often that their parents will be killed. This is what is circulated across, but yet no authentication is done about it. The Blue Whale suicide game goes by many names including 'A Silent House,' 'A Sea of Whales' and 'Wake Me Up At 4:20 am. It takes 50 days to complete and is played primarily via the website VKontakte, which is a popular social network in Russia, now the same site has come up with the English language too, to connect globally.

Produced in conjunction with the BBC, “I May Destroy You,” whose next-to-last episode will be shown Monday night, follows Coel’s breakout 2015 comedy series, “Chewing Gum,” about a sheltered religious girl determined to shed her virginity. But where the earlier show had a bright, cartoonish energy, “I May Destroy You” is darker and more complicated; it examines Arabella’s rape (and its aftermath) from the conflicting viewpoints of each person involved, and not always with the aim of tidying up a messy situation.
 The songs help illuminate that tension. Sam Miller, who codirected the series with Coel, said they explicitly avoided “underlining emotion with the music.” Instead, he said, “A lot of the time we’re using music to sort of counter- punctuate — trying to take you away from the emotional thread of the story and keep you on edge.”
 As an example, Miller pointed to the end of Episode 2, when one character confronts another who has betrayed her trust. “The music is comic and strange and goofy,” he said, referring to “Nightmares,” a bouncy, horn-laced cut by English alt-pop group Easy Life. “There’s nothing portentous or sad about it.”

INDIANAPOLIS -- Marco Andretti has won the pole for the Indianapolis 500 in a lightning-fast first step toward snapping the infamous "Andretti Curse" at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
   
 Andretti logged a four-lap average of 231.068 mph in Sunday qualifying, and an Andretti now will lead the field to green for the first time in 33 years. Mario Andretti won his third and final pole for the Indy 500 in 1987, when grandson Marco was an infant.
   
 As his grandson surveyed the conditions before Sunday qualifying, noting the wind had picked up from a day earlier when Marco Andretti was the fastest in the field, he remembered advice Mario Andretti has long shared with the racing family.
   
 "He said, 'The wind will scare you, but it will never crash you,'" Marco Andretti said, tears in his eyes and his hands appearing to briefly shake.
   
 The third-generation driver was greeted by his Andretti Autosport teammates, then shared a strong embrace with his father, Michael, the team owner. Mario Andretti scored the only Indy 500 win for the family in 1969; Michael Andretti fell short in 16 tries and the Aug. 23 race will be Marco Andretti's 15th attempt.
   
 "Fantastic. It was unbelievable," Michael Andretti said. "He didn't take his foot off the gas."
   
 Andretti Autosport had claimed four positions in Sunday's fast nine shootout that sets the first three rows for the Indy 500. But teammates James Hinchcliffe, Alexander Rossi and Ryan Hunter-Reay didn't have the same speed they did Saturday, and Michael Andretti feared his team would be shut out from the front row.
   
 Scott Dixon posted a four-lap average of 231.051 mph to take over the top spot and held it until Marco Andretti went out last. His first two laps were blistering and he said he really began to feel the wind on the second lap. Andretti held it open and powered through for a momentous achievement for the Andretti family.
   
 "He deserves it. I know what this place means to his family and especially him," Dixon said. "He did a good job even under this pressure to make it work. If anyone was going to do it, I hoped it was Marco."
   
 Nearly every driver in the field made their way to pit lane to congratulate Andretti, who like his father has been haunted at Indianapolis. Marco Andretti has never finished higher than third in the race. His father, who never won a pole, finished second in 1991.
   
 "An Andretti on the pole at Indianapolis -- too bad we couldn't hear the crowd explode," teammate Hunter-Reay said. The 104th Indy 500 will be the first in race history without spectators as the coronavirus pandemic forced new track owner Roger Penske to close the gates to the public.
   
 Andretti will sit on the front row alongside two former Indy 500 winners. Dixon of Chip Ganassi Racing qualified second and Takuma Sato was third for Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing.
   
 Rinus VeeKay, a 19-year-old rookie for Ed Carpenter Racing, was fourth and the only Chevrolet driver in the fast nine. Hunter-Reay and Hinchcliffe filled out the second row.
   
 Alex Palou, a rookie for Dale Coyne Racing, was seventh and will start alongside Graham Rahal and Rossi.

With an eye on the future, the main problem is Hart has barely played in recent times. His only first team game time in 2019/20 came in the domestic cups, and a record of seven goals conceded across three matches against Sunderland, Peterborough United and Norwich City doesn’t engender confidence in his current ability.


  Those games were played behind a rotated defence though, so perhaps don’t offer a fair indication of what Hart is capable of these days. That said, barring injuries to the men ahead of him in the Tottenham pecking order, he would be lining up behind similarly weakened back lines in the domestic cups and perhaps early European matches.


  It would be better to look back to 2018/19, the last time he featured in the Premier League. Hart was Burnley’s goalkeeper for the first half of the campaign, but was dropped when both his and the team’s form disintegrated. He conceded 41 goals in 19 matches, and signed off with a 5-1 home defeat to Everton.

NEW YORK (AP) — Two men have been indicted in the 2002 slaying of hip hop artist Jam Master Jay, which until now had been one of New York City's most notorious unsolved killings, three law enforcement officials told the Associated Press on Monday.The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and did so on the condition of anonymity. One of them identified the suspects as Ronald Washington and Karl Jordan. Federal prosecutors were expected to announce the charges at a news conference Monday afternoon.Washington, who had reportedly been living on a couch at Jay’s home in the days before his death, was publicly named as a possible suspect or witness as far back as 2007. He is currently serving a federal prison sentence stemming from a string of robberies he committed while on the run from police after Jay’s death.In court papers filed at the time, prosecutors alleged that Washington waved a handgun around and ordered people in Jay's Queens recording studio to lie on the ground while another man killed him on Oct. 30, 2002.Washington “provided cover for his associate to shoot and kill Jason Mizell,” prosecutors wrote.Jason “Jay” Mizell, known professionally as Jam Master Jay, was a member of 1980s hip-hop sensation Run-DMC with Joseph “Run” Simmons and Darryl “DMC” McDaniel. Their hits included “It’s Tricky,” “Christmas in Hollis” and the Aerosmith remake collaboration “Walk This Way.”Jay was shot once in the head with a .40-caliber bullet by a masked assailant at his studio in Hollis, the Queens neighborhood where he grew up, police said at the time. He left behind a wife and three children.Police identified at least four people in the studio with Jay, including the two armed gunmen. The city and Jay's friends offered more than $60,000 in reward money, but witnesses refused to come forward and the case languished.Jay's acquaintance with Washington upset his family. Before sleeping on Jay's couch, Washington had been linked to the 1995 fatal shooting of Randy Walker, a close associate of the late Tupac Shakur.___Balsamo reported from Washington, D.C.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

 MELISSA - Melissa officials announced that the city's new solid waste collection schedule will begin Oct. 5.
 As part of the changes related to a new contract with Community Waste Disposal (CWD), the city will now be divided into five geographical sections. Each will have trash and recycling pick up on a different day of the week.
 The exact boundaries of those zones have yet to be determined.
 When the final lines are drawn, city officials will distribute the information via social media, news releases and the city's website.
 The information will also be distributed to neighborhood-level organizations like homeowner associations and subdivision boards so that the word gets out.
 The last citywide trash collection day will be Sept. 30.
 On that day, current waste disposal contractor Waste Connections will enlist the help of a third-party collection service to also pick up the waste bins. All residents will be asked to place their carts on the curb that day even if they are empty.
 During the last week of September, CWD will also begin distributing its carts to residents in anticipation of the new collection schedule the following week.
 Residents who are currently paying extra for more than one garbage or recycling cart will receive a corresponding number from CWD.
 CWD will coordinate the exchange of commercial dumpsters with local businesses individually before the new contract goes into effect.
 Changes are also coming to the bulk pick-up process. Currently, residents are required to call ahead for this service.
 Come October, each of Melissa's five waste pick-up zones will also have a designated monthly bulk collection day.
 On that predetermined day, CWD will pick up garbage, recycling and bulk waste. Size and weight restrictions for bulk items will be announced at a later date.
 CWD will also collect hazardous household waste (HHW) once per month. This will include used electronics destined for recycling. Details of this program have yet to be announced.

The Rockmart Yellow Jackets are expected to be a force in Region 6-3A this season and a big part of that is due to their stacked roster.
 Credit should go to head coach Biff Parson and his staff for creating such quality depth and building the program up in their time at RHS.
 A person would be hard pressed to find a weakness in the Jackets’ game this fall. The offense should be stacked as usual, from the skill position players to the offensive line. Though they lost some help in the defensive secondary from last year’s squad, the defense overall should still be strong enough to shut down opposing offenses week in and week out.
 Unsurprisingly, senior Javin Whatley returns to lead the offense in his second year as starting quarterback. Whatley burst onto the scene in 2019, passing for 1,533 yards and completing 65 percent of his attempts. He also ran for 1,150 yards and earned First-Team All-State honors before being named the Region 7-AA Player of the Year. The 6-foot, 165-pounder currently holds offers from Akron, Army, and Chattanooga, and will be a leader on and off the field for Rockmart.
 Running back should be another focal point for the Jackets in 2020. They return sophomore JoJo Haynes, a Division I prospect who has already earned scholarship offers from Akron, Duke, and Ole Miss. They also retain the elusive Jai Penson in the backfield.
 Although the Jackets lost Mekhi Floyd to graduation and promising power back Patrick Gardner — a freshman last year who decided to transfer back to Cedartown after one year as a Jacket — Rockmart has a great stable of talented athletes who can carry the rock when their number is called upon this fall.
 By season’s end, Jakari Clark could be considered as one of the best receivers in Class 3A. Other athletes are sure to step up for the Jacket offense, as the receiving game should be open following the graduation of stars like Juke Boozer, Mekhi Floyd, and Reed Couch.
 Deacon Allen, one of the greatest offensive linemen in program history, graduated from Rockmart High School this year. The Jackets will be without his talents this fall — along with fellow graduates Matthew Waddell and Jourdan Rachel — and it will be tough to fill their shoes.
 Thankfully for Parson and company, they return experience and leadership on the line in senior Sherman Davis. The 6-1, 250-pound Davis was named to Recruit Georgia’s Preseason All-State squad and should be a difference-maker on the offensive line.
 Davis will also look to lead a new-look defensive line for the Jackets in 2020. They lost starters in Couch, Jamal Thompson, and Rachel, who each signed to play college football. Again, though, the Jackets always have a plethora of big guys ready to get after the ball carrier.
 Along with Davis, they return All-State caliber lineman Jykel Baldwin. Rockmart fans should trust in Parson to have the defensive line ready to attack come September.
 When asked, Parson said that he expects senior Kieron Roberts to be one of the biggest additions to the Rockmart defense in 2020. Roberts spent much of last season injured but is now healthy in time for his final season as a Jacket. He will be one of the big impact players in the linebacker core alongside big- hitters like senior Travis Brown, junior Daquan Banks, and freshman Bobby High.
 A Rockmart defensive secondary without Juke Boozer might look strange, but they will still have the same ball-hawking tendencies as years past. With stars like Whatley, Haynes, Clark, Keyshaun McCullough and others, the corners and safeties should be able to stifle opposing passers while also giving assists in stopping the run.
 Special teams might be a question mark for Rockmart in 2020. Kicker/punter Cooper Yanzetich transferred to Claxton High School when his father — former Rockmart baseball coach Kenny Yanzetich — accepted a new job over the summer. Kicker and punter duties will likely be left up to whoever works the hardest during camp.
 One of the biggest matchups to look out for this year will be how Rockmart’s roster as a whole matches up against a star-studded team like Rome in week one. Furthermore, it will be interesting to see how Rockmart’s defense will perform against rival Cedartown’s offense on Sept. 11.
 As far as region play goes, one of the must-see games will be Rockmart at North Murray on Oct. 16. Coach Preston Poag has built the Mountaineers into a competitive program. How the Jackets offense, led by Whatley, can perform against North Murray’s defense could determine how far Rockmart can get in 2020.
 Sonoraville at Rockmart on Oct. 2 will include two of the best quarterbacks in Class 2A — Whatley for Rockmart and Brady Lackey for Sonoraville. If the Jackets’ secondary can shut down Lackey, they should be in for a great season.
 Finally, Rockmart will meet Adairsville’s stingy defense on the road Nov. 6. The Tigers should have one of the best defenses the Jackets will face all season. Rockmart’s run-heavy offense will have to get the ball rolling early and often if they expect to defeat the Tigers in Bartow County.

Alexander Klaskovsky, an independent Minsk-based political analyst, said the conversations with Putin may reflect the Kremlin mulling support for Lukashenko in exchange for his consent for a closer union between the two nations, which the Belarusian leader has resisted in the past.
 "Russia understands Lukashenko's weakness and is preparing its own scenario, which could envisage a deep integration in exchange for military assistance," Klaskovsky said.
 The official results of the election gave Lukashenko 80% of the votes and Tsikhanouskaya only 10%, but the opposition claimed the outcome was falsified. Tsikhanouskaya has cited reports from precincts around the country showed her winning 60%-70% of the vote.
 The 37-year-old former teacher left for neighboring Lithuania on Aug. 11 under what her associates described as pressure from law enforcement officials. Her husband, an opposition blogger, has been jailed since May, and she had replaced on the ballot.
 In a video statement on Monday, Tsikhanouskaya said she was prepared to step in.
 "I'm ready to take on the responsibility and act as a national leader in order for the country to calm down, return to its normal rhythm, in order for us to free all the political prisoners and prepare legislation and conditions for organizing new presidential elections," she said.
 After the police crackdown and reports of abuse provoked widespread anger, the authorities backed off, allowing big weekend protests and releasing many of the detainees. The Interior Ministry said that just 122 detainees were still in custody as of Monday.
 Huge crowds turned out Saturday to pay their respects to Alexander Taraikovsky, a protester who died Aug. 10. The authorities initially claimed he died when an explosive device he intended to throw at police blew up in his hands, but Associated Press video showed that he had no explosive when he fell on the ground, his shirt bloodied. His partner said his body had a perforation in his chest that she believes was a bullet wound.
 Interior Minister stepped back from the official version Sunday, acknowledging that Taraikovsky might have been killed by a rubber bullet. His partner, Elena German, told The Associated Press Monday that she will push for an independent investigation into what she described as his killing at point-blank range.
 On Sunday, an estimated 200,000 people filled the central Independence Square and nearby avenues in the largest protest the country has ever seen.
 In Brussels, European Council President Charles Michel convened an emergency summit of EU leaders on Wednesday to discuss the handling of the election and the crackdown.
 "The people of Belarus have the right to decide on their future and freely elect their leader," Michel said in a tweet. "Violence against protesters is unacceptable and cannot be allowed."
 On Friday, the 27 EU foreign ministers underlined that the elections were neither free nor fair and decided to start drawing up a list of people who could face sanctions from the violence.
 German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged Lukashenko Monday to "follow the path of talks, not to rely on violence but on dialogue."
 "I appeal to the Belarusian military not to sin by using violence against their own people," he said.

LAKE GEORGE — A boat parade on Lake George in support of President Donald Trump attracted more than 100 boats and prompted complaints from lakefront property owners about damage to their boats and docks.
 Janet Lynch posted to the Lake George NY Boaters group on Facebook that she was staying on a camp on Long Island when the parade went by at high speed and caused waves of 5 and 6 feet high.
 “My son and friend were sleeping on the boat. My husband and camping neighbors rushed to the dock to try to stop the boat from slamming on the rocks,” she wrote. “We were holding on for dear life when the sheer force of the wave caused the dock to break away, sweeping my husband and neighbors into the water under the boat.

Karl Urban is delightful as Billy Butcher, the charismatic but cutthroat leader of _The Boys_ , and we'll get to see him in action once more in season 2 of Amazon's hit series. That said, Butcher is not the only fan-favorite Urban has brought to life, as there are many who adored his version of Judge Dredd in 2012's _Dredd_. There hasn't been an announcement of a sequel just yet, but when ComicBook.com spoke to Urban about the possibility of one day playing Butcher and Dredd at the same time, he was thrilled with the idea.


  "Yeah, I certainly hope so, that would be, that'd be rad, wouldn't it? I would ideally love to get into those boots again you know, so we'll have to wait and see," Urban said.


  Despite being beloved by fans, the film didn't generate numbers at the box office, but Urban has said in the past that one of the biggest issues with the film was the marketing behind it.


  "Dredd represented a failure in marketing. I saw the tracking of that film weeks before it came out and the fundamental problem was no one knew it was being released," Urban told Yahoo! News. "Once it came out on DVD and it sold 750,000 copies in the first week alone in North America alone, it was very clear that the audience had discovered it."


  The Boys is executive produced by Seth Rogen and Eric Kripke, and stars Karl Urban and Jack Quaid in the lead roles of "The Boys" leader Billy Butcher and new recruit Hughie Campbell. Also in the ensemble cast are Jennifer Esposito (The Affair), Karen Fukuhara (Suicide Squad) Antony Starr (Banshee), Dominique McElligott (Hell On Wheels), Jessie T. Usher (Independence Day: Resurgence), Chace Crawford (Gossip Girl), Laz Alonso (Fast & Furious), Tomer Capon, Nathan Mitchell, and Erin Moriarty (Jessica Jones).


  You can find the official description for _The Boys_ season 2 below.


  "In a more intense, more desperate Season 2 of THE BOYS, Butcher, Hughie and the team reel from their losses in Season 1. On the run from the law, they struggle to fight back against the Superheroes. As Vought, the company that manages the heroes, cashes in on the panic over the threat of Supervillains, and a new hero, Stormfront, shakes up the company and challenges an already unstable Homelander."

Just 78 days from the general election and today kicks off one of the largest events an election year the Democratic National Convention. We are tracking it all right here at ABC news live this week is building speeches by some of the party's biggest stars. And able and with Joseph Biden and come on Harris accepting their nominations as the democratic presidential and vice presidential candidates. A new ABC news Washington Post poll has Joseph Biden leading president I'm 53 to 41%. Among registered voters. The candidates gave us of a preview of what's to come at their first official event together as running. I knew we're in the battles. And sold the nation. Customers decided to run. I'm proud now to have. Senator Harris. And my side in that battle she shares of the same intensity. She's someone who knows what's his. Night and the people are glued Jill and I will fight for every day in the White House. And let me tell you as somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments being four. The case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence. Is open and shut us. For more on what tricks. Activity and see this week I'm joined by ABC news political director Rick Klein in Washington for economic pulling any punches that's pressure but both. The democratic and Republican conventions are mirth and virtual this year because of the pandemic. What kind of a rolled of these conventions traditionally play and how might that change this year. Modern conventions essentially our TV shows anyway so there's a certain intellectual Odyssey is saying. The that this is all going to be virtual this is all going to be geared toward that. TV audience it's gonna be weird though I tomorrow might weirder than even watching sports in the age of Covert nineteen not to have any reaction. Any the sights and sounds the funny hats the balloons the streamers the the pyrotechnics that can happen. All of that is out because we're in this new virtual world so. It's really gonna be on the speakers that to keep to these tighter time frames deliver those messages as as quickly as they can. And as compelling a fashion as they can but but frankly no one really knows what to expect this is never happened before. No more ban is now bad dance knows whatever holy dip. Exactly good and that's the fun of a convention instead it's gonna have to rely on on a whole lot of speeches and they'll be plenty of them even though they'll be quite a bit tighter than they've been in years past also on that note we got four nights of the DNC they all have different themes with different speakers to fit those themes. Tonight is all about we the people what are some of the highlights. This night is intended to show the potential breath of the Biden coalition going from ideological left or right you have senator Bernie Sanders. I and you have a former governor John Kasich a Republican who ran for president just four years ago. So that I think is one indication you also got awesome red state Democrats up people like senator Doug Jones from Alabama. And the ended the night is going to be Michelle Obama the First Lady as we know is one of the most popular figures if not be most popular political figure in the country she's taped her speech. A bananas going to be the last thing that that that's out delegates virtually in and the audience on this the C tonight. Find a former president Brack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama have most stayed on the sidelines during his campaign. But they will both be speaking during this convention given things are virtual how much more important eyes things like you know star power and having big names behind you. The Democrats need motivation they need that it more than unity at this moment which is unusual because usually you come into dimension to talk about all the divisions. Fights over party platform and or they're going to be boos when certain speakers get opera cheers for certain lines all of that is gone so instead this really is about. I getting the democratic base and any independents and maybe even Republicans motivated to vote. That's where the obamas come in particularly Michelle Obama spoke the law folks a lot of are experts on. A voter registration voter engagement are getting out there and finding a rationale for people at home to connect and I think the choice of Kabul Harris according to or polling. I and other indications have only been positive so far for the early rollout. Rick we can't let you go without playing a little bit of our favorite game stuff. Lions only appropriate that we do one that is beamed around the conventions are you ready Rick. I think your favorite gay not as it would not go. Fair enough but it's my shows off we go out brits who is the first candidate nominated at a Democratic National Convention and where was it held. The first I but it I had to go to Baltimore does that have so many but I I don't think I can tell you the first. Convention nomination that I don't have all right well we'll give it here as it entered Jackson in some more Baltimore Baltimore they'd had a lot it's. Its interest in Chicago's have the most Baltimore's the second most. I'll pour Milwaukee they've never had one before this year and I guess they're gonna have to wait for any kind of a real convention of the city but Andrew Jackson in Baltimore sounds like a good answer and I just showing off earlier action knowledge of the here. Rick who is the first nominee to speak in person at a convention. Who that's a good one ominous go. I'm gonna go with Roosevelt Franklin Roosevelt you are Karl. Joseph Biden is 77 years old who was the oldest nominee for president or vice president for either party. I'm and a goal with John McCain for that this is a tough one Henry David. With the Democrats nominated for vice president at age 81 the olden nominee ever for either party for top office. It's okay contested conventions used to be a lot more comments so which yeah Benton had the longest nominating process before picking a nominee. The date they were they sometimes wins the teens about I can't tell you when the longest was there hasn't been one and a second ballot though. C eighty partial credit for this little piece of knowledge since 1952. So it's been awhile since we've Havoc investigate mentioned what's the answer for the the most number of ballots. Answers 1924. After 103. Tries over the course of seven. John Davis was selected as the democratic number you imagine covering that one I still here still voting. And we're finally Rick which city has hosted the most conventions you might have already said this foe Chicago Yasser moved to Chicago it's that it midwest to bring a central location so. Easy to get to by train although it's weird they haven't had one I think since 1986 now so a bit of a drought for the windy city act but it's no walk is turn right that's your thing. That well Milwaukee that this is their big opportunity it would have been fun and their people walk eerie talking like give us 20/20 four but there they wanna be back in four years. I replied always great thanks her. Rushing us up on the. Playing with us our alphabet. And from here I'll be sure to tune in tonight at 7 PM eastern for ABC news live special coverage of the kick off to the twenties when he Democratic National Convention. George David and Lindsey Davis we'll all bring you the latest. And that's tonight 7 PM eastern right here on ABC news.

MELISSA - Melissa officials announced that the city's new solid waste collection schedule will begin Oct. 5.
   
 As part of the changes related to a new contract with Community Waste Disposal (CWD), the city will now be divided into five geographical sections. Each will have trash and recycling pick up on a different day of the week.
   
 The exact boundaries of those zones have yet to be determined.
   
 When the final lines are drawn, city officials will distribute the information via social media, news releases and the city's website.
   
 The information will also be distributed to neighborhood-level organizations like homeowner associations and subdivision boards so that the word gets out.
   
 The last citywide trash collection day will be Sept. 30.
   
 On that day, current waste disposal contractor Waste Connections will enlist the help of a third-party collection service to also pick up the waste bins. All residents will be asked to place their carts on the curb that day even if they are empty.
   
 During the last week of September, CWD will also begin distributing its carts to residents in anticipation of the new collection schedule the following week.
   
 Residents who are currently paying extra for more than one garbage or recycling cart will receive a corresponding number from CWD.
   
 CWD will coordinate the exchange of commercial dumpsters with local businesses individually before the new contract goes into effect.
   
 Changes are also coming to the bulk pick-up process. Currently, residents are required to call ahead for this service.
   
 Come October, each of Melissa's five waste pick-up zones will also have a designated monthly bulk collection day.
   
 On that predetermined day, CWD will pick up garbage, recycling and bulk waste. Size and weight restrictions for bulk items will be announced at a later date.
   
 CWD will also collect hazardous household waste (HHW) once per month. This will include used electronics destined for recycling. Details of this program have yet to be announced.

On the second question, why do we believe that we won't see irrational spending. We don't really concern ourselves too much with whether you do or don't because we don't respond to irrational spending. One of the nice things about the sports media market is there are lots of places you can go to find customers. And we don't base our decisions on how much we are going to spend on what our competitors are doing. We base them on the return on ad spend that we are seeing. At least now, and potentially this is due to stay-at-home probably it is. So hard to say kind of how it plays out in the long term, but right now, we're actually seeing falling tax. And we're actually able to spend more and continue to invest deeper in marketing than we had thought with lower tax. So at least for now, that is the trend.

The nuclear weapons dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki 75 years ago this month wreaked a devastation never before seen in human warfare. Yet they were firecrackers compared with the nuclear weapons that were soon developed -- bombs, warheads, shells, torpedoes and other devices capable of vaporizing the human race in an apocalyptic flash.
   
 For decades, that thought cast a pall of acute anxiety over America and the world. Whether because of that fear, a strategy of effective deterrence, chance or all the above, the United States remains the only country to have used nuclear weapons in combat. With the end of the Cold War, anxiety around nuclear war has receded. Most people probably are not aware that a harrowing and expensive new arms race is now underway.
   
 Today Americans are more likely to identify climate change as the greatest man-made threat to the planet. Last year, in the list of what Americans fear compiled annually by Chapman University, "North Korea using nuclear weapons" and "Nuclear weapons attack" ranked 27 and 29, far below "Corrupt government officials" (No. 1) or "Pollution of oceans, rivers and lakes" (No. 2).
   
 Yet even with the Cold War long over and stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the Russian and American arsenals sharply reduced through a series of nuclear arms treaties, to fewer than 6,000 warheads each, there are no grounds for complacency. The world can still be destroyed in a flash.
   
 Nine states have nuclear weapons -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. Iran's nuclear program has been the focus of intense concern for years, and Saudi Arabia has vowed that if Iran develops a nuclear weapon, it will follow suit. Consider also that two men have the power to unleash a nuclear barrage entirely on their own -- President Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, who are both working assiduously on modernizing their arsenals.
   
 Mr. Trump has said he is working on a new arms control agreement with Russia and is seeking to include China in the talks. But his administration has always found it easier to tear up treaties than to sign them, especially if the result in any way restrains the United States. As the special envoy for arms control, Marshall Billingslea, boasted in May, "We know how to win these races, and we know how to spend the adversary into oblivion."
   
 Before the coronavirus pandemic put millions of Americans out of work, spending so much money on new doomsday weapons was profligate. Now, it seems morally indefensible. This week, the Government Accountability Office said that, without changes, the Pentagon's nuclear weapons modernization effort is on track to surpass its $1.2 trillion price tag over the next three decades. It seems as though the United States is plunging into a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China without having learned the lessons of the last one.
   
 When briefed by the military in 2017 on the levels to which American and Russian nuclear arsenals had been reduced through arms treaties, Mr. Trump reportedly demanded that the United States increase its nuclear stockpile tenfold. According to some reports, this was what prompted the secretary of state at the time, Rex Tillerson, to call the president a "moron."
   
 Mr. Trump withdrew the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Iran nuclear deal, and he has not yet extended the New START accord, the only agreement still in place limiting American and Russian nuclear forces, which was signed by President Barack Obama and expires in early February. In addition, the Trump administration was recently reported to be thinking of breaking the 28-year-old moratorium on nuclear testing.
   
 The 75th anniversary of Hiroshima is a good time to revive serious public concern about nuclear weapons. The pandemic may leave little room for other fears, but public health and economic recovery should not have to compete for resources with a needless and enormously expensive new arms race.
   
 Above all, the wrenching images of scorched rubble where Hiroshima had stood ought to be cause for serious reflection on what nuclear weapons do -- and what they cannot do.

 Wick said there was no state Department of Environmental Conservation regatta permit issued for this event.
 It is a murky issue, Wick added, because these events form through word of mouth on special media and there is no one single entity responsible for organizing it. It is different than, for example, a sailing regatta organized by a boat and yacht club.

While a team’s defensive issues cannot be laid solely at the door of the goalkeeper, the statistics suggest Hart did little to help with them either.


  His save percentage was 65.8, the sixth worst in the division that season ( _according to FBRef.com_ ). And that was actually an improvement on his record in his 19 league games with West Ham United in 2017/18, across which he only saved 60.2% of opposition shots which were on target.


  Bear in mind that Lloris was the third best goalkeeper in the Premier League by this measure in 2017/18, saving 72.5% of the shots he faced. He improved the following season too, with his figure of 75.4% ranking him as the second best in the division.


  Save percentage is a simplistic statistic to assess goalkeepers with these days though. Using expected goal models, it’s possible to get an idea about the number of goals an average ‘keeper would have conceded based on the quality of chances they faced, and where within the goal frame the shot was heading.

The conundrum in having a Plan B suggests that you can move back to the point where you chose between Plans A or B. That’s ridiculous.

People, situations, information, the world, have all changed. Act accordingly.
