For the Iran hawks in the Trump administration, those failures were all to the good, as they would eventually frustrate the president until he felt he had no choice but to launch a full-scale war on Iran. For these officials, the escalatory measure of killing Soleimani was intended to backfire and snowball into direct conflict. Even that dangerous ambition does not appear to be in the offing, however, as Iran’s response, a barrage of ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases hosting U.S. forces resulting in no casualties, appears to have successfully shown force against the enemy and avoided providing Trump with a casus belli.

It shouldn't be the case that a second striker would get no game time at Tottenham. Beyond the fact that Kane should be taken off every once in a while (and not forgetting that he gets injured fairly often), Spurs played a huge proportion of last season with two up front. They started 20 of their 38 Premier League games in a formation that required two strikers. Another forward in their squad would get plenty of opportunities, and in doing so, would actually help Kane play even more.

She added that the locations where items have been purchased have been all over the map, but did not provide a specific breakdown.
 “Some individuals have gotten it online, but some have gotten it at even reputable, permitted shops,” Wooten said. “There is no one location where the products have been purchased.”
 Fletcher said he feels that the moratoriums he and his colleague have proposed are a sensible way of dealing with a range of unknowns. Most specifically, there have been no large studies of vaping’s long-term effects on the lungs.
 “There is no FDA approval or certification, there is no CDC, there is not entity testing the safety of these products anywhere,” Fletcher said. “Whether you buy it from a shop that has a wonderfully nice person in a wonderfully nice store or whether you order it online, it’s the same product, because there is no entity out there testing these things for public health.”
 But Conley, the vaping association president, took exception to that statement because it conflates legitimate manufacturers with those operating under brand names such as “Dank Vapes” which are not regulated and which have been most directly implicated in CDC investigations so far.
 “All legally operating nicotine vaping products and their ingredients are registered with the Food & Drug Administration and the manufacturing facilities where these products are made are regularly subject to unannounced inspections from the FDA,” Conley said.
 “If this moves through, the same illicit market dealers selling untaxed and unregulated THC cartridges to the public will also be selling completely unregulated nicotine vaping products. What is Supervisor Fletcher’s plan for that? Another drug war or just allowing the illicit market to go unchecked so long as he doesn’t have to see vape storefronts when he drives to work?”
 The ordinances, which also propose a moratorium on vaping in outdoor spaces such as patios, go before the board Tuesday for a first reading but would have to be brought back for a second vote on Jan. 28. The board would also need to hold a separate pair of votes for a proposed registration program. If approved, the ordinances would take effect on July 1.

AUSTIN, Texas -- Retired state employees Vickey Benford, 63, and Joan Caldwell, 61, are Golden Rollers, a group of the over-50 set that gets out on assorted bikes -- including trikes for adults they call "three wheels of awesome" -- for an hour of trail riding and camaraderie.      "I love to exercise, and I like to stay fit," said Caldwell, who tried out a recumbent bike, a low-impact option that can be easier on the back. "It keeps me young."      Benford encouraged Caldwell to join the organized rides, which have attracted more than 225 riders at city rec centers and senior activity centers. The cyclists can choose from a small, donated fleet of recumbent bikes, tandem recumbents and tricycles.      "With seniors, it's less about transportation and more about access to the outdoors, social engagement and quality of life," said Christopher Stanton, whose idea for Golden Rollers grew out of the Ghisallo Cycling Initiative, a youth biking nonprofit he founded in 2011.      But that's not all, according to brain scientists. They point to another important benefit: Exercising both body and brain can help people stay healthier longer.      The new thinking about aging considers not just how long one lives, but how vibrant one stays later in life.      "If you're living, you want to be living well," said Tim Peterson, an assistant professor of internal medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. "Most people who were interested in life span and were studying genes -- which control life span -- switched to 'healthspan.'"      "Healthspan," a coinage now gaining traction, refers to the years that a person can expect to live in generally good health -- free of chronic illnesses and cognitive decline that can emerge near life's end. Although there's only so much a person can do to delay the onset of disease, there's plenty that scientists are learning to improve your chances of a better healthspan.      The work takes on special resonance in light of a new report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that life expectancy in the United States has decreased in recent years. A rise in midlife mortality (ages 25 to 64) has dragged down the overall expectancy.      "The idea is to make people productive, healthier and happier longer and more capable taking care of themselves," said Andreana Haley, a psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin who is among this breed of researchers working to understand healthspan. "We now live a long time with a lot of chronic diseases, and it's not fun. It's costly -- in terms of productivity, caregiving responsibilities, cost of health care."      Haley, who collaborates with exercise physiologists, nutritionists, behavioral neuroscientists and physicians, said researchers from many other disciplines are also studying healthspan, such as nurses, speech pathologists and pharmacists.      Their work is inspired by an aging U.S. population with changing needs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 10,000 people a day turn 65, the nation's fastest-growing population segment.      "We have a lot of people who will need to be taken care of in the next 50 years," she said, "and fewer young people to do the care."      Haley, with UT's Aging and Longevity Center, focuses her work on midlife, which she defines as ages 40 to 60, a time when health choices can have a big impact on older years. She's especially interested in brain health.      Her team is collaborating with UT's Human Laser Lab to pilot the use of low- level light therapy to increase brain energy and improve cognitive performance.      Because of this close brain-body connection, any degeneration in the brain affects not only cognitive function but also areas that control weight, appetite, personality, mood and blood pressure.      Online games and brain-training exercises have become popular as another way to keep the brain sharp.      However, research on brain training reflects mixed results, including a study published last year in the journal Neuropsychologia, which "calls into question the benefit of cognitive training beyond practice effects."      Still, aging experts urge people as they age to work to keep mentally active, as well as physically active, to lengthen their healthspan.

The rumours of reducing the age of candidates from 40 years to 32 years has been cleared by Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission. UPSC Secretary Jagdish vividly stated that in the near future, there has been no proposal to reduce the age limit of the applicants appearing in Provincial Civil Services Examination. It was necessary to issue the clarification about the rumours as many candidates believed the media buzz about the age reduction stood in protests outside the commission. The candidates were made to believe that the age reduction decision has been made by the Union Public Service Commission. The State Public Service Commission changed the examination pattern last year in line with the Union Public Service Commission. As per the examination pattern, the preliminary exams consist of the multiple-choice questions and those who clear the preliminary exams will appear for the mains examination. The main examination is of pen and paper method and consists of subjective questions to examine the candidates on the basis of two main subjects of their choice. According to the UPSC exam pattern, the question paper has been divided into 4 major papers with various subjects and are clubbed together in Paper 1, Paper 2, Paper 3, and Paper 4. Candidates would need to choose only one subject as their main subject. This exam pattern was adopted by UPPSC this year, and the recent examination was conducted in this pattern. And post the changes in the examination pattern, candidates believed the news of age reduction that went viral on social media for all the obvious reasons.

Other traditional heartlands, from Belfast to Waterford and Limerick and Tralee, will be represented but none in greater volume than Portlaoise — yes, Portlaoise — whose Panthers uniform will adorn four of the contests. The midlands side’s singlet will feature in the Women’s Division One, U20 and U18 cups, as well as the men’s U20s.
 It’s an extraordinary achievement and all the more so as it comes on the back of a similar push this time 12 months ago. No other club — not from the Dublin or Cork strongholds or anywhere else on this island — will bring more than two sides to this elevated stage of the season than the Panthers who are only a dozen years young but based in a town long wedded to the game.
 The mid-60s brought something of a sporting revolution to Portlaoise. The first soccer and rugby clubs were founded in 1966 but, while basketball stole a march on them a year before, it was 2007 before the loose strands of a boys club, separate adult teams, and a new girls section were amalgamated into the Panthers.
 The operation that exists now caters for players from kindergarten right up to Masters levels, more than 400 people and rising, with in and around 30 teams on the go. Honours have been claimed across all grades, including at national level where the women’s team has won the National Cup twice and spent time in the Super League.

 Bring the Larkham change-up in style, of course, but bring the belligerence. On Sunday the pack needs to be wired a la the dogs of yesterday. I hope they are.
 These are the occasions when Irish emotion, channelled in the right way, can be a very powerful tool. What the Munster supporters will ask for is that the players leave it all out there, and that it is important for Munster players to do that. It mightn’t even guarantee a win, but it should guarantee a performance and Munster fans, because of how much they love that team and how much they understand rugby, can sleep alright on Sunday night, even in defeat.
 As long as they empty the tank. What we can’t have is wishy washy decision- making, average box-kicking, falling off tackles. Not fronting up as a pack. Believe me, the supporters certainly didn’t go to bed last Friday night feeling that the boys left it all out there.
 There are some legacy issues Munster are still paying the price for. The reality, in my view, is that some people who don’t know the club and the ethos put average players in positions of prominence and power. Lads who get called ‘leaders’. Let’s call a spade a spade. If that’s your leadership group, what message does that send to everyone else?
 Maybe it’s a societal thing because around the place now, there’s an acceptance of spoofers in every walk of life. In rugby, they are called statistics manipulators, lads who play their rugby to hit a set amount of rucks and get their set number of tackles. And all the while offering little material edge to their team-mates.
 Racing 92, in Champions Cup terms, are a superpower. Let’s remember that. In trying to make the case for an away victory, one has to recognise that Racing have a lot of proper good players. And Munster are missing some of theirs. People should understand the value of what a good ten brings to a team — hence Carbery and Bleyendaal are losses for Munster. On this surface, Joey would be electric. But not this Sunday. Other Munster leaders must stand up and be counted. And then we can all sleep soundly Sunday night.

With the Union Budget on the horizon, the wishlists from various sectors vary but also remain the same in terms of growth expectations, liquidity, credit, and ease of doing business.
 The real estate and infrastructure sector are also focused on easing liquidity and easing business structures. There are, however, some concerns that the industry is faced with. The NBFC crisis has impacted real estate in the country, and there’s enough justification to warrant the improvement of credit off-take. Aside from recapitalisation by the government and stringent measures by the RBI, the gross NPAs of banks also improved to just about 9.1% towards September-end 2019 (against 11.2% the preceding year).
 The need for the hour is governance changes in terms of the creation of a well-functioning bonds market, partial credit guarantee scheme, alternative investment funds in the real estate sector, and measures for alleviating stress among NBFCs.
 Another concern would be the cancellation of ITC benefits. While the GST rate on under-construction properties was reduced to 5% in 2019, the previously available ITC benefit was shelved. Already cash-starved developers cannot get tax benefits and therefore the increased costs are passed on to the buyers. Providing benefits may be a great incentive to reduce property prices and make under-construction homes more attractive.
 A corrective measure for boosting demand in the sector would be the immediate deployment of ₹25,000 crore alternative funds for completion of stressed projects. This would improve buyer sentiment and boost demand.
 The most important change that needs to be brought about is making affordable housing projects a reality. Easing liquidity is one such initiative that will increase capital flow for developers and keep a supply, thus gaining the confidence of the home buyer. We also need proactive initiatives for investments in affordable housing since developers are currently unable to get funding from major banks and NBFCs at lower interest rates, leading to dismal profit margins.
 Another initiative that might kick-start a healthier demand for housing would be the hiking of tax rebates on housing loans, especially within affordable and mid-segment categories.
 The new lower 15% tax fee for businesses trying to set up new factories may be useful if they are able to procure land easily. Implementation of a unique identification number (UID) for land will bring transparency to India’s old land records system and help entice more overseas investors. This will hopefully speed up the approval system for actual estate projects as well.
 ## Execution must be good
 All these initiatives would only be fruitful with effective execution. The government’s plan to spend ₹105 lakh crore on infrastructure over the next five years can only give economic results with speedier on-ground implementation. There is a dire need to iron out the bottlenecks hampering infrastructure growth – this is needed in the short term (1-3 years) rather than the long term.
 For the common man, personal tax relief should be implemented either by a cut in tax rates or favourably readjusted tax slabs since the last increase in the deduction limit under Section 80C (to ₹1.5 lakh a year) was in 2014 and a revision is long overdue. More incentives and schemes need to be implemented for home principal and interest exemptions to encourage first-time buyers. Long-Term Capital Gains tax should be abolished to bring back investors to the stock market.
 The economy grappled with global issues including the U.S.-China trade war and internal issues like bank NPAs and liquidity crisis in 2019.
 While the government took steps including reduction in corporate tax rates and standardisation of GST, the current fiscal deficit and the muted GDP growth rate puts it in a tight corner in terms of living up to the budget expectations of the industry and the common man. The very recent U.S.-Iran tussle may further complicate the issue.
 Only time will tell how it will walk the tightrope and achieve GDP growth, and improve liquidity and employment and consumer spending in the years to come.

The new jet was intended to be similar enough to require only the tablet-based training to bring pilots up to speed on the differences between the old model and the new one. One email included in Thursday's collection of documents from Boeing's chief technical pilot made it clear how crucial it was to the company that the simulator not be required.
