Moving to the next slide, we can see what you have been informed already; the actions that the Board took right after Brumadinho installing 3 independent committees: The first one, not in order because the first of 2 ones were the Extraordinary Independent Consulting Committee for Investigation; and the Committee for Support and Reparations. These 2 committees were announced already 2 days after Brumadinho and one week later they were up and running.

Congress‚Äôs struggle to so much as enact paid sick leave for all workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic may make broader actions seem impossible. But the chief Republican complaint about Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs initial paid-sick- leave proposal appears to be reasonable and resolvable: House Democrats wanted to establish paid leave as a mandatory benefit that employers must provide their workers, an approach that would increase firms‚Äô expenses just as their cash flow is cratering. Such a policy would conceivably accelerate layoffs by making it even harder for businesses to stay afloat without slashing payroll. As Republican senator Lamar Alexander has argued, the federal government should pick up the full tab on sick leave. Corporate America may be due for a tax hike at some future date. But now isn‚Äôt the time to put the squeeze to these businesses. The economy needs demand and Uncle Sam can currently borrow at zero percent interest rates. Congress must not let its superstitious fear of deficits push it into a penny-pinching fiscal policy that proves orders of magnitude more expensive than giant appropriations in the long run (as Congress did in the aftermath of the 2008 crash).

TAMPA, FLORIDA, UNITED STATES, March 17, 2020 /EINPresswire.com/ -- With a leg up for the little guy, PharmVantage launches a direct to employer program that allows pharmacies to bolster their bottom lines. The new company works in tandem with independent pharmacies to remove Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) systems. Employing a way around the red tape, PharmVantage directly contracts with employer groups such as health systems and hospitals. On point to keep small pharmacies in business, the turnkey solution acts as a backend solution that makes what has been widely noted as ‚ÄúPBM Spread‚Äù as ineffectual as it is unnecessary.

This is the tricky one. On the one hand, wide swathes of corporate America have been lapping up federal largesse for years (and/or decades) now. And some of the industries that are going to be hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis are agents of social disaster ‚Äî from the for-profit hospital sector whose rentierism has helped to keep America‚Äôs health-care system exceptionally expensive and inhumane, to the fossil-fuel industry whose lobbying has undermined the transition to sustainable energy. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 recession is likely to accelerate the extinction of firms that were already in long-term decline. Even if some of these companies are sympathetic, does it make sense for taxpayers to foot the bill for postponing their inevitable demise?

This one should go without saying. Already, one in five U.S. workers have lost jobs or hours as a result of the pandemic. And American laborers are even more vulnerable to this economic shock than their counterparts in other developed countries, due to our nation‚Äôs exceptionally threadbare safety net. Most European countries have long provided their workers with forms of social insurance like universal health care, months‚Äô worth of paid leave, public child care, child allowances, and unemployment insurance far more generous and long-lasting than that which exists in the United States. All of these have served to cushion the blow for workers on the Continent, while helping to sustain the broader economy by propping up demand. Nevertheless, even in the European nations with the most comprehensive welfare states, such as Denmark, policy-makers have recognized that massive new appropriations must be made to keep workers afloat in this time of crisis. This week, the Danish government offered to pay 75 percent of the wage bill of any firm impacted by coronavirus for three months, if those companies agree to pay the remaining 25 percent while laying off no one.

Cataloguing precisely which industries merit outsize help, and on what terms, would require more time and expertise than I can muster here. But, as _The Atlantic_‚Äôs Derek Thompson and Bloomberg‚Äôs Joe Weisenthal have argued, the restaurant industry seems to be an especially worthy candidate for federal help. Beyond the fact that the state has formally ordered restaurants to close their doors in many states, food service has become a pillar of working-class employment in the U.S., supplying more than 10 percent of all jobs in some states. Restaurants are also typically low-margin businesses that can‚Äôt afford to overpay management or buy back their own shares or engage in most other forms of corporate self-dealing. And as institutions that increase the appeal of the areas in which they operate, restaurants function as a quasi‚Äìpublic good, offering some marginal benefit even to those who do not frequent them.

DENVER (AP) ‚Äî A Colorado man and his insurance company paid $500,000 to the U.S. government over a wildfire that burned federal land in the state. Dale Owns and Grange Insurance Association made the payment to resolve liability for the 2017 blaze that became known as the Dead Dog Fire, The Denver Post reported Monday. Owens started a campfire to roast hot dogs for his family in June 2017 and the fire spread while he stepped away to gather more wood, a statement by the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office for the District of Colorado said. The Craig resident called 911 and tried to put out the fire but was unsuccessful. The wildfire burned more than 27 square miles (70 square kilometers) of federal land north of Rangely. The Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service incurred significant costs fighting the fire, the U.S. attorney's office said. ‚ÄúWildfires are a constant danger in Colorado, and taxpayers often foot the bill for putting them out.

In regard to Gregory J. Gilligan‚Äôs recent front-page story "Virus concerns bring toilet paper shortages," I agree that stockpiling is absolutely crazy. I understand the need for milk and bread. It‚Äôs a contagious genetic trait that all Richmonders have or receive on moving to the area. But why all the fuss over a shortage of toilet paper? Having been the proud owner of a bidet for years, I find it amusing to watch people fight over this. I‚Äôve never had a roll of toilet paper provide me with a night light, a heated seat, a warm water wash or a stream of air to dry my bum. All this and a remote control to boot. No need for retrofitting with many models coming as a replacement seat. So save a tree. Go clean. Buy a bidet.
