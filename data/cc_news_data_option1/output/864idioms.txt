But now is better than never. I am glad Congress finally found the courage and heart to do the right thing.
 Now people who engage in what historically was an act of vigilante justice by whites who wanted to keep African Americans in their place can be charged and convicted for a federal hate crime. Punishment is up to life in prison, a fine or both.
 For decades, an unfair justice system meant that people were never charged in lynching, found innocent by compassionate all-white juries or received light sentences. The brutal punishment was often for unproven crimes, such as looking at a white woman or disrespecting a white person.
 And while it’s true that lynching is not common in current times, the legislation sends a strong message that as a country we won’t tolerate brutal acts of racism.
 “It shows that we, as a nation, know the difference between right and wrong, even if it took us a while to get there,” said Will Schwarz, president of the Maryland Lynching Memorial Project, Inc. “It at last criminalizes the most virulent weapon of white supremacy. It’s a long overdue admission that black Americans have been the targets of a terror campaign for hundreds of years.”
 Some would say it is better to leave this history in the past. That white Americans today shouldn’t be responsible for the past transgressions of their ancestors. That it makes them uncomfortable to think about and will rile up tensions between the races.

And had it not been for a last-gasp equalizer by the Nashville Predators, Calgary could have come away from their longest and most difficult spell away from home in 2019-20 with even more as the club continues to battle for a Western Conference playoff berth.
 "When we put our game on the ice the way we can play it, we can play with anybody," Flames interim head coach Geoff Ward said following the victory in Sunrise, Fla. "We saw that over the course of the road trip."
 Calgary opened with a 4-2 victory over the lowly Detroit Red Wings before picking up an impressive 5-2 decision in Boston against the NHL-leading Bruins. The Flames lost 4-3 in overtime at Nashville after that buzzer-beater to force extra time and were outplayed in a 4-3 setback to the Tampa Bay Lightning — the team with the third-best record in the league — on Saturday before regrouping with that solid effort against the Panthers.
 "Really good road trip," Flames captain Mark Giordano said. "If we would have looked at this one at the start of the year and said we'll go 3-1-1 with the quality of opponents, we would have taken that."
 Now the focus shifts to getting similar results at home.
 Calgary owns the NHL's fourth-best road record at 20-14-3 and was tied for the seventh-best points percentage (.581) with Nashville heading into Monday's action.
 But home cooking has provided a stark contrast, where the Flames have the league's 29th-best record at 14-12-4 and are tied for 23rd in points percentage (.533).
 Calgary averages 2.76 goals scored on the road compared to 3.10 at home. The biggest difference, however, is goals allowed — 2.78 to 3.40.
 "We just have to bring our road game home," said Flames netminder Cam Talbot, who made 38 saves in Sunday's shutout. "Keep it simple. Get pucks in, get pucks out, put pucks on net and jam away."
 Teams often say similar things after successful road trips. Actually doing it is the challenge.
 Players' lives are more hectic at home with family and other responsibilities. The road is simple — hotel, rink, plane, repeat.
 "We can't really overthink it," said Lucic, Calgary's bruising winger who picked up his seventh goal of the season against Florida. "Home or away our game needs to remain the same ... it can be tough."

Donna Estes, program director and instructor of Health Information Management Technology at Georgia Northwestern Technical College, has set up a scholarship through the GNTC Foundation to assist her students in achieving their occupational certification.
 The scholarship is in memory of her late husband who was also a program director for GNTC’s Computer Information Systems program.
 “He believed in the underdog students,” she said. “Charles always felt that no student should fall through the cracks.”
 Donna met Charles, a GNTC faculty member of 16-years who passed in spring of 2019, when she first took over the Health Information Management Technology program in 2013. She said he welcomed her to the 600 Building on the Walker County Campus, where they were both located, and cheered her on as she built the program.
 “Marriage was the absolute last thing I was looking for when I moved here from North Carolina,” Estes said laughing. “Our first date was to a (Chattanooga) Lookouts game on Labor Day of 2013 and we were married in December 2014.”
 Estes said her passion for her program comes from her late husband’s drive to try and make things better for their students. The American Health Information Management Association administers the Registered Health Information Technician exam certification Estes’ students take towards the end of their last semester in the program. In most cases the certification is necessary to land a job post-graduation she said, and finances should not be an issue for those who can’t afford it.
 “The RHIT certification is about $300,” Estes said. “It is my hope this will help someone and Charles’ name will be remembered.”
 With around 50 graduates entering the workforce since she took over the program, Estes’ program boasted a 100% job placement rate for her students in Academic Year 2018. Her online only program has seen graduates enter the Atlanta, Chattanooga and northwest Georgia areas.
 “We are delighted about the establishment of the Charles and Donna Estes Scholarship because it honors and continues the legacy of the late Charles Estes, a dedicated GNTC faculty member,” Lauretta Hannon, director of Institutional Advancement at GNTC said. “The GNTC Foundation is so grateful for her gift of this scholarship.”
 Charles Estes is the only GNTC employee who has won both the Georgia Occupational Award of Leadership award and Rick Perkins Award at the college. He was selected as the GOAL award winner in 1999 while he was a student and nine years later won the Rick Perkins Award as an instructor.

The Flames open a homestand Wednesday that will see them meet five opponents either currently in a playoff spot or just on the outside looking in — the Columbus Blue Jackets, Arizona Coyotes, Vegas Golden Knights, New York Islanders and Winnipeg Jets.
 Calgary, which finished with the second-best regular-season record in 2018-19 before getting stunned by the Colorado Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs last spring, currently sits third in the air-tight Pacific Division, a point back of the Edmonton Oilers for second and five adrift of Vegas for first entering Monday night's play. The Vancouver Canucks, who have lost three straight in regulation, are one off Calgary's pace in the West's first wild- card spot.
 Prior to Monday night, Edmonton and Vancouver had two crucial games in hand, while like Vegas, the Flames have 15 games left on their schedule. Arizona is three points back of Calgary — just 1-5-1 in its last seven at home — with the same number of contests remaining.
 "You check (the standings) every once in a while throughout the day or after games and stuff like that — see who won, who lost," said Flames winger Johnny Gaudreau, who opened the scoring against Florida. "But at the end of the day if we just worry about ourselves we're gonna have no problem getting in."
 Teams look for anything to latch onto at this time of year with margins razor- thin. It could be a big hit, a blocked shot, a player battling through injury or something else that brings the locker-room closer together.
 Gaudreau was the catalyst Sunday with a two-point game after learning his grandfather died Saturday.
 "It sucks losing people," the 26-year-old said as he fought back emotion. "I was pretty pumped up to get that one for him."
 Ward said difficult situations are often inspiring.
 "It hurts," said the coach. "He led us in a lot of ways."
 Calgary will now have to find a way to pull each other up at home with 11 of the team's final 15 games set for confines that have been less than friendly.
 "We've matured over the month of February," Lucic said. "We've learned a lot and what it takes to win on a night-to-night basis.
 "It's a challenge, but that's what the mindset has to be."

 “I felt really good going into the game. It was a pretty cold night but everything was working in the bullpen for me,” said Sieving, whose father, Marc, last week was named head football coach at Elba High School.
 “All my stuff was working. All three pitches (fastball, changeup, breaking ball), everything was spot on. I had some great pitching calls from my pitching coach, and it worked out great for me.”
 The senior right-hander had to be that good. The Wildcats had one hit through six innings and it was 0-0 going to the bottom of the sixth.
 Hunter Sumrall ripped a one-out double to center for Enterprise. Garrett Barefoot’s two-out single to right scored Sumrall for the game’s first run.
 “That was amazing,” Sieving said, adding he went back out three outs away from his no-hitter. He said his mindset shifted a bit.
 “It went from a competitive mindset to more of a finishing mindset,” he said. “I know my job in the seventh. I just had to go out there and do what I had to do.”
 Shortstop Connor Couch turned three ground balls into an easy 1-2-3 inning to seal the no-hitter.
 “It was a team thing, man. I can’t take it all by myself,” Sieving said. “My infield made some great plays for me. Connor was so smooth on those ground balls and made the throws for me.

While the first two months of 2020 have seemed to be wetter than normal, the rainfall total for January and February is just 0.83” more than it was during the same period last year.
 The 11.33” recorded by the weather gauge at Richard B, Russell Airport was however, the wettest February in the last two decades.
 Ty Vaughn, a forecaster with the National Weather Service office in Peachtree City said Rome can expect at least three more inches of rain between now and Thursday afternoon.
 “This doesn’t look like a flash flood event, but we do expect to see a slow steady rise in the rivers,” Vaughn said.
 Much of the most fertile agricultural acreage for row crops lies along the rivers and a lot of that land has been under water for weeks.
 John Lowry, who plants hundreds of acres at several sites primarily along the Oostanaula watershed said Monday that he’s not overly concerned yet. That doesn’t mean he wouldn’t be happy with seven to ten days of dry weather to help prepare the fields for planting later this month and into April.
 Near the Coosa River, Jamie Jordan estimated that between 200 and 250 acres have been flooded by the river off and on early this year.
 “It makes you wonder if this isn’t something of the norm now,” Jordan said. “Used to be that maybe every eight or ten years the river would get out sort of like this year but now it’s a lot more often.”
 Corn generally goes into the ground around the second week of April. That’s because it has typically started to warm up and provide the proper conditions for seed to germinate. Soybeans follow a couple of weeks later.
 “If it keeps it up for another two weeks, perhaps three, we’ll start getting a little antsy,” Lowry said. “Soil moisture is definitely adequate but it can’t hold anymore.”
 A week or so of dry weather would allow farmers to get some fertilizer on the ground as well. Since most of his crops are planted in a no-till method, the fields would then get sprayed to kill any of the weeds that have grown in over the winter and early spring.
 The soil has been so moist that farmers have not been able to start any prescribed burns to kill off invasive weeds either.
 Floyd County Extension Director Keith Mickler said most of the fields are able to dry out pretty quickly once the rain stops. A delay in planting, while not necessarily a problem, could become problematic if it gets dry and stays dry, as has happened in the past.
 “What’ll happen is we won’t get any rain when we need it this summer,” Mickler said. “We’re late getting the crop in and then when we need the water. It pushes into the time of year when we don’t get as much rain, compounding the situation.”
 Farmers who have already put canola in are probably experiencing problems, Mickler said, with a lack of sunlight coupled with nutrients leaching out of the ground with all of the moisture. The planters can’t fertilize again because the ground is too wet to get into the fields.

“That fourth win is always the hardest to get.”
 Harbinson said Sunday’s game was critical, noting the massive difference of being up 3-0 compared to 2-1. He credited goalie Yaniv Perets with keeping the Vees in the game early.
 “He made some huge saves and we were fortunate to get out of the first period ahead 1-0,” said Harbinson. “We were able to get rolling in the last two periods.”
 The Vees are getting contributions up and down the lineup. The line of Tyler Ho, Colton Kalezic and Tristan Amonte has been terrific with 12 points between them.
 “They eat a ton of minutes, kill penalties, play a lot against the other team’s top lines and they provide some offence, too,” said Harbinson.
 Kalezic is tied with Danny Weight for second on the team in points with six (Jay O’Brien leads with four goals and seven points) and has a team-best five assists. Ho has put on a show with four shorthanded goals, including an unforgettable hat-trick of shorties in Game 1.
 “We score eight shorthanded goals all season and (Ho) gets four in three playoff games,” said Harbinson.
 The Vees have done it for the most part without team MVP and captain David Silye, who missed the last two games due to injury.
 “He’s really close to returning … he took the warm-up on Sunday and we decided to err on the side of caution,” said Harbinson. “We’ll see how things look Tuesday night.”
 Perets has been superb in backstopping the first three wins, surrendering just four goals while watching his high-octane offence score 20. Asked if he is considering giving Carl Stankowski a start, Harbinson wouldn’t tip his hand.

As voters streamed into Whitman Town Hall to cast early ballots, Dawn Varley said she was struck by the number who said they still hadn't decided whom to back, even as they approach the voting booth with a ballot in hand.
 In her nearly 10 years as a town clerk, Varley said that's something she hasn't seen before.
 "People aren't sure at this point, and there are still a lot of undecided. Even when they picked up a ballot, they'd say, 'I don't know who I'm voting for,'" Varley said last week. "I see a lot of that, which isn't common at all from the years I've been doing this -- to see voters who aren't sure but are still coming to the polls. Usually they know by then."
 Massachusetts voters who didn't take advantage of last week's early voting will join voters in 13 other states, American Samoa and Democrats living abroad in voting in Tuesday's presidential primaries. Texas and California are among the states casting ballots on Super Tuesday, making it a decisive day for the Democrats seeking their party's nomination.
 Voters in Massachusetts can participate in Democratic, Republican, Libertarian or Green-Rainbow party primaries, depending on their registration. Unenrolled voters can choose which party's primary to participate in when they vote.
 The Democrat ticket features 15 names, although seven of those candidates have dropped out, including former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who dropped out Sunday. The candidates are former Vice President Joe Biden, who won the South Carolina primary Saturday; U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii.
 A new poll by MassINC Polling Group finds Sanders leading Warren by eight points in her home state - 25 percent to 17 percent. Buttigieg and Bloomberg followed at 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively, while Biden ends the top five at 9 percent.
 President Donald Trump is facing former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and perennial candidate Roque "Rocky" De La Fuente in the Republican primary. Former Illinois U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh, who is still on the Republican ballot, dropped out last month.
 MassINC Polling Group found Trump is leading Weld 83 percent to 14 percent in Massachusetts.
 While many voters may still be unsure whom to vote for, the Democrat candidates largely skipped right over Massachusetts in their last effort to garner votes ahead of Tuesday. Bernie Sanders was the only candidate to hold a large-scale rally, which an estimated 13,000 people attended Saturday at Boston Common.
 Even as a member of the Democratic State Committee, Alice Arena, of Weymouth, said she didn't settle on her candidate of choice - Joe Biden - until a few weeks ago. Arena said Biden has the best chance of beating Trump by connecting with voters whose main concern is keeping a roof over their heads.
 "My concern is who is going to speak to the majority and to the people in the middle of the country," said Arena. "I believe that Biden is the person who will speak most to the lunch-bucket issues, the economic issues."
 Arena said voters during a typical election year would have settled into their candidates' camps several months ago, but that hasn't been the case this time around.
 "People are very, very conflicted, and I'm not really running into people who are like, 'OK. I'm totally committed,'" she said.
 Varley said she predicts 55 percent of Whitman's more than 10,600 registered voters will cast ballots, despite a few slow days during early voting. She said some voters may have been holding out for Tuesday in hopes of getting some clarity over the weekend on whom to support based on the results in South Carolina. Biden came out on top there with a nearly 30-point win.
 "Early voting doesn't increase voter turnout in the end," she said. "Voters who come out Super Tuesday just end up coming out early, but they would vote either way."
 In hopes of adding some fun to voting, Varley created a "selfie station" where voters can take photos with "I voted" signs. Varley said voting staff also give out prizes for every 100th voter who comes through.
 "People are totally enjoying it," she said. "It's a way to add a little fun."
 In Weymouth, Town Clerk Kathy Deree said she originally predicted that 62 percent of voters would come out for the primary, but she thinks it could be a little lower based on low turnout during early voting.
 She also said voters seem to be unusually undecided on whom to support.
 "Those who were coming in early to vote were just standing in front of the ballot reading it over and over," she said. "Voters in this election seem very indecisive."
 Quincy Town Clerk Nicole Crispo said the city averaged 300 voters a day during early voting, which was fewer than she hoped for.
 "It's not the worst we've seen, but I think next time we will do a little more outreach about parking and such," she said.
 Crispo said unenrolled voters who came into city hall were even undecided on which ballot to take.
 "They were making their decisions on the fly," she said.
 Crispo said she expects a turnout of 45 percent Tuesday.
 "But come November, it will be so busy," she said. "We anticipate it will be much bigger in November."

Kuna ended the regular season with a 17-7 record.
 Idaho Falls, meanwhile, will open the tournament on Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m., also at Borah High School, against the District 4-5 champion Preston, the top-ranked team in the state with a 23-1 record.
 “It feels amazing to have the kids believe and fight like they did,” Blackfoot coach Cody Shelley said. “Both teams led in the fourth quarter. We ended up coming through at the end with some key stops and some key scores.”
 The game was close throughout, with the Tigers holding an 11-10 lead after the first period. The lead went back and forth throughout the first period and in the second, the Broncos began to emerge with a lead by out-shooting the Tigers 16-11 in the period and taking a 26-22 lead to the locker room at haltime.
 It was the Tigers’ turn to seize momentum in the third period and they would out-duel the Broncos to the tune of 17-13, to tie the score and send things into the fourth stanza, all tied up at 39.

The expanding number of coronavirus cases in California and Washington state spread through community contact have heightened concerns.
 But experts warn the rising case counts in the U.S. do not necessarily reveal that the virus is spreading rapidly across the country. They also urged the public to stay calm and keep the virus in perspective.
 “Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself. Fear and panic are dangerous,” World Health Organization director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “It’s fine to be concerned and worried, but let’s calm down and do the right things.”
 So far, testing for the virus in the U.S. has been very low, said Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch.

Ideas bandied about outside the GM meeting rooms since Ayres, who became the oldest goalie in league history to win his regular-season debut and the first EBUG credited with a win, was forced to play nearly 29 minutes for Carolina have included making sure a member of each team's backroom staff can suit up in a pinch or having a minimum threshold in terms of ability across the board.
 But because the emergency goalie could be forced to suit up for either team, it's already in the best interest of the home club to provide the best option available. Ayres practises with the Leafs on a regular basis and has served as a backup in the American Hockey League under similar circumstances.
 "It's been in the news and was again here of late," Vegas Golden Knights GM Kelly McCrimmon said. "But I think everyone's pretty comfortable with the procedures that we have in place.
 "It's such a rare occurrence."
 Teams are responsible for submitting a list of approved EBUGs to the league — there are 136 currently on file — before each season.
 Traditional hockey markets have plenty of options when it comes to finding former junior or university goalies (ex-pros currently aren't allowed), but what about in warmer climates?
 "There's probably more than you realize," said Cheveldayoff, who added the Los Angeles Kings held tryouts. "Once the word has gotten out, there's been a lot of capable guys."
 So the current system remains in place.
 "We're fine with it," Tallon said.
 At least until the next EBUG is called into action.
 NHL KEEPING TEAMS IN THE LOOP ON CORONAVIRUS
 Cheveldayoff said as coronavirus continues to spread, the NHL is providing clubs with updates. "They're the focal people that talk to the bigger governmental bodies and the different people that have the best information," Cheveldayoff said. "They've pushed that out to us on a regular basis." The International Ice Hockey Federation, meanwhile, cancelled six tournaments in the men's and women's under-18 category on Monday, while Switzerland's professional league suspended its playoffs until March 15.
 AN EXAMINATION OF LAST YEAR'S RULE CHANGES
 GMs went over a number of the tweaks to the rulebook instituted at the beginning of the season, including a penalty for unsuccessful challenges for goalie interference and video reviews for high-sticking infractions. Through 1,015 games this season, there have been 54 challenges for goalie interference, with 23 getting overturned. That's compared to 141 challenges, with just 33 getting overturned, at the same point of the 2018-19 schedule. There's also been eight challenges for game stoppage — including hand passes and sequences where the puck goes out of play in the offensive zone resulting in a goal — but none have been overturned to date.

In this article we will cover ADUs as a solution to combat our affordable housing crisis. An ADU or Accessory Dwelling Unit is a unit that is secondary to the primary residence of the homeowner and is commonly referenced as a mother-in-law suite or a granny flat. ADUs can be crafted from scratch as a stand-alone housing unit or can be created from an existing structure such as an extra bedroom, outhouse, barn, shed, or garage. The finished product is a small housing unit that has an area for sleeping, bathing, and eating that is separate from the primary residence.
 ADUs offer several benefits to a community; chief among them is their ability to promote affordable housing. An ADU allows homeowners the opportunity to maximize the housing potential of their home as a rental unit. The rental market in Jackson County is tightly constrained with close to 50% of our renters facing some sort of housing cost burden, i.e. spending over 30% of their household income in housing costs (Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau).
 ADUs offer a quick housing solution because they give homeowners the opportunity to put more rental units on the market without having to build large-scale apartment complexes or full size homes. Additionally, since ADUs are typically smaller than an apartment or a full size home they should, in theory, rent at a lower cost allowing renters the opportunity for a more affordable housing option.

“I just kind of wished that there was a two week break there,” Redding said. “Going from football to basketball practice, going from the Super Bowl game right into the basketball season was tough. The football season is a long grind, starting back in August. It was just tough doing back-to-back seasons for so long.
 “It just kind of made sense in that I was retiring from teaching, to keep it (coaching) to one sport.”
 Russo succeeded Margaret Conaty as the Mansfield High athletic director after also serving as a football coach. Before that, he was the head coach at Tri- County Regional High in Franklin for six seasons, ending in 2002.
 “The biggest change that we’ve seen has been the growth of girls’ sports,” Russo said. “It really started with Margaret (Conaty), she started the swimming and gymnastics programs and I added the girls’ hockey program (a co- op with Foxboro High and Oliver Ames High).
 “I look at all of the opportunities for our student-athletes,” Russo added.
 Bolstered by commitment from the town, School Committee and administrative staff, Mansfield High — with a student enrollment of nearly 1,300 — is one of the larger members of the Hockomock League and has consistently fielded competitive teams in every sport.
 “Our numbers (of participation) have grown,” Russo said of the number of athletes participating in one or several sports throughout the academic year. “There is tremendous enthusiasm for athletics here in town and from the students. We have good numbers across the board, in all sports, of kids that participate.”
 Another contributing factor to the achievements of the MHS Athletic Department has been co-existing with its Hockomock League members, a homogeneous group of principals, athletic directors and coaches who understand the common needs and goals.
 “That’s the advantage of playing in the Hockomock League, there are like- minded athletic directors and coaches,” Russo said of Taunton High hosting the MIAA basketball South Sectional late rounds,
 “It was like us hosting Attleboro for the basketball game,” said Russo, noting his work with AHS athletic director and basketball coach Mark Houle. “ Mark and I worked before the game on what needed to be done, the crowd etc. and our principals (Bill Runey at AHS and Mary Watkins at MHS) made sure that the kids from both schools were in the right sections with our site supervisors so that the night goes off without a hitch.”
 That’s not to forget all of the bus schedules, the flooded fields and tennis courts, as well as the rescheduling of games due to inclement weather.
 “That’s what’s great about the Hockomock League,” said Russo. “Everyone knows how each school is going to run things. It’s a tight-knit group.”

As marketing projects are generally creative it can be more complex. Moreover, marketing project management is naturally iterative, in light of the fact that the data and information that groups need to settle on insightful choices just ends up noticeably accessible as the undertaking moves forward. In the past, project managers in charge of promoting ventures were compelled to use manual, wasteful or excessively complex solutions.

It's also the Brier main draw debut for Nunavut skip Jake Higgs, lead Ed MacDonald and second Christian Smitheram. They were 0-4 after dropping 7-4 decisions Monday to Quebec's Alek Bedard and Nova Scotia's Jamie Murphy.
 Kohlenberg, who works for the federal Department of Justice, moved to the territory to fill in for a lawyer on paternity leave.
 MacDonald noticed him practising shots one day at the club. He introduced himself and asked if Kohlenberg would be interested in joining his team since there was a vacancy due to illness.
 Given his age, Kohlenberg thought he might be a better fit on a seniors or masters team. MacDonald noted that coming on board would give him a 33 per cent chance of getting to the Brier.
 "I asked, 'Well, how do you arrange for that?'" Kohlenberg said. "He said, 'There's only two other teams in the (territorial) competition, so we'll be the third one.'"
 Kohlenberg decided to give it a go.
 "So the (playdowns) for the Brier starts on a Friday evening," he said. "We have our first practice Friday afternoon and I meet the other two guys on the team I'm playing with. And I curl with Ed for the first time and we happen to go through undefeated and end of story.
 "Here I am living the big dream."

A bill that would have let voters abolish their county police department is dead — following indictments of the police chief and three former high-ranking officers in a coastal Georgia county.
 “We’re not going to move forward with it,” Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, R-Rome, said Monday. “This sort of spurred some action, which was what we wanted.”
 Senate Bill 317 would have allowed county police departments that work alongside city police and sheriff’s offices in Georgia to be dissolved at local governments’ choosing or by voters.
 The Georgia General Assembly would have been able to put the question on the ballot if the county government refused.
 The proposal sparked accusations of overreach from the Association County Commissions of Georgia. Floyd County is one of the jurisdictions in the state with both a city and county police force and a sheriff’s office.
 But Hufstetler — a former Floyd County commissioner who said he supports all three local agencies — said he co-sponsored the bill because it was aimed directly at “a situation in Glynn County.”
 “Now there’s indictments, they’ve brought in an acting police chief to straighten things out ... and they’re going to have a nonbinding referendum,” he explained.
 Sen. William T. Ligon Jr., R-Brunswick, filed the bill after a grand jury report last November condemned the Glynn County Police Department over alleged officer misconduct and poor coordination with the local sheriff’s office.
 The report recommended letting voters decide whether to merge the county police department with the sheriff’s department. County officials declined to take action.
 But the Brunswick News reports indictments were issued late Thursday against Glynn County Police Chief John Powell, Vidalia Police Chief Brian Scott and two former Glynn County officers.
 The prosecution will be handled by former Clayton County District Attorney Tracy Lawson after local District Attorney Jackie Johnson stepped aside in November.
 Powell is charged with four counts of violating his oath of office, two counts of influencing a witness and one county of attempting to commit perjury.
 Scott, formerly Powell’s chief of staff until he took the Vidalia job in July, is charged with two counts of violating his oath and one count apiece of influencing a witness and criminal attempt to commit perjury.
 Also charged are former Glynn County officers David Haney and David Hassler.
 The charges are the latest development in a case that began when a Glynn County narcotics officer was found to have been having sex with two confidential informants.
 Allegations later emerged that evidence was suppressed in a fatal police chase involving the Glynn-Brunswick Narcotics Enforcement Team.
 After pleading guilty to two counts of violation his oath, former narcotics officer James Cassada agreed to testify about further wrongdoing within the police department.
 The indictment alleges Powell and Scott violated their oaths by failing to address allegations that Glynn County investigator Dustin Simpson had an improper relationship with Brian Highsmith, a friend who had been convicted for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.
 Evidence included a photo the two posed for, as well as a report from a federal agent that he saw Highsmith illegally possessing a gun at a bar, with Simpson then showing his badge to tell a bar employee to protect Highsmith.
 The indictment also accuses Powell and Scott of improperly giving Simpson a chance to change his story during interviews and testimony and failing to require Haney to meet with a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent.
 Both Powell and Scott were placed on administrative leave by their employers.
 Jay Wiggins, director of the Glynn County Emergency Management Agency and a former Glynn County officer, has been named interim county police chief there.
 Hassler and Haney’s charges claim they ignored and covered up Cassada’s improper sexual relationships with confidential informants.
 Arraignments are expected in about a month.

CWI will not, however, operate the authority's recycling program, which has been as much as $400,000 in the red. Authority members are working on ways to get the program closer to a break-even point.
 One advantage the Cherokee landfill has is a permit to accept waste from outside Colbert County and outside the state. The county would not be able to do that had they simply purchased the landfill from CWI, Heflin said.
 Outside waste will also help provide additional material to mix with the paper sludge brought to the landfill from Essity, formerly SCA Tissue.
 Tuscumbia Mayor Kerry Underwood, chairman of both solid waste authorities, said the landfill will be purchased for $11 million, but they're selling $16 million in bonds so two additional cells at the landfill can be developed.
 Witmer said the revenue bonds that will be sold are backed by the revenue created by the landfill.
 "It's a conduit for us to be able to raise money at a lower interest rate," Witmer said.
 For the county, CWI is offering a permitted, operating landfill with room for expansion.
 Heflin said the authority has locked in tipping fees the local entities pay to dump in the landfill, so rates should not increase in that time period.
 The royalty payments should offset any increased costs the cities incur when they transport material to the new landfill.

What will Mansfield High be like without Russo, Redding and Harrington?
 “Good question,” Russo said while shepherding Hornet fans into the stands and chaperoning at Taunton High School over the weekend where the Mansfield High boys’ basketball team was participating in the MIAA Division 1 South Sectional semifinals.
 “It’s been a long time, but I missed some events of my daughters (Ava and Emma) with gymnastics and basketball and I just felt that it was the right time to give up basketball in that I was retiring from teaching as well,” Redding said upon returning from being honored the Mass. Football Coaches Association and Gridiron Club of Boston Coach of the Year.
 Although he is leaving the court, Redding will most likely be returning for a 33rd season as the Mansfield High football coach. Likely to replace him as the Hornet girls’ basketball coach will be former MHS standout and current assistant coach Heather McPherson, one of Redding’s former players.
 Redding’s Mansfield High girls’ basketball teams did not qualify for the MIAA Tournament during his first two seasons as head coach, but the Hornets were regulars in postseason play thereafter, with a streak of eight consecutive tournament appearances snapped this season after a 9-13 record.
 “I’ll probably end up helping out coaching one of the girls’ MetroWest (league) teams,” said Redding, who has two daughters — 11-year-old Ava and 14-year-old Emma. “They’re both into gymnastics, play some indoor field hockey and basketball. There were games that I was hoping to get to, but I just couldn’t with my football and basketball schedules.”
 During the 2019 football season, Redding guided the Hornets to 11 victories and 10 straight wins culminating with Mansfield High’s eighth MIAA Super Bowl championship at Gillette Stadium.
 “Talent will win you a lot of games, but it was character and leadership that got us the Super Bowl championship,” Redding said of Hornets taking state titles this century also in 2003, 2204, 2010 and 2013.
 With the Hornet football team’s nearly annual participation in the MIAA playoffs and Super Bowl game on the first weekend of December, Redding was often doing double duty between coaching on the gridiron and basketall court.

The election in "2018 was a referendum on Trump, practically a vote against every Republican on the ballot," said Dick Wadhams, a veteran Republican strategist and former party chairman. "But this year is different. Trump is on the ballot. If Sanders also is on the ballot, that puts Colorado in play."

“He had a bad outing last week and he justed pounded the (strike) zone and stayed ahead of hitters all day,” the coach said. “He’s a guy for us that we rely on heavily. He’s one of our top three arms — heavy fastball, got a lot of movement and sink on it. He’s got a nice changeup and when he gets his breaking stuff going he’s a three-pitch guy.
 “He’s not going to miss over the middle a lot. He’s going to stay on the outer half of the plate and work the ball in and out. When he stays down in the zone he’s very, very tough to hit. I thought he did a good job of that Friday night — getting ahead with strike 1 and going from there.”
 Sieving threw just 89 pitches, 62 were strikes. He also threw first-pitch strikes to 16 of the 23 batters he faced.
 Enterprise won two other games in its final at bat, including its opener Thursday night against Northwest Rankin, a traditional power in Mississippi.
 The Wildcats gave up four runs in the bottom of the fifth and trailed 6-2. Sumrall got a big lead-off home run in top of the sixth. EHS added another run in that inning on Couch’s groundout. In the seventh, they rallied for three runs and came away with a 7-6 victory.
 “That was a huge win for us,” Whitton said. “Down four with two at bats left and we battled back. Any time you win the first game of a road trip it’s huge. And to beat the quality of ball club we did was big for us.”
 In the first of two games Friday, Trey Cavanaugh pitched 6 2/3 innings in a 4-2 victory over Gulf Shores. Austin Acreman got the one-out save.
 “Pitching kept us in the games all weekend,” the coach said. “We had quality starts and relievers kept us right there. We started Colin Marsh in the first game and he did an outstanding job of getting ahead of hitters. Dylan Dalrymple earned the win in relief.
 “Then Friday Trey took a no-hitter into the fifth. I thought he did an outstanding job of mixing his pitches.”
 Sieving’s no-hitter came later Friday night.
 In Saturday’s finale, Enterprise edged Brookhaven 5-4 by scoring a run in the bottom of the seventh to complete the 4-0 road trip. A walk, a bunt and two passed balls gave the Wildcats the victory. Pinch runner Tal Sessions scored the walk-off run with one out.
 Lane Danford started the game on the mound for the Wildcats and gave up three hits and two runs — none earned — in five innings. Triston Bartling pitched the sixth and Acreman worked the seventh and earned the win
 “We had younger guys in the game Saturday. We’re up 4-0 and you blink and it’s 4-2. You blink again and it’s 4-3,” Whitton said. “Those younger guys never flinched. They kept their heads down and made some big plays in big-time situations to get us out of an inning. Guys made some big pitches to get us out of some innings.”
 There were plenty of positives that came from the Mississippi road trip, the coach said.
 “I think the biggest thing this weekend was we took 27 guys over there and all 27 guys played a role — whether pinch running, pitching, playing defense, hitting, whatever,” Whitton said. “Everybody played, everybody got a chance to show what they can do for us and how they can help us.
 “We talked about that Saturday after the game. I think everybody on our team understands whether you’re a freshman, sophomore, junior or senior, if you were in Mississippi with us you have a role. Whatever that role is, do it to the best of your ability. I think guys are starting to see that and they know they can help us in a certain way. We’re going to have to use different guys in different roles throughout the year. A lot of guys proved that they can handle that role this weekend.”

 Making it to Birmingham
 Six local teams clawed their way to the BJCC’s Legacy Arena last week, site of the AHSAA State Championship Basketball Tournament.
 Although none came home with a blue map (championship trophy), it’s no small feat to survive the grind of a long season just to qualify for the finals.
 So kudos to Deshler’s girls team and Lauderdale County’s boys team for playing in the championship game in their respective classes.
 And congratulations to the Red Bay and Brooks boys teams and to the Mars Hill and Lauderdale County girls for making it the state semifinals.
 The losses might sting for a while, but later on those players, coaches and fans will realize what an accomplishment it was just to get there.

 Last week, we wrote about Zeus, a dog who is the unofficial greeter at the Florence-Lauderdale Animal Services building.
 Zeus was hit by a car when he was 9 months old. Although the veterinarian told his owner Zeus would never walk again, his owner didn’t want him to be euthanized. A group called Joey’s PAW provided a wheelchair for the dog, and he was up and running.
 Unfortunately, the owner is unable to care for Zeus, which is why he can be found rolling around the shelter. He is still searching for his “forever home,” and a Minnesota rescue group says they will take him if local volunteers can find a way to transport him.
 We wish Zeus the very best.

Jackson County Commissioners have been asked to individually submit the lists of roads they think should be submitted for funding in the three major, standard opportunities offered by the state of Florida for assistance to its 67 county governments.
 Public Transportation Director Scotty Taylor told the board what his own picks were late last month, saying he now wants to see their suggestions, so their choices can be discussed and the matter decided, so the submittals might be made as quickly as possible.
 The county must submit its applications by March 20 to be in the running for funding this year, and the state limits the number that can be submitted by each county.

IDAHO FALLS – It may have taken three tries in a week, but the Blackfoot Broncos claimed their first 4A 6th District boys’ basketball title since 1992 by beating the Idaho Falls Tigers 61-56 at Bonneville High School on Saturday night.
 The Broncos had downed Idaho Falls the previoud Monday night, securing their first state tournament bid in a number of years, but then dropped a Thursday night contest to the Tigers, setting up a winner-take-all game on Saturday for the district title and the district’s top seeding in the state tournament which gets underway on Thursday in the Treasure Valley.
 The Broncos will open the tournament in the Thursday night-cap at 8 p.m. against the Kuna Kavemen, the second seed from the Third District, at Borah High School.

Georgia lawmakers began qualifying Monday for a spate of races in the 2020 elections, both for state and federal offices.
 The 2020 elections see every seat in the Georgia House of Representative and Senate up for grabs as well as all 14 U.S. House seats and the state’s two U.S. Senate seats.
 Candidates and incumbents for dozens of state and federal seats had signed up within hours of the qualifying period’s commencement.
 Notably, all three Republican candidates for Georgia’s two U.S. Senate seats made appearances at the Georgia Capitol building shortly after qualifying, which kicked off at 9 a.m. The qualifying period runs until Friday at noon.
 Each angled for recognition as an “outsider” candidate or incumbent with a strong affinity for President Donald Trump’s policies.
 Back-to-back showings at the Capitol of U.S. Rep. Doug Collins and U.S. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who are competing with each other to fill the remainder of retired U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson’s term, underscored the tense party in- fighting in Georgia this election season.
 Standing feet from where Loeffler was scheduled to speak, Collins railed against the attack ads by his opponents’ allies depicting him as an entrenched Washington politician.
 He slammed the billionaire Atlantan who has amassed $10.5 million for her campaign so far as out of touch with Georgia voters, particularly the state’s farmers. Loeffler is seeking to woo voters with her background growing up on an Illinois farm.
 “Today begins a new day,” Collins said. “I say bring it on. You can spend your money, but we’re going to have a debate.”
 Loeffler then stepped out from a side room of the Capitol’s North Wing alongside several high-profile supporters including Gov. Brian Kemp, who appointed her in December to hold Isakson’s seat until the November election.
 Despite the recent campaign ads, Loeffler pledged to run a Georgia-centric campaign aimed at uniting the state’s Republican party against Democratic challengers.
 “The state should not be at risk,” Loeffler said. “I will not let it be at risk.”
 Georgia Democrats eyeing an opening in the race for Isakson’s old seat highlighted the intra-party conflict on Monday.
 Alex Floyd, a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Georgia, called the jousting between Loeffler and Collins “a no-win scenario” for state Republicans that has resulted “in a multimillion-dollar slugfest.”
 “While Republicans fight over who can appeal most to a narrow base, Georgia Democrats are ready to focus on the issues that matter to Georgia families,” Floyd said.
 Democratic contenders, especially presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, loomed large in the speech from U.S. Sen. David Perdue, who is seeking re-election to Georgia’s other U.S. Senate seat. The GOP incumbent called for beating back support for policies splitting the national Democratic party like Sanders’ Medicaid-For-All plan.
 “What we have to do is to make sure once and for all in the state of Georgia that the road to socialism will never run through Georgia,” Perdue said.
 The two U.S. Senate seats have each drawn a trio of Democratic challengers, including pastor Raphael Warnock. Warnock, Loeffler, Collins and others will compete for Isakson’s old seat in a free-for-all special election scheduled the same day as the Nov. 3 general election.
 Two Democrats challenging Perdue qualified on Monday: former Columbus Mayor Teresa Tomlinson and James Knox of Evans, a U.S. Air Force retiree.
 U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, who was recently diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, was also on hand at the Capitol for qualifying after rallying in Selma, Alabama, on Sunday. As a young civil rights leader, Lewis was severely beaten during a 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge at Selma.
 Besides Lewis, other incumbent Georgia congressmen who signed up Monday to seek re-election included U.S. Reps. Buddy Carter, R-Savannah; Sanford Bishop, D-Albany; Hank Johnson, D-Stone Mountain; Lucy McBath, D-Roswell; Jody Hice, R-Greensboro; Barry Loudermilk, R-Cassville and David Scott, D-Atlanta.
 Several vacant House seats drew a good deal of attention on the first day of qualifying.
 Republican state Sen. Renee Unterman, R-Buford, and Republican businessman Mark Gonsalves signed up for the GOP primary for the 7th Congressional District seat being vacated by Rep. Mark Woodall, R-Lawrenceville. Democrat Carolyn Bourdeaux, who came close to beating Woodall in 2018, also qualified on Monday.
 In the 9th District, which Collins is vacating to run for the Senate, Republican state Reps. Mark Gurtler, R-Tiger, and Kevin Tanner, R-Dawsonville, tossed their hats into the Republican primary race. Three other GOP candidates – retiree Maria Strickland, crane operator Michael Boggus and attorney Ethan Underwood – also entered the GOP primary contest in the heavily Republican district.

"We've communicated in no uncertain terms that the behaviour is inexcusable," Villanueva said. “I mean, people are grieving for the loss of their loved ones. To have that on top of what they've already gone through is unconscionable.”
 Villanueva said the Sheriff's Department doesn't have a specific policy about taking photographs on personal cellphones. But he plans to change that situation and would like to see a state law making it illegal to take unauthorized photos of accident scenes depicting dead bodies.
 Villanueva told KABC-TV that the deputies are facing an investigation and possible disciplinary action. He wouldn't specify the kind of actions they might face.
 The Sheriff's Department has a policy against taking and sharing crime scene photos, but it doesn't apply to accident scenes, the sheriff told KCBS-TV.
