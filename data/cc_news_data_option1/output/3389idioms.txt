Posted @withregram • @unicef Welcome to the world, Daisy Dove Bloom! We are honoured to introduce Goodwill Ambassadors @KatyPerry and @OrlandoBloom’s new bundle of joy.⠀ ⠀ “We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter,” Katy and Orlando told us.⠀ ⠀ “But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was. Communities around the world are still experiencing a shortage of healthcare workers and every eleven seconds a pregnant woman or newborn dies, mostly from preventable causes. Since COVID-19 many more newborn lives are at risk because of the increased lack of access to water, soap, vaccines and medicines that prevent diseases. As parents to a newborn, this breaks our hearts, as we empathize with struggling parents now more than ever.⠀ ⠀ “As UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors, we know UNICEF is there, on the ground, doing whatever it takes to make sure every expecting mother has access to a trained health worker and access to quality healthcare. In celebration of the heart we know our daughter already has, we have set up a donation page to celebrate DDB’s arrival. By supporting them, you are supporting a safe start to life and reimagining a healthier world for every child. We hope your can bloom with generosity.⠀ ⠀ Gratefully-⠀ ⠀ Katy & Orlando.”⠀ ⠀ Please tap the link in our bio to support the most precious gift: a healthy child.

Varios profesores han manifestado que, actualmente, la Comunidad Valenciana es la comunidad que mejor está preparando el plan de la vuelta al cole. Por su parte, Vicent Marzà, consejero de Educación de la Generalitat de la Comunidad Valenciana, manifiesta que el plan de la vuelta al cole lo han acordado con la comunidad educativa, tienen la firma de los diferentes sindicatos de educación pública y de la totalidad de la escuela concertada. Explica que es un plan que concreta cómo pueden hacer que las aulas sean seguras. Por ello, indica que han bajado la ratio de alumnos, han contratado a más de 4.400 profesores "para que atiendan mejor al alumnado", han comprado el material de protección pertinente y han contratado a más de 3.000 monitores de comedor, así como a más personal de limpieza. "Lo que hemos hecho es aplicar a la realidad los principios generales del sistema sanitario y de protección para que las aulas sean seguras y para que los niños vuelvan al cole", destaca. En cuanto a la bajada de ratio de alumnos, comenta que han determinado con cada centro el número de éstos según sus necesidades. Y de forma general, lo que han establecido en todos los centros es que "los niños más pequeños estarán en grupos de máximo 20 alumnos". Además, afirma que han habilitado más espacios en los centros educativos y también han colaborado con los ayuntamientos para que les dejaran otros espacios. En el caso de los alumnos de los últimos cursos de primaria, de secundaria y de bachillerato "hemos establecido que van a estar a metro y medio de distancia". En caso de que algún alumno dé positivo en coronavirus, explica que tienen un protocolo con Sanidad, en el cual determinan que acompañarán al alumno a una sala Covid y se pondrán en contacto con salud pública. Por otro lado, si hay positivos en un aula estable, "se hará un seguimiento a todos los alumnos y deberán estar en casa, mientras, darán las clases telemáticas". Por último, ha manifestado que han comprado más de 30.000 tablets y aulas virtuales para que los alumnos “hagan el mismo horario que harían de forma presencial”.
