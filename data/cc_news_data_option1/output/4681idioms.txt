JOHNS CREEK, Ga. — The Johns Creek City Council continued discussions Nov. 2 on how it will distribute the more than $3 million it expects to receive in federal coronavirus relief funds.


  Getting direction on a plan everyone would like, though, proved divisive.


  The council reached a bare consensus, 4-3, on a tier system proposed at an earlier work session that would provide greater relief to those businesses hit hardest by Gov. Brian Kemp’s order to shut down certain businesses during the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic in April.


  At an Oct. 19 work session, council members Erin Elwood and Stephanie Endres proposed a plan to distribute the funds to target local small to medium-sized, brick-and-mortar businesses and local nonprofits.


  Their two-tier system would provide greatest aid to those businesses forced to close operations by the governor’s order. Tier two would include businesses that faced some negative impact from the order but were able to remain open in a limited capacity, businesses like restaurants and certain retail stores.


  Qualifying businesses would be required to be in good standing and have proof that they were in operation prior to the pandemic and continue to remain in operation.


  At the conclusion of the Oct. 19 work session, the council agreed that while not perfect, the tier system was the best option to help as many needful businesses as possible.


  At the Nov. 2 meeting, Councilman Larry Zaprowski repeated his concerns that the tier plan favors one group of businesses over another. He said the city would be picking winners and losers, and he called for a flat rate award for all impacted business.


  “I think most businesses were affected negatively by this pandemic,” Zaprowski said. “So, rather than me say, ‘Hey, your business gets more money than the other,’ I would rather make it fair to all the businesses who need it.”


  Elwood countered, citing one resident she had heard from who labeled the technique of giving all business a flat rate as “lazy” and made it appear the council didn’t want to take the steps to identify the businesses that really need the help.


  “Stephanie and I have already done that work,” Elwood said. “I just don't want to step back from that because the decision is somewhat uncomfortable. I think it's a good decision and I think it's a fair decision.”


  The council then threw itself a curveball by considering a proposal to tap into the funds to provide help for individuals in need.


  The proposal called for reducing the business assistance by $300,000, and making that money available for individual assistance with rent and utilities. Council members suggested the funds be distributed through non-profits.


  Endres said taking $100,000 from tier one and $200,000 from tier two would still provide 325 of the most afflicted businesses with grants of $5,000 and 358 businesses within tier two grants of $3,000.


  Assistant City Manager Kimberly Greer said city staff will move forward with the business relief program and post the information on the city’s website. The city will accept applications through Nov. 20 and review them until Dec. 4. Checks would be written Dec. 7 and mailed the week of Dec. 14.


  Greer also said she plans to have a program overview and eligibility criteria for the individual assistance program at the next work session Nov. 16.

GENOA (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 16th November, 2020) Lapses in detecting would-be terrorists like the Nice attacker are caused by the flaws in the migration policy and not in the work of the intelligence and security services, Marco Lombardi, director of the Italian Team for Security, Terroristic Issues and Managing Emergencies (ITSTIME), told Sputnik in an interview.


  The 21-year-old Tunisian man who stabbed dead three people in the Notre-Dame church in Nice on October 29, Brahim Aoussaoui, arrived from Tunisia on the Italian island of Lampedusa in September along with other migrants. On October 9, he was ordered to leave the country, since he had no right to ask for asylum, but he managed not only to stay in the country but also to move across the whole territory of Italy and reach France.


  "When illegal immigration is so high, once it arrives in your country it is too late to contain it; you must contain it outside the national border. Consequently, it is possible that a person like this escapes, and that there are no control centers when he arrives and eventually he goes where he wants. At that point, the information is lost," Lombardi, who is also member of the Governmental Commission on Counter Radicalization and of the Strategic Policy Committee of the Italian foreign ministry, said.


  He stressed that the lax control over the movement of migrants into and across Italy is mainly to blame for potential terrorists making their way into the rest of Europe.


  "So in this case we cannot speak of intelligence errors, we cannot speak of police errors, we can speak of errors in the management of migration flows into our country, in a sense that we cannot manage immigration in this way, because it will happen again that anyone who decides to escape will be able to escape and get lost in some corner of Europe. The problem is not security agencies, the problem is the inability of Italian governments to govern immigration," he continued.


  Tunisia is not considered to be an unsafe country, therefore migrants arriving to the Italian shores from there are not eligible for asylum. Most of the arriving migrants are illegal, Lombardi noted, but given the high number of people, controls are very slow and inefficient. Identification process usually starts on cruise ships, where they are put for quarantine in the current circumstances of the pandemic.


  "What happens given such a large number of people is that, if a hundred arrive every day, at least ten run away every day. They escape from the centers where they are placed, they climb over the fences, but there is little to do," Lombardi said.


  On November 13, EU home affairs ministers held a video conference to discuss the fight against terrorism and the contentious new pact on migration in Europe as the EU officially linked the rise of terrorism with the migration crisis that the bloc has been totally unable to settle since 2015. At the final press conference, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the EU should optimize protection at the borders.


  Soon after the attack in Nice, multiple shootings took place in Vienna, resulting in the death of four people and 22 injured. The gunman was later identified to be an Austrian citizen of ethnic Albanian descent and a supporter of the Islamic State terrorist organization (IS, Deash, banned in Russia).


  After the attacks in Nice and Vienna, Italy decided to intensify controls at the nation's borders. Italian and French interior ministries agreed that the two countries' police forces would form joint border patrol brigades. However, the level of terrorist alert was not changed.


  "I don't think that after Paris, Nice and Vienna, the situation has changed for Italy. For years we have had a real threat that is brought by those called 'lone wolves.' This type of threat has been present for some years and it is very difficult to intercept, because when an organization is missing, you lack the signals that you can detect and understand, like those that an organization leaves before making an attack.

Jacob Young, the Redcar and Cleveland MP, and Basingstoke MP Maria Miller, are also self-isolating after being told on Sunday that they had recently been in contact with someone who tested positive.


  On Wednesday afternoon, Mrs Miller was seated next to Mr Anderson in a House of Commons debate on Armistice Day.


  Downing Street has insisted that social distancing measures were observed at the 35-minute meeting between the prime minister and the Tory MPs.


  "We take every possible step to ensure that hand sanitiser is made available to people as soon as they arrive at the building and it is available throughout the building as you travel through it," Mr Johnson's official spokesman said on Monday.


  "But as I say, factors such as the length of the meeting meant that it was the advice of Test and Trace that the prime minister should self-isolate, and he of course will follow that instruction."


  Asked about a photograph that appeared to show Mr Johnson and Mr Anderson standing less than two metres apart at the meeting, the spokesman said: "They are stood side by side, rather than face to face."


  The spokesman also defended the prime minister's decision to hold the meeting in person rather than virtually, saying such meetings are allowed under the current coronavirus restrictions.

Microsoft will "absolutely" buy more studios in the future and wants future games to be "either first or better or best" according to Phil Spencer and Tim Stuart.


  According to _VGC_, Stuart's comments came during the Jefferies Interactive Entertainment conference, which was held last week. As _we previously reported_, Microsoft announced plans in September to acquire ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks, Arkane Studios, and id Software. Naturally, this had players wondering if future Bethesda titles like _Starfield_ and _Elder Scrolls 6_ would be _Xbox Series X_ exclusives, and recent _comments from Phil Spencer only fueled the discourse_.


  When discussing the hotly-contested topic, Stuart clarified Microsoft's plans for future Bethesda titles. "What we'll do in the long run is we don't have intentions of just pulling all of Bethesda content out of Sony or Nintendo or otherwise. But what we want is we want that content to be either first or better or best, or pick your differentiated experience, on our platforms. We will want Bethesda content to show up the best on our platforms."


  This is an important distinction to make, as recent comments from _Phil Spencer at Twitch's GlitchCon_ that this problem will surface again. "In terms of continuing to invest in new studios and new games and new content, absolutely we have to do that," Spencer confirmed at GlitchCon. "It's important that we continue to build out the library of games that are available on Xbox. We'll double the size of our studios organization when we add Bethesda, and we're going to continue to invest in great games so that people can find their next favorite game on our platform."


  So, while Microsoft has plans to acquire more game studios in the future, it's safe to say that doesn't mean the studio will be claiming exclusivity over formerly cross-platform franchises. They'll just be better on Xbox...which may sway your purchasing decisions, anyway.

Arsenal will face Leeds United this weekend when club football returns after the international break.


  The Gunners were beaten 3-0 by Aston Villa in their last league game, and they will be looking to get back to winning ways in this match.


  Arsenal has now lost three of their last four league games, and they know that isn’t the form of a team that wants to play Champions League football.


  The international break has given the players the chance to forget the last game, but they will return to face a very tough Leeds United.


  The good news is that the Whites will be without one of their key players who has returned from the international break injured.


  The Yorkshire Post claims that North Macedonian winger, Ezgjan Alioski has returned to Leeds with an injury.


  He had been away with his national squad and he was part of the team that secured the country’s first qualification for the European championship next year by beating Georgia.


  But he was suspended for their next international game against Cyprus, nevertheless, he will have not been fit to play as he returns to his club with a swollen hamstring.


  This will come as a boost to Arsenal who now has one less player to worry about ahead of the game.

ALPHARETTA, Ga. — Police responded to a commercial burglary reported Oct. 26 at Willis Chiropractic Center, 317 N. Main St., near downtown Alpharetta.


  According to the police report, the clinic’s owner opened the office and found a wooden block 10 inches in length lying next to a shattered window in one of his treatment rooms. The window’s screen was sitting on the carpet, and the blinds were in disarray.


  Nothing was stolen or disturbed inside the clinic, otherwise. After inspecting the scene, both the victim and police determined the culprit never entered the building, the report stated. Officers found a COVID-19 mask sitting on the window sill outside and discovered two small drops of blood on a refrigerator next to the broken window. An officer collected the blood sample for testing, but evidence technicians told him Georgia Bureau of Investigations couldn’t perform DNA testing for property crimes due to costs and understaffing, the report indicated.

Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro has suffered a setback as most of the dozens of candidates he backed for municipal elections failed to secure victories or spots in runoffs.


  In more than 5,500 cities, Brazilians voted for mayors and city councilors on Sunday. The wave of political renewal that two years ago catapulted Bolsonaro to the presidency appeared to ebb in the face of well-known candidates and traditional parties, which scored the most votes in the two most populous cities. Of the nearly 60 candidates whom the leader backed, only nine advanced, according to a tally by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo.


  Bolsonaro, who is currently not affiliated with any political party, had said he would not get involved in the election campaign, but in recent weeks he turned to social media to promote a dozen candidates for mayor as well as councilor candidates.


  Bruno Carazza, a professor of economic law at Brazil’s Ibmec business school, said Bolsonaro had not made a concerted effort to rally supporters in the municipal elections and had lost an opportunity to “prepare the ground for the 2022 elections.″

Canine Corral Fundraising President Donna Amandus and others working with the new Canine Corral dog park in Rodeo Park needed volunteers Friday morning to plant trees.
 Because the Fort Madison School District went to online learning earlier that week, several Fort Madison High School students — including three from the FMHS Green Team — were able to help out and that made the project go a lot faster.
 “As luck would have it, this is one good thing to happen from the virus,” said Amandus, who also had other committee members help out, as well as others who helped trees elsewhere in Rodeo Park and down in Riverview Park two weeks ago.

 Imagine wanting to be foster parents to a child in need and then getting a call that your wish had come true. A 3-month-old-boy needed care and was ready to be brought home, but with a complication: The young child was infected with COVID-19.
 Jonathan's Place, a child-serving organization based in the Dallas area, made that call earlier this year. And the parents on the other end of the line did not hesitate, agreeing to take in the child and provide him with the love and care he needed, even at some risk to themselves.
 It was an act of heroism. In the Texas foster care system, it was also rather common. The system that serves 32,000 Texas children in foster care is filled with champions -- families who open their homes to foster a brother and sister, nonprofit caseworkers who tirelessly call around looking for apartments for newly turned 18-year-olds who would otherwise be homeless, state employees who work long hours in emotionally draining circumstances, and grandmothers taking in kids whose parents are seeking help for substance abuse or other problems.
 By the time children reach the foster care system, they have often endured severe trauma caused by abuse or neglect. In some instances, the system has failed them. A federal judge in a decade-long lawsuit has repeatedly reprimanded the state for failing to sufficiently reform the system, pointing to times when children were subjected to abusive and, at times, deadly conditions. These tragic outcomes are unacceptable.
 But Texans also need to know this state is full of dedicated, highly trained professionals and organizations committed to children, youth and families. We are working right now to fix problems in the foster care system and build on its many successes.
 The Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services (TACFS), which supports child and youth-serving organizations across the state, is enacting a comprehensive plan focused on delivering the best possible care for children and youth. We are providing more frequent and better trainings so organizations can ingrain the best practices in the field into their care. We are working to meet the individual needs of organizations by helping them strengthen their clinical approach, strategic planning and overall improvement plans.
 The key to system improvement is investing in services. We hope legislators will add funding for direct care to support the foster families and community organizations taking care of Texas kids -- funding for trainings focused on serving kids who have experienced trauma, high-quality counselors and therapists, crisis support and innovative treatment models.
 The needs are stark. The pandemic has brought conditions that often correlate with increases in abuse, from economic uncertainty to increased substance abuse. The already-challenging work of serving traumatized children and youth has become even more difficult. But these professionals are used to overcoming obstacles. And it is important for Texans to know that the system continues to work. Organizations are open and ready to love and care for children who have suffered abuse or neglect in their families.
 Going forward, community-based organizations will work with legislators, agency officials and community partners to address problems, build public confidence and provide the best care possible. We will push for reforms that build on advancements in Texas' foster care system so we can get it right for every child.
 But we are not starting from scratch. This system is full of heroes, and their resolve to love and care for children is only growing stronger.
  _Olse is chief executive officer of the Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services, a network of organizations serving children and families in Texas' foster care and child welfare systems._

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has suffered a setback as most of the dozens of candidates he backed for municipal elections failed to secure victories or spots in runoffs.


  In more than 5,500 cities, Brazilians voted for mayors and city councilors on Sunday. The wave of political renewal that two years ago catapulted Bolsonaro to the presidency appeared to ebb in the face of well-known candidates and traditional parties, which scored the most votes in the two most populous cities. Of the nearly 60 candidates whom the leader backed, only nine advanced, according to a tally by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo.


  Bolsonaro, who is currently not affiliated with any political party, had said he would not get involved in the election campaign, but in recent weeks he turned to social media to promote a dozen candidates for mayor as well as councilor candidates.


  Bruno Carazza, a professor of economic law at Brazil’s Ibmec business school, said Bolsonaro had not made a concerted effort to rally supporters in the municipal elections and had lost an opportunity to “prepare the ground for the 2022 elections.″


  The president deleted a social media post with a list of the candidates he had supported and sought to distance himself from their poor performances. Only two mayors backed by the president secured a spot in the second round.


  “My help to a few mayoral candidates was summed up by 4 live broadcasts on social media over a total of 3 hours,” he wrote.

  The court heard how the designer was thrown into the air in front of the car and tumbled like a rag doll as she was run over before Woolley smiled as they sped off.


  According to a document detailing the Board's decision, at the time of his crimes Woolley had a way of life "revolving around drugs" and mixing with like-minded people with his "core beliefs" contributing to his offending.


  His behaviour behind bars was described as "generally compliant" and he had won praise for acting as a carer for other inmates.


  But his probation officer warned he needed more psychological counselling in custody before he "could be considered fully safe" to release.

When I drop my hands down to my waist, as I often do in VR, the tracking struggles to stay consistent. How do I know if I can't see for myself? Lots of VR games, like Pixel Reef's sensational Paper Beast, emit a persistent laser- pointer from the controllers and, when I'm playing games with that feature, the line is regularly off by a fair few degrees. Even in Beat Saber itself I would notice my sabers going off at angles at the bottom of a swing, even if that wasn't enough to ever mess up a move (though I can't process Expert+ nearly enough to tell you what the impact is there). The controllers also struggle when up close, causing issues with mechanics like archery and boxing, and occlusion for two-handed weapons can be spotty.

Where Moderna really seems to have a leg up is on the distribution front. Should Moderna get Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States, as well as the green light elsewhere, it will likely be easier to store than Pfizer's vaccine, which requires ultra-cold freezers to maintain stability. Moderna's candidate, meanwhile, "can be distributed using existing cold-chain shipping and storage infrastructure," Reuters reports, and can remain stable in a regular refrigerator for as long as 30 days, exceeding expectations.

Councillors voted to borrow £17m to fund the project in 2017.


  The hotel off Church Road is owned by the council and run by industry giant Interstate.


  A brand franchise agreement between the authority and the worldwide Hilton hotels chain sees it bear the well-known Hampton by Hilton name.


  Ahead of its opening last year, council chiefs said experts had told them occupancy rates of more than 80% would generate “healthy annual profits” for the authority - with “significantly lower rates” still seeing the council break even.


  Leaders are banking on an annual income of £250,000 from the hotel to help fund services over the next 30 years.


  And the council says occupancy levels are “far exceeding” that of most hotels across the country - with the latest cabinet report stating it is “performing very well” when compared to competitors.


  However, council accounts for 2019/20 show that more than £2m was sliced off an independent valuation of the hotel over the course of 12 months.


  And there are still doubts over whether it will deliver the income promised.

The Spanish government says it plans to increase aid for Africa while speeding up deportations of those who don’t meet the criteria to stay in Europe and funding police operations against people traffickers in Morocco, Mauritania and Senegal, the northwestern African countries that are the main points of departure for migrants bound for the Canaries.


  Several makeshift military camps have also been prepared to host migrants who are crammed at the Arguineguin dock, and Interior Minister Fernando Grande- Marlaska said Monday that the transfers would be initiated “soon.”


  Interviewed on Antena 3 Television, Grande-Marlaska said that the makeshift camps were only for the first 72 hours when the migrants are in police custody while deciding whether they meet the criteria to stay, and rejected the idea of turning the Canary Islands into Europe’s “new Lesbos,” in reference to the Greek island infamously known for its refugee camps.


  The new migrant focus on the perilous Canary Islands route, first seen in 2006, has come as authorities crack down on previously popular passages across the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa to European Union countries.

Imagine wanting to be foster parents to a child in need and then getting a call that your wish had come true. A 3-month-old-boy needed care and was ready to be brought home, but with a complication: The young child was infected with COVID-19.
   
 Jonathan's Place, a child-serving organization based in the Dallas area, made that call earlier this year. And the parents on the other end of the line did not hesitate, agreeing to take in the child and provide him with the love and care he needed, even at some risk to themselves.
   
 It was an act of heroism. In the Texas foster care system, it was also rather common. The system that serves 32,000 Texas children in foster care is filled with champions -- families who open their homes to foster a brother and sister, nonprofit caseworkers who tirelessly call around looking for apartments for newly turned 18-year-olds who would otherwise be homeless, state employees who work long hours in emotionally draining circumstances, and grandmothers taking in kids whose parents are seeking help for substance abuse or other problems.
   
 By the time children reach the foster care system, they have often endured severe trauma caused by abuse or neglect. In some instances, the system has failed them. A federal judge in a decade-long lawsuit has repeatedly reprimanded the state for failing to sufficiently reform the system, pointing to times when children were subjected to abusive and, at times, deadly conditions. These tragic outcomes are unacceptable.
   
 But Texans also need to know this state is full of dedicated, highly trained professionals and organizations committed to children, youth and families. We are working right now to fix problems in the foster care system and build on its many successes.
   
 The Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services (TACFS), which supports child and youth-serving organizations across the state, is enacting a comprehensive plan focused on delivering the best possible care for children and youth. We are providing more frequent and better trainings so organizations can ingrain the best practices in the field into their care. We are working to meet the individual needs of organizations by helping them strengthen their clinical approach, strategic planning and overall improvement plans.
   
 The key to system improvement is investing in services. We hope legislators will add funding for direct care to support the foster families and community organizations taking care of Texas kids -- funding for trainings focused on serving kids who have experienced trauma, high-quality counselors and therapists, crisis support and innovative treatment models.
   
 The needs are stark. The pandemic has brought conditions that often correlate with increases in abuse, from economic uncertainty to increased substance abuse. The already-challenging work of serving traumatized children and youth has become even more difficult. But these professionals are used to overcoming obstacles. And it is important for Texans to know that the system continues to work. Organizations are open and ready to love and care for children who have suffered abuse or neglect in their families.
   
 Going forward, community-based organizations will work with legislators, agency officials and community partners to address problems, build public confidence and provide the best care possible. We will push for reforms that build on advancements in Texas' foster care system so we can get it right for every child.
   
 But we are not starting from scratch. This system is full of heroes, and their resolve to love and care for children is only growing stronger.
   
 Olse is chief executive officer of the Texas Alliance of Child and Family Services, a network of organizations serving children and families in Texas' foster care and child welfare systems.

Will’s shock at Lyra’s daemon Pan – essentially the external manifestation of her soul – is just as astounding as Lyra’s discovery of Will cooking omelets. The latter leading to a hilarious sequence of Lyra trying to duplicate Will’s culinary skill. As Will takes Lyra back through his portal to our world a few times, there are more of these funny beats to be found in season two – while this is still very much a fantasy drama rather than a light adventure, it’s not as morosely self-serious as season one. This gives Keen and Amir Wilson a lot greater range to play, especially Keen who gets to truly cut loose emotionally later on.

I myself haven't tried out the original Reverb for comparison but, stacked up to other VR headsets in 2020, Reverb's display still strikes me as remarkably sharp. If you're still using 2016 - early 2019-era PC headsets then the difference is night and day; Reverb G2 is like a breath of fresh air… for your eyes. Tiny details that I've simply learned not to expect from the visual VR experience, like telling individual blades of grass apart or seeing the whites of a character's eyes from a distance suddenly become visible, creating more textured, believable virtual worlds as a result. Even if you've grown accustomed to either Index (1440 x 1600 per eye) or Quest 2's resolutions like I have, Reverb G2 boasts a very noticeable upper hand in this department.

Last Monday (Nov. 9), "value" stocks within the traded equity markets outpaced their "growth" counterparts by the widest margin for any single day in nearly a century. The next day saw more of the same. Investors dumped out of fast-growing technology holdings in favor of companies negatively impacted by the coronavirus outbreak for the third-largest value beat since the 1930s. There have only been two comparable rotations in history (1975, 2000), and both led to greater market shifts towards value equities, so it's reasonable to wonder how sports-centric SPACs would be impacted if history repeats itself. Conversations with several SPAC insiders indicated if investors are going to prioritize value companies over growth companies, SPACs will eventually follow suit.

COVID-19 infections in the United States are skyrocketing to new heights, crossing the 1,50,000 mark.


  1,53,861 new cases recorded in the last 24 hours was the worst daily toll in the country since the pandemic began.


  With this, the country's total number of COVID-19 infections increased to 10554804, as per latest data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.


  630 new deaths in the same period took the total casualties to 242430.


  Since the beginning of this month, cases are multiplying in the United States, breaking all-time records day-by-day.


  Twenty seven states this week hit a record for the number of new cases reported.


  New COVID cases in the U.S. rose by nearly 150 percent within the last 30 days, and by 100 percent since the beginning of this month. The nation is also posting new records for hospitalizations nearly every day, and healthcare systems are reaching capacity in many areas where cases have spiked.


  One in 378 US residents tested positive for COVID-19 this week, and hospitalizations have nearly doubled in the past two weeks, according to the Covid Tracking Project.       ---       The seven-day average of deaths now exceeds 1,000 per day, a level not seen since the summer surge. States reported another 7,382 lives lost to COVID-19 in the past week, as per the latest data published by the U.S. collaborative volunteer-run effort to track the pandemic.


  On Thursday, California became the second U.S. state to top 1 million Covid-19 cases. With a total of 1,006,099 cases, they are only behind Texas in this regard.


  In the wake of the alarming trend, some schools are moving back to online classes.


  Meanwhile, President-elect Joe Biden spoke with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer regarding the urgent need for the Congress to come together in the lame duck session on a bipartisan basis to pass a bill that provides resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.


  They also discussed relief for working families and small businesses, support for state and local governments trying to keep frontline workers on the payroll, expanded unemployment insurance, and affordable health care for millions of families, the Joe Biden Transition team said in a press release.


  Germany recorded more than 23,000 coronavirus infections, its highest toll in a single day on Thursday. On the same day, Russia reported new daily record of 21,983 cases.

Normally, any jurisdiction that enters the International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG) has a one-year observation period to work with FATF’s regional organ to address deficiencies before public identification and formal review by the FATF. In Pakistan’s case, the FATF informed Pakistan about strategic deficiencies and their consequences in 2016 and the same were duly communicated to Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) by the civil Government. We were supposed to overcome those deficiencies by 2017 so that we could avoid being named as a non-cooperative state. Unfortunately, our civil and military leaders were not on the same page and their internal conflicts exposed this embarrassment which we collectively experienced as a nation.

SpaceX and NASA have created history in space exploration. The SpaceX Crew Dragon spaceship finally took flight on Sunday from Cape Canaveral, with four astronauts to embark on a journey to the International Space Station (ISS). The team includes Mike Hopkins, Shannon Walker, and Victor Glover of NASA, accompanied by Soichi Noguchi of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency. Were honored to have you as our crew as we begin operational missions to the ISS. Have an amazing trip, and know that we are all for one, said SpaceXs mission controller Jay Aranha.The mission was scheduled for Saturday but the weather forced the space agency to further delay the launch by 24 hours. This is SpaceXs second flight with astronauts aboard, the first being an experimental one carrying astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS. The latest Crew-1 mission is said to be docked at the ISS for six months which would also be another one for the record books. It will be the longest human spaceflight that took off from the US.We are ready for the six months of work that is waiting for us on board the International Space Station, and we are ready for the return, said astronaut Mike Hopkins before the take-off.NASA has invested around $3 billion in the Crew Dragons development and SpaceX engineers were responsible for the designing and testing as per the agencys requirements. SpaceX has been in collaboration with NASA for resupply missions to ISS since 2012. SpaceX is also scheduled to launch two types of Dragon spacecraft seven times in the coming 14 months.Besides, SpaceX is also working on its Starship launch. If everything goes according to Elon Musks plan, SpaceX will begin Starship launches by mid-2020s and will later colonize Mars by the 2030s.

However, the authority of this document is questionable because its underlying regulation is no longer in effect, having been replaced in 2007 by the PRC Labor Law and other relevant laws and regulations.

As for CBD, it doesn’t give you the same effect as actual THC but rather used for relief of anxiety, depression or any stress.

"The Senate could actually pass a bill that gives Americans some confidence that they would have economic support, get the extra $600 in unemployment benefits running again, make sure that people understand that they could feed their kids and pay their rent if we have in some areas of the country to restrict activities. And they have the ability to step up to their president and say, 'You need to act differently, you must acknowledge the election and conduct a smooth transition,'" she said.

But the best optics and audio in the world aren't worth much good if you get the fundamentals wrong and, for some, this will be Reverb G2's downfall. The inside-out tracking on the _headset_ is quite good; many people thought two- camera inside out tracking didn't make the grade with the original Windows MR headsets and Facebook's Oculus Insight tracking has, quite frankly, spoiled our expectations a little on this front. But, by adding two more cameras, the Reverb G2 headset itself hasn't put a foot wrong in all of my testing so far, which has included throwing myself to the floor to start sneaking in Skyrim and leaning in for close inspection of Google Earth's tiny toy model-like landscapes.

John "Johnny" Robert Christensen, Jr. died unexpectedly Thursday, November 12, 2020 at his home. John's life began 48 years prior in Auburndale, Wisconsin, where he was born to John and Patricia Christensen on April 21, 1972. John was the loved son of three boys and was known as "smiley" by his Grandma Annie. He always loved fishing with his family when he was a kid.      John married Melissa (Miller) Christensen on December 28, 2002. She preceded him in death on October 2, 2010. John is survived by his children Katie and Henry Christensen.      After Melissa's passing, John dedicated his heart and soul to his kids overcoming odds to raise them in love and kindness. Katie and Henry love their dad to the moon and back. To Henry, his dad was his superhero. Katie says that one phrase she would use to describe her dad would be "Never a dull moment! My dad was my best friend in life and the person I would go to for everything. I love him with all my heart, and I will miss him."      John graduated Auburndale High School in1990 and dedicated his professional career to serving others while maintaining facilities for Figi's and Nelson- Jameson in Marshfield. He is remembered by his fellow teammates as a dedicated servant and they enjoyed lots of laughter with him every day.   In addition to his parents and children, John is survived by his brothers Brian (Sue) Christensen of Auburndale and Tony (Stephanie) Christensen of Stratford. Katie and Henry are further survived by Melissa's family in Missouri including grandfather Jerry Miller, aunt Tammy (Richard) Anderson, and uncle Dr. Greg (Carrie) Miller.      John is further survived by aunts, uncles, cousins, and numerous friends who loved laughing with him while he always had that smirk on his face. He will be missed and will be remembered for hislarger-than-life presence wherever he went.      A celebration of John's life will be held at a later date.      The family requests any donation in lieu of flowers be dedicated to a fund set up to care for the children; Katie and HenryCare Fund (Tony Christensen) c/o Forward Bank, 1001 N Central Ave, Marshfield, WI 54449.

Honestly, this doesn’t look too bad. It's clear that the film made use of the vast open desert and numerous car scenes to make the most of the different regulations in place, but the result doesn’t look too gimmicky at all. Thanks to stars Gillian White, Mickey Rourke, and Michael Jai White, the performances come across decently enough. The story might be rather cliched, following a woman (White) who will stop at nothing to recover her kidnapped daughter from a human trafficking boss (Rourke), but with solid execution and good tension, it should be worth watching.

What if you had to marry a spouse after only hearing their voice?
   
 Sounds like reality television, but that's essentially what is being asked of prospective student-athletes for the foreseeable future.
   
 The NCAA Oversight Committee has recommended the football recruiting dead period be extended until April 15 due to safety concerns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   
 That means high school athletes haven't been able to take official visits or talk to coaches in person for an entire year.
   
 It makes for a process that for some already wasn't an easy decision even more difficult.
   
 Young people are being asked to make family-shaping and life-changing decisions without having seen or touched the place where their future will be shaped.
   
 "These are extremely difficult times for everyone right now," Brad Johnson, former NFL quarterback and father of Oconee County High School tight end Jake Johnson, said in a text message to the Athens Banner-Herald. "These are tough decisions for kids and parents to make on choosing a school for playing potential and academics. Thank goodness for virtual zoom meetings of what school facilities look like and to get to know your potential coach. But to imagine picking a school without ever seeing it in person or shaking the hand of a coach in person who you are giving your son or daughter to is silly. I wish in January they would at least let you walk on campus with a mask after taking a COVID-19 test on campus of the school you are visiting to help make one of the most important decisions of your life."
   
 The dead period extension could have ripple effects throughout the future of college football.
   
 Virtual recruitment here to stay?
   
 In the absence of in-person visits recruits have been wooed via teleconference or video conference calls. The process is one of necessity with COVID-19 cases rising again in nearly every region of the country.
   
 The virtual recruitment has served its purpose, though some recruits point out challenges associated with the approach.
   
 "You still get the experience to see not only the locker rooms, the campuses, the classrooms and you also get to see what the atmosphere around campus is," Athens Academy junior Johnerio Holt said. "It's ineffective in that you want to see it in person. You want to live that lifestyle for a second. Just to be able to see what it's like to be on that campus and be around those people and be with those college athletes … I prefer speaking in person. I can show who I am and my joyful expression. I try my hardest to give that same energy not only online, but also over the phone."
   
 Where recruits themselves may adjust over time to the virtual nature that recruiting has taken, parents of prospective athletes may be more affected by the lack of engagement with the campus where they are poised to send their children.
   
 "These kids are resilient," said Verron Haynes, former UGA player and father of four-star running back Justice Haynes. "It's us, the parents that kind of need that tutorial and that engagement with the campus and the new way of doing things. I see Justice on the phone more each day and can't put it down. It's the parents that need that good feel. Fortunately, for guys that have played and whose parents who have played, they're familiar with the process."
   
 An understanding of the geographic location of a school could also be a big factor moving forward.
   
 "Knowing geographically where the campus is will play an important role because the Zoom call to a school up north in December you really can't feel how cold that is," Haynes said with a laugh. "That is where some people are going to get slighted a little bit. They're projecting this nice atmosphere of this Zoom call but outside there's 20 inches of snow. Geographically you've got to know where you're talking to those coaches and that university."
   
 Old school recruiting making a comeback?
   
 Clarke Central football coach Dave Perno reflected on the recruitment of former Gladiators standout Dunta Robinson.
   
 Robinson was a late add to the South Carolina recruiting class before becoming a first-round selection in the NFL Draft and spending 10 years in the league.
   
 Robinson didn't sign with the Gamecocks until late spring of his senior year.
   
 "It was May or April of his senior year," Perno said. "They drove up to South Carolina and fortunately for South Carolina, they gave him a chance. They're out there. It is what it is. It's kind of old school recruiting now. Guys are going to have to dig in and make up the ground and see what they come up with."
   
 With the dead period being extended into the spring at the earliest, Perno fears for players still trying to make an impression on college coaches.
   
 Previously coach of UGA's baseball team, Perno says he preferred meeting recruits in person. He watched video but, he wanted to see more.
   
 Perno wanted to know how a player acted around teammates and what happened when a player failed. Those interactions and conversations broke a lot of ties.
   
 "I worry that a lot of schools are going to go off the information that they had instead of really digging in because they can't right now," Perno said. "I think the sitting down with a kid was the part that was always the difference maker for me. If you had two kids on the bubble it was the conversation that broke the tie. These (holds up a phone) have killed that with this generation. You've got to be able to communicate. You've got to be able to look people in the eye and express what you're feeling and articulate your opinions. I think that really helps sell you as a prospect."
   
 Transfer market set to explode?
   
 The transfer portal was already a hot ticket in college football. There could be an uptick coming with a potential free transfer in the works due to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the influx of recruits grappling to decide to live in a place they've never seen in person before.
   
 There's opinions on both sides about whether the current transfer portal is good for college sports, but new rules regarding transfers amid the current climate could make sense.
   
 It's forcing the old school and new school to combine mindsets for a common ground.
   
 "It's a Pandora's box still," Perno said. "In one aspect, Justin Fields is a kid you can't let get out of town. All you have to do is watch him play one time. He's a great football player. Probably one of the best in the country. That side of it, I'm not for the transfer rule, but at the same time, this kid needed to shine. He needed a shot. Its stories like that, that make it tough. Coaches have to do a good job in making sure these kids are getting treated right and treated fair and you're being honest."

EDITORIAL: Outgoing US President Donald Trump refuses to concede defeat despite his rival Joe Biden having clinched enough states to give him a very comfortable majority of the electoral college votes even before the remaining votes are finally counted. Instead, he has embarked on a stubborn strategy of challenging the almost universal conclusion that he has lost. Amongst the actions the seemingly petulant Trump plans are public rallies to support the legal challenges he intends to launch on the basis of unsubstantiated claims that the election was not fair and he has not lost it (at least yet). While going against the traditions of democracy and the US’s culture of losing gracefully, Trump is living up to his reputation of being a mean, petty and revengeful person. It seems he intends to use the time remaining till his final departure on January 20, 2021 to wreak vengeance at home and abroad. Domestically, the first victim of Trump’s belated wrath is Defence Secretary Mark Esper, the fourth defence secretary in Trump’s four year tenure. This action smacks of Trump settling scores within his own administration. Trump and Esper fell out publicly over the former’s desire to use the military against protests launched throughout the country against the police killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis and Esper’s stalling on Trump’s desire for a rapid withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan. Trump named Christopher Miller, Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, as acting secretary of defence, although it is highly unlikely the Senate will confirm him or any other nomination by Trump in his twilight days. Informed US observers have termed Trump’s action ‘childish, reckless’, considering the implications of rendering the defence secretary’s post a lame duck in the middle of global security challenges. Trump has also departed from the tradition of easing the transition of power to the new president. For all intents and purposes, the transition is on hold. Voices of dissent at this churlish behaviour are beginning to be heard from within Trump’s inner circle, including his wife Melania (who reportedly has a keen interest in Trump leaving office soon so that she can divorce him) and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Many amongst this circle believe Trump’s slipshod legal challenges will peter out without evidence. None, however, believe he will agree to leave office in January 2021, which could trigger a constitutional crisis. Nevertheless, Trump’s obstructionism in the face of the truth that he has lost and his vengeful parting kicks to former colleagues cannot but leave a bitter taste in their wake.
