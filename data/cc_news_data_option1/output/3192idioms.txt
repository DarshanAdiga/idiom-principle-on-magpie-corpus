"It's not only us, it's everything right now," Schenn said. "I think if we went back on Vancouver's playoff series against Minnesota, they had 28 power plays in four games. So they're calling a lot of penalties and that's on us to keep your stick to yourself and move your legs and check with your legs rather than your stick. Penalties are going to happen. At the end of the day, it is what it is, there's no sense in complaining about it now. We'll find a way to be better in Game 2. You're going to get power plays and you're going to have to kill off some penalties, and it's going to be like that all series."

The two games in Buffalo might suggest that there's a jetstream in the ballpark which, along with the win, could be enough to give the Marlins' plane home a good push forward after squandering a big lead.

Wood County Common Pleas Judge Alan Mayberry on Tuesday handed down the prison sentence, starting immediately, along with the order for restitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Defense attorney Abbey Flynn asked for a stay, pending an appeal, which Mayberry denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                  She then asked for a restitution hearing, which the judge also denied.                                                                                                                                                                                                  In June 2019, Gretchen Nye approach police with a complaint that Richard Nye, who was not supposed to have access to any of her bank accounts, had taken $12,000 from her savings account.                                                                                                                                                                                                  During a jury trial in June, Nye was found guilty. At another trial that month, he was found not guilty of intimidation and retaliation against his ex-wife and her boyfriend.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mayberry presided over both trials, as well as Nye’s recent indictment for money laundering, two counts receiving stolen property, two counts possessing criminal tools, and engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, a first-degree felony.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Flynn said she has known Nye for a long time, and he has adhered to all his court appearances. He has had no criminal convictions since 1999, when “at that time he was at a different place in life.”                                                                                                                                                                                                  She asked for community control and restitution.                                                                                                                                                                                                  If he is allowed to remain in the community, he can earn back the money owed through his full-time employment, Flynn said.

She is a single mom who picks up extra hours to earn the income for her diabetic son’s medicine and allow both her kids to play travel sports.                                                                                                                                                                                                  She said she borrowed the money from her retirement fund to make repairs to her home, where she has lived for 16 years. She was going to use the money to replace the roof and repair the plumbing in the bathroom.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “I had people lined up to fix both things when Rick stole the money from me,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Now she is making monthly payments of $343 on a loan she never used.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “You literally stole the roof from over their heads and the floor from under their feet,” she said to her ex-husband. “You never think about things like this, you never did. … You never thought about your kids, you only thought about yourself.”                                                                                                                                                                                                  Both of her children are ashamed of him, she said, and have no desire to see him and in fact haven’t for the last 14 months.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “They feel you chose money over them,” Gretchen Nye said.

NASA warns of upcoming close shave with asteroid as doomsday preacher predicts 'apocalyptic fireball'

With a strong summer rebound almost in the record books, local real-estate professionals expect pent-up demand could carry through much of the rest of the year across Northern Virginia.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “Top-producing agents project that the typical lull in September won’t occur this year since the market is making up for the pause that took place in April and May,” said Ryan Conrad, CEO of the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors (NVAR), in parsing recently released July sales data.                                                                                                                                                                                                  For the month, 2,376 homes went to closing – up 6.5 percent from a year before – but inventory concerns continue to keep prices high and properties moving quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “It continues to be a seller’s market in Northern Virginia,” said Nicholas Lagos, president of NVAR, who pointed to declining mortgage-interest rates as another boost to demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Perhaps the situation is no surprise, as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government-mandated shutdown hobbled real-estate activity throughout the spring. The market now seems to be making up for lost time.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “The traditional spring market has been delayed to the summer months, and the pent-up buyer and seller demand that began in in late spring continued full force into July,” Lagos said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Year-over-year sales were up across the region’s major jurisdictions – Arlington and Fairfax counties and the city of Alexandria – by rates ranging from 4.5 percent to 19.2 percent. In the two smaller communities of the survey, sales bumped up significantly in the city of Falls Church but were down slightly in the city of Fairfax.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Average sales prices were up across the board, with the average home selling for $696,902 across Northern Virginia, an increase of 12.6 percent from a year before. The average includes all types of housing, including single-family, townhouses and condominiums.                                                                                                                                                                                                  New listings continued an upward trend that began in June, when new listings of homes coming to market in Northern Virginia were positive for the first time since February. The number of new listings increased 14.5 percent from June 2020 to July 2020, indicating that sellers are feeling increasingly confident in local market and economic conditions – and might be desiring to cash in.                                                                                                                                                                                                  New listings in July were up more than 30 percent from a year before, but the overall tight inventory is still a challenge for prospective purchasers.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “Properly priced homes continue to sell quickly and often at, or above, list price,” Lagos said.

"It's been an insular community for so long, by necessity," said Earl Hilton, the athletic director at North Carolina A&T. "These are places of retreat, places of sanctuary, places of protection. There's a feeling that we are in a safe place where we can celebrate and enjoy and appreciate each other in ways that are genuine and authentic."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Not this year. There's no football, no homecoming, no chance to watch the school's famed band perform one of its dazzling halftime shows.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "The leaves change, it gets a little cooler, and it's just what you do on a Saturday afternoon," mused Hilton, sadness clear in his voice. "I'm at a loss for words to describe what it's going to be like."                                                                                                                                                                                                  For a country already in the midst of a devastating economic downturn, the loss of college football will have a crushing impact on bars, restaurants and other businesses that rely on football fans.                                                                                                                                                                                                  That is especially true of college towns like Oxford, Mississippi and Clemson, South Carolina and State College, Pennsylvania.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I was talking to a restaurant owner here in Oxford who said 50 percent of his yearly profit comes from college football season," said Wilson, the Ole Miss professor. "Even if people are able to come back next year, it won't be the same. Some of the restaurants they loved won't be here. Some of the clothing stores, some of the bars, they won't be here."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Oxford has a a tax base of about 25,000 residents, and the population grows closer to 60,000 when classes are in session.                                                                                                                                                                                                  But on a big football weekend, the town can be swamped by nearly 200,000 people. Those people spend money, lots of money. About a third of Oxford's operating budget comes from sales taxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "We count on those six to seven weekends a year," Mayor Robyn Tannehill said. "There are businesses in this town that can weather a slow winter or spring because because they know football's coming."                                                                                                                                                                                                  The SEC has already cut back on its normal 12-game schedule, hoping the league can complete that a 10-game slate of conference games. Even the games that are played will surely be in stadiums that are empty or let in only a fraction of their normal capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                  The universities will likely crack down on popular tailgating spots such as The Grove.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "The Grove, the weather, the tailgating, the feel of a big Saturday morning game day," Tannehill said. "I can't imagine Oxford without it."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Even in a larger city such as Columbus, the loss of a Buckeyes season is a huge blow to a sports bar such as the Varsity Club, which opened in 1959 about two blocks from Ohio Stadium.                                                                                                                                                                                                  On a football Saturday, the place is overrun with crowds that spill out the door before the game, during the game and long into the night.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Those are eight massive days a year for us," said R.J. Oberle, a manager at the Varsity Club. "We really thrive on those events."

The warm, moist air rises very quickly - like a hot air balloon - and can be moving as fast as 30 to 40 miles per hour. The air also holds much more moisture than winter clouds - up to five times as much.

"My position is clear. I'm here through to the last day of our agreement and I'll give everything I have for this club," Ozil told _The Athletic_. "Situations like these will never break me, they only make me stronger. I showed in the past that I can come back into the team and I will show it again."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Regarding reports Arsenal was contemplating buying Ozil out of the last year of his contract, he said: "I'll decide when I go, not other people. I didn't sign for two or three years, I signed for four and that should be respected by everyone."                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ozil's latest deal was a three-and-a-half-year agreement announced in February 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Things have obviously been difficult but I love Arsenal, I love to work there, I love the people in the club - the real people, those I've been with for a long time - and I love London, it's my home," he said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ozil claims he could have earned "far more money" as a free agent but had agreed to extend his Arsenal contract because of his commitment to the club, saying that head coach Mikel Arteta "knows my quality".                                                                                                                                                                                                  "I'm not going into pre-season thinking, 'Final year, I can chill - I know I don't play'," he said. "These are not easy times for Arsenal and I want to help. I still have a lot to offer and I train as hard as I can, whether I'm in the squad or not."

Day added: "I'm sure there will be a lot of back and forth here, but … starting the first week of January would be the best week to go, an eight-week season. That way there is some separation between that season and the next season. We get some midyear guys to come in and possibly play a two-for-one, they'd get two seasons in in one calendar year, which I think the recruits would be really excited about.

The emergency room MRI discloses a massive brain hemorrhage, and he crosses the frontiers of eternity in Veronica’s loving arms. Fate thus awards him the “kiss of death” he wished for himself all his life.

The additional funding by the CARES Act grant will also allow CRD to support grant applications by local governments and other governmental partners to address the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.                                                                                                                                                                                                  “Our local communities are navigating never-before-seen challenges due to COVID-19,” said Russell W. Mills, senior director of the Center for Regional Development. “This funding is critical in allowing CRD to bring additional staff capacity and expertise on board to expand our reach and support northwest Ohio.”

Isidro Andrade-Tafolla, who was with his wife, said agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement followed him out of the courthouse in Hillsboro after he attended a hearing in a driving under the influence of intoxicants case, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported.

Great news! We made the national news on NBC and Telemundo, with CNN coming soon. You may have seen it last week. These networks, and some local affiliates as well, covered our recently initiated COVID mobile field testing clinic for farmworkers, as ours was the first of its kind in the nation. They came out to a vineyard near McFarland to talk to some farmworkers in the field about COVID, and the need for testing, and how hard it has been, until now, for farmworkers to get tested. My District 4 staff had worked closely with Good Samaritan Hospital (GSH) and California Farmworkers Foundation (CFF) to set up a mobile testing clinic in the field, and NBC and Telemundo wanted to take a look.
 Special thanks to our partners, GSH and CFF, for doing the lion’s share of the work to make this program successful. Each day CFF coordinates with the local growers to make sure their employees are available and to identify a field location. This makes it convenient for farmworkers and farmers alike to get tested without disruption to their work schedules. Each day, GSH takes their clinic into the field to test these workers. They staff their clinic with medical professionals, provide the supplies, and make sure a doctor looks over the process. The District 4 office plays a role too, as we facilitated the planning and make sure we take advantage of available CARES Act funding to reimburse GSH for costs. We also work to ensure this mobile clinic goes to communities like Buttonwillow, which doesn't have a testing site of its own but have plenty of farmworkers who need testing. It’s the kind of partnership I love, where we connect our community partners who want to serve the community with those in the community who need to be helped. It was satisfying that these national media outlets thought our local program worthy of that kind of attention. Satisfying because they recognized, as we do, how much we need our farmworkers, and how much it seems their importance does not get the recognition they deserve.
 We eat, because they work, and especially in this time of crisis they keep working, despite the dangers to themselves and their families. That was why it was so important to bring testing to them, which we have done, so that they can keep working and protect their families and so that we all can have some confidence that they are safe while they are working.
 The mobile clinic truly is mobile. Two weeks ago, we were scheduled to be near McFarland, Delano and Lamont. This past week we added Lost Hills to our communities. This coming week, we’ll be in Arvin and Delano again, with Buttonwillow to follow. If you’ve seen them in your travels, it’s pretty simple – a couple of canopies, a couple of medical assistants, some supplies, and an organized procession of farmworkers getting tested.
 It wasn’t rocket science. We simply found a way to test our essential farmworker community, and that seemed to be the thing that made this story a national headline. It may seem surprising that the media would be so interested in this story with all the other things going on in our world, but these are the real news stories that need to be told. We grow weary of politics and bad news and fake news. I’m so glad the national media found it newsworthy to tell the story of our farmworkers and how working together with great partners, we were able to get these important people tested.
 Special thanks to Kelly Gladden from GSH and all the amazing Good Sam people and Hernan Hernandez from California Farmworkers Foundation and their incredible staff for making this program work. Got any questions? Feel free to call our office at 661-868-3680 or email us at district4@kerncounty.com. Have a safe week.

JERUSALÉN (AP) — Israel realizó con éxito una prueba de su nuevo sistema de defensa contra misiles balísticos de largo alcance, informó el jueves el Ministerio de Defensa del país. El ministro de Defensa, Benny Gantz, declaró que el éxito del sistema interceptor Arrow-2 es parte de la iniciativa del país “de asegurarnos de que siempre estemos un paso delante de nuestros enemigos” en cuanto a tecnología. La prueba se realizó en el centro de Israel en horas de la noche, en un ensayo juntamente con la Agencia de Misiles de Defensa estadounidense. Arrow-2 es parte de un sistema multiplataforma que Israel ha desarrollado para defenderse de misiles de corto y mediano alcance disparados desde Gaza o Líbano, o incluso desde Irán. Incluye la Cúpula de Hierro, la Honda de David y el sistema Arrow-3 que es capaz de defender al país de misiles estratosféricos. Israel y Estados Unidos realizaron con éxito el año pasado en Alaska el sistema Arrow-3. Esa red fue desarrollada por las Industrias Aeroespaciales Israelíes y la empresa estadounidense Boeing y comenzó a funcionar en enero de 2017. El Arrow-2 ha estado en funcionamiento desde antes, y en años recientes se lo ha utilizado para repeler misiles desde Siria. El sistema antimisiles israelí está diseñado para futuras guerras previstas como un ataque masivo de misiles contra todo el territorio nacional. El sistema Arrow es capaz de interceptar misiles de muy largo alcance, incluso provenientes de la estratósfera. Moshe Patel, director de los programas antimisiles del Ministerio de Defensa, expresó que Irán es la amenaza más obvia pero que el Arrow es capaz de interceptar misiles desde Irak, Siria y otras tierras.

Atalanta looked to have done enough to survive PSG's second-half pressure until Thomas Tuchel's side scored twice in 149 seconds to reach the semi-finals of the competition for the first time in 25 years.                                                                                                                                                                                  Choupo-Moting, who was relegated from the Premier League with Stoke City two years ago, revealed he told himself to go on and make the difference after replacing Mauro Icardi in the 79th minute.                                                                                                                                                                                  "It was a crazy game, a tough game and opponents," he told UEFA.com. "I think we showed until the last moment that we believed in ourselves. It wasn't easy because we had some good occasions [chances] that, unfortunately, we couldn't score.                                                                                                                                                                                  "When I came on, I thought to myself, 'We can't lose, we can't go home like that'. I was confident in myself, confident in the team and then the rest is the history of Paris. We had a good feeling in the team. We're enjoying good moments on and off the pitch."                                                                                                                                                                                  PSG have already completed the quadruple of Ligue 1, Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue and Trophee des Champions this season, but Choupo-Moting admitted the Champions League is their top priority.                                                                                                                                                                                  "We've already won four titles this season but the most important is this one," he said. "We really believe in ourselves and we did it today.                                                                                                                                                                                  "Everybody knows we have top-quality individuals, but we wanted to show it also as a team. It's a big step today against a very good opponent. Respect to Atalanta, but I'm very happy we did it."                                                                                                                                                                                  PSG will face either RB Leipzig or Atletico Madrid in the semi-finals.

The No. 8 seed in the Western Conference won't be determined Thursday, with the four teams still capable of claiming the berth jockeying for a bid to a two-team play-in tournament. In other words, two teams will be eliminated by the end of the night and two teams will advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Making the playoffs would mean something slightly different for the squads still in contention. The Spurs are trying to extend their postseason streak to 23 years. The Trail Blazers are trying not to squander another year of Damian Lillard's prime. The Grizzlies are trying to gain valuable experience for their young core. The Suns want to end a 10-year drought.

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- The city of Lebanon, New Hampshire, is the latest community to pass an ordinance requiring people to wear face masks in businesses, government buildings and other public indoor spaces during the coronavirus pandemic.

Organizers say in a statement: "It is a decision that makes us emotional because it also represents a green light for the restart of world sport finally in front of the fans."

A contact tracing app has been recently developed by the health ministry, but the regional governments of Madrid and Barcelona appear to have underestimated the need to contract more contact tracers to keep tabs on cases.

Day told reporters he believed there was a major difference between playing in the winter and playing in the fall again, and playing in the spring and playing in the fall, according to the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. He added that he hopes a plan by the Big Ten can get drawn up quickly with the hope of NFL talent like Justin Fields and Shaun Wade being persuaded to play instead of jumping into draft-prep mode.

Americans may choose to dig deeper this time around. Some state legislators, for example, are attempting to leverage this moment to create more systemic changes beyond policing - in schools, judicial systems and health matters.

So far, there is no word on the performance specifications, but it wouldn't be too far off the target to assume that the new electric motor will have similar performance as the 125 cc engine of the CB125R which makes around 13 bhp of power and has a top speed of 130 kmph. The electric version is likely to have a similar top speed, but likely to have quicker acceleration and higher torque figures. Considering the fact that the bodywork, chassis and suspension is already available in production, the development of the new electric motorcycle will not require a complete 'build from scratch' production cycle.

Those who have switched to a true Vegan diet can vouch for its wonders, from making the skin come alive and the hair shine to fighting against inflammations, boosting immunity and a myriad other health benefits. The vitamins, minerals and other important chemicals like phytonutrients and anti- oxidants are available in plenty to vegan eaters. On the other hand, they also avoid consuming potentially harmful animal fats connected to several ailments such as heart diseases, diabetes, hypertension or rheumatoid arthritis, as well as cancer.

The Old McDonald County Jail is the oldest remaining jail. It replaced a log building with the only access through the roof which burned in 1888. Until 1904, when the old jail was built, no jail facility existed in the county and prisoners were transported to other communities including Neosho. Today, the building is used to store county records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The jail was built after voters approved a bond issue for a new jail in November 1902 and it was completed in July, 1904. A total of 18 sheriffs used the jail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     THe old jail is located at 200 East Third Street in Pineville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     On Friday, July 24th, 2020 the Missouri State Preservation Office announced that the Old McDonald County Jail was listed in the National Register of Historic Places by the Department of Interior. This designation is the third for McDonald County. The other two are McDonald County historic landmarks, the Iron Bridge in Powell and the Historic Courthouse on the Square in Pineville.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Located on the historic \"jail lot\" set aside in the early years of the county for a jail, the Old McDonald County Jail will soon receive a plaque to display it's place on the National Register of Historic Places.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     In 1904, Teddy Roosevelt was president, after the assassination of President McKinley in 1901. He won the 1904 November election.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Average wages were 22 cents an hour or around $200 to $400 a year. Only 6% of Americans were high school graduates and 95% of doctors did not have a college degree. Sugar cost 4 cents a pound and eggs averaged 14 cents a dozen. The big event of the year was the World's Fair in St. Louis, which ran from April 30-December 1. 19 million people from 63 countries visited the fair. Foods introduced at the fair included hamburgers, hot dogs, cotton candy and ice cream cones. The Olympics were also held in St. Louis that year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The Old McDonald County jail is a valuable portion of history and will stand the test of time.

El ministro de Defensa, Benny Gantz, declaró que el éxito del sistema interceptor Arrow-2 es parte de la iniciativa del país "de asegurarnos de que siempre estemos un paso delante de nuestros enemigos" en cuanto a tecnología.

Europa Press tiene declaraciones en exclusiva de Santiago Segura a su salida de Espejo Público y cuando le hemos preguntado si estaría dispuesto a hacer una película con las Campos ha confesado que: "Estaría dispuesto a todo, las veo muy bien". Tendremos que esperar a que pase el tiempo para saber si finalmente, Terelu, María Teresa Campos y Carmen Borrego son las protagonistas de la nueva película de Santiago.

The upgrade of the interchange has been discussed for several years, but is not yet part of IDOT’s project list.                                                                                                                                                                                  With the closing of Hammes Avenue, motorists would be not have an entry point to northside neighborhoods until St. Joseph Avenue, roughly a block west.                                                                                                                                                                                  Some concern was expressed about more traffic on St. Joseph, which is a typical two-way street. It was asked if St. Joseph could be widen, and a widening project there would be years away.                                                                                                                                                                                  Another obstacle to development of this area is the location of the Mount Calvary Cemetery. The cemetery is immediately south and west of the interchange.                                                                                                                                                                                  Hoffman said the project includes plans for shrubbery to be planted near the cemetery’s entrance to somewhat block the view of the it.                                                                                                                                                                                  Mayor Chasity Wells-Armstrong said the gateway project is in response to the community’s concerns about the unsightly look at one of the city’s main entry points.                                                                                                                                                                                  The location is in the city’s 7th Ward, which is represented by Carl Brown, D-7. He said this area has been in poor condition since the former Kmart store closed in 1994 and the city must focus on projecting a positive image to those entering the city.                                                                                                                                                                                  “Right now we have a cemetery and many empty lots. We need to project a better image. This is very important to the entire city. This certainly won’t solve everything, but it will definitely make a difference.”                                                                                                                                                                                  Hoffman is hoping the project can go out for bid shortly and the project contract could be awarded within the first two weeks of September.

From Ann Arbor to Los Angeles to Oxford, that most American of pursuits — college football — has either given up hope of getting in a traditional season or is flinging what amounts to a Hail Mary pass in a desperate attempt to hang on in the age of Covid-19.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Even if some schools manage to take the field in the next month or so, it will be a different looking game.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Chances are, Saturdays will never be quite the same again.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Our lives are changing forever right before our eyes," Arizona offensive lineman Donovan Laie said.                                                                                                                                                                                                  While every aspect of society has been jarred by a worldwide pandemic that has claimed more than 160,000 American lives, the potential loss of college football feels like another collective punch to the national psyche.                                                                                                                                                                                                  For all the ills of big-time college athletics, it might the closest thing to a national religion.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Since the virus hit, we've all lost a sense of our normal lives," said Charles Reagan Wilson, professor emeritus at the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi — better known to college football fans as Ole Miss.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "College football could be the balm for our spirit because it's such a part of our familiar autumn life," he added. "I think to not have it would up the ante on that sense of abnormality we're all living through."                                                                                                                                                                                                  That reality has already arrived for fans in two of the country's most prominent conferences. On Tuesday, the Big Ten and the Pac-12 both called off their attempts to play this fall, saying they might try to play in the spring if the virus subsides.                                                                                                                                                                                                  The remaining Power Five conferences — the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast and Big 12 — are pressing on with their attempts to kick off the season next month, though all are quick to acknowledge that the virus could force the to cancel.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ohio State fan Jason Streeter finds it difficult to grasp the concept of a fall without football.                                                                                                                                                                                                  "Devastation," said Streeter, sounding as though a tornado had just swept through town. "It's just a way of life in Columbus, honestly. It really is. You look forward to those fall Saturdays on the banks of the Olentangy."                                                                                                                                                                                                  He talked longingly of traditions that are unique to his school, such as the band's famed script spelling of "Ohio" during its halftime shows in the center of a nearly 103,000-seat stadium known as "The Horseshoe" — capped ff by a lone member high-stepping across the field to "Dot The I."

Further down the college football food chain, smaller leagues have pulled the plug on their seasons as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                  The sting is especially painful at historically Black colleges and universities such as North Carolina A&T, where one of the highlights of football season — really, the entire year — is a week-long homecoming celebration that draws tens of thousands to Greensboro.

Köpke sabe lo que son las luchas por la portería en la selección. El mismo tuvo que resignarse al ver como en el Mundial 94 el entonces seleccionador Berti Vogts apostaba por Bodo Ilgner.
                                                                                                                                                                                  Luego, cuando Köpke fue titular, tuvo que soportar la presión de un joven talentoso que se llamaba Oliver Kahn. Posteriormente Köpke estuvo en el equipo técnico que, antes del Mundial 2006, le comunicó a Kahn que el titular sería Jens Lehmann.

The T200 irons, which replaced the AP3 irons last season, has tungsten weights in the heel and toe for stability and to lower the center of gravity. They provide more distance thanks to the addition of a Max Impact system that can be seen on the back of the head. A screw holds a silicone polymer core in place inside the head, and as the face flexes at impact, the core compresses and then quickly rebounds. That helps the face snap back more efficiently, resulting in more ball speed and distance.

Security vulnerabilities in a few of Amazon's Alexa subdomains allowed hackers to remove or install skills on the targeted victim's Alexa account, access their voice history and personal data, research by cyber security firm Check Point revealed.
 Amazon fixed this issue soon after it was reported, Check Point said.
 The attack required a single click by the user on a malicious link crafted by the hacker and voice interaction by the victim.
 Amazon's Echo smart speakers, which has sold over 200 million units globally, are powered by Alexa, which is capable of voice interaction, setting alerts, music playback, and controlling smart devices in a home automation system.
 Users can extend Alexa's capabilities by installing 'skills', which are voice- driven apps.
 However, the personal information stored in users' Alexa accounts and the device's use as a home automation controller makes them an attractive target for hackers.
 Check Point said its researchers demonstrated how the vulnerabilities they found in certain Amazon/Alexa subdomains could be exploited by a hacker crafting and sending a malicious link to a target user, which appears to come from Amazon.  If the user clicks the link, the attacker can then:

Next, I focused on redirecting my obsession with numbers on a scale. I limited the amount of time I spent comparing myself to others on social media. I spoke more openly about my impulses and urges with my spouse. I spent as many hours outside as possible. I worked in my garden. With dirt under my fingernails and sweat dripping down my face, I proudly watched my daffodils, irises, peonies and roses bloom through the seasons. And then there was the satisfaction of weeding. Ripping out invasive plants - digging down to the root and purging them from my garden. Just like my bulimia, if the root isn't addressed - it will return with a vengeance.

History is a story told from a perspective. Always has been. Even our most revered stories, the Gospels, were identified as “according to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.” Then, as now, history’s a story told, according to someone. Even the present, from which all histories are derived, is a story told from a vantage point. That’s why the four blind men describe the elephant differently, just like back then the four disciples described Jesus’ life differently.                                                                                                                                                                          Accordingly, it surprises me when my four white friends complain our history is being rewritten by those who view the elephant differently. That elephant in the room when discussing our history, of course, is slavery, and while those friends see statues of brave generals and their soldiers charging the hill to glory, others see slaveholders, the ills of slavery and cruel men who in their interpretation were not heroes at all. Not to say all statues should come down, or all flawed historical figures vanquished, but let the conversation happen.                                                                                                                                                                          Similarly, there were many versions of the gospels back in the day, in addition to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, stories of Jesus according to Thomas, Mary, even Judas, to name just a few, that didn’t make the cut. Really, a gospel according to Judas? We are presented with a work, the Bible, called divine, and it may be. Stories according to many, then approved according to a scholarly elite. Not surprisingly, the gospel of Judas didn’t make the cut. Apparently, betraying the Savior was a disqualifier (But not for Peter?). Still, I wonder, how could Judas have his own gospel? In his version, does he portray himself as a nice guy but misunderstood?                                                                                                                                                                          My friends resent these changes to our history. They hate its implications, that a matter they thought was settled can be so unsettled. Folks are trying to bring down those statues, those fixed objects in our mind, as taught to us a long time ago. We hear from some that those same blind men who started the Civil War hijacked the Reconstruction and found new ways to hold power and subjugate the former slaves such as Jim Crow laws and other systematic ills, which, to some degree, continue to this day. They rewrote history back then, turning the war, which was about slavery, into a “lost cause” narrative over defending a southern way of life. My friends, who’s to say that can’t be revised again? Who’s to say we can’t revisit those settled places in our minds and put something new there?                                                                                                                                                                          Jefferson wrote, “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equally.” Jefferson owned slaves. Shall we bring down his statue? Perhaps his statue, more than anybody’s, speaks to our nation’s conflicted history: The flawed man and his revolutionary ideals. A view of the elephant from where we are, and where we aspire to go. Keep his statue please. If we insist all our statues be of people without flaws, we’ll have no statues.                                                                                                                                                                          History gets revised. Happens all the time. Let’s revisit that old narrative, those old statues, maybe some should come down, and be replaced by heroes true to the American ideals, like those who preached, among other things, that we shall overcome. Let’s celebrate champions who moved us closer to Jefferson’s vision, to the ideals that make America great. With whom should we identify? The man trying to breathe or the man with a knee on his neck? Those folks crossing a bridge toward greater equality or those authorities trying to deny their freedom? I hope you identify more with the humble than the arrogant, the oppressed than the oppressor, because I’m certain the soul of the humble has a much greater chance of redemption than the soul of the arrogant.                                                                                                                                                                          In the Gospels, according to all four “approved” apostles, you know this to be true. What a great chapter in the American gospel, when we can finally tell the story of how we all crossed that bridge together.                                                                                                                                                                           _Sal Moretti is a retired Bakersfield superintendent and former USAF Captain.
