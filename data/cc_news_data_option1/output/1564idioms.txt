Anche su Italia 1 questo martedì sera sarà dedicato al grande cinema, con Jurassic Park, nella sua prima versione del 1992. Un divertente film d’avventura, anche in questo caso dedicato a tutta la famiglia. Su rete 4 la serata è invece dedicata all’approfondimento giornalistico, con Mario Giordano a condurre la discussione. Su RAI 2 potremo seguire una nuova puntata di “Pechino Express” programma divertente, che vede viaggiare alcune coppie, note e meno note, svolgendo i compiti richiesti ogni sera dalla produzione. Come viene specificato ad ogni puntata il programma è stato registrato alcuni mesi fa, quando l’emergenza coronavirus non era ancora attiva. Le coppie in gara hanno viaggiato nel sud est asiatico, questa sera il programma arriva al suo termine con la puntata finale. Su RAI3 la padrona di casa è invece Bianca Berlinguer, con Carta bianca, il programma di approfondimento giornalistico, con buona probabilità dedicato stasera ai fatti di cronaca correlati al Covid-19.
