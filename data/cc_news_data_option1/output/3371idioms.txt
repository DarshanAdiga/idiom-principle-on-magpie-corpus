Officials in Houston asked residents to prepare supplies in case they lose power for a few days or need to evacuate homes along the coast.
 State emergencies were declared in Louisiana and Mississippi, and shelters opened with cots set farther apart, among other measures designed to curb infections.
 Laura’s unwelcome arrival comes just days before the Aug. 29 anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which breached the levees in New Orleans, flattened much of the Mississippi coast and killed as many as 1,800 people in 2005. Hurricane Rita then struck southwest Louisiana that Sept. 24 as a Category 3 storm.
 Now southwest Louisiana again faces the threat of being hit by a major hurricane, and Rita is on the mind of Ron Leleux.
 ”Finally we ran out of luck in 2005 with Rita,” Leleux said from his home in Sulphur, where he served as mayor from 2002-2010. “When something like this comes up, I think people go back and it brings back a lot of bad memories.”
 In the southwest corner of Louisiana, Capt. Tommy Adams, a local fishing guide, was prepared for anything but said “you never know what’s going to happen.
 ”I’m moving to a house a little more inland just to be on the safe side, probably about an hour north, just to be on the safe side,” said Adams, who also lives in Sulphur.
 In Waveland, Mississippi, a coastal town devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2015, Jeremy Burke said “our biggest threat down here is the storm surge.” When Katrina struck, “the wind did do damage, but the thing that put the nail in the coffin was the storm surge,” said Burke, who owns Bay Books in nearby Bay St. Louis.
 Many residents in Waveland are staying in place as Laura bears down on the coast, but they also have their cars and trucks gassed up in case the forecast grows more ominous, Burke said.
 ”People are prepared to possibly go at the drop of a hat,” he said. “We never take a storm for granted. We might have dodged a bullet with Marco, and obviously some people along the Gulf Coast are not going to be as blessed as us.”

The nature of online distribution channels is vastly different from traditional distribution channels. The Film and Publication Board is consulting the creative and distribution industry to simplify the process of classifying commercial online content. This includes the possibility for these online service providers to self-classify based on South Africa’s classification system or applying for the accreditation of a recognised and aligned international classification system.

The government said 2,519 fresh cases were reported in the 24 hours to 8 am Wednesday, taking the caseload to 302,147.
 The death toll surged to 4,082 after 54 fatalities were registered in the same period.
 Another 3,427 patients overcame the disease through treatment at home and in hospital care during that time as the number of daily recoveries once again outpaced new cases. It brings the recovery count to 190,183, according to data released by the health directorate.
 A total of 15,070 samples were tested at 92 authorised labs across the country in the last 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 16.72 percent.
 The official figures take the recovery rate from COVID-19 to 62.94 percent, while the latest deaths of 39 men and 15 women took the mortality rate to 1.35 percent.
 Globally, over 23.91 million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus and 819,830 have died, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
 Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.
 Bangladesh reported its first cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, on Mar 8. It took 87 days for the disease to infect 50,000 people but the tally doubled to 100,000 on Jun 18 in the space of just 16 days.
 In a bid to contain the rampant spread of the disease, the government enforced a nationwide lockdown for more than two months before lifting the restrictions on May 31.
 Since then, the epidemic has continued to rampage through the country at an alarming rate. The case count hit 100 on Apr 6 before crossing the 1,000-mark a week later on Apr 14.
 By May 25, the number of cases had exceeded 20,000 and reached 50,000 on Jun 2. The tally subsequently surged past 100,000 on Jun 18 and doubled over the next 30 days to reach 200,000 on Jul 18.
 The caseload rose by 50,000 over the next 20 days and it took another 19 days since to reach the 300,000-mark on Wednesday.
 Bangladesh has the 15th-highest caseload in the world, currently behind Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Ginger Herter, who manages the shop, was erring on the side of caution boarding up the storefront as she waits to see what path Tropical Storm Laura will take as it heads toward the Texas and Louisiana coasts. “I’d rather do this and have to take them down rather than scramble to get them up later in the week,” she said.

University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy also said that he would “give it a pretty decent chance of a Category 3 or 4, not necessarily at landfall, at least during its lifetime in the Gulf.”
 Still a tropical storm for now, Laura passed Cuba after killing at least 11 people in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where it knocked out power and caused flooding in the two nations that share the island of Hispaniola. The deaths reportedly included a 10-year-old girl whose home was hit by a tree and a mother and young son who were crushed by a collapsing wall.
 Now forecasters are turning their attention the Gulf Coast, where up to 11 feet (3.4 meters) of sea water — storm surge — could inundate the coastline from High Island in Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana, the hurricane center said. On top of that, up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain could fall in some spots in Louisiana, Jones said.
 “Whatever happens, happens. We’re going to roll with the punches,” said Capt. Brad Boudreaux, who operates a fishing guide service in Hackberry, Louisiana, near the Texas line.
 The silver lining for U.S. coastal residents is that an earlier storm — Marco — greatly weakened and became a remnant just off Louisiana’s shore on Tuesday. Satellite images showed a disorganized cluster of clouds. It was relegated to what meteorologists call “a naked swirl,” Jones said.
 Laura was sustaining top winds of 65 mph (100 kmh) Tuesday morning after passing between the western tip of Cuba and Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula. It was centered 680 miles (1095 kilometers) southeast of Lake Charles, and moving toward the U.S. coast at 17 mph (28 kmh).
 The hurricane center warned people not to focus on the details of the official forecast, since “storm surge, wind, and rainfall hazards will extend well away from Laura’s center along the Gulf Coast.”
 In Port Arthur Texas, Mayor Thurman Bartie issued a mandatory evacuation order for the city’s more than 54,000 residents starting at 6 a.m. Tuesday. People planning on entering official shelters can bring just one bag of personal belongings each, and must “have a mask” to reduce the spread of coronavirus, the order said.
 ”If you decide to stay, you’re staying on your own,” Bartie said.

 Effectively following an entire NBA season is an exercise in managing perspective.
 So much time is spent immersed in the hypothetical: the next free-agency coup, possible superstar trades, the rush to coronate one contender and unseat another. Moments go underappreciated or get lost entirely amid this carousel of cause and effect. Appreciating and reflecting on the now is difficult when there's always a bigger picture.
 Giannis Antetounmpo is among the few stars who merge both schools of coverage.
 What he's doing now is never ignored because he's made it impossible to do so. Every season of his career is a march of progress. He's a viable franchise cornerstone, then a star, then a megastar, then an MVP, then an MVP favorite. And his (literal) giant strides act in service of the longer view, a leaguewide takeover that has fueled obsession over his future and, more importantly, solidified his trajectory as one of the all-time greats.
