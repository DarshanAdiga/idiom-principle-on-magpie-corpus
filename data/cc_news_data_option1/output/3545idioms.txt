“As the law stands today, we don’t need the agreement for the Israeli government to permit Muslims from otehr countries to go to the Temple Mount,” Dr. Kedar said. “Any visitor to Israel can go straight from the airport to the Temple Mount, or the beach, or anywhere in the country. Israel does not have to agree to this or give special permission to visitors from the UAE.”

Whatever is going on is exceptionally dangerous. The build up of offensive military capacity – particularly nuclear capable bombers – in two areas of high political tension is potentially disastrous. These may well be understood as aggressive measures towards two countries that Trump has identified, in no uncertain terms, as strategic competitors against which he is prepared to wage war and win.

I was recently asked if smokers are at bigger risk of susceptibility of COVID-19 and would that mean more severe illness as a result. While it’s tempting to consider that there might be a relationship, it’s very important that we keep our biases in check and wait for the emergence of real data, which can take up to one year.
 There are more than 480,000 smoking-related deaths per year, and we are on the verge of 200,000 deaths as a result of COVID-19 in the United States since March.
 Both are considered epidemics, and I feel that behavior can play a significant role in many outcomes.
 I think a lot of people have difficulty thinking two weeks forward into consequences of behavior. “I want to go to the bar,” “I want to go to that party,” “I want to go to the beach,” “I’m sick and tired of being home.” This is a built-in feature of being human. Those behaviors where social distancing might not have occurred might lead to coronavirus outbreaks.
 So, if we say a person can’t think two weeks ahead of consequences, how do we expect one to look 20 to 40 years into the future as it relates to the harmful risks associated with smoking?
 I don’t think that it’s because people aren’t smart or don’t care about their health. I think it is very difficult for people to connect their choices in the present with their outcomes in the future, particularly when the risk is delayed and uncertain and when an individual is asked to give up something they want right now.

COVID-19 has severely impacted East Asia as it has every other region. The East Asia and Pacific region (fifteen countries and territories, including six added to those in Table 1) has had its share of infections and deaths, though as a proportion of world totals (as of mid-August 2020), the numbers are very low: about 2.6 percent of cases and 2 percent of deaths.12 But infection and death tolls do not display the links between a health crisis and poverty. For East Asia and the Pacific, the World Bank estimates that COVID-19 will have a devastating effect on regional economic growth and therefore on poverty rates. The last five years of gains will all be erased, it says. Specifically, the Bank reports that whereas before the pandemic 35 million people in East Asia and the Pacific would have escaped poverty (at $5.50), now some 25 million additional people will fall into poverty, plus another 11 million if economies continue to go downhill.13Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand are all predicted to experience major economic _contractions_ before recovering in 2021.14

Queried about the end-year target, Mishra pointed to the expanded scale of the current mission and legacy issues. “The 2020 target must be seen in light of the scale and size of the Mission vis-a-vis previous Ganga projects which suffered funding constraints and a piecemeal approach. We decided, instead, to bring in a more holistic and performance-oriented approach to each Ganga city, covering towns along both sides of the bank, involving private sector to ensure maintenance of facilities designed for next 15 years,” the NMCG director general said.

We’ve got Liz Truss, Minister for Women and Equalities, trying to roll back rights for Trans people by making things harder to transition, and protecting safe spaces for women. Cabinet members like Pritti Patel, who actively voted against gay marriage. These people may say that they are our “Allies”, but they are far from it – and it is a scary place to be for the LGBTQ+ community. Remember, that we are not even 20 years out of Section 28, and there is every chance that something like that could be brought back. Oh, and that ban on conversion therapy – we’re still waiting. If you are curious as to how your MP voted on social issues, there is a great website which shows you exactly who vote for what. It’s there in black and white. Either they vote against, or even worse – “we’re not present”. It’s a kick in the teeth.
