"We can see with 'Gone With the Wind' how profoundly people's understanding of American history has been shaped by these popular entertainments," says Stewart.

“Let Gone With the Wind be gone with the wind,” the 50-year-old hip-hop icon told the Associated Press.                                                                                                                                       Latifah specifically takes umbrage with the treatment of Hattie McDaniel, who played Mammy, and ultimately became the first African-American to be nominated for and to win an Academy Award.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The “Ladies First” rapper says, while historic, people need to be aware of McDaniel’s treatment during the coveted cinema ceremony that year.                                                                                                                                       “They didn’t even let her in the theater until right before she got that award,” Latifah explained, pointing out that segregation prevented the groundbreaking actress from celebrating her history-making achievement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              “Someone came outside and brought her into the auditorium. She wasn’t even allowed to sit in there… and then she had to read a speech that was written by a studio. You know that’s not what the hell she wanted to say.”                                                                                                                                       Winning the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and making history didn’t change McDaniel’s life.                                                                                                                                       “Then after that, all she could do was play the same kinds of roles,” the Oscar nominee maintained, adding that McDaniel’s racial struggles are similar to those faced by present-day black actors and actresses.                                                                                                                                       "So the opportunities at that time and the way that those in power in that business were relegating us and marginalizing us and not allowing us to grow and thrive after that was just terrible," she concluded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Hattie McDaniel story is close to Latifah’s heart; after extensively researching to portray her in Ryan Murphy’s acclaimed new anthology series “Hollywood,” which re-imagines the golden era of Tinseltown.                                                                                                                                       While HBO Max hasn’t announced when “Gone with the Wind” will return to its catalog, University of Chicago cinema professor and Turner Classic Movies host Jacqueline Stewart revealed in a CNN op-ed that, when it does, she will provide an introduction “placing the film in its multiple historical contexts.”                                                                                                                                       Since the renewed controversy, the Victor Fleming-helmed epic is among the top movies on the Apple TV menu.

Instead, with Kaepernick coming off of three offseason surgeries (shoulder, knee, thumb), Blaine Gabbert was named the 49ers' starter to begin the 2016 season. Kaepernick eventually took back the job in Week 6 and for the most part played well, but the 49ers won just two games, leading to another coaching change. Amid such organizational dysfunction, Kaepernick restructured his contract so he could opt out after the 2016 season, which he did.                          In Kaepernick's last season in the NFL, he played in 12 games, threw 16 touchdowns to just 4 interceptions with a 59.2 completion percentage and managed a passer rating of 90.7. (He added 468 yards and a pair of scores on the ground.) For reference, Tom Brady's passer rating last season was 88.0.                          So yes, his play was still plenty "up to snuff."

This doesn't mean that DACA is completely safe, however. The ruling here means that Trump and co. were wrong in the _way_ they tried to kill DACA, not in the attempt. If they were to, theoretically, provide a well-reasoned and complete explanation for ending the program and then do so, they might be allowed to, though they would face more legal challenges and court scrutiny that they might not want to deal with. Such a move would also require firm legal reasoning and thoughtfulness from the Trump administration, which is not something they are known for, to say the least.

Donald Trump has chewed and spat out aides left and right but he hasn't faced one quite like John Bolton, a wily Washington veteran with his own sense of grievance.          While other former advisors have kept respectful silences or narrowly tailored their critiques, Bolton has written a blistering memoir challenging Trump's intelligence, ethics and basic competence.          With his bushy white mustache and studious adjusting of his glasses, Bolton had been semi-retired as a talking head on Fox News when the television-loving Trump tapped him as his third national security advisor in 2018.           The match appeared odd from the start.          While Trump rails about the "Deep State" and wasteful foreign deployments, Bolton is a master of the Washington bureaucracy who unrepentantly pushed the Iraq invasion and has campaigned to bomb Iran and North Korea.          But both Bolton and Trump share a disdain for "the elites" at home and abroad. For the president, born into wealth, enemies include media and academics who see him as a buffoon.          Bolton, the son of a Baltimore firefighter, has described his rage after winning acceptance to Yale University at watching wealthier students protest the Vietnam War -- in which Bolton did not serve himself, explaining in a 2007 book that he was not prepared to die if liberals then made concessions to the enemy.          In the previous memoir, "Surrender is Not an Option," Bolton, unusually for a US official, vented at the British, saying that the allies believed in their "superior suaveness" toward Americans and in "smoothing off our regrettable colonial rough edges."          Where Trump and Bolton found common cause was in a passion for fighting global institutions such as UN agencies and the International Criminal Court.          In one of Bolton's most memorable remarks, he dismissed the United Nations in a 1994 speech, quipping that if the 38-floor secretariat in New York "lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference."          That did not stop George W. Bush from making him US ambassador to the United Nations, although the president controversially bypassed the Senate where opposition to Bolton ran deep.          Trump brought up the Senate episode when attacking Bolton on Fox News after excerpts from his book became public, calling the 71-year-old a "washed-up guy" to whom he gave a fresh chance.          - Questions on motivations -          Bolton, who has served under Republican presidents since Ronald Reagan, again showed his deftness at the Washington game Wednesday when multiple newspapers published some of his juiciest allegations -- just as the Trump administration was trying to block the book, saying it contained classified material.          But his motivations -- as well as his writing style -- were widely called into question.          In a stinging review, New York Times book critic Jennifer Szalai scoffed at Bolton's explanations for why he did not testify in Trump's impeachment.          "The clotted prose, the garbled argument and the sanctimonious defensiveness would seem to indicate some sort of ambivalence on his part -- a feeling that he doesn't seem to have very often," she wrote.          She said that Bolton described his turning point as when Trump called off plans to strike Iran, even after the national security advisor went home for a change of clothes, excited for a long night at the White House.          Many of the early excerpts criticize Trump over his wooing of North Korean strongman Kim Jong Un -- on which Bolton's opposition was well known, contributing to his exit in September.          Bolton charges in the book that Trump is concerned only about winning re-election and not any larger US interest and makes the bombshell allegation that the president asked his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for help securing a second term.          Both Democrats and Republicans questioned why Bolton, if he felt so strongly about Trump's conduct, waited to speak now.          The liberal television commentator Lawrence O'Donnell said that Bolton, "like Trump, is a dishonorable man who cares more about money than his constitutional duty."          Republican Representative Doug Collins pointed to Bolton's reported $2 million advance for the book, tweeting: "Apparently that's all it took for John Bolton to sell off what little credibility he had left."          But Bill Kristol, a prominent conservative thinker who opposes Trump, wrote on his website The Bulwark that "almost every Republican official" knows Bolton personally and no one considers him a liar.          "John Bolton may not be the epitome of warmth, humor or even kindness. But he is honest," Kristol said.

The risk remains of exacerbating the spread of a highly contagious and deadly virus.                                                                                                                                       The reward is entertainment, first on television, someday again in the bleachers and luxury boxes and sports bars. It is also economic. There are billions of dollars to be made and spent.                                                                                                                                       “People who are not sports fans, I could see how they might question if it’s responsible to restart sports, especially when somebody isn’t allowed to restart their job,” said Dawn Comstock, a sports epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.                                                                                                                                       She and others also wonder about the ethics of spending finite resources on sports — testing, especially — that might be used elsewhere.                                                                                                                                       For now, it is mostly the professional leagues desperately trying to reboot, perhaps setting an example that will flow through colleges, high schools and youth sports.                                                                                                                                       They are navigating those epic concerns while trying to appease their fans and finances, getting mired in politics, logistics and geography. Comstock said she believed rules could be put in place to make most sports safe. Few are asking if those rules can be followed.                                                                                                                                       She noted a high school baseball team in Iowa, kneeling shoulder to shoulder, without masks, during the national anthem Monday. She saw a girls’ soccer scrimmage at a park in Denver on Tuesday, the parents spread out but the substitutes on the sideline gathered close to the coach.                                                                                                                                       And what of the high-five, the huddle, the mob after a goal or a game-winning home run?                                                                                                                                       “It’s such a challenge, not just because of the virus, but how we play sports,” Comstock said. “The activities are so ingrained and part of the culture that even when the sport can be played safely, it’s not likely that the participant will be willing to adopt the guidelines needed to do that.”                                                                                                                                       She laughed.                                                                                                                                       “And that’s just the players,” she said.                                                                                                                                       Putting people in the stands is riskier and more complicated. In a recent New York Times survey of more than 500 epidemiologists, 64% said they would wait a year or more before attending a sporting event, concert or play. It was a higher percentage than any other activity.                                                                                                                                       “Not that I don’t love sporting events, but for me, the risk-reward ratio is wrong,” Mooney said.                                                                                                                                       Rutherford, at UC-San Francisco, expects there will be major college football in the fall, partly because there is so much money at stake, and also some fans — spread out, masked, maybe even tested.                                                                                                                                       “Ten, 12, 15,000 fans, mostly season-ticket holders? Yeah, that strikes me as doable,” he said. “Trying to fill up the Rose Bowl? That’s another issue.”                                                                                                                                       Mooney is more pessimistic. Even classes on most campuses are not certain.                                                                                                                                       “I think it’s unlikely that there will be football games at UW in the fall,” he said of Washington, a member of the Pac-12 Conference. “I’d be pretty outraged if I need to teach my class remotely, but the football stadium is filled with people who intermingle.”                                                                                                                                       Still, plans are emerging, clunkily. On Monday, the WNBA announced plans for shortened, single-site season, beginning in July, though no schedule was released.                                                                                                                                       The same day, MLB’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said he was “not confident” that there would be a 2020 season, a week after saying “unequivocally” that he was “100%” sure there would be.                                                                                                                                       The change was foreboding. If professional baseball could not figure out how to play games in the summer, which it has been doing since the 1870s, what hope is there for everyone else?                                                                                                                                       (By Wednesday, Manfred was claiming that he and the players’ union head had reached an agreement, but it still needs the players to sign off.)

He said Moultrians may not be able to hold people outside the city accountable, but we need to hold each other accountable. Racism shouldn’t be taking place, he said, especially if the citizens are God-fearing people.                  “And I’m not harping on God-fearing people, but the thing is, if you believe in God, you believe in equality -- you believe in justice,” Wallace said.                  Wallace said a pastor shouldn’t be saying things like Ponder had said, but he added his own counterpoint.                  “If I was a minister, my son is on the ground, begging for his dead mother while somebody’s knee is on his neck and he’s dying, I don’t know where God would take me right then and there,” Wallace said.                  Criticism didn’t come only for Ponder, it came for Dillard and the city at large too.                  Moultrie NAACP President Isabella Brooks said she was heartbroken by Thibodeau’s post, which implied George Floyd deserved to die for his previous crimes, including robbery and drug offenses.                  Brooks said she’d hoped by now that people would do the right thing and made a point: This wouldn’t have happened if Blacks had equal representation among the city’s department heads.                  “We have a vacancy for the fire chief of this city,” she said. “We have never had a Black, Hispanic, or Oriental fire chief.”                  In a city where almost 50 percent of its denizens are people of color, she said they need equal representation among city leadership.                  Steven Reynolds, a coach and the owner of the Fifty Yard Line Sports Bar, said prominently, “Black Lives Matter,” as he came up to the podium. There is a lot of cry for racial change in the city and country, said Reynolds, who also ran for city council in the most recent election.                  He said the standard of living for African American citizens of Moultrie is second-class. He said, speaking for the Black people of the community, that “we no longer trust the city manager.”                  This came out of a situation where Shonta Melton expressed her concerns about Thibodeau to Dillard but was met with a “half-hearted” apology.                  “He was hoping that the matter would just go away like a number of other questionable decisions that he has made regarding African Americans and people of color since becoming the city manager,” Reynolds said.                  Dillard said that wasn’t in his character and you could talk to anyone who’s worked with him in the past 40 years about that. To describe his efforts to bring diversity to the city, he told the crowd about searching for a replacement for the previous fire chief.                  “About a year ago, we needed a new fire chief. The first thing I did is I went to the most highly respected fire chief in the state that I’d met three years before,” Dillard said.                  This was Freddie Broome, the current member services consultant of the Georgia Municipal Association. Dillard said Broome turned around the Valdosta Fire Department.                  “I said, ‘I need help. I need diversity in the fire department in Moultrie.’ He said, ‘You’re going to have a battle because it’s hard to move people over there from Valdosta, from other places,’” Dillard said.                  But Dillard still asked for any help Broome could give. Broome could send only three recommendations -- three white men, one of whom was Thibodeau.                  “I called and said, ‘Chief Broome, I know I got to be careful with my language, I don’t want to be discriminate here, but I need diversity,’” Dillard said. “He said, ‘I tried, but they won’t leave to Moultrie.’”                  Dillard said he called two other city managers for diverse recommendations but to no avail.                  “So yeah, those are the labor pains and the baby isn’t here, but I’m going to try again,” Dillard said. “Have I been successful with other diversity? No, I haven’t, but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been one heck of an effort.”

(Gray News) – Check your enthusiasm. Football may not happen this fall after all.The warning comes from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“Unless players are essentially in a bubble - insulated from the community and they are tested nearly every day - it would be very hard to see how football is able to be played this fall,” Fauci told CNN.“If there is a second wave, which is certainly a possibility and which would be complicated by the predictable flu season, football may not happen this year.”The prediction comes even as the NFL and NCAA are ramping up for fall ball.On Wednesday, the NCAA gave the green light for offseason workout plans for football. Voluntary workouts began earlier this month.In a May memo, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell provided teams with protocols on how to gradually reopen their facilities.Still, numerous college players have tested positive for coronavirus as they’ve reported back to campus.And on Monday, several Houston Texans and Dallas Cowboys players tested positive.For now, the college football season is slated to kick off on Aug. 29. NFL preseason games are scheduled to start Aug. 6.Copyright 2020 Gray Media Group, Inc. All rights reserved.

The lockdown is all over, bar the shouting.                           One can now go to churches of a different kind now - the casino and the restaurant.                           It was inevitable that South Africa would reach this point of reopening. Lockdown cannot be sustained forever. At some point people have to resume - and be trusted to resume - their ordinary lives. And so, for governments all around the world, the reopening of the economy has been about calculated risk, or what President Ramaphosa has called the ‘delicate balance’ of protecting livelihoods and saving lives.                           In South Africa that balance was of a special kind given our deep levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment.                           Generally speaking, Ramaphosa and his Cabinet colleagues had the country’s support when he announced the hard lockdown in late March. Even during its extension we understood the need to buy time to prepare for the inevitability of a spike in infections. The intention was always about ‘flattening the curve’ and preparing the country for the inevitable surge in infections.                           We will learn, in time, whether government used the period during which South Africa was in hard lockdown to prepare adequately for the health crisis yet to come.                           The Western Cape will be heading towards the spike first in the country, it seems, and already health services are under severe pressure.                           So when President Ramaphosa addressed the nation on Wednesday evening, his emphasis on personal responsibility was the most obvious next step.                          Ramaphosa announced what government has previously called ‘advanced level 3’- a clear adjustment of tone given the economic pressures the country faces as a result of the coronavirus lockdown.                           What one looks for in addresses of this kind is a measure of empathy and understanding, but also consistent internal logic.                           On empathy and understanding, Ramaphosa can ‘tick the box’. He clearly does have sufficient levels of empathy - whether he acts in accordance with that at all times is debatable, but he is hardly the narcissistic Donald Trump - a relief in the circumstances - or a derelict, laughing Jacob Zuma.                           It bears repeating that the internal logic of lockdown was abandoned in late May when Ramaphosa announced that churches would reopen for 50 worshipers at a time, when clear evidence from around the world indicates that the reopening of churches has had a direct impact on the increase in infection rates.                           In his latest address, Ramaphosa announced the reopening of restaurants, personal care salons, spas and casinos.  All reopening is naturally subject to health protocols. That is understandable, yet the internal logic has again been abandoned as it would mean one can visit a restaurant, casino or hair salon, but not do a house visit to friends and family.                           And the tobacco ban remains in place even as every other ‘ban’ is tumbling like skittles around it. This has become an intense and personal battle between the industry and the minister of COGTA, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.                           It would appear that government prefers some lobbyists above others. How else can we understand the inconsistency in its approach? Disallowing family visits seems absurd in the circumstances.                           Ramaphosa was right to place a renewed emphasis on personal responsibility. Yet, citizens are less likely to take responsibility if certain rules which defy logic remain in place.                           As usual, we will have to wait for the relevant ministers’ briefings for sectoral reopening dates.                           Given the extent to which lockdown rules have been eased, this also makes little sense. By now most businesses have been waiting to reopen and have hatched plans regarding safety protocols. A date should simply be announced without leaving us at the mercy of ministerial briefings, which mostly consist of endless repetition and little substance.                           Personal responsibility will require discipline South Africans are not well known for.                           It will also require public education. The public education aspect of dealing with the pandemic was always going to be difficult in a country as disparate as ours.                           This week the indefatigable Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called for a ‘grassroots’ fight against the virus as he launched the Ministerial Advisory Committee (MAC) on Social Behavioural Change. It includes faith-based organisations, trade unions and civil society.                                           “The fight against COVID-19 is going to be won at home, in a church, in a taxi, on the streets, in a restaurant… and in every part of our social lives. It is not about whether there is a curfew or there is a policeman watching your movements. This is now about every South African taking the fight on,” Mkhize said.                          It took a while for government to get to this point.                          It skipped a beat right at the start with the failure to include community workers and local leaders as they attempted to educate citizens about the dangers of the virus. Public information campaigns have been too little too late and not as pervasive in all areas as they ought to be. The ‘top down’ approach so loved by our inefficient state simply increases citizens’ scepticism and also provides ample opportunities for fed-up citizens to breach regulations.                           But, it needs to be more proactive in partnering with communities.  Mkhize’s MAC is a first step. Government’s focus should now also be a far-reaching, single-minded 11-language campaign to educate people about this virus. It should reach everyone - rich and poor, young and old.                           The clear messaging that now has to come from government is that the pandemic is not yet at its peak and it is deadly and dangerous. The reopening of the large swathes of the economy should not signal that the worst is over. Ironically, this seems to be the case.                           The worst is coming, in fact, and wide-scale public education and benevolent ‘policing’ within key areas such as taxi ranks and spot checks at workplaces to ensure that protocols are being followed should be the order of the day.                           Ultimately, however, dealing with the pandemic will require behavioural change in a country where it is often difficult to make those changes.                          It will be a while until we reach the so-called ‘Post-COVID’ world so often spoken about. In the meantime, it really is up to us.

The risk remains of exacerbating the spread of a highly contagious and deadly virus.                                                       The reward is entertainment, first on television, someday again in the bleachers and luxury boxes and sports bars. It is also economic. There are billions of dollars to be made and spent.                                                       “People who are not sports fans, I could see how they might question if it’s responsible to restart sports, especially when somebody isn’t allowed to restart their job,” said Dawn Comstock, a sports epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health.                                                       She and others also wonder about the ethics of spending finite resources on sports — testing, especially — that might be used elsewhere.                                                       For now, it is mostly the professional leagues desperately trying to reboot, perhaps setting an example that will flow through colleges, high schools and youth sports.                                                       They are navigating those epic concerns while trying to appease their fans and finances, getting mired in politics, logistics and geography. Comstock said she believed rules could be put in place to make most sports safe. Few are asking if those rules can be followed.                                                       She noted a high school baseball team in Iowa, kneeling shoulder to shoulder, without masks, during the national anthem Monday. She saw a girls’ soccer scrimmage at a park in Denver on Tuesday, the parents spread out but the substitutes on the sideline gathered close to the coach.                                                       And what of the high-five, the huddle, the mob after a goal or a game-winning home run?                                                       “It’s such a challenge, not just because of the virus, but how we play sports,” Comstock said. “The activities are so ingrained and part of the culture that even when the sport can be played safely, it’s not likely that the participant will be willing to adopt the guidelines needed to do that.”                                                       She laughed.                                                       “And that’s just the players,” she said.                                                       Putting people in the stands is riskier and more complicated. In a recent New York Times survey of more than 500 epidemiologists, 64% said they would wait a year or more before attending a sporting event, concert or play. It was a higher percentage than any other activity.                                                       “Not that I don’t love sporting events, but for me, the risk-reward ratio is wrong,” Mooney said.                                                       Rutherford, at UC-San Francisco, expects there will be major college football in the fall, partly because there is so much money at stake, and also some fans — spread out, masked, maybe even tested.                                                       “Ten, 12, 15,000 fans, mostly season-ticket holders? Yeah, that strikes me as doable,” he said. “Trying to fill up the Rose Bowl? That’s another issue.”                                                       Mooney is more pessimistic. Even classes on most campuses are not certain.                                                       “I think it’s unlikely that there will be football games at UW in the fall,” he said of Washington, a member of the Pac-12 Conference. “I’d be pretty outraged if I need to teach my class remotely, but the football stadium is filled with people who intermingle.”                                                       Still, plans are emerging, clunkily. On Monday, the WNBA announced plans for shortened, single-site season, beginning in July, though no schedule was released.                                                       The same day, MLB’s commissioner, Rob Manfred, said he was “not confident” that there would be a 2020 season, a week after saying “unequivocally” that he was “100%” sure there would be.                                                       The change was foreboding. If professional baseball could not figure out how to play games in the summer, which it has been doing since the 1870s, what hope is there for everyone else?                                                       (By Wednesday, Manfred was claiming that he and the players’ union head had reached an agreement, but it still needs the players to sign off.)

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Colin Kaepernick should get another chance in the National Football League -- "if he has the playing ability."                          Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, has been a free agent for more than three years after he began kneeling during the National Anthem to protest police brutality. Trump has long opposed athletes kneeling during the National Anthem and even referred to them as "sons of bitches" in a 2017 speech.                          But asked by Sinclair reporter Scott Thuman on Wednesday if Kaepernick deserves another shot, Trump said, "If he deserves it, he should. If he has the playing ability. His playing wasn't up to snuff."                          "The answer is absolutely I would, as far as kneeling, I would love to see him get another shot but obviously he has to be able to play well," he continued. "If he can't play well, I think that would be very unfair."                          His comments come after NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told ESPN Monday that he would support and encourage a team interested in signing Kaepernick.                          "Well, listen, if he wants to resume his career in the NFL, then obviously it's going to take a team to make that decision," Goodell said. "But I welcome that, support a club making that decision and encourage them to do that."                          The discussions come as the nation has been gripped by protests and conversations about police brutality and racism in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Breonna Taylor in Louisville and Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, at the hands of police.                          Kaepernick hasn't played in the league since the 2016 season -- the same season he first sat during the playing of the National Anthem. The protest evolved into kneeling after onetime Seattle Seahawk and Green Beret Nate Boyer convinced Kaepernick it would be more respectful to the nation's military, the quarterback has said.                          He later accused NFL team owners of colluding to keep him from being signed. The NFL denied any collusion but in 2019, they reached a settlement with Kaepernick and former teammate Eric Reid, who knelt with him.                          Trump's comments Wednesday also come after Housing and Urban Development Secretary Dr. Ben Carson said earlier this week that he is urging the President to reconsider his position on keeling.                          "Well, I don't think he has manifested as much animosity in that region lately," Carson, the only black member of the President's Cabinet, said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. "And I think we just continue to work him. He'll get there."                          CNN's Amir Vera and Jill Martin contributed to this report.

The last time we spoke with Mistress Carrie, the wound sustained from seeing WAAF sign off for good was still very fresh. But now, after a little time off to figure out the future, she's putting her big foot first, and moving forward with her latest project in a string of new ventures, "The Mistress Carrie Podcast."                          While the new podcast isn't the first we've heard from her since February, as she's cultivated a community on social media for a Facebook livestream called "Cocktails in the War Room," which she considers to be a "happy accident," the new venture marks the Leominster native's official return to the mic after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the brakes on any opportunities she had lined up after the demise of AAF as we knew and loved it ended her 22-year run on the air. Podcasting is by no means new territory for Carrie, after having worked with the format during her stretch at the station, and she's excited for the opportunities that lie ahead.                                         WAAF sold to Christian broadcaster                                         "Podcasting is something I've always been interested in," Carrie told the Daily News' sister publication, Worcester Magazine. "But once the coronavirus hit, and it really looked like radio, as an industry, was going to change and maybe not go back to the way it was, I really started focusing a lot of my time on researching podcasting, really looking into how mine could be different, what I could bring to the table and what resources I would have available to me."                          While there were a lot of key elements to consider in starting her own podcast from scratch, the main thing was having a devoted space to make it happen -- so she built her own studio.                          Want news like this sent straight to your inbox? Head over to MetroWestDailyNews.com to sign up for Entertainment Headlines and make sure you never miss a thing. You pick the news you want, we deliver.                          Now, having her own studio, Carrie's plans for the future of the podcast take on many forms above and beyond just sitting at the mic, and give her the freedom to explore a range of possibilities to grow the scope of her new production company, Big Foot First Productions, a name which gives a nod to both the idea of moving on to the next thing, as well as the fact that one of her feet is bigger than the other.                          While she doesn't want to be the woman who just talks about how she used to work at WAAF, Carrie is fully aware of the fact that no radio station in the region can fill its shoes, in terms of what they represented with exposing new bands to the rock and metal community. So, in a way, she's taking the torch into her own hands and continuing the mission to bring new and exciting music to the masses with the podcast, and while she's excited for the opportunity, there is a certain amount of nerves present as she soldiers on.                          "It's incredibly exciting, and it's incredibly scary all at the same time," says Carrie. "If you win, it's on you, and if you lose, it's on you too. I never was out there alone, because I had the staff of the greatest rock station that's ever existed by my side, and now it's all on me."                          While the 30 years of experience she has backing her brings a certain comfort level to the podcast, the friendships she's forged with some of the biggest names in rock have also continued to repay her for the years of support and admiration she's given them.                          For example, the show's theme song was composed and performed by Godsmack frontman Sully Erna after Carrie reached out to see if he had any unclaimed music lying around that she could use to give the show that "old school" Mistress Carrie vibe.                                         Former WFNX disc jockey Julie Kramer unearths photos of rock 'n' roll royalty                                         What he came up with is an intense instrumental piece titled "War Drums," which by no coincidence runs at 107.3 beats per minute (a nod to WAAF's legendary frequency), and was inspired by Carrie's "war room" at her house, which holds a plethora of military memorabilia from her time as an embedded reporter overseas, and mementos from family members who served.                          In addition to the instrumental track, Carrie dug deep into the archives to revive some iconic voices for the sake of station identification, including Dave Grohl, Steven Tyler, Corey Taylor, Flea and the show's first guest, Shinedown's Brent Smith among so many others. While it might seem mindblowing to have so many of rock's gatekeepers uttering the name of a local voice that we've always held dear, it's really just a representation of how much Carrie has cared for artists and their many endeavors over the years.                          "I've tried really hard to take care of people, and be respectful of artists and what they've needed help with, and to always do what I said I was going to do and hold up my end of the bargain," says Carrie. "Over the years, I've met so many people that have been incredibly generous, and I really wanted to make the trailer sound like my old show, where it made you comfortable. I wanted it to have that historical vibe where people will hear it and go 'okay, there's Mistress Carrie.'"                          While the overall idea of the podcast will focus on rock music as a genre, and give members of the still-reeling WAAF community a place to congregate once again and expose them to new music from great bands, Carrie is excited to shine a light on the many aspects of rock 'n' roll that you may not normally think of, like the plethora of stories archived in the minds of well-traveled roadies or the outside interests of rock stars, like Ivan Moody of Five Finger Death Punch and his CBD product brand, or Ice Nine Kills frontman Spencer Charnas' Kleaver Clothing line. Additionally, she's hoping that it can become somewhat of a travel guide to showcase other things like cool regional liquors and beers, and great places to eat all over the country as well, since the rock and metal community is constantly on the road checking out their favorite bands.                                         Jump back on 'The Big Mattress' with Charles Laquidara at the Wilbur                                         "That's what the goal will be with my podcast and my company. I want to galvanize that community again, and give them a place to go," says Carrie. "I think the audience knows after 22 years on the air at AAF that I'm not going to steer them wrong. I just want to be there to help them discover new music that I know they're going to love, and be there to help them stay connected to the bands they already love, that WAAF was involved in breaking in the first place. I also want my podcast to be about the rock lifestyle. The music is the common thread, but the lifestyle is a massive umbrella that so many people fit under."                          While a lot has changed for Carrie over the last four months, it's still the same voice, the same passion for rock and roll and working with veterans, and the same purple hair. It's just going to be bigger and badder than before.
