Lucy Alexandra Spencer dials in and her voice is crystal clear. She could be sitting a mere socially distant 6 feet away. Instead, she’s by a small medieval town in Austria overlooking the Alps on summer vacation. The former teacher-turned-online tutor takes advantage of exceptional internet connections.
 But when she’s back at her British home in Berkshire, on the outskirts of London, internet speeds are dire enough that Ms. Spencer uses her cellphone as an internet hotspot and carries extra portable Wi-Fi to ensure as little disruption occurs as possible for her online courses teaching hundreds of children at a time. It all amounts to high monthly costs to stay connected in the United Kingdom.
 “It’s a bit mad having so many backups, but being reliable is super important,” she says. “I had two lessons over the whole of lockdown which had to be rescheduled because of connectivity issues.”
 Britain’s internet speeds lag behind those in many smaller, less wealthy nations. According to a report by the European Commission, high-speed broadband in Slovenia and Lithuania eclipses that across Britain. Estonia, with a gross domestic product of $30.7 billion – a fraction of Britain’s 2018 GDP of $2.3 trillion – trumps the U.K. for breadth and speed of online connectivity.
 And Britain’s patchy internet connections both cause and expose inequalities across British society. These have become even more apparent under the COVID-19 lockdown. Owners of land, property, and businesses in rural England and Wales are concerned that poor connectivity could hamper Britain’s economic recovery as the country claws back from its biggest economic plunge in more than 300 years.

Cutting the Wyoming Department of Tourism’s $2 million advertising budget, for example, could cost the state an estimated $15 million in tax revenue from reduced public awareness, according to agency estimates. Eliminating a $1 million program within the Wyoming Department of Health – its Health Innovation Fund – could prevent innovations in preventative care that could have saved the state money long-term.
 “I always thought of them as like the FRAM oil filter expenditures that if you paid for them now, it saves you some money later on,” Rep. Dan Kirkbride, R-Chugwater, said in an interview. “I thought anything you would do to keep senior citizens in their homes instead of sending them to a nursing home or an assisted living facility would save a lot of money, and early childhood development saves us money in the education system.”
 With few concrete numbers and an uncertain economic future amid a declining mineral sector and an increasingly polarized Legislature, most can only speculate how dramatic the long-term economic and social impacts of the cuts will be.
 For example, a $2.75 million cut from the Wyoming Home Services program – which helps keep the state’s senior population out of expensive nursing homes by meeting them where they live – could potentially cost government thousands of dollars more per patient if that reduction continues long-term.
 Cutting those funds from the state budget, AARP Wyoming’s Tom Lacock warned, could make things worse down the road, either by forcing seniors to use more expensive nursing home facilities or deferring preventative care measures, leading to more serious health concerns later on.
 “The great news for policy makers is that, in this case, the least-expensive choice is the choice the public wants,” Lacock said. “You’ve already got the hearts and minds.”
 The problem is that the state – now faced with cutting government to the bare necessities – can no longer afford even that.
 Though Gov. Mark Gordon’s office, which approved the cuts, made them with an emphasis on trying to reduce the impact on public health, safety and law enforcement, initial efforts to transition the state’s balance sheets from red to black will come with ample collateral damage that could extend well beyond the Wyoming Capitol.
 “These budget cuts are going to have way more impacts outside of Cheyenne when you talk about reductions in payments or services the Department of Health runs or for what tourism is able to do,” Gordon’s policy adviser, Renny MacKay, said in an interview.

An Israeli court handed a Jewish settler three life sentences Monday for murdering a Palestinian toddler and his parents in a "hate crime" arson attack on their West Bank home.
 Amiram Ben-Uliel, 25, was sentenced by the court in the town of Lod following his conviction in May for the 2015 killings that stirred international disgust and charges of Israeli laxism.
 He was also found guilty of two counts each of attempted murder and arson, along with conspiracy to commit a hate crime.
 Ben-Uliel threw a firebomb through a window of the Dawabsha family home while they slept in the village of Duma on the occupied West Bank.
 Ahmed Dawabsha, who was four at the time, was severely burned in the attack, which killed his 18-month-old brother Ali, his mother Riham and father Saed.
 The murders shone a spotlight on Jewish extremism and sparked accusations that Israel had not done enough to prevent such violence.
 The court said the murders were "carefully planned and driven by an extremist ideology and racism".
 Ben-Uliel wanted to kill the family "solely because they were Arabs living in Duma, deciding that their death would avenge that of Malachi Rosenfeld", the court said in a statement.
 Rosenfeld was an Israeli shot dead a month earlier by a Palestinian near the West Bank settlement of Shilo.
 Ben-Uliel will spend a minimum of 15 years behind bars with the sentence backdated to his arrest in 2015.
 The court also ordered him to pay nearly one million shekels ($290,000) in compensation.
 Ben-Uliel refused to testify at his trial and his lawyer sought to disqualify the confession and other prosecution evidence, which he said Shin Bet security service interrogators had extracted by force.
 The toddler's grandfather, in court for the sentencing, told journalists that the ruling brought him "no joy".
 It will "not bring back my family", said Hussein Dawabsha.
 In the wake of the attack, Palestinians accused Israel of supporting Jewish extremism, although Israeli leaders were unanimous in condemning "Jewish terrorism".
 Ben-Uliel's legal team and his wife Oriane Ben-Uliel said they would appeal the court's decision.
 "The judges were not looking for justice but wanted to convict my husband at any cost, despite the evidence of his innocence, which we presented in court," she said in a statement.
 In May 2019, another Israeli accepted a plea bargain over his role in the attack, confessing to a racially motivated conspiracy to commit a crime and vandalism.
 The youth had admitted to staking out Duma ahead of the attack with Ben-Uliel, but was said not to have participated in it.
 He has not been named, as he was 17 at the time of the killings and tried as a minor. The young man is to be sentenced Wednesday.

The stalemate over completing pending work on Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers on the congested Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass is continuing, with blacktopping of the two structures not progressing as was expected.
 The filling and blacktopping of the approach road to the Vyttila flyover from the Palarivattom side is another long-pending work. The delay on the part of the Public Works Department (NH wing) in executing the work has given rise to the fear that the deadline to commission the flyover might have to be extended yet again, despite mounting traffic snarls at the two junctions.
 The original deadline to commission the structure at Vyttila expired in May 2019. The Kundannoor flyover’s original deadline was March 2020.

COVID-19 has changed lives forever, but it has really taken a bite out of non- profit organizations' ability to raise much needed funds to help those less fortunate.
 This past weekend a baker's dozen of cyclists took part in Bike 4 United Way, an annual volunteer charity ride, hosted by Ontario Public Service (OPS) employees promoting healthy, active living, that raises awareness for local United Way campaigns across Ontario by visiting them on route.
 The ride has raised more than $330,000 since 2012. This year there will be four ride locations, north, south, east and central. Distances and speeds will vary from 80km to 160km per day. The rides will take place from September 11 to 20 and fundraising will be available up to October 15.
 Funds raised through the ride will help the United Way's network of member agencies and programs ensure hundreds of thousands of Ontarians have access to social services when and where they need it most - in their community.
 The Prince Edward County rides -- held Saturday from Belleville through the north end of The County to Presqu'ile Provincial Park and back to Belleville (107 km), and Sunday from Ameliasburgh to Green Point and back (88 km) -  as of Monday morning had raised $16,089 of the $25,000 goal.
 Patricia Thompson, of Belleville, a learning and development coordinator with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, represented Hastings and Prince Edward during this year's ride.
 This year's Bike 4 United Way will see five separate rides take place with a goal to raise funds for local United Way's in communities across Ontario including: Prince Edward County, Durham Region, Hamilton/Halton, Collingwood, and Northern Manitoulin Island.
 "We're doing it very different this year, in the past there was only one big ride and last year I put up my hand and said I can't do a 150 km ride this year, so I volunteered to do a shorter ride. This year, because we're trying to keep the distance everybody needs to travel down and keep the pods smaller, we have five rides going on around the province," Thompson said.
 "This is a very popular place to ride, everybody wants to go to The County," she said.
 Brian Liu, of Toronto, was participating in his first Bike 4 United Way ride since 2013.
 "It's been a while, but it's all good. We raise as much money as we can for a great cause. This pandemic is very challenging, especially for the organizations who help the folks who really need it. I think that's why in 2013 I did it. Since then I still fundraised but didn't participate in the cycling aspect of it. This year I was like 'OK I don't really have an excuse not to because I have all the gear,' so I basically decided a week ago that I would participate."
 There's a lot of stuff you need to take with you on a 100 km ride.
 "You need to have your repair kit, inner tubes so if you get a flat tire you can just do it on the go, a hand pump, and carbon dioxide cartridges. Realistically, that's what you need, I've had a cable snap on a ride and I had to wait for a bicycle shop, because it's not one of those things you just carry with you," Liu said.
 Jennifer Smith from United Way Hastings Prince Edward said the pandemic has been extremely challenging for the 41 agencies and 62 programs they support from Quinte West to Deseronto and The County to Bancroft.
 "We postponed a couple of our events because of the pandemic, but we've been doing this summer series of drive-thru barbecues, so we're going to kind of culminate our summer series of barbecues with our campaign launch (set for Tuesday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m. at Quinte Exhibition Fairgrounds)," Smith said. "But it also has to be something safe for the community."
 United Way went into "an emergency response mode situation, the moment COVID hit we gathered and said 'What are the next steps, what is this going to look like?' and then it was 'OK we're getting hundreds of calls from seniors who can't get their groceries and the people who normally do that are in isolation.' So we launched a grocery delivery program. Then it was 'What's the next hurdle?' So you kind of evolve that way. So once we had put out most of the fires it was, like, 'OK, what can we do for our community?', so we did the drive-thru barbecues because it was something that we could give back," Smith said.
 "We're actually doing OK in terms of staying busy. We had the money the government gave us that we had to disperse to all the organizations," Smith said. "We still don't have a full understanding of what the campaign is going look like within workplaces. Payroll contributors are the largest contributors to our campaign. So the banks are open and the manufacturers are open, but what do their layoffs look like, which means employees aren't in the building and donating to the campaign. It could be a huge decrease in the money we'd usually receive.
 "It will be interesting and, like every non-profit, we'll see what we can do, but I think our main motivator is the programs that we support need us more now than ever before, because their need doesn't change because of COVID. Whereas some other industries have changed, whether we raise the money or not they need the money no matter what, so that's our motivator," Smith said. "Everybody is just doing the best they can."

A process and business model mindset is exactly what's called for in the education industry, which accounts for more than 6 percent of GDP in the United States. From kindergarten to four-year colleges, educators are struggling with the challenge of delivering value -- content, instruction, and camaraderie -- when the old delivery model has been impaired. The solution won't be found in new software products for remote learning -- versions of those have been around for years, and they won't help students who don't have access to computers or reliable Internet. The solution will come instead from experimentation that combines elements of technology, social innovation, teaching, and collaboration.

I've often wondered how Trump's base could remain so fiercely loyal after all the damage he has done to the country. The answer seems to be that these people are guilty of LUI -- Living Under the Influence. They thought they were electing a President and what they got was a crafty cult leader.
   
 It could happen to anyone and it sort of happened to me when I was in college. My friend and I were taken by a fast-talking bait-and-switch artist at a carnival. The con man and cult leader have much in common. Both are masters of deceit.
   
 Trump has overtaken the Republican party by force. His policies contradict much of what the party once stood for -- fiscal conservatism, a balanced budget, national defense, a strong military, support for our allies. And he even got the religious right to turn a blind eye to his moral transgressions. The Republican party has become the party of Trump.
   
 In an interview with Kseniya Kirillova, the cult expert Steven Hassan said that Trump "displays the features of a typical cult leader -- malignant narcissism; egocentrism; a tendency to believe his own greatness and to exaggerate achievements; constant fantasies of his own power…a lack of empathy; a tendency to sadism; anti-social behavior and lying."
   
 These traits were on full display throughout Trump's Presidency. He admires autocrats and thinks white supremacists are "good people". He has a special affection for Putin and takes his word that Russia did not interfere with our election, though our own intelligence agencies have proven otherwise.
   
 He attacked Gold Star families, trashed the military brass, and remained silent when Putin put a bounty on our soldiers in Afghanistan. At a WWII cemetery in France he dishonored the dead by calling them "suckers".
   
 According to The Fact Checker, Trump has told more than 20,000 lies. Controlling information is his favorite strategy of deceit. The message is driven home by arousing fear and panic. Unfavorable news is dismissed as "fake news" and unpleasant facts are replaced with "alternate facts".
   
 Trump's "malignant narcissism" took a more deadly turn when the pandemic hit. Instead of mobilizing the country to fight the virus, he chose to ignore it -- not because of incompetency as we once thought, but because he simply didn't care about saving lives. All he could think about was how the pandemic would affect his chances of getting re-elected.
   
 In Bob Woodward's recent book, we learn that Trump's downplaying of the pandemic was a willful act of deceit. He knew as early as Feb. 7 that the virus was "deadly stuff", that it was five times more dangerous than the flu and that it could be transmitted through the air.
   
 And yet he continued to mock people who wore masks and he disregarded the CDC's guidelines on social distancing. He held big rallies that endangered the lives of thousands. He urged the states to reopen even as the coronavirus cases kept climbing. He put economics ahead of health because it was a political advantage to do so.
   
 Trump's denial of the science played a role in further dividing the country, and views on the pandemic were influenced by partisan politics. The republicans were more inclined to follow Trump and the democrats to follow the science.
   
 The coronavirus has claimed nearly 200,000 American lives, and a thousand more are dying every day. Many of those people died because of Trump's extreme narcissism. The only question is, how much more damage will Trump do to the people in our country?
   
 John Urquiza was a life-long Republican who lived in New Mexico. The governor, a Trump puppet, said it was safe to go out without a mask and engage in normal social activities. So, having faith in his government, he went to a Karaoke party with a group of friends, caught the virus and died.
   
 John's daughter Kristin said that her father felt betrayed by Trump. She ended with this comment: "My dad was a healthy 65-year old. His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump."
   
 Bait and switch. Trump campaigned as a Republican. He said he would "drain the swamp" in Washington and make America great again. But it never was about the party, or the people, or Washington, or the country. It has always been about nothing but Donald J. Trump.

 While acknowledging that several roads are in a bad state, CSML sources attributed the delay in carrying out repair work to the ongoing drainage work. This occurred because there was shortage of labourers due to COVID curbs. Road restoration work will pick pace once drainage work reaches a satisfactory level, they added.
 With the departments concerned not restoring roads, traffic police personnel had mobilised men and materials and repaired several roads, including Kundannoor Junction, a couple of months ago.
 Meanwhile, the works standing committee chairman of the Kochi Corporation attributed the poor condition of roads to the ongoing strike by contractors, seeking clearing of dues. “I spoke to the Mayor, and she assured that a portion of dues would be settled this week. Repair work will resume after that,” he said.
 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) too is under fire for the shoddy condition of service roads on the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass. Officals in the agency attributed waterlogging due to absence of drains as the reason. “We wrote many times to our headquarters, seeking funds for building drains. A reply is awaited,” they said.

TSA reserves the right to issue a civil penalty to travelers who have guns with them at a checkpoint. A typical first offense for carrying a loaded handgun into a checkpoint is $4,100 and can go as high as $13,669 depending on any mitigating circumstances. This applies to travelers with or without concealed gun carry permits because even though an individual may have a concealed carry permit, it does not allow for a firearm to be carried onto an airplane. The complete list of civil penalties is posted online. If a traveler with a gun is a member of TSA PreCheck™, that individual will lose their TSA PreCheck™ privileges.
 When an individual shows up at a checkpoint with a firearm, the checkpoint lane comes to a standstill until the police resolve the incident. Guns at checkpoints can delay travelers from getting to their gates, TSA officials said.
 Passengers are permitted to travel with firearms in checked baggage if they are properly packaged and declared at their airline ticket counter. Firearms must be unloaded, packed in a hard-sided case, locked, and packed separately from ammunition. Firearm possession laws vary by state and locality.
 TSA has details on how to properly travel with a firearm posted on its website. The TSA reminds travelers that they should also contact their airline as they may have additional requirements for traveling with firearms and ammunition.

The classes taught by the Boise native can be a little chaotic despite an abundance of planning. She prefers to go with the flow and encourages students to ask questions. That can mean she gets behind schedule, but she equates it to eating a balanced diet.
 “It’s more like, ‘Did I eat enough vegetables today? No, but did I eat enough vegetables this week to stay healthy? Yeah,’” she said. “So if it’s all cake one day, we have to get serious the next day. I let it flow with kind of what the kids are ready for. I think if you remain super rigid and you’re like, ‘We have to get through this or else,’ then you lose so many opportunities to have conversations, learn and for kids to ask questions.”
 Hanson cherishes the kind of environment that style of teaching creates – a feeling of community.
 “She’s willing to do anything she can to help kids, academically and personnally,” said CHS principal Jeremiah Johnston. “She forges relationships that are really strong and powerful for our school.”
 Unlikely groups become friends. Students share and grow more. Everyone is ready to stretch and learn. That feeling surpasses any individual memory she has of her career. It’s about the students she’s with. That those students nominated her for the award makes it all the better.
 “The number one reason that it feels good that I got this is that kids notice. I don’t really care about the rest of it,” Hanson said.
 “They’re the ones that are going to matter … I can’t fix the structural, systemic issues that exist, but I can change the way some kids see the world or think about stories or books or feel empowered to write or read more ... I have those kids. They’re what really matters.”

My guide, Chase Soresen, instructed me to put my fly rod in the bottom of the raft and to hang on. We were about to go through some serious whitewater rapids in a 10-mile stretch of what is called The Gorge on the Clark Fork River located in far western Montana. I did as instructed and was glad I obeyed because soon after that our raft entered the rapid.
 The drop came suddenly. It was at least 4 feet to the bottom of that drop where our raft was violently halted by a standing wave higher than the drop. Chase pushed forward on the oars and we lifted over the top of that first wave to get repeatedly wet as successive waves of the same height batted our raft around for about 50 yards before we left that rapid behind and the Clark Fork calmed down enough for me to pick up my fly rod and begin fishing again. A roller-coaster ride for sure and the first of nine more rapids to run that were guaranteed to provide the same thrill if not more than the rapid left behind before we landed at our takeout below the Gorge.
 While not a remote, unchartered canyon like the one I wrote about last week, this particular section of the Clark Fork is wild enough to provide whitewater enthusiasts some real challenges, but it also keeps all but the best boat fishing guides away from the Gorge except during runoff when the rapids are covered by snowmelt and, truth be told, probably not even known to the majority of early season anglers floating through the Gorge. Because the rapids were now very apparent, if not intimidating, this meant the fishing pressure in September would be light. It was the very reason my guide Chase recommended this section as the one to float, even if it resulted in a sudden swim or drenching as we floated throughout the day.

For the Department of Health, 87% of its annual operating budget is channeled not to the bureaucracy of Cheyenne, but to health care providers and hundreds of state employees in communities around the state.
 “When we give those dollars out to providers, local organizations, local businesses, there’s obviously a multiplier effect of those funds, because they have staff, those staffs receive salaries and those salaries go back into the community,” Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Stefan Johannson said in an interview. “When we cut programs, when we cut contracts, when we cut reimbursement rates, there will be a negative multiplier effect on our economic impact.”
 It’s not clear when those effects will be felt, or whether the communities and organizations who rely on those funds will be able to weather them. Ahead of the multi-million dollar cuts seen toward the end of Gov. Matt Mead’s administration, there was an open question among the health care community of whether reductions to Medicaid reimbursement rates could drive some providers out of business or lead them to stop serving Medicaid patients at all.
 While that never came to fruition, Johannson said a similar question is lingering ahead of this year’s round of cuts, particularly given a revenue picture even bleaker than the one lawmakers faced in 2017 and 2018.
 “It’s really hard to say what the tipping point is where we would start to lose providers – whether they go out of business or whether they stop serving the department’s clientele – but we know that every reduction that we make, whether to a contract, a reimbursement rate or a program, we sort of move that risk along,” he said.
 Revenue is a big part of that conversation. Even before the impacts of COVID-19, Johannson said his division was already preparing for reductions prompted by the structural revenue declines in the state’s fossil fuel industry, while agencies like the Department of Transportation – which already faced funding shortfalls in excess of more than $100 million – tried in vain to lobby lawmakers for a means to avert maintenance concerns that would cost the agency even greater sums in the long term.
 While MacKay said that the executive branch is cognizant of the ancillary effects many of the state’s budget reductions could have, history shows that the impacts could be long-lasting and likely more expensive than the cost of the programs meant to prevent them. In the wake of cuts to substance abuse programs in Wyoming’s prisons in early 2017, recidivism rates in Wyoming’s corrections system spiked upward. With this year’s budget cuts leaving the state a choice between a fully staffed prison or drug treatment programs, the state might be facing a similar scenario.
 Especially with an additional 20% of the budget left to cut by this spring.
 “Mental health and substance abuse programs did not take a very large cut in the first round,” said Andi Summerville, the former mayor of Laramie and executive director of the Wyoming Association of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Centers. “You would see that both in the line item for the Department of Health as well as in the budget for the Department of Corrections. What we are concerned about is the longer-term ramifications of even more budget cuts and what that will look like.”
 Though Gordon’s office has set the tone for this year’s budget cuts, it will ultimately be up to state lawmakers to carry the ball over the goal line. History shows that the Wyoming Legislature’s position closely tracks the governor’s position and sometimes even exceeds it.
 With the largest deficit the state has faced and government as small as ever, the space to avert the worst impacts is likely gone. Wyoming’s mineral revenues have all but dissipated, with oil and coal markets facing bleak futures into 2021. Meanwhile, the state’s revenues from investments have slowed significantly and, without substantial changes to its revenue streams, fiscal analysts have warned the state’s savings are set to disappear before the next two-year budget cycle. Those problems cannot be solved around the margins, MacKay said.

But according to data from the medical experts’ presentation to the presidents in August, the antigen tests should be more effective than the PCR tests in driving down the rate of infection.
 That information is based on research by a handful of scientists that included Colorado assistant professor of computer science Daniel Larremore and Michael Mina, an epidemiologist and immunologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.
 In a preprint of their paper published earlier this summer — it had not been peer reviewed at the time — the authors determined that “testing frequency was found to be the primary driver of population-level epidemic control.”
 Frequency, not sensitivity, is the key to containment because of the rate the virus grows once it enters the body.
 Scientists believe that infectiousness occurs when there are approximately one million copies of the virus (per milliliter) in the body, Harmon said.
 But unless a contagious person coughs in your face for 10 minutes, a typical COVID-19 exposure doesn’t instantly produce one million copies — it could be more like 50,000 or 100,000 copies.

CASPER — Even before COVID-19, most state leaders already understood that Wyoming would be unable to cut itself out of its current budget crisis.
 But a review of the state’s first round of proposed budget cuts shows that the state could actually be cutting itself into a worse crisis in the coming months, with even greater reductions in government spending still on the horizon.
 Short-term solutions to reducing state spending, including cuts to preventative care and tourism, could actually cost Wyoming more money in the long run, either by exacerbating already existing gaps in public service or by doing away with services intended to generate money for the state.

“I believe the economy is great because the stock market keeps going up.” Even though the value and amount of money in our pocketbooks go down, we’re convinced.
 “I believe the police do their absolute best under horrible circumstances. Look at ______.” Or the contrary. And, we’ll keep believing whatever no matter what.
 Most of our currently popular assumptions-beliefs are fairly new. In the years when infants generally died before the age of 2, no one had any illusions about the economy. If it put money in your pocket, it was good. If it didn’t ... “Vote the bastards out.” Nor did people see the police as intrinsically good for anything but keeping change from happening and order in the society. If cops bashed heads and caused a few deaths ... too bad. If ... but you get the picture.
 Scourges like COVID-19 came along at regular intervals. Locusts, plague, droughts ... the four horsemen of the Apocalypse swept towns and cities looking for victims, destroying economies, governments, countries. No one expected otherwise.
 We’ve been lucky enough to live in a different age, one where we’ve developed our minds in ways that control huge swaths of our environment and where we’ve become adept at turning our assumptions into rock-solid truths. Perhaps, we’ve become complacent in the process.
 Well, one infectious agent so small that it’s invisible to the human eye has changed everything and thrown a whole bunch of our assumptions-truths-beliefs into a cocked hat.

The stalemate over completing pending work on Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers on the congested Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass is continuing, with blacktopping of the two structures not progressing as was expected.
 The filling and blacktopping of the approach road to the Vyttila flyover from the Palarivattom side is another long-pending work. The delay on the part of the Public Works Department (NH wing) in executing the work has given rise to the fear that the deadline to commission the flyover might have to be extended yet again, despite mounting traffic snarls at the two junctions.
 The original deadline to commission the structure at Vyttila expired in May 2019. The Kundannoor flyover’s original deadline was March 2020.
 Official sources said rainy weather hampered the application of mastic asphalt coating on both the structures. The work is labour-intensive and the compound has to be heated at 200 degree Celsius. It will explode if rainwater falls on the molten material. The filling and tar coating of Vyttila flyover’s approach will be completed in another fortnight. Efforts were under way to complete all work on the structures by October 31, they said.
 Interestingly, mastic asphalt coating is under way atop bridges on the Alappuzha Bypass, although the bypass has not been opened to traffic. Aimed at executing the work despite rainy weather, the contractor has constructed a semi-permanent roofing structure fitted with wheels. This enables it to be easily moved across the bridge.
 It is not a foolproof method to do mastic asphalt works, since rainwater could seep in through the bridge’s gradient. The compound has to be boiled, transported and laid safely, failing which it might affect the durability of the blacktopping work. Not withstanding this, the contracting firms of the two structures have been directed to probe the feasibility of readying such a structure. This might affect the durability of the blacktopping work. The mastic asphalt layer that is pending for the twin flyovers in Kochi will need minimum 20 days. It will be topped with a layer of bituminous macadam.
 Once filled, the approach road to the flyover has to be topped with granular sub-base (GSB), over which wet mix macadam (WMM) and dense bituminous macadam (DBM) have to be laid. Bituminous macadam topping will follow.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Profits from family property sales boosted the personal finances of an Indiana state senator who has given at least $1 million toward her campaign for a congressional seat, according to a published report. Republican Sen. Victoria Spartz claimed only her legislative pay of about $71,000 as earned income last year on disclosure reports, but she and her husband have largely made their money buying, selling, leasing and farming land, the Indianapolis Business Journal reported. Spartz is facing Democrat Christina Hale in a costly campaign for central Indiana’s 5th Congressional District seat in the November election. Spartz won the June primary over 14 other Republican candidates after flooding TV screens and mailboxes with ads. Her money made up more than three-quarters of her campaign funding. Spartz recently told the newspaper without giving details that the money for her congressional campaign came from property sale profits, and that she and her husband decided to invest in the political race after at first intending to buy or build a new house. State and local property records show that Victoria and Jason Spartz have owned several properties over the past 15 years or so and now own least 134 acres of farmland, residential parcels and vacant commercial property in Hamilton County just north of Indianapolis. “Jason and Victoria do not speculate or flip real estate, but actually invest real money in real estate,” said Catherine Seat, Spartz’s campaign manager. “It usually takes a while to get returns in these investments.” Seat said the couple has “worked hard, saved money, and been successful in business. We need more of those skills in Congress.” In one deal, the family owned Spartz Farms last year sold a 34.5-acre property in...

As your editorial mentioned, Donald Trump recently said he is equal to both President FDR and Winston Churchill, comparing his response to the virus to their response to World War II. You quoted FDR's speech saying, "The only thing we have to fear, is fear itself." He followed up that speech by mobilizing the American industrial might to provide the tanks, planes and all other material necessary for the Allies to win the war.
   
 Trump was urged to take a similar action and refused, saying the virus was not HIS responsibility -- it was not an American problem but a state problem.
   
 Churchill gave a good many speeches but in one he told the British: "We will fight on land, in the air, at sea, on the beaches, and we will NEVER surrender." In another, he told them he could promise nothing but "blood, sweat, and tears" and in a third said that if this was the end he wanted the future to say "THIS was their finest hour."
   
 Churchill and Roosevelt gave speeches providing their citizens accurate and up-to-date information as to how the war was going. Neither claimed the war was no big deal or it would just "vanish, like magic" and hid accurate and honest information from their citizens.
   
 If there is a comparison, it might be these were two leaders who are usually considered to have been the Rolls Royce in time of crisis, Trump can only be considered a Ugo.

Facebook will buy REI's so-new-it's-never-been-used Bellevue campus for nearly $368 million, the social media giant announced today.
 The move further consolidates Facebook's Eastside mini-empire in the upscale, multiuse Spring District east of I-405. Before the acquisition of the 400,000-square-foot REI offices, Facebook was already on track to occupy nearly 850,000 square feet in three Spring District buildings.
 The company, which opened its first Puget Sound office in 2010 with three engineers, now employs more than 5,000 local workers in dozens of locations in Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond, placing it neck-and-neck with Google for the title of the area's largest out-of-town tech employer. The Seattle area is home to Facebook's second-largest office footprint, after its Menlo Park headquarters.
 “Our growth over the last decade is a testament to the thriving community and immense talent pool that has welcomed us with open arms," said Nick Raby, Facebook's director of North American real estate, in a statement. "This purchase doubles downs on our investment in Bellevue and our commitment to the Pacific Northwest."
 The deal signals that there is "no single approach" for white-collar employers envisioning the future of office space as work-from-home regimes stretch into their seventh month, said Greg Johnson, the CEO of Spring District developer Wright Runstad & Company.
 REI decided to let its three-building Spring District campus go after the pandemic battered sales, leading the outdoor equipment retailer to conclude that it couldn't afford not to sell the space. The company's work-from-home program also proved to be surprisingly successful, said Ben Steele, REI’s chief customer officer. REI will rely more heavily on remote work and smaller satellite offices.
 Other employers have doubled down on offices. Amazon recently announced it plans to occupy nearly 2.75 million square feet of Bellevue office space by 2025. And for Facebook — which expects half its employees to work remotely by the end of the decade — "the company’s offices are still vitally important to help accommodate anticipated growth and meet the needs of our employees that need or prefer to work from campus," said spokesperson Tracy Clayton.

Three different plan options were developed for the north zone of the Shoshone National Forest. A total of 200 different proposals were considered for wheeled-vehicle use and 32 considered for snow use in the Shoshone National Forest.
 Some of the changes appear only slight on the surface but could lead to elimination or addition of activities.
 Alternative 2 proposes to convert many forest roads to trails open to all wheeled vehicles, while Alternative 3 proposes to convert the same roads to trails, most open only to wheeled vehicles 64-inches wide or less.
 Alternative 1 continues the status quo. Currently there are 882 miles of forest service roads and 36 miles of summer motorized trails (non-over snow vehicle use). There are 349 miles of roads for summer motorized travel and 184 miles of roads have seasonal closures in the north zone of the forest, which contains the Clarks Fork, Greybull and Wapiti ranger districts. No summer motorized trails currently exist in the north zone.
 Alternative 2 stems from public comments made in 2015 and 2016, and Alternative 3 offers changes in response to a Nov. 2017 public meeting.
 Road to trail
 Both Alternative 2 and 3 would increase seasonal trail restrictions, with Alternative 2 putting some form of restrictions on 80% of all trails, up from the current 27%.
 Alternative 2 would decrease system roads by 16% and increase trails by 449%, resulting in a small increase in total routes. In the north zone, this would include an addition of 6 miles of small spur roads to allow legal access to dispersed campsites. Mark Foster, forest environmental coordinator, said most of the road changes will be occurring in the Washakie and Wind River districts.
 It would reduce to 338 miles of summer motorized roads in the north zone. From this total, 13 more miles would face seasonal closures. A total of 4 miles of road would be decommissioned and 10 miles of new summer motorized trails would be added.
 “To address loop and youth riding opportunities that (the public) brought forward a couple years ago,” Eickhoff said.
 Joy Bannon, policy director for the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, said her organization is analyzing the plan and takes into strong consideration any road changes that could affect fish and wildlife, with a specific focus on impacts to migration corridors and hunters.
 “Looking at whether there are more concerns with particular streams, trails becoming more like a road,” she said.
 She said the WWF supports motorized access on existing roads and trails as it generally benefits hunters. Her organization determines the benefits of new access on a case-by-case basis.
 A total of 139 miles of roads would be converted to trails for all vehicles, while 3.45 miles of these would be restricted to vehicles with wheelbases 64 inches wide or less – generally ATVs and snowmobiles.
 Foster said when a road is converted to a trail it receives less maintenance, but otherwise stays the same. He said these decisions were made as a result of fiscal feasibility rather than traffic volumes, and removing these costs saves the Forest Service money, allowing it to collaborate with other entities like Wyoming State Parks and Trails, and apply for grants for surface upkeep.
 Liz Rose, Wyoming field coordinator for Trout Unlimited, has concerns the travel management plan is dependent on nothing more than fiscal concerns for the decisions being considered, and is putting too much dependence on outside organizations for help. She also expressed disappointment there were no plans set for improved signage or enforcement efforts.
 “It just seems there wasn’t as thorough of analysis as to the impacts to wetlands and riparian areas,” she said. “It just seems it’s setting up for a bunch of executive orders.”
 Bannon said traditionally when a road becomes a trail, it reduces travel and positively impacts wildlife.
 Alternative 3 would decrease roads by 18% and increase trails by 440%, resulting in a .17% decrease in total routes. In the north zone, this plan would add 19 miles of motorized trails but reduce system roads by 26 miles, and only add 3 miles of spurs, with 3 miles of roads decommissioned.
 Alternatives 2 and 3 would both decrease total road maintenance.
 Snow travel
 Under Alternative 2, The Forest Service will take steps to recognize an official over-snow vehicle use season for the north zone of the forest, which would run from Nov. 1-May 31. This range was determined through the use of 16 years of historical data. FS staff would retain the right to adjust open and close dates.
 “The Forest believes this approach will provide opportunities for over-snow vehicle use recreation while protecting forest resources,” the assessment states.
 Bert Miller, president of the Cody Country Snowmobile Association, said they would like to see the ending of this season range pushed back 15-30 days into June, as there are high altitude locales off the Beartooth Highway that hold substantial depths of snow through the end of July on high moisture years. He cautions against becoming too reliant on historical numbers for openings and closures as real-time snow levels can vary widely at almost any time.
 Currently, there are 27 miles of groomed OSV trails and 31 miles ungroomed over 266 square miles.
 Alternative 3 does not identify open and closure dates, but would rely on special orders and the personal responsibility of Forest users to make the correct decisions as far as the timing of their OSV use.

Smarting from the heavy defeat inflicted by Twenty20, the apolitical corporate-backed charity outfit, that swept into power in Kizhakkambalam panchayat in the last local body polls, mainstream political parties are pulling out all the stops to reverse the fortune in the forthcoming elections.
 The Congress, having ceded power five years ago, has fired the first salvo, accusing Twenty20 of rigging electoral rolls, which the latter has swatted aside as the desperation of an already defeated rival.
 Notwithstanding its confidence of winning at least 12 out of the 19 wards in the panchayat even if the United Democratic Front (UDF) were to go it alone, the local Congress leadership remains open to potential tie-ups, even with fierce rival CPI(M), to defeat the common nemesis. “We are open to joining hands with any democratic force other than communal outfits like the BJP and the SDPI,” said Elias Karipra, president of the Kizhakkambalam Assembly constituency of the Congress. He spoke of how the victorious UDF candidate, Benny Behanan, trailed by just around 1,300 votes in the panchayat despite Twenty20 having supported the LDF candidate, Innocent, in the Chalakudy Parliament constituency in the last general elections.

PENDER COUNTY, N.C. (WECT) - Two years ago, Hurricane Florence made landfall in Wrightsville Beach leaving devastation across the Carolinas.Since the storm, Wilmington Area Rebuilding Ministry, Inc. (WARM) has helped more than 180 families with home repairs. But there are still more than 60 families who need help.Vernon and Loretta Gore’s home of 47 years was flooded during Florence. The couple and their foster child evacuated to Raleigh for a week and when they returned, they were devastated to find their home has nearly been destroyed.They stayed with family in Pender County for a month after the storm. The storm had damaged their roof which in result, caused water damaged to the floors and windows. Mold had grown on their bedroom furniture. Loretta developed asthma because of the condition her home was in.She then applied to WARM to receive some help. Since then, her roof and ceiling have been repaired, but she is still waiting to get the floors, windows, and some pipework done on the house.Despite going through so much in the past few years, the Gores are grateful for the help they’ve received.WARM is hosting a fundraiser to help the Gores with the much-needed repairs.

Backup catcher Cam Gallagher can officially add soothsayer to his resume. His cosmic understanding of the baseball gods proved spot-on. Royals ace and teammate Brad Keller concurred.
   
 Following a frustrating outing in Cleveland last week in which Keller executed his game plan almost exactly, he walked away with a loss and a bitter taste in his mouth. Gallagher assured the right-hander that things have a way of evening out in baseball.
   
 Sure enough, Keller threw the first shutout of his big-league career and his second complete game as the Royals pounded the Pittsburgh Pirates 11-0 to sweep the weekend series at Kauffman Stadium and extend their season-best winning streak to a six games entering an off-day Monday.
   
 Keller (4-2) allowed five hits -- just one for extra-bases -- and one walk in nine innings. He struck out just two and recorded his fourth quality start in seven appearances this summer.
   
 "That last start was pretty so you try to clear the mind and go into this one with a fresh outlook," Keller said. "Like Cam said, the baseball gods came around."
   
 The Royals (20-28) tallied 22 runs in the three-game set and have now scored 44 during their six-game winning streak.
   
 The Royals' pitching staff has now thrown two shutouts in a five-day span, and Keller largely cruised through this one with a season-high 111 pitches. Opponents have batted .152 against him at Kauffman stadium, where he is 3-0 with a 0.33 ERA (one earned run in 27 innings) in four starts this season.
   
 "He was cruising the whole day," catcher Salvador Perez said. "When he's going like that, it's easy to catch him. Wherever I put my glove, he's going to throw a slider or fastball there. ... He was amazing today."
   
 Keller rebounded nicely after a highly frustrating outing in his previous start -- he allowed five runs (four earned) on eight hits, all singles, in a loss at Cleveland Sept. 7. He succeeded in getting weak contact and ground balls that day, but those balls too often found openings and left him stewing.
   
 Keller came back with a similar approach Sunday. He worked quickly, threw a high volume of strikes (73 of 111 pitches) and forced the Pirates to put the ball in play as he relegated the KC bullpen corps to spectators.
   
 "Mike came and talked to me and was like, 'I'm going to cap you at a certain pitch limit,'" Keller said, referring to manager Mike Matheny. "I was like, 'It doesn't matter to me. I want to go out there and get the (last) three outs, do it for the boys in the bullpen, do it for the team.' That was mainly what it was about."
   
 The cap was supposed to be 110 pitches. After the game, Matheny informed Keller that he'd let him throw one extra.
   
 Keller responded, "Sorry."
   
 Matheny didn't sound like a man in need of an apology.
   
 "It's fun to watch," Matheny said. "This complete-game shutout is a big deal for our pitchers. Given the opportunity that he was as efficient as he was, I think it sends a message to the rest of the guys, too. That's the kind of pitching I know they want to have on a consistent basis. It was a great job by Brad."
   
 The Royals' offense got going so fast that by the time Perez batted in the fifth inning, he'd already recorded a three-hit game with a home run and two RBIs.
   
 Hunter Dozier had a home run and three hits and Maikel Franco had three hits and scored twice.
   
 The Royals bashed their way to 10 runs by the end of the third inning, and they didn't even score in the second.
   
 They grabbed a four-run advantage in the first with just two hits. Pirates pitcher Chad Kuhl walked three in the first and gave up an RBI single to Franco and RBI groundout to Alex Gordon and threw a wild pitch that seemed to cross up catcher John Ryan Murphy.
   
 Murphy didn't get his glove on it before it hit home plate umpire Jeremie Rehak in the mask and ricocheted toward the first base dugout. Murphy lost track of the ball, allowing Franco to score from third and Dozier to score all the way from second.
   
 In the third inning, Perez started the six-run gut-punch that ultimately put the Pirates on the ropes for the rest of the afternoon. He blasted Kuhl's first pitch of the inning 440 feet to left-center field for a solo homer that gave the Royals a 5-0 lead.
   
 Each of the next three batters and six of seven reached base. The Royals scored on back-to-back bases-loaded walks by Nick Heath and Nicky Lopez, as well as a two-run single by Whit Merrifield and a broken-bat RBI single by Perez in his second at-bat of the inning. Dozier added a solo homer in the sixth.
   
 "Hitting is contagious," Dozier said. "Whit does what he does. Mondi is swinging the bat well right now. Getting Salvy back in the lineup. Franco has been on a tear. It's contagious.
   
 "Once one guy gets hot, it seems like another guys gets hot. The line just keeps moving. With out pitchers, the way they've been pitching it, we don't have to get too many runs across right now. It's fun to see our offense kind of explode."

Severely potholed roads in the city are giving a nightmarish experience to motorists, with the Kochi Corporation, Public Works Department (PWD), and Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) not taking proactive steps to repair them.
 Parts of the Kundannoor-Pettah NH corridor are in a shoddy state, although the PWD (NH Wing) claimed that it had been repairing the stretch through patch work and paving of concrete blocks.
 Similar is the case with arterial roads. Motorists are often caught unawares by potholes dotting Banerjee Road and Park Avenue Road. Officials of the PWD (Roads Wing) blamed CSML for the state of affairs.
 While acknowledging that several roads are in a bad state, CSML sources attributed the delay in carrying out repair work to the ongoing drainage work. This occurred because there was shortage of labourers due to COVID curbs. Road restoration work will pick pace once drainage work reaches a satisfactory level, they added.
 With the departments concerned not restoring roads, traffic police personnel had mobilised men and materials and repaired several roads, including Kundannoor Junction, a couple of months ago.
 Meanwhile, the works standing committee chairman of the Kochi Corporation attributed the poor condition of roads to the ongoing strike by contractors, seeking clearing of dues. “I spoke to the Mayor, and she assured that a portion of dues would be settled this week. Repair work will resume after that,” he said.
 The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) too is under fire for the shoddy condition of service roads on the Edappally-Aroor NH Bypass. Officals in the agency attributed waterlogging due to absence of drains as the reason. “We wrote many times to our headquarters, seeking funds for building drains. A reply is awaited,” they said.

“In accordance with its safety protocols Stillwater Public Schools has cancelled all athletic and extracurricular events from September 13-19.
 “Payne County is currently designated in the Red Level based on the Oklahoma State Department of Education’s School Safety Protocols with an average of 58.17 daily new cases per 100,000 people. Health officials have indicated much concern about the spread of coronavirus in the Stillwater community and recommend the community continue to make efforts to bring infection rates down to allow for safe participation in athletics and extracurricular activities.
 “Stillwater Athletics will work to reschedule district games, but some non- district games, including the football game against Bixby, are not likely to be rescheduled.”
 The football game that was set for Pioneer Stadium is just one of several athletic competitions to be canceled this week. It was the most anticipated by fans and media around the state, but other events are affected.
 That includes Monday’s SHS softball game at home against Choctaw. The Lady Pioneers are riding a six-game winning streak and were set to play three 6A district games this week, which included a doubleheader at Bartlesville on Tuesday, but none of those will be played this week.
 Those district games could be rescheduled because they do have postseason implications. No rescheduled date has been announced yet.
 “We will be working to reschedule those district games,” Barnard said. “Maybe there are nondistrict games that we have to cancel in order to get those district games rescheduled. We’ll put a high priority on those district games.”

Wilder, though, bemoaned United’s dismal beginning that had them 2-0 behind six minutes in. “To recover from as poor a start as I can remember here against Wolves it was always going to be a tough ask,” he said. “For 85 minutes it is nip and tuck, but it isn’t an 85 minute game is it? We have to move on. It hurts, of course it does, we didn’t want to get off to this start but the thing we have learned in the Premier League is that you have to get over disappointment quickly.”

LARAMIE (WNE) – The University of Wyoming is planning to reopen to in-person classes and release on-campus students from shelter-in-place orders next week, as the coronavirus’s presence on campus appears to have tempered.
 The number of active cases among students, both on and off campus, has fallen in recent days, and the school hasn’t confirmed a new case among students since last Tuesday. Last week, UW President Ed Seidel paused the school’s phased reopening plan – through which first-time students returned for in- person classes last week and older students would begin in late September – after the university confirmed seven cases within a 24-hour period. The trigger point for the pause was five.
 The stay was in effect until Wednesday afternoon, when Seidel announced he was extending it until Monday. Since the pause was announced, all in-person learning has been canceled and students in the dorms have been unable to leave save to socialize among their neighbors.

 After completing work in a house, Ms. Alima was on her way to another house on Narayanaswamy Street when she stepped on a slushy surface beneath which a live electric cable was lying exposed. She was instantly electrocuted and fell to the ground.
 Residents and passersby attempted to resuscitate her. On failing to do so, they called an ambulance, and informed the Pulianthope police. She was rushed to the Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital, where the doctors declared her “brought dead.”
 The body was sent for post-mortem examination.
 A senior police officer in Pulianthope said, “The cause of death is electric shock. A case has been registered under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code for unnatural death. Further investigation is on with officials of civic departments (responsible for the negligence).”

As the United Kingdom claws back from its biggest economic plunge in more than 300 years due to the country’s pandemic lockdown, many in rural England and Wales are concerned that poor internet connectivity could hamper Britain’s recovery.
 Britain’s internet speeds lag behind those in many smaller, less wealthy nations. According to a report by the European Commission, high-speed broadband in Slovenia and Lithuania eclipses that across Britain. Estonia, with a gross domestic product of $30.7 billion – a fraction of Britain’s 2018 GDP of $2.3 trillion – trumps the U.K. for breadth and speed of online connectivity.
 Samuel Bright, an editor for a digital startup magazine, previously lived in London but returned back to his hometown of Huddersfield during the lockdown. He says connectivity in towns and cities in northern England isn’t so different until you step beyond central areas. “When you venture into more remote areas, it’s like stepping into a time machine – you’re effectively cut off from the outside world.”
 He worries poor connectivity has compounded isolation and depression for rural Britons, both old and young. “Ironically, they are exactly the same people who’ve been saddled for decades with poor transport links, crumbling infrastructure, and dying industries.”

Then began the process of finding the truth in her performance, in order to deliver the very resonant feelings of frustration and anger that come with being a Black woman in America. But as Mosaku had conditioned herself to put on a bright smile and not let her passionate feelings show, a deeper introspection was necessary to bring them back to the surface. "The conversations we had to have about Ruby, about the rage and the disappointments, it brought up a lot of stuff for me," the actor says. "I had to dig deep and explore a lot of things that I really stuffed down."
 One of the most difficult moments for Ruby occurs midway through the season. In the fifth episode, "Strange Case," she gets to experience life as a white woman when the mysterious William (Jordan Patrick Smith) drugs her with a potion that transforms her into one. At first, Ruby is horrified by the experience, especially when the magic wears off: the white woman's flesh and blood rips and sheds to reveal Ruby's body underneath. However, Ruby makes chooses to inhabit that body further in order to benefit from her shell's white privilege, a decision Mosaku felt somewhat "betrayed" by. "I struggled with that decision she makes," she explains. "I understand why, but I really feel betrayed by it. It's not a thought I would entertain myself."  
 She continues, "Ruby says, 'the problem is being interrupted' because being a woman is not a problem. It's being in a patriarchal society that's the problem. Being Black isn't a problem--it's being in a white supremacist world. I love myself, I love my skin, and I love my history. I'm grateful for who I am, grateful for the people who made me, my ancestors, and I wouldn't change a thing."
