Monetary policy is a practice aimed at influencing economy-related decisions and economic progress in order to achieve goals such as economic growth, employment growth and price stability. The aim of the CBRT is to ensure price stability, as with many central banks around the world. In order to achieve this goal, it independently determines and implements monetary policy instruments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

It is true that Washington’s retreat from the international arena pushed the Gulf states closer to Israel. At the same time, those countries are concerned that Trump won’t get reelected in November.

The Obama administration dealt the second blow during the Arab revolts in the early 2010s. Although Obama kept Israel at arm’s length and attempted a rapprochement with Iran, he allowed the Gulf states to crush democratic revolutions and contributed to the rise of fresh failed states in Syria, Libya and Yemen. This new wave of violence in the Arab world has entailed fresh pain – in comparison to which the Palestinian question seems to have faded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

Inflation occurs for two main reasons – an increase in demand or costs. Moving forward from the demand-interest example, let us assume that interest rates are falling. When the consumer accesses low-interest loans more easily, the demand for goods increases. Demand growth leads to price growth and therefore inflation.

On the inflation side, supply-side pressures are not our only problem. At the same time, rapid demand growth, exchange rate variability and backward indexing complicate this process. Of course, we all demand low interest and competitive exchange rates. But if we cannot control inflation and if we provide extremely low-interest loans, the consumer can use loans to buy foreign currency.

The unemployed in Turkey are those who have sought to find a job in the last four weeks and could not find one. The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed people divided by the total workforce.

Inflation occurs for two main reasons – an increase in demand or costs. Moving forward from the demand-interest example, let us assume that interest rates are falling. When the consumer accesses low-interest loans more easily, the demand for goods increases. Demand growth leads to price growth and therefore inflation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

On the inflation side, supply-side pressures are not our only problem. At the same time, rapid demand growth, exchange rate variability and backward indexing complicate this process. Of course, we all demand low interest and competitive exchange rates. But if we cannot control inflation and if we provide extremely low-interest loans, the consumer can use loans to buy foreign currency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

When calculating GDP, the market sale price of final goods is taken into account. In other words, values such as various cost items and labor are not used in the calculation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             *[ASX]: Australian Stock Exchange

The current process, however, obviously serves Israel’s interests at the expense of the Palestinian people and, more broadly, all Arabs. It is no less clear that the Trump administration’s latest move will not bring new order, peace or stability to the region. If anything, it is set to deepen divisions and fuel rivalries.

The Obama administration dealt the second blow during the Arab revolts in the early 2010s. Although Obama kept Israel at arm’s length and attempted a rapprochement with Iran, he allowed the Gulf states to crush democratic revolutions and contributed to the rise of fresh failed states in Syria, Libya and Yemen. This new wave of violence in the Arab world has entailed fresh pain – in comparison to which the Palestinian question seems to have faded.
