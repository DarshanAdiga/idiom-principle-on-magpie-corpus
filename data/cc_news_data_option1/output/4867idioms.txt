Bloomberg) -- As Hong Kong battles a new wave of coronavirus infections with yet another round of social restrictions, a sense of fatigue with the confusing and inconsistent nature of the city’s pandemic response is setting in among business-owners and residents.


  Though the Asian financial center has thus far been relatively unscathed -- total Covid-19 cases amounting to just 81 cases per 100,000 people out of a densely packed 7 million population -- the city has encountered more waves than most other places and is entering its fourth round of stop-start restrictions.


  “Hong Kong has undoubtedly been lucky with the pandemic so far. What has been missing is a clear, public road map as to how and when restrictions will be implemented and when the rules will be relaxed,” said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.


  The coronavirus has been an unpredictable and volatile foe, warranting nimble and quick-changing reaction from governments. But as the pandemic approaches its first anniversary, Hong Kong’s residents and business-owners are increasingly looking to the structured response systems in place in regional neighbors like New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore in envy.


  The former British colony’s comparatively erratic response is deepening the crisis in an economy already on its knees from months of restive street protests followed by the pandemic, they say.


  The sharp rise in new local cases in the past week is linked to social dancing venues, yet officials have announced a closure of bars, karaoke rooms and massage parlors. Like in previous rounds, the restrictions are imposed for a week or two at a time, leaving business-owners in a state of suspended animation and unable to plan long term.


  “At the moment, I’m waiting for Friday afternoon to see if they’re closing more classrooms,” said Stephanie Holding, a mother of three sons who runs her own business from home. She would rather see a system that lets people “know what’s affected and when,” she said.


  Hong Kong says it takes a flexible “suppress and lift” approach to virus restrictions based on the advice of medical advisers. But other “high risk” businesses like gyms and restaurants don’t know when they’ll be asked to close, and only some are required to enforce a little-used health-code app before allowing patrons in. To add to the confusion, schooling and childcare services for younger kids were also shut down again earlier this month -- but because of an outbreak of the common cold and not Covid-19.


  In other places with different phases or alert levels that determine what restrictions are activated at what stage of infection, “we know we’ve reached this level and this is what will take place next,” said Allan Zeman, an economic adviser to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and Chairman of Lan Kwai Fong Group, a major landlord in the city’s bar district. “You have a sense of ‘this is what we need to do to get back to zero,’ rather than just ad-hoc decision making week by week.”


  ‘Zero Scientific Basis’


  The government defends its approach by saying that the public alert level systems employed elsewhere don’t work in Hong Kong. Lam Ching Choi, a medical doctor and a member of the chief executive’s advisory Executive Council, said that he did not believe that a “very structured approach” was right for what he touts as “the most free economy in the world.”


  Instead, Lam likened the Hong Kong approach to “precision medicine,” and said that the focus was on maintaining normality as far as possible rather than turning to blanket lockdowns. “So when you walk in our city, you don’t really feel like Covid-19 is going on, apart from wearing masks.”


  The risk is that this “precision” is seen as arbitrary by businesses: with no current virus clusters directly linked to the bar industry, the latest ruling for bars to shut down has “zero scientific basis,” said David McEwan, the owner of Bobby’s Rabble, a bar in the Central district.


  Though bars and nightclubs are generally regarded as high-risk locations in every country, businesses say they lack understanding over the level at which they’ll be singled out and what circumstances would allow them to re-open.


  “This is one of the busiest times of the year and we have no idea if it’s a week or will there be a extension every week like last time,” said Ravi Beryar, managing director of Liquid Management Ltd, which operates two nightlife venues in Hong Kong’s main bar districts.


  Beryar and others say they would like a more methodical and transparent approach akin to that of other countries in the Asia Pacific region who have been among the most successful in the world in containing the spread of Covid-19. New Zealand, for example, introduced a four-tier alert system near the beginning of the pandemic, and has been widely lauded for its clarity in communicating the system to its citizens. Singapore in May announced a three- phase roadmap for the gradual resumption of normal life.


  South Korea, which has been reporting its highest number of new cases in eight months, has also been continuously enforcing and relaxing social restrictions in response to case numbers. However, its strategy is dictated by a five-step system whereby certain measures are triggered when cases reach a certain threshold. Currently the country is in level 2 of restrictions, meaning restaurants can only operate limited hours and high-risk facilities are closed.


  New Zealand tops Bloomberg’s Covid Resilience Ranking, which assess countries’ success in controlling the coronavirus with minimal disruptions to everyday life. South Korea ranks fourth, while Singapore comes in at 11th, one spot ahead of Hong Kong.


  “While the real world is inevitably more messy than a lab, having a clear structure that is above politics help to foster trust in the response strategies,” said CUHK’s Thomas.


  School Closures Round Three


  Another group of people frustrated with Hong Kong’s response are parents, who have endured up to three rounds of school closures this year. The latest, the shutting down of only nurseries and kindergartens -- followed by primary one to three -- was triggered by an outbreak of upper respiratory tract infections, for example, and not the novel coronavirus.


  “In other countries, they are keeping schools open at all costs,” said Rosheen Rodwell, a mother of three children who said that communications from the government has been lacking in terms of whether they are prioritizing schools. “People are prepared to get on board and make sacrifices if they understand why.”


  Lam, the government adviser, clarified that the overall strategy is now to keep schools open, having learned from epidemiological studies from around the world that it’s “relatively safe” to do so. The recent closure of kindergartens, he said, was necessary as upper respiratory tract infections are indistinguishable from Covid-19 without testing, and the plan is to open them again as soon as possible.


  David Heymann, an infectious diseases expert at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said that Hong Kong still has a far higher capacity for contact-tracing and cluster-busting than many other countries. “They’re actually finding where transmission is occurring, they are shutting it down and then they are cautiously re-opening it again to see whether or not transmission increases.”


  As pandemic fatigue grows across the world, people need more information as the cycle repeats. “Transparency is the most important. If the governments are being transparent as to why they are closing down then yes, people will better understand,” he said.

Delays in vaccine distribution or widespread refusal to be vaccinated would allow the virus to continue to circulate longer and delay the development of herd immunity, which occurs when enough people in a population have some form of protection that prevents the easy spread of a disease.


  "To be certain that the world will be back to normal by mid-next year because a vaccine is available is an aggressive assumption," said David Albrycht, chief investment officer at Newfleet Asset Management.


  "There's a light at the end of the tunnel but we're not sure how long that the tunnel is going to be," he said, citing uncertainties including whether a vaccine will be free or covered by insurance plans, its rollout and its public acceptance rate.


  Citi Research wrote in a note on Monday that herd immunity would not form until late 2021, boosting global Gross Domestic Product growth by only 0.7per cent next year compared with an estimated 3per cent gain in 2022 as vaccination rates rise.

Corsairs, filibusters, swashbucklers, buccaneers, renegades: the rich lexicon of piracy in our vocabulary of rebellion attests the role they have long played in the collective imagination. But there is a complex history from which they sprang on onto the global stage. The rise of the pirate as a dangerously desirable figure is intimately linked to the maritime expansion conducted by several European nations in the early modern period, that coalesced into the creation of Empires and colonies through which European powers came to dominate world history by the 19th century. This module reads against the grain of those dominant narratives of colonialism as world-making by focusing on the pirate as an interruptive force, who derails the movement of peoples, goods, ideas, and laws across the maritime routes linking the Atlantic and Indian Ocean worlds. Important tools in the module will be the reading practices of postcolonial theory, which will teach us to extract and assess this alternative history of the post/colonial pirate.

JEFFERSON — In the search to staff the cleaning crew for East Elementary School, Jefferson school officials tried to overturn every stone, with announcements online, on traditional media, and in community forums.


  However, when those efforts failed to turn up replacements for two cleaners who recently retired and one who had accepted a new job, officials eventually had to turn to a contracted cleaning service.


  The Jefferson school board acted Monday night to approve a contract with Clean Power LLC to provide cleaning services for East Elementary School at a cost of $5,557 per month.


  Clean Power was one of three companies to submit bids for the project, to the same specifications.


  Also submitting bids were Environment Council of Madison/Milwaukee and Kleenmark of Madison.


  “All three are great companies with a reputation of doing great work,” said Tim Graffin, buildings and grounds supervisor for the Jefferson schools. He and Laura Peachey, director of business services for the district, both interviewed all of the companies that submitted bids.


  Graffin recommended that the board approve the low bid from Clean Power, noting that the company would be following Jefferson school district cleaning protocols to the letter.


  Asked whether the cleaning contract was expected to continue into the future, or just to get the district through this shortage in personnel, Graffin said that the contract runs month-by-month, rather than requiring a long-term commitment, and the district will see how it goes before making any big decisions about the future.


  Jefferson schools Superintendent Mark Rollefson said that the Jefferson schools have had a tradition of seeking out local applicants for jobs rather than turning to contractors, so as not to take away valuable, family- supporting jobs from the local community.


  The district is also sensitive to the danger hiring contractors can present in terms of undercutting the wages of local workers, the superintendent said.


  However, with an aging workforce, a spate of retirements, and no one stepping forward to fill these jobs despite the district’s efforts, the district had to move on to fill this role as it could.


  “With the COVID-19 pandemic going on, we have a greater responsibility right now than ever to assure our sanitation is up to the level that’s necessary,” Rollefson said. “We can’t have gaps right now.”


  Officials noted that Jefferson Middle School is right on the cusp of needing additional cleaning staff as well, so the district went ahead and got a bid for that building too, though hiring contracted cleaning services for the middle school is not yet recommended.


  In other business, the board approved the new elementary level Chromebook handbook which was necessitated by the COVID-19 related closures that have led to the occasional transition of classrooms, schools or the entire district to virtual learning.


  Therefore, even elementary students were placed in the position to take their Chromebooks home on a regular basis.


  Finally, the board went into closed session to discuss administrative contract(s) for 2021-22.


  No action was expected to come out of the closed session of the meeting.

Idahoans who made between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty limit could get insurance on the state exchange, with most of the cost covered by federal income tax credits in most cases. This left some low-income earners in a gap: They didn't make enough to qualify for subsidized insurance on the exchange but they couldn't sign up for Medicaid since Idaho hadn't expanded Medicaid coverage to the able-bodied poor, which is what the Affordable Care Act had originally envisioned all states would do.


  State lawmakers refused for six years to address the gap population. Volunteers led by the grassroots organization Reclaim Idaho, along with some paid organizers, in 2018 gathered tens of thousands of signatures from registered Idaho voters to get expansion on the ballot as a legal policy mandate.


  When voters approved Medicaid expansion, it was the first policy that Idaho voters had directly approved in over a decade. (Several policies had been rejected or repealed by initiatives in that time, according to the Secretary of State's office.)

In particular, Jones’ listing of men and guns at Fort Petites Coquilles—especially when this intelligence was seemingly confirmed by two fishermen the British subsequently captured at the mouth of Bayou Bienvenue—convinced the English admiral that the shorter route (past the Rigolets and across Lake Pontchartrain to New Orleans’ back door) could not be forced.

  If the plan is approved as early as mid-December, spending can be set aside for the sea-based missile interceptor platform in the fiscal 2021 budget to be drafted by year-end, Kyodo said Saturday, citing government sources it didn’t identify. The estimated cost for the Aegis-equipped destroyers would be over 500 billion yen ($4.8 billion), it reported.


  Japan sees the batteries as one protection from the growing missile threats of China and North Korea -- with the latter having test-fired rockets over Japanese territory. In June, then-Defense Minister Taro Kono announced that the deployment of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s Aegis Ashore missile defense system, with an estimated price tag of $5 billion, would be canceled due to cost and safety concerns.


  Kono’s replacement, Nobuo Kishi, said in October the government was considering a plan to install the components of the system on a mobile platform at sea. He also discussed options for the missile interceptor system that month with former U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.


  There were plans earlier to deploy two onshore batteries in the prefectures of Yamaguchi and Akita, at either end of Japan’s main island of Honshu. Residents in both locations protested. Some argued the batteries could make them targets of any strike, and that booster stages from the interceptors could fall in their area, posing a risk for residents.


  Since 2019, North Korea has tested new short-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to anywhere in South Korea and avoid U.S. interceptors.


  North Korea launched two missiles over Hokkaido to the north in 2017. The country considers Japan its mortal enemy and has hundreds of missiles that potentially can strike all parts of the country.


  Japan’s current missile-defense system relies on upper-tier interception by Aegis-equipped destroyers and lower altitude missiles being shot down by Patriot PAC-3 interceptors.


  The ruling the Liberal Democratic Party has also proposed considering missile systems that would allow the country to preemptively hit enemy rockets before they leave the pad, seeing this as a defensive move.

Quizá ya sea momento que nos empiece a preocupar la terquedad del presidente de México en no querer reconocer el triunfo del demócrata Joe Biden en las pasadas elecciones presidenciales de Los Estados Unidos de América del Norte, siendo que ya hasta el propio Donald Trump ha dado señales en el sentido de estar dispuesto a renunciar al poder. De modo que, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) se está quedando solo en esa irracional postura que seguramente no tiene nada contento a quien el próximo 20 de enero protestará como el presidente número 46 de la Casa Blanca y con quien tendrá que interactuar como vecinos y socios comerciales durante los próximos cuatro años.


  Han transcurrido casi 25 días partiendo de aquel martes de la elección, y no se entiende desde ningún punto de vista la negativa de López a dirigir un mínimo saludo y/o felicitación a Biden, aún y cuando el propio presidente electo del país vecino, en su momento, buscó los medios para tener ese acercamiento a través de su equipo de trabajo recibiendo como repuesta un palmo de narices de la diplomacia mexicana bajo el argumento de que el presidente López Obrador felicitaría al triunfador sólo hasta que el proceso electoral haya llegado a su término con la respectiva declaratoria oficial.


  Brasil, Rusia y México son hasta hoy los únicos países que se han negado a emitir parabienes al ex vicepresidente de la Unión Americana y virtual ganador de la elección.


  Jaír Bolsonaro, quien es llamado “el Trump” de los trópicos”, -por su estilo populista y desenfadado-, no ha querido felicitar a Biden.


  De hecho, ha trascendido que su negativa a reconocer la victoria del candidato demócrata tiene que ver con sus hijos — que como los vástagos de Trump tienen un papel en la escena política — y parecen estar activamente incómodos con el resultado de las elecciones de Estados Unidos. Sin menoscabo de que el mandatario brasileño había expresado con anterioridad su simpatía hacia Trump y su deseo que permaneciera cuatro años más en la Casa Blanca.


  La excusa del presidente de la Federación Rusa, Vladimir Putin, para no felicitar a Biden es similar a la de México en el sentido de esperar la declaratoria oficial. Sin embargo, hasta cierto punto se entiende que al mandatario de aquella nación europea no le corra prisa por hacerlo toda vez que como él mismo lo declaró hace un par de días, “No se puede arruinar una mala relación. Ya está arruinada”, dijo Putin en entrevista.


  En el caso de Andrés Manuel López Obrador, para nadie es un secreto su sumisión a Donald Trump, tanto si lo ha hecho por temor ante sus constantes amenazas, como por alguna especie de síndrome de Estocolmo, la realidad es que su fidelidad al polémico magnate neoyorquino le ha impedido expresar palabras de felicitación a Joe Biden, dado que nadie cree su excusa en cuanto a que su postura está basada en los principios de política exterior, particularmente en el principio de no intervención, lo cual resulta evidentemente contradictorio cuando antes, subió al canciller Marcelo Ebrard en un avión de la Fuerza Aérea Mexicana para rescatar de Bolivia al entonces prófugo ex presidente Evo Morales.


  El caso es que la situación de AMLO es completamente diferente a la de Putin que si quiere se puede dar el lujo de no felicitar nunca al nuevo mandatario estadounidense, pero no siendo el presidente de México.


  La cercanía entre los dos países, sus relaciones, sus tratados comerciales, su necesidad de convivir en paz y en un marco de buena vecindad, nos hace cumplir estrictamente reglas establecidas y no establecidas para mantener cierto nivel de diálogo, de comunicación y hasta armonía.


  Y en esto, el canciller Marcelo Ebrard está quedando a deber en el cumplimiento de su tarea como interlocutor entre los dos países, sin menoscabo de que es el principal encargado de conducir la política exterior de nuestro país mediante el diálogo y la cooperación, así como de coordinar la actuación internacional de Gobierno de la República.


  Ebrard es el enlace que puede y debe propiciar esa comunicación entre López Obrador y Joe Biden, más allá de la embajadora Martha Bárcena, quien pareciere no tiene mucha influencia sobre el presidente mexicano.


  Las incongruencias y errores diplomáticos en que ha incurrido el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador no son menores, y si bien quizá no lleguen a escalar y convertirse en un conflicto de mayores dimensiones, sí podría resultar muy caro a los mexicanos; tanto para los que viven en territorio nacional como los que tienen su residencia del otro lado de la frontera norte, lo mismo que empresarios y agricultores por razones lógicas.


  Se ha dicho que “es poco probable que los demócratas sean tan vengativos hacia México como parecía ser el gobierno de Trump, con su enfoque en la construcción de un muro fronterizo y las amenazas de imponer aranceles. Pero una administración Biden que sólo presiona silenciosamente a México para limitar los cruces de migrantes podría dejar a López Obrador en una posición más incómoda.


  México pudo reprimir fácilmente las caravanas de migrantes en 2019 y 2020 porque apaciguar la presión abierta de los Estados Unidos es bastante comprensible si es desagradable en el país, pero pedir a México que lo haga sin amenazas abiertas sería políticamente más costoso para López Obrador”.(Chicago Tribune09/11/20).


  También es cierto que AMLO podría temer represalias en el poco tiempo que le queda a Trump en el cargo, pero le esperan cuatro años con un Joe Biden que tal vez esté dolido y no sabemos a ciencia cierta cómo va a reaccionar.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C.


  Ian Book kept scrambling to buy time and help No. 2 Notre Dame put together multiple long touchdown drives. The Fighting Irish's defense allowed little room for Sam Howell and No. 25 North Carolina's potent offense to do the same.


  Book threw for a score while the Fighting Irish defense locked down the Tar Heels for the final three quarters in a 31-17 victory on Friday. The win kept Notre Dame on course to earn a spot in the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game.


  Both teams scored two first-quarter touchdowns and went into halftime tied at 17, only to see Notre Dame gradually take over in a performance coach Brian Kelly called "one of those road wins that really shows the mettle of your football team."


  "It felt like it was going to be a shootout in the beginning," said Book, adding: "Our defense did an unbelievable job in the second half and gave us a lot of opportunities, and we were able to capitalize on it."


  Book threw for 279 yards and ran for 48 yards for the Fighting Irish (9-0, 8-0 ACC, No. 2 CFP), using his mobility and elusiveness to keep plays alive on a night when both offenses frequently faced long fields.

After the game, Rodgers talked about the fumble by Valdes-Scantling and how he has his back. "I have a lot of love for Marquez," Rodgers said to reporters. "I see the guy every single day, see how much he cares about it. It happens, unfortunately. A lot of it is fundamentals, carrying the ball, but I've had my fair share of fumbles. It was just bad timing, obviously. ... But that stuff happens. He made a big play at the end of regulation to kind of get us going on third-and-10. Disappointed for him, disappointed for us."


  On Monday, Valdes-Scantling was asked about the incident and said he's not letting it get to him. "Social media gives cowards the right to say whatever they want with no consequences, so I guess that's one of those things with the profession that we're in, you've got to take it for what it is, don't let it affect you," the third-year receiver said as reported by ESPN. "It doesn't affect me."


  Before the game went to overtime, the Packers had a 28-14 lead in the half. But the Colts were able to go on a run in the second half, and the Packers needed a late-drive to put the game in overtime. The loss drops the Packers to 7-3 on the year but still has a commanding lead in the NFC North standings. They are also only one game behind the New Orleans Saints for the No. 1 spot in the NFC, so everything is still in front of the Packers in terms of their goals for 2020.

It’s a very delicate balance that can be deep sometimes. This also tasks my job description here as the intellectual think tank and situation room of the party. Most times it comes with its inherent risks so you have to do your diligent risk assessment. To that extent therefore, the call I have to make is whether the position I’m canvassing is self-serving to me or it is, in the long run, beneficial to the party I’m serving as an institution. Once I make the call that in the long run it is beneficial to the party which means every party member including the governors would benefit from that position, I can then go ahead and take the risk. It’s up to me to prove that it’s not going to be beneficial to me but I think on the whole you can easily see from the argument whether one is making a self-serving or altruistic argument.

Patrick Mahomes is looking to be playing in the NFL for a very long time. Earlier this week, the Super Bowl champion talked about facing Tom Brady as the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday. He said he wants to be like Brady when it comes to playing when he's 43 years old.


  "The plan is to still be playing football," Mahomes said to 610 Sports Radio's _The Drive_ when asked when he was going to be doing at 43, which is Brady's age. "So hopefully, I'll be able to be doing that." Mahomes has already won a Super Bowl and an MVP award and hasn't been in the league for five years. He's being looked at as the new face of the NFL, something that Brady has been for the last 20 seasons.


  "You want to win as many championships as possible," Mahomes said when asked if being like Brady in terms of his success is his goal. "He's done that for his entire career and he's still playing great football. For me, it's about coming in day in and day out and trying to better myself and find a way to win championships in Kansas City and hopefully, I can win a lot of them. I'll try to catch the amount of titles and championship games he's been in."


  The Chiefs believe in Mahomes as they signed him to a 10-year, $503 million contracts in July, the biggest contract in NFL history. Despite only playing in his fourth NFL season, Mahomes has accomplished a lot, winning the Super Bowl last season and winning the MVP award in 2018. Right now, the Chiefs to a 9-1 record and have a three-game lead in the AFC West with six games left in the regular season. Mahomes has thrown for 3,035 yards, 27 touchdowns and two interceptions so far this year.


  Mahomes has a long way to go to catch Brady. In his 20-year career, Brady led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances and six Super Bowl wins. He has won the Super Bowl MVP award four times and the NFL MVP award three times. He signed with the Bucs in March, and the team currently has a 7-4 record. In 11 games this year, Brady has thrown for 2,955 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine picks.

President Donald Trump's legal team suffered yet another defeat in court Friday as a federal appeals court in Philadelphia roundly rejected the campaign's latest effort to challenge the state's election results.


  Trump's lawyers vowed to appeal to the Supreme Court despite the judges' assessment that the "campaign's claims have no merit."


  "Free, fair elections are the lifeblood of our democracy. Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here," 3rd Circuit Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, wrote for the three- judge panel, all appointed by Republican presidents.


  The case had been argued last week in a lower court by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who insisted during five hours of oral arguments that the 2020 presidential election had been marred by widespread fraud in Pennsylvania. However, Giuliani failed to offer any tangible proof of that in court.


  U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, another Republican, had said the campaign's error-filled complaint, "like Frankenstein's Monster, has been haphazardly stitched together" and denied Giuliani the right to amend it for a second time.


  The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals called any revisions "futile." Chief Judge D. Brooks Smith and Judge Michael Chagares were on the panel with Bibas, a former University of Pennsylvania law professor. Trump's sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, sat on the court for 20 years, retiring in 2019.


  "Voters, not lawyers, choose the president. Ballots, not briefs, decide elections," Bibas said in the opinion, which also denied the campaign's request to stop the state from certifying its results, a demand he called "breathtaking."


  In fact, Pennsylvania officials had announced Tuesday that they had certified their vote count for President-elect Joe Biden, who defeated Trump by more than 80,000 votes in the state. Nationally, Biden and running mate Kamala Harris garnered nearly 80 million votes, a record in U.S. presidential elections.


  Trump has said he hopes the Supreme Court will intervene in the race as it did in 2000, when its decision to stop the recount in Florida gave the election to Republican George W. Bush. On Nov. 5, as the vote count continued, Trump posted a tweet saying the "U.S. Supreme Court should decide!"


  Ever since, Trump and his surrogates have attacked the election as flawed and filed a flurry of lawsuits to try to block the results in six battleground states. But they've found little sympathy from judges, nearly all of whom dismissed their complaints about the security of mail-in ballots, which millions of people used to vote from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Trump perhaps hopes a Supreme Court he helped steer toward a conservative 6-3 majority would be more open to his pleas, especially since the high court upheld Pennsylvania's decision to accept mail-in ballots through Nov. 6 by only a 4-4 vote last month. Since then, Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett has joined the court.


  "The activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania continues to cover up the allegations of massive fraud," Trump lawyer Jenna Ellis tweeted after Friday's ruling. "On to SCOTUS!"


  In the case at hand, the Trump campaign asked to disenfranchise the state's 6.8 million voters or at least "cherry-pick" the 1.5 million who voted by mail in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and other Democratic-leaning areas, the appeals court said.


  "One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption," Brann, a member of the conservative Federalist Society, wrote in his scathing ruling on Nov. 21. "That has not happened."


  A separate Republican challenge that reached the Pennsylvania Supreme Court this week seeks to stop the state from further certifying any races on the ballot. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf's administration is fighting that effort, saying it would prevent the state's legislature and congressional delegation from being seated in the coming weeks.


  On Thursday, Trump said the Nov. 3 election was still far from over. Yet he said for the first time he would leave the White House on Jan. 20 if the Electoral College formalizes Biden's win.


  "Certainly I will. But you know that," Trump said at the White House, taking questions from reporters for the first time since Election Day.


  On Twitter Friday, however, he continued to baselessly attack Detroit, Atlanta and other Democratic cities with large Black populations as the source of "massive voter fraud." And he claimed, without evidence, that a Pennsylvania poll watcher had uncovered computer memory drives that "gave Biden 50,000 votes" apiece.


  All 50 states must certify their results before the Electoral College meets on Dec. 14, and any challenge to the results must be resolved by Dec. 8. Biden won both the Electoral College and popular vote by wide margins.

Like Mussolini, Hitler initially evinced a similar lack of enthusiasm for atomic weaponry. As far back as 1941, when Carl von Weizsäcker, one of the leaders of Germany’s nuclear research team, filed a draft patent application for a plutonium bomb, the Führer expressed his skepticism in a private conversation with Otto Skorzeny. He was the same SS commando-leader who, two years later, would rescue the Duce from Gran Sasso. “This device, if their description of it proves to be correct,” Hitler concluded, “will have very little tactical value, because rarely are enemy concentrations large and dense enough, either on land or at sea, to be effectively targeted in a 1.5 kilometer blast-radius, except for industrial cities, which conventional air- strikes are presently quite capable of destroying, as this war has already shown.
