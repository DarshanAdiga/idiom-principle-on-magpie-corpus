Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser says that the company is aiming to "make improvements" to the Switch's controversial 'Joy-Con drift'.
 In an interview with Polygon, Bowser discussed the fault, as well as why certain games will be disappearing from Nintendo's storefront in the spring.
 When asked about Joy-Con drift, Bowser said that "first and foremost, we want every consumer to have a great experience with their Nintendo Switch," and that "if consumers have any issue with our hardware and/or software, we want them to contact us, when we will work through the proper solution to get them up and running as fast as possible." As for solving the problem, however, it would seem that Nintendo is still working on it.
 "We've been working very closely with consumers if and when they might have issues, whether it's a replacement or repair. And then, what I will say, as we look at our repair cycles, we're always looking at what is being sent in and for what reasons, and understanding that better. And without going into any details, it always gives us an opportunity to make improvements as we go forward." That's not a definitive solution, but it does sound as though Nintendo is looking into the issue, which is one of the Switch's most public faults, and has been the subject of several lawsuits filed against the company.
 Elsewhere, Bowser discusses Nintendo's decision to pull several games from its platform after a limited time. Super Mario 3D All-Stars, Super Mario Bros 35, and the Super Mario Game & Watch are all being removed from stores on March 31, 2021.
 He says that despite the popularity of some of those titles - Super Mario 3D All-Stars has sold more than 2.6 million units - the aim was to specifically celebrate Mario's 35th anniversary. With that in mind, Nintendo "felt it was an opportunity to release [the games] for a limited period of time." If you're worried you might miss out, you still have a few months to pick the titles up, but thankfully it sounds as though this won't be an ongoing concern - Bowser says that this is "not a strategy that we're going to be using widely, but it's one we thought was very unique for the actual anniversary," although he "can't speak to plans beyond the end of March."

New Delhi [India], December 17 (ANI): Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday tore the copies of the three recently enacted farm laws in the special assembly session and accused the BJP of bringing these laws to get funds for elections.   "BJP has made the elections very costly in the last few years. The farm laws have been made by the BJP for getting funds for elections," Kejriwal said.   "BJP leaders say that the farmers could sell their produce at any place in the country. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) of paddy in the country is Rs 1,868. In Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, paddy is being sold at Rs 900-1,000. Where will these farmers sell their produce to earn a good price?" he asked.   "The country's farmers will actually not sell their produce. The industrialists will buy the farm produce in Uttar Pradesh and then sell it at exorbitant prices across the country," he added.   The Delhi Chief Minister said over 20 farmers have died during the ongoing farmers' agitation. "I want to ask the central government, how many deaths will take place after which their ears will open," he asked.   Kejriwal said that in 1907 the farmers of Punjab had agitated against the British government when they had also passed laws which affected them. He said the British had to repeal these laws.   "During the British rule, there was an agitation conducted by farmers in Punjab. They were agitating against three laws made by the Britishers - Bari Doab Act, Punjab Land Colonisation Act and Punjab Land Alleviation Act. Farmers had agitated for nine months against the British," he said.   "The agitation was led by Bhagat Singh's father Kishori Singh and his uncle Ajit Singh. They had formed Bharatmata Nirman Society under whose aegis the agitation was conducted. The British government had said that they will do amendments but the farmers were resolute on their demand of repealing of the laws. The Britishers had to concede in the end," he added.   Kejriwal said it is not only the farmers who are being misled but the BJP workers are also being misled.   "The central government is saying that the farmers are not understanding the benefits of the law. The leaders of BJP are trying to convince the farmers. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was assuring the farmers in Bareilly that the farmers' land will not be forfeited. Is this a benefit, I ask. The land belongs to the owners of the farmlands," he said.   "The farmers are not only being misled but the BJP workers are also being misled. A case for disrupting traffic due to the farmers' agitation is being heard in the Supreme Court. The advocates for farmers in the court have said that the farmers' demands are valid," he added.   He said farmers are the foundation of the country. "Shouldn't the government advocate the benefits of the farmers or should they be advocating the benefits of the middlemen. The three farm laws were passed by the Rajya Sabha without voting," he said.   AAP MLA Mahendra Goyal also tore the copy of the farm laws during the special session of Delhi assembly.   Farmers are protesting since November 26 at the borders of Delhi against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

Let’s be frank about it, this defeat may have been the first in 27 games and come alongside some great league form and winning Europa League Group D, but the doubt will creep in and questions will be raised over Steven Gerrard and his players’ mentality.
 In this instance, it’s perfectly valid to raise it.
 Perhaps it could be too simplistic for some to hold that view, but it will continue to hang over Gerrard and his players like a black cloud, even more so in the aftermath of this cup exit and that 90-minute performance.
 And the doubts will remain until this group of players and manager get over the line and secure a trophy. It’s only human nature.

 He said the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) was not production of Gate No-4, but believed in democratic course of action. He said, “I believe that Bilawal Bhutto is in better political position during the current campaign.” He said the government wanted to initiate positive negotiations to strengthen democracy in the country.
 He reiterated that the government was ready to negotiate with the opposition on all national issues except corruption cases. He said Prime Minister Imran Khan was also ready to hold positive talks with the opposition on all national issues except corruption cases. Sheikh Rashid said the government, under the leadership of Imran Khan, would complete its five-year constitutional tenure. Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) always supported the democratic process. PML-N President Shahbaz was also in favour of reconciliation.
 He said names of around 400 people were on the Exit Control List (ECL) and directives have been issued to FIA to remove all unnecessary names from it.

 The minister said that he would closely monitor problems being faced by the general public in Nadra and steps would be taken in collaboration with all stakeholders. He said action would also be taken against fake prize schemes. Earlier, upon his arrival at FIA headquarters, the interior minister laid a wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and offered Fateha.

 At 2 p.m., the first doses were brought to the clinic, accompanied by hospital security. A crowd of hospital officials, employees and news media were gathered to watch.

 And that can’t happen quickly enough. He said he hopes by spring that life can start to return to normal.
 “Just having that out in front of our employees is a huge morale booster,” Roberts said. “So this is a big day for us.”

In a counteroffensive, the government has decided to hold Senate elections a month earlier in February in what seems to be a smart move to already divided opposition on the question of en bloc resignations before the polls. A more serious move in regard is a possible review of the 18th Amendment once the PTI gets majority in the Senate. Thus, in all probability Prime Minister Imran Khan will get further strength in case the PPP quits the Sindh government and dissolves the Sindh Assembly.
 In the emerging political scenario, things are gradually heading toward a confrontation before the Senate polls, as there is no yet any sign of a breakthrough between the two sides. If the government handles the situation politically well and survives without giving much to the opposition, cracks would likely widen in PDM ranks, particularly the PML-N.
 The PDM has given almost six weeks to the government in a bid to resolve some of internal problems with regard to resignations and post-long march scenario.
 Sources say Prime Minister Imran Khan and some of Punjab PTI leaders believe after the PDM’s Lahore show the PML-N would not be able to muster much support and consider it the right time for a counteroffensive. They also intend to go for local polls in April or May which, they believe, would be the last nail in the coffin of the PML-N.
 But some party circles are of the view that it would be too early to conclude the PML-N has lost its vote-bank or the party is in disarray.
 Though the PDM, particularly the PML-N, has failed to draw a mammoth crowd in the last three public meetings held in Punjab cities of Gujranwala, Multan and Lahore, it still managed to mobilise a sizeable crowd and vote-banks. More significant part is the narrative it has given in Punjab.
 Now the opposition needs to bury the past if it expects hundreds of thousands of people to march on Islamabad to challenge the writ of the state.
 Though it is too early to judge the final outcome of this movement, it has certainly been successful to bring two mainstream parties close to their position in 2006 when their leaders the late Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif had signed a ‘Charter of Democracy.’ Now for the first time Maryam Nawaz will lead a delegation to attend the 13th death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto. Can they start a new journey where Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif had left in 2006?
 Again it is too early for the PTI government to celebrate the PDM’s flop show in the strongest base of the PML-N. On Dec 13 when the PDM was holding its public meeting in Lahore, the PTI shared from its official account PM’s photograph with his ‘pets’ at his Bani Gala residence to show he (the PM) is indifferent and relaxed. But after the gathering he held quite a few meetings of his advisers to discuss the PDM and a counter strategy.
 Fresh elections and resignation by the PM are the main demands of the PDM. This stand itself is a complete deviation from the position the parties in the PDM had in 2014 when through a resolution they had opposed any extra- constitutional move to oust an elected government.
 The Punjab always acts late when it comes to the politics of agitation. Even in the PNA movement days, it responded almost after one month. Similarly, it did not react during the 1983 MRD movement.
 The PML-N is not the party that does politics of agitation or rallies despite having a large vote bank.
 The PML-N and PPP had also missed the first bus when Maulana Fazlur Rehman announced his ‘Azadi march’. These two parties only gave the token support to the Maulana. Even after the 2018 elections, the JUI leader had asked these parties not to take oath and joined him in the protest. While the two parties had taken a mature political decision at that time and supported the process, the question arises why they have launched the movement after two and a half years.
 With a second spike in Corona cases, the PDM has not only put the leadership’s lives at risk but also its supporters and common man.
 Another fault in the PDM strategy is the attack on the government and establishment. A scathing attack by Nawaz Sharif in particular is helping bringing both the government and establishment more close.
 The PML-N and Nawaz Sharif are not realizing that it would be extremely difficult for the people of Punjab to support his narrative.
 This is the third time the PML-N has mobilized its supporters. No matter how much one criticizes Maryam Nawaz after Minar-e-Pakistan jalsa, she has tried to change the party’s DNA from the drawing room politics to street politics.
 The PDM stance on shutting all doors on the government draws a mixed reaction from all and sundry.
 Some parties in the PDM, including the PPP, are in contact with the PML-Q and those who have reacted cautiously to the PDM’s Lahore show were the Chaudhrys of Gujrat. Sources say PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, who is in touch with Nawaz Sharif and the Chaudhrys, is trying to make Ch Pervaiz Elahi a consensus candidate for the Punjab CM’s slot once they (the Chaudhrys) withdraw from the PTI. The Zardari doctrine can also pave way for a change in Islamabad. The hurdle, however, seems to be the powerful quarters as in the case of the MQM (Pakistan) and Balochistan government,
 The PDM and PML-N in Punjab have certainly mobilized thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, to join the proposed long march. Neither the PML-N has a track record of doing the politics of agitation nor had Punjab played a leading role in the past movements.
 The PDM hardly has a post-march strategy in case if fails to break the government-establishment ties. Many believe that Nawaz Sharif has gone too far too early like what he did during his GT Road march. There is a lot for the alliance to review before launching its decisive ‘march’ on Islamabad.

But whatever Auriemma said in the locker room at halftime must have hit home for UConn, because once the second half hit it was all Huskies all the time led by the Big 3 of Paige Bueckers, Williams and Olivia Nelson-Ododa.

County board members, who approved all the increases at their regular meeting Wednesday, will also see an annual raise of $5,000, bringing them to $12,000 per year, with $12,500 for the commission vice chair and $13,000 for the chair.
 Alger is paid an annual salary of $136,282. He was hired in mid-2018, becoming the fourth person in the county’s top post in six years. His raises were approved on a vote of 5-2, with commissioners Betsy Coffia and Bryce Hundley voting “no.”
 Coffia said giving the raises are substantial and she is worried about the budget, which could be affected over the next year or more by the pandemic. She is also concerned with how the raises will be perceived by the community.
 “I’m thinking about the economy,” Coffia said. “I’m thinking about the optics. A lot of people are out of work.”
 Coffia questioned why the pay scales were adjusted for these administrators and not others, which sends the message that some are doing a great job while others are not.
 An ad hoc committee met Friday for two hours. Coffia said county Register of Deeds Peggy Haines tried to speak at the end of the ad hoc committee meeting, but was cut off. Commission Chairman Rob Hentschel, who heads the committee, said Haines was cut off because she spoke over a commissioner and was out of order.
 Commissioner Gordie LaPointe, who was on the ad hoc committee, said he was not concerned with how other employees would view the raises.
 “I’m not going to go and poll everybody to make sure they’re happy with this,” said LaPointe, who will vacate his seat on the board as he did not run for reelection.
 He said he only considered Alger and the job he’s doing and retaining him is the best thing for the county.
 Commissioner Sonny Wheelock Jr. said he is a big supporter of Alger and thinks he’s doing a great job.
 “But at the end of the day I don’t know how he justifies arbitration with deputies and argues they’ll get 1.5 percent when he’s getting 5 percent plus 1.5 percent cost-of-living,” Wheelock said.
 Wheelock, who voted “yes” for every raise, said the commission also needs to keep in mind that a lot of people in the community are not getting raises and are struggling financially.
 Hentschel said he proposed and headed the committee as most raises are recommended by the HR department and the county administrator.
 “I wanted to look at those high-profile positions who might have trouble recommending their own raises for that perceived conflict of interest,” Hentschel said.

Vasco (Goa) [India], December 17 (ANI): After a terrific start to the season, NorthEast United will be keen to consolidate their place among the top performers in the ongoing Indian Super League (ISL) and extend their unbeaten streak when they lock horns with Jamshedpur FC at the Tilak Maidan Stadium, here on Friday.   The Highlanders will be pleased with the start they've had this campaign after six games. A victory on Friday will put them level on points with table- toppers FC Mumbai City and second-placed ATK Mohun Bagan.   NEUFC found themselves in a similar position the previous season, remaining unbeaten after six games. But two back-to-back defeats saw their momentum slip as they endured a disappointing ninth-place finish.   However, if they manage to avoid a defeat against Jamshedpur, the Guwahati- based side would achieve their best-ever unbeaten run in history.   "We are working hard to be sure we're not going to lose. We try to go for the three points in every single game but I'm not worried (about losing). The most important thing is (that) we keep progressing, improving and we stick to our identity," NorthEast coach Gerard Nus said in an ISL release.  
 "If we get the three points tomorrow, it will be the best (unbeaten) start for us, so looking forward to that," he added.   NorthEast will have to be wary of Jamshedpur striker Nerijus Valskis, who is currently the joint top-scorer alongside FC Goa's Igor Angulo. The Red Miners have been dependent on the Lithuanian upfront, and he has scored six of his team's seven goals so far.   Like NorthEast, Jamshedpur is heading into the game after successive draws. A win for Owen Coyle's men, placed seventh, could enhance their chances of making it into the top four.   Jamshedpur will miss the presence of the suspended midfielder Aitor Monroy, who picked up a red card in the previous game against Mumbai. They will have to ensure they control the midfield and stop NorthEast United's forwards from getting the service they want.   The defence, marshaled by Stephen Eze and Peter Hartley, will also have to play a big role to keep NorthEast's attacking force quiet. So far, only Mumbai have scored more goals than the Highlanders this season.   Coyle expects a tough challenge from his counterpart but also believes in his team's abilities.   "They (NorthEast) are a good team, they have shown they are hard-working and it's going to be a tough game," he said. "We have enormous respect for them but it's also a game we're looking forward to. We know that if we're at our very best, it's a game we can win." (ANI)

It implies that the forthcoming election can be held in February as per the government wish with its aim of hurrying up the process to upset the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) plan to abort the Senate poll through resignations from assemblies. The leaving senators’ tenure expires on March 11, 2021 and their replacements can be elected any time after February 11, former Upper House Chairman Barrister Wasim Sajjad explained to The News, when contacted.
 He referred to Article 224(3) of the Constitution, which says an election to fill the seats in the Senate, which are to become vacant on the expiration of the term of the members of the Senate shall be held not earlier than thirty days immediately preceding the day on which the vacancies are due to occur.
 Thus, the election can’t be held more than a month before the end of the term of the outgoing senators. It can also not be delayed beyond the expiry of such tenure. In 2018, the oath was administered to the newly-elected senators on March 11, 2018, starting their term.
 However, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issues the schedule for such polls after every three years even before this one month time begins.
 Under the polls law, the ECP is the sole authority to organise elections to the Senate. The process is spread over different phases that will take about a month to conclude if the 2018 election schedule is any guide and is repeated this time as well.
 The ECP had issued the schedule on Feb 2, 2018 under the Elections Act, 2017, and supervised the polling on March 3 in the four provincial assemblies, consuming almost a month in these proceedings. It had released a separate schedule for election of two senators by the National Assembly, which spanned 28 days.
 If the ECP fully goes along the government’s decision, it may make public the election schedule in the second week of January and organise the polling after Feb 11. It may also shorten the schedule as allowed by the Elections Act.
 The exercise involved issuance of a notification by the ECP to fill the impending vacant seats and fixed the last dates for filing nomination papers, publication of the names of nominated candidates, scrutiny of candidacy papers, filing of appeals against acceptance/rejection of nominations, disposal of appeals by the election tribunal, publication of revised list of candidates and withdrawal of candidature.
 The Elections Act says the Returning Officer (RO) may, for the purpose of scrutiny, require any agency, authority or organisation, including a financial institution, to produce any document or record or to furnish any such information as may be necessary to determine facts relating to an objection to the candidature of a contestant. However, he will not ask any question which has no nexus with the information supplied in the paper; or has not arisen from the objections raised by any person or from information received during the scrutiny.
 The RO will question a candidate’s declaration that he is qualified to contest and has met the requirements of the poll law only if tangible material to the contrary is available on record. He may, either on his own motion or upon any objection, conduct such summary inquiry as he may think fit and reject a nomination paper if he is satisfied that the candidate is not qualified, the proposer or the seconder is not eligible to subscribe to the nomination paper; the law has not been complied with or the declaration is false or incorrect in any material particular and the signature of the proposer or seconder is not genuine.
 The RO will not reject a nomination paper on the ground of any defect which is not of a substantial nature and may allow any such defect to be remedied forthwith and will not inquire into the correctness or validity of any entry in the electoral roll.
 Where a candidate deposits any amount of loan, tax or government dues and utility expenses payable by him of which he is unaware at the time of filing of his nomination paper, his candidature will not be rejected on the ground of such default. However, if the RO is satisfied that the aspirant has willfully concealed such dues, he will reject his nomination paper.
 An appeal against scrutiny will be summarily decided within the time fixed by the ECP and any order so passed will be final. If, on the basis of information or material coming to its knowledge by any source, a tribunal is of the opinion that a candidate whose nomination has been accepted is a defaulter of loans, taxes, government dues and utility expenses or has had any loan written off or has willfully concealed such fact or suffers from any other disqualification from being elected as a member of the Senate, it may, on its own motion, call upon him to show cause why his papers may not be rejected. If the tribunal is satisfied that he is actually a defaulter or has had a loan written off or suffers from any disqualification, it may reject the nomination paper.

Of course, the hysteria following such a result will mean the game on Saturday afternoon will be scrutinised to the nth degree and it’s the type of fixture Rangers should be looking at and be itching to put things right in terms of bouncing back.
 When they drew 3-3 at Benfica, they were ruthless and destroyed Hamilton 8-0.
 Obviously the three points are of paramount importance but a strong performance is key to get eradicate any lingering feeling of disappointment.
 Gerrard was quick to defend the players in his post-match media obligations, and perhaps he will be doubting his team selection with the way the match unfolded.
 Given the importance he’s put upon winning his first trophy as a manager, would it not have been better to field the strongest available side?
 I was slightly surprised to see so many regular starters left out, especially when it was a game that meant so much and was away also from home against a team who are in good form.
 However, I will balance that by saying there weren’t many who would have had much to grumble with when the line-up dropped an hour prior to kick-off.

But it was once again Bueckers who. coming off of her first of likely many Big East Freshman of the Week honors, played the biggest part in the Huskies earning the win. She finished the game with a team-high 25 points, four rebounds and five assists, leading the charge in the third quarter and once again proving she deserves the hype surrounding her.

They stressed that it was the responsibility of the Mashaikh in countering sectarianism and extremism and building a society, which promotes tolerance, peace and living in harmony.

 Noor-ul-Haq Qadri said the credit of frustrating the attempts of creating chaos and hatching conspiracies against the country goes to the armed forces of Pakistan, he said. “Pakistan was created after a long struggle, rendering unprecedented sacrifices -and December 16 (when Pakistan dismembered) is the day of reiteration of rendering sacrifices for the country,” he said.
 He said his forefathers had supported the creation of Pakistan in 1947, which proved excellent decision as minorities were being treated brutally in India. Today, the dire need is to strengthen Pakistan, as it was created in the name of Islam.
 Minorities were enjoying unprecedented freedom in the country, which is uncommon in any other country of the world. He said seminaries and shrines were enjoying unprecedented liberty in the country, as such freedom was not being enjoyed in any other country.

Gerrard and his players cannot let this result derail the rest of the season and prove those who will describe them as bottlers are wrong.
 That is where his management skills will become so vital.
 He’s got to pick them up and keep them in good spirits ahead of the upcoming matches.
 As always, though, the proof will come in the form of results.
 They have to put this one behind them and use it as the fuel to refocus their efforts.
