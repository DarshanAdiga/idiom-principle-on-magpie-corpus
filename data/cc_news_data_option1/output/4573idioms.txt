Retail sales of passenger vehicles (PVs) fell nearly 9% in October from a year earlier as factors such as lower discounts and supply chain-related issues dragged down demand, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) said on Monday.
 The numbers are in stark contrast to the strong growth posted by OEMs in dispatches to the dealers anticipating strong demand during Diwali. While market leader Maruti Suzuki had posted an 18% growth in wholesale sales, players such as Hyundai and Hero MotoCorp had witnessed record sales.
 FADA said even though the nine-day Navratri period witnessed robust vehicle registrations, October retail sales were in the red compared to October 2019 when both Navratri and Diwali were in the same month.

  Theatre owners have positively indicated that more movie-goers will come in before the show commences. To lure customers in, many theatres have also slashed prices of food and beverages.


  “We will be opening our theatre on Wednesday as Tuesday is not an auspicious day. But we have opened bookings and the response has not been good. We have received only 3% bookings, but we will run the show,” said a city-based theatre owner, who has been in the business for over two decades.


  Udeep B., managing director of Mayajaal, said, “We are opening theatres with films that were running in March — _Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal_ , starring Dulquer Salmaan; _Dharala Prabhu_ and _Oh My Kadavule_. We will get clarity on Deepavali releases in another day or two and based on that, we will chalk out our Deepavali plans.”


  Sathyam Cinemas will open its doors for patrons on Tuesday. All screens under PVR Cinemas will go live and bookings have already begun. According to a note issued by PVR Cinemas, the brand has reopened with a strategic focus on building customer confidence as its primary objective. For this, innovative schemes and promotions have been introduced on pricing as well as content.


  ## Popular releases


  Currently, PVR Cinemas is releasing _Break the Silence_ , in addition to some popular releases from the past, like _Dharala Prabhu_ , _Oh My Kadavule_ , _Hit_ and _Bheeshma,_ along with award-winning Hollywood blockbusters like _My Spy_ , _1917_ and _Joker_ , among others.


  Archana Kalpathi, CEO, AGS Cinemas, said, “We are finally opening with actor Vijay’s _Bigil_. We have introduced a lot of technology to monitor patrons and ensure that they adhere to physical distancing norms.” She added that parking charges would be waived off.


  GK Cinema’s Ruban Mathivanan said they would be commencing operations by Wednesday with Dhanush’s _Pudhupettai_.


  Meanwhile, Qube Cinema has condemned the Tamil Film Active Producers’ Association’s (TFAPA) boycott of new releases as theatres are struggling to regain a foothold after the lockdown.


  The State government’s decision to allow theatres to reopen has been met with a challenge from TFAPA, which has refused to offer new releases unless the virtual print fees (VPF), paid to the theatres, is abolished altogether.


  The issue came up earlier, in 2018, and the entire film industry went on a strike that ended after digital cinema providers reduced VPF rates by over 20%. Till date, digital service providers have offered a drastic reduction of VPF rates, but no compromise has been achieved.


  In a statement, Qube Cinema said, “Our industry has faced immense losses over the last seven months due to the lockdown, and we will continue to take time to recoup, as we are being allowed to operate only at 50% capacity for the time being. Qube Cinema had initially, and proactively, announced a 50% reduction in VPF during the period, which was later amended to 60% after pressure from TFAPA, who now insist on a complete elimination of the fees.” Qube Cinema said both the Central and State governments had supported the view that the tradition of new releases for Deepavali should continue this year, which is why the boycott by TFAPA was not just unethical towards theatres and digital cinema providers, but also unfair to the audiences.


  Qube Cinema added, “It is our understanding that producers who have been eager to release new films have been pressured to conform to the boycott. The TFAPA is leveraging this unprecedented period of struggle to gain as many concessions as possible from theatres and digital service providers, for itself, without regard for how it affects the industry at large or the cinema audience.” Qube Cinema said this was a time when the industry should come together to ensure that cinema survives.

As expected from a soundbar without a separate subwoofer, however, the 300's bass performance won't rumble tables or shake your body. But, the low-end should generally be sufficient. The same can be said for the Sonos Beam. As a standalone soundbar, the Beam's bass gets the job done. In fact, the Beam offers a little more depth, as is apparent when listening to Kylo Ren's first scene in "The Force Awakens" on both soundbars.
 Like the Bose, the Sonos Beam also features four full-range drivers and a tweeter specifically aimed at clear dialogue. When switching back and forth between the two soundbars, I slightly prefer the sound of the Beam. It's a little more neutral and the deeper midrange frequencies add a fuller quality to the sound.
 The slight performance differences between both models are noticeable but not definitive. By that, I mean each has a personality and its own take on audio. During extended testing time with each soundbar separately, I enjoy whichever model I'm listening to. They're both unique, but neither is better simply because the other is worse.
 Through all TV and music listening, I purposefully keep each soundbar at their default settings. This helps give a sense of what most people might experience out of the box without further tweaking. Of course, each soundbar does have basic bass and treble settings in their apps so you can shape the sound even further to your preference.

House Democrats are showing no sign they intend to just let President Donald Trump off the hook once he's out of office.
 In fact, Trump's re-election loss gives them even more opportunity to get to the bottom of questions they've been pursuing for years around the New York businessman-turned-politician's finances and taxes.
 Lawmakers armed with subpoena power could also turn up information that federal prosecutors might not know about as the Justice Department under Joe Biden weighs whether to pursue a criminal case against Trump, who as a former president will no longer have immunity from such matters.
 But there will be caution flags, too. Democrats both in Congress and the new Biden administration will need to decide how to satisfy calls from progressives to aggressively investigate the Trump presidency as it fades in the rearview mirror and pleas from the incoming commander-in-chief for the country to unite after a bitter election marked by a deadly pandemic and economic turmoil.
 House Democrats don't want to just simply close the door on the lame-duck Trump without finishing at least some of their years-long inquiries and court battles, though.
 Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a progressive member of the party who serves on two of the top committees investigating the president, said there "must be accountability" for Trump and his administration after they stonewalled congressional oversight for years.
 "I fully expect the House's various investigations into the current Occupant of the White House and the actions of his Administration--including the investigations into his tax returns, campaign finance and ethics violations, obstruction of justice and election interference, and more--to proceed once Donald Trump is evicted from the White House," Pressley said Monday in a statement to Insider.
 Democrats may also get a helping hand in their efforts once Biden gets sworn in and installs new leadership atop the federal government. At that point, agencies like the IRS and Treasury that have often ignored record requests from House lawmakers over the past four years could start sending them reams of long sought-after documents.

Down 21-3 in the second quarter, things were looking grim for the Bethel College football team.


   


  From there, the Thresher offense finally started coming alive and the defense started making stops. With two seconds remaining and the ball on the one-yard line, Zach Esau powered into the endzone to hand the Threshers a 39-35 win over Southwestern College Saturday in a clash of KCAC unbeatens at Thresher Stadium.


   


  Chantz Scurry followed with a two-point conversion run to prevent a field goal from tying or beating Bethel.


   


  "That's what we've been running all year," Esau said. "That's our go-to play. It's a quarterback power off the edge. I have to stay on my feet. I got some good blocks. They were solid up there. That credit goes to the whole team. We start with a touchback. It's that flexbone team in a two-minute offense."


   


  "Sometimes when you have the career touchdown leader on the team, you just have to give him the ball," Bethel coach Terry Harrison said. "It was between him and Scurry."


   


  Esau finished the day eight of 10 passing for 197 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. He extends to 35 his career rushing touchdown record.


   


  It's the biggest comeback for the Threshers in recent years, possibly among the biggest in school history.


   


  "We just weren't playing our game in the first half," Esau said. "We weren't in it mentally. We were a little nervous. We came out and realized that it's nothing special. We're in a game, just another game. That's all it really came down to."


   


  Last year, Bethel led 24-7 going into the fourth quarter, but Southwestern outscored the Threshers 21-0.


   


  "This was a big game coming into it," Esau said. "Two undefeated teams in conference. We had yet to beat them. It was just good to get a win, a really good team win."


   


  "We didn't do much different," Terry Harrison said. "They are a very good team on defense. When you play us over the course of a game, it's hard. It's easy for a defense to play us early, but over the course of a game, we wear people down a little bit. It's a very physical style of play. It overtook them."


   


  Mason Murray rushed for 77 yards on 11 carries with a touchdown for Bethel. Murray also caught three passes for 32 yards. Scurry finished with 60 yards on 12 carries.


   


  Josh Seabolt finished with 16 total tackles. Dominic Brown had 10 tackles.


   


  Southwestern, 4-1 overall and in the KCAC, was led by Brag Cagle, who hit 13 of 22 passes for 241 yards and two touchdowns. Cagle also rushed for a touchdown. Keyshawn Jones had five catches for 144 yards and two touchdown. Keyshawn Wyatt rushed for 85 yards on 25 carries with two touchdowns.


   


  Bethel stopped Southwestern on the Moundbuilders' first two possessions, but the Moundbuilders scored on the third -- a three-yard Cagle run. A short punt allowed Southwestern to go 34 yards in three plays, scoring on a 20-yard Wyatt run.


   


  Bethel finally got a drive that got into Southwestern territory, stalling out at the 14 due to a Thresher penalty. Logan DeMond nailed a 31-yard field goal.


   


  A Southwestern drive was aided by a pass interference call and a roughing the passer call. The second penalty wiped out an interception. Cagle hit Jones for a 32-yard pass.


   


  Bethel finally finished a drive with eight seconds left in the half when Esau hit Camryn Harrison for a 10-yard touchdown pass. A late hit call against Southwestern allowed Bethel to score the two-point conversion on a pass from Esau to Brayden Francis.


   


  Bethel fumbled on the first play of the second half at the Thresher 48. A Southwestern fumble in the red zone set up a 14-yard run for Murray.


   


  Bethel got the ball back on a Trey Palmer interception, but the Threshers failed to capitalize. A 51-yard Jones punt return put the ball at the BC 5. The Moundbuilders were stopped on downs on a Ryan Clark sack. On the following play, Esau hit Francis for a 91-yard touchdown. The play was four yards off the record for the longest Bethel scoring pass play. Bethel missed the PAT kick, but an offside penalty gave Bethel an extra chance.


   


  Cagle put Southwestern back in the lead on a 70-yard pass to Jones. Bethel replied with a drive that ended on a 15-yard Amondr'e Schumpert-Street run. The PAT kick was missed.


   


  On fourth and 9 near midfield, Cagle hit a 36-yard pass to Jones to give the Moundbuilders the ball at the eight. Wyatt scored on a one-yard run.


   


  Bethel's final drive covered 75 yards in 15 plays, taking 4:21.


   


  Southwestern couldn't field the kickoff cleanly, killing the clock.


   


  Bethel is 7-0, 6-0 in KCAC play. Bethel plays at 2-4 Tabor at 2 p.m. Saturday in Hillsboro. Tabor had a bye week, but fell to Avila 59-0 Oct. 31.


   


  "We haven't beaten them since I've been here," Terry Harrison said. "We're taking them very seriously. Our community takes great pride in that match-up with Tabor. They're going to get our best shot."

The office of the Lt. Governor has accorded approval for funds towards payment of salary/pension arrears to aided school teachers and greenlighted the proposal for a waiver of road tax for private passenger and goods carriers.


  The decision comes as relief for aggrieved aided school teachers and private travel operators, who had been agitating pressing for their demands.


  According to a press note from the Raj Nivas, the Education Department was in the process of verifying the accounts of private-run grant-in-aid schools which are collecting fees from students as per the rate fixed by the Statutory Fee Committee. Since verification takes time, as an interim measure, the L-G’s office today approved release of grant-in-aid to a tune of ₹845 lakh to 35 schools as recommended by the Finance Department to pay salary to teachers.


  The Lt. Governor’s office has also ordered the constitution of a committee to relook into the GIA (grant-in-aid) Rules which will be chaired by Development Commissioner/ Secretary (Education) as Chairman and Finance and Law Secretaries as members.


  Approval was also accorded to the request to waive the road tax due for two months for goods carriers and for two quarters or six months for passenger carriers to offset the losses related to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

A spokesperson for Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee declined to answer questions about its plans for the investigation and court case come the new year.
 The Financial Services Committee has targeted Trump's financial activity as well, but is running an even "broader investigation into money laundering and the safety and soundness of lending practices at financial institutions," Committee Chair Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said earlier this year. The committee has subpoenaed a total of nine banks as part of that effort.
 The Financial Services Committee's wider focus perhaps increases its likelihood of moving forward in a post-Trump era -- especially as Deutsche Bank continues to face serious questions about its ability to stop the flow of illicit funds through its accounts. Spokespeople for the committee did not respond to requests for comment.
 The third case included in the Supreme Court ruling involves the Oversight Committee, which requested records from Trump's accounting firm, Mazars USA, as part of a probe into whether the president lied about his wealth on financial disclosure forms, as alleged by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen. The lower court held a hearing on the case in October, but hasn't said when it will make a ruling.
 The court "could issue its decision soon," a Democratic aide to the committee told Insider, adding that the panel won't be abandoning its efforts come the new year.
 "We fully expect and hope the Court will decide in our favor so we can finally obtain the documents we have been seeking for almost two years and tailor our ongoing legislative efforts accordingly through the next Congress," the aide said in a statement.
 The House Judiciary Committee is also involved in a case destined for the Supreme Court. The panel is trying to force the Department of Justice to turn over grand jury materials from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which typically remain secret, as part of an ongoing probe into whether Trump obstructed justice -- something Mueller also examined.
 The special counsel's report laid out 10 instances where Trump may have obstructed justice, but Mueller didn't make a decision as to whether the president should have been charged, citing a longstanding Justice Department legal opinion stating that sitting presidents should not be prosecuted.

"The Committee intends to continue pursuing the case," House Ways and Means Committee spokesperson Erin Hatch said in an email on Friday.
 Separately, the Democratic aide -- who works for a member of the Ways and Means Committee -- said they also expect the investigation into Trump's taxes to move forward, but that it could take a backseat to the "more urgent" matter of examining the United States Postal Service "in light of what is happening."
 The USPS is currently in hot water for failing to comply with a federal court order on election day to check its facilities for undelivered mail-in ballots, and the House Oversight Committee has been investigating Postmaster General Louis DeJoy -- once a major GOP fundraiser -- since September for possibly violating election laws. Before that, DeJoy testified before the committee about growing service delays as the country geared up to vote by mail in unprecedented numbers due to the pandemic.
 But there's a broader issue that a third Democratic lawmaker says ensures that at least some of the court battles continue -- the breadth of Congress' subpoena power, which lies at the heart of the cases.
 "We have to press the cases we have already litigated," said the House member, who also requested anonymity to speak about internal matters and who serves on two committees that have investigated the president. "Otherwise, we would be conceding Congress does not have a subpoena power -- which hangs in question," the lawmaker said.
 Three of those outstanding court cases involve subpoenas for financial records on Trump, his three oldest children, and his businesses that his lawyers have argued have no legitimate legislative purpose. The Supreme Court considered all three cases together in the summer, ruling in July that the president couldn't defy requests from Congress outright, but that a lower court should decide using a new four-part test whether the committees need to narrow their demands.
 Two of those House committees -- Intelligence and Financial Services -- have already voluntarily limited the scope of their subpoenas. The Intelligence Committee, which had demanded records from longtime Trump lender Deutsche Bank, reduced the time frame of their request, among other things, while the Financial Services Committee also narrowed a similar subpoena to Deutsche Bank and dropped a separate one to Capital One.
 The Intelligence Committee requested the financial records as part of an investigation into Russian election interference as well as any foreign financial leverage that exists over the president or those around him. Deutsche Bank, which loaned Trump millions when other banks wouldn't, has come under intense scrutiny in recent years in the fallout of a series of Russian money laundering scandals involving the German lender.

  He reiterated that it is crucial not to overdo things and follow the lockdown rules strictly until December 2, after which England is set to revert to a tiered lockdown system.


  “We cannot let our enthusiasm (about a vaccine) run away with us. It is more vital now than ever that we follow the basics,” Mr. Johnson said.


  England’s deputy chief medical officer Prof. Jonathan Van-Tam, who joined Mr. Johnson at the briefing, said he was “hopeful” that the first vaccine could be seen by Christmas after Pfizer’s announcement earlier on Monday that its vaccine candidate has proven 90% effective in a large trial.


  “This is a very important scientific breakthrough. I am certain of that. I am hopeful because of all that, but not yet certain that we could begin to see some vaccine by Christmas I think we have to be optimistic but we have to wait and see how vaccine manufacture goes,” said Prof Van-Tam.


  Alas, the death figures are tragically rising, running at an average of over 300 a day — sadly double where they were 24 days ago. The number of COVID-19 patients in hospital has risen from just over 10,000 two weeks ago to nearly 13,000 on November 5, and we are heading towards the levels of the previous peak, said Mr. Johnson, as the experts ran through the statistics with him.


  The main focus of Monday’s briefing was on the mass testing rolled out in Liverpool on Friday, which Mr. Johnson said were being widely taken up in the city and urged others to also come forward and get tested for your friends, for your relatives, for your community .


  He confirmed that the government is going beyond the city-wide pilot and sending out hundreds of thousands of rapid lateral flow tests to local authorities right across England and other parts of the United Kingdom.


  “We’re also working with universities to establish, as soon as possible, similar mass testing capacity for students up and down the country,” Mr. Johnson added.

Hopeful marijuana delivery entrepreneurs and supporters, including a couple of state representatives, huddled virtually to get on the same page and encourage advocacy ahead of a public hearing later this week that could determine what kind of delivery industry gets rolled out in Massachusetts.


  Home delivery of marijuana has long been allowed under the state's medical marijuana program, and the Cannabis Control Commission has been thinking about a non-medical delivery framework for about three years. During that time, advocates have argued that delivery-only licenses will help level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses because the barriers to entry for delivery are typically far less burdensome than those for retail licenses.


  Though the CCC has approved a delivery policy, it postponed the late October vote it had planned to take to make official its new regulations -- including the delivery policy -- after vocal opposition from a group of state lawmakers, some municipal officials and representatives of the existing brick-and-mortar retail marijuana industry. The CCC scheduled a hearing specific to delivery for Friday and now plans to vote Nov. 30 to adopt its regulations, which could still change.


  "Delivery has a chance to balance equity, where now people can really have a chance to create generational wealth, to create these businesses and go forward. But that fight is being opposed by larger groups who really want to keep the status quo. You have seen that in the last month or so with various groups coming out to oppose delivery, and really what we're here to do is to fight and defend delivery," Chris Fevry, co-founder of Your Green Package and president of the Massachusetts Cannabis Association for Delivery, said.


  Social equity is a central component of the marijuana law passed by voters in 2016 and the law as rewritten by the Legislature the following year. How Massachusetts' newly legal marijuana industry could be accessible to racially and economically diverse communities and how the industry could benefit groups that were disproportionately affected by the enforcement of marijuana prohibition has been a centerpiece of policy work in Massachusetts and at the CCC.


  Still, people of color and people from communities disproportionately harmed by the War on Drugs are the overwhelming minority in the state's burgeoning legal cannabis world, Shanel Lindsay, who has served on the Cannabis Advisory Board and is the CEO of Ardent Life, said.


  "Despite the fact that we worked tirelessly for over five years, minority ownership is almost non-existent. So yes, we should be angry and offended when, as we're starting to make small steps towards equity in these delivery licenses, that like clockwork the same corporate interests focused only on preserving their unearned monopoly come in to push back on equity and to crush us," she said.


  Kobie Evans, who co-owns the first Massachusetts marijuana company to secure a license through the CCC's economic empowerment process, voiced his support for the delivery framework as approved by the CCC and said moving ahead with delivery licenses is one way Massachusetts can improve its record when it comes to equity in the industry.


  "We need to let the CCC know that they need to do better because so far it's been inadequate," Evans, who co-owns Pure Oasis in Dorchester, said. "So far, the fact that we are one of a handful of [economic empowerment] applicants that have been licensed and so far, one of only a few that's actually been opened when the law was designed to support people like us, that's a travesty. We need to do better as a state. We need to demand more and people need to be held accountable."


  Reps. Chynah Tyler and Lindsay Sabadosa voiced their support for the delivery cause Monday, with Tyler telling the prospective entrepreneurs that she would be willing to step in and try to address delivery issues through the Legislature, though she said that would be less than ideal.


  "I'll be there every step of the way trying to figure out how we can make sure that these regulations work for everyone," Tyler, who represents parts of Roxbury and the Fenway, said. "Because I can tell you right now that if this issue doesn't get addressed by the date that the board is going to vote on it, it can very well go backwards and turn into the hands of the state Legislature and we might have to create a bill around it."


  The CCC's delivery policy would create two delivery license types: a "marijuana delivery operator" that could buy products wholesale from growers and manufacturers and sell them to their own customers, and a "marijuana courier" that would allow an operator to charge a fee to make deliveries from CCC-licensed retailers and dispensaries.


  The CCC also intends to launch delivery with a period of exclusivity for participants in its Social Equity Program and certified economic empowerment applicants.


  "Consumers want delivery, we wanted delivery for a long time, and equity and economic empowerment businesses are ready to be a significant part of this market," Commissioner Shaleen Title said when the commission adopted the delivery framework. She added, "We as a commission have taken it very seriously since day one ... to live up to this mandate to include disproportionately harmed people in the industry and today was another significant step towards that. I'm really looking forward to it becoming reality sometime next year."


  Before it voted to adopt the delivery structure, the CCC released the public feedback it received and summarized comments related to the regulations, and the documents showed a stark divide -- one portion of commenters generally proposed tweaks to what the CCC had adopted while the other portion tended to argue that what the CCC adopted is either in conflict with state law or is the result of a rushed process that left municipalities out.


  The Massachusetts Municipal Association opposed the wholesale delivery license type, local officials told the CCC they were worried about what delivery would mean for marijuana tax revenue, the Commonwealth Dispensary Association said it thought the CCC went too quickly and asked for more time to "develop a compromise," and a group of state lawmakers called on the CCC to delay its vote, which the CCC has done until Nov. 30.


  In a letter last month, a bipartisan group of 19 state lawmakers told the CCC that they "believe that the wholesale delivery license category proposed in the draft regulations was not contemplated, nor supported, by the enabling legislation" and that "the proposed draft regulations have not had the opportunity to be sufficiently reviewed and may result in unintended consequences to our municipalities."


  CCC Chairman Steven Hoffman has said the CCC is convinced that it has the legal authority to introduce the marijuana delivery operator license.

Once again CNN and their ilk prefer fluff over substance… so let me clue you in what the Commie News Network won't tell you- that the substance of the legal challenge in Pennsylvania (with 20 EC votes at stake) is that all ballots received after 8 PM- outside the original State election rules- which cannot be changed on a whim or by some local Judge- will therefore be considered null and void. So lets recall- that President Trump had a 700,000 vote lead before the Dems shut down the counting- only to declare overnight that magically Joe Biden had not only caught up- but had surpassed the President while no-one was watching. Yeh…. Right ! In the end this could go to the supreme court- where Biden will lose the 20 Electoral Votes. And in even more interesting announcements today- it seems the President has hired the Lawyer who successfully defeated CNN and their ilk for their lies-slander- and misrepresentation of the Covington High School kids to the tune of millions of dollars in penalties- this would be a much bigger feather in his cap proving how the Dems and the media colluded to try and steal this election- I told you all- this President is a fighter and a winner- he won't leave office until all the legal votes prove he has lost !

KENDALLVILLE — After 23 years in business, Kendallville’s Family Video is closing.


  While physical video stores have been a challenging business since the advent of streaming video services, Family Video’s district manager said COVID-19 was the final stroke.


  “The local Family Video store is closing in Kendallville after 23 years in the community. While we have faced digital competition from Netflix and others for years, nothing has been as devastating to our business as COVID-19,” District Manager Scott Jaynes said. “We are having a liquidation sale now and plan to completely shutdown by mid-December or sooner if we sell through all the product.”


  The store at 123 N. Main St. will be officially closed before the end of the year. It’s been in business since 1997 and also shares its building with a Little Caesars pizza.


  Family Video had announced earlier this fall that it would be shutting more than 200 locations amid ongoing stress from competition and the pandemic.


  Auburn’s location put on the chopping block in September, but at the time the company said Angola and Kendallville locations would remain open.


  Once a hub for home movie rentals on video cassette and DVDs, video stores began facing immense pressure in the 2000s from new services like the mail- order Netflix service, Redbox DVD kiosks and eventually video streaming from Netflix and numerous others have have emerged since.


  Family Video, the last major video rental store chain in business, still will have more than 250 stores across the Midwest even after its numerous 2020 closings.


  “We are very thankful to have been able to provide entertainment for many family movie nights, and want to thank the people of Kendallville and our incredible staff for the many years of support and service,” said Keith Hoogland, CEO, Highland Ventures, LTD, the parent company of Family Video.


  People can visit familyvideo.com to purchase movies, games, CBD products and other merchandise. Stores will officially close when inventory is sold out.

Being decent, orderly, religious is helpful to others and pleasing to one's God, and to worship with excellence, however, it must be undistracting excellence.

Because of COVID-19, many of the monthly events planned for 2020 had to be canceled, but the county is proceeding with its “Light Up the Sky” tricentennial grand finale.


  Of course, that’s after the original event, planned for the Fourth of July at the Naval Support Facility Dahlgren, was postponed. And the earlier setting for the Nov. 14 outdoor festival and fireworks show—at King George High School—had to be scrapped because health officials at Heritage Hall nursing home, next to the school, feared the loud booms would trigger flashbacks for the older veterans in the facility.

Furthermore, when an epidemic is increasing within a nation, that produces an economic depression in all economic sectors that depend upon people getting physically close to one-another, such as public transit, hotels, performing arts, and restaurants. Moreover, coronavirus-19 is massively destroying “mom- and-pop” retailers, while boosting the mega-corporate ones such as Walmart, and, especially, Amazon, and is therefore restructuring the economy of the affected nations. Bankruptcies are soaring because of small businesses losing money, as customers reduce their frequencies of patronizing brick-and-mortar businesses. As a result of this, wealth-inequalities are soaring, and the previously existing world — in which the vulnerability that a business will have, to being especially negatively impacted by an epidemic, was only a _minor_ factor in determining the insurance-rates and interest-rates that it will be charged — is likely gone forever. Insuring, and investing in, a small business, will become even less attractive to invest in than it has previously been. The insurance-costs will rise for small businesses, but not for large businesses (which will increasingly be serving the customers that small businesses will be losing). Economic concentration will increase. And, so, success at keeping the infection-rate down is also a major component of a government’s success at retaining small businesses and economic diversity, and at keeping the economy’s production-rate up, and at preventing the mega- corporations from replacing even more small businesses and taking over everything. Maintaining full employment in the near term (by ignoring the virus) can then produce massive unemployment in the long term. The pressures that a government faces, to keep small businesses open, will — if the government yields to those current pressures — increase the spread of the virus, and thereby increase not only the death-rate, but the unemployment- rate, and thereby reduce economic output. So: not only is the public’s well- being and safety an _additional_ factor in determining a government’s success, but it is _the more basic factor_ , as compared to the Washington-Consensus- presumed _only_ factor, which is per-capita GDP ( _current_ production). The public’s well-being and safety is actually _the most crucial factor in determining a government’s success at serving its public, and it might even be the biggest factor, of all_.

Rookie tight end Albert Okwuegbunam is out for the year after tearing his right ACL in the Denver Broncos’ loss at Atlanta on Sunday.


  “The fortunate thing of it was it’s just the ACL,” coach Vic Fangio said Monday. “Many times when you get an ACL it involves some other ligaments. So, his rehab and repair should go clean and he should be back as good as new next season.”


  Okwuegbunam (pronounced owe-COO-ay-BOO-num) and quarterback Drew Lock had a built-in chemistry from their time together at the University of Missouri, and it showed during red zone drills at training camp when the two hooked up time after time for touchdowns.


  Okwuegbunam, who caught 17 TD passes from Lock in their two years together in college, cracked the Broncos game day lineup a month ago and had 11 receptions for 121 yards and a touchdown.

ADRIAN -- While there are many programs and organizations designed for the assistance and continued care of veterans from the United States armed forces, Adrian is home to a somewhat unique weekly veterans-based program.


   


  The Woodworking for Warriors Program, as held weekly on Wednesdays at the Sam Beauford Woodworking Institute (SBWI), as helmed and co-founded by Luke Barnett, seeks to be a therapy program for veterans of all ages and military ranks.


   


  The course is free of charge to any veteran. Its hours on Wednesdays are from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.


   


  The SBWI has an open-door policy on these Wednesdays. Whenever it is convenient for a student to stop in, they are free to do so within that 12-hour window.


   


  The Woodworking for Warriors Program is much more than a therapy program, however. The program allows students to find a creative side of themselves. It has spawned into a hobby of woodworking at home for many of its participants, and it also encourages relationship building, teamwork and trust.


   


  "Woodworking has done a lot for me in my life, and that's why I thought it would be great for me to offer this program to those who have done so much for our country," Barnett said.


   


  The SWBI is located on the wooded grounds of the Adrian Center for the Arts and PlaneWave Instruments, 1375 N. Main St., Adrian.


   


  In March 2021, the Woodworking for Warriors Program will celebrate its third year.


   


  State and local funding helps make the program possible as do local donations.


   


  Barnett said about $50,000 is given to the woodshop for its veterans program.


   


  In nearly three years time, close to 140 veterans -- some local and some from around Michigan and even out of state -- have participated in the program.


   


  "Our goal is to share this opportunity with as many people as possible," Barnett said.


   


  Wednesday class sizes range from 15 to 20 students. There have been times when as many as 30 students have attended a class.


   


  One of those students, Kido Garza of Adrian, is a recurring participant each week.


   


  Garza served in the United States Marine Corps and was part of the Vietnam War. He did not see much, if any, combat.


   


  He said he was drawn to the woodworking program mainly because his wife told him that he needed to get out of the house and find another hobby besides watching hours and hours of football on the television.


   


  He first attended a class in January. Shortly thereafter, the coronavirus pandemic struck and state-mandated shutdowns were put into effect.


   


  From March to about mid-May, the SBWI remained closed to the public. When it finally reopened to the public, Garza was one of the first to return.


   


  "I still don't miss a Wednesday class since it has reopened," he said.


   


  Garza is an example of what many of the veterans can do when involved with the woodworking program.


   


  Since joining, Garza has been able to craft such things as 30-inch, spinning food table made from cherry wood, a decorative wall butterfly made from walnut, wooden gun racks and, perhaps his most personal creation yet, a wooden walking cane with the handle painted to replicate a .45 pistol.


   


  The SBWI also hosts a painting class as well, which Garza attends.


   


  "I cannot say enough about this place," he said. "It is awesome."


   


  What brings Garza back to the woodshop each week is the challenge of starting and finishing a project.


   


  "People tend to underestimate themselves when it comes to be able to do something beyond our normal routine," he said. "I am the same way. The skills you learn here prove that if you think of it, you can make it."


   


  Another piece that Garza recently finished at the woodshop was a walnut and maple chessboard.


   


  On average, he spends about seven hours each Wednesday at the shop.


   


  The wood provided to the woodshop comes from Hardwoods of Michigan in Clinton.


   


  Bill Lewis of Eaton Rapids is another regular at the woodshop.


   


  An Air Force veteran who served from 1974-77, Lewis said he found out about the Woodworking for Warriors Program on Facebook and decided that he would give it a try.


   


  He has been in attendance at the shop since May 2019.


   


  "I have a lot of tools at home, but coming out here seems to rejuvenate my desire to create," he said.


   


  Lewis is currently crafting three custom-made benches that he will be giving to his family for Christmas.


   


  His prized creation from the woodshop thus far is a cherry wood table that he made for his wife.


   


  The table took about one month of dedicated work for Lewis to finish.


   


  Other attendees of the woodshop program have made such creations as cabinets, drums, cutting boards, carvings, knives and even bows.


   


  "All sorts of things have been made here by our participants," Barnett said.


   


  Before anybody is able to work with any of the woordworking equipment, a specialized three- to four-hour training course is required to familiarize students with the tools regularly used in the workshop.


   


  Such tools include blades; table, band and miter saws; and sanders. Various other tools can be used, but those are the basics.


   


  Barnett said it brings him plenty of joy when he sees returning faces each week.


   


  "The fact that a lot of these guys keep coming back speaks to the importance of this program to them," he said.


   


  "Therapy through woodworking" is how Barnett summed up the Woodworking for Warriors program.


   


  As a youth, Barnett did a lot of work for his grandmother, and for doing the work, he would receive an allowance. This began an increase in his workload, and projects, much of which he brought upon himself.


   


  He offered his assistance on very labor intensive jobs for his grandmother, including tree trimming and house siding.


   


  As he grew older, Barnett began working with a remodeling company. It was there that he began to craft his own furniture. Before he knew it, Barnett was making a steady income and his woodworking creations were winning awards around the state and across the country.


   


  The opportunity to bring the Woodworking for Warriors program to Adrian is his way of giving back.


   


  "I have had my successes," he said. "It is also a success to help others."


   


  There is a time at the woodshop for bonding and friendship. An upper level of the woodshop -- away from the work area -- features many wooden seating areas and tables. Several students hang out in this area where food is shared and a hot pot coffee is always on.


   


  Sometimes, Barnett has taken members of the woodworking program out on hunting adventures and other team-building excursions. It's his way, he said, of connecting with the individuals coming to his woodworking program and building an unbreakable level of trust with them and the mission of the Wednesday Woodworking for Warriors program.


   


  A virtual fundraising event for the program is scheduled to take place at 6:30 p.m. on Veterans Day, Nov. 11. Registration for this event can be done online at www.sambeaufordwoodshop.com and clicking on the "Warriors" tab at the top of the page.


   


  All proceeds from the virtual "Vetsgiving" fundraising event will benefit the Woodworking for Warriors program.
