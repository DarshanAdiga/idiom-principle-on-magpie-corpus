Not that I’m not feeling a profound sense of loss. My children, other family members and friends feel unbearably distant despite the discovery that the phone can also be used as a phone and I also miss all my Guardian friends – they are more than colleagues – with whom I have shared an office in Westminster for more than six years. I’d also like to update you on one battle. Last week I wrote that I was at least looking forward to spending some of the refunds I would be getting on opera tickets already booked – the companies made a huge error in asking whether you wanted your money back or would donate the total ticket price as a gift; I would happily have donated 20% but there wasn’t that option – and that my wife was insistent it be put towards mending things around the house that had been broken for years. Well, tough. I went out and bought a pot instead. At times like these, things of beauty win hands down.

An iconic downtown Barnwell pharmacy has filled its last prescriptions and served its final cherry cokes.            Berley's Pharmacy closed its doors for the final time on Wednesday, March 18 after 41 years in business, although a pharmacy has occupied the downtown building since 1901. Owner Berley Lindler Jr. has retired after 41 years of service.            "I want to sincerely express my gratitude for all the continued business and support over the years. It has been an absolute pleasure serving you," said Lindler to his customers.            Berley's Pharmacy has a long history of making people feel better. For some that's come in the form of vital medications to help physical ailments. Many others sought out an ice cream cone or a drink from the old-timey soda fountain as a self-prescribed treat.            "God bless Mr. Berley, Miss Mary Catherine, Emmylou Brown, and all those who served Barnwell for many decades behind those doors on The Circle," said life-long Barnwell resident Owais Khan. His parents, Dr. M.O. and Qumar Khan, were the final customers on the pharmacy's last day.            Lindler purchased the pharmacy in 1979 from the Best family who operated it as Best Pharmacy for many years. However, Lindler's dedication to the Barnwell community goes back even further.            He and his wife, Mary Catherine, moved to Barnwell in 1961 after he graduated from Auburn's pharmacy school. They chose Barnwell because they wanted to raise their family in a small town and had a friend from Denmark who told them about the area.            "We've enjoyed living in Barnwell very much," Lindler said.            He started his career at Modern Drugs with fellow pharmacist Bob Webster. It was located across from Best Pharmacy.            Throughout his 59-year career, Lindler said the people of Barnwell have kept him going. He's enjoyed building relationships with so many people, including customers and other residents.            "I appreciate our customers so much and love each one of them," Lindler said.            The feeling was mutual.            Tabitha Barrett was one of those loyal customers who stopped by on March 18 for a reception hosted by Lindler's children, Berley Lindler III and Renee Nolff. She brought her two children, Ashley and Anthony, who have been coming several times a week for the past three years to get ice cream as a treat for good behavior and good grades. Cookies and cream is their favorite flavor.            "While we have ice cream at home, there's something about them coming here," said Tabitha of the nostalgic atmosphere and friendly service found at Berley's Pharmacy.            Lindler is also loved by his employees - past and present. He has employed many over the years, especially high school students.            Barnwell High student Lauren Nobles is one of the last students to work at Berley's. When Lauren was six years old, she told pharmacy employee Emmylou Brown that she wanted her first job to be at Berley's.            "Lauren has loved eating ice cream at Mr. Berley's since she was a baby. It was only fitting for this to be her first job, although I think she ate more than her wages in chocolate ice cream," said Lauren's mother, Nelsa Nobles. "I am so thankful for Mr. Berley, Emmylou and Brittany giving her this experience and we wish Mr. Berley a very happy retirement."            "He's the best boss I ever had," said Brown, who's worked there for more than 10 years. "I have enjoyed working there and spending time with the young kids to the older generation."            She also has memories of going to Berley's Pharmacy when she was growing up to buy a cherry coke and bubble gum ice cream. She hopes someone will buy the building so future generations can purchase a real cherry coke and ice cream like so many people have over the years.            "I'm happy that Mr. Berley is retiring and praying it will work out for someone who loves the history of Barnwell to be able to hold on to the fountain," she said.            Brittany Wyndham Swearingen, who has worked at Berley's off and on for the 10 years since graduating from Barnwell High School in 2010.            "He is the most kind-hearted person and the sweetest boss. I'm going to miss him," she said.            After a job shadow experience with Lindler during her sophomore year of high school, she knew she wanted to become a pharmacist. She returned to the pharmacy a couple years later to complete her clinicals for the pharmacy tech course at the Barnwell County Career Center.            Swearingen became the first person to work with Lindler behind the counter. She started as a pharmacy technician, but most recently has been a pharmacist since earning her degree.            "He has taught me a lot and showed me that being a pharmacist is a lot more than what the average person thinks. It's more than just counting pills," she said.            Being a pharmacist is also about making sure people take the right medications, handling insurance and trying to help patients as much as they can.            Swearingen said she's enjoyed her years at Berley's Pharmacy, especially forming personal relationships with so many folks and seeing how Lindler has positively impacted so many lives.            "I want to have that same impact," she said.            She has accepted a job at CVS in Barnwell, so she looks forward to continuing to serve the people of her hometown, including many familiar faces from Berley's.            All of Berley's refills and patient profiles have been given to CVS.            The decision to retire is bittersweet, but Lindler said he's looking forward to spending more time with family and friends while also spending time working in his yard.

The song is heavily funk and disco influenced, as the driving beat is accompanied by playful synths and a groovy bass line inspired by bassist Louis Johnson, who famously played on Michael Jackson's _Off The Wall, Thriller,_ and _Dangerous_. Roosevelt further pushes the funky vibe with his vocals, that resonate brightly along with the melody lines. The song is strictly positive vibes, and the retro style of the tune is a refreshing blend of modern electronic and dance infused with 1970's funk and disco that pioneered EDM as we know it today.

Temperatures are into the low to mid 60s under mostly clear to partly cloudy skies. This warmth will continue once again today with temperatures this afternoon climbing back above 80! We will have a few more clouds through the middle of the day today, but overall it should still be a pleasant day for outdoor activities. Wind from the southwest will be breezy once again, gusting at 10 to 20 mph. The record high for today’s date is 86-degrees sent back in 1910 &amp; 1907. Today’s forecast high will be around 85-degrees.Saturday will be a warm day as well. Morning temperatures Saturday will be into the mid 60s and will climb into low 80s for some as we move into the afternoon. Wind Saturday will be breezy with possible gusts of 15 to 20 mph from the south. There will be more cloud cover as we move into the afternoon as a line of storms nears from the west. Storms will more likely move into North Alabama after midnight into Sunday morning. The storms will be weakening as they move east, but there could still be a few stronger storms with gusty winds. That line of storms will bring in some slightly cooler air as we move into early next week.Copyright 2020 WAFF. All rights reserved.

It’s also crossed my mind that the government may actually want to have me killed – sketch writers are probably high on Dominic Cummings’ hit list – and have deliberately kept me misinformed. Anyway, I’m taking no chances. Nor am I entirely reassured by reports from Spain and Italy that under-60s are getting preferential treatment for ventilators. If anyone knows how to doctor a birth certificate, please get in touch. Otherwise I am coping reasonably well, sticking to the rules and cycling up and down the same half-mile hill. I prefer my exercise to be mindless and repetitive, so that suits me fine. The one member of the household to be finding the new restrictions annoying is the dog. Initially he was thrilled to have both my wife and I at home, but now he is getting fed up with being taken for extra walks on the common. He’s also taken to social distancing from us. Normally when we go to bed, he’s the first up the stairs to nab the prime spot on the duvet. Now he’s taken to sleeping at the bottom of the stairs. He needs a bit of me time. It’s come to something when I’m needier than the neediest dog in the world.

 Demand for flour in Europe has increased tremendously since the start of the novel coronavirus pandemic, said the director of the International Association of Operative Millers (IAOM) Eurasia. Following the rapid spread of COVID-19, demand has been high for flour and flour products such as pasta amid the panic, Eren Gunhan Ulusoy told Anadolu Agency. While cafes and pubs have been closed to stem the spread of the virus, bakeries are doing brisk business and bread sales have increased, he said. Turkey's flour and flour products trade has not been affected by the virus so far, but the slowdown in the global economy and increased container costs will affect it in the future, Ulusoy, who is also head of the Turkish Flour Industrialists' Federation (TFIF), highlighted. 'The epidemic does not have a direct effect on food products under the current conditions. I do not expect a problem in wheat or flour production,' he said. As the world's largest flour exporting country, Turkey sold $1.05 billion worth of flour last year. Turkey has high capacity Ulusoy noted that some countries, in which industries generally operate at full capacity already, will see problems in production due to manpower, logistics and hygiene standards due to the outbreak. But 'in our country, the capacity utilization rate is at 50%. In other words, we can produce twice the total flour consumption of Turkey.' He said that even if it takes months to control the pandemic, the flour sector in Turkey will continue production without any problems. 'We are lucky in the raw material side. We planted the wheat in 2019 and we will harvest it this July. In this sense, we do not expect any trouble,' he noted. Flour production to continue Touching on flour consumption in Turkey, he said annual consumption is 160 kilograms per person and the country is one of the largest flour consumers in the world. In the flour sector, 82% of the flour is used by bakeries, while individuals consume only 5% of the total flour in Turkey, he said. The sector increased its capacity to meet rising domestic flour demand after the virus outbreak. 'Our flour industry continues production without interruption to prevent a disruption in flour supply,' he added.

Manchester United will refund supporters if they have to play their remaining home games of the season behind closed doors or if they are scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic.
 The deadline for season ticket renewals for next season has also been suspended, with no indication as to when the current campaign can re-start.
 English football has been suspended until April 30, but a meeting of Premier League clubs next week is expected to push that date further back.
 United would be one of the clubs worst affected should the 2019/20 season fail to be completed as they sit fifth in the Premier League, outside the Champions League places, and are still involved in the latter stages of the Europa League and FA Cup.
 However, Manchester City's two-season ban from European competition could allow their city rivals to qualify for the Champions League if it is upheld for next season.
 "The club fully supports the collective intent to complete the Premier League, FA Cup and the UEFA club competitions," United said in a statement on Friday.
 "However, if it were decided that games cannot be played, or needed to be played behind closed doors, Manchester United confirms it will offer season ticket holders either a pro-rata rebate against their season tickets for next year, or a pro-rata cash refund based on the number of games still to be played.
 "The season ticket renewal deadline, initially 1 May, has been suspended."
 United have also committed to paying 3,000 casual staff for their remaining five home Premier League games even if they are cancelled or played behind closed doors.
 Earlier this month, the Red Devils paid travelling fans £350 ($429) towards travel and accommodation costs when their Europa League last-16, first-leg match against LASK in Austria was forced behind closed doors at short notice.
 "By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances," said Richard Arnold, United's Group Managing Director.
 "They give Manchester United their support year after year, and at this time, we are committed to supporting them. Our message to them is clear -- we are all in this together."

Over the past 18 years, since the world turned its attention to rooting out Al Qaida from the mountains of Afghanistan — through a laboured and difficult process, and through concerted efforts at laying the foundations for a secular state where all minorities and women were treated equally — there have been occasional glimmers of hope that moderation might take root.

I had been wondering for years what kind of person does on-camera meeting. Turns out it's people working from their home office. "Use the camera, at least once in a while," Urdur tells me. "It helps you connect better with your work colleagues and clients. It also helps you quickly get the feeling of the atmosphere - are people bored? Excited? Concerned? Even a short "coffee machine chat" in the morning is more fun on-camera. It helps replicate the office environment."

Con la norma dictada hoy (Comunicación "A" 6937) los bancos quedaron habilitados a aumentar su tenencia de Leliq, siempre y cuando presten a las empresas más del 70% del dinero que les fue liberado en concepto de baja de encajes.              "La medida ajusta los incentivos a las entidades financieras para que potencien la línea de crédito a las pequeñas y medianas empresas para pagar los sueldos de sus empleados", explicó el BCRA en un comunicado esta tarde.              Vale aclarar que el Central le habilitará a los bancos este incentivo "siempre y cuando esas entidades sean agentes de pago de la empresa que lo solicita".              "Esta adecuación busca estimular, en el marco de esa misma línea de créditos y en las mismas condiciones, la disposición de más fondos para préstamos que sean destinados a afrontar el pago de la nómina salarial", aseguró el Banco a cargo de Miguel Pesce.              El jueves pasado, el Central había flexibilizado encajes y puesto nuevos topes a la posición de Leliq para liberar fondos que pudieran ser usados en créditos blandos a empresas y familias, ante las restricciones en el comercio y la producción por las medidas para detener la expansión del coronavirus (Covid-19).              También había permitido que, hasta septiembre de 2020, se añadan 60 días de plazo para cada categoría de deudor y, para sostener la capacidad prestable, se suspenda hasta el 30 de julio la posibilidad de distribución de resultados por parte de las entidades financieras.              "Estas medidas apuntan a que el sistema financiero pueda dar más apoyo tanto a empresas como a particulares y a que no se resienta la cadena de pagos en los próximos meses", informó entonces el BCRA.              En las últimas horas, algunos bancos como el Provincia, el Itaú y el Comafi comenzarón a dar las primeras líneas de crédito a tasa del 24% para el pago de salarios y descuento de cheques, aunque se espera se se sumen otras entidades financieras en los próximos días.

But a century later, the long-distance campaign is back by default. The coronavirus has shut down political campaigning—and virtually everything else. Neither former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, nor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has held in-person events with voters since before the March 10 Michigan primary. President Trump has canceled his rallies for the foreseeable future. Candidates at all levels across the country are adapting and experimenting on the fly, as they wrestle with how to engage supporters, persuade voters, and raise money when many Americans are stuck inside, sick, or out of work. Biden greets his grandkids from his front porch; he’s greeting voters from his basement.

Gaming headsets aren't necessarily under as much stock pressure as something like a webcam, but if you want to know where has a supply of great gaming headphones right now our regularly updated guide can help you track down the right headset today.
 You know the drill, we're stuck at home having to modify the use of our gaming PC so that we can use it to work from home... and maybe not just play games while _pretending_ to work from home. This transition means that a lot of us are having to buy new equipment to make that happen, and the most important kit is that which allows us to keep in touch with other humans.
 Webcams are the trickiest thing to get hold of right now, but a good headset, with a clear microphone, can be the next best thing.
 Thankfully there is still decent stock of audio kit around, so why not take this opportunity to not just get a boring single-ear office headset, but a great gaming headset? For my money that's the HyperX Cloud Alpha, and that's still available for a great price, but check out our full guide to the best gaming headsets for a full run-down of the top cans.
 This list is updated every 30mins to ensure the very latest stock at the very best prices for you lovely people.

"When I need a coffee or take time for lunch, I leave my computer. I do not sit at my desk while I am taking a break, and at the end of the day I sign off and do not use my workspace for anything else." There's a scientific basis for this. "Our brains are wired to associate certain activities with certain places (for example, you might have a particular cafe you go to when you need to power through a task, or remember a certain desk at your university library where you were the most efficient), so the trick is to create a space in your home that has work connotations. Once you have created that space, it's easier to "unplug" everywhere else," Anna explains.

Once it is out of the way, the upside is likely to gain traction with the next focus on the intraday high of $142.02. The next resistance awaits ETH at $142.55 ( March 25 high), while the ultimate bullish goal in the short run is $150.00.

Foreign investors net bought VND30 billion ($1.28 million) worth of stocks on all three of Vietnam’s bourses this session, with buying pressure focused on blue chips of state corporations in banking and oil and gas.
 According to data analysts FiinTrade, with the market plunging in recent weeks, many organizations are taking the opportunity to restructure their portfolios, and buy stocks with good fundamentals at low prices. Some of the stocks have fallen to levels they were trading at during the 2008 global financial crisis.
 Gains this session continued to be supported by the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange’s (HoSE) biggest capped stocks as 241 tickers lost and 105 gained on the bourse, on which the VN-Index is based.
 The VN30-Index for HoSE’s 30 biggest caps lost 0.69 percent, with 18 losing tickers and 12 gaining. However, because the gainers had more market cap than the losers, the VN-Index still closed in the green.
 SBT of agricultural firm TTC-Sugar once again topped gains with 6.7 percent, but VIC stocks of Vietnam’s biggest private conglomerate Vingroup, which gained 6.1 percent, had a much bigger impact on the VN-Index as the latter was the bourses’ biggest capped ticker.
 VIC alone contributed 4.65 points to the VN-Index, higher than the combined impact of the ten biggest losing stocks on HoSE this session, which took 2.71 points from the index, according to data from brokerage firm VNDIRECT.
 It was followed by SAB of Sabeco, the country’s biggest brewer, which surged 3.7 percent. VCB of Vietcombank and CTG of VietinBank, two of Vietnam’s biggest state-owned lenders by assets, rose 1.4 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
 Other major gainers included VRE of Vincom Retail, Vingroups retail subsidiary, up 2 percent, and EIB of Eximbank, the only private bank to have closed in the green, up 1.9 percent.
 In the opposite direction, MWG of electronics retailer Mobile World and HDB of private mid-sized lender HDBank led losses at 6.9 percent each.
 They were followed by ROS of real estate developer FLC Faros, one of the VN30’s most volatile stocks, with 5.8 percent.
 Among those in the red were two tickers of state-owned banks, and three others of private banks. STB of private Sacombank fell the most, with 5.6 percent, followed by MBB of state-owned Military Bank, 3 percent, and TCB of private Techcombank, 0.6 percent.
 Other major losers this session included SSI of brokerage Saigon Securities Inc., shedding 5.6 percent, HPG of steelmaker Hoa Phat Group, 4.4 percent, and BVH of insurance giant Bao Viet Group, 3.8 percent.
 Meanwhile, the HNX-Index for stocks on the Hanoi Stock Exchange, Vietnam’s second main bourse for small and midcap stocks, shed 0.47 percent, and the UPCoM-Index for unlisted public companies slipped 0.37 percent.

These are strange times to be a sketch writer. The only story is coronavirus – who’d have guessed Brexit could take a back seat so quickly? – and there is nothing remotely funny about the pandemic. So I’ve often agonised over what tone to take. Most readers who have got in touch seem to think I have got it about right, but there are some who feel I should be less critical and get more behind the government. My feeling is there should always be room for light relief – I’m using Shakespeare as my role model here – and that now, more than ever, journalists should be allowed to ask members of the government the tough questions. As such, my sketches have tended not to focus on the measures the prime minister has taken but on the ones he hasn’t.

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Claims for unemployment benefits have risen dramatically in Alaska as concerns over the coronavirus have rippled through the state. A state labor department official says claims filed during the latest weekly reporting period totaled 7,806, up from 1,120 the prior week. The state has placed restrictions on the operation of certain businesses and some local governments have imposed restrictions of their own as part of "hunker down" orders. Gov.

The Old Trafford giants have, though, moved to provide clarity for fans should this season's remaining matches be played in front of empty stands or even scrapped, while reviewing season ticket renewals for next season.
 United group managing director Richard Arnold said: "We appreciate the patience and the support we have had from our fans throughout this challenging time and welcome the constructive discussions we have had with MUST and fan representatives.
 "We know our fans will not want to miss any games played in the coming months and will be disappointed if that is to be the case, but clearly we must all play our part in the efforts to combat coronavirus.
 "By pushing the season ticket renewal deadline back and confirming our policy if games were to be cancelled or played behind closed doors, we want to ease any concerns our loyal fans may have in the current circumstances.

His willingness to reach out across the political aisle became apparent when he worked behind the scenes for a salary of $1 a year to get Congress to raise the US debt ceiling during the debt-ceiling crisis of 2011.

Although text and emails are fast and convenient, chatting is more personal - and that can make a difference when working far apart. "If you are used to meeting colleagues at the office, it might be challenging to be alone at home the whole day," says Urdur Anna Bjornsdottir, Senior Consultant, located in Germany. "If you have a question, have a quick call with your colleagues instead of sending a message. When writing we tend to go straight to the point, but during a phone call we get a better chance at showing our personalities, and connecting with others. Something as simple as a call can help keep the team united."

"For a random process, is it true that in the long run, everything washes out and whatever happens will happen regardless of what took place earlier? Or is there a memory of what took place before?" asks Tamuz. "Say you have two societies, and one of them makes some technological advancement while the other suffers a natural disaster. Are these differences going to persist forever, or will they eventually disappear and we'll forget that once there was an advantage? In random walks, it has been long known that there are groups that have these memories while in other groups the memories are erased. But it was not really clear which groups have this property and which don't—that is, what makes a group have memory? This is what we figured out."
