An FDA spokeswoman told CNN the agency had no comment or information to share. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for comment.


  Citing administration officials, the New York Times reported the sales ban would not apply to tank vaping systems common in vape shops.


  Cartridge-based e-cigarettes have been popular among underage users. Juul, the leading e-cigarette maker, has previously stopped selling flavors including mint, mango, creme and cucumber.


  Trump administration officials announced in September the FDA would try to curb a youth vaping epidemic by stripping all flavors except tobacco from the market. US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at the time that flavored-product manufacturers would also have the opportunity to file for approval from the FDA, but their products would be off the market until approved.


  Questions and criticism have followed since then.


  Vaping advocates say a flavor sales ban would curtail some adult smokers' efforts to quit, put small vaping companies out of business and eliminate jobs. A Trump campaign adviser previously told CNN that Trump's political aides have warned him that such a ban may not be helpful with his base and that he should reconsider.


  Health and anti-tobacco advocacy groups have urged the Trump administration to take all flavored products, including menthol, off the market.

North Koreas leader plans to further develop nuclear programmes and to introduce a new strategic weapon in the near future, state media said on Wednesday, although he signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States. Kim Jong Un presided over a four-day meeting of top Workers Party officials this week amid rising tensions with the United States, which has not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. Washington has dismissed the deadline as artificial.Kim said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self- declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBM, according to a statement on the results of the policy meeting carried by the official KCNA news agency. At times smiling or striking the podium with his hand as he made remarks during the meeting, Kim accused the United States of making gangster-like demands and maintaining a hostile policy, such as by holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.He pledged to continue bolstering his countrys nuclear deterrent but said the scope and depth of that deterrent will be properly co-ordinated depending on the attitude of the United States. The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, Kim said, using the initials for North Koreas official name - the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U.S. and guaranteeing our long-term security. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be deeply disappointing if Kim reneges on denuclearisation commitments and Kim would hopefully choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.In his latest comments on Tuesday in the United States, President Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word. He likes me, I like him. We get along. Hes representing his country, Im representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation, Trump told reporters at his Mar-a- Lago club in Florida. Seouls Unification Ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs said large-scale joint military drills with the United States had been halted and it would be unhelpful for negotiations if North Korea took action to introduce what it called a new strategic weapon.There were no official reports as of early afternoon on Wednesday in South Korea that Kim had delivered an annual New Years address.STRATEGIC WEAPONSKim had previously said he might have to seek a new path if Washington failed to meet his expectations. U.S. military commanders said Pyongyangs actions could include test firing an ICBM alongside nuclear warhead tests. North Korea last test fired an ICBM in 2017. Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said it was difficult to predict North Koreas next move. But it might involve firing a solid-fuel ICBM and an atmospheric nuclear test, he said.However, Jeong Han- beom, who teaches security policy at Korea National Defense University in Seoul, said North Korea would not immediately stage such a provocative act as an ICBM or nuclear test because it could risk derailing negotiations. Tension had been rising ahead of the year-end as North Korea conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with Trump.The nuclear talks have made little headway despite three meetings between Kim and Trump since 2018. Working-level talks in Stockholm in October broke down, with a North Korean chief negotiator accusing U.S. officials of sticking to their old stance. Kim said there will never be denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula if Washington adheres to what he calls its hostile policy.We will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built, Kim said. He called for North Koreans to brace for an arduous and prolonged struggle and foster a self-reliant economy because of a delay in the anticipated lifting of sanctions.The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future, too, and to strengthen the internal power from all aspects. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the party assembly results made clear Kim wants U.S. security guarantees before taking substantial action toward denuclearisation.And he is suggesting that he will take the bull by the horns to achieve that goal, while promoting self-reliance at home and still being open to talks depending on how Trump handles hostile policy, Yang said.

Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”

The president has never been popular judged in a vacuum. In 2016, he won GOP primaries with pluralities and lost the general election popular vote. As president, he's never reached majority job approval in Gallup's polling. But he’s still hovering in the 40s, not far from where his immediate predecessors were 11 months before winning second terms. Impeachment proceedings haven’t affected Trump’s standing. Meanwhile, the same Democratic-run House that impeached him approved his new North America trade pact. Top-line economic numbers shine, even if the on-ground reality is uneven. And Trump could be on the cusp of a peace deal in Afghanistan after the Taliban ruling council on Sunday agreed to a temporary cease-fire. As frenetic as Trump’s messaging is, he proved in 2016 that he relishes framing binary choices for voters, and he’s more than convinced he has a case in 2020.

I started smoking in high school and quit in my early 20s. I wish I never smoked, but I did. I thought it was cool until I knew it was stupid. That's when I quit.


   


  Laws that restricted the sale of cigarettes to those 18 or older didn't stop me. Because 18-year-olds can buy for younger teens, anti-tobacco advocates supported raising the legal age of purchase to 21 to make it harder for 16-year-olds to get their hands on tobacco and e-cigarettes.


   


  That's what Congress and President Donald Trump did as the year ended. With little debate while the country was focused on impeachment, they raised the legal age to buy cigarettes and vaping products to 21 by tucking the provision into the $738 billion Defense Spending Act.


   


  Was there robust debate over Washington treating adults who are old enough to vote and old enough to fight in the U.S. military as children who can't make adult decisions?


   


  (Given support on both sides of the aisles for the federal drinking age of 21, along with the 21-year age for the ownership of firearms in some states, the horse is out of the barn.)


   


  Was there any hesitation about Washington abrogating states' rights by imposing a 21-year-old smoking age preferred by 19 states, including California, on the majority of states that have passed no such laws?


   


  Hardly. "Stakeholders," which included tobacco and vaping interests, supported the old-enough-to-vote-but-not-old-enough-to-smoke provision as a sop to stave off attempts to ban flavored vaping products and menthol cigarettes.


   


  Clearly, industry leaders believe that getting rid of flavors would be worse for their business model than a 21-year-old rule for buyers.


   


  Only cranks such as me, who believe in adult rights for adult voters, even think to protest.


   


  Wisconsin radio talk-show host Vicki McKenna, 51, counts herself among those who have issues with two ages of adulthood -- 18 and 21 -- but, as one of the millions of former smokers who kicked the habit when she started vaping, she is willing to accept the higher smoking age as the lesser of two evils.


   


  Her mother and grandmother died of lung cancer. After smoking a pack a day for 23 years, McKenna quit smoking 10 years ago after starting to vape flavored e-cigarettes. Banning e-cigarettes, or their flavors, she argues, would be hazardous to her health.


   


  When she started using e-cigarettes, vaping was not a big political target. That changed, as McKenna sees it, in 2019 when an outbreak of lung disease put more than 2,400 vapers in hospitals, and horribly killed some 54.


   


  The media took a closer look at the practice of manufacturers using flavors to entice kids to vape.


   


  Later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that most patients with vaping-related lung damage had used products that contained THC, the ingredient that creates the high in marijuana. It became clear that the culprit in these premature deaths was not bubble-gum flavors marketed by big corporations but the black market.


   


  But flavors were on the media's radar, and the nation's politicians felt they had to do something.


   


  Flavored vape products may well have been banned; Trump was heading in that direction.


   


  Then an October survey by McLaughlin Associates showed that vapers in battleground states ardently oppose "banning flavors in all nicotine vapor products" and 83% of them were likely to vote based solely on a candidate's stand on vaping products.


   


  The poll also found that by a ratio of 3-to-1, battleground state vapers supported raising the vaping age to 21.


   


  So Washington raised the national smoking and vaping age to 21, with the industry's blessing, to vapers' relief and few frowns from the opining class.


   


  According to an August Gallup poll, even Americans in the 18-21 age group supported a 21-year-old smoking age by a 2-to-1 margin. They'd vote that they're too young to choose to smoke.


   


  So it's popular. But is it right?


   


  The message from Capitol Hill: 18-year-olds are old enough to choose their government and old enough to die for it, but they are not old enough to make adult decisions on smoking or drinking. There are two ages of adulthood, depending on the situation.


   


  At the same time, many progressives are pushing to lower the voting age to 16, which would be five years sooner than these teens would be able to purchase a glass of wine legally.


   


  Don't they realize where their argument is heading? The subliminal message is that voting is a no-brainer. And if being under 21 makes you too young to make personal decisions, maybe it's too young to vote.

Political newcomer and congressional candidate David Richter is impressing many with the money he is spending both to fund his campaign and contribute to others’ campaigns, but residents in District 2 should do some research into this unknown player. Richter is a recent “resident” in our district, with a home in Princeton where his family lives, and a property in Avalon he rents. One might question how he can represent the citizens of the district when he has little connection to or investment in it.
 Not only is Richter relatively new to the area, but he comes with no history in elected office, which doesn’t provide much to go on to get to know him. His résumé is centered around being a job creator and successful businessman at Hill International. While Richter says he turned a small family business into a thriving company, Hill was already an international company when he became president in 2004, and the company’s stock was lower at the time of his departure.
 More importantly, his tenure there has what I consider some serious red flags. In 2010, during the Obama administration, Hill International welcomed Joe Biden’s brother to a leadership role in the company; seven months later they landed a $1.5 billion contract for construction in Iraq. The presence of the vice president’s brother should make the cronyism obvious.
 The Atlantic City area has historically been victimized by outsiders who want to take advantage of its assets to enrich themselves and their circle of friends. Do citizens of this district really want a congressional representative who is an out-of-towner who already seems to have used a political connection to enrich himself?

  Wichita was held to just 6 shots in the third, but had some quality scoring chances. The best came from Beau Starrett as he toe-dragged around a defender and fired a wrist shot that Nick Schneider stopped. Time winded and overtime was needed.


  Hults scored the game-winner at 52 seconds of the OT as he walked off the wall and fired a backhand up off the bar past Gillam.

Australia’s Nathan Lyon on Monday shot down a suggestion from Shane Warne that he take a rest for the Sydney Test against New Zealand this week so leg- spinner Mitchell Swepson can make his debut.


  Tim Paine’s team have already won the three-match series against the Black Caps after crushing them by 247 runs in Melbourne on Sunday, following their comprehensive win in Perth.


  Cricket great Warne has championed Swepson and over the weekend flagged the idea of axing Lyon if selectors opt for one spinner in Sydney.


  “Just giving Mitchell Swepson a taste of it, giving him a chance, I reckon it will pay dividends in the long run,” Warne said.


  But Lyon, who took four wickets on Sunday to wrap up late New Zealand second innings resistance, said there was no way he would be standing aside.


  “Did Warnie ever want a rest and give Stuart MacGill a go?” he asked, noting the lack of opportunity given to Warne’s leg-spin rival at the height of their careers.


  “I won’t be resting. I haven’t met any Australian cricketers that would like to be rested. It’s that hard playing Test cricket, but it’s that rewarding as well so every opportunity you get to play cricket for Australia it means the world to us. So I can’t imagine Mitch Starc, Pat (Cummins) or Patto (James Pattinson) putting his hand up to say I need a rest.”


  Queensland’s Swepson has been added to Australia’s squad for Sydney, where conditions often assist slow bowlers, and was taking tips from Warne in Melbourne.


  There is a chance that Australia will play two specialist spinners in the third Test, with the call to be made after Paine and selectors look at the pitch.


  Swepson, who has taken 12 wickets from six Sheffield Shield games at 26.58, was a member of Australia’s Test squad for tours of India and Bangladesh in 2017 but has yet to make his debut.


  Lyon said if both of them played, he would be more than happy. “Mitch has been bowling brilliantly for Queensland,” he said.


  “He’s a great fella to start off with, but he gives it a rip and that’s what I really love to see. I’m a big fan of Mitch, it’s great to see him in and around our squad so he gets his chance and fingers crossed we can have a great combination together.”


  If Australia go down that road, they would almost certainly retain Cummins, Starc and Pattinson, meaning a batsman would be axed with Matthew Wade the likely candidate after Travis Head scored a century in Melbourne.

How wrong she was.


  A native of Ruan, Co Clare, O’Halloran was born with spina bifida. But as to how she ended up in a wheelchair, there’s a little more to her story.


  Having shattered her kneecap when falling in the schoolyard at the age of 13, and with subsequent attempts at reconstruction failing to do the trick, O’Halloran underwent knee replacement surgery in her early twenties.


  An infection, which took hold less than a year later, meant a second knee replacement was required. This latest knee, however, “kept clicking in and out”, and so eight years ago, O’Halloran had her third and final knee replacement.


  In between the second and third replacements, the Clare County Council employee began using a wheelchair in going about her everyday life.

 GAYLORD LINDAL (December 21, 1931 - December 27, 2019) Unexpectedly at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, at the age of 88 on Friday, December 27, 2019. Born in Santa Monica, California, Gaylord grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Gifted with a brilliant mind, he skipped two grades and began attending the University of California at Los Angeles at the age of sixteen before transferring to the University of Manitoba. In 1951, Gaylord moved to Toronto, Ontario to build his life. With only fifty dollars in his pocket, Gaylord started his company, Viceroy Homes Ltd., which would grow to become one of the great Canadian success stories. Among other accolades, Viceroy Homes Ltd. was honoured as the Canadian Export Awards' first-ever Exporter of the Year, presented by Canada's Minister of International Trade in 1999. We take comfort in knowing that Gaylord lived a truly full life. In his personal life, he was a world traveller; a marathon runner; an adventure seeker; a black belt in karate; a voracious reader; an avid golfer, and one of the earliest members of The Donalda Club; a classic jokester; and the deeply loved patriarch of his family. Gaylord will be dearly missed by his loving wife of 32 years, Sharon, who devoted herself to ensuring that he could spend his final years in the comforts of his beloved home. He will be fondly remembered by his children, Christopher, Dianne, Reigh, Gaylen (David Kelusky) and Donna. Dad took immense pride over the course of his life in his ability to provide his children the best educations possible. For that, and for innumerable other kindnesses over the years, his children are deeply grateful. Gaylord is survived by his grandchildren, Jessica, Nicholas, Mitchell and Roberta; and his great-grandchildren Rex, Arabella, and Rachael. He was predeceased by his granddaughter, Jennifer; his parents, Hannes Lindal and Sigrun Helgason; and his siblings Pearl, Violet, and Hannes.

 A few years ago, my family and I visited the San Antonio Riverwalk between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was decorated with twinkling Christmas lights and glittery trees, and mariachi bands played festive holiday music.  
 We expected the Riverwalk to be crowded. What we didn't expect was the great sea of college football fans. Our visit just happened to fall on the weekend before the Alamo Bowl game. Everywhere, we saw face-painted fans wearing purple and white for Northwestern or yellow and black for the University of Missouri. We couldn't even get tickets for a riverboat ride--they were sold out. Entire college bands floated down the river playing their school's fight songs, followed by boatloads of football players.  
 We figured since we couldn't ride the boats, we'd just enjoy from the sidelines. So when the Northwestern band floated past, followed by the Northwestern football players, we yelled, \"Go Northwestern!\" The players waved and cheered back at us.  
 A few minutes later, when the University of Missouri band and players floated by, guess what we did? My mama didn't raise no fool.  
 We yelled and cheered for the University of Missouri. Our little family was quite possibly the most popular family on the Riverwalk that evening.  
 We didn't have a dog in that fight, so we really didn't care who won. I'm glad we didn't have to choose. While my choice of college football teams doesn't really matter, I make many choices each day that matter a lot.  
 As I think about my new resolutions for my new year, I'm reminded that my goals are pretty meaningless if I don't back them up with choices. Those extra pounds I want to lose? My choice. No one forces me to eat potato chips and chocolate truffles. I make choices about what I eat; therefore, to some extent, I make the choice about what I weigh.  
 What about that next book I want to write? That garage I want cleaned out? Those friendships I want to build? They can become reality if I make the choices, day by day, step by step to achieve my goals. Otherwise, they will remain exactly what they are - lofty dreams. (And yes, a clean garage is a lofty dream for me. Have you seen my garage?)  
 This year, I want to stop talking about my goals and actually achieve some of them. In order to do that, I'll try to make better choices. I know my goals won't be met in one fell swoop, but in small steps. Over time. One small choice after another.

That poses the prospect of a “brain drain” of talented Taiwanese to the advantage of China’s economy while furthering Beijing’s goal of breaking down resistance to the possibility of future political unification between the sides. Recent surveys show around 80 percent of Taiwanese reject the idea of political union with China, with most backing the island’s current status of de facto independence.


  Tsai is favored to win a second term during elections for president and the legislature on Jan. 11.


  China cut contacts with Tsai’s government shortly after her 2016 election and her potential reelection raises the possibility Beijing will intensify its campaign of economic, military and diplomatic pressure over her refusal to agree to Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is a piece of Chinese territory that must be reclaimed. China threatens to use force to annex the island if peaceful means fail.


  In Beijing, the head of the Cabinet’s Taiwan Affairs Office, Liu Jieyi, warned of “serious damage” to Taiwanese interests if the island’s government did not fall in line with China’s demands.


  “The bright prospect for the peaceful development of cross-strait relations needs the joint efforts by compatriots on both sides across the Strait and needs Taiwan compatriots to correctly grasp (the situation),” Liu said in a statement issued by his office.


  While Liu restated China’s contention that unification between the sides is inevitable, he did not reiterate Beijing’s threat to bring that about by force. In his new year’s eve address, president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping also avoided repeating his previous references to the military option, possibly in hopes of not further alienating voters from the China-friendly opposition parties.

DES MOINES, Iowa (WHO/CNN) - An Iowa mother wants to warn others about a face mask sold at stores like Target and Ulta after she says it burned her stepdaughter’s face.Chelsea Anders says her stepdaughter only had the Vitamin C Glow-boosting Unicorn Paper Mask on for about two minutes. The girl said it felt like it was burning, and Anders told her to take it off right away.“Her face was welted with red, swollen, itchy, raised abrasions. I had first thought chemical reaction. It’s what a lot of people had assumed when using this product was that it was just an allergic reaction. Then, doing the research after I had seen what had happened, it looks like a chemical burn,” Anders said.Chelsea Anders says her stepdaughter only had the face mask on for about two minutes before she had a reaction to it.The mask is made by the company Yes To, and it is sold at several stores, including Target and Ulta.One hundred reviews from other customers on the Ulta website say they also had reactions to the mask, and there is even a YouTube video review showing the reaction in real-time.Anders says the way the face mask is marketed is concerning because it suggests users be at least 18 years old but features unicorns. She ultimately wants the product to be recalled.The Vitamin C Glow-boosting Unicorn Paper Mask is made by the company Yes To and sold at several stores, including Target and Ulta.“The reviews about children, the same reaction is happening in adults, so suggested ages really isn’t a point to say I understand the difference in the skin care. But your target marketing is definitely children, and if you are suggesting 18 and older, why are you targeting unicorns at 18 and older?” she said.Iowa Dermatology Clinic Nurse Practitioner Christina Warren examined the ingredients in the product.“There was lactic acid in it, fragrance in it, vitamin C, which is a powerful antioxidant that we usually recommend for aging skin or sun-damaged skin. It’s probably not appropriate for younger children,” she said.Warren says a good rule of thumb is to stay away from paper masks that cover the entire face and use a product with which you can easily do a spot test.“Just test a corner of your skin, like maybe on the jawline, and give it some time, even a few days. Because if you have a delayed reaction, you want to make sure that your whole entire face isn’t going to react,” she said.Copyright 2020 WHO-DT, Ulta.com, Anders Family via CNN.

“But honestly I cannot tell you. We have Winks and Sissoko back from suspension and I don’t think we are going to have anyone back from injuries.”


  Saints boss Ralph Hasenhuttl has called on his defence to firm up so the club do not become over-reliant on star striker Danny Ings.


  Ings has netted 12 times in 16 Premier League appearances this season to propel Saints out of the relegation zone and raise the prospect of an England call-up.


  He was named on the bench for the 2-0 win at Chelsea on St Stephen’s Day to reduce his workload but will start Wednesday’s home clash with Tottenham.


  Hasenhuttl’s team have struggled at the other end, however, with only rock- bottom Norwich having conceded more top-flight goals than Saints’ 38 in 20 games so far.


  “We have a few players who can score and, in the end, it’s also about getting less goals going against us,” the Austrian said.


  “We had a clean sheet against Chelsea and it was a good performance in the defence against Crystal Palace (1-1 draw on Saturday) — we didn’t give them a lot of chances.


  “Sometimes this is more important for me than the fact Ings scores every game. Danny took a rest against Chelsea. He’s working much more for the team at the moment.”

Locally, of course, it marks the beginning of Mayor Paul Heroux’s second term, which he won in a convincing landslide despite a sometimes tumultuous two years as he clashed with other Attleboro officials, including several members of the city council who backed his opponent.


  We expressed the hope after the city election that, with a solid victory under his belt, the mayor could afford to be a little less thin-skinned about every perceived slight and conflict. However, even before the start of his new term, Heroux has already begun a campaign that seems likely to spark another fight — removing veteran traffic study commission Chairperson Joe Caponigro, despite reappointing him to a three-year term just nine months ago.


  On the brighter side, this could also be the year that the long-awaited, often anticipated and usually overhyped revitalization of the city’s downtown finally gets underway.


  The success of that enterprise, however, depends in part on the progress made on another long-running saga, solving the woes of the MBTA, which continue to impact the economy and tax the patience of riders, including thousands in this area who depend on the commuter rail system to get to work, school and medical care.


  One area to watch will be whether a pilot project that brought regular rail service to Foxboro will gain enough riders to be sustainable.


  We’re hoping that’s the case.


  And speaking of Foxboro, it could be a grim few months for the local NFL franchise, whose fortunes have become inextricably linked to its adopted hometown.

“We try and do several events over winter break,” she said. “ We wanted the kids have things to do when they’re out of school and this year we just decided that a Harry Potter party might be fun because everybody loves Harry Potter and they always seem to have movie marathons on around Christmas.”


  Kirking, herself, is not a Harry Potter fan, but still had a lot of fun preparing for the party and helping out at the party. She got a greater appreciation for Harry Potter after discussing it with party volunteers.


  “I do appreciate Harry Potter,” she said. “I’ve seen all the movies and fantasy is not really my thing, but I appreciate why it’s so popular. One of the things people get out of it is the strong sense of friendship between the main characters. I think that’s what keeps people coming back for more adventures with Harry, Ron and Hermione.”


  The volunteers helping out at the party said they were huge Harry Potter fans. Teenager Madison Baskett managed the “fish out a house from the pot.” Kids Kids took a string with a magnet attached to a wand and then had to say “wingardium leviosa” to see what house they got on paper.


  One little boy loved the fact that he got two houses, but then Baskett encouraged him to try to get one house. He was dismayed at the house he got. He said he wanted Slytherin and not Gryffindor, but happily went on his way.


  Baskett loved managing the game and dressing up. Her house is Slytherin, but she had a Gryffindor robe on because she couldn’t find a Slytherin robe. Nonetheless, she was happy to volunteer for the rest of the afternoon. She loved the costumes and introducing others to Harry Potter.


  “I hope they get into it like I got into it,” Baskett said. “I love this series, I love the magical elements to it.”


  Maria Russo, another volunteer managed Quidditch. It this particular one, kids had three chances to throw the ball into one of the rings. If they made it into all three rings, they got a stamp that represented the different houses.


  Younger kids stopped to ask her about Harry Potter which is what made Russo smile. She wanted to volunteer to expose others to Harry Potter.

CNN has reached out to Juul for comment. Juul has previously noted its action to prevent youth vaping, including halting sales of flavors, implementing age verification tools and supporting legislation to bring the legal age to use tobacco to 21.


  Stanton Glantz, director of University of California, San Francisco's Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, said that the reported sales ban is "better than nothing" to curb youth vaping, but likely will have less of an impact than the outright flavor ban originally promised.


  "It is a step forward. Although menthol is by far and away the most important flavor and what the evidence is showing is when you get rid of the other flavors, kids just go to menthol," Glantz said.


  Additionally, "the fact that they are exempting the tank systems is very concerning because there is even less quality control on the tank systems than the closed systems," he said, noting that tank systems are currently a "relatively small" part of the vaping market.


  In December, the sweeping spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law included a measure that prohibits the sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 21. As of last week, the FDA said on its website, "it is now illegal for a retailer to sell any tobacco product -- including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes -- to anyone under 21."


  CNN's Michael Nedelman, Jacqueline Howard and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.

Last month Florida's bigger citrus-growing operations repelled a bid to jack up the intra-industry tax rate that supports the state Citrus Department, and its marketing program that promotes the Sunshine State's best known agricultural product: oranges and the juice they yield.
   
 The major growers convinced the Citrus Commission to hold the tax rate constant - even though the proposed tax hike for each "box" of citrus would have raised the rate to just half of what growers paid as recently as 2016.
   
 Advocates for the tax increase - a hefty 71% jump above the current levy - argued it was necessary to replenish a marketing fund sapped of resources by state lawmakers. The Citrus Department spends about a third of its $15 million annual budget marketing orange juice. But many in the industry maintain that's insufficient to reach consumers in major media markets.
   
 So now smaller orange growers assert they're feeling squeezed - and may not remain in the industry much longer. Which in some cases could mean selling out to a bigger citrus operation, thus producing more consolidation while reducing the diversity within the industry, or, a worse outcome, clearing the way for new development.
   
 We had encouraged the commission to embrace the tax. An infusion of more advertising resources was necessary to educate the American public that the rumored demise of Florida OJ was exaggerated.
   
 Fortunately, state Sen. Ben Albritton has offered a way forward from this vote.
   
 This month the Wauchula Republican, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee, introduced legislation that would create the Friends of Florida Citrus Advisory Council.
   
 The proposed five-person board would include three reps from the citrus industry, including growers and processors, and two at-large members. Perhaps its most vital function, according to Albritton's bill, would be to "identify and pursue methods to provide resources and materials for the programs" that would protect and promote "the quality and reputation of Florida citrus fruit" and related products.
   
 The council could accomplish that by accepting private donations - a practice that is not expressly written into current law, according to Albritton.
   
 A couple of points as to why this is a good idea.
   
 First, regardless of the size of their operation, those involved in growing oranges or making OJ face enough hurdles without including among them a paucity of marketing resources.
   
 One impediment is the continuing campaign to paint OJ as a health risk - because of its inherent sugar content - rather than a health benefit.
   
 As The Ledger reported last week, Gail Rampersaud, a retired University of Florida dietitian and Citrus Department adviser, briefed commissioners on research that rebuts the idea that OJ contributes to the world's obesity problem. She noted that some findings maintain that moderate OJ consumption does not increase blood sugar or insulin levels, or the risk of Type 2 diabetes. In fact, Rampersaud added, drinking OJ may reduce factors contributing to heart disease.
   
 Yet as Commissioner Marty McKenna observed at the session, "These facts are not going to get out and help the Florida grower," unless there is money for marketing.
   
 He's right. Thus, the benefit of Albritton's plan, if enacted, is that the advisory council can solicit funding, including from major growers who might have supported the tax hike.
   
 The other positive aspect of a new advisory council is that its two at-large members could be people outside the industry who are health experts, advertising gurus, or business leaders. Citrus growers may profit from advice offered by those friendly to, but with distance from, the industry itself.
   
 If lawmakers are unwilling to adequately fund the marketing effort for Florida OJ, they should do the next best thing, and let the industry and other private donors do so.

 Imagine if sleeping were to get you thrown in jail. Or sitting and lying down in public. Or camping. Or snoozing in your car.
 In cities across the country, that is exactly what is happening to homeless people who engage in these activities. In an effort to clean up their cities and make residents and visitors more comfortable, lawmakers have taken an inhumane approach to homelessness and made all these actions illegal.
 So, in addition to having no place to live and not enough to eat, homeless people also end up locked up and saddled with criminal records and legal fines that push them further into an endless cycle of poverty.
 Civil liberties advocates have challenged these laws, arguing they violate the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. This month, they were handed a victory from the Supreme Court, which declined to let stand a lower court ruling banning people from sleeping in public when shelters are full.
 We hope the high court's decision will make other cities think twice about adopting such laws, which punish people for their predicament.
 A study released last week by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty found the number of cities with such regulations is growing rapidly. In 2019, 83% of 187 cities had at least one law that restricted begging in public. Of these cities, 55% have one or more laws prohibiting sitting or lying down in public, and 51% had at least one law restricting sleeping in public.
 Currently, 72% of the cities have at least one law restricting camping in public. There are even laws that prohibit people from sleeping in their cars.
 Widespread sleeping and loitering bans are cruel when homeless people have no choice but to sleep outside. If cities don't have enough shelters for the homeless, they can't get mad when people find whatever patch of grass or sidewalk that is available.
 Otherwise, where exactly are homeless people supposed to sleep? Should the 2,500 people in the city of Baltimore who may have no place to lay their head from night to night doze in the waters of the Inner Harbor? Or perhaps floating in midair or in a tree? Or maybe they should never sleep at all? We didn't think so.
 These laws that criminalize the homeless only mask the problem -- and do nothing to help people. They are more about making an uncomfortable problem invisible to those who don't want to admit it exists.
 On top of that, in many cities it just overburdens the jails and courts to have to process people for such trivial indiscretions. Law enforcement resources should be spent on other priorities, such as carjackings, burglaries and solving homicides.
 Some city officials have argued that shelters are dangerous and overcrowded. Hopefully, the Supreme Court's decision will force cities into finally increasing their affordable housing stock -- whether it is through tiny house programs or affordable apartment buildings.
 Let's put people in real homes and not jail houses.

City have always tried their level best to make things as hard for themselves as they can possibly be. A club so contrary they could almost be relied upon to beat themselves without the aid of opposition. There was a time when this contrariness threatened to run riot completely.


  Stuart Pearce played goalkeeper David James up front against Middlesbrough in a game City needed to win to qualify for Europe, with predictably hilarious consequences.


  Sven Goran Eriksen closed out his City managerial career with an 8-1 reverse at Middlesbrough (let’s face it, nobody loses 8-1 to Middlesbrough), and Jamie Pollock produced Bergkampesque poise and precision to lob his own goalkeeper and help the club over the precipice to a first ever visit to the third division.


  Chairman Peter Swales sacked then manager Mel Machin for “a lack of repartee” with the crowd. When violence came to football, City fans showed up with inflatables. It is sometimes difficult to put your finger on exactly what it is, but it is in many ways one hell of a weird club.


  However, an unlikely and slightly alien process has been underway at the Etihad for some time now. It has taken shape in a kind of descaling exercise, like a snake shedding its skin.

Welcome back. Continuing from last week's column, what kind of person can draw two past Oklahoma governors, George Nigh and Frank Keating to a Christmas party at his house, along with Garth Brook's guitarist Ty England, champion bronc rider Billy Etbauer and a dozen more well-known folks? Well, as I promised to tell you last week, they all came to see a man whose home is now in Yukon, Oklahoma but his story doesn't start in Oklahoma though but rather in a small town called Duvall just outside of Seattle, Oregon. The date was May 14, 1940 and the occasion was the birth of a baby boy but life started out rough. With a father who milked cows for a living and a mother who suffered a crippling nervous breakdown soon after his birth, the boy was raised mostly by his sister who was only four years older. Religion always played a big role in the boy's early years but in 1949 after attending a revival meeting led by Christian crusader Billy Graham his faith became central in his life.


   


  An athlete in school, the boy exceled in several sports as well as academics, eventually graduating from Pacific University in Seattle in 1962. He went on to the University of Edenborough in Scotland which had the world's foremost seminary. While he was studying there he also worked part-time and traveled through much of Europe, making many new friends whom he is still close to sixty years later.


   


  After graduation the boy, who was now a young man, moved back home to Duvall where he started working and got married but he had bigger dreams. First of all, he wanted to serve god, then he wanted to help other people and have his own herd of cows. All of this would come to him but not without hard work.


   


  He got the perfect job to help other people at Acme Personnel and from sun up to way past sundown he worked finding employment for people who needed it. In 1968 Acme offered him a job in Oklahoma which he took. By now Acme was the largest job placement company in the country but financial trouble was brewing for the firm.


   


  With good credit, a proven work ethic and he would say god's help, the young man bought Acme Personnel and turned it into Express Employment Professionals. It was a big gamble and for several years during the early 1980s it looked like the new company might not make it.


   


  There was also another problem because this full-grown man could not restrain himself when it came to giving to others. By the 1990s he had his own ranch and as was his way, became particularly interested in helping young people get involved in farming and ranching donating millions in scholarships over the years but he supported many other endeavors as well. From the arts to feeding the hungry, he was willing to chair any worthwhile event or organization that benefited others.


   


  Meanwhile his stature in the business community continued to grow and along the way he was invited to become a director and then chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. Yes, the boy who had wanted to help others had achieved all he dreamed of and even today as he has gotten older, he still wants to assist those in need.


   


  Friends his work in life has not gone unnoticed and last Sunday was a tribute by his friends who came from near and far to wish this man, Yukon, Oklahoma's own Bob Funk, a Merry Christmas. Now you know the rest of this Christmas story and if you want to learn more about Mr. Funk check out the Express Employment Professionals website.


   


  You can also make a visit to the Copan Cafe and out in the back pasture are some of Bob's prize-winning cattle that cafe owners John and Donna Chaney bought from Bob's Express Ranches.


   


  Next week a story about a rancher from Bartlesville and how he made his way into the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.

The club has binned the pistol it used to employ for shooting at its own feet and waved the flag of reliability instead.

  The team picture where two members of the coaching staff lining up alongside each other with their respective initials spelling D.E. B.T. (Dave Ewing and Bill Taylor) would need Clive Allen and Steve Hodge to attempt a similarly relevant visual quip.


  The club is now one of the most well-oiled machines in world football.


  So, when the owners profess to a burning desire to make hay while the Champions League sun shines, you can bet your last dirham that this is exactly where focus has been rerouted.


  City’s last two titles have been delivered in a manner that allows no copying, although Liverpool are free to see how far they get with it. Four titles in the last 10 years, plus a welter of other shiny baubles and unforgettable moments.

  “It’s something the players have taken on board and putting in the week. We’ve seen what the outcome can be. I think going forward if we stick to that we will have a lot of success.”

  It's around this time of year that people look back on the past 12 months and make plans for the future. But this New Year's is not just the end of 2019 - it's the end of a decade too, the end of the 2010s.


  And I'd like to say good riddance.


  My family started the decade as a tiny, new family of three, soon to become four, then later five. But it was not easy.


  First, tumors took my husband's hearing away in 2010, and there was surgery after surgery until, finally, a device implanted in his skull now lets him hear. For that, we are thankful.


  And in 2011 there was the EF4 tornado that made a nearly 6-mile gash across our town, which included our beloved neighborhood where we still live. I was six months pregnant at the time and I had to climb over giant oak trees to see if our house was still standing. It was.


  All of our beautiful, giant oaks had fallen parallel to the house, and we were one of only a handful in our neighborhood without major damage. To this day, I miss the giant trees and all that shade. But I realize that good does come from bad: My kids now play in the neighborhood playground across the street almost daily on a lot that was donated to the neighborhood. A home stood on that lot before the tornado.


  The decade was tough for us. There was a health scare for my toddler son, when we thought he might have leukemia in 2014, but he ended up with a platelet disorder instead. There were miscarriages. And then, when I was finally pregnant with our last baby in 2015, I was diagnosed with melanoma. The cancer required surgery and a skin graft while I was 25 weeks pregnant. I was terrified, but thankful that it was caught early. Almost five years later, I'm still here.


  This year has quite possibly been the hardest of all the decade, as we were hit with the loss of our beloved dog, my 96-year-old grandmother and my dad all within two months of each other. One thing I loved the most was talking to my dad on long road trips. He'd call late at night, with him on the California time zone, and we'd chat about the kids. Of all the people in my life, he was the one I confided in the most, since he never judged and was the best listener. It's been eight months since he died, and I still have moments where I think, \"Oh, I need to call Dad and tell him ... \" and then I realize that I can't.


  Yes, 2019 has been rough.


  But like every year, and every decade, there is good that comes with the bad. I started the decade as a new mom with an infant daughter, and am ending it was a 10-year-old girl who is on the verge of middle school, a young lady who I can see blossoming into her own person, someone who cares so deeply for others. This decade has brought me my son, now 8, who is possibly the sweetest boy I've ever met, and my youngest daughter, who at 4 is a fireball who I can already tell will dominate a boardroom one day. She will give us a run for our money in her teen years.


  This decade brought me the births of my children, diaper changes, first steps, first words, first days of kindergarten. It's brought us ballet recitals and soccer games, Legos and Barbies - and so much laughter and joy and even tears than I ever expected as a mother.


  No year is going to be perfect. Some years will be worse than others, and 2019 has certainly put our family through the ringer. But like everything, there is good that comes with the bad. And looking back on the hard times that have happened over the last decade, we are so thankful for all the joy. And now, we look forward to the next decade, and all that it may bring.


  Here's wishing you and yours a very happy 2020.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Reach her at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.

Good morning, troops. It's Tuesday, Dec. 31.
 Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace conducted an end-of-the-season news conference Tuesday regarding his sorry excuse for an NFL team.
 Sorry for editorializing a bit. But anybody who watched the Bears play this season, which ended Sunday, can be forgiven for the frustration.
 The Bears beat the Minnesota Vikings 21-19 in the season finale to finish 8-8. Bear in mind the Vikings, who are headed to the playoffs, fielded plenty of non-starters in that game.
 The so-what victory over the Vikes -- coached by Mike Zimmer, who was born in Peoria -- culminated a season of disappointment for the Bears, who last year were 12-4 and won their division.
 Despite the double-doink early exit from the playoffs, big things were expected from the team and from quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.
 None of that came to pass, so to speak. In fact, the Bears and Trubisky regressed.
 Pace has a lot to which to answer. Here's hoping Bears chairman George McCaskey, who also participated in a media scrum Tuesday, prepped him well regarding how to handle a somewhat-hostile press corps.
 After all, McCaskey once was a media member -- in Peoria, of course, because this is the Center of the Universe (TM).
 McCaskey is in his early 60s, eighth-oldest among the 11 children of Virginia McCaskey, the principal owner of the Bears, who on Sunday turns 97. She is the eldest child of Bears founder and former coach George Halas.
 It's obvious, then, that football is in George McCaskey's blood. But that hasn't been his only interest.
 After he graduated from Arizona State University with bachelor's and law degrees, McCaskey pursued a career in journalism. He had been a sports reporter for the ASU student newspaper.
 But TV reporting is what led him to Peoria in the early 1980s, at WEEK-TV (25). There he met his future wife and covered local news.
 Among the stories McCaskey covered in 1981 was the annual Christmas present East Bluff resident Ed Clinch received -- a coconut.
 The practical joke was perpetrated on Clinch from 1948 until 1997, when Clinch died. His family was behind the deliveries. They were done in unusual fashion.
 Helicopters, relay teams, animals and people dressed as Santa Claus and a gorilla were among Clinch's coconut presenters. The annual event became a city-wide topic of interest.
 McCaskey's reportage of the 1981 delivery can be viewed by clicking here. Video was posted recently to the Retro Peoria page on Facebook.
 The presenter that year was the late Rollie Keith, a TV weatherman who at the time was transitioning from what was known as WRAU (now Heart of Illinois ABC) to WMBD.
 Because Keith was with WEEK's competition, McCaskey never referred to him by name. Keith was identified only as a former Creve Coeur weatherman.
 A little awkward, perhaps, but McCaskey appeared to handle the task with aplomb.
 McCaskey eventually left Peoria for other reporting jobs in Tulsa, Okla., and Chicago. Then, he put his law degree to use by becoming an assistant state's attorney in Lee and DeKalb counties.
 That ended in 1991, when McCaskey finally joined the family business. He was the Bears' director of ticket operations for 20 years before he became chairman, in 2011.
 It might be safe to say the Bears' lead-balloon 2019 season drove McCaskey nuts. Or coconuts, perhaps.
 The song heard on the way to work might summarize the need for change among the Monsters of the Midway.

"Oh no!" I cried from the bathroom.      "Honey, what's wrong? Are you okay?" My husband ran into the room, wondering, I'm sure, what kind of tragedy could have transpired with only me, the sink and the toilet in the room.      "I've made a terrible mistake," I said, looking at him forlornly.      "What?" he asked.      "I used my night cream instead of my day cream and it's daytime."      He stared at me blankly.      "What do you think is going to happen?" I asked him.      "I guess your face is going to fall asleep," he replied and left the room.      I knew my husband thought it was ridiculous that one person needed so many creams. I have my day cream and my night cream which is heavier than my day cream because apparently one needs more moisture on their face when they sleep. I have night eye cream and day eye cream for the same reason. These are for the fine lines under my eyes which, apparently, are not moisturized enough by the other creams I just put on my face. I have something called a retinol which I'm told is necessary because I'm in my 50's and the retinol helps speed up the regeneration of my skin cells which must be dying off at the same rate as the aged eggs in my ovaries.      Then I have a neck cream for the delicate neck area which feels suspiciously like the day and night creams I already use. I've been told, though, that the neck creams have different anti-aging and tightening properties, which, it would seem, could easily and less expensively be handled by wearing a turtleneck instead. Then there are the moisturizers with sunscreen built in, the primers with sunscreen built in, and the really expensive, really tiny jar of special cream that smells like seaweed because it's made of seaweed and has extra special firming properties which I have no idea if they work because, honestly, who wants their face to smell like fish.      When I was in college, I was a moisturizer virgin and really had no idea what, if any, lotions or creams I needed to maintain my perfect 20-year-old skin. My roommate routinely slathered Noxema on her face every night which quite possibly smelled worse than the seaweed cream they make today. I haven't seen her in 30 years so I can't tell you if the stuff worked, although I assume that the smell of the Noxema was so offensive it's possible that the odor alone would have caused any aging skin cells she might have had to jump ship.      Naturally, I've tried to cut down on the number of creams I use mainly because they're costly and they take up a lot of room in my medicine chest and, I have to explain this whole thing all over again to the TSA agents every time I travel and they wonder why I have so many creams and lotions for one person who has only one face and is only going away for three-day trip. But when I explain that the lotions have multiple uses and can also be used as bug repellant, motor oil, and hoof and mane cream for horses, I usually sail right through.      Knowing that all of this was pretty ludicrous, I decided it probably made sense to try to pair down all the creams to what was absolutely necessary.      I was about to do this when I realized that the night cream had just kicked in and I had to take a nap because my face had fallen asleep.

When the indoor track and field season ended in February, Northern’s girls team brought the Class 3A state championship trophy back to Calvert County.


  A few months later, the girls squad followed up by winning the program’s first outdoor track and field state championship.


  The Patriots had company of sorts, too, as Huntingtown’s boys team equaled the feat, giving Calvert County a sweep of the 3A state championships.


  Northern’s girls scored 85 points to comfortably claim its state title at Morgan State University in Baltimore. Huntingtown’s fortunes, though, came right down to the wire, as the Hurricanes did not clinch their championship until winning the 1,600-meter relay in the meet’s final event.


  “Really, all of our boys did so well over the two days,” Huntingtown head coach Valerie Harrington said after her boys squad won the first outdoor state title in the program’s history. “We only had one relay winner, but all of the other guys battled for seconds, thirds and fourths and those points all add up. Heading into that last relay, I told Ian [Fokum] I needed him to run his best race and he came through and Ryan [Holloway] did a great job as anchor.”


  The meet-ending win gave the Hurricanes 58 points, three more than runner-up Watkins Mill of Montgomery County.


  “We needed to win that race to have any chance of winning the title,” Harrington said. “If we don’t win it, I think we probably finish third overall. But Ian came back from an injury and ran a great race. I told him before the race I needed him to be at his best and he told me he was. Ryan had to watch last year, but it was worth the wait.”


  On the girls side, Northern’s 85 points was 24 clear of runner-up Mount Hebron of Howard County. As per usual, the Patriots filled up the top end of finishers in the distance races, and also had state-championship efforts from Allie Droneberger in the high jump and Jasmine Holland in the triple jump.


  “This whole day was really bittersweet,” said senior Claudia Dolan, who was part of all of Northern’s cross country, indoor track and field and outdoor track and field state champion teams, after the state outdoor meet in which she was part of the Patriots’ winning 3,200 relay team. “I knew this was my last high school meet, but I wanted to leave everything I had out there and do whatever I could for my team. I could never have dreamed that my senior year would have gone so well. I never imagined winning three state titles in the same year. I could not have asked for a better way for the year to end.”

This year brought extra layers of uncertainty. Excessive rain and snowmelt in April led to prevented and delayed planting. The October snowstorms stalled field work for many farmers across the upper Midwest. The itch to get behind the wheel of the combine brings sleepless nights and weighs heavily on the minds of farmers already anxious about matters beyond their control.


  As a lifelong family farmer, I can relate to the joys and hardships of our vocation. We have a passion to provide for our families. We have a bone-deep determination, passed on from one generation to the next, to keep on keeping on. We have a sense of duty to keep the farm intact for generations yet to come. I started farming when my dad passed away in 1960. I’ve coped with the highs and lows that go hand in glove from one season to the next. The cyclical nature of our profession is an occupational hazard and it can take a toll on mental wellness. We know that prosperity requires sound caretaking of Earth’s natural resources and conservative stewardship of financial resources. Pinching pennies comes second nature because history teaches us that it’s often feast or famine for farmers.


  Right now, the agriculture horizon is a bit cloudy. A five-year decline in farm income, retaliatory tariffs on U.S. ag commodities, stalled trade agreements, disrupted renewable biofuel policies, devastating natural disasters, and shortages of LP gas needed to dry harvested grain add to the growing burdens weighing heavily on the minds of farmers. Mounting pressures to pay the bills, get the crops out and make ends meet can overwhelm mental wellness, even when times are good.


  When bottled up and left unchecked, despair can have deadly consequences.


  According to research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the suicide rate is 45 percent higher in rural America than in urban areas. Farmers have higher rates than the general population. A number of factors may contribute to the rural-urban disparity, including geographic isolation, distance from health care services, stigma associated with obtaining mental health care services, and financial pressures stemming from the downturn in the farm economy.

“I found it very hard to go from a walker to a wheelchair, even though the wheelchair gave me more independence. With a walker, you see, I was limited in how far I could walk as the knee would swell up if overworked. It was a big change to go from being able to stand and walk to going into a chair and being confined. It was a shock.”


  Back in 2014, and now comfortable with life in a chair, O’Halloran went in search of an outlet. Her first preference was wheelchair rugby. This quickly became a non-starter, though, as the majority of teams, at the time, were Dublin-based.


  Wheelchair hurling was suggested to her and upon making contact with Steven Casey, a member of the Munster team, O’Halloran was invited to a training session of theirs at the Delta Sports Dome in Limerick. “To be honest, I was saying to myself, I’ll go down, this will be a tippy-tappy sport and I just can’t do that,” O’Halloran recalls of her initial reluctance towards wheelchair hurling.


  “The evening I went down, the coaches, Dave Fitzgerald and Neilus Sheehy, brought me straight into the circle where the lads were and said, ‘this isn’t something you have ever experienced before, be prepared to be sore in the morning’. I kinda laughed, thinking, ‘yeah right’.


  “We did sprints and other drills, and it was like nothing I’d ever experienced in a sports wheelchair. The skill and the lads’ level of fitness was unreal. The next day, I couldn’t move. That shocked me — which was great.


  “It was full commitment, full force. After my first experience, I was like, this is me, I’m coming back. I haven’t left since. I am into my fifth year with them now.”


  Throughout our conversation, O’Halloran repeatedly stresses that one does not need to be in a wheelchair to be eligible to play wheelchair hurling. A physical disability is the sole requirement.


  “I wasn’t in a position to play sports growing up because I was using a walker. I didn’t realise how restricted I was. It was great that I could walk, but you were limited in other ways. The wheelchair gives you this extra bit of freedom. I drive, have my own place. I can do something as simple as carry my own groceries. I couldn’t do that when using a walker.

Bessie Hughes was an employee at the Hope House for two years and said she wanted to do more for the men and women who were reliant on the Hope House and began to serve hot meals to Hazard’s hungry, through an effort called “Feed the Streets of Hazard.”


  “When the shelter shut down when the whole incident happened, I was pretty devastated, you know a lot of us were,” said Hughes.


  During the summer The Backwudz Vipers, of which Hughes is a member, began serving hot meals to anyone who was hungry.


  “If I can’t give them a place to stay, I can at least make sure they have a hot meal when I can provide it,” Hughes said. “I was doing it by myself in the beginning and every week we had more and more people that came and wanted to help.”


  Another member of the Backwudz Vipers, Dale Hanlon, said that despite the influx of volunteers there more are still needed to meet the needs of the people.


  “I’d like to see more churches get involved, they don’t even have to bring anything, if they would just come and see whats going on,” Hanlon said. “It’s more of a blessing to those that serve, just to know you got to feed someone for a day.”


  Some of the local organization to volunteer for Feed the Streets of Hazard include Art of the Mountains, Kentuck River Area Development District, Eagle Finance and Restoration Fellowship Church

For No. 17 Michigan (9-3, No. 14 CFP), the game is a chance at a 10-win season. For Alabama, it is a chance to end a season that had national title potential on a winning note.


  “We’ve been in the championship game seven out of the previous 10 years before this and we’ve been in the playoffs, I think, eight times,” Saban said. “We’re not. So that’s disappointing to everyone. And I think you can say ‘we had a lot of adversity’ ... but I think we could have done better.


  “The only thing that’s going to fix that is you go about this game and creating a memory for yourself that you’re going to be proud of because you’re going to live with this game for the rest of your life.”


  The game gives Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson a second chance against the Crimson Tide. He was the starter for Mississippi on Sept. 30, 2017, when the Rebels went into Tuscaloosa to face the then-No. 1 team in the country.


  “It didn’t exactly go my way,” Patterson said.


  That’s one way to put it. Alabama won 66-3.


  “Completely different player back then, and I was just happy to get the experience,” Patterson said.


  Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh raves about his quarterback, saying Patterson “can make all the throws.”


  “And his accuracy has just gotten better and better,” Harbaugh said. “His understanding is at a very high level. And then he can run. He can get out of the pocket. He can create plays. He can create space. And he's effective both as a runner and a thrower.”


  Mac Jones will remain the starter for Alabama after he took over when Tua Tagovailoa was lost for the year because of injury. Tagovailoa hasn’t said if he is entering the NFL draft or returning to Alabama for his senior season.


  He’s on the trip with Alabama, and time will tell if the Citrus Bowl will be the end of his college days.


  “He's so positive. He's so upbeat. And that's how he's been throughout his rehab now,” Alabama offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian said of Tagovailoa. “He's in really good spirits. I don't think there's a guy who supports Mac more than Tua. But that's who the guy is. And, you know, wherever his future holds for him, this guy's going to be successful in life. And I think, as coaches, that's all you can ask for.”

GAYLORD LINDAL (December 21, 1931 - December 27, 2019) Unexpectedly at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, at the age of 88 on Friday, December 27, 2019. Born in Santa Monica, California, Gaylord grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Gifted with a brilliant mind, he skipped two grades and began attending the University of California at Los Angeles at the age of sixteen before transferring to the University of Manitoba. In 1951, Gaylord moved to Toronto, Ontario to build his life. With only fifty dollars in his pocket, Gaylord started his company, Viceroy Homes Ltd., which would grow to become one of the great Canadian success stories. Among other accolades, Viceroy Homes Ltd. was honoured as the Canadian Export Awards' first-ever Exporter of the Year, presented by Canada's Minister of International Trade in 1999. We take comfort in knowing that Gaylord lived a truly full life. In his personal life, he was a world traveller; a marathon runner; an adventure seeker; a black belt in karate; a voracious reader; an avid golfer, and one of the earliest members of The Donalda Club; a classic jokester; and the deeply loved patriarch of his family. Gaylord will be dearly missed by his loving wife of 32 years, Sharon, who devoted herself to ensuring that he could spend his final years in the comforts of his beloved home. He will be fondly remembered by his children, Christopher, Dianne, Reigh, Gaylen (David Kelusky) and Donna. "Dad" took immense pride over the course of his life in his ability to provide his children the best educations possible. For that, and for innumerable other kindnesses over the years, his children are deeply grateful. Gaylord is survived by his grandchildren, Jessica, Nicholas, Mitchell and Roberta; and his great-grandchildren Rex, Arabella, and Rachael. He was predeceased by his granddaughter, Jennifer; his parents, Hannes Lindal and Sigrun Helgason; and his siblings Pearl, Violet, and Hannes. In light of his appreciation of the ravine systems surrounding his home, donations to the Toronto Wildlife Centre in lieu of flowers would be sincerely appreciated. A private service for the family will be held, followed by a celebration of life at a later date. Condolences may be forwarded through www.humphreymiles.com. Humphrey Funeral Home A.W.

More than 5 million middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2019, according to data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey published in December. For the sixth year in a row, e-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product among high school and middle school students.


  Studies published in the medical journal JAMA in November found that nearly 60% of high school students who vape use Juul, the market leader, and mint was the most popular flavor among US 10th and 12th graders. An estimated 2.4 million high school and middle school students use flavored e-cigarettes, one of the studies found. Fruit was the most commonly reported flavor category, at 66.1% for high school and 67.7% for middle school, followed by menthol or mint at 57.3% for high school and 31.1% for middle school.


  In a statement on Tuesday, Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the reported Trump administration policy "falls woefully short of the bold action the Administration promised."


  "By leaving menthol flavored e-cigarettes widely available and totally exempting liquid flavored products, this policy will not stop the youth e-cigarette epidemic. It is a capitulation to both Juul and vape shops and gives a green light to the e-cigarette industry to continue to target and addict kids with flavored products," Myers' statement said in part.

California has always been a basket of contradictions, and as we begin a new year and a new decade, they seem destined to become even more confounding.


  As 2019 closed, we learned from the state Department of Finance that California, whose population boomed into the nation’s largest thanks to waves of domestic and international migration, is now barely growing. In the 12 months that ended last July 1, California added just 141,300 residents, half the number of recent years, a quarter of what it was during the 1980s population boom and the lowest-ever recorded rate.


  Migration from other countries has slowed to a trickle, and we lose more people to other states than we gain. Meanwhile, the state’s birthrate is declining and its death rate is increasing.

The tense situation in Baghdad appeared to upset Trump’s vacation routine in Florida, where he is spending the holidays.


  Trump spent just under an hour at his private golf club in West Palm Beach before returning to his Mar-a-Lago resort in nearby Palm Beach. He had spent nearly six hours at his golf club on each of the previous two days. Trump spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and emphasized the need for Iraq to protect Americans and their facilities in the country, said White House spokesman Hogan Gidley.


  Trump is under pressure from some in Congress to take a hard-line approach to Iranian aggression, which the United States says included an unprecedented drone and missile attack on the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry in September. More recently, Iran-backed militias in Iraq have conducted numerous rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces.


  Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and supporter of Trump’s Iran policy, called the embassy breach “yet another reckless escalation” by Iran.


  Tuesday’s attack was carried out by members of the Iran-supported Kataeb Hezbollah militia. Dozens of militiamen and their supporters smashed a main door to the compound and set fire to a reception area, but they did not enter the main buildings.


  Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, blamed Iran for the episode and faulted Trump for his “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran.


  “The results so far have been more threats against international commerce, emboldened and more violent proxy attacks across the Middle East, and now, the death of an American citizen in Iraq,” Menendez said, referring to the rocket attack last week.


  By early evening Tuesday, the mob had retreated from the compound but set up several tents outside for an intended sit-in. Dozens of yellow flags belonging to Iran-backed Shiite militias fluttered atop the reception area and were plastered along the embassy’s concrete wall along with anti-U.S. graffiti.

Daniel Edwards, mental health team leader at the Kona clinic, said the issue of fireworks does occasionally come up for those who are in treatment.


  “They might have a narrative in their head that (the sound of fireworks is) life threatening,” Edwards said. “It can lead to panic attacks, anxiety attacks, nightmares and sometimes flashbacks.


  Edwards said he knows the world is not going to change based on one person’s individual needs. So, he tries to prepare his veterans when these types of holidays come up.


  “If they can’t cope at all with it, try to leave the area completely,” he said. “They can also talk to their neighbors about lighting fireworks at certain times.”


  Edwards also advised those who struggle with fireworks to darken the room they’re in and get ear plugs.


  “Remind themselves that they have this emotional urge — that they’re not in danger,” he said.


  Edwards also encourages veterans to seek help. There is a 24-hour veterans crisis line they can call at 800-273-8255. They can also text 838-255.


  “Cope ahead when possible and express it to those who can be supportive of these (struggles),” Edwards said, adding alcohol can make it more difficult to manage the issues.


  Officials at Hawai‘i Island Humane Society also advise pet owners to keep their animals indoors and provide a safe space for them to hide, such as a crate if they're crate trained.


  Lauren Nickerson, spokeswoman for HIHS, said playing soothing music or using a white noise sound machine can help block out the sounds of fireworks.


  "Prior to fireworks, take your dog for a long walk and provide opportunities for mental enrichment like food puzzles or stuffed Kong toys," Nickerson said. "The goal is to have a relaxed pup who feels safe and secure when the booms start popping."


  HIHS officials also recommend keeping a collar on pets with an identification tag and current contact information.


  "This will help us reunite your pet with you in the event that they get lost and brought to our shelters," Nickerson said.


  Hefty fines and penalties, including imprisonment, can be levied against those who light off illegal fireworks. Fireworks may be legally used with a permit during a limited period including the Fourth of July, New Year’s and Chinese New Year.


  The use of illegal fireworks may be a felony punishable by up to five years of incarceration and fines of up to $2,000 per offense. Parents, guardians and other persons having the custody or control of a minor who knowingly allow the minor to explode any fireworks may be held liable.


  Liability may also extend to a homeowner, renter or person otherwise responsible for real property who knowingly allows an individual to explode any aerial device while on the real property.

"


  A few years ago, my family and I visited the San Antonio Riverwalk between Christmas and New Year's Day. It was decorated with twinkling Christmas lights and glittery trees, and mariachi bands played festive holiday music.  


  We expected the Riverwalk to be crowded. What we didn't expect was the great sea of college football fans. Our visit just happened to fall on the weekend before the Alamo Bowl game. Everywhere, we saw face-painted fans wearing purple and white for Northwestern or yellow and black for the University of Missouri. We couldn't even get tickets for a riverboat ride--they were sold out. Entire college bands floated down the river playing their school's fight songs, followed by boatloads of football players.  


  We figured since we couldn't ride the boats, we'd just enjoy from the sidelines. So when the Northwestern band floated past, followed by the Northwestern football players, we yelled, \"Go Northwestern!\" The players waved and cheered back at us.  


  A few minutes later, when the University of Missouri band and players floated by, guess what we did? My mama didn't raise no fool.  


  We yelled and cheered for the University of Missouri. Our little family was quite possibly the most popular family on the Riverwalk that evening.  


  We didn't have a dog in that fight, so we really didn't care who won. I'm glad we didn't have to choose. While my choice of college football teams doesn't really matter, I make many choices each day that matter a lot.  


  As I think about my new resolutions for my new year, I'm reminded that my goals are pretty meaningless if I don't back them up with choices. Those extra pounds I want to lose? My choice. No one forces me to eat potato chips and chocolate truffles. I make choices about what I eat; therefore, to some extent, I make the choice about what I weigh.  


  What about that next book I want to write? That garage I want cleaned out? Those friendships I want to build? They can become reality if I make the choices, day by day, step by step to achieve my goals. Otherwise, they will remain exactly what they are - lofty dreams. (And yes, a clean garage is a lofty dream for me. Have you seen my garage?)  


  This year, I want to stop talking about my goals and actually achieve some of them. In order to do that, I'll try to make better choices. I know my goals won't be met in one fell swoop, but in small steps. Over time. One small choice after another.

North Koreas leader plans to further develop nuclear programmes and to introduce a new strategic weapon in the near future, state media said on Wednesday, although he signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States. Kim Jong Un presided over a four-day meeting of top Workers Party officials this week amid rising tensions with the United States, which has not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. Washington has dismissed the deadline as artificial.Kim said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self- declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBM, according to a statement on the results of the policy meeting carried by the official KCNA news agency. At times smiling or striking the podium with his hand as he made remarks during the meeting, Kim accused the United States of making gangster-like demands and maintaining a hostile policy, such as by holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.He pledged to continue bolstering his countrys nuclear deterrent but said the scope and depth of that deterrent will be properly co-ordinated depending on the attitude of the United States. The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, Kim said, using the initials for North Koreas official name - the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U.S. and guaranteeing our long-term security. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be deeply disappointing if Kim reneges on denuclearisation commitments and Kim would hopefully choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.In his latest comments on Tuesday in the United States, President Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word. He likes me, I like him. We get along. Hes representing his country, Im representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation, Trump told reporters at his Mar-a- Lago club in Florida. Seouls Unification Ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs said large-scale joint military drills with the United States had been halted and it would be unhelpful for negotiations if North Korea took action to introduce what it called a new strategic weapon.There were no official reports as of early afternoon on Wednesday in South Korea that Kim had delivered an annual New Years address.STRATEGIC WEAPONSKim had previously said he might have to seek a new path if Washington failed to meet his expectations. U.S. military commanders said Pyongyangs actions could include test firing an ICBM alongside nuclear warhead tests. North Korea last test fired an ICBM in 2017. Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said it was difficult to predict North Koreas next move. But it might involve firing a solid-fuel ICBM and an atmospheric nuclear test, he said.However, Jeong Han- beom, who teaches security policy at Korea National Defense University in Seoul, said North Korea would not immediately stage such a provocative act as an ICBM or nuclear test because it could risk derailing negotiations. Tension had been rising ahead of the year-end as North Korea conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with Trump.The nuclear talks have made little headway despite three meetings between Kim and Trump since 2018. Working-level talks in Stockholm in October broke down, with a North Korean chief negotiator accusing U.S. officials of sticking to their old stance. Kim said there will never be denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula if Washington adheres to what he calls its hostile policy.We will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built, Kim said. He called for North Koreans to brace for an arduous and prolonged struggle and foster a self-reliant economy because of a delay in the anticipated lifting of sanctions.The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future, too, and to strengthen the internal power from all aspects. Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the party assembly results made clear Kim wants U.S. security guarantees before taking substantial action toward denuclearisation.And he is suggesting that he will take the bull by the horns to achieve that goal, while promoting self reliance at home and still being open to talks depending on how Trump handles hostile policy, Yang said.

  During his time as a corpsman, Mays said the most serious medical procedures he had to perform were one appendicitis operation and treating two kidney stones.


  “I felt my training gave me a heads up on taking care of the situation when I had to do an operation,” he said. “You don’t operate on a sub unless it’s an absolute emergency.”


  One of Mays claims to fame is his ability to ride a unicycle. Photographs can easily be found online of his riding a unicycle on the hull of the Bergall.


  “I was allowed to bring a unicycle on every submarine I rode,” he said.


  After 20 years of service, Mays decided to leave the Navy, never having earned that pharmacists’ degree.


  “I still had it in my mind even at the end to go back to school,” he said.


  Instead, he decided to teach in public schools for the next 33 years thanks to his military experience.


  “Everything I was involved with in the Navy played some part in my life afterward,” he said. “It was a great experience.”

The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.

Proteas captain Faf du Plessis gave a ringing endorsement of the changes in management in South African cricket after his side won the first Test against England by 107 runs at SuperSport Park on Sunday.


  The win broke a five-Test losing sequence for the Proteas and gave them their first points in the World Test championship.


  “We’ve got the right people in the right jobs at the top of Cricket South Africa,” he said of the appointment of former captain Graeme Smith as director of cricket and Mark Boucher as head coach after a period of upheaval in the local game.


  “Leadership always comes from the top and filters down,” said Du Plessis. “I feel it set the tone for the way that we are playing right now. That’s a start for us as a team. Now you can trust the system a little bit more and just focus on playing cricket.”


  An enthralling Test was still in the balance at lunchtime on the fourth day. After a tense morning when England could score only 50 runs in 25 overs for the loss of overnight batsmen Rory Burns (84) and Joe Denly (31), England were 205 runs short of their target of 376 but had their best batsmen, captain Joe Root and Ben Stokes at the crease.


  Immediately after lunch, with 14 overs to be bowled before the second new ball was due, Root and Stokes upped the tempo, adding 30 runs in five overs. Thirteen of those runs came from one over from left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj but Du Plessis persevered with the spinner.


  It was Maharaj who made the crucial breakthrough, bowling Stokes for 14 when the left-hander tried to play a cut shot against a ball which pitched in a rough area and deflected off his glove onto the stumps.


  “We had a lot of confidence in Kesh,” said Du Plessis. “We kept saying that we had a feeling that in the second innings he was going to get Ben Stokes out. He has got him out a few times and the way that Stokes plays he is going to take the game on. We had a gut feeling that it was going to happen. It was a massive wicket for us.”


  When the new ball was taken seven overs later the end came quickly as Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje blasted out the remaining batsmen. Rabada took 4/103 and Nortje 3/56.


  The game was effectively over when Du Plessis brought Nortje into the attack in place of Vernon Philander, who sent down three largely innocuous overs, and Nortje had Root caught behind for 48 with his second ball.


  Earlier Nortje dismissed Burns, also with the second ball of a spell, to make the first breakthrough of the day.


  ## Tourists lack consistency


  England captain Joe Root said the match was won and lost in the first innings “both with bat and ball.”


  He said South Africa escaped from a shaky 111/5 after being sent in, eventually making 284, largely through man of the match Quinton de Kock’s 95.


  “We could have been slightly more consistent,” he said. “We gave them too many boundary balls. De Kock likes to score quite quickly and that allowed him to play in the manner he likes to bat.”


  That was followed by a poor batting performance which meant a first innings deficit of 103.


  “From that point on we fought very hard to get back into the game and we turned up today with a real that belief we could win the Test match,” said Root.


  “At lunch me and Ben looked at the scenario and it was pretty much the same equation as it was (against Australia) at Headingley not long ago.”


  Root said England needed to lift their game at the start of Test matches.


  “The thing that’s frustrating is that when we are behind the eight ball we show a lot of character, we show a lot of fight and determination and we find ways of getting ourselves back into fixtures. We need to do that at the start of games.”


  Root said he hoped the bout of illness which had affected 14 members of the squad had run its course. “Hopefully we can all be fighting fit and ready to go for Cape Town and bounce back very quickly.”


  The second Test starts at Newlands on Friday.

Those previously mentioned Iowa and New Hampshire jumbles omit Amy Klobuchar. But the Minnesota senator is plugging away in both states. She just hit her 99th Iowa county (that’s all of them), demonstrating her effort to use complex caucus rules that can reward candidates with a wide geographic footprint. Notably, Klobuchar’s strategy tracks Biden. Both aim for a more consistent appeal across 1,679 precincts than Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg muster on Feb. 3. The question becomes how many precincts give both Biden and Klobuchar the minimum 15% support required to count toward delegates. Anyone who doesn’t hit that viability mark drops from subsequent ballots, their backers going up for grabs. Biden’s Iowa hopes depend in part on picking up moderates on realignment votes (read: Klobuchar and Buttigieg supporters). If Klobuchar is as strong as she hopes to be, she could turn that strategy around on Biden, driving him below viability and attracting his supporters on later ballots. Biden returns to Iowa this week for another bus tour, though not as lengthy as his eight-day jaunt after Thanksgiving.

Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite; what we put off will fall by the wayside.

The Leonardtown Raiders were hoping to cap off an undefeated season on Nov. 16 in the Class 4A state boys soccer championship game at Loyola University’s Ridley Athletic Complex in Baltimore, but facing the defending state champions of Walt Whitman was going to be a challenge.


  “Leonardtown is a strong program,” Raiders head coach Robert Hor said after the game. “We have been in, I think, the toughest region year after year. For the last 10 years we have gone up against very tough squads in the region. We felt that if we could break out this year, we were a threat to win it all.”


  The Vikings, of Montgomery County, were able to jump on Leonardtown with two first-half goals and eventually hang on for a 3-1 win to defend their state title.


  For Leonardtown, the loss was the team’s only defeat of the season as the Raiders finished with a 19-1 overall record in 2019.


  “We got off to a slow start,” Hor said. “It is disappointing because all season long we had really started strong and put other teams back on their heels. We didn’t have that happen today.”


  After surrendering no goals in the prior two games leading into the state final, the Raiders found themselves trailing 2-0 at halftime.


  “This group was a tremendous group of young men,” Hor said. “They had each other’s backs from the beginning. When they play as a team, no one can stop them. We just fell a little bit short.”


  Kobe Harris, one of 17 Leonardtown seniors, scored the lone goal for the Raiders in the second half with about nine minutes left in the game.


  “We were able to make history that no other boys team at Leonardtown had done,” Harris said. “I was proud of us.”


  The Raiders came up one win short of their ultimate goal, but the team defeated eight regional champions this season, captured a fourth consecutive Southern Maryland Athletic Conference crown and had 17 different players score a goal.


  “We were very excited because this opportunity had never happened to Leonardtown,” Raiders senior Garrett Bridgwater said. “Us seniors had been dreaming about this since freshman year. Each year we thought we could get here and this year we did. We didn’t end up winning, but we still enjoyed it.”


  Leonardtown got a goal from junior Connor Yager with roughly three minutes left in regulation to edge Severna Park 3-2 and win the 4A East Region title to advance to the 4A state tournament.


  “It is always exciting playing an Anne Arundel County team,” Hor said after that win. “I think we’ve made it to the regional final five times in the last eight years or so, and this is the first time we broke through in the last eight years.”

It's around this time of year that people look back on the past 12 months and make plans for the future. But this New Year's is not just the end of 2019 - it's the end of a decade too, the end of the 2010s.      And I'd like to say good riddance.      My family started the decade as a tiny, new family of three, soon to become four, then later five. But it was not easy.      First, tumors took my husband's hearing away in 2010, and there was surgery after surgery until, finally, a device implanted in his skull now lets him hear. For that, we are thankful.      And in 2011 there was the EF4 tornado that made a nearly 6-mile gash across our town, which included our beloved neighborhood where we still live. I was six months pregnant at the time and I had to climb over giant oak trees to see if our house was still standing. It was.      All of our beautiful, giant oaks had fallen parallel to the house, and we were one of only a handful in our neighborhood without major damage. To this day, I miss the giant trees and all that shade. But I realize that good does come from bad: My kids now play in the neighborhood playground across the street almost daily on a lot that was donated to the neighborhood. A home stood on that lot before the tornado.      The decade was tough for us. There was a health scare for my toddler son, when we thought he might have leukemia in 2014, but he ended up with a platelet disorder instead. There were miscarriages. And then, when I was finally pregnant with our last baby in 2015, I was diagnosed with melanoma. The cancer required surgery and a skin graft while I was 25 weeks pregnant. I was terrified, but thankful that it was caught early. Almost five years later, I'm still here.      This year has quite possibly been the hardest of all the decade, as we were hit with the loss of our beloved dog, my 96-year-old grandmother and my dad all within two months of each other. One thing I loved the most was talking to my dad on long road trips. He'd call late at night, with him on the California time zone, and we'd chat about the kids. Of all the people in my life, he was the one I confided in the most, since he never judged and was the best listener. It's been eight months since he died, and I still have moments where I think, "Oh, I need to call Dad and tell him ... " and then I realize that I can't.      Yes, 2019 has been rough.      But like every year, and every decade, there is good that comes with the bad. I started the decade as a new mom with an infant daughter, and am ending it was a 10-year-old girl who is on the verge of middle school, a young lady who I can see blossoming into her own person, someone who cares so deeply for others. This decade has brought me my son, now 8, who is possibly the sweetest boy I've ever met, and my youngest daughter, who at 4 is a fireball who I can already tell will dominate a boardroom one day. She will give us a run for our money in her teen years.      This decade brought me the births of my children, diaper changes, first steps, first words, first days of kindergarten. It's brought us ballet recitals and soccer games, Legos and Barbies - and so much laughter and joy and even tears than I ever expected as a mother.      No year is going to be perfect. Some years will be worse than others, and 2019 has certainly put our family through the ringer. But like everything, there is good that comes with the bad. And looking back on the hard times that have happened over the last decade, we are so thankful for all the joy. And now, we look forward to the next decade, and all that it may bring.      Here's wishing you and yours a very happy 2020.   Lydia Seabol Avant writes The Mom Stop for The Tuscaloosa News in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Reach her at lydia.seabolavant@tuscaloosanews.com.

Heading into 2020, the two market stories will remain important. After the UK election, I thought Brexit would take a back seat while trade deals were negotiated.


  However, Boris Johnson has re-inserted the threat of a crash-out Brexit if the trade deal deadline is not met — effectively consigning the UK economy to another year of uncertainty.


  The bullying tactic did not work for the October 31 deadline and is unlikely to work this time, and I expect Mr Johnson to bumble along with populist agendas that never get completed, just like President Donald Trump in that regard.


  All this means that the sterling rally and the pick-up in UK asset prices I had anticipated are now unlikely to happen. The no-deal threat may stall investment decisions in the UK and keep the euro against sterling at an artificially high level.


  The big event in the US will be the election. Yes, President Trump is impeached but that is a political issue and not a market mover. Frankly, there is no chance of him being ousted so it will disappear as a stock market story soon.

Imagine if sleeping were to get you thrown in jail. Or sitting and lying down in public. Or camping. Or snoozing in your car.
   
 In cities across the country, that is exactly what is happening to homeless people who engage in these activities. In an effort to clean up their cities and make residents and visitors more comfortable, lawmakers have taken an inhumane approach to homelessness and made all these actions illegal.
   
 So, in addition to having no place to live and not enough to eat, homeless people also end up locked up and saddled with criminal records and legal fines that push them further into an endless cycle of poverty.
   
 Civil liberties advocates have challenged these laws, arguing they violate the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. This month, they were handed a victory from the Supreme Court, which declined to let stand a lower court ruling banning people from sleeping in public when shelters are full.
   
 We hope the high court's decision will make other cities think twice about adopting such laws, which punish people for their predicament.
   
 A study released last week by the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty found the number of cities with such regulations is growing rapidly. In 2019, 83% of 187 cities had at least one law that restricted begging in public. Of these cities, 55% have one or more laws prohibiting sitting or lying down in public, and 51% had at least one law restricting sleeping in public.
   
 Currently, 72% of the cities have at least one law restricting camping in public. There are even laws that prohibit people from sleeping in their cars.
   
 Widespread sleeping and loitering bans are cruel when homeless people have no choice but to sleep outside. If cities don't have enough shelters for the homeless, they can't get mad when people find whatever patch of grass or sidewalk that is available.
   
 Otherwise, where exactly are homeless people supposed to sleep? Should the 2,500 people in the city of Baltimore who may have no place to lay their head from night to night doze in the waters of the Inner Harbor? Or perhaps floating in midair or in a tree? Or maybe they should never sleep at all? We didn't think so.
   
 These laws that criminalize the homeless only mask the problem -- and do nothing to help people. They are more about making an uncomfortable problem invisible to those who don't want to admit it exists.
   
 On top of that, in many cities it just overburdens the jails and courts to have to process people for such trivial indiscretions. Law enforcement resources should be spent on other priorities, such as carjackings, burglaries and solving homicides.
   
 Some city officials have argued that shelters are dangerous and overcrowded. Hopefully, the Supreme Court's decision will force cities into finally increasing their affordable housing stock -- whether it is through tiny house programs or affordable apartment buildings.
   
 Let's put people in real homes and not jail houses.

The significant driving factor behind this development are the rise in the utilization of blood group typing in forensic science, requirement for grouping of the blood in case of pregnancy and prenatal testing; rise in cases of road accidents and injuries that requires blood transfusion, increment in the demand of blood products and blood items, and rise in blood donation. Blood group typing is exceptionally urgent for the recognition of hemolytic disease of the infant (HDN) in pregnant ladies which in the long run empowers the use of blood group typing, thus leading to the development of the global market.

We are in a new moon phase entering the third decade of the 21st century and I'm relieved to see 2019 in my rearview mirror. Perhaps I'm not alone. Now it's time to assess the hurts, disappointments, betrayals and plain bad luck of the past year. Why? Because I'm packing for a new decade and that kind of baggage is not coming with me.      When examining my part in painful episodes, I often say, "Well, I'll never do that again!" Or I think, "To what purpose did all this happen?" Then I pack up those boxes and file them in a dusty corner of "lessons learned." Gosh, there's a lot of stuff there.      I once heard mystic Betty Bethards say troublesome issues will repeat in one's life until that person recognizes the need to change both mindset and actions. Stop being the victim. Envision the future and see what part your current reaction could have on it. If folks bring you down, then change your company.      Back then, I'd go up in a sheet of flame and took things personally when I didn't get my way. I would debate to the death, or at the very least, have the last caustic word.      Wait. Being measured is not the same as being weak?      OK, I'll give it a try (I thought grudgingly).      It's true. Present responses do affect the future in ways I never could have foreseen.      For example, right around that time a colleague did me wrong on a collaborative project and I decided to check my ego. Who cares if she gets all the glory? Neither she nor the project were important in my life, so I said nothing and moved on.      Much later, I opened my own business and she brought me a big client, which proved to be career changing. Out of the blue, she called, "They asked me to handle their business, but I'm too busy, and I thought of you."      If I had told her off three years earlier, that never would have happened. Over the years, self-control is what I practice most and it tries my patience every day. However, the shorter time I have on the planet, the longer view I take, which is to puzzle out random weirdness to find future hope.      Recently, I became friends with a young woman, brainy, kind, beautiful inside and out. Yet she battled depression and self-harm. She wants to become a nurse, but her pain is overwhelming at times. "When will I stop hurting?" she wondered.      I said, "Maybe you're on an accelerated, master's course in suffering. Someday, you can use your insights to heal others. Authenticity is powerful."      "I like that," she said.      Experiences can be put to purpose, and so we pack up reassurance and hope, leaving the rest behind, and we help each other step into a new decade.

Finally, in Huntington, the mayor as well as all 11 city council seats will be up for grabs in 2020.
 With such a multitude of offices up for election in 2020, John Kilwein, the department chair of West Virginia University’s Department of Political Science, said there will likely be high voter turnout.
 “Normally we’re not exactly a voting public. We have relatively low turnout when you compare us with other similar democracies, but I think that the 2020 (election) could be pretty dramatic in terms of the two kind of hard core camps within each party,” said Kilwein, referring to the presidential election.
 He added that presidential elections typically draw more voters to the polls, which also generally means more turnout for the local elections.
 Though voters will have a lot to consider in 2020, Kilwein suggests that voters keep an open mind, gather information from multiple sources and make themselves familiar with what’s taking place in order to make the most informed decisions when casting ballots.
 “Get lots of sleep and buckle your seat belt because it’s going to be a bumpy ride,” he said. “And prepare for what’s going to be a very unusual year.”

PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Wildfires burning across Australia's two most populous states on Tuesday trapped residents of a seaside town in apocalyptic conditions, destroyed many properties and caused at least two fatalities.   About 5 million hectares (12.35 million acres) of land have burned nationwide during the wildfire crisis, with 12 people confirmed dead and more than 1,000 homes destroyed.   The annual Australian fire season, which peaks during the Southern Hemisphere summer, started early after an unusually warm and dry winter. Record-breaking heat and windy conditions triggered wildfires in New South Wales and Queensland states in September.   In the southeastern town of Mallacoota in Victoria state, around 4,000 residents fled toward the waterside as winds pushed an emergency-level wildfire toward their homes. The town was shrouded in darkness from the smoke before turning an unnerving shade of bright red.   Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said there were plans to evacuate the trapped people by sea. There also were grave fears for four people missing. "We can't confirm their whereabouts," Andrews told reporters on Tuesday.   Andrews has requested assistance from 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada.   Victoria Emergency Services Commissioner Andrew Crisp confirmed "significant" property losses across the region.   Fire conditions worsened in Victoria and New South Wales after oppressive heat Monday mixed with strong winds and lightning.   Police in New South Wales said Tuesday that two men, believed to be father and son, died in a house in the wildfire-ravaged southeast town of Cobargo, while there are fears for another man missing.   "They were obviously trying to do their best with the fire as it came through in the early hours of the morning," New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said. "The other person that we are trying to get to, we think that person was trying to defend their property in the early hours of the morning."   On Monday, a firefighter was killed when extreme winds flipped his truck. Samuel McPaul, 28, was the third volunteer firefighter in New South Wales to have died in the past two weeks. He was an expectant father.   The state's Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said a "significant" number of properties had been destroyed.   Some communities canceled New Year's fireworks celebrations, but Sydney's popular display over its iconic harbor front was to go ahead. The city was granted an exemption to a total fireworks ban that is in place there and elsewhere to prevent new wildfires.   Sydney's popular celebrations were expected to attract around a million spectators and generate 130 million Australian dollars ($91 million) for New South Wales' economy.

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - New Year’s Eve festivities are in full swing, and alcohol is at the forefront of many celebrations. With alcohol comes decisions and often times, consequences.A local bartender, Mario Castilleja, expects many more people than normal to come out for New Year’s Eve drinks. He hopes customers choose to be responsible.“Stick to moderation. For me, that’s always been key,” Castilleja said.Making safe choices at the bar is just as important as making safe choices on the way home. Arranging for someone to pick you up or having a designated driver could save your life.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says more than 10,500 people died in alcohol-related crashes in the United States last year.“If you’re pulled over by a state trooper during the holidays, or anytime, and you are under the influence to the point where you are too impaired to operate that vehicle, you will be placed under arrest and have to deal with the consequences that come after that,” said Benjamin Carswell of the Alabama Law Enforcement.Pat Daniel, the owner of Uptown Wine and Spirits, encourages people to purchase their alcohol to bring home in order to avoid unsafe conditions.“Everyone can enjoy their beverages and not worry about having to be a designated driver,” Daniel said. “In addition, it’s a lot less expensive to buy drinks at a liquor store than it is at a restaurant or a bar. So, you can save some money and enjoy your party in your environment without worrying about how you’re getting home.”For those who decide to go out, the general manager of Maltitude has a warning for you.“The biggest thing is do not drive tonight. It is the busiest time of year and there are a lot of crazy people out. Call an Uber, taxi, call your mother, call your dad, whoever. Just be safe tonight guys,” said Daniel Kunze.If you notice a drunk driver, call your local law enforcement agency.Copyright 2019 WTVM. All rights reserved.

Leonardtown High School graduate Jamie Gillan will never forget where he was when he got the news he won the punting job for the Cleveland Browns.


  Making a 53-man roster in the National Football League is enough of a life- changing moment that most players would probably always remember where they were, but for Gillan it was extra special.


  “I walked in [to the Flying Monkey Pub] and everybody saw and kind of knew who I was,” Gillan recalled in a press conference with reporters. “Really nice people, coming up and chatting with me and stuff. I got to meet a lot of the guys there, some of the regulars.”


  Gillan and his father, a navigator with the Royal Air Force who was visiting, decided to go to a local bar about three miles from the Cleveland Browns stadium to watch the Ohio State football game against Florida Atlantic on Aug. 31 with some locals and await the news about Gillan’s fate with the team.


  After sharing a few drinks with people at the bar, Gillan’s phone rang and it was time for the Scotland native’s moment of truth.


  “When I got off the phone, everybody was looking at me like what was that,” Gillan recalled in the press conference. “I just kind of said, ‘It looks like I’m playing Tennessee next week.’ Everybody just started going crazy. It was really cool. It was good fun with them.”


  Gillan made his NFL debut in Cleveland as the Browns punter in a loss versus the Tennessee Titans on Sept. 8.


  “We decided to give [Gillan] the chance to be the full-time punter in our last two preseason games and he basically went out there and won the job,” said Cleveland Browns general manager John Dorsey, a Leonardtown native. “He had to beat out an 11-year veteran punter in Britt Colquitt and we thought Jamie showed us that he earned the job.”


  Gillan was signed by the Cleveland Browns as an undrafted free agent at the conclusion of the NFL Draft on April 27 and has appeared in every game this season at the time of print.


  “I’m very proud of that kid,” Dorsey said. “For a young kid from Leonardtown to being able to come in here and basically win a roster spot is a credit to all the hard work that he put in.”


  The Leonardtown High School graduate played on a full scholarship at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff and broke all of the school’s previous kicking records.


  During Gillan’s days kicking for Leonardtown, assistant coach Brian Woodburn gave him the nickname, “The Scottish Hammer”, which has stuck to this day.


  “I didn’t give him the nickname of the ‘Scottish Hammer’ for nothing,” Woodburn said. “[Gillan] used to look at me and I told him it would stick, and now he wears it like a badge.”


  Gillan punted nearly 60 times in his rookie season with Cleveland with an average of almost 46 yards per punt with the longest being a 71-yarder in a Oct. 7 contest versus San Francisco.


  The Browns finished the season at 6-10 after a 33-23 loss to Cincinnati on Dec. 29.

I happened to be 14 at the time which was great in the sense I was still a child so could enjoy the whole exciting period without having to go to work, but bad with regards alcohol not being on the table though I didn't realise that at the time. Well, mostly, but I'll get to that.


  I mostly remember the days running up to the biggest New Year's Eve of all time rather than anything particularly spectacular on that historic night which, as we all know, turned out to be a bit ordinary after all the end-of- the-world hype. Kind of like most New Year's Eves really.


  I'd had a cracking Christmas getting my hands on a Sega Dreamcast games console, which will always be the all-time leader for present I was most excited about. By New Year's Eve I'd finished every last part of Sonic Adventure though so I didn't spend the whole day simply staring at my 14" portable TV that I'd brought downstairs to stop myself from spending the entire season being anti-social holed up in my bedroom.


  Beyond that, there are little nuggets of memories about New Year's Eve 1999. The music video for Will Smith's Wild Wild West seemed to be on the likes of MTV more than the timelier Will 2K which promised a "Willennium" that hasn't really materialised yet. News programmes were packed with Millennium Bug hype but, by mid-afternoon here in Britain, the lack of disaster in the Far East and Australia where midnight had already arrived allayed any fears we were about to be murdered by our microwaves and enormous desktop PCs.

Robert T. Brown pulled an oyster shell from a pile freshly harvested by a dredger from the Chesapeake Bay and talked enthusiastically about the larvae attached — a sign of a future generation critical to the health of the nation’s largest estuary.


  On an overcast November morning, he culled market-sized oysters and tossed them into a basket. He slid smaller oysters and shells back into the bay, as watermen on several other nearby boats did the same in Southern Maryland.


  “It’s not all doom and gloom like the environmentalists say it is,” Brown, who is president of the Maryland Watermen’s Association, said after catching his 10-bushel-per-day limit. “We have a large number of small oysters that are going back overboard. I’m looking for us to have a good season this year, and we’re looking for a good one next year. As long as we have small oysters, we will have big ones.”


  Not everyone shares Brown’s optimistic assessment of the oyster population. The state’s first-ever formal stock assessment supported claims by environmentalists that oyster numbers have experienced a sharp decline — down 50% since 1999.


  The study estimated market-sized oysters dropped from 600 million in 1999 to about 300 million in the Maryland portion of the bay in 2018. The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science collaborated in the study at the request of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, after the state legislature mandated it.


  Del. Kumar Barve, a Democrat from Montgomery County who sponsored a measure to create a new management process for oysters, said lawmakers are taking action, “because that’s how close we are to the precipice.”


  Oysters play an important role in the bay’s ecosystem because of their water- filtering capabilities. They also create reefs for habitat for other bay life.


  “The oyster is vital to the health of the bay,” Barve said. “Without oysters, the Chesapeake Bay will collapse.”


  Last month, the DNR added two neutral facilitators to a state oyster advisory panel to help bridge the differences between environmentalists, who want to curtail oyster harvesting, and watermen, who fear too many regulations will destroy their livelihoods. At a recent meeting, panelists took turns describing expectations and concerns about a fresh start.


  Memo Diriker, one of the two facilitators named by the DNR, said he believes there is more common ground than people realize, because everyone wants more oysters in the bay.


  “Our job is to start building those bridges,” said Diriker, who is director of the Business Economic and Community Outreach Network at Salisbury University.


  Many panelists said they were tired of prolonged discussions that have ended in stalemates in past years.


  “It hasn’t produced anything monumental, so I’d like to see some change in that direction,” said Jason Ruth, of the Harris Seafood Co., one of the last oyster shucking processing plants left in Maryland.


  Allison Colden, a Maryland fisheries scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the assessment indicated oyster harvesting is happening beyond sustainable levels in more than half of Maryland waters. Colden, who is on the panel, said in an interview that “we all need to come together and figure out how we’re going to keep this moving forward for the future.”


  Gerald Winegrad, a former state senator who led on environmental issues when he was in office, said he believes the wild oyster harvest should be phased out completely over five years, while compensating harvesters to shift to oyster farming.


  DNR chief Jeannie Haddaway-Riccio said the stock assessment provides “the best available science” to move forward. She also says the state’s oyster management plan has been updated, with the goal of creating a sustainable oyster fishery in eight to 10 years.


  The dockside value of the commercial oyster harvest in the bay for Maryland was $8.6 million for the 2017-2018 season, according to the stock assessment, though additional economic value is added through aquaculture, processors and seafood dealers.


  The Maryland General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats, passed measures in the last legislative session relating to oysters. One of them permanently protects five oyster sanctuaries. The other puts new members on the advisory panel and requires the DNR to work with the University of Maryland’s Center for Environmental Science to develop consensus recommendations.


  Republican Gov. Larry Hogan vetoed both measures. Lawmakers overrode his first veto. The other veto could be overridden as soon as January.

ASHEVILLE - A lot can happen in a year, and 2019 felt particularly active.


   


  In the Asheville area, the portfolio of good-to-excellent restaurants seemed to grow at a rapid rate, and not without a few growing pains. As is seemingly always the case, some notable restaurants closed too.


   


  But behind the scenes, things were growing, simmering, ready to change the face of food, drink and agriculture in Western North Carolina in ways that may be imperceptible to some, but still send waves through a big and beloved business sector.


   


  New Belgium and other big brewery sales


   


  In 2019, it was New Belgium Brewing Co.'s almost-final sale to Lion Little World Beverages of Australia that made the biggest waves. News of Bold Rock's sale also attracted a fair amount of attention.


   


  The potential New Belgium sale was announced Nov. 19. Workers at the formerly employee-owned brewery voted on Dec. 17 to move forward with the transaction, making the nearly 30-year-old beer maker, which has locations in Colorado and in Asheville, part of Kirin International Holdings, a Japanese beverage giant.


   


  Bold Rock, the second-largest cider brand in the United States, in November signed a partnership to become part of Charlotte-based beer firm Artisanal Brewing Ventures.


   


  And Craft Brew Alliance, which acquired Boone's Appalachian Mountain Brewery last year, is now slated to be fully owned by A-B InBev, which previously owned only a partial stake in the craft beverage group.


   


  What gives? Local beer expert and author Anne Fitten Glenn said a lot of it comes down to competition.


   


  "There are basically five large breweries in the world that sell more than 50% of the beer in the world, and they started realizing several years ago that craft beer was legitimate competition," she told the Citizen Times.


   


  If you can't beat the competition, buy 'em. Unfortunately, this has the potential effect of driving up prices for consumers, while driving down the selection of real craft brews available through many mainstream retail sources.


   


  Addiction and the restaurant industry


   


  While it's nothing new that the restaurant industry is one where employees often party late into the night, the sheer complexity of the problem is starting to be addressed in what's been a huge step for workers and employers alike.


   


  Self-reported survey data gathered from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration found only miners and construction workers drink harder then restaurant workers.


   


  And about a quarter of restaurant workers reported regularly using illicit drugs including heroin, far and away the highest rate of any major industry.


   


  People with the power to do something are finally acknowledging the issue, whereas over-drinking and drug use was once just shrugged off as part of the pirate ship mentality that pervades professional restaurant kitchens.


   


  To that end, restaurant veterans Mickey Bakst and Steve Palmer in 2016 founded Ben's Friends, a support group for restaurant and bar professionals who want to get clean and stay sober.


   


  On July 23, Asheville hosted the first meeting of its own chapter, with the Asheville Independent Restaurant association leading the charge to start a local arm.


   


  It couldn't come a moment too soon: A recently released DEA database showed 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pain pills were unleashed on the nation from 2006-12.


   


  "Those pills are getting down to our industry in massive amounts," Bakst told the Citizen Times. "We are seeing in Ben's Friends, from people who are coming in, it's not just alcohol anymore; it's opioids. We are seeing people from all walks of life. It doesn't matter race, creed, religion or economics."


   


  Bakst and the others who believe in Ben's Friends hope compassion and a safe space for restaurant workers can help assuage the issue.


   


  Restaurant staffing woes


   


  Restaurants across the country have struggled to keep their staffs intact, and many local restaurant owners and chefs who announced closures this year said recruiting and retaining employees was a factor in their decision to get out of the business.


   


  According to data from the National Restaurant Association, the likely apex of the issue came between September 2018 and January 2019, when the number of job openings in the hospitality industry surpassed the number of hires for the first time on record.


   


  Then, an average of 693,000 employees per month quit their jobs in the hospitality sector during the second quarter of 2019, representing the highest quarterly level on record. The quit rate is on pace to reach its highest level since 2006.


   


  Why the struggle? In Asheville, what's considered the living wage keeps rising along with the cost of living, but not every restaurant pays a living wage. In the fast food industry, where turnover can be as high as an astounding 150%, CNBC reports, the problem is even worse.


   


  A multitude of factors are at play, including the rise of the gig economy and a reluctance to make the food industry into a career.


   


  But the good news is that some restaurant owners are working to change the perception of the restaurant industry as temporary employment, offering perks like 401Ks, dental and health insurance plans and even credits toward non-slip work shoes.


   


  Booming CBD demand led to 900% increase in hemp growing permits


   


  Before the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act swept hemp away in prohibition, American farmers grew hemp for fiber, animal feed and more, with George Washington one of the plant's more famous cultivators.


   


  Now, hemp is legal to grow again and is booming in the state, and the national appetite for hemp and hemp-derived products keeps growing.


   


  Some of hemp's growth is likely influenced by the booming demand for CBD, a non-psychoactive cannabinoid proponents say is useful for everything from arthritic pain to anxiety in humans and in pets.


   


  The Brightfield Group says the hemp-CBD market could hit $20 billion in 2020.


   


  By mid-2019, 3,000 permits had been issued for hemp growers in North Carolina, a 900% increase in less than a year.


   


  But there's some trouble on the horizon. The Federal Drug Administration is cracking down on companies marketing CBD products as dietary supplements or adding CBD to human or animal food and drink.


   


  Meanwhile, state lawmakers are working to ban smokable hemp flower. Also this year, the USDA established its U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program to oversee the production of hemp, which has some growers concerned.


   


  "There is likely to be volatility based on the changing legal landscape for the next three years, at a minimum," the North Carolina State Extension warned growers on its website. "Please keep this in mind when making any decisions about starting or continuing to produce hemp, or investing in other parts of the supply chain."


   


  Big changes to North Carolina liquor laws


   


  On Sept. 1, North Carolina's ABC Regulatory Reform Act kicked into effect, bringing with it changes including the right to sip mixed drinks at distilleries, where customers can now buy unlimited bottles of liquor.


   


  With the new laws, breweries can also now serve beer, wine or cider in dry counties, but only what they make themselves.


   


  In the officially dry town of Old Fort, the changes will become apparent in 2020, when Hillman Beer opens a second location of its Asheville-based brewery.


   


  While beer- and wine-buying customers are already thrilled with the new regulations allowing customers to buy more than one drink at the bar (though some alcohol servers have yet to catch onto this tweak), other regulations are a boon for WNC's ever-growing distillery business.


   


  Now, distillery tasting rooms can sell mixed drinks, which enables customers to try before they buy -- what a concept.


   


  The bill also allows distilleries to serve up to four quarter-ounce samples per person per day at ABC stores where the local board has given the thumbs up.

_The following reports were compiled from the Calvert County Sheriff’s Office, the Maryland State Police Prince Frederick barrack and court records._


  Man charged with trashing house after drinking


  On Dec. 22, Deputy Bradley Boerum responded to Walters Lane in Prince Frederick for the report of damaged property. Upon arrival, Boerum made contact with Maxim Nicholas Bartlett, 21, of Bowie, who was sitting in the driveway of the residence, and, according to the deputy, had a very strong odor of alcohol on his person. Boerum reported that he made contact with a female inside the residence who advised Bartlett got drunk, and then punched and kicked holes in multiple walls and multiple bedrooms. The female advised Boerum that Bartlett also ripped off two bedroom doors and broke them in half and allegedly caused damage to a garage door, requiring it to be replaced.


  According to investigators, the total value of the damaged property is $13,500. Bartlett was arrested and taken to the Calvert County Detention Center, where he was charged with malicious destruction of property valued at over $1,000, disorderly conduct, and intoxicated, public disturbance.


  He was later released on his own recognizance and has a Feb. 20 hearing on the charges in district court.


  Deejay allegedly spins out of control


  On Dec. 22, Deputy Shane Naughton responded to Buckets Sports Bar in Lusby to assist Deputy Timothy Rzepkowski with crowd control. A short time after arriving, Naughton observed Desam Neri Stewart, 49, of California, enter the DJ booth and begin to play loud music on and off multiple times before Rzepkowski advised him to turn the music off and pack up. According to police, Stewart ignored the deputies’ multiple commands to pack up his equipment and was unable to answer questions he was asked.


  Deputies detected a strong odor of alcohol on Stewart’s person and, according to a police report, observed him to be heavily intoxicated. Stewart allegedly began to act disorderly and became argumentative and combative with police. Deputies arrested Stewart and took him to the county detention center, where he was charged with disorderly conduct. Stewart was later released on his own recognizance. A hearing on the charge will be held in district court on Jan. 31.


  Man charged for destruction, drunkenness


  On Dec. 22, Deputy Nicholas Barger responded to Woodland Way in Owings for a reported burglary. The complainant advised that someone was beating on the front door demanding entry. Upon arrival, Barger observed Deputy Thomas Buckler with the suspect, Brandon Angelo Goncalves, 24, of Waldorf, on the front porch of the residence. Upon making contact with Goncalves, deputies reported detecting the strong smell of alcohol on Goncalves. Police reported he became disorderly and was placed in custody. Goncalves was taken to the county detention center, where he was charged with disorderly conduct, intoxicated endangerment, and malicious destruction of property valued at less than $1,000.

  Welcome back. Continuing from last week's column, what kind of person can draw two past Oklahoma governors, George Nigh and Frank Keating to a Christmas party at his house, along with Garth Brook's guitarist Ty England, champion bronc rider Billy Etbauer and a dozen more well-known folks? Well, as I promised to tell you last week, they all came to see a man whose home is now in Yukon, Oklahoma but his story doesn't start in Oklahoma though but rather in a small town called Duvall just outside of Seattle, Oregon. The date was May 14, 1940 and the occasion was the birth of a baby boy but life started out rough. With a father who milked cows for a living and a mother who suffered a crippling nervous breakdown soon after his birth, the boy was raised mostly by his sister who was only four years older. Religion always played a big role in the boy's early years but in 1949 after attending a revival meeting led by Christian crusader Billy Graham his faith became central in his life.


  An athlete in school, the boy exceled in several sports as well as academics, eventually graduating from Pacific University in Seattle in 1962. He went on to the University of Edenborough in Scotland which had the world's foremost seminary. While he was studying there he also worked part-time and traveled through much of Europe, making many new friends whom he is still close to sixty years later.


  After graduation the boy, who was now a young man, moved back home to Duvall where he started working and got married but he had bigger dreams. First of all, he wanted to serve god, then he wanted to help other people and have his own herd of cows. All of this would come to him but not without hard work.


  He got the perfect job to help other people at Acme Personnel and from sun up to way past sundown he worked finding employment for people who needed it. In 1968 Acme offered him a job in Oklahoma which he took. By now Acme was the largest job placement company in the country but financial trouble was brewing for the firm.


  With good credit, a proven work ethic and he would say god's help, the young man bought Acme Personnel and turned it into Express Employment Professionals. It was a big gamble and for several years during the early 1980s it looked like the new company might not make it.


  There was also another problem because this full-grown man could not restrain himself when it came to giving to others. By the 1990s he had his own ranch and as was his way, became particularly interested in helping young people get involved in farming and ranching donating millions in scholarships over the years but he supported many other endeavors as well. From the arts to feeding the hungry, he was willing to chair any worthwhile event or organization that benefited others.


  Meanwhile his stature in the business community continued to grow and along the way he was invited to become a director and then chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City. Yes, the boy who had wanted to help others had achieved all he dreamed of and even today as he has gotten older, he still wants to assist those in need.


  Friends his work in life has not gone unnoticed and last Sunday was a tribute by his friends who came from near and far to wish this man, Yukon, Oklahoma's own Bob Funk, a Merry Christmas. Now you know the rest of this Christmas story and if you want to learn more about Mr. Funk check out the Express Employment Professionals website.


  You can also make a visit to the Copan Cafe and out in the back pasture are some of Bob's prize-winning cattle that cafe owners John and Donna Chaney bought from Bob's Express Ranches.


  Next week a story about a rancher from Bartlesville and how he made his way into the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum.


  Till then have a happy New Year and I'll see ya down the road...

Happy New Year! As we move into 2020, I'm sure a great many puns will ensue regarding vision. I choose to employ restraint in this area.


  Looking back over the holidays we were blessed. My eldest son, Joseph, who lives overseas, was home for two weeks and while such things as Skype and texting help us keep in touch there is nothing that replaces being in the same physical space as your loved ones. It was wonderful being around family over the holidays.


  Joni and I are acutely aware of the vast range of emotions at this time of year. This past Saturday we said goodbye to a former student of mine, a friend of ours who lost a battle with cancer, and on the same day we went to our nieces to meet her new baby girl. It was a poignant reminder that life can be tragic and beautiful, almost in the same breath.


  Sometimes, when you think you see the path forward clearly, life happens and still the show must go on. Just before Christmas our brass quintet (Dave Babbitt and Meighan Lung on trumpet, Chris Mann on Trombone, Joni on French Horn and myself on tuba) was scheduled to play a few concerts. On the day of our gigs Dave was struck with a nasty bug and it was neither possible nor wise for him to perform with us at the three seniors/retirement residences in town. We decided to simplify our repertoire and continue on as a quartet. While we would have preferred to have all five of us playing, we wanted to honour our commitment and make the best of it. In the end we had fun, were able to share our talents and hopefully brighten the days of a few people locally.


  After we finished our gigs, we felt badly for our ailing member so we meandered over to his place and played a few songs in his front yard. The offshoot of the day was that we decided regular playing engagements around town for the quintet would be a great way to push us to improve and share our talents.


  We can plan for the future, prepare for it and even fool ourselves into believing we can control it but in the end, the best we can do is cooperate with what life offers. In Theatre Kent's February show, The Dresser, the actor in one of the main roles had a serious illness and had to step away from the show. He had worked hard for weeks and his loss was a significant blow. However, we have a new actor who will work to get up to speed quickly and in six weeks the play will take the stage. To do a role of this magnitude at a high level takes hundreds of hours to memorize the lines, weeks to investigate who the character speaking those lines actually is so that they are uttered with conviction and an honesty that resonates with the audience and months of rehearsal to bring the disparate group of individual actors together into a company with a single vision. We will do that, because there really isn't an alternative in theatre … to quote my character. "Cancellation's ever so drastic."


  The last look at events over the holidays focuses on our night with The Canadian Brass at the Chatham Capitol Theatre. On Dec. 23 Joni and I, and a large contingent of WCB members, had the incredible opportunity to attend an hour-long demo and discussion with the Canadian Brass, followed by a lovely meal and topped off with a spectacular concert. The world-class musicians were engaging, charismatic and musically impeccable. To see this calibre of musician anywhere is inspiring. To have them in our own back yard is truly a gift. The evening concert, while not sold out, had very good attendance. The only way acts like this can continue to be brought to the area is if they are supported with an audience. The arts can bring life and joy to a community but in the end, they are still a business and to survive they need us to support them in more than thoughts and words.


  So, congratulations on your support of this amazing experience.


  In hindsight I should leave you with a quote for the new decade. "Don't run away from genius, rub shoulders with it."


  - Charles Daellenbach (Canadian Brass tubaist)

6\. HHS’s Wright, SV’s Nester bring attention to Signing DayAll eyes were on the Tri-State area on National Signing Day, Feb. 6, for the Class of 2019 as Huntington High’s Darnell Wright and Spring Valley’s Doug Nester were the top available offensive line prospects left within the class.
 ESPN crews made their way to Huntington High School’s auditorium to find out Wright’s destination, which ended with him choosing Tennessee over West Virginia and others.
 Meanwhile, down the road, Nester was one of the top flips of the class as he switched from being committed to Ohio State to signing with Virginia Tech at Spring Valley.
 Both players took those opportunities and ran with them, living up to their billing as Top-100 overall prospects as they each went on to start during their freshman seasons with their respective universities.
 7\. Cabell Midland, Ironton reach championship gamesCabell Midland and Ironton each made it to their respective state’s pinnacle matchup as each took part in the 2019 state football championships.
 On Dec. 7, the Knights’ season ended at 13-1 overall after they fell to Martinsburg, 49-21. Cabell Midland fell behind 14-0 early before powering back to knot the game, only to see a 35-point surge in a three-minute stretch signal their undoing in the late first half.
 Jakob Caudill finished with 164 yards for the Knights, while J.J. Roberts added 106 yards on 16 carries with all three touchdowns.
 Just hours later, Ironton took the field looking to earn another state title in their storied history.
 But Kirtland was able to hold off the Fighting Tigers in a 17-7 win at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.
 The game featured a defensive feel, and the game’s biggest defensive play came in the final seconds of the first half when Kirtland was able to stop Ironton inside the 1-yard line to take a 10-0 lead into the locker room.

HOW THE SCAM WORKS: The process of stealing the money off gift cards can vary. The scam is most likely to occur at retail locations where the gift cards are left out on racks unattended. With the simplest method, a hacker takes cards off the rack, writes down the gift cards’ numbers, and scratches off the strip on the back of the cards to get the security codes.
 Once he has that information, he puts replacement strips — easily available online — over the codes and exits the store.
 Later, after you buy one of those cards and load money onto it, the hacker gets an alert that tells him that the funds have been loaded onto the card. The crook has used software that periodically checks the card balance via the internet, so the funds disappear soon after being loaded and you are left giving an empty present.
 In addition, BBB has received a report on BBB Scam Tracker about a site that claims to help you check the balance on your gift card, but in reality, the site steals your balance.
 If you need to check a gift card balance, go to the site listed on the back of the card itself or, if there is none, go to the website of the company and look for a link to the gift card page.

But he also reckons getting Griffiths back up to speed over the winter break would be like a new star signing.


  The front man has been restricted to cameo roles this term as he battles back from personal issues and injury problems but he’s been in the first team squad for a month and have a couple of weeks to build his fitness.


  Donnelly said: “There’s a lot of talk about Lenny signing another striker and I am sure he would love to have another option up there.


  “For me, a fully fit Leigh Griffiths would be like a new acquisition for Celtic. He has struggled for fitness this season and they have been reliant on Odsonne Edouard up front.


  “I can see why Lenny would want to bring another one in, and it would make sense.


  “They have been linked with the few and I am sure there are options.


  “But it was be a huge boost if they can use this break to get Griffiths fully up to speed as he could play a big part in the remainder of the season.


  “The squad looks strong when you consider the bench on Sunday and the injured players who still have to come back.


  “They need to use these three weeks wisely.”

In a column about the 90th anniversary of Lenox Square mall in Buckhead, I related an interesting and little-known story about developer Ed Noble.


  He had seen an early map showing a highway coming through the heart of Buckhead. It bordered the estate John K. Ottley, which was for sale. A banker “all but laughed at him” when he applied for a loan to purchase the Peachtree Road parcel, according to an August article in this paper.


  In a display in Lenox marking its six-decade history, there is an image of a plat map showing the Lenox Square Shopping Center. A road dominates the top of the placard, like a winding river cutting through the land. It is marked “Proposed Peachtree Connector.” This was before the construction of the mall started in July 1957. Noble purchased the property in ’56.


  The road would become, eventually, Georgia 400, the planning of which dates back to 1954. Though the part of 400 north of Interstate 285 opened starting in 1971, the southern portion near Lenox Square was not completed until 1993. So Noble was about three and half decades ahead of the curve. It didn’t seem to hurt him, though.

Before we go further, we want to take this opportunity to thank you. Thank you for reading our news and feature stories. Thank you for reading the advertisements, which, along with your subscription rates, pay the salaries that support dozens and dozens of households. Thanks for helping us out by supplying us with comments, letters to the editor, suggestions and tips. Thanks for letting us know when we could be doing something better. Thanks, too, for letting us know what you appreciate about us – we’re often pleasantly surprised by the positive comments we hear and can’t tell you how much those mean to us.


  We believe in what we do, which is journaling the lives of our communities. We have found over our decades of experience that the general readership comes to appreciate that endeavor, too, though sometimes we all forget. Critics have been predicting the demise of newspapers for so long that each new generation since the invention of the radio thinks they’re calling the game on us. Radio didn’t do us in, neither did TV, or the Internet ... oh, we’re much leaner than we’ve been in many decades. But our essential parts are still in good working order.


  We’ve been trimming back, not fading away, and trolls be damned.


  Our business probably includes more facets than most businesses – we gather and write; we edit and put words on pages; we sell and create advertisements; we rely on our business office to keep things in check; we send our electronic pages to a plate-room that provides plates to the press operation, which relies on one of the most wonderful mechanical machines invented; we have a mailroom that puts our products together; we have a circulation department that has been making daily deliveries here about as long as the Postal Service. And we have the electronic side of all that.


  The evolutions that our trade has gone through are amazing.


  Things are going to keep changing. If you don’t like changes, we’re sorry. And if we make changes that don’t work for our customers, we’ll try over again to get it right if it’s possible. The electronic age has been a tough nut to crack for us. But we’ll keep trying. And we’ll succeed.

EDMONTON - The Edmonton Oilers almost allowed what would have been a dubious first in NHL history on Tuesday.


  James Neal had three goals and an assist and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins had a goal and three helpers as the Oilers barely hung on for a 7-5 victory over the New York Rangers after holding a 6-0 lead.


  No team in NHL history has ever come back to win from a 6-0 deficit.


  “We got a little passive in the third,” Nugent-Hopkins said. “They have some high-end skill that will make you pay if you sit back too much, but at the end of the day we got the two points and we’re happy with the win.”


  Leon Draisaitl, Josh Archibald and Kailer Yamamoto also scored for the Oilers (21-17-4) who snapped a two-game losing skid and won for just the third time in their last 11 games.


  It was also the first time the Oilers have won a game on New Years Eve since 1985, going 0-13-3 with a tie during that span.


  “I was one year out of being a rookie in the league, that is a long time ago,” said Oilers head coach Dave Tippett. “I found that stat hard to believe when I heard it, but if that is the case I am glad we were able to break the streak.”


  Chris Kreider, Ryan Strome, Marc Staal, Artemi Panarin and Mika Zibanejad replied for the Rangers (19-16-4) who saw a two-game winning streak come to an end.


  Rangers head coach David Quinn said his team showed some tenacity by not giving up, but they should not have been in the situation in the first place.


  “We showed some things we’re going to need moving forward,” he said. “That being said, we can’t lose sight of the fact we can’t start a game like that and we have to build on that ending and carry that over.”


  After allowing a goal 11 seconds into their loss to Calgary on Friday, the Oilers scored 11 seconds into their game against the Rangers on their first shot, as Zack Kassian made a backhand pass in front to Neal, who directed home his 17th of the season past New York goalie Alexandar Georgiev.


  Edmonton took a two-goal lead on the power play nine minutes into the opening period as Neal tipped in a long Oscar Klefbom shot for his second goal of the game.


  The Oilers kept coming with yet another goal two minutes later as Nugent- Hopkins redirected in his eighth of the season off of an Ethan Bear shot, giving Edmonton three goals on six shots.


  Edmonton went up 4-0 with another power play goal with seven minutes left in the second frame as Nugent-Hopkins kicked the puck back to Draisaitl in traffic in front and he scored his 23rd.


  The Rangers took a bench penalty out of frustration with the officiating and the Oilers scored another power play goal just 12 seconds later as Connor McDavid dropped it back to Neal, who blasted in his hat trick goal.


  Edmonton scored their third goal in less than three minutes as Archibald snapped home his third, chasing an irate Georgiev from the net with Henrik Lundqvist coming in.
