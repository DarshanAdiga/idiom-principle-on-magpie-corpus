PLYMOUTH - Plymouth South Cross-Country Head Coach Meg Slattery said that recent graduate Strickland Davis was some kind of a special athlete during his career with the Panthers. Slattery felt that the production from Davis on the track was not the only thing that made him a driving force within the program.
 "Is he (Davis) going to be missed," Slattery said. "He definitely will be. If I had a meeting after school, Strickland would have everything set as far as far as practice went and he would have it started when I arrived."
 Davis was named Plymouth South's top senior athlete this year and for good reason. Not only was Davis a three-sport, 12-season athlete for cross-country, basketball and outdoor track, but as a senior he was a captain of all three sports.
 He played football until after his freshman year before deciding to get into distance running.
 "I played football for eight years of my life and I started playing travel basketball in the eighth grade," Davis said. "Personally, I competed in 5K races and did well and I felt that it was time to start running."
 "Everyone was getting bigger as they got older, but I enjoyed running a lot. It was fun to do athletics after school."
 Davis began running with the spring track team his freshman year and competed in both the mile and two mile events. His best event of the two was the two mile according to him. He placed in most of the dual meets and running the 5K during cross-country season fit perfectly for him.
 "I enjoy running a lot," said Davis, who led South to the XC league title last fall when he captured the Fisher Division MVP honor. "Drew Mahoney, who ran the two mile before me, and Coach Slattery helped me learn how to pace myself. I keep learning every day. I expect to learn even more when I get to college. Cross Country was perfect for me in running the 5K"
 Basketball was also a good fit for Davis in the winter season. The National Honor Society student played varsity hoop for two years and was a captain as a senior.
 "I ran to help me get ready for basketball, " Davis said. "It was a good twist for me to do something different in the winter."
 This past spring was tough for all athletes with the Coronavirus eliminating the season. Davis had some goals that he had planned to accomplish during the season after breaking the school record as a junior.
 "I was determined that I was going to get under 10 minutes in the two-mile. I trained like we were going to be competing up until the season was cancelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was disappointing to lose the season, but everyone lost a lot when the season was cancelled."
 On and off the race course, Slattery said the Davis was a role model for future Panther tracksters to look to and learn from.
 "Strickland was a captain in both his junior and senior year for me," Slattery said. "He is a great leader and a role model. He is a very talented athlete. He got everyone ready for the each sport."
 "Strickland is committed, he is very determined and he is a hard worker. If you ask him to do something he will get it done. He has the heart and the head to get things done."
 Davis is looking to continue his running career at UMass-Amherst where he will major in Environmental Engineering.
 "I like working with maps and science and that major will allow me to put them both together," Davis said. He is hoping that his future success is mapped out for him.

BOSTON (WFXT/CNN) - Two window washers stranded 13 stories above the ground after the platform they were standing on gave way are thankful for the Boston Fire Deparment for rescuing them.One worker dangled from a rope 13 stories above the ground while his coworker who was also stranded, stayed on the platform they had been working on.Andres Mateo recorded the incident and said he was “shaking.”The fire department could not reach high enough with their ladder truck to rescue the workers. They had to break one window and open another to pull the men into the building and to safety. Hours after the rescue, the workers were back on the job, removing the scaffolding.Their boss Bill Ulchak says he is “grateful for them.”Ulchak explained that an electrical motor malfunctioned while the men were powerwashing the building, sending one end of the platform plummeting.“Everybody was wearing the proper precautions and knew what to do and we were able to get everybody down safely and not get anybody injured,” he said.Capt. Jonathan Hernandez with the Boston Fire Department says the men were not injured and that “they were actually pretty well trained for what they do.” Well-trained workers and skilled rescuers prevented this incident turning into a tragedy. Ulchak says this was the first incident of its kind in 35 years for his company and an investigation is ongoing.Copyright 2020 WFXT via CNN. All rights reserved.

JERUSALEM (AP) — One of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s closest confidants was dispatched to a TV studio to calm the nerves of a jittery nation over an unprecedented new surge in virus cases. Instead, he dismissed expressions of some of the public's economic pain as “BS.” The flippant comment has become symptomatic of what is seen as a bloated and out-of-touch government, and a rallying cry for a series of anti-Netanyahu protests spreading across the country. After imposing strict measures early on and handling the initial outbreak of the coronavirus relatively well, Netanyahu now finds himself shouldering much of the blame for a second round that has hammered both the economy and public health.

There was a time recently, like last summer kind of recently, when every spring and summer weekend in the town of Plymouth was filled with some kind of a road race.
 The same pattern was in place for 2020, but then COVID-19 became a thing and plans had to be changed. This recent  5th Annual Plymouth Fourth of July 5K is an example of how quickly things have changed in this new normal. Instead of traversing around America's Hometown while raising money for the town's 2021 holiday parade and fireworks celebration as well as the family of John Brennan, runners took part in a virtual race on any 3.1 mile race route of their choosing, or even their favorite home treadmill.
 "It's a different reality right now and we are all doing the best that we can to adapt to it," said Anne Marie Winchester, owner of the South Shore Race Management group that helps coordinate many of the road races in the area. "Unfortunately, many of the local charities are losing funds because of the races being either canceled or transitioning to virtual."
 The Fourth of July 5K is one of the races that went virtual for this year. Usually the race can draw as many as 800 runners but this year that number is more like 380 as we get closer to the virtual starting gun going off.
 "We try to run a virtual race the same way we would a regular race. We just did the race bib pick-up at the Marathon Sports in downtown Plymouth the other day," Winchester said. "What we are had people do for this virtual race was allow them to run a 5K distance sometime between Friday, July 3, and Sunday, July 5, and then we asked them to send us their times so we could give out the awards and see who will win with the best time."
 "The running community is made up of honest people so we asked them to send in their times on the honor system" for the virtual races, said Winchester. "It's been a tough time for everyone in the running community. Runners want to be out there competing and challenging themselves against other runners and some great charities are losing out on a lot of important money because of the pandemic."
 South Shore Race Management has helped many groups raise funds for their charitable endeavors, pulling in $230,000 alone in 2019 as well as more than $1.4 million dollars in donations since 2012 according to their website.
 The last "real" road race South Shore Race Management put on was the Shamrock Stampede 5K in Plymouth at the DCR Pilgrim Memorial State Park on March 14. The Coronavirus pandemic exploded across the nation at that point and races like the Moving Heels for Meals on Wheels 5K (Kingston), Gi's Rooster Run (Mashpee), Boston Bulldogs Run for Recovery (Franklin Park) as well as the 10th annual Set the Pace 5K for the Cardiovascular Rehabilitation Center at South Shore Health Systems have become virtual races or canceled outright.
 The five-miler that's part of Carver's popular Old Home Day celebration is the latest race to be canceled. That event was set for July 25 and was called off this week. The Run to End Addiction (Aug. 8 at Bridgewater State) and Duxbury's Half-Marathon (Aug. 29) have both now been switched to virtual events.
 The 3rd Annual Run for the Music (Aug. 30 at Plymouth North High School) is still currently on the schedule as a regular event, and the biggest event coming up is the always popular Boys and Girls Club of Plymouth's Run for the Rock on Saturday, Sept. 12.
 "Road races are in the final phase of Gov. Baker's re-opening plans, so hopefully, if everything goes, we'll be cleared to go by that point. It may be a different race than what we've seen in the past, but we'll do our best to work around any and all concerns," Winchester said. "I think we'll be offering the option of running a virtual race going forward even when live races are allowed again if people are still uncomfortable with running in large groups."
