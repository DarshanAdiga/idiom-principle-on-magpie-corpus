The highly anticipated audio recordings of the secret grand jury proceedings in the Breonna Taylor case were submitted to a Kentucky court and made public Friday following a two-day delay.
 Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who has come under fire for his role as special prosecutor on the case, had requested another week to redact personal information from the recordings before the unusual disclosure of proceedings typically kept secret.
 He turned over the nearly 15 hours of recordings to Jefferson Circuit Court Judge Ann Bailey Smith. CNN is reviewing the audio files of the grand jury sessions, which took place September 21-23.
