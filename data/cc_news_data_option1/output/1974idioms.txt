For Maria Laura Costa do Nascimento, a professor in UNICAMP's School of Medical Sciences and a coauthor of the Frontiers in Microbiology article, while many research projects have been redirected in response to the emergency posed by the pandemic, a systematic protocol must be established as soon as possible to ensure that placental samples are collected in the appropriate manner. Evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to fetus has not yet been found, but reliable studies of its behavior in the placenta are few and far between, she said.

Gov. John Bel Edwards has said the state is initially looking to hire 700 tracers, a goal that state officials expect to meet within six weeks. Call volume, which is hard to predict from the outset, will determine staffing levels as the program moves forward, according to Khalid.
 But even 700 tracers would put the state at only half the number that the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials estimates Louisiana will need, Michaud said.
 Hiring will err on the side of having more tracers than needed, since sudden increases in contacts could occur without warning, Khalid said
 “You’ll never have the perfect amount. We would rather have some that are waiting on workload,” he said.

The new changes in hemp laws are now allowing us to test these claims," adds co-author and hemp grower, Anthony L. Ortiz.

If there's one thing you could do right now; some dream that doesn't seem realistic. A painting. A novel you've been working on. A mixtape. A song. A fucking new quilt. Do it. Stop the worrying; the fear of uncertainty, the possibility of failure. Just fucking do it. Don't let anything stop you. Larry didn't. He wanted to watch wrestling, and holy shit did he watch wrestling. Nothing stopped him. He turned that encyclopedic knowledge into something else. He ushered in a new era for a site that was just two colors. He touched lives daily. He made you feel. You can do the same for someone else. We all have a thirty-minute time limit in this ring called life, and sometimes the X gets thrown up early. Sometimes, it's not all fun and games. Sometimes, the curtain call comes sooner than any of us would like. So go out and have the best fucking match you can with the people that you love.

However, the proportion could increase further if the U.K. strikes a trade deal with the EU or the U.S. Talks between the U.K. and EU have made little progress so far and fears are growing within business circles that there won't be a deal and tariffs will have to be slapped on trade between the two, which would be an additional hefty cost on top of the coronavirus pandemic.

Most popular team sports, from basketball to rugby to American football, have undergone deeply transformative rule changes -- let alone mere cosmetic transformations in how the game is presented -- and audiences have, largely, accepted them. _Not_ in football, and perhaps that's why this weekend was so jarring to some. It's one thing to accept the odd game behind closed doors. Realising that this is the "new normal" for the foreseeable future is a shock to the system.

Who _really_ won the 2018 trade that sent Mack from the Raiders to Chicago, where he inked a record-setting $141 million contract? Mack was _unbelievable_ in his first game with the Bears, recording a sack, a fumble recovery and a 27-yard touchdown return on an interception. Mack went on to post 12.5 sacks while Chicago won the NFC North behind the third-ranked defense in the NFL, apparently getting the immediate edge over the Raiders, who mounted one of the league's worst pass-rushes in '18. Now, though, it's fair to wonder whether the Raiders will be better off in the long run, thanks to the draft capital accumulated and cap space saved, with Mack coming off a relatively mediocre 2019 (8.5 sacks, including just 4.0 over his final 12 games of the year).

The events being cancelled not only effect the athletes who would have competed, but have negative impacts on the economy as well.
 “We usually bring about 180 kids and their families for a week,” Huxtable said. “It is typically around 750 people in these communities for at least three to five days. Some people rent hotels and most rent campers and pay fees to the facility they’re staying on.”
 In light of over half the season and the finals tournaments being cancelled, the top-four participants in each respective event for the fall and winter portions of the season will travel to Nebraska to compete in the national finals, barring any further COVID-19 related complications.
 “We are using the standings from the end of September as well as some of the winter events,” Huxtable said. “Technically, the standings of April 1 is what we will use to determine our top four in each event, with those participants going to the national tournament, as well as the winner of our Queen Contest.”

In the six weeks until then, Baker will be leading the state through early steps of a four-stage plan to reopen the economy. In many cases, darkened day cares and preschools will keep workers frozen on the sidelines. They’ll find it hard if not impossible to restart their jobs — in factories, offices, restaurants and elsewhere — as those who watch their kids await a green light to reopen, as well as the rules they must follow to do so. (New Hampshire allowed day cares to open under new health protocols this week.)
 It’s not just a question of scheduling. Child care providers are in the same economic straits as other businesses, and some will not emerge from the shutdown at all. The Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, last month estimated how many child care slots would be lost without emergency funds from the government. Nearly a third of Massachusetts’ child care supply could evaporate, or spaces for 52,000 babies, toddlers and tots.
