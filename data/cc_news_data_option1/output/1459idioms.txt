Tim Howard said Everton players did not push manager Roberto Martinez out of the club, despite reports of dressing room unrest during the Spaniard's final few months in charge.


  Martinez was sacked during the week after a 3-0 Premier League loss to Sunderland, which meant his side had only won one of their previous 10 fixtures in all competitions


  But Howard described rumours that the Everton squad played a role in Martinez's axing as baseless speculation.


  "That is a grenade that people throw and they duck and watch to see what happens. It's a load of rubbish," said the 37-year-old, who will depart for Colorado Rapids at season's end.


  "There is so much in the head of a footballer. You pull that shirt on, you run out on the pitch and the last thing that crosses your mind is: 'Hey, I've got an idea, I'm just going to strut around here because I am going to get the manager sacked. Let's do that.'


  "I don't know how that works. I don't think anyone thinks like that individually.


  "We don't sit around in the dressing room and have a pow-wow that we are all going to down tools. I don't really know where that comes from."


  But Howard disagreed with Martinez on one thing.


  Martinez always asserted that Everton had not underachieved despite having the strongest squad of his tenure and recording just five home wins in the league this season.


  But Howard said it would be hard to say Everton had not underachieved this term.


  "I think we have underachieved this season. The players have probably let ourselves down," he said.


  "Any time a manager loses his job, they can't replace 22 of us, which is probably unfortunate for them. It is always the manager who ends up suffering.


  "Roberto has not kicked a ball all season. That is down to us. The results have not been good enough for the talent we have and the squad. That is no secret.


  "The foundation is there. The next manager that comes in will be delighted to see some of the faces here at his disposal and to be able to mould that team, play the way he wants to. He will be sitting on a goldmine."

Ottmar Hitzfeld has hailed Julian Weigl as the standout player in the Bundesliga this season after the Borussia Dortmund midfielder was named in Germany's provisional squad for Euro 2016.


  Weigl has established himself as an influential presence in Thomas Tuchel's side since moving to Signal Iduna Park from 1860 Munich last year.


  National team boss Joachim Low included Weigl alongside fellow U21 stars Julian Brandt and Joshua Kimmich, all of whom are yet to be capped at senior level, in his group, and former Bayern Munich coach Hitzfeld has been suitably impressed.


  "For me Julian Weigl is the player of this season – a newcomer – from all the youngsters who made it," he told Omnisport.


  "He played so cool, so convincing. He played like an experienced player during his first season in the Bundesliga.


  "He has very good qualities, is tactically very intelligent, technically good. Someone to play basic passes but also someone who can make the game fast."


  Another youngster selected on the back of a breakthrough campaign is Schalke forward Leroy Sane, who Hitzfeld believes could be a decisive option off the bench for Low.


  "Sane has good qualities, played a great season," he added. "He can do great individual actions.


  "Maybe he can decide games when he comes from the bench because he's extremely dangerous through his individuality."

Jordan Henderson feels Marcus Rashford's debut goal for England can be "the start of something special" as the Manchester United teenager pushes for a berth in the Euro 2016 squad.


  Rashford, 18, netted three minutes into his first start for the senior national team, making him the youngest debutant scorer in England history.


  Wayne Rooney added a second as Australia were beaten 2-1 at the Stadium of Light, but it was the captain's Old Trafford colleague making all the headlines.


  "He's been brilliant for United all season and coming in here, [he had] no fear," Henderson said.


  "Within, I don't know how long it was, but it was early, he gets his first goal for England. Over the moon for him. We all feel that can be the start of something special for him."


  England manager Roy Hodgson now faces a difficult task choosing between Daniel Sturridge, who is battling a minor calf problem, and Rashford as he seeks to reduce his preliminary training squad of 26 to the final travelling party for the tournament in France next month.


  "Everyone's been given the opportunity to go and try and impress and get in the 23," Henderson said of Rashford's chances.


  "[There's] still a game to go, so if he gets some more game time he needs to do the same and then it's up to the manager who he takes."


  Henderson, meanwhile, appears to have won the race to regain his fitness in time for the tournament after suffering a knee injury for Liverpool in April.


  "[It was] my first start in a while but still a lot of things I need to improve on and work on," he said.


  "But the most important thing was getting back out there, getting on the pitch and getting that sharpness back, that feel for first-team football again."

Mats Hummels has described the decision to leave Borussia Dortmund for Bayern Munich as the "most difficult" of his life.


  The Dortmund captain's move to the Allianz Arena was announced on Tuesday, with Hummels agreeing a five-year deal to return to the Bundesliga champions.


  Hummels, who left Bayern for Dortmund in 2009 following a loan spell at Signal Iduna Park, will re-join the Bavarians on July 1.


  The 27-year-old has won two Bundesliga titles and the DFB-Pokal in his time with Dortmund and was part of the team that lost to Bayern in the 2013 Champions League final.


  In a statement published on his Facebook and Twitter accounts, Hummels wrote: After my transfer to Bayern was announced today, I would like to explain it in a little more detail.


  "As you can imagine, the last few weeks have been very unnerving for me because I had to make the most difficult decision in my life. In the end I came to the decision to take on a new challenge for me, moreover, in my hometown, with my family and many friends that live there.


  "I realise that it is difficult for some to understand my decision. But after eight and a half really great years in Dortmund it was time for me to try something new again.


  "With a heavy heart I now leave the team and the club with which I have grown and was able to celebrate great success together with. So I think all who have helped me. To you, the extraordinary fans of this great club, to all employees, the "behind the scenes" people. Of course, even with my three coaches that I experienced here and Michael Zorc and Hans-Joachim Watzke.


  "And stressing even further to my team-mates, because they – despite the fact that these last few years would not have been possible without them – always had an open ear for me.


  "Of course I have seen many messages, comments, and postings hoping to convince me to stay at BVB. And also the great response at our home game against Wolfsburg, whether in the stadium, the training ground or in the supermarket, I was very touched.


  "I speak for the day-one BVB fans and I appreciate it very much."

Atletico Madrid suffered a painful defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League final in 2014, and Diego Godin thinks the experience will assist them in avoiding a repeat on Saturday.


  Godin opened the scoring when the two teams faced off for the trophy in Lisbon two years ago but, after Sergio Ramos' equaliser in second-half stoppage time, Madrid went on to claim a 4-1 win.


  The pair will meet in the final again in Milan on Saturday, and the Uruguayan wants Atletico to use that defeat as inspiration this time around.


  "Scoring in the final felt great, of course – it was a very nice goal – but we didn't lift the trophy at the end, and that was what mattered," Godin told UEFA.


  "We lost, but you have to take the positives from defeats like that and learn where you need to improve.


  "Now we're playing in another final and we'll have to use that experience to make sure it doesn't happen again."


  Atletico's disappointment in continental competition was tempered by the fact they won La Liga in 2013-14, but claiming the European trophy remains a major desire.


  "In the season that followed, it was hard to forget about that final; every player wants to make it to a final and win," Godin continued.


  "But the disappointment was relieved a bit because we'd had such a great season, becoming Spanish league champions – a very important achievement for the club and for us.


  "But of course since that final we've always said that it's still our dream to win that trophy, and we don't hide that – we say that openly because that's what we want.


  "And we will keep on fighting for that. We have stayed true to ourselves for all these years now and if we keep doing that, we have a good chance of things going well.


  "This final is going to be very fiercely contested, and very physical – it will be very tactical, but there'll be a lot of physical effort, too.


  "It would be a dream for me and for the team to win the trophy this time, as well as for all our fans.


  "It's a dream, just like winning a World Cup with my national team, and I'll work towards it until the last day of my career."

For some of my career since I started my own business, I have worked alone in a quiet and cramped apartment or in a cramped office in a larger apartment but with kids running around (both mine and those of my neighbors). I much preferred it with the kids all over the place, even if it was more difficult to concentrate, and the same is holding now with a new baby – well, she is almost 2 – in the house again. But I wouldn’t trade all of that distraction for anything. My kids have all grown up watching their dad work, and often doing their own schoolwork and projects in my office, and I love that. It is another kind of social, as long as the children can respect some of the quiet time that daddy needs to think for a minute. If you ask them, and explain why, they will give it to you. Ditto wives and husbands, or parents, or whoever you have living with you at the moment.

Measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have highlighted the struggles many families are facing. “You need internet to take part in virtual meetings,” says District 3 Supervisor Ray Denison. “Students in DeSoto County deserve to have the capability and technology to learn from home.”


  The availability of high-speed internet service is also key to economic and residential growth. “More builders are creating beautiful neighborhoods in my district with all the amenities. But internet providers aren’t doing the same,” said District 5 Supervisor Michael Lee. “One homeowner told me they are paying more than $500 a month for slow satellite internet. In this day and age that is unacceptable.”


  “We’ve all heard the three most important things about real estate is; Location. Location. Location. That is especially true when it comes to internet access,” says Realtor and District 2 Supervisor Mark Gardner. “A recent survey found home values increase by more than $5,000 if it has access to fiber internet service. I know I couldn’t do my job without the internet.”


  The FCC has launched the Rural Digital Opportunity fund which will direct $20.4 billion to expand broadband in unserved rural areas. The Supervisors will use the survey results to show the FCC that coverage is lacking in DeSoto County and that internet companies need the incentive to provide that service.

Eddie Howe has confirmed AFC Bournemouth rejected a bid from West Ham to sign Callum Wilson and Matt Ritchie, with the manager disappointed by the timing of the offer.


  Bournemouth pair Wilson and Ritchie have emerged as targets for West Ham, who are looking to build on a fine campaign in Slaven Bilic's first season as manager.


  However, Howe has no intention of cashing in on the duo following Tuesday's Premier League season-ending 3-1 defeat at Manchester United.


  "We had a bid yesterday evening. Why it came in the day before our season has finished, I don't know," Howe revealed post-match.


  "It was from West Ham but the bid was rejected and we have no intention to sell. We want to try to improve our squad, not weaken it."


  Wilson and Ritchie played in the rescheduled fixture at Old Trafford, after the match was postponed due to a bomb scare on Sunday.


  The Bournemouth pair were unable to prevent defeat in Manchester as goals from Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford and Ashley Young helped fine-tune United's preparations for the FA Cup final.


  Bournemouth, who ended their debut season in England's top flight in 16th position, did walk away with some sort of consolation after Chris Smalling turned the ball into his own net in the 93rd minute.


  "It's been a difficult couple of days. Not ideal for anyone. It was disappointing overall for us. They dominated possession, we struggled to get a stranglehold on the game," Howe told BBC Sport.


  "United were a level above us in most departments. We didn't make it as difficult for them as we could have done. There's lots for us to ponder over the summer.


  "It's been a fantastic season. We're still in the Premier League - that was the objective.


  "The hard work starts again very quickly. There is work to be done but I don't think we need a major restructuring job."

Roy Hodgson has been tapping into the ideas of England rugby union coach Eddie Jones and hopes the Australian has sprinkled some "magic dust" on his team ahead of Euro 2016.


  Jones became England's first overseas coach when he replaced Stuart Lancaster in the top job following a poor showing at last year's Rugby World Cup.


  The former Japan boss went on to lead England to a first Six Nations Grand Slam since 2003, and Hodgson invited Jones to spend some time at the football team's St George's Park training base on Friday.


  Hodgson hopes that learning about Jones' experience of working with top-class players can come in handy ahead of leading England at the European Championship in France.


  "Basically I was working with him more as a friend. He's someone I've met a couple of times previously," Hodgson said at a news conference.


  "When we've met in the past it's something we'd discussed about coming to see each other, him at St George's and me at Pennyhill Park.


  "Of course I'm rather hoping that some of his magic dust he had at winning a Grand Slam will rub off, that wouldn't be harmful in any way.


  "It's always good as a coach to take some ideas or thoughts or to pick brains of other successful managers in other disciplines. Of course the job, if you like, of managing and coaching elite players has a lot of similarities."


  England play three warm-up friendlies before their opening Euro 2016 contest against Russia in Marseille, the first two of which - against Turkey and Australia - are being played away from Wembley at the Etihad Stadium and the Stadium of Light.


  Hodgson was keen for his players to get an idea of what is involved in terms of travelling at a major tournament, and praised the Football Association for buying into his idea.


  "I'm grateful to the FA for that one. When we came up with these ideas for a new style of preparation going into a tournament that varies from previous ones, it was [playing at different grounds] one of the ideas put forward and mooted," he added.


  "We've got good support in the country and people are wishing us well. So we thought, if we're playing three, would it be possible to take games around the country and show off our skills to some England fans who don't always get chance to see us at Wembley.


  "I'm happy the FA accepted that idea and promoted it."

  Jaehning was born in Morton to Grover and Louise Jaehning. After serving in the military he graduated from St. Cloud Teacher's College and the University of Minnesota, receiving his degree in business administration in 1948.


  He began his career with Seattle First National Bank (Seafirst) as a collections agent. He moved steadily up the ranks at Seafirst eventually starting Seafirst's credit card operations, one of the earliest in the country. His expertise in this field led to him becoming one of the founders of MasterCard started by the Interbank Association.


  Jaehning served as the association's first vice-chairman and became chairman in 1972. He was responsible for acquiring the now instantly recognizable symbol for MasterCard, the interlocking gold and orange circles.


  Jaehning in retirement helped set up banking systems in developing countries. He passed away in 2013.


  Oja graduated from Redwood Falls High School in 1970. He attended the University of Minnesota before transferring to the Minnesota School of Business graduating with an accounting major and business management minor.

AC Milan chief executive Adriano Galliani has denied holding talks with Real Madrid over Karim Benzema, but would not rule out a move for team-mate Mateo Kovacic.


  Benzema's future at the Santiago Bernabeu has been the subject of recent speculation, with new Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho reportedly monitoring his situation with a view to making a bid.


  The revelation from Robert Lewandowski's agent on Friday that the Bayern Munich striker has held talks with Madrid has cast further doubt on Benzema's future, while Milan have also been linked with an offer should a takeover from a Chinese consortium be completed.


  Galliani, however, says Benzema remains highly valued by the Madrid hierarchy and has never been considered a realistic target.


  "We never talked about Benzema with Real Madrid or his entourage," he told Mediaset Premium. "He's very much admired by the coaches, directors and president of Real Madrid, so we never thought of reaching him."      Galliani would not dismiss the idea of a bid for Kovacic, however, with the midfielder having struggled to force his way into Zinedine Zidane's plans since he took charge in January.      "Kovacic? We'll see," Galliani said, before adding: "I am not here to talk about the market."


  Zlatan Ibrahimovic has also been linked with a return to Milan as he weighs up his options following a decision to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract.


  Galliani has repeatedly stressed that the Sweden star's wages would be a major stumbling block for any potential deal and he maintains that meetings with the striker's agent, Mino Raiola, are unlikely to solve the problem.      "I always have meetings with Raiola – we have a good rapport and he represents four or five Milan players," he said. "The problem is not meeting Raiola, but paying Ibrahimovic."

Jordan Henderson is looking to put an injury-ridden season behind him as he sets his sights on Euro 2016 with England.


  The Liverpool midfielder missed large chunks of the season with a fractured metatarsal, an ankle injury and latterly a knee problem.


  Henderson was back in action as a substitute for Liverpool on the final day of the season at West Brom, and he continued his recovery with a 25-minute run-out on Sunday as England defeated Turkey 2-1 in a friendly at the Etihad Stadium.


  Roy Hodgson's side now meet Australia at the Stadium of Light on Friday as they continue their Euro 2016 preparations, and Henderson is hoping to be back to his best soon.


  "It's been a difficult season personally but hopefully, touch wood, I can concentrate on playing football and staying injury free, and playing how I know I can to help the team do well at the tournament," he told reporters.


  "It's been the hardest season of my career so far but you've got to go through that, before that I was quite lucky and didn't really have any bad ones.


  "Hopefully I'm stronger for it hopefully I can stay injury free and get back to my best.


  "I worked very hard with the physios and fitness staff at Liverpool and got back quite quickly, but I need to make sure I'm still managing it and hopefully in a few weeks I'll be in a good place."

Roy Hodgson has called on England to take inspiration from Leicester City's Premier League heroics and claim Euro 2016 glory.


  Hodgson named a provisional 26-man squad for the European Championship on Monday, which included Jamie Vardy and Danny Drinkwater from the ranks of the newly-crowned Premier League champions.


  England are not viewed among the tournament favourites having failed to reach the semi-finals of a major competition since Euro 96 - a feat the Football Association (FA) has publically asked Hodgson to emulate.


  But the 68-year-old believes the youth and talent in his squad can take heart from surprise triumphs at the event from Denmark and Greece in 1992 and 2004, along with an even more stunning success story closer to home.


  Hodgson said: "It's happened in the past, nobody expected Denmark to win it in '92; nobody expected Greece to win the Euros as well; no-one expected Leicester to win the league.


  "Everyone's got to have that hope, everyone's got to have that dream, everyone's got to have that thought in their mind of 'who knows?'


  "If we really play well, do our best and produce the type of football we can produce, which we've shown in quite a few games recently, who knows where that will lead us."


  Hodgson is out of contract following Euro 2016 but would be keen to oversee the next stage of the development for young stars such as Dele Alli, Ross Barkley, John Stones, Raheem Sterling and newly called-up Manchester United teenager Marcus Rashford.


  "The fact is I'm available, I'm ready to carry on, I'm happy to carry on," said the former Fulham and Liverpool boss, who reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2012 shortly after his appointment as Fabio Capello's successor but endured a disappointing group-stage exit at the 2014 World Cup.


  "It would depend on what the FA want, what the general public wants, although that’s harder to judge of course. I shall wait to see.


  "It's not just a desire to keep working with this group of players, it's a really good position to be manager of England. It's a prestigious position and one that brings a lot of pride and honour.


  "Why would anyone, especially at this time when the England squad is on the brink of doing something good, why would anyone want to walk away?


  "But I've been involved in football a long time and I understand it's not always what you want, it's what other people want and it's also about performances and results.


  "The thing we can do, and will do, is work hard during this tournament to give those performances and get those results."

I used to say that Technology News, Hesh’s company, wasn’t a job, it was a way of life. The borders between work and life were porous, and to learn as much as I needed to – and _still need to_ – meant living a kind of hybrid, tightly coupled work/home life. Maybe I am designed to do things this way, maybe I have always been this way, but since Hesh’s business went up on the rocks on Thanksgiving Day in 1996 and he sold me _The Four Hundred_ for $1, cutting me loose so I could find my way as best I could based on the foundation of seven years of my hard work, I have always had two jobs and I have always worked from home, threading my two jobs together along with different aspects of my life. It is hard to keep that job scheduler in balance, and having a huge garden and chickens down here in North Carolina, plus a new baby as well as three teenagers, has not made that balancing act any easier.

Swap lines among the big central banks - the ones that issue reserve currencies like the dollar and the euro - are now routine, but arrangements for emerging economies are ad hoc and unreliable. Regional arrangements haven't worked well even for their members (think of the ESM's difficulties with Greece) and leave non-members unprotected. The distribution of reserves is patchy, with some countries having more than they need and others not enough. Self-insuring that way is also expensive and can contribute to global instability by promoting excessive current-account surpluses and savings gluts; and, when push comes to shove, countries are often reluctant to draw on their putative insurance and run down their reserves, because it signals they're in trouble.

  It's another day on the road.


  You're jamming out to your favorite song with a coffee clutched in one hand and your steering wheel in the other. There isn't a vehicle in sight, which is good. You're driving fast and in a hurry, because you're late to yet another meeting that should have been an e-mail.


  As you're flying down the road you spot a large figure in the distance. When you approach you realize it's a horse with a rider atop its back. There isn't time to slow down. You're already late. You fly past the horse and rider at a high rate of speed.


  You don't look back and keep cruising, but, unbeknownst to you, that horse and rider back there are in big trouble. Being a flight animal, horses instinctively flee from unexpected danger, and your vehicle that came barreling out of no-where looks like a fire breathing dragon. The horse spooks and falls into the ditch, and the rider flies off.


  Both are seriously injured and are stranded on the road.


  What would have happened if you would have taken 30 extra seconds to slow down and give the horse and rider a large berth?


  The horse could have seen you coming, and the rider would have had time to prepare the horse for the vehicle that was about to pass. Would it have been different if it were a bicyclist or jogger - would you have slowed down then?


  Unfortunately, these traffic incidents occur more often than they should. We experience this situation a lot at Redwood Stables - located one mile south of Jackpot Junction. Being a full service horse boarding and training facility we strive to acclimate horses to all walks of life, including becoming accustomed to traffic.


  We ride frequently down the gravel roads and sometimes the shoulder of the highway. It will usually be a toss-up as to whether or not a vehicle will slow down.


  Sometimes people may slow down on their own, but they won't slow down enough, or it requires signaling from us to wave a person down. Unfortunately, people will oftentimes ignore us and keep on driving in a pell mell manner.


  Spooking a horse on the road is just one variable to think about. Another factor to consider is the hazard of kicking up rocks as you drive by.


  If you have ever had a rock hit your windshield you understand how much damage it can cause when kicked up by another vehicle. When passing a horse and rider at a high rate of speed you risk inflicting this sort of damage to them, whether it be their body, face or eyes.


  As horseback riders we want to share the road as much as possible with oncoming vehicles. We ride on the shoulder of the road, so we do not disturb the flow of traffic. Due to various hazards in the ditch, such as holes or broken glass bottles, it is not always safe to ride there to get off the road.


  That is why it is critical to share the road - whether it be for a horse, a jogger, a bicyclist or any other pedestrian. We live in a crazy, non-stop world, and we're trying to keep up with it.


  As a result traffic accidents happen most often when we're in a hurry. We become impulsive and a little reckless. Simply taking a few extra seconds to slow down and drive around horses while encountering them on the road can save lives.


  So please, the next time you see a horse and rider on the road - just say whoa.
