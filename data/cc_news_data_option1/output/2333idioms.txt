Instead of having to rely entirely on widely varying mathematical models and fight an unknown virus in a fog of uncertainty, governments can start to see what has actually worked in different places around the world.

She's a Julie eeked out a narrow win with a very thrilling finish in the Grade 1, $300,000 Ogden Phipps Stakes at Belmont Park on Saturday. Ridden by Ricardo Santana Jr., She's a Julie sat in the fourth position in the early going as Blamed cut out fast fractions of 22.84 for the first quarter-mile and hit the half-mile in 45.98.
 Ollie's Candy and Golden Award tracked in second and third, while She's a Julie just sat back and watched the speedy madness unfold. Blamed drew clear by a length or so but understandably started to tire on the far turn.
 Meanwhile, She's a Julie and Santana was in an all-out drive and launching a three-wide bid from the back of the pack. As Blamed started to backpedal, Ollie's Candy swept to the lead and got clear but She's a Julie and Point of Honor were advancing as a team and eating up the ground.
 The trio battled down to the wire and it came down to a head-bobbing photo finish that revealed She's a Julie had prevailed by a nose. Point of Honor was a neck better than third-place finisher Ollie's Candy and it was another 8-1/4 lengths back to a tired Blamed in fourth.
 Trained by Steve Asmussen, She's a Julie paid $31.40 for a $2 win ticket and covered the 1-1/16 miles in 1:40.27 on a track listed as fast. Santana rode this horse perfectly and has been aboard for Julie's last 14 starts.
 "Everybody put a lot of effort into this filly," he said. "Steve (Asmussen) said he wanted me to go to N.Y. She's doing really well. I worked her and we were really happy with her. Steve knows what he's doing and I always listen to him. Today, she was feeling good. We got a great break. I sat in the spot I wanted. I knew she was going to give it to me and she kicked it in. She gave me a nice kick."
 She's a Julie was saddled by Asmussen's assistant trainer, Toby Sheets, who handles the stable's N.Y. division and he wasn't sure if Julie got there first.
 "I had to watch it one more time to be sure," Sheets said. "It was very close. I said to Ricardo (Santana) before the race that there was a lot of pace in there, and that's how the race unfolded. It was a very patient ride and the pace upfront helped. She ran super."
 She's a Julie was a $160,000 purchase from the 2016 Keeneland Yearling Sale, where she was consigned by Blandford Stud.
 With this win in the Ogden Phipps, Julie increased her earnings to $1,187,880 and owns 7 wins from 19 starts, with two of those wins being of Grade 1 caliber. The Ogden Phipps was also a Breeders' Cup Challange "Win and You're In" race and Julie just earned an all-expense-paid trip to Keeneland for the Breeders' Cup Distaff on November 7.
 As for unlucky runner-up Point of Honor, this was the third time he's run second in a grade 1 stakes event.
 "Sometimes, I think it's easier to lose by 4-lengths than a nose," Point of Honor's trainer George Weaver said. "You start thinking about all the things you could have done differently, but we're all very proud of her. She ran her eyeballs out once again. There was nothing shameful about this loss. She always gives 110 percent."
 It's unclear at this time where and when She's a Julie might show up next but you'd think she'd have to run somewhere and get tightened up a bit before the Breeders' Cup.

Yet there is a danger of thinking that that is all we have to do. We should observe that even the South Koreans have sometimes struggled to keep a lid on the virus. And this week’s renewed outbreak in Beijing shows it can easily return just when you think you’ve got rid of it. If it is true that a lockdown represents a massive failure of policy and the costs of it cannot be repeated, and also true that testing has always provided the key to avoiding such failure, then it is time for the British Government to be much more ambitious in its goals.

Death rates are 12 times higher for coronavirus patients with chronic illnesses than for others who become infected, a new U.S. government report says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Monday highlights the dangers posed by heart disease, diabetes and lung ailments. These are the top three health problems found in COVID-19 patients, the report suggests. The report is based on 1.3 million laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the agency from January 22 through the end of May. Information on health conditions was available for just 22% of the patients. It shows that 32% had heart-related disease, 30% had diabetes and 18% had chronic lung disease, which includes asthma and emphysema. Among patients with a chronic illness, about 20% died compared with almost 2% of those who were otherwise healthy. Virus patients with a chronic condition were also six times more likely to be hospitalized — 46% versus almost 8%. People with chronic disease \"are much more likely to suffer severe effects of COVID-19, but we can’t lose sight of the fact that previously healthy people can also become very ill and even die as well,\" Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health specialist at George Washington University, said in a statement. Race and ethnicity data, available for just under half of patients, show 36% were white, 33% Hispanic, 22% black, 4% Asian and about 1% American Indian. Though the numbers are incomplete, they echo other reports that found minorities have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Overall, 14 % of patients were hospitalized and 5% died based on available data. Among patients aged 80 and up who died, half had a chronic illness. Roughly equal numbers of men and women were infected, but men were...

"There is kind of a misconception there that there are only 16 cases — and I can guarantee you there are not" because the department is finding evidence that some of the cases are of community origin, which means they have been picked up somewhere locally, but where or how is unknown, he said.
 "There are cases in places you go, places that we don't know about, places that are yet to be tested," which could cause more infections, Talken said.
 The city health department has 73 people in quarantine. That means they have been exposed to an active case and must take precautions for the 14-day incubation period of the virus if they have contracted it. The health department checks in with those people each day to determine if any symptoms of infection have developed.
 The Jasper County Health Department currently has 86 cases in isolation, and 349 contacts of those cases that have been exposed are being monitored. Talken said that is a "telling" number.
 "Jasper County, Newton County and McDonald County, they're are all seeing an increase as well," he said. "We're all in this together. What happens there affects us. What happens here affects them. We are one region."
 Hospital admissions for the illness also are increasing, Talken said, and community spread is happening because people are coming together and have gotten lax about taking precautions.
 "Everybody is getting tired of this," he said. "But here is where I need your help. I need everybody to stay the course, do what is right, take care of each other and wear the masks. You go to other places, Kansas City or Northwest Arkansas, and everybody is wearing a mask. It's the norm. Not so much here. We need to change that.
 "It's human behavior that's driving these case counts," Talken said. "So do your part. By taking care of yourself, you are taking care of everybody else."

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California Gov. Gavin Newsom has agreed not to cut funding for child care programs and health insurance for low-income older adults as part of his plan to cover the state's estimated $54.3 billion budget deficit. Newsom's budget proposal had recommended making fewer older adults eligible for Medicaid to save nearly $68 million. He had also proposed 10% cuts to all child care programs that help low-income adults go to work. After negotiations with the state Legislature, Newsom has agreed to drop those cuts. The move was confirmed by a senior Newsom administration official on Monday who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss publicly ongoing negotiations with Legislative leaders. The news comes as state lawmakers are scheduled to approve an operating budget on Monday that rejects most of Newsom's proposed budget cuts. But the budget lawmakers approve likely will not become law. That's because legislative leaders still don't have an agreement with Newsom, who has the power to sign, veto or alter whatever the Legislature sends to him. Lawmakers are passing the budget anyway because the state constitution says if they don't don't pass a spending plan by midnight they won't get paid — part of voter-approved reforms in 2010 that were supposed to prevent the legendary battles in the past that have resulted in lengthy delays of the state's budget. Meanwhile, legislative leaders continue to negotiate with the Newsom administration to reach an agreement on the budget before the start of the new fiscal year on July 1. Newsom's concessions are a sign the budget talks are progressing, but there are still many more issues to resolve before the Legislature can pass an amended budget. “I'm very pleased at the conversations we've been having,” Newsom said during a...

Queers and punks don't want network channel acceptance, corporate sponsorship or police protection. The key principle of punk has always been Do-it- Yourself. Anyone can be a musician or artist. Everything is up for grabs, to be torn apart and redone, preferably with car paint. Venues could be anywhere, from the local club whose owner was amenable to squatted spaces, like storefronts, abandoned factories and beer vats. The Deaf Club, for instance, was a deaf school in San Francisco that let punk bands perform because the noise didn't bother them. Of course, there are always people aware of its marketability, but punk rock has a strange way of constantly changing, remaining ahead of the market or taking it back from the market and reusing it. And there are bands, including The B-52s out of Athens, Ga., that, although they became popular in the mainstream, still retained their queer edge and listenership.

We have never taken pictures of the sun from a closer distance than this,' said Daniel Muller, ESA's Solar Orbiter project scientist.
 'There have been higher resolution close-ups, e.g. taken by the four-metre Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii earlier this year.
 'But from Earth, with the atmosphere between the telescope and the sun, you can only see a small part of the solar spectrum that you can see from space.'
 The test is being carried out to prove that Solar Orbiter's telescopes are ready for future scientific observations.
 Other instruments will also provide an insight into the environment around the spacecraft, such as the magnetic field and the particles making up the solar wind.
 It comes as Solar Orbiter begins its cruise phase, which will last until November 2021.
 After this, it will enter the main science phase, getting as close as 26 million miles to the sun's surface – beyond that of Mercury, the closest planet to orbit the sun.
 'We have a nine-hour download window every day but we are already very far from Earth so the data rate is much lower than it was in the early weeks of the mission when we were still very close to Earth,' Mr Muller continued.
 'In the later phases of the mission, it will occasionally take up to several months to download all the data because Solar Orbiter really is a deep space mission.
 'Unlike near-Earth missions, we can store a lot of data on board and downlink it when we are closer to home again and the data connection is much better.'
 Space Orbiter was constructed by Airbus in Stevenage and blasted off from Nasa's Cape Canaveral site in Florida on February 10.

Marriott, Hilton and other big hotel companies are used to competing on price or perks. Now they are competing on cleanliness.
 From masked clerks at the front desk to shuttered buffets, hotels are making visible changes in the wake of the pandemic. Signs will tout new cleaning regimens: Red Roof Inns promise "RediClean," while Hilton boasts of "CleanStay with Lysol."
 Hotels are still mostly empty; in the United States, occupancy stood at 37% the week ending May 30, down 43% from the same period a year ago, according to STR, a data and consulting firm. But leisure travel is starting to pick up, and hotels see cleaning standards as a way to soothe jittery guests -- and possibly win back business from rivals like home-sharing companies like Airbnb.
 "I think, more than ever, customers are going to be looking for that seal of approval," said Phil Cordell, Hilton's head of global new brand development, who is leading the group developing the company's new cleaning standards.
 Some hotel brands are more stringent than others, says Larry Yu, a professor of hospitality management at George Washington University. He notes that Accor Hotels, a French company, has developed accreditation standards that its hotels must meet in order to reopen.
 But Yu said enhanced cleaning is happening everywhere.
 "Everybody is doing it, because it is now expected by consumers," he said.
 Guests are already seeing differences. David Whitesock, the chief innovation officer for Face It Together, an addiction counseling company, moved from Denver to upstate New York over Memorial Day weekend. He stayed at Marriott hotels in Iowa and Ohio along the way.
 There were some oddities. Police tape separated him from the front desk in Iowa, and the hotel gave him a key card even though he would have preferred to unlock his room door using Marriott's app. Whitesock brought his own food, but noticed prepackaged breakfasts laid out where buffets used to be.
 But he said his rooms looked, felt and smelled cleaner than they used to. All the guests wore masks and respectfully kept their distance, he said.
 "I felt like it was a safe place to be, that they had done the best that they possibly could given the circumstances," Whitesock said. "A lot of it comes down to, do you trust the hotels and the people who you are going to come into contact with there?"
 Despite hotels' precautions, however, visiting them is still risky, said Dr. Albert Ko, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health. Hotels can bring together travelers from states or countries where transmission rates are higher, for example, and many carriers may not be showing symptoms.
 "That's the kind of thing we're worried about in terms of public health," he said. "Those settings can be the cause of outbreaks."
 Hilton and other companies have called in experts to develop new standards. Marriott and IHG -- the parent company of Holiday Inn -- are working with EcoLab, which makes industrial cleaning products. IHG is also getting advice from the Cleveland Clinic. Hilton has partnered with the Mayo Clinic. Hyatt is working with ISSA, a global cleaning industry association.
 Hotels walked through the guest experience and made changes at every touch point. Hilton's hotel shuttles will be disinfected hourly and passengers will have access to wipes. MGM Resorts, which is reopening four Las Vegas hotels on June 4, will ask restaurant guests to view digital menus on their own phones.
 Changes vary by hotel. Guests may find lobby furniture moved further apart or hand sanitizer stations next to elevator keys. Shared coffee stations are gone. DoubleTree still offers warm chocolate chip cookies, but only upon request.
 Inside the rooms, surfaces like TV remotes and light switches will get an extra cleaning. Best Western is getting rid of decorative pillows, pens and other unnecessary items. Red Roof is telling staff to bag up dirty sheets inside its rooms, to limit spread of disease. Once a room is cleaned and disinfected, Hilton will put a sticker on the door so guests know no one has been inside.
 Ko said in addition to disinfecting surfaces, hotels might want to consider moving dining outside, where the risk of transmission is lower, or limiting capacity in tight spaces like elevators. Marriott's plan includes limiting capacity in restaurants and gyms and ensuring people are distanced in elevator lines.
 Cordell said Hilton plans to keep pools and fitness centers open and clean them regularly.
 "Fitness and wellness is so fundamental to the guests getting back in their routine," he said.
 Hotels are experimenting with new technology. Marriott and others are using electrostatic sprayers to spritz lobbies with disinfectant. Many hotel brands are also encouraging guests to access their rooms using their mobile phones. Hilton says 4,800 of its 6,100 hotels have that capability so far. Marriott offers keyless check-in in 3,200 hotels.
 Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky thinks guests will prefer separate homes to hotels filled with people. Airbnb -- which is also working with EcoLab and former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy -- will continue to upgrade its cleaning protocols, he said.
 "Health and cleanliness are going to be one of our biggest focuses," he said.
 But Yu said hotel chains can ensure franchisees are complying through their normal auditing process. That will be a challenge for Airbnb, he said, which has developed its own cleaning standards but may have more trouble ensuring that hosts comply.

Venezuela exigió el sábado la liberación de un empresario con contactos con el gobierno, que fue detenido en Cabo Verde por acusaciones de corrupción presentadas por Estados Unidos. Caracas tachó la detención de acto ilegal de agresión por parte del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump y afirmó que pretende agravar las penurias del país.
 La detención de Alex Saab cuando viajaba el viernes a Irán fue un duro golpe para el gobierno del presidente Nicolás Maduro. Las autoridades estadounidenses creen que el empresario conoce muchos secretos sobre el líder socialista, su familia y asesores cercanos que supuestamente desviaron millones de dólares en contratos del gobierno, mientras muchos pasan hambre en la nación petrolera.
 No estaba claro cómo las autoridades estadounidenses, que llevaban años investigando al empresario colombiano, lograron por fin atraparlo. El Departamento de Justicia declinó hacer comentarios, al igual que la abogada estadounidense de Saab, Maria Dominguez.
 Una persona familiarizada con la situación dijo que Saab, de 48 años, fue detenido en el archipiélago del océano Atlántico, cuando el jet en que viajaba, registrado en San Marino, hizo una escala para repostar cuando viajaba de Caracas a Teherán, donde se cree que negociaba acuerdos para canjear oro venezolano por gasolina iraní. La persona no estaba autorizada para hablar públicamente del asunto y lo hizo bajo condición de anonimato.
 Los datos de seguimiento del vuelo muestran que la aeronave, ya utilizada anteriormente por el empresario, partió el viernes de la capital venezolana.
 Para aumentar el misterio en torno a la operación, un avión privado de Presidential Aviation, un contratista del gobierno estadounidense, esperaba en la nación insular para un vuelo arrendado el domingo de Cabo Verde al aeropuerto privado de Opa Locka, en Miami.
 El gobierno venezolano protestó de forma enérgica por la detención de Saab, indicando que viajaba con un pasaporte venezolano en una “misión humanitaria” para comprar comida y suministros médicos. En un comunicado el sábado por la noche, el gobierno señaló que el aviso de Interpol pidiendo el arresto de Saab no se emitió hasta el día siguiente a su detención, violando las normas internacionales e ignorando su inmunidad diplomática como “agente” de un gobierno soberano.
 Caracas dijo que iniciaría todas las acciones legales y diplomáticas a su alcance para conseguir su liberación. Pero las restricciones impuestas por la pandemia del coronavirus impidieron un intento del embajador más cercano de Maduro, en Senegal, de viajar a Cabo Verde.
 El gobierno de Estados Unidos trata de reactivar su vacilante campaña por derrocar a Maduro e instaurar al líder opositor Juan Guaidó como presidente en Venezuela, y ha dirigido su atención a altos funcionarios y empresarios relacionados con el asediado mandatario. En marzo acusó a Maduro y a más de una docena de personas de delitos de narcoterrorismo, corrupción y otros cargos penales.
 Saab se convirtió en una persona de interés para las autoridades estadounidenses hace unos pocos años, tras conseguir un gran número de contratos con el gobierno de Maduro.
 Fiscales federales en Miami presentaron cargos el año pasado contra Saab y un socio comercial por lavado de dinero en relación con un supuesto plan de sobornos que les habría supuesto más de 350 millones de dólares, desviados de una promoción de viviendas para familias pobres financiadas por el gobierno venezolano, y que nunca se construyó.
 El gobierno del presidente Trump también sancionó a Saab por supuestamente utilizar una red de compañías fantasma por todo el mundo —con presencia en Panamá, Colombia, México, Emiratos Árabes Unidos, Turquía y Hong Kong— para ocultar enormes ganancias de los contratos sin licitación obtenidos a través de sobornos para la compra de alimentos a precios exagerados.
 “Saab se relacionó con los allegados de Maduro para dirigir una red de corrupción a gran escala que ellos utilizaron cruelmente para explotar a la población hambrienta de Venezuela”, declaró el secretario del Tesoro de Estados Unidos, Steven Mnuchin, al anunciar las sanciones. “Utilizaron los alimentos como una forma de control social, para recompensar a sus partidarios políticos y castigar a sus oponentes, mientras se embolsaban cientos de millones de dólares a través de una serie de maniobras fraudulentas”.
 En privado, funcionarios estadounidenses han descrito desde hace tiempo a Saab como el testaferro de Maduro, aunque no aparezca como tal en documentos judiciales.
 Algunos de los contratos de Saab se obtuvieron supuestamente pagando sobornos a Yoswal, Yosser y Walter Flores, los hijos —de una relación anterior— de la primera dama Cilia Flores, según el Departamento del Tesoro de Estados Unidos. Los tres hombres, comúnmente conocidos como “Los Chamos” —argot venezolano para “los niños”— también están siendo investigados por los fiscales en Miami por supuestamente formar parte de un esquema para desviar 1.200 millones de dólares de la compañía petrolera estatal de Venezuela, dijeron a The Associated Press dos personas familiarizadas con la investigación de Estados Unidos.
 La noticia del posible arresto de Saab se conoció el viernes por la noche, pero inicialmente los funcionarios en Estados Unidos y en Colombia, donde nació Saab, fueron poco claros sobre el asunto. Cabo Verde no tiene un tratado de extradición con Estados Unidos y en los funcionarios están frescos los recuerdos de un incidente en 2014, que involucró a otro objetivo de alta prioridad, el antiguo jefe de espías del ya fallecido Hugo Chávez, el general retirado Hugo Carvajal.
 Carvajal fue arrestado en 2014 en la isla caribeña de Aruba, donde había sido nombrado cónsul de Maduro, pero logró evadir una orden de arresto de Estados Unidos por narcotráfico después de una intensa presión diplomática de Caracas. Carvajal permanece en libertad tras haber sido detenido y posteriormente liberado en España.
 Se cree que Saab ha ampliado sus negocios en la vital industria petrolera de Venezuela a medida que crecía la crisis económica de la nación miembro de la OPEP. Irán envió a Venezuela varios buques cisterna de gasolina el mes pasado, que los opositores del gobierno dicen que fueron comprados con oro y por compañías fantasma controladas por Saab.
 La semana pasada, fiscales en Colombia congelaron ocho propiedades supuestamente pertenecientes a Saab, entre ellas una mansión en su ciudad natal de Barranquilla valorada en más de siete millones de dólares, como parte de su propia investigación de lavado de dinero.

On Monday’s Get Up! Smith addressed the discussion surrounding what Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard have said. Irving was among the players on a Friday call that voiced concerns that headlines will start to focus on the games played and not on the fight to defeat systemic racism. Howard agreed with him: “Basketball, or entertainment period, isn’t needed at this moment, and will only be a distraction.” Here’s Smith, who said they sound “foolish.” “Racial oppression has existed (and) it’s going to exist after this summer, it’s going to exist next year, it’s going to exist the year after, a year from now, ten years from now, 20 years from now. Anybody in our society that thinks this thing is going to be completely eradicated is fooling themselves. You’re always going to have to deal with these things, so that is not an excuse not to show up to work to do your job. You can fight the fight while still showing up to work.”

One prominent agent told me that many of his clients don’t support the bubble concept. When I asked which issue led to the most hesitation – social justice, the novel coronavirus, injury fears or being sequestered, the agent replied, “All of the above.” This wasn’t some Hail Mary attempt by Irving to destroy a plan that has been in the works for a long time. The parameters of the NBA’s strategy to execute the bubble are being written daily in pencil, with adjustments made according to the information at hand. The NBPA wants to ensure the safety of its constituents while also limiting the financial losses of one of the more draining campaigns, both economically and emotionally. In voicing his disapproval in the relative infancy of the planning, Irving has given the league and the union time to address the myriad concerns of those asked to execute an unprecedented effort to keep basketball fans engaged.

My mind is a beehive of activity these mornings. On my early morning walks, I look for wild black raspberries that ripen every June along our southern woods. In a nearby row of sweet gum tupelo trees, a red-winged blackbird emits a crack of alarm like a rifle shot, annoyed that I'm about to harvest this noisy bird's breakfast.
   
 Passing a stretch of meadow lush in clover, my thoughts segue to honeybees that pollinate the ingredients that go into every "bee friendly" pint of Giofre honey ice cream made by Nancy and Dominic Giofre near their apiary in Millersburg.
   
 A decade ago, bee colonies were reportedly collapsing and honeybee pollinators disappearing at an alarming rate. Three-fourths of the world's flowering plants and about a third of the world's food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce. It goes without saying that planting bee-friendly gardens filled with native plants that bloom from early spring to fall would be a good thing for bees and the health of our planet.
   
 Honeybees collect pollen and nectar from milkweed and a variety of flowering plants in our wildflower beds, as well as from wild dandelions, clover, goldenrod and the fruit trees in our small orchard. Bees are attracted by scent and color -- in particular to blue, purple, yellow and orange flowering plants rich in nectar and pollen. To help honey production, we plant cosmos, sunflowers, coriander, mint, lavender and coneflowers. At the edge of our shade garden, a ceramic water basin provides a cool drink for birds and squirrels, as well as bees in search of a water source to keep hives healthy and active.
   
 When Barack and Michelle Obama graced the White House, crystal pots of honey from an apiary near the First Lady's vegetable and herb garden were given as gifts to visiting dignitaries. Locally, workshops are available for those interested in becoming backyard beekeepers. Vegetables, fruits and nuts depend on bees for pollination. Bees have been disappearing at an alarming rate, along with thousands of other insects. The cover of the June 2020 National Geographic pictures endangered species of insects and warns, "You'll miss them when they're gone."
   
 Were fireflies to ever disappear, I would miss their summertime nocturnal light shows that have long been a part of my history. One late May while living at Breakfast Creek, our first home in Missouri, I stood in the yard at that hour when twilight fades into darkness. Suddenly, the blinking of tiny bioluminescent lights carried me back to my grandparents' backyard in San Antonio in the early 1950s. To a dreamy time when the flickering glow of fireflies lit up the night. To a time in my childhood when adults sat in the backyard after dinner while my sisters and I dashed around the yard capturing fireflies in peanut butter jars. To a time when I turned a glass jar into a magic lantern.
   
 A decade ago, National Geographic reported dramatic declines in fireflies in Asia, Europe and North America, most likely due to habitat loss and light pollution. Thailand was among places reported to be losing these bioluminescent beetles. According to the 2009 article, "for centuries fireflies blinked with such synchronicity along Thai rivers that locals fished solely by their flashes."
   
 That image transported me to a time in the late 1960s when I was a Peace Corps volunteer teaching at a school near Bangkok. From the back porch of my little house, I could see the burnt orange reflection of each sunset spread across a nearby canal, as intensely brilliant as the saffron colored robes worn by Thai Buddhist monks. In the hour that followed, fireflies lit up the darkness in that quiet world at the edge of Bangkok decades before development forever banished night.
   
 Early this month, June's full moon was a rare Strawberry, or Rose Moon. Following a week of outrage and Black Lives Matter protests spanning the nation and now the world, Kit and I walked out to our open meadow hoping to find the moon overhead. Awaiting its rise, we silently sent up a prayer for real and meaningful change. Tilting our heads back, constellations revealed themselves as they have for travelers throughout the ages. And then an unexpected light show began. The twinkling of fireflies suddenly transformed the meadow around us, as if stars had literally fallen from the sky.
   
 In that moment, the appearance of fireflies connected me to my childhood, my early 20s in Thailand, and long-ago summers at Breakfast Creek. At once, their luminescence lifted my spirits and filled me with hope. Like candles in the wind, the fireflies illuminate a promise too long deferred, one that can no longer be ignored.

It was not, however, the safest for police. Forty-eight law enforcement officers were murdered on the job last year.
 It is high time and positively right for us to question deadly police actions and to demand more accountability from law enforcement. It is also way past time for all people — especially minorities — to demand an end to gratuitous police brutality. Police work for us, and we all should be treated with respect.
 By the same token, protestors must come to grips with some harsh realities. The biggest threat to people of color does not come from police; it comes from criminal elements within their own communities.
 Crime is generally intraracial. White killers overwhelmingly slay other whites, and the same holds true in black societies. FBI statistics from 2018 concluded when a murder victim was black, 88% of the time, the culprit was also black.
 "The truth is, there are some black folk who do bad things. The sad truth is that their victims are most often other black people," professor John Hudgins wrote recently in the Baltimore Sun. Hudgins, an African American professor of sociology at Coppin State University, urges other blacks to look within to help end the violence.
 "We must realize that some black people are a much greater threat to other black people than the Ku Klux Klan or the White Citizens' Councils," he wrote.
 The scab that hid this nation's racial tension has been torn off. We only heal if everyone accepts responsibility for their prejudices, admits their failures and marches forward in calm solidarity to bring this country together. Otherwise, welcome to the new normal.

México, 15 jun (EFE).- Las irregularidades en la compra de medicamentos e insumos médicos durante la pandemia de coronavirus ha llevado a la Organización de las Naciones Unidas a crear en América Latina el Observatorio Regional de Precios de Medicamentos, una herramienta que busca transparencia en la adquisición de fármacos.
 'Las entidades que tienen que comprar medicamentos en estos momentos tienen una enorme presión', manifestó este lunes Fabrizio Feliciani, director para América Latina y el Caribe de la Oficina de las Naciones Unidas de Servicios para Proyectos (UNOPS).
 En una conferencia de prensa virtual, Feliciani presentó la herramienta, la cual dijo permitirá a los compradores públicos identificar los mejores costos de medicamentos en el mercado y urgió a los países de la región a fomentar compras gubernamentales más equitativas y justas.
 El tema de cuánto se paga por la adquisición de los fármacos, dijo, es una prueba más que tienen los Estados, en medio de una situación donde se atraviesa un delicado pasaje para la gobernabilidad por la percepción de corrupción y la desconfianza alta en las relaciones público-privadas que se vive en América Latina.
 'Es ahora donde se tiene que demostrar que efectivamente el sector público puede ser eficaz y eficiente y responder a las necesidades de las poblaciones más necesitadas', aseguró Feliciani.
 COMPRAS MÁS JUSTAS Y EQUITATIVAS
 De acuerdo con la secretaria ejecutiva de la Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (Cepal), Alicia Bárcena, fue el canciller mexicano, Marcelo Ebrard, quien propuso al organismo la creación de dicho observatorio.
 Indicó que en Latinoamérica hay intereses creados en la adquisición de este tipo de productos porque 'no producimos medicamentos ni insumos, sino que los importamos' y eso ha dado pie a casos de corrupción en las compras de las instituciones.
 Bárcena señaló que, en general, en la región previo a la emergencia sanitaria, había malestar social hacia los Gobiernos, 'y una falta de confianza de ciudadanos y eso es un tema de mucho fondo'.
 El objetivo de esta herramienta, explicó Feliciani, es comparar precios entre distintas fuentes y establecer un rango de precios justos, además de que se fomente la transparencia y promover la rendición de cuentas en los 21 países de la región que aportan datos al observatorio.
 Abundó que servirá para visibilizar la manera en la que se ejerce el gasto en medicamentos reactivos al coronavirus y en dónde se está invirtiendo el gasto público para garantizar el abasto de medicinas e insumos médicos.
 Para ello, el observatorio da seguimiento a través de datos abiertos a 286 medicamentos, de los cuales 124 son críticos para afrontar la COVID-19 en toda la región, pudiendo monitorear más de 20.000 transacciones de mercado, a fin de asegurar precios justos.
 Detalló que, debido a la pandemia, los Gobiernos muchas veces se apresuran por adquirir bienes y servicios y construir más infraestructuras para cubrir las necesidades sanitarias, desde la adquisición y entrega de suministros médicos de emergencia hasta la puesta en marcha de clínicas de salud temporales.
 En este contexto, Feliciani aseguró que es necesario que los países recurran a la racionalidad de los precios, donde se observe si realmente se cumplen las condiciones de precio y calidad en la compra de los medicamentos.
 EVITAR CORRUPCIÓN Y FOMENTAR TRANSPARENCIA
 En marzo pasado durante la Cumbre Virtual de Líderes del G-20, el presidente de México, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, planteó que la Organización de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) tomara el control del comercio de medicamentos ante la pandemia del coronavirus.
 Esto con la finalidad de que no se diera un manejo lucrativo y acaparamiento por parte de quienes tienen los recursos económicos para adquirirlos.
 'El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, levantó esa preocupación y generó un mecanismo nuevo de compras públicas por parte de las instituciones del gobierno mexicano', puntualizó Zoé Robledo, director del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), en su turno de palabra.
 Mientras que Víctor Zamora, ministro de Salud de Perú, señaló que la corrupción en el país cobró factura durante la actual crisis sanitaria.
 Además de que el avance rápido de la pandemia obligó a que trabajaran más rápido para ampliar la capacidad de hospitales y dar una mayor atención primaria.
 Indicó que la alianza con la UNOPS ha llevado a ingresar a los mercados de medicamentos e insumos de manera 'más rápida'.
 A su vez, Carlos Contreras, presidente del Instituto Guatemalteco de Seguridad Social (IGSS), resaltó que en aquel país han adoptado un sistema de adquisiciones integral y política de datos abiertos que ha ayudado en las compras.
 'Esto ha implicado ahorros de alrededor de 270 a 300 millones de dólares', manifestó.
 La semana pasada, la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) advirtió que Latinoamérica se había convertido en el foco de la pandemia por coronavirus en el mundo. Hasta el momento se han superado los 1,6 millones de contagios y las 98.000 muertes a causa de la COVID-19. EFE

If I’m Jordan Clarkson or Donovan , I might not want to play, just for the simple fact that I had a good year and I’m looking for a contract extension, so why would I risk getting hurt?

Game on the line, and you need a bucket. Who is that guy, once they get to the NBA and get acclimated, you think will thrive in that situation? NBA scout: I’d go with LaMelo. He’s ballsy. The thing with him, when he sees defenses are blitzing him, he’s going to find the open guy. He’s 6-foot-7, so he’s going to see over the top of defenses. Killian is a good passer, too, but I don’t think he’s LaMelo. Game on the line, long-term, if he becomes what I think he can be, it’s LaMelo. Again, that’s if the shot comes around like I think it will and he grows even more as a facilitator.
