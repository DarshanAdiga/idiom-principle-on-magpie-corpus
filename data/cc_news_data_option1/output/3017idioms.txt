BROCKTON -- Through the years, Gerry's Farm has cemented its place as a Brockton landmark, providing fresh produce and flowers for city and surrounding residents as one of the last working farms in the city.
 But this year is one to remember, as the farm celebrated 100 years in business with special recognition from the city.

 Not much has changed at Gerry's Farm over the years, which is how they like it, said Chris Gerry, one member of the Gerry family who helps to run the farm.
 They're located in the same wooden, rustic farm stand they've been in since the Blizzard of '78 knocked down their original lean-to structure in front of the house, Gerry said. Throughout the stand, fresh produce is displayed in bins, including potatoes, squash, tomatoes, onions, parsley, scallions, collard greens, kale, cucumber, squash, beans, corn, plums, lemons and limes. On Thursday, Gerry was busy helping to package up fresh blueberries.
 "We try to keep it as homey, like a haven from the past for people," Gerry said. "A lot of people say they appreciate it."
 And it's the atmosphere of the family run business that has kept people coming back, Gerry said, even continuing to return years later when younger customers that came with their families grow up and start families of their own.
 "There are just as many generations that come here as we are (working)," he said. "People appreciate us and we appreciate them more than anything."
 Other than new measures taken in response to the coronavirus -- such as keeping all the doors and windows open, requiring face masks and having staff wear gloves -- it's "business as usual," Gerry said. It's been busier than usual, he said, which he thinks is because customers feel more comfortable stopping by their stand for fresh produce than going into more crowded grocery stores.
 Gerry is the third generation to help run the farm. His father, Joseph Gerry, was the second generation owner of the farm, taking it over from his parents, Joseph and Stephania Gerry, who founded the farm in 1920. A framed picture of the two, faded with time, hangs proudly on the wall at the front of the business.
 And on Thursday, Joseph Gerry, now 95, made his way around the farm with the assistance of his cane. He was on hand in anticipation a special visit from Mayor Robert Sullivan to receive a citation from the city to honor their 100 years in business.
 "It truly is a wonderful accomplishment," Sullivan said. "As a Brocktonian, I used to come here as a little kid."
 As he greeted the mayor and received the citation, he immediately tried to pass it off to Chris Gerry, quipping, 'You're the guy that did all the work.' In turn, Chris Gerry handed it off to his nephew, Greg Gerry, continuing the passage to the "next generation."
 The simple act of passing off the citation is much like how the farm has been run. Greg Gerry, 29, seems next in line to take over operations once his father, Carl Gerry, and Chris Gerry are ready to pass it on.
 "Got to keep it going for another 100 years," Greg Gerry joked.
 He's been working at the farm for the last decade or so, putting in roughly 10- to 12-hour days in the busier season starting when the sun rises. His father mainly tends to the field and Chris Gerry runs the farm stand and greenhouses on the property, while Greg Gerry said he takes care of a little bit of everything to get fresh fruit and vegetables ready for customers.
 "Picked this morning, out for sale by 10 a.m.," Greg Gerry said. "It doesn't get any better than this."
 And much like the unchanging atmosphere of the farm, the staff stays for years as well. Even at 95 years old, Joseph Gerry is still working on the farm.
 "He's been here for most of it, which you don't see often," Greg Gerry said.
 And just as current workers tend to come to work, and find themselves staying and aging with the farm, there are always more young people that join the operation, like Greg Gerry did, to continue the farm's work serving the community.
 "There always seems to be a generation of kids that shows up at our doorstep and become an extended family," Chris Gerry said.

BROCKTON -- For most, being stuck in quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic does not normally spark the idea to open a new restaurant.
 But when Rudy Alves was forced to shutter his T-shirt business because of the hit from the virus, he turned to cooking meals at home to sell in order to make money for his family. Since then, that effort has blossomed into him seeking out a brick and mortar location, to be called Khalil's Kitchen, to serve up comfort food with a Caribbean twist.
 "I've always had a passion for cooking," he said. "After the coronavirus, I was kind of jobless. I just started to cook for some friends at home. One thing led to another."

 The operation grew into a "mini kitchen" out of his home, he said, but due to health and business regulations, he had to go through the proper channels to continue his business.
 Several months later, Khalil's Kitchen is on its way to opening at its 880 Main St. location at the site of the former Arizona Fried Chicken. If all goes well with inspections, Alves said he plans to open around Aug. 27.
 Given the amount of Cape Verdean restaurants in the city, and being from Cape Verde himself, Alves said he's looking to do things a little differently to attract foodies. With that, his food offers a mix of comfort food from the south with a Caribbean tropical flavor -- "soul food with a twist," he said, such as adding jerk shrimp to loaded fries.
 "So basically, kind of mixing two good dishes together and giving people something that makes their taste buds water up as opposed to everyone knows the basic fried chicken, the basic casserole, mac and cheese, things like that, so we just kind of add the Caribbean taste to it," he said.
 And through menu items advertised on the business' Instagram page, where Alves said he's primarily focused social media marketing efforts until he launches the official business website, items have included lobster tacos, a Cajun fried cod sandwich, red velvet chicken and waffles, sweet chili chicken pizza with steak and shrimp, a plantain burger and a pineapple bowl with lobster tails, shrimp, rice and pinto beans inside of a hollowed-out pineapple husk.
 Instead of having one set menu, the menu will change weekly, he said, including introducing different specials every week along with some menu staples.
 "We're just going to try to get people to try different flavors instead of just having a standard menu," he said. "You'll always find something different."
 The restaurant is named after his son, 2-year-old Khalil, as he's "always in the kitchen," Alves said.
 "I said one day I would open up a restaurant and name it after him," Alves said. "It was kind of a joke. He just does little weird things in the kitchen so I said, 'OK, this is your kitchen.'"
 Despite the hit that other restaurants have taken recently, with some permanently shuttering their doors from the loss in business, Alves said he isn't daunted by the prospect of opening his restaurant in the midst of a pandemic.
 "I'm trying to go against it because I feel like a lot of these restaurants that are closing down, the number one thing they're not doing is they're not channeling into their network," he said. "I have a strong following on social media, I network with people everywhere I go, so I feel like it's going to work, even though the virus is slowing things down. … It's a fight to keep going."
 While the website is still underway, with a grand opening to be announced at a later date, hours will be late-morning to evening for brunch, lunch and dinner offerings. And already, Alves said he's enjoying the work, driven by his kids who help out and seeing the reactions from people who have tried his food thus far.
 "Every day, I wake up, it's kind of like, 'Wow, this is really happening,' but at the same time, I'm still happy that I actually took this route because not only do I like seeing people happy, but it also makes me happy because I enjoy doing it," he said. "It's not just something I'm doing to get a paycheck."

 The fact that the 2020 season was going to be a radically different one for the Patriots has been known since last March.
 That is when Tom Brady, who led the way to six Super Bowl championships since becoming the starting quarterback in 2001, ended his stay in New England to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
 The end of a glorious era was at hand with one of the top players in NFL history deciding not to finish his playing days with the Patriots.
 Things were definitely not going to be the same around Gillette Stadium without Brady in the spotlight running the offense.
 But as it turns out, there have been other factors that have transformed the upcoming season in one like no other all across the NFL.
 The COVID-19 pandemic has already altered the way teams prepare for the season, forcing the cancellation of all offseason team activities and leaving players behind with the season opener less than 45 days away.
 Training camp won't be the same and the four preseason games used to get players ready and evaluate newcomers are not going to happen.
 There is even uncertainty over whether the full 16-game season will get played depending on COVID-19. Some teams have already said there will be no fans in the stands while the Patriots are planning to allow about 20 percent of capacity into the stadium on game day.
 The Patriots players began getting tested for the coronavirus last Tuesday and are reporting to Gillette Stadium this weekend.
 That is when the strength and conditioning portion of training camp gets underway, lasting until Aug. 11. The first practice will be without pads on Aug. 12 and the first contact drills are scheduled for Aug. 17.
 Everything is being pushed back because teams were unable to have mini-camps or organized team activities during the offseason.
 The Patriots, who had a rough ending to the 2019 season, lost more than just Brady in the free-agent market, and they also learned last week that six players, including three key starters, have opted out of playing in 2020 because of the pandemic.
 The Patriots won the AFC East 17 of 19 years since Brady became the starter, including the last 11 in a row.
 But the '19 season had a bumpy finish with the Patriots losing the regular- season finale to the Miami Dolphins, costing them a bye in the playoffs. Then, they were knocked out of the postseason right away at home by the Tennessee Titans, 20-13, for their fourth loss in six games.
 There will be some regrouping going on, especially at quarterback where Cam Newton, a former most valuable player, was signed after cutting ties with the Carolina Panthers.
 He is likely to be the starter ahead of second-year player Jarrett Stidham, but Newton will be learning a system on the fly.
 The defense has taken a hit with linebackers Dont'a Hightower (who opted out because of COVID-19), Kyle Van Noy and Elandon Roberts (both signed with the Miami Dolphins) and Jamie Collins (signed with the Detroit Lions) will have to be replaced.
 Safety Patrick Chung won't be playing after opting out, tackle Danny Shelton signed with the Lions and safety Duron Harmon was dealt to Detroit.
 On offense, four starters in the playoff loss to the Titans are not back, including Brady, wide receiver Philip Dorsett (signed with the Seattle Seahawks), offensive lineman Ted Karras (signed with the Dolphins) and tackle Marcus Cannon (opted out because of COVID-19).
 Usually at this time of summer, the Patriots have just a few questions that needed answering. That is not the case in 2020 with a series of question marks floating over Route 1.
 Belichick, whose first press conference was scheduled to be held remotely on Friday afternoon, has plenty of holes to fill on a team that stumbled at the end of last season.
 The defense needs to be patched up, especially at linebacker, and the quarterback position is going to be watched closely.
 Newton played just two games a year ago and underwent foot surgery in December. Stidham threw just four passes as a rookie while spending most of his time watching Brady.
 So many questions for a team that is not used to having so much uncertainty.
 And on top of all that, the biggest question of all is whether the NFL can make it to Feb. 7 when the Super Bowl is scheduled to be played at Brady's new home in Tampa.
 Indeed, the 2020 season is going to be a radically different one for the Patriots.

A court has dropped charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against four Islamic State (IS) suspects arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police in January after a brief exchange of fire.
 The case was later transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which filed a chargesheet against the suspects on July 6.
 Additional Sessions Judge Praveen Singh, however, found the chargesheet to be “lacking clarity” and specific questions were asked with regard to “availability of evidence.”
 In an order dated July 22, the court asked the NIA if it had cited “any evidence with regard to the offences under the UA(P) Act, except the disclosure statements and pointing out memos of the accused.” Charges have also been filed under other sections of Indian Penal Code and Arms Act against the suspects.
 An NIA spokesperson did not respond to queries on the court dropping charges under various section of the UAPA against the four suspects. The next date of hearing in the case is August 14.
 The accused have been identified as Khaja Moideen, Abdul Samad, Syed Ali Nawas and Jaffar Ali.
 Moideen (52) is wanted by the NIA in two other cases asa well. The two cases that were registered by the Tamil Nadu police on December 28 last year and the Bengaluru police on January 10 this year were also transferred to the NIA.
 In a chargesheet filed on June 23 against 12 IS suspects in the Chennai case, including Moideen, the NIA said “Investigation of the case revealed that after the release of the key conspirator and ISIS/Daish terrorist named Khaja Mohideen on bail in a case relating to the murder of a Hindu leader from Central Prison, Puzhal, in February, 2019, he had conspired with one Liyakath Ali with the intention of furthering the activities of ISIS/ Daish in India.”
 NIA said Moideen and Ali procured a large number of SIM cards that were fraudulently activated by accused Pachaiyappan and Rajesh at Chennai between September and December, 2019.
 “In furtherance of the conspiracy, Khaja Mohideen and Mahboob Pasha also procured through the co-conspirators, country-made firearms and prohibited ammunition, besides jungle camping equipment, pursuant to their intention to establish a wilayah (province) of ISIS/ Daish near forests in South India with a view to waging violent jihad on behalf of the global terrorist organization,” NIA said in its June 23 chargesheet.

BOSTON -- The Senate kept legal sports betting out of the economic development bill it passed Wednesday night, but key senators said they still plan to eventually consider the issue that's been under study for more than two years on Beacon Hill.
 The House approved legal sports betting in its economic development bill, but the Senate version emerged from the Senate Ways and Means Committee without language allowing sports wagers and Senate leadership beat back attempts to amend the bill to authorize betting, bringing momentum on the issue to a halt for the time being.
 "I believe that, certainly, the time is close and we are going to be tackling this issue," Senate Ways and Means Chairman Michael Rodrigues said Wednesday as he asked senators to reject an amendment Sen. Michael Brady filed to allow some forms of betting. "But the time is not now, nor is this the proper vehicle to do so."
 Massachusetts lawmakers have been considering whether to legalize sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 ruled that the nearly- nationwide prohibition on sports wagering was unconstitutional and gave states the ability to legalize the activity. Gov. Charlie Baker filed a bill to legalize the activity in 2019 and has included millions of dollars of assumed sports betting revenue in each of his last two budget proposals.
 Eighteen states -- including neighboring Rhode Island, New Hampshire and New York -- have already authorized some form of legal sports betting, according to ESPN.
 Sen. Eric Lesser, the Senate chair of the Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies that reviewed sports betting proposals, said Wednesday that he and other senators have "been actively engaged in conversations both with our House counterparts on that committee, and with the relevant stakeholders from every angle, and every side of the issue," but is not yet ready to move forward on sports betting.
 When a sports betting bill emerged from the Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies in late February, Lesser and every other senator on the committee chose not to weigh in one way or another on the legislation. Instead, Lesser said at the time, "the Senate will consider sports wagering legislation if or when something is sent to us from the House."
 On Wednesday, nearly 19 months into the two-year session, Lesser said he "watched with interest, of course, what's happened in the House over the last few days," but said the time was still not right to consider legalizing sports betting as he too urged the rejection of Brady's amendment.
 "We have every intention to continue the engagement on this topic. It does pose great promise for the state and it does pose a very promising source of revenue and economic development and jobs for the state, when properly implemented and when done right," he said. "We have every intention to do that, but this specific bill on this specific day -- which we pointed out earlier in our session when debate began is about emergency response, economically, to the coronavirus depression that we find ourselves in at this specific moment -- we need to hold."
 Brady had argued that legalizing sports betting is "long overdue" in Massachusetts and that the Bay State is losing out on money that residents are spending to bet on sports in other states.
 "I hear from my constituents, people are going to Rhode Island, which from my area that I represent is only a 30-minute ride away," Brady, of Brockton, said. "People want to do this. They're doing it whether we do it ... this is what people want to do. It's an option and it's a big revenue boost."
 The Massachusetts Gaming Commission has estimated that sports betting could generate between $9 million and $61 million in annual state tax revenue, depending on the tax rate. Baker has included $35 million in sports betting revenue in each of his last two annual budget plans, and the bill that came out of the Economic Development Committee in February was estimated to produce $20 million in annual revenue for the state.
 By comparison, Massachusetts had been generating at least $20 million in tax revenue each month from a slots parlor and two resort casinos before the COVID-19 pandemic forced casinos to close for four months and reopen under capacity restrictions.
 Though much of the debate has revolved around how to set up a legal sports betting framework, there are some lawmakers for whom the question is still whether they want to make sports betting legal at all. Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem, who opposed the 2011 expansion of casino gambling in Massachusetts, told the News Service in March that she is "inclined" to oppose sports betting and suggested the issue might not be a priority for others in the Senate.
 "There's a lot of things I see coming down the pike and I don't know where this fits in," Creem, the Senate's second in command, told the News Service in March, just before the COVID-19 pandemic upended legislative priorities and seriously changed the state's financial picture. "I don't know where it is on the list of priorities."
 The sports betting language the House approved as part of its economic development bill was not the same as the sports betting bill the House members of the Economic Development Committee approved back in February. Among the key changes was the addition of a carveout that would see 1 percent of gross revenue generated by contests held in Massachusetts go to the owner of whichever venue hosts the contest.
 "This may be the first sports betting bill in the U.S. that includes a 'venue- specific' integrity fee, payable to the operator of the venue instead of the sports governing body," Daniel Wallach, co-founding director of the University of New Hampshire School of Law's Sports Wagering & Integrity program, tweeted about the House bill. "Obvious beneficiaries are: Robert Kraft, John Henry, Wyc Grousbeck, Jeremy Jacobs, and local colleges."
 Rep. Shawn Dooley, through an amendment to the House economic development bill, sought to redirect 1 percent of revenue from local contests to Massachusetts cities and towns.
 "We do not need to be helping the rich get richer. This is very, very simple in so much that we need the money. They don't need the money," Dooley said. "Our cities and towns are struggling. Our schools are struggling. We're laying off teachers. We're laying off firefighters, we're laying off police officers and to have this money just go -- we're collecting the vig as it were for these sports enterprises, these major, major corporations -- it doesn't make sense."
 Rep. Ken Gordon asked that representatives reject Dooley's amendment and keep the language calling for the revenues to be paid to venue owners because, he said, the money is for a specific purpose.
 "It's used for security at the venue and the reason is that when these contests occur, be it at Fenway Park, at the garden, etc., these venues have to beef up their security because they've got to protect against communication from someone who may be there to have a conversation that we don't want to occur," he said. "And so they have expenses and this is solely to address those expenses."
 Ultimately, Dooley's amendment was rejected 33-126.

Police Chief Roger Pohlman worked with council members to craft the task force and its policies. He stated, “The police department is looking forward to participating in the new Policy Task Force. We can’t fix the world. But we can commit to fix what needs fixing here in Red Wing. And for the sake of our children and the future of this city we care so much about, we have to get it right.”
 Pohlman later added:
 “As a peace officer, my fundamental duty is to serve humankind; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder.”
 Misinformation about the task force has been appearing on social media. One rumor is that the task force is only open to people of color. In reality, anyone is welcome to apply. The city stated that an emphasis will be placed on ensuring people of color are on the task force, not that white people are excluded. Also, everyone on the task force will be paid for each meeting they attend. This does not exclude any white members.
 A few individuals who spoke Monday emphasized that they believe there is bias in the Red Wing Police Department.
 “It really breaks my heart that you have to think about, ‘should I call 911, should I call Red Wing police, will they help me based off who I am, what color my skin is," Vonch said with tears in her eyes. "It’s very bias, it’s very divided.”
