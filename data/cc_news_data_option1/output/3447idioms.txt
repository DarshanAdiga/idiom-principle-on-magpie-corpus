And while he's generally appreciated for a variety of qualities across the board, more praise ought to be given to his versatility. More specifically, his ability to find chemistry with his collaborator no matter how much the styles may differ.

With the log jam currently at receiver for the Steelers, he’d really have to blow you away as a returner for him to make the 53 as he hasn’t shown that he can offer you that much as a true slot receiver in the NFL, yet. Regardless of many fans’ preconceived notions of Ryan Switzer and the want to push him off the roster there’s simply nothing currently on tape for McCloud that suggests he’s a better player. Switzer is far and away the better route runner and a safer option as a returner. Oh, and him being buds with #7 doesn’t hurt his chances either.

The Jetta Sportwagen has not been rated using the government's new, more strenuous 2011 crash-testing procedures. Its 2010 ratings (which aren't comparable to the new 2011 tests) were a top five stars for the driver in head-on collisions, four stars for the front passenger and five stars for both the front and rear in side impacts. In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's crash testing, the Sportwagen received the top score of "Good" in the frontal-offset, side and roof strength tests.
 ## Driving
 For most shoppers in this segment, a comfy ride matters more than razor-sharp moves. By this measure, the 2011 Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen is a fine companion in day-to-day driving. It swallows bumps and provides a relatively quiet cabin from which to endure the daily grind. If you do decide to drive aggressively, the Jetta's steering is nicely weighted and accurate, though significant body roll puts a damper on the level of fun.

BOISE — Anyone attending a session of the Idaho Legislature — whether as a spectator, lobbyist, journalist or someone testifying — usually must follow a certain set of rules.
 Spectators in the audience are asked to listen quietly and respectfully. People testifying must adhere to time limits. Lobbyists and activists follow dress codes banning clothing with political slogans. Only journalists credentialed by the Idaho Press Club’s Capital Correspondents’ Association are allowed on the House and Senate floors with lawmakers or in areas reserved for the press.
 So why was a crowd of spectators allowed to enter and participate in the first day of the Idaho State Legislature’s special session after protesting masks and social distancing guidelines, chanting loudly and struggling to enter a door with such force it shattered a glass window?

E' stata rinviata la prova scritta del maxi concorso regionale per gli infermieri, in programma dal 7 all'11 settembre alla Fiera del Levante a Bari.      Regione Puglia e ASL Bari - azienda capofila per le procedure concorsuali - visto l'aumento significativo dei contagi registrati negli ultimi giorni in Italia – hanno deciso in via precauzionale di rinviare la prova scritta del concorso unico regionale per 566 infermieri a tempo indeterminato.      Nonostante le stringenti misure anti Covid previste dalla ASL, è stato necessario valutare l'impatto sul sistema sanitario regionale e anche nazionale, legato alla affluenza e agli spostamenti di quasi 17mila persone in arrivo in Puglia da più regioni italiane. Senza considerare l'importanza nella fase attuale della emergenza di avere in servizio e dunque operative figure indispensabili come quelle degli infermieri in strutture sanitarie e socio sanitarie.   La ASL di Bari aveva predisposto nelle settimane scorse le modalità di svolgimento delle prove in massima sicurezza. Tuttavia in base all'attuale andamento epidemiologico, è parso opportuno evitare lo svolgimento di un concorso con un numero così significativo di partecipanti.      Regione e ASL si attiveranno per valutare le modalità alternative – a distanza - sulla base del recente decreto legislativo 34/2020 convertito in legge n.77 del 17 luglio 2020, in cui è prevista la possibilità di tenere concorsi in massima sicurezza ricorrendo alla tecnologia digitale, in tutte le pubbliche amministrazioni, comprese le aziende sanitarie.      Resta, invece, invariato il cronoprogramma per la graduatoria della procedura di mobilità volontaria per 566 posti di collaboratore professionale sanitario – infermiere, che sarà pronta entro la prima metà di settembre. In linea con gli impegni presi e nel rispetto delle legittime aspettative del personale infermieristico, la ASL si era già attivata per definire il personale in possesso dei requisiti di stabilizzazione 2019 - 2020 prima del concorso e oggi sta portando avanti il completamento delle procedure. E' infatti in corso di adozione da parte dell'azienda una delibera con la quale prende atto delle domande ricevute per cui gli infermieri saranno immediatamente chiamati per la conversione del rapporto di lavoro da tempo determinato a tempo indeterminato.

I spent most of my toddler years in Oamaru and started school at St Joseph's. I remember it so well. We moved away that year, but my parents then moved back to Oamaru in my first year at Otago University. I would come home and spend my university holidays there for the next four years. I loved coming home to Oamaru, and it really felt like home. We lived in the Redcastle at St Kevin's College, as my dad was the principal there. It was an incredible place to live. My holiday jobs included working as a motel cleaner and briefly at Whitestone Cheese Cafe, but my favourite holiday job was working at a local rest-home. I learnt the value of looking after our elderly, and also our health. I learnt the value of family - and if family isn't around you, treat everyone around you like family. Oamaru has such a community and family feel to it - something I have always appreciated, and something I value highly.

In terms of everyday motoring, the Jetta Sportwagen offers a comfortable ride and a relatively quiet interior. TDI models are light-years ahead of the diesel-powered passenger cars of decades past, though this powertrain does generate a bit more vibration and noise than the gasoline engine. But in our opinion, the TDI is the way to go thanks to its combination of snappier acceleration and outstanding fuel economy.
 ## Interior
 In a rare case of the original being better than the "new and improved" version, the 2012 Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen offers an interior that's noticeably nicer than the more recently redesigned Jetta sedan. Materials are top quality, with soft-touch plastics and handsome metal trim. Even the premium vinyl "leatherette" upholstery in the SE and TDI models looks and feels a lot better in person than its description might imply.

 The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, better known as the SECURE Act, was passed in December 2019 and includes numerous changes that affect how retirement plans, including IRAs, must be managed. One of those changes increases the age retirees are required to start taking their Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). Prior to the SECURE Act, retirees had to begin taking their RMD at age 70½; now they can wait until age 72.
 The new required trigger date to take RMDs for an IRA owner is April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual reaches the age 72, rather than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70½. The new rules went into effect as of Jan. 1, 2020. As a result, 2019 was the last year that \"reaching age 70½\" has any significance for RMDs. Those who reach 70½ after 2019 don't have to start RMDs until age 72 (the earliest year that can occur is 2021).
 So, what are some other impacts to owners of IRAs resulting from the SECURE Act? Below are just a few.
 Under previous law, people working past age 70½ couldn't contribute to a traditional IRA, but as a result of the SECURE Act, those employed past 70½ can continue to add to an IRA, either deductible or non-deductible, depending on certain factors, such as income, filing status, earned compensation and active status in a qualified plan. The bottom line in general is that someone age 70½ or older can now contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if they are age 50 or older) to an IRA.
 The age change also impacts tax strategies such as Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs). Although the SECURE Act changes the age at which RMDs must begin, the law made no change to the age at which QCDs may begin (which is also age 70½). A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from your IRA, payable directly to a qualified charity. Amounts distributed as a QCD can be counted toward satisfying your RMD for the year, up to $100,000 (this limit has not changed). The QCD is excluded from your taxable income. This is not the case with a regular withdrawal from an IRA, even if you use the money to make a charitable contribution later on. If you take a withdrawal, the funds would be counted as taxable income even if you later offset that income with the charitable contribution deduction. So, the added 1½ years until it is now mandatory to take an RMD (i.e., age 70 ½ to age 72) could be a good retirement tool.
 The full impact of the SECURE Act likely will not be felt for many years - or even decades - but now is the time to partake in a thorough review of your retirement strategy to see how and if these changes affect you. Delaying could result in your falling into a higher tax bracket or create a negative impact on other retirement benefits such as Social Security or Medicare.
 Because so many of these changes are complex and involve long-term financial and tax planning strategies, it may be wise to work with a CPA or other professional tax adviser to be sure the retirement strategies you choose today are the best for you and your family in the long run.

Edinburgh’s Playtime collective this Thursday begins a new programme of live-streamed jazz concerts which will run throughout September and into October.
 Following an experimental series of streams that included various members of the core Playtime quartet working in their respective homes, the collective, which is comprised of Scottish National Jazz Orchestra saxophonist Martin Kershaw, guitarist Graeme Stephen, bassist Mario Caribe and drummer Tom Bancroft, moved to Pathhead Village Hall in June.
 There, with social distancing and recording and filming operatives, they were able to establish a good internet connection. They have since been staging regular concerts, often playing to audiences well in excess of the numbers attracted to their home venue, The Outhouse in Broughton Street Lane.
 “We took a while to get to grips with the whole live-streaming thing,” says Bancroft, who lives in Pathhead and who negotiated with the village hall committee for the safe use of the venue.

ABOARD EL AL FLIGHT TO THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — A Star of David-adorned El Al plane took off Monday from Israel’s Ben-Gurion Airport, carrying a high- ranking American and Israeli delegation to Abu Dhabi in the first-ever direct commercial passenger flight to the United Arab Emirates.
 The Israeli flag carrier’s flight marks the implementation of the historic U.S.-brokered deal to normalize relations between the two nations and solidifies the long-clandestine ties between them that have evolved over years of shared enmity toward Iran.
 With the U.S. as matchmaker, Israel and the UAE agreed earlier this month to work toward normalization, which would make the UAE the third Arab nation to have full relations with Israel, after Egypt and Jordan. But unlike those two nations, Israel has never fought a war against the UAE and hopes to have much- warmer relations.
 The American delegation includes President Donald Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as national security adviser Robert O’Brien, Mideast envoy Avi Berkowitz and envoy for Iran Brian Hook. Israel will be represented by national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat and the director generals of several ministries, who will meet with their Emirati counterparts.
 “While this is a historic flight, we hope that this will start an even more historic journey for the Middle East and beyond,” Kushner told reporters before boarding the plane.
 Meir Ben-Shabbat, Israel’s national security adviser and head of the Israeli delegation, said he was excited about the trip and that the aim was to lay the groundwork for cooperation in areas like tourism, medicine, technology and trade.
 “This morning the traditional greeting of ‘go in peace’ takes on a special significance for us," he said.
 The El Al flight, numbered LY971 as a gesture to the UAE’s international calling code number, flew into Saudi Arabian airspace shortly after takeoff and later passed over the capital, Riyadh. That marked another historic first for Israel and at least an acquiescence by the kingdom for the UAE's move.
 Saudi King Salman, along with other Gulf Arab leaders to varying degrees, maintain their boycotts of Israel in support of Palestinians obtaining an independent state. Any long-term flights between Israel and the UAE would require Saudi clearance to be profitable. Otherwise the three hour, 20 minute flight would take more than seven hours.
 El Al spokesman Stanley Morais said the 737-900 is equipped with a missile- defense system, a standard feature on these types of planes and a requirement for this flight. After grounding its fleet due to the coronavirus, it is the airline’s first flight since July 1.
 The plane was decorated with the the words for peace in Arabic, Hebrew and English above the pilot’s window. Journalists were handed special face masks decorated with the Israeli and Emirati flags. The seat protectors said “Making History” in all three languages, and Israeli folk music played in the background.
 The plane's captain, Tal Becker, said he has not worked for several months and received a call out of the blue asking him to prepare for the flight.
 The 45-year veteran, who is the senior captain in El Al’s 737 fleet, said he never dreamed of flying to Abu Dhabi, calling it a “very special feeling.”
 The Israeli delegation will stay in the capital, Abu Dhabi, for one night before returning home on El Al flight LY972, a nod to Israel’s international calling code.
 Private jets have earlier flown between the two nations as part of covert talks, and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways flew cargo freighters to Israel before to deliver coronavirus aid to the Palestinians. But the high-profile flight Monday, eagerly promoted by U.S. officials, looks to place a solid stamp on the surprise Aug. 13 White House announcement of Israel and the UAE establishing ties.
 Since then, telephone calls were connected, and the UAE’s ruler issued a decree formally ending the country’s decades-long boycott of Israel. Some Israeli firms have already signed deals with Emirati counterparts, but Monday’s visit is expected to usher in a slew of further business cooperation. The official repeal of the boycott looks to open the door to more joint ventures, such as in aviation, banking and finance.
 The UAE has touted the deal as a tool to force Israel into halting its contentious plan to annex parts of the West Bank sought by the Palestinians for their future state. It also may help the Emirates acquire advanced U.S. weapons systems that have been previously unattainable, such as the F-35 fighter jet. Currently, Israel is the only country in the region with the stealth warplanes.
 The Palestinians, however, have fiercely opposed the normalization as peeling away one of their few advantages in moribund peace talks with Israel. Palestinians have held public protests and burned the UAE flag in anger.
 Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said it was “very painful” to see the flight, which he said was a “clear violation of the Arab position on the Arab-Israeli conflict.”
 "We had hoped to see an Emirati plane landing in a liberated Jerusalem,” he added.
 Israelis eagerly anticipate the prospect of mutual embassies, expanding tourism to the Gulf and solidifying business opportunities with another country that shares its penchant for technology and innovation.
 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has touted the deal as validation of his vision that regional peace doesn’t have to go through Palestinian acquiescence and come at the cost of ceding land. But he has come under fire from supporters at home for seemingly giving up on dreams of annexation and tacitly agreeing to a questionable arms sale that could undermine Israel’s regional superiority. Netanyahu denies such a deal exists.
 In a Facebook post, Netanyahu said Monday “is a historic day for the state of Israel that I have worked to achieve for decades."
 For Trump, the accord delivers a key foreign policy victory as he faces a tough reelection campaign.
 On Sunday, Kushner said “the stage is now set” for other Arab countries to follow the UAE. However, he gave no indication that any other deals are imminent, despite a swing through the region last week by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

 Friday Night Lights might turn into Must See TV for area high school football teams in the spring.
   
 The Michigan High School Athletic Association is relaxing its rules and policies when it comes to the state's high schools broadcasting sporting events live and some local athletic directors - such as Tim Duffy at Airport and Kris Isom at Adrian Madison - are getting ready to go live.
   
 "It's something different and if we can't have fans or all of the fans that want to come to the game, it's a way for them to see it," said Isom. "There are some costs, but we are going through that now. It's exciting to be part of it."
   
 The MHSAA Executive Committee approved the new guidelines just this week. Here's how it works:
   
 The MHSAA schools will have streaming rights to their home events. Members can utilize the MHSAA's School Broadcast Program and the Pixelott cameras or stream athletic events on a media platform of their choosing without restrictions. For games that the school does not stream, they may assign rights to a third party, such as a local media outlet.
   
 In the past, the MHSAA prohibited live broadcast of regular season and state tournament events unless it was run through them and the NFHS. Some restrictions will still be in place for state tournament events.
   
 "It goes right in line with everything that is going on right now," Duffy said. "Things are changing in schools and school sports. It is great that the leadership of the MHSAA are willing to do this."
   
 Duffy said that as a district Airport has established its own YouTube channel to broadcast some school events, such as graduation. He said he has had preliminary discussions with the technology team at the district who agree that the same platform can be used to broadcast sporting events.
   
 In the past, Duffy said, most fans have been willing to overcome whatever obstacles necessary - such as cold weather, for example - to attend Jets athletic events.
   
 But if crowds are limited due to the coronavirus, this would still allow them to watch games.
   
 "For those people, the ability to stay home and watch the game is great," he said. "The schools will just have to decide how this is going to work."
   
 Duffy said it's not just football games that he plans on broadcasting, but other sports as well.
   
 Several area school officials said they are exploring either the Pixellott units or other platforms to broadcast games.
   
 Erie Mason Athletic Director Kelly Trainor said Mason expects to have the Pixellott units installed in the next few weeks. Those cameras are self- operating, designed to follow the action. That means once the event starts, they can operate without anyone physically needed to operate the camera.
   
 "For those events not in the gym or on the football field, we will try to stream them using Facebook Live," Trainor said.
   
 Same at Flat Rock, says John Clair, athletic director.
   
 "Flat Rock is going to try and stream the events live on our Twitter and Instagram," he said. "We are going to play this by ear."
   
 Bedford and Whiteford already have games broadcast by Buckeye Cablevision in Toledo. Those packages could be expanded.
   
 "If we play in the spring, it will be a good time for content for them," Whiteford athletic director Jason Mensing said.
   
 Besides just simply broadcasting the games, individual districts could get creative and utilize students as commentators or to run cameras or allow a third-party to do so. A school could, for example, set up its own network of sorts to broadcast its athletic events on Facebook, YouTube or its own Web site.
   
 Adrian High School is still figuring out what its plan will be but athletic director Andrew Mains said they'll be doing something.
   
 "We are exploring four to six different options," he said. "The tough part right now is that almost every school in the country is also looking at these options so install times are delayed.
   
 "Our hope is that we are able to have something that if spectators are limited, they will still be able to see the game."

The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act, better known as the SECURE Act, was passed in December 2019 and includes numerous changes that affect how retirement plans, including IRAs, must be managed. One of those changes increases the age retirees are required to start taking their Required Minimum Distribution (RMD). Prior to the SECURE Act, retirees had to begin taking their RMD at age 70½; now they can wait until age 72.
 The new required trigger date to take RMDs for an IRA owner is April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual reaches the age 72, rather than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70½. The new rules went into effect as of Jan. 1, 2020. As a result, 2019 was the last year that "reaching age 70½" has any significance for RMDs. Those who reach 70½ after 2019 don't have to start RMDs until age 72 (the earliest year that can occur is 2021).
 So, what are some other impacts to owners of IRAs resulting from the SECURE Act? Below are just a few.
 Under previous law, people working past age 70½ couldn't contribute to a traditional IRA, but as a result of the SECURE Act, those employed past 70½ can continue to add to an IRA, either deductible or non-deductible, depending on certain factors, such as income, filing status, earned compensation and active status in a qualified plan. The bottom line in general is that someone age 70½ or older can now contribute up to $6,000 ($7,000 if they are age 50 or older) to an IRA.
 The age change also impacts tax strategies such as Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs). Although the SECURE Act changes the age at which RMDs must begin, the law made no change to the age at which QCDs may begin (which is also age 70½). A QCD is a direct transfer of funds from your IRA, payable directly to a qualified charity. Amounts distributed as a QCD can be counted toward satisfying your RMD for the year, up to $100,000 (this limit has not changed). The QCD is excluded from your taxable income. This is not the case with a regular withdrawal from an IRA, even if you use the money to make a charitable contribution later on. If you take a withdrawal, the funds would be counted as taxable income even if you later offset that income with the charitable contribution deduction. So, the added 1½ years until it is now mandatory to take an RMD (i.e., age 70 ½ to age 72) could be a good retirement tool.
 The full impact of the SECURE Act likely will not be felt for many years - or even decades - but now is the time to partake in a thorough review of your retirement strategy to see how and if these changes affect you. Delaying could result in your falling into a higher tax bracket or create a negative impact on other retirement benefits such as Social Security or Medicare.
 Because so many of these changes are complex and involve long-term financial and tax planning strategies, it may be wise to work with a CPA or other professional tax adviser to be sure the retirement strategies you choose today are the best for you and your family in the long run.

Raising questions over the accuracy of accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has said the budget assumptions of the Assam government were "not realistic" in 2018-19 and various policy initiatives were not fulfilled due to "non-completion" of the preparatory works.
 In its audit report on the the state's finances for the year ending March 31, 2019, which was tabled in the Assam Assembly on August 31, the CAG said the government failed to take corrective steps despite the auditor pointing out the lacunae every year.
 "Budgetary assumptions of the state government were not realistic during 2018-19 and despite carrying out an elaborate pre-budget exercise to bring about efficiency and transparency in budget formulation and execution, budgetary estimates were off the mark to a considerable extent," it said.
