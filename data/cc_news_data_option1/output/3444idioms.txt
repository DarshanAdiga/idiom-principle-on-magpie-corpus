That Kalergi would be so crass as to state Jews were the only appropriate ethnicity to rule a European Union basically acknowledges the fact of Jewish covert rule of all European countries while making it obvious that Kalergi was bought off by the masons who in fact are below Jewish secret societies in the world "pecking order'

The overall concept is pretty straightforward. Infected individuals excrete the pathogen, which gets flushed down the toilet or washed down the drain. The pathogen - or fragments of its genes - then travel through a community's sewage system to a treatment plant, where careful sampling can detect its presence.

Post-hatchling sea turtles are young and need to feed and grow rapidly. This means they are particularly at risk from the harmful consequences of ingesting plastic. We find it especially troubling that almost all of the animals we assessed had ingested plastic in such large quantities. Plastic pollution is only one of many human-related threats that these charismatic and endangered creatures face at sea.

While I think much of the West will succumb and disappear into a Dark Age from which it won't emerge until generations later as something different, others around the world, including some of the West will see the light, gird their loins and resist. I can't see what sort of civilizational pole will emerge in the West when its people become the equivalent of breeding all breeds of dogs together. Small, brown mutts can be endearing, but they never win any awards and only rarely exhibit any of the qualities around which a distinct breed can be developed. So it is with civilizations. Nevertheless, given enough time I expect something will emerge.

Whether or not a vaccine mandate is appropriate will depend upon how safe the vaccine is determined to be, what it protects against and how well it offers protection. The Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn has been adamant that the agency "will not cut corners" in their vaccine review process, and that the decision "will be based on science and data." Any suggestion otherwise would damage public trust.

Some of the elite Whites are about power and control, but we are now finding that a lot of them are dual-citizen Whites. These dual-citizen Whites have another agenda. They already have the wealth, and wealth buys you a lot of power and control. They have worked tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, manipulating, bribing, blackmailing, threatening in order to change laws, take over the media, big Tech, academia and own the politicians. When you have that kind of power, you have a virtual monopoly on what goes on.

By a small margin, I found Part II to be more interesting than the first. It’s comprised of a very ambitious survey of the origins and trajectory of all the contemporary ideological currents underpinning the European Union we see today. There are no less than eleven small chapters critically exploring the evolution of cosmopolitanism (including Kantian, proletarian, critical, universal, liberal and pluralistic variants). The text then moves to a three- chapter exploration liberalism, before ending with a three-chapter exploration of conservatism, including a critique of neoconservatism.
