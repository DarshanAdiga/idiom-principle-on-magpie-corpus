Japan’s exports in July plunged 19.2% from a year ago, as the coronavirus pandemic continued to slam the world’s third largest economy, government data showed Wednesday. The Finance Ministry’s provisional numbers showed Japan’s imports fell 22.3% in July. Exports to the U.S. especially suffered, declining 19.5% last month, as exports fell in plastic goods, iron and steel and computer parts. But Japan recorded its first trade surplus in four months on the back of a recovery in China.

New Zealand appeared to be gaining control over a coronavirus outbreak in Auckland after just five new community infections were reported Wednesday amid record levels of testing and contact tracing. A sixth infection was found in a quarantined traveler who had returned from Qatar. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said 500 more military personnel would be deployed to quarantine hotels as the nation looks to reduce the number of private security guards it employs and tighten its border controls. Health authorities have still not figured out how the outbreak began after the country went 102 days without the virus spreading in the community. The discovery of the outbreak last week prompted authorities to put the nation’s largest city into a two-week lockdown.

That means Black and Hispanic protesters will be most affected in the long term if they're arrested at demonstrations. "These protests going on all around the country are all about racial inequities and bias in our criminal legal system, and it doesn't stop with the police," Avery says. "It permeates throughout all these other aspects of life."

It is very difficult to evaluate teachers and compensate them according to their performance. Yet those same difficulties exist in evaluating doctors and lawyers, and we are almost always able to identify -- and compensate -- excellent practitioners.
 Those teachers who fall short should be retrained. Failing that, they may be offered administrative posts to fulfill their motivation to help children or encouraged to find careers in which they can excel.
 These moves are not rocket science. They are obvious, commonsense ways to educate our children. All it takes is leadership. Where might we find that?

“Taking advantage of Monday qualifiers is crucial because if you miss the cut, you are right back to the drawing board,” Young said last week. “They’re not much fun. You show up on Sunday afternoon and you know if you’re not 5-under through 10, you’re probably out of luck. It’s a brutal road.”
 Young had an outstanding career for the Deacons making All-ACC three times and All-ACC Academic twice. He won twice during his time at Wake Forest despite battling a wrist injury during his junior season and a back issue his senior season.
 Young admits he’s been on the fast track for the last three weeks, but he was ready for it.
 “It's nice to have some confidence knowing I can compete," Young said. "You really have to go low on this tour and you have to be consistent."
 Young said he wasn't sure he wanted to try the Monday qualifier in Nebraska because he had missed the three previous tries at getting into a Korn Ferry Tour tournament.
 "I was kind of on the fence but I decided to go and that was a good choice because here we are," Young said.
 One of his goals over the next three weeks is to get at least 269 points, which would give him temporary status on the Korn Ferry Tour. He has 209 points to rank 75th on the tour.
 "That's something I'm shooting for because that gives me more options," Young said. "I've been playing a lot of golf here but I think that's good for my game because I usually do better as the weeks go on."

Dal comitato sull'ordine e la sicurezza pubblica che si è tenuto mercoledì mattina, coordiato dalla prefettura di Terni, la linea - in fatto di 'movida' e relativi controlli - è stata quella di proseguire nel monitoraggio, valutare, controllare. Ma non quella di attuare da subito interventi drastici o radicalmente diversi da quelli messi in campo sinora. Anche in attesa di capire, forse, che piega prenderà l'evoluzione dei contagi sul territorio ternano e regionale. Se quindi il Comune di Perugia ha emanato un'ordinanza che individua vie e piazze dove è obbligatorio indossare la mascherina, per il momento a Terni si preferisce verificare la situazione, tenendo sì conto delle nuove norme, ma anche cercando di comprendere appieno i criteri alla base delle indicazioni ministeriali. Che devono essere tradotti in controlli concreti e 'confini' non sempre semplici da stabilire.

For more than 50 years, L.Q. Jones was a familiar supporting character actor in some 100 films and hundreds more television shows. Lanky, tough and athletic, Jones could tackle any role although was often cast as the "heavy" in westerns and dramas, projecting the "bad guy" image with merely a sinister smirk or a menacing twinkle in the eye.      Born and raised in Texas as Justus McQueen, relatives took care of the young boy after his mother was killed in a car accident.      "I was born in Beaumont, although they may try to disclaim me, but it's too late now!" says Jones, who turned 93 on Aug. 19. "We moved around quite a bit, to Houston to Dallas to Oklahoma City, back to Beaumont, and finally Port Neches. I had a horse by the time I was 8 or 9 and grew up around tough rodeo people - my uncle was into roping - so westerns were easy and fun."      In college, at the University of Texas at Austin, his roommate for over a year was Fess Parker. While the future "Daniel Boone" actor moved west to Hollywood, McQueen headed south and took up ranching in Nicaragua. When Parker sent his buddy a copy of Leon Uris' war novel "Battle Cry," about to be filmed, McQueen thought one character could be his ticket to Hollywood.      "Fess encouraged me to come out and drew me a map on the back of a laundry shirt stuffing showing how to get to the studio. Within two days of arriving, I had the part of L.Q. Jones in 'Battle Cry' and probably would never have been in the business had it not been for Fess."      Despite lacking Hollywood experience, McQueen had worked some comedy acts during college to help pay the bills, so he took to playing the comic relief character in the 1955 war drama to act like a veteran. Adopting his screen character's name as his own, the lad from Texas quickly settled into Hollywood.      Jones was cast in Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch," having become a favorite among the director's casting repertoire. "Sam was a genius and I loved him, but he was a basket case. He drove everybody nuts."      That was evident during the production of "Major Dundee" with Charlton Heston.      "Heston was using a real saber for one scene," he recalled. "Sam made him so mad, Chuck came within an eyelash of cutting Sam in two - and it scared Chuck because he damn near did it. Sam found a way to get under your skin to get what he wanted out of you."      While Jones calls "The Wild Bunch" a "hell of a movie," he says Peckinpah's "'Ride the High Country' was the best Sam ever made, just gorgeous to watch, although I cry like a baby at the ending." Jones is a member of a ruthless family that tackles Joel McCrea and Randolph Scott as they attempt to rescue Mariette Hartley.      "Joel was the best human being I ever met and Randy wasn't far behind him, so the two of them together make one of the best Saturday afternoon westerns you could ever sit and watch over a bowl of popcorn."      While he had a few lead film roles, Jones says he enjoyed his supporting roles and went after every job he could. But there was one he missed.      "I was at my agent's one day and the phone rang. It was Stanley Kubrick offering a part in 'Dr. Strangelove.' Well, I would have walked barefoot across the state to work with him, but when he was ready to shoot I was tied up with another picture. The role (of Major 'King' Kong) went to Slim Pickens. But thank goodness it did, could you imagine anyone else in that part?"      Jones appeared in movies with countless fellow character actors, not to mention big stars such as James Coburn, Audie Murphy, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Glenn Ford. He even appeared in three Elvis Presley films. But his first role in "Battle Cry" provided a valuable lesson.      "I had a hundred 'directors' \- lighting, sound, wardrobe people, all the crew helping out a rookie actor and everyone helping each other," says Jones. "You learn from them, work your butt off, and with a little luck have a successful career. I suppose I could have worked my way up the acting food chain, but character work was very rewarding and great fun. I loved playing the heavies because I could do what I wanted and got to work with the best in the business, so I consider myself very lucky."   Nick Thomas teaches at Auburn University at Montgomery, Alabama, and has written features, columns and interviews for more than 850 newspapers and magazines. The interview with Jones was conducted in 2017. See www.getnickt.org.

  EGA's GAC project was one of the largest greenfield investments in Guinea in the last 40 years, and cost some US$1.4 billion to develop. More than half the funds were provided by the largest greenfield mining project financing ever in Guinea a US$750 million loan from development finance institutions, export credit agencies and international commercial banks.


  GAC invests in social and environmental projects in neighbouring communities, including building schools, health centres, supporting livelihood development and educational programmes, and running health awareness campaigns that reach tens of thousands of people.


  Once full ramp-up is achieved, GAC is expected to make a direct, indirect and induced economic impact of some US$700 million year over year, which equates to a 5.5 per cent boost to Guinea’s GDP.


  GAC uses trains to transport bauxite ore from its mine inland to the coast. Each train is capable of carrying 10,200 tonnes of ore, which is a similar weight to the Eiffel Tower. So far GAC’s trains have made 722 journeys from the mine to the coast.


  Bauxite ore is transported from GAC’s jetty at the port of Kamsar by self- propelled barge to a trans-shipment point operated in deeper water. This enables EGA to export bauxite ore from GAC using bulk cargo vessels that are amongst the world’s largest, including Capesize ships.

I don't know about other bakers, but I don't get around much. I frequently joke about how most of my time is spent in the "bunker" baking around the clock. The only time I really get to see people and the "outside world" is when I deliver breads around the country every Friday. Bakers are no strangers to burning the midnight oil and to solitude.


  So perhaps we are more equipped to handle realities like the one I woke up to this week. I was ceremoniously informed that I had been exposed to a verified COVID-19 patient and that I had to place myself (and my family) in isolation until it became certain that I (we) had not been infected.


  Isolation is different for a baker than someone who works with computers or say, customer service. Two of my children work in customer service, and within hours they had set themselves us to continue working from home, via the Internet and the phone. For a baker though, it is total shutdown.


  The first noticeable thing was the silence. The heart of our small mom & pop artisan bakery (attached to the back of our house) - the noisy flour sifter, thump thumping its floor-shaking rhythm that can be felt throughout the house - lay silent. The primordial warmth and luminance from the crackling fire in our brick oven was noticeably absent, and the strains of jazz and '60's rock music, which form the backdrop in our daily work place, were muted.


  The only time this reality normally pervades is during the week of Passover, when we take a welcome week of vacation, by choice. We shutter up the bakery for seven days and enjoy quality leisure time spent with the family. This, however, was a different animal. It was something forced upon us, not out of choice. Like most of the rest of the world, we have been very hard hit financially by the corona pandemic, barely eking out a living with the bakery. To have to close up shop for almost two weeks was a cataclysmic blow.


  What made it a worse pill to swallow wass the fact that it was preventable. It was caused by irresponsible negligence, by a youngster who was not meticulous about wearing their mask. Isn't that the rub?


  Even though we are super strict with ourselves, we are being stymied, mostly by young people, who do not fully fathom the repercussions of their "carefree abandon." Repercussions like death and (in the "better case" scenarios) economic collapse, family breakdown and divorce. Just this week, one of our workers shocked us with the fact he was getting divorced.


  Perhaps the scariest thing about COVID-19 is that it is totally dependent on goodwill. You can take the most stringent precautions, but all of that amounts to naught when just one solitary, irresponsible person breaks the link, resulting in catastrophic ripples. I have a strong basic faith in humanity, but I cannot understand or stomach the reckless outlook of "eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow... " that currently pervades a large segment of our youth (and even some "not-so-youth").


  As the more responsible, older generation, we should be clamping down more on our youngsters and not let them place everyone at risk on the premise that "you cannot stop life from going on." They are young and still have their entire lives ahead of them, decades and decades when they will still be able to party, go to restaurants and pubs, go to the beach and cop some rays, go overseas and enjoy summer vacations.


  Meanwhile, while a frantic search is underway for a vaccine, we need to put life in perspective and relinquish and sacrifice much of the partying, the sunbathing, the vacationing and numerous other things that make our lives "normal." The times we are living in are not normal, and we all need to proverbially go a little into our own "bunkers," wait it out and come down like a ton of bricks on those who won't.


  For me personally, it will be two weeks in which I will have more time to devote to my writing and more leisure time with my family. I am one of the "lucky" ones. For me it will simply be an (additional) financial loss that - tough as it may be - is only money! For many, many others it will be tragic loss of near and dear ones who would still have had many more good years to spend with their children and grandchildren if not for reckless behavior of those who lack the responsibility or the good will we all need to see this crisis through.


  What do I know? I'm just a simple baker; right now a baker who cannot bake! And that is not an isolation I enjoy, although I am more equipped for it than most.


  The writer, a master baker originally from Johannesburg, South Africa, lives in Karnei Shomron with his wife Sheryl and four children. He is CEO of the Saidel Jewish Baking Center (jewishbakingcenter.com), that specializes in baking and teaching how to bake healthy, traditional Jewish bread.

Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it would not follow the United Arab Emirates and establish diplomatic ties with Israel until the Jewish state had sealed a peace accord with the Palestinians.


  Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan told reporters on a visit to Berlin that "peace must be achieved with the Palestinians" on the basis of international agreements as a condition for any normalisation of relations with Israel.


  "Once that is achieved all things are possible," he said.


  The surprise Israel-UAE deal last week is only the third such accord Israel has struck with an Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, and raises the prospect of similar accords with other pro-Western Gulf states.


  Until now, Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's biggest economy, has maintained a conspicuous silence over the deal, but local officials have hinted that Riyadh is unlikely to immediately follow in the footsteps of its principle regional ally despite US pressure.


  At a news conference with his German counterpart Heiko Maas, Prince Faisal reiterated criticism of Israel's "unilateral policies" of annexation and building settlements in the West Bank as "illegitimate" and "detrimental" to a two-state solution.


  As part of the landmark deal, Israel agreed to suspend the annexation of occupied West Bank territories, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the plan was not off the table in the long run.


  Palestinians protested the deal as a betrayal by a major player in the Arab world, which has broadly held that normal ties with Israel are only possible once the dispute with the Palestinians is resolved.


  Prince Faisal noted that Saudi Arabia had sponsored 2002 Arab peace initiatives holding out the prospect of a normalisation of ties with Israel but said Riyadh now saw no road to diplomatic relations without a Palestinian peace deal.

It is with deep sorrow that the family of Tracy Charlier announce her peaceful passing on Wednesday, Aug. 12, 2020, at Presbyterian Hospital following a long, hard-fought battle with ovarian cancer. She was 51.      She was born on April 28, 1969, in Butler, and was the daughter of Jill Irvine and the late August Pozgaj.      She attended Seneca Valley High School.      Tracy touched so many lives with her beautiful smile, unwavering faith and determination to see the positive side of every situation. Wise beyond her years, she was an inspiration to never give up on life and to be grateful for each day.      Her courage and unwavering faith set an example for all. She fought harder for her life than the toughest of us. Inside that tiny body was the heart of a warrior with boundless determination.      She was welcomed into heaven with open arms by her husband, Chris Charlier Sr.; her father, James Irvine Sr.; her grandparents, Lois (Hillmar), Robert Stillwagon, her Dado Pozgaj and Mary Pozgaj; her Aunt Joyce Isles; her brother, James (Jimmy) Irvine Jr.; and her beloved golden retriever, Maddie Mae.

  “Revenues for many industries adversely affected by the pandemic and lockdowns just don’t allow for any free spend,” he said.


  “Every dollar needs to be targeted and deliver outcomes rapidly to allow businesses to become more efficient or maintain business activities.


  “We still expect to grow our business considerably though and so we are investing in more capacity and capability to cater for that growth.”

When purchasing a game on Steam, customers have two hours to try it out and, if desired, request a refund. The policy is designed to protect gamers against being stuck with a game that does not run right on their hardware, or simply take a mulligan on a game they did not like. However, some customers have pointed out that two hours is simply not enough time to evaluate Microsoft Flight Simulator, and are asking Valve to extend the refund window.

Mary Eileen Janell   Mar 14, 1943 - Aug 16, 2020 On Sunday, August 16, 2020, the world lost some of its beauty when Mary Eileen Janell (O'Connor) took her last breath, at age 77. She was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother, mentor, and friend. She was born March 14, 1943. She grew up in Waterbury, CT and resided in Woodbury, CT and Naples, FL. She and her husband Joe spent 62 awe-inspiring years loving each other and built a wonderful life together – accomplishing dreams, conquering obstacles, and raising a family – who are their legacy.   Mary graduated from Waterbury Hospital School of Nursing, and then went on to obtain her bachelor's and master's degrees from SCSU. She served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force Nurse Corps at Lackland Air Force Base, worked for 19 years as an OR Nurse at Saint Mary's Hospital, and then worked for almost 25 years at Danbury Hospital as the Director for the School of Surgical Technology before retiring. She changed lives and cared for many, selflessly devoted to helping people.   There are no words that can describe Mary – she was vivacious, fierce, compassionate, brave, soulful, and kind. She loved unconditionally, with every ounce of her heart and soul. She had an innate ability to see the best in people and to help them see it too and gave the best advice. She made countless memories with her family, who she cherished. She took dance classes, and then taught and choreographed dance for years, alongside her daughter, who was also her best friend. She made every second count.   Mary was predeceased by her sons Michael and Joseph and also her grandson Reilly, with whom she is dancing in Heaven. She is survived by her beloved husband Joseph, her loving daughter and son-in-law Amy and John Polmon, her cherished grandchildren Irelynn Janell and Austin and Bailey Polmon, Joe's partner in life Karen Janell, her brother and sister, nieces and nephews, and extended family. She takes a piece of our hearts with her, and is now our guardian angel.   Funeral arrangements are being handled by Munson Lovetere in Southbury. Calling hours will be Thursday, August 20, 2020 from 4-7 p.m. at the funeral home, located 235 Main St. N., Southhbury. Church services will be held outdoors on Friday August 21, 2020 at 11 a.m. directly at St.James Cemetery in Naugatuck, prior to burial. The family asks that you honor Mary by wearing your favorite summer colors, as she preferred brightness in the world. Donations in her honor may be made to Regional Hospice 30 Milestone Rd., Danbury, CT 06810, who cared for her in her final days with tenderness, compassion, and respect.   To leave an online condolence, please visit www.munsonloveterefuneralhome.com.

The U.S. workforce includes about 7.6 million undocumented immigrants. Lack of legal status makes these workers exceptionally vulnerable to exploitation by employers; undocumented workers receive significantly lower wages than citizens or other immigrants with the same job qualifications. Various studies estimate that this "wage penalty" ranges from 6 percent to more than 20 percent. In addition, there are about 250,000 people who work at seasonal jobs (such as harvesting crops or landscaping golf courses) in the United States through the H-2A and H-2B visa programs; these guest workers labor in conditions that the Southern Poverty Law Center calls "close to slavery." A 2011 study suggested that many are being paid from 25 percent to 40 percent less than other workers in similar fields.

It remains to be seen if the same will be true stateside... whenever the Tab S7 duo expands to the "land of the free." In case you're wondering, Samsung was planning to properly release the new flagship tablets in South Korea on September 3, which may or may not be on the cards after this rampant pre-order start.
   
 For the time being, there are no words on the reception of the 5G-enabled Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ versions, both of which are also headed for the US in addition to entry-level Wi-Fi-only configurations.
   
 While it's generally unwise to draw conclusions on the potential global success of a Samsung product based exclusively on its domestic popularity, it's worth highlighting that the Galaxy Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra performed well in the early stages of their Korean pre-order period, failing however to break any records or at least considerably boost the numbers of their forerunners. So, no, not everything that Samsung touches turns to gold in its homeland, which means the Galaxy Tab S7 and S7+ might just be special.
