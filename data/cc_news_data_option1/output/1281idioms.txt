Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh has said that China and its people will stay with Bangladesh in the war against coronavirus.   "We shall stay with Bangladesh in combating the disease and addressing the medical needs," he said in the letter that described the dangers of Covid-19, China's measures to control it, and the need for global cooperation to effectively prevent its transmission and save lives.   At this crucial stage in the fight against the coronavirus, the Embassy of China wishes to express its full confidence in       Bangladesh and the solidarity of the local Chinese community with our Bangladeshi friends.   China, as of now, has donated 40,500 test kits, 15,000 surgical N95 masks, 300,000 medical masks, 10,000 protective gowns and 1,000 infrared thermometers to Bangladesh, the envoy said.   The embassy is also organising a video conference between top Chinese medical experts and Bangladeshi doctors and nurses to provide training and instructions for managing the disease.   "We shall stay with Bangladesh in the implementation of key cooperation projects to make sure that both during and after the epidemic, Bangladeshi workers on the projects will remain employed and the construction will go on as long as the situation permits."   He assured China will stay with Bangladesh in bilateral trade and supply chains to help Bangladesh stabilise its market share and keep local factories up and running to produce critical medical equipment, with the Chinese airlines remaining in operation.   "We from the Embassy of China shall also stay with Bangladesh to continue to provide necessary services and engage in political discourse with the Bangladeshi side as we always do.    "Through solidarity and mutual support, China and Bangladesh will prevail over this outbreak, and together we shall embrace a brighter future for mankind."   "This pandemic threatens the safety of the people of all countries and tests the common wisdom of human society."   "At present, the Covid-19 pandemic is accelerating and spreading across the world, including in Bangladesh where 49 cases have been recorded so far.   He said as of March 29, Covid-19 has spread to over 178 countries and regions with more than 730,000 cases confirmed globally. The grim situation of the pandemic has led many countries to upgrade their response measures.   Li Jiming said after a strenuous struggle and tremendous sacrifices, the situation of pandemic prevention and control in China continues to improve, with the order of production and life being restored at an increasing pace.   China is by no means alone in its fight against the pandemic. The international community has given China valuable support -- leaders of over 170 countries and heads of more than 40 international and regional organizations have either sent messages showing sympathy or issued statements of support for China.   He said they were deeply touched by the people of Bangladesh that firmly stands by the Chinese people in the fight against Covid-19 and recalled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's letter of sympathy and support to Chinese President Xi Jinping.   He also recalled that Bangladesh government and civil societies donated various kinds of medical and health supplies to the Chinese people, while many special prayers were also held for China by Bangladeshi religious circles.   "A friend in need is a friend indeed. The heart-touching actions speak of the long-term and profound friendship between the people of China and Bangladesh."         Li Jiming recalled Chinese President Xi Jinping's statement at the recent G20 Leaders' Summit where he emphasized that it is imperative for the international community to strengthen confidence, act with unity and work together in a collective response so that humanity as one could win the battle against such a major infectious disease.   "In the era of globalisation, all nations are highly interdependent, which makes solidarity and cooperation the most powerful weapon in the fight against this pandemic that endangers humanity as a whole.   "Only by working together to build a community of common health for mankind can we enhance the common well-being of all and safeguard the common future of mankind."   Guided by such a vision, China is more than ready to provide assistance where it can to other countries and contribute to a stable world economy, Li Jiming said.   The Chinese government has donated 20 million dollars to WHO and announced assistance to more than 89 countries in forms of medical supplies and expertise. 7 Chinese medical expert teams have been dispatched to some of the most severely affected countries including Iran, Iraq, Italy, Serbia and so on. Local governments in China and Chinese enterprises and civil organisations have also donated supplies to cities and countries affected.   He said Bangladesh has seen a moderate increase in the number of confirmed cases since early March. Though the Bangladesh government has undertaken a series of resolute, strong and effective measures to curb the disease, there are concerns over how the situation will evolve.

HALIFAX -- A historic Canadian undergarment factory famed for long johns and boxer shorts is about to rapidly reinvent itself as a domestic producer of medical gowns.
 Stanfield's Ltd. of Truro, N.S., is among five firms that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday have received letters of intent to manufacture personal protective equipment and clothing for front-line health workers.
 Jon Stanfield, the chief executive of the fifth-generation family firm, said in an interview he's already sourced approved fabric from nearby Intertape Polymer, and is ready to be producing medical clothing within days.
 The 48-year-old says once the federal government provides details of its offer, the company could bring back over 75 of its over 200 staff who were sent home earlier this month as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 He describes the restart as a "pivotal" signal that Western governments are moving to ensure there are domestic suppliers of medical gear and gowns crucial to public safety in the future.
 Stanfield said the firm has patterns and machinery that would initially produce more than 2,000 gowns daily per shift to help feed a Canadian demand for garments that emerged after the pandemic sliced supply from China.
 The businessman -- the grand nephew of the late federal Tory leader Robert Stanfield -- said he's being driven by a sense of mission akin to the sudden demands created by wars and shifts in the Canadian economy.
 In the 1890s, the company invented shrink-proof heavy woolen underwear used by workers during the Klondike gold rush; in the First World War, the factory was converted to provide wool blankets to keep soldiers warm in the trenches; and in Second World War, it supplied base layers of underclothing.
 Innovation and survival is part of his firm's history, said Stanfield, adding, "my forefathers … invented the long john."
 Stanfield said he plans to provide some gowns through the company's overseas supply chain, but also intends to re-establish a Canadian domestic supply that free trade and offshore production have almost wiped out.
 "Isolation gowns, reusable and disposable, are made in China, so to build a small resource base in Canada is important to dealing with crises like this in the future," he said.
 "You can't have your supply chain be permitted to suddenly fall to zero like this."
 Guillaume Laverdure, the chief operating officer of Montreal-based Medicom, which produces protective masks, said in an interview he also sees a lasting shift occurring.
 His firm has factories in China supplying masks, but the company saw a reduction of supply during the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan.
 Laverdure said in the past few days the supply of masks has been flowing again, but Ottawa has signed an agreement with his company to create a Canadian-based factory and supply face masks to health agencies.
 Laverdure said several Western governments his firm is dealing with, including France and Canada, are now looking for his company to produce the mask on their soil.
 "They want to have control of such a critical item for their health-care system," he said in an interview.
 Stanfield said he hasn't been informed yet how large a contract is going to be offered to gown producers under the federal procurement program, but he expects it will be in the millions of dollars.
 He expects the details will be worked out and emerge in the days to come.
 "We're … going to be supporting our people in the front-line defence against COVID-19 with creativity and innovation," he said.

For many Pratt and surrounding-area residents, Sunday evening's Cruise Night down Main and First streets in Pratt was a chance to take a deep breath, let off a little steam, de-stress and just have fun waving at friends and neighbors. An undetermined number of people were in an estimated 250 vehicles, out dragging the streets of Pratt as they enjoyed the street sounds of car motors revving, horns honking, friends shouting and tunes playing on radios.
   
 "It was just great to have a chance to get out and enjoy ourselves," said Kelsey Polok, who was cruising with her daughter Oakley in grandpa Dale Wither's '61 Corvair. "We've all been so tense about this coronavirus thing, it was awesome to get out and enjoy the evening with friends, even though we couldn't get close to them."
   
 Pratt's Cruise Night 2020, from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., included several added features, like a food drive, song requests and name that tune contests with KMMM AM 1290, curbside popcorn from the Barron Theater, call-ahead drinks at Simply Southwest, discounted Waky Pack meals at Sonic and Pratt Area Chamber of Commerce Chamber Bucks prizes.
   
 "We really had only one rule, stay inside your car and enjoy the cruise," said event organizer Yadira Garcia-Pedroza.
   
 Pedroza, along with Linda Broce who helped coordinate the Gamma Beta food drive, said the event was successful beyond expectations.
   
 "It seemed like people really enjoyed it and were glad to get out of the house and do something 'together' in a unique way," Broce said.
   
 Gamma Beta ladies were stationed curbside in front of Hello Beautiful, where they accepted more than 160 canned goods and non-perishable food items, in gloved hands, from cruisers as they went by. The food items will be donated to the Pratt County Food Bank.
   
 "The whole event was just amazing," Pedroza said. "The turnout was better than I expected, just all-in-all pretty exciting. We are not used to not being able to go out and do what we want, not getting together, so this event was just very special. It gave people hope that as a community, we will pull through this thing."
   
 Pedroza said the idea to have a Pratt Cruise Night was mentioned on her Facebook group Pratt Neighbors Helping Neighbors, and it just took off from there.
   
 "I asked for ideas and people just kept coming up with more and more great ideas. It really just took off, and I was so happy for all the support we got from different people and businesses in the community," she said.
   
 When Kansas Governor Laura Kelly issued a stay-at-home statement concerning the spread of the coronavirus in the state, the day before the planned cruise night, many had questions about whether continuing the event as planned was a good idea.
   
 "We had some changes that were understandable," Pedroza said. "Above all, we just wanted to people to be safe. In the end it all worked out just great."
   
 Pedroza said she felt like crying because of the way the community came together in support of each other during this trying time.
   
 "The support of the city fire department just filled my heart," she said. "And when I saw teacher Crystal Newby (USD 382 preschool) out there parked on the side, with posters telling her kids she missed them, that was special."
   
 Pedroza said that many were wondering if there would be another Pratt Cruise Night in the future.
   
 "We will have to wait until after April 19, but I'm sure we are all going to be tired of being cooped up in quarantine after 30 days," she said. "Maybe we can feature other businesses next time and find more ways to help our small businesses. This first event just showed how our community can come together. It was an awesome feeling."
   
 Pedroza credited her Facebook group friends and Anel Cox with helping organize and get the word out about the March 29 cruise event. The prescribed route started at Ampride on South Main Street, went to the 4-way stop light, turned right on First Street, went to a loop around Sonic, back up First Street to the 4-way stop, turned right on North Main to a turnaround at the Pratt Community Center, then back on North Main and continued through the 4-way stop, down South Main Street to Ampride again.

Within “a year or two, the cost [of] buying an EV will start to get cheaper than a similar internal combustion engine [ICE] car,” and at that point, people “will simply vote with their wallets,” Jouret said. Refuting some projections that EV adoption will be stymied by battery lifetimes, he added, “We think that some of the initial doom and gloom around battery life is over and done,” noting that more companies are introducing effective efforts to help consumers manage battery degradation.

Analysis of previous research, which also finds a connection between a long workweek and developing high blood pressure, suggests stress and loss of sleep as potential causes. But because the number-crunching in the Canadian study takes those factors into consideration, the authors suspect some other mechanism is at work. Considering that the study looked at white-collar workers, who spend the lion's share of their time behind a desk, recent revelations about the adverse health effects of prolonged sitting may hold a clue. These include weight gain, increased risk of developing metabolic diseases like Type 2 diabetes, and, yes, hypertension. It will be interesting to see if these parallel avenues of research converge.

A small, mobile blackboard on Turkey Shore Road says, "BREAD," along with some handwritten notes below, but it's the "BREAD" that catches the eye.
 Fresh bread in oval loaves that breaks up at the hard, crunchy crust and gives way to a tender inside.
 But the loaf is more than bread, more than sustenance.
 "It's a labor of love," said baker Jess Wagoner. "It takes a long time to do. Bread is the ultimate community builder. It's given me a purpose in this time. More than I could do than if I just pulled the covers up over my head. Baking bread is about connecting with people."
 Wagoner makes a French-style, sourdough bread, although the specific mix of whole grain wheat, natural white flour, water and natural yeast is her own recipe. The sourdough means she must feed the starter a mix of water and flour. The wild yeast to leaven the bread comes from the air.
 "I started six years ago. I feed it twice a day. It's like a child," Wagoner said.
 Wagoner makes 12 loaves each morning and provides them at a suggested donation of $5 each from her Turkey Shore home -- she has ServSafe certification -- between 10 a.m. and noon each day and takes orders at her website grainiacsunite.com.
 The sourdough bread can last about a week, longer if it's frozen and Wagoner said she will slice, put the bread in a paper bag and also freeze it.
 Wagoner will fulfill orders for those who cannot afford the $5 donation she suggests.
 Customers must place orders two days in advance of pick up.
 Wagoner has been baking bread for over 10 years and taught bread-baking classes at Appleton Farms before the Trustees closed all its properties throughout the commonwealth to slow the spread of COVID-19.
 The sourdough bread Wagoner makes uses locally sourced, natural ingredients. The whole wheat grain comes from Alprilla Farm in Essex and the white flour comes from King Arthur in Vermont.
 "People are going back to whole grains and local farms." Wagoner said. "I think that's really important. The wheat from Aprilla is a hard red winter wheat that helps to nourish the soil.   The grain comes as local as I can get. I want to support the little guy because I'm the little guy."
 Wagoner grinds the Alprilla flour on her tabletop mill in her kitchen and then mixes the dough. The whole process can take 24 hours. Some sourdough bread processes can take as little as eight hours, Wagoner said.
 "The longer period helps with digestibility and makes the grain nutrition available in your gut," Wagoner said.
 Eventually, Wagoner hopes to expand beyond her kitchen and beyond baking sourdough bread.
 "When I get my cottage food license or open my own establishment, I'd Like to do more with other types of whole grain, local breads. And local fruit preserves," Wagoner said. " I would also like to do some sweeter things with hand pies. Right now, I'm just baking through the quarantine and giving myself something to do."

That’s not to suggest that Massie wouldn’t endorse Trump, but libertarians and independents who admire Massie might vote Libertarian Party or sit out 2020. It’s not on the same scale as Sen.

Fernandes has settled in quickly at Old Trafford
 When Bruno Fernandes lifted his finger to his lips to 'shush' Pep Guardiola at Old Trafford, he became an instant hero for Manchester United supporters.
 The Portuguese midfielder has made an immediate impact both on and off the pitch for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side, who are unbeaten since his arrival from Sporting Lisbon for £47m in the January transfer window.
 Despite playing just nine games and seeing big name players such as Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria and Alexis Sanchez fail to make an impression before him, Fernandes has already been touted as the club's best signing since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013.

"It became an annual run and eventually became a 10K. It was run for 27 years and was the oldest continuous road race in Kentucky until it had to be stopped because increased traffic made it dangerous, especially over the bridge into Burnside."
 In 1985, Wilhelm participated in his first and only marathon - the prestigious Boston Marathon. The 26.2-mile race is on every runner's bucket list, but to run at Boston, one must meet a qualifying time. Wilhelm, along with his friend Dr. Steve Rose, was able to do just that in the mid-1980s.
 "Running the Boston Marathon is quite an experience," told Wilhelm. "Until this year when it was rescheduled because of the coronavirus, it was always run on the third Monday in April, which is Patriots Day, a holiday in Massachusetts celebrating an American Revolution battle near Boston. There are crowds of people all along the way cheering you on. There were about 6,000 runners that year. Last year, there were 30,000. I never ran another marathon after that because I knew I could never top Boston."
 In the early 1990s, Wilhelm experienced some difficulty breathing on an early morning run. It turned out to be a blocked artery, so by-pass surgery was required to fix the issue.
 Running was put on hold for a small time frame, but after two months, Wilhelm was back in his natural element on the road. After struggling to even walk across his household after his surgery, he was back to running three miles per day. Wilhelm even posted a ten-mile run less than three months after his by- pass surgery.
 "During recovery at home, I could hardly walk from one room to the next," stated Wilhelm. "That was discouraging and depressing. But after I began to walk outside and then run, in about two months, I was able to run three miles."
 Wilhelm, who used to run in the hot, cold, rain, and snow, still runs outside, but only if the weather is nice. When the weather isn't pleasant, he goes to a local gym to run. Due to the recent coronavirus outbreak, Wilhelm has used the inside of his home to get his daily mileage in.
 "These days I don't get out in bad weather," explained the 89-year old. "I had been running around the gym at the former YMCA until it closed because of the coronavirus. I don't like running on a treadmill so I would run around the gym for 45 minutes three days a week and work out on the weight machines for two days. I run and work out for my health more than anything, and I am not as addicted. Now, until it stops raining and turns warmer, I am limited to walking up and downstairs."
 Last month, Wilhelm crossed the finish line in the eighth annual Shamrock Shuffle. When he runs the 3.1-mile race next spring in 2021, he wants to be about ten pounds lighter.
 "I have run every Shamrock Shuffle except one when I had bronchitis," Wilhelm began. "I plan to run the Shamrock Shuffle next year when I am 90. But I need to lose about ten pounds and train a little harder, so it will look more like I am running than shuffling."

But gubernatorial press aide Patrick Ptak noted that Brnovich, in his opinion, said that local declarations “shall not be inconsistent with orders, rules and regulations promulgated by the governor.’’
 “The law is clear,’’ he said. “The state’s guidance supersedes other directives.’’
 Ducey has insisted all along that he believes his order trumps any local orders. And his executive order specifically considers hair salons, nail salons and barbers to be “essential services’’ which cities cannot order shuttered.
 Yet Evans has not backed away from her own proclamation which has ordered those businesses closed. And the governor has yet to take any legal action against either Evans or Flagstaff to have her proclamation declared void.
 Boyer said he asked for the legal opinion not to help cities but because he has gotten questions from business owners following the governor’s Monday “stay at home’’ order. That order directs Arizona residents to “limit their time away from their place of residence or property’’ to participate in “essential activities’’ or to work or use the services of “essential businesses.’’
 The senator said the people who approached him wanted to know what would happen if they continued to do certain kinds of work and whether they could be cited by local law enforcement.
 Brnovich’s answer is clearly “yes.’’
 He pointed out that state law says any person who “knowingly fails or refuses to obey any lawful order or regulation’’ issued under emergency powers given to local officials is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. That carries a penalty of up to six months in the county jail and a $2,500 fine.
 But Brnovich cautioned that police and deputies must take into consideration “the constitutional and statutory liberties that Arizonans enjoy,’’ even in declared emergencies.
 For example, he noted, Arizona law allows state and local health officials to issue quarantine or isolation orders. But Brnovich pointed out that the law requires these to be implemented “by the least restrictive means necessary to protect public health’’ and that someone’s home may be an acceptable place of quarantine.
 “Established court precedents in various contexts demonstrate the careful balance that must be struck in protecting public health while respecting individual rights,’’ Brnovich wrote.
 Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier said deputies will not be setting up checkpoints or pulling people over to make arrests but instead seek to educate people about what the law allows.
 “It’s not the intent to see how many people we can arrest,” Napier said in a statement on Facebook Live on Monday. He said that arrests would be reserved for cases “of egregious violators and people thumbing their nose’’ at restrictions.

All carts are sanitized after they’re used, with particular attention paid to steering wheels and seats. Coolers and sand/seed bottles have been removed from the carts, anything to limit touch points.
 “All the courses are doing things like leaving the flagstick in,” Nolen said. “We’ve put an insert into the cup so the ball doesn’t go all the way down so it’s easy to take out without touching a lot of things.”
 Traffic is slightly down, Nolen said, but March and early April aren’t normally busy times for the club.
 Redlands Mesa Golf Club is also open and using stringent cleaning and sanitizing procedures, and is asking players not to linger in the pro shop and to keep their distance from one another. Walking the course, which ranges from 4,790 yards from the Desert tees to 7,007 yards from the Monument tees, is anything but a leisurely stroll, so carts are allowed, but are returned to the cart barn to be sanitized after every use.

SYDNEY -- Australia is pushing foreign-flagged cruise ships to leave its territorial waters amid the coronavirus pandemic, walking a diplomatic tightrope as it also tries to bring home citizens trapped on ships abroad.
 Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan on Wednesday called on the federal government to kick out the German-owned MV Artania after the crew was reported to have asked the Australian Border Force (ABF) for permission to stay until April 14.
 "If what's required is to clean the ship as a condition of getting it underway, well then do that … but get the ship away from Western Australia as soon as possible," WA Premier Mark McGowan told reporters, adding there were six to nine other ships off Sydney.
 Cruise ships are responsible for at least 20% of Australia's 4,800 coronavirus cases nationally, and the source of public anger after passengers from Carnival Corp's Ruby Princess were allowed to disembark in Sydney and several later tested positive for COVID-19.
 In the wake of that incident and amid fears cruise ships were essentially super carriers of the virus, the federal government barred them from docking at Australian port, except in emergencies.
 The Artania was permitted to dock last week to allow for the evacuation of nine people suspected to have the virus. Several hundred passengers were offloaded and flown back to Germany over the weekend, leaving around 450 crew members and a couple of dozen passengers on board.
 "The Commonwealth is continuing to work with the W.A. state government to ensure that Artania has the ability to depart Australian waters as soon as reasonably practicable," the Department of Home Affairs said in an emailed statement.
 Germany's Phoenix Reisen, owner of the Artania, was not immediately available for comment.
 Foreign Minister Marise Payne acknowledged that asking ships to leave Australian waters while at the same time trying to bring citizens home from ships docked in foreign waters was a "very difficult balancing process."
 Payne said there were 600 Australians trapped on 10 cruise ships around the world.
 "We have to protect Australians," Payne told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. "We have to protect and support Australians overseas as well and get them home in a way that is safe for them and safe for Australians here."
 BONDI CLINIC
 The rate of growth in new infections across Australia has slowed to just under 10% in recent days, from 25-30% a week ago. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said on Wednesday "the curve is flattening" but it was "not time to take the foot off the brake." The country's death toll stands at 20 after a steady creep upward in recent days.
 Authorities opened up clinics in virus hotspots around the country, including at Bondi Beach, on Wednesday as they zeroed in on specific areas that have reported clusters of infections. Bondi made headlines in March when thousands of people were seen ignoring social distancing rules at its world-famous beach.
 Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stressed the need for continuing strict social distancing measures despite the slowdown, including restricting the number of people meeting in public to just two and the closure of parks, beaches and gyms.
 The Reserve Bank of Australia on Wednesday said the country's A$2 trillion ($1.23 trillion) economy would likely experience a "very material contraction" in economic activity that could spread beyond the June quarter. The RBA held an out-of-cycle meeting on March 18 when it reduced its cash rate to a record low 0.25% and embarked on a bond buying program to try and shield the economy from the devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
 The government and RBA have announced stimulus packages worth up to A$320 billion, excluding quantitative easing. (Reporting by Sonali Paul and Colin Packham; editing by Jane Wardell)

Palantir, which was last valued at $20 billion and  counts Peter Thiel and the CIA among its investors, has a checkered history. The company operates under the radar and has come under fire from immigrant rights groups for its work helping Immigrations and Customs Enforcement track and deport immigrants. In late 2019, it took up a military contract with the Pentagon previously abandoned by Google after employees protested it was unethical.

More and more, local governments are trying to hold meetings without the public in the name of social distancing. The reasons are understandable. Public meetings, like all gatherings, are simply a bad idea right now. And yet, the business of government must go on.
 That has left agencies large and small trying to answer the question of how their boards and councils can legally meet while limiting public access. In most cases, it has meant making use of technology to offer live video streams for the public to follow at home. The efforts have been more miss than hit, with the Lake Havasu Unified School District’s attempt last week a notable example. The district had its board meet as normal, but locked the doors to the public, directing them to watch along as the meeting streamed on Facebook. Members of the public could ask questions using Facebook’s commenting features, and the district officials would attempt to address those throughout the meeting. Had it worked, it would have been a good compromise in the face of all this uncertainty. But it didn’t work — the meeting lagged, the public couldn’t view the meeting in real time, much less participate. It’s nice that the school district was attempting to do the right thing, but at the end of the day, the public was excluded from participation, and that should be a red flag for all of us.
 To be clear, the technology issues are probably Facebook’s fault, not the school district’s, but if this is the direction things are going, then we need to make sure the technology is adequate.

When that all happens is up in the air at the moment as rugby, like other sports across the country, attempts to work its way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.
 When there is a return to anything like normality, Murphy says he is looking forward to helping Tigers move forward with Borthwick adding his qualities to the coaching mix.
 "It is a relationship we need to grow and develop," Murphy said. "From my conversations so far with Steve, I'm very excited about it.
 "We addressed a year ago that we needed a high-quality coach to come in and help the forwards and oversee everything in regards to rugby.
 " That's what Steve does with England. I've been very lucky to to go down there and watch him. The way he leads sessions and the way he clicks sessions together and implements his rugby programme is massively exciting.
 "I think we have great coaches here but that is going to add to it."
