One of the blights of building a security practice is getting all of your technologies to integrate together and feed information to each other. When you add the fact that each technology has its own user interface (UI) and management console, it can very quickly become overwhelming for the end user to keep tabs on each console, learn every interface and complicates building a workflow in the case of incidents or investigations. The administrators who manage the system also have to update each component individually, ensure that the integrations don't break when an update is delivered and ensure that any new technologies don't cause an existing piece of your solution to fail.

If you ask any customer what the biggest negative is when it comes to new and emerging technologies, you'll get a pretty rapid answer of "vendor lock-in." You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't give a customer the opportunity to build multiple, "best-of-breed" products into a comprehensive strategy, you're going to fall by the wayside pretty quickly.
