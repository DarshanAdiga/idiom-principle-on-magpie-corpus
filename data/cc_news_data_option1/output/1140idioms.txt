Before statehood our neighborhood was part of the Great Osage Nation. It took nearly 20 years after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 for Missouri to gain enough population to apply for statehood, which finally took place in 1821. However, a 26-mile wide strip, where we live today, between Fort Osage and the Kansas border, was held onto by the Osage and was not open for American settlement until 1825. As the papers were being signed in 1825 between the Great Osage and the U.S. government at Fort Osage, there were as many as 50 wagons of American settlers awaiting permission to move in and stake a land claim.
   
 One of the first official acts of the state of Missouri was to designate our neighborhood as Jackson County, in honor of the popular General Andrew Jackson. Then, one of the first acts of the new county was to locate a county seat and then issue a contract for the construction of a courthouse.
   
 They figured it would take a while to construct a new brick courthouse on the Independence Square, so in order to conduct county business immediately, they issued a $150 contract to build a log cabin courthouse to be built one block east of the Square.
   
 They proceeded to cut a number of black walnut trees from around the Square and Sam Shepard, a slave, was chosen to hew the logs and construct the temporary courthouse. He did such a good job that the structure still stands to this day.
   
 Built as a temporary courthouse, the log building ceased county operations in 1831 upon the completion of the permanent brick facility on the Independence Square. The following year, the log courthouse was purchased by Algenon Sidney Gilbert, an agent for the Mormon Church, who used it as his home and a store to assist relocating members. Mr. Gilbert's store became a central focus of the Mormons' rapid development as a successful commerce community. Gilbert and his family were driven from the store just two years later following attacks on the building by area ruffians who wanted to rid the county of these religious newcomers.
   
 You would be fascinated by the history that fills this rudimentary structure, which for four years served as the last courthouse between Independence and the Pacific Ocean. If walls could talk, we'd be astonished at what these well- worn logs could tell us, including the story of an angel who visited the courthouse in 1834.
   
 It was the region's seat of justice in the beginning of the Santa Fe Trail trade and later served as a saddle shop, church, a Mormon mercantile, "house of entertainment," residence, and home to the Community Welfare League. Now the Log Cabin Courthouse stands as a tribute to the founding and development of Independence.
   
 Roots of Harry and Bess Truman can even be traced to the Log Courthouse. Bess chaired a 1920s fundraising and restoration effort for the historic building. As a result, the log structure was restored and was relocated to its current location. When Harry Truman was Eastern Jackson County judge he held court in the log structure in the 1930s while the present-day brick courthouse on the Square was being remodeled.
   
 While walking early one morning with Mr. Truman, he told me that my uncles, Herb and Tom Noland, owned a Studebaker agency one block south of the old log courthouse and during the time he was at the log building, he spent his lunch hour down at the dealership playing poker with those two.
   
 Today, the historic Log Cabin Courthouse stands at 107 W. Kansas Ave., one block south of the Square and is open free to the public at times with a guided tour.

But it's not healthy to fixate, even as it's easier than ever before, with a seemingly endless supply of data right there on our screens. Here in the newsroom the COVID-19 updates have come in thick and fast this week, and we've worked tirelessly to try to keep on top of the closures, cancellations and shifting landscape. But it's important to take a break, too. Even for reporters. We need to at least occasionally remind ourselves that COVID-19 isn't the only thing going on in the world, and that this, too, shall pass.

The Utah Supreme Court and Utah Judicial Council issued an administrative order on Saturday that, among other things, instructs district court and justice court judges to suspend all civil and criminal jury trials until after June 1.
 The order, signed by Matthew Durrant, chief justice of the Utah Supreme Court and presiding officer of the judicial council, cites recent announcements by the World Health Organization and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert about the severity and spread of the new coronavirus as justification for the changes.
 “To protect the public and all court participants it has become necessary for the Utah Judiciary to implement its Pandemic Response Plan … (to) bring uniformity to the operation of the courts during the COVID-19 pandemic,” the order reads.
 The order identifies “mission-critical functions of the judiciary at each court level.” In many cases, hearings are allowed to continue, albeit via remote transmission such as telephone or video conferencing.
 Among the directives to judicial workers, the order states that all courthouses are to remain open during regular business hours “in a manner necessary to effectuate the mission of the courts,” including being accessible by telephone or online; courts will continue to accept filings, electronically or by email; and anyone who comes to a courthouse in response to a summons or a promise to appear will be given a new court date.
 Appellate courts have been given authority to determine which cases to set for oral argument, with preference toward cases involving child custody, juvenile detention, child welfare adjudications and dispositions, and other hearings involving child safety, in-custody defendants and election matters.
 All juvenile court hearings will be continued until after June 1, with the exception of shelter hearings, child welfare adjudication and disposition hearings, detention hearings, in-custody delinquency adjudication and disposition hearings, detention reviews, protective orders and other hearings involving a child at risk of abuse, neglect or dependency.
 Furthermore, justice court hearings in cases involving defendants not in custody who are charged with lesser traffic violations — not reckless driving or driving under the influence — are continued until after Oct. 1.
 Judges assigned to the cases of defendants currently in custody on class B or C misdemeanor offenses may reconsider their custody status and are encouraged to release the defendant “subject to appropriate conditions.”
 The order ends with a warning to justice courts that fail to adhere to the instructions will be subject to decertification by the judicial council.

Every year around this time K&J Greenhouse in Columbus Grove is typically busy with customers constantly putting in orders for their annual Easter lilies and hydrangeas.


  But this year things have changed. Many of the business's plants and flowers are sold to churches and with them closing down due to the concerns around the spread of Covid-19, sales have been declining.


  “What orders in many cases we had have been cancelled and other cases orders are not even being placed,” said Ken Wright, K&J Greenhouse owner. “We grow about 7,000 plants here for Easter and unless something changes we fully expect to dump about 80 percent of that crop.”


  But despite this big loss, there's still work to be done. Wright has actually hired on some extra help to finish up things on the production side.


  “We need to get as many of those things done as quickly as possible for fear of my employees having to stay home because if that happens we have this whole place to run with my wife and I and it would be an impossible task,” said Wright.


  In the 42 years of being in business, wright says he has never experienced anything like this. If things don't change within in the next couple of months, he believes it could potentially damage his and other area businesses.


  “If the markets aren’t back to normal through the normal channels by late April or by May 1st there could be some serious losses to my fellow growers as well in the area,” he said.

In Chitungwiza, a town of half-a-million people south of Harare, several women are waiting at the water pump with large cans, concern etched on their faces, fearful of the growing threat of the coronavirus.


  "We can go for months without running water," said one woman, especially worried after the confirmation of the first two cases of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe, a country that is already teetering on the edge of an economic abyss.


  "I doubt that we are prepared as a country to mitigate or to respond to this deadly coronavirus," said George Mangava, another local.


  "As a Chitungwiza resident our main concern is running water," he added.


  The lack of water has multiple effects, primarily on diet and hygiene.


  Since the COVID-19 outbreak began in China at the end of last year the worldwide mantra has been to "wash your hands" thoroughly and often to avoid contracting or spreading the virus.


  But in Zimbabwe, a southern African country on its knees after two decades of economic misrule, basic infrastructures are failing and health services are all but extinct.


  "If we go to the local clinic you hardly find the most basic drug Paracetamol," Mangava complained.


  His pessimism is shared by those at the top of the medical profession.


  "Unfortunately, the system itself is overstretched and inadequate to deal with a coronavirus epidemic," warned Norman Matara, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights in January.


  On Friday, Zimbabwe announced its first COVID-19 case at Victoria Falls, a resort town. That was followed on Saturday by news of the first case in the capital Harare.


  "I just don't know how we will survive if this disease attacks us if the shops and markets are closed," said Nettie Moyo, a Chitungwiza resident. "Life is difficult these days. There's no money. How are we going to feed our children?"


  \- 'Drop like flies' -


  That fear is shared by Moyo's fellow villagers.


  "We are not prepared at all because we're not even aware of how the disease is spread," said her neighbour Muzvare Kawocha.


  "There has been no door-to-door information dissemination on the disease. Some of us have no televisions so we rely on hearsay for information about the disease."


  Nkululeko Sibanda, one of the spokesmen of the largest opposition the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), called for a lockdown to contain the spread, warning that if the virus reaches the country's crowded petrol and bus queues, "we will drop like flies".


  At Chitungwiza municipality, town clerk Tonderai Kasu, another doctor, insists that his teams have been busily educating the populace about the virus.


  "We are doing surveillance and monitoring in the community and we are also doing awareness activities.


  "If we get any suspected cases in Chitungwiza, the procedure is to have an ambulance ferry them to Wilkins Hospital in Harare," he explained.


  The problem with that plan is that there are only two ambulances at their disposal and they are both very old.


  To combat the spread of the virus, Zimbabwe president Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a state of emergency this week, announcing the closure of all schools.


  "With AIDS running at 14 percent and cases of malnutrition, we are very worried," he said.


  With the menace growing, he banned members of his government from travelling.


  "I will only go out when it is necessary, inevitable," said Mnangagwa.


  But the president appeared to be sending out mixed messages when several days later he flew to Namibia for Saturday's swearing-in ceremony of Namibian president Hage Geingob in Windhoek.

2015 was the lowest year in the data set for total drug buys with 67, though the agency spent just over $22,000. The next year, 2016, the drug strike force increased its spending on drug buys by more than $23,000 to $45,740.


  "When you move a little higher in the food chain, what you're going to see is you're buying larger amounts of the drug and so the price is going to go up," Collie said. "When you're talking $80 a pill, even $40 a pill, if you're buying, you know, so many pills, then you're going to spend more money."


  Then, in both 2017 and 2018, the agency reduced its spending on drug buys to $30,200, and $36,000, respectively.


  The latest figure shows confidential informants spent $40,000 on 127 drug buys on behalf of the Strike Force in 2019.


  Collie said his agency does use undercover officers to conduct drug buys when possible, but the tactic isn't always effective in Northwest Missouri.


  "That may work really easy in the bigger cities where you get into larger populations," he said. "The bad thing is for the areas we cover in Northwest Missouri, just having that person show up out of the blue isn't something we do."


  In addition, Collie said the strike force does not generally use people who are accused or convicted of crimes that caused harm to people as confidential informants.


  He confirmed some informants do get paid, and the amount usually starts at about $100 per deal. Other informants are not paid, and Collie said his agency often informs local prosecutors of informants' help in cases in exchange for their cooperation.

FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Spring training returned right on time in mid-February. The Boys of Summer were back in town.
   
 Aahhh, the familiar smell of popcorn and hot dogs wafted through the grandstands. Fans enjoyed some Buds with their buds and talked about their favorite players. Relaxed Red Sox players signed autographs and chatted with fans.
   
 All that changed on March 12. That's the day the commissioner shut down our National Pastime. Current score: coronavirus 1, baseball 0.
   
 Here in Fort Myers and from Tampa to Tempe, there is crying in baseball. The gates were locked and the players were told to go home. Those same stands at JetBlue Park are now empty and aroma free. It's a dark day in Florida and Arizona.
   
 Players were told they could stick around and use the Sox training facilities. A day later, though, Major League Baseball switched gears and told most players to go home.
   
 JetBlue Park was suddenly a ghost town. It's March. There's supposed to be the crack of the bat, not dead silence!
   
 Every February and March since 1993, when the Red Sox moved to Fort Myers from Winter Haven, thousands of New Englanders have come here to watch their heroes. Many bought homes here -- Florida is a tax friendly state and has no state income tax.
   
 Snowbirds fly or drive to Lee County, which is halfway between Tampa and Miami on Florida's west coast. It's a place where nearly 700,000 people make their homes. About a quarter of a million of them are part-timers who escape the snow and ice for a few months.
   
 It used to be you would rarely see a license plate from Massachusetts or Rhode Island or Maine, etc. When I first came here in 1987, most of the out-of-state plates were from Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Not anymore.
   
 The Red Sox are one of the most popular teams in Florida. Since moving to JetBlue in 2012, they have sold out every game -- 135 in a row. Incredibly, since coming to Fort Myers in 1993, it's been standing room only in all but one of the 249 home Grapefruit League games. They played for 18 years at City of Palms Park near downtown before moving 10 miles southeast into the new ballpark that was patterned after Fenway.
   
 For a time it appeared that major league players might return to their spring training sites. Originally, MLB said there would be a two-week delay to opening the season. A few days later a new start date was announced -- the second week of May. Realistically, no one has a clue when baseball will resume.
   
 Spring training is a significant financial boost for Florida and Arizona. Each year fans head south and west, bringing fat wallets and families in tow. A recent study showed that baseball visitors to Fort Myers alone spent nearly $70 million on their spring training visits. In the survey, of nearly 1,200 of those questioned, 50 percent said their primary reason coming to Fort Myers was for spring training.
   
 In other words, this area is taking a big financial hit since about half of the Grapefruit League schedule was canceled. People checked out early from their hotels, heading back to Pawtucket and Worcester and Hanover and all other parts of New England. Also gone from the area's economy are meals eaten at restaurants, beers guzzled in pubs and all the other places vacationers spend their money.
   
 Fort Myers is the most unique spring training city in baseball. There are actually four major league spring training parks here. The newest is JetBlue.
   
 There is Hammond Stadium, about five miles west of JetBlue and home of the Minnesota Twins, who came to town in 1991. City of Palms was built for the Red Sox and opened in 1993. Today, it's home to Florida Southwestern College's baseball team.
   
 And there is Terry Park on the east side of town. Built in the early 1920s, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics trained there beginning in 1925. The Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals also trained there. This spring, a Korean Baseball League team used the ballpark.
   
 On the flip side of this national emergency, baseball fans have endured strikes, a canceled World Series, the Black Sox, cheating scandal, great teams, lousy teams.
   
 Baseball will be back this year this (we hope), but probably not here at JetBlue Park.

The SARS-CoV-2/COVID19 pandemic will have huge political repercussions worldwide because in this specific case, not only will the AngloZionist propaganda machine not be able to hide the truth from the people (if anything, all sorts of fake news and crazy rumors will have more “street cred” than what the politicians tell us), but the consequences of this crisis will be felt everywhere, including at home. So Trump can go on in each of his pressers about how everything in the USA is “the best”, “the greatest” and “the mightiest”, but the truth is that the this virus will reveal not only the total inability of the private sector to save the day, it will also reveal how utterly dysfunctional the US, along most other western states really are (no, Walmart and Amazon will not save the day). No wonder the western politicians are scrambling to show how “involved” they all are – they are simply trying to cover their rear end for the inevitable “lessons learned” moment coming for all. Maybe at some point in the future will see most US Americans reconsider what they think they know about Socialism and Libertarianism, especially when it becomes clear how different the reaction to the virus was in China and Russia compared to the EU or US.

 Nor your health. The coronavirus 2019, COVID-19 has everybody redesigning their daily lives. Perfume factories and distilleries are now producing hand sanitizers. Restaurants, bars, theaters and other places are temporarily being closed to combat this nightmarish virus war that may well destroy0 our economy. This microbe attack won't be the first or the last.
 The reservoir for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (this virus) are bats. The bats were affected by people cutting down way too many trees (your friends, remember) which drove the bats into villages. None of us are getting out of this life alive, but hope to stick around as long as possible. Might as well bone up on all precautions.
 There have been nine flu pandemics the last 300 years and four within the past 100 years. This is the first novel coronavirus pandemic. The Black Plague (mid 1300's) was carried by fleas on rodents in Asia. The climate changed to much drier conditions which drove the parasite-ridden rodents into human populations and the rest is history.
 The deadly pandemic flu event of 1918 infected 500 million people worldwide, about a third of the population. Fifty to 100 million people died (at least 10% of those infected). Genes of avian origin were identified as the cause for this influenza type A subtype H1N1 virus. The virulent strain cropped up simultaneously in France, Austria, China and even Ft. Riley, Kansas. To keep up morale during World War I, reports of the flu were downplayed except in neutral Spain. Here the flu was reported to be particularly vicious, the reason the flu was labeled 'Spanish flu.'
 With large troop movements, sizeable numbers of soldiers housed together in camps, the fighting done from dirty wet trenches and malnutrition, the virus spread and mutated rapidly in three waves. The target age was young adults between 20-40 years. The virus struck the immune system, which over-reacted by attacking the lungs and causing pneumonia.
 The swine flu pandemic (2009-2010) was linked to swine and avian viruses that jumped into populations working closely with animals. It spread rapidly, mainly infecting people under 65, not above 65. This flu pandemic killed about 500 thousand the first year. The current annual flu shot has a swine flu component in its mixture. Despite the availability of the vaccine, 300,000-650,000 deaths each year occur from seasonal flu.
 My great uncle never made it overseas during World War I. He was 18, in basic training, became sick, and died from pneumonia. The family story says he came home, walked over to his mother who was sitting in a chair, crumpled to his knees, laid his head in her lap and died.
 The graveyard in southeast Oklahoma was visited on St. Pat's Day. Here my dad's grandparents and two of their sons are buried. My uncle in town was treated to corned beef and go-withs. Afterward, a trip was made to Ellis Chapel to find the tombstone of my unlucky soldier relative. An old redcedar guarded the graves. Looking closely at the inscription, it seems my great uncle, who supposedly died in 1918, actually died in 1891. Unless he got sick during an Oklahoma land run or fought in the Chilean War of 1891, the legend has a few holes in it. The secret went with him to the grave. Great story though.
 My mom's mother (of the Dempsey clan) was prone to slight exaggerations and wonderful tales of lore. Her stories were famous, especially about ghosts. We were never sure where she was born since it kept changing. I tracked our relative 'Lord' Richard Cullen to the U.K. The lord was a greengrocer with several young children buried in Lynsgate Cemetery. The only inscriptions on the stone were a list of their names and an explanation that the oldest, one10 year old, had been killed by a falling girder! Other kids lived to adulthood, but my Cullen was the only one to emigrate to the United States. I am still searching for that lost royalty!
 My Dempsey ancestor was an orphan. He may have lost his family before or during the grueling trip. The cramped and crowded famine ships, often called coffin ships, carried the Irish to North America during the late 1840s to 1860. The mortality rate was very high. Diseases were rampant. There was one single fire pit on the top level where all jockeyed to cook meals.
 After arriving in Canada or the US, the Irish seem to separate themselves into two classes: shanty and lace curtain. My grandmother was proud she came from 'Lace Curtain Irish.' Shanty were rough Irish with large families living in one room cabins. Lace curtains were more refined and could afford something nicer to cover the windows. They began to attend the better schools. Resentment built. Lace curtains were thought to curry the favor of the White Anglo Saxon Protestants in the area. They worked hard to climb out of poverty as sure as tree branches reach up to the sky.
 We were very Irish this past week. St. Pat's day was celebrated twice. On Sunday corned beef simmered for hours in spicy water before the carrots and potatoes were added. Last into the pot came the cabbage. Soda bread had been baked and was eagerly waiting for butter. Friend and Rocco dog arrived in an SUV. My son chose to ride his bicycle along old Route 66 from Tulsa to Chandler and continue on to our house. Along the way he explored Sapulpa, bumped on bricks in Davenport and rolled past the Chandler armory. We soon gathered around the loaded table and ate to Celtic tunes playing in the background.
 Tuesday evening, while leftovers warmed in the oven and Irish music played, lightening flashed and thunder added extra beats and base notes that shook the windows. The birdfeeder was taken down in the rain. My husband returned to the house, passing the plastic greenhouse nestled under the elm and redcedars. The front door was slightly open. He glanced inside. There sat two dry raccoons looking back at him. Should have offered them some corned beef and cabbage!

PROVIDENCE -- Ariana Pizzanelli sat in a styling chair at Capelli Salon on Saturday morning as Sara Laroche painted blond highlights into her brunette locks.
   
 "I was thankful I got my appointment in time," said Pizzanelli, of Providence, who was one of about 25 customers the Federal Hill salon served on Saturday before a closure order from the city went into effect at 5 p.m.
   
 Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza on Friday afternoon directed certain businesses in the city -- including gyms, spas, beauty salons, barber shops, tattoo parlors and flea markets -- to close their doors indefinitely as of Saturday evening to help mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus.
   
 Around Providence on Saturday, as the clock ticked closer to 5 p.m., business owners served their last customers and contemplated their uncertain futures.
   
 "It's going to impact us terribly," said Wady Hernandez, who owns The Art of Barbering R.I., a shop on Broad Street. "As a business owner, and also the barbers that are here that work with me, we rely on this business to feed our families."
   
 Hernandez said he and the five other barbers who work in his shop are considered independent contractors, and therefore do not qualify for unemployment benefits. Hernandez has another job but said he worries about his barbers.
   
 Closing indefinitely, Hernandez said, will also leave a hole in the community that the barbers serve.
   
 "We're not only a barber shop, we also offer friendship to our customers, counseling sometimes," he said. "We're those guys that you can call when you're having problems with your kids, your wife. We're not just cutting hair."
   
 Dennis DelPrete, who owns Providence Tattoo, a parlor with locations on Atwells Avenue and Wickenden Street, said he and the tattoo artists he works with are also considered independent contractors.
   
 On Saturday afternoon, as he closed up his Atwells Avenue location, he said he was caught off-guard by the mayor's announcement on Friday. As long as he kept the number of people inside his shop to 10 or fewer, he figured he'd be allowed to remain open.
   
 "We lost our income," he said. "We're out of jobs due to this order."
   
 Elorza has not indicated when he might allow the businesses to open again, but DelPrete said he would be ready.
   
 "I plan on reopening as soon as we can," he said.
   
 At Capelli Salon, the nine stylists who work there are direct employees of the business and will be eligible for unemployment benefits while the salon is closed, said owner Michael Galvin.
   
 Galvin also owns the Michael K. Galvin Beauty and Business Academy, which closed last Friday due to concerns over the coronavirus.
   
 "I think what the mayor did is correct," Gavin said of Elorza's decision to close salons and other businesses in the city.
   
 The salon, which usually serves about 100 customers per week, canceled all appointments for the next two weeks.
   
 "I've been in business over 42 years and I've never seen anything like this happen," he said.
   
 Laroche, who has been stylist at Capelli Salon for more than a year, said she might try to find a job at a supermarket or collect unemployment.
   
 "I'm freaking out a little," she said, as she folded foils into her client's hair.

The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference announced more positive COVID-19 tests on Saturday, and this round hit home for Niagara University.
 Two days after announcing a pair of game officials from its conference tournament had tested positive, the MAAC said Saturday in conjunction with the Collegiate Officiating Consortium that it had become aware of "additional persons on or near the floor during certain Horizon League and Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference games who have tested positive for COVID-19."
 At least one person attended Niagara's Battle of the Bridge meeting with rival Canisius on March 6 at the Koessler Athletic Center in Buffalo. Listed attendance for the game was 1,805.

We know that women and girls - especially those living in poverty - are disproportionately affected by a lack of water and sanitation services, making SDG 5 and 6 fundamentally interdependent. Inadequate sanitation and hygiene put women's health and survival at risk during pregnancy and childbirth. Girls may drop out of school or suffer psychological stress because of the lack of adequate sanitation and hygiene facilities in their communities. In 8 out of 10 households without a water source on the premises, women and girls are responsible for water collection. Globally, they spend an estimated 200 million hours collecting water every day. In addition to placing them at risk of violence and harassment, spending time on water collection can prevent girls from attending school and limits women's ability to engage in other productive activities. Furthermore, despite being responsible for household water needs, women are often under-represented in water governance, including water user committees. As a result, development policies fail to recognize women as key stakeholders in water management and perpetuate cycles of gender inequality.

I punched the keys on the laptop in the makeshift work space on my dining room table Tuesday.
   
 Fifteen feet away, my 6-year-old daughter, Roslyn, and 5-year-old daughter, Maryn, pushed other buttons -- each other's.
   
 What ensued was a minor brawl at the Barbie DreamHouse.
   
 Working remotely and juggling parental duties amid a two-week school cancellation is the new normal in my household.
   
 It's challenging enough reporting on the local impact of a global pandemic. News is breaking as fast as the new coronavirus seems to be spreading. Add cooped-up kids to the mix and that challenge becomes even more daunting.
   
 But the distractions and disruptions are understandable. No one, especially our children, knows what's happening right now.
   
 Mine don't show it, but I know they're trying to make sense of a world that has come to a stop while a dangerous illness continues to spread. It's all they hear their mom, an office manager at a local doctor's office, and dad talk about.
   
 Leea and I try to explain why they need to frequently wash their hands, why play dates and sleepovers with friends aren't part of the indefinite hiatus from school, why they can't accompany us into the grocery store.
   
 Our oldest daughter, Sophia, a 10-year-old fourth-grader, asked me to lay with her Thursday night until she fell asleep. Each time I thought she was dozing off she popped her head up from her pillow and peppered me with a question: "Is school going to be canceled for the rest of the year? Where will we go if it is? Will I have to go back to fourth grade next year?"
   
 Mom and dad will do our best to take care of her and her little sisters, I told her. No matter how unfamiliar and unsettling the weeks and months ahead are everything will work out just fine, I said.
   
 I just wish I could assure myself of the same.
   
 It's one thing to tell your kid there's not a monster in the closet, that their stomach bug will eventually go away or that the cut on their knee will heal. It's another when you worry your wife might contract the virus at work, when you wonder what the economic fallout means for your own job security or when you fear that your children will fall so far behind in school that the damage will be irreparable.
   
 If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that it's OK to feel uneasy about what's unfolding right now and what's to come in the weeks and months ahead -- no matter what it might be.

 FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Spring training returned right on time in mid-February. The Boys of Summer were back in town.
 Aahhh, the familiar smell of popcorn and hot dogs wafted through the grandstands. Fans enjoyed some Buds with their buds and talked about their favorite players. Relaxed Red Sox players signed autographs and chatted with fans.
 All that changed on March 12. That's the day the commissioner shut down our National Pastime. Current score: coronavirus 1, baseball 0.
 Here in Fort Myers and from Tampa to Tempe, there is crying in baseball. The gates were locked and the players were told to go home. Those same stands at JetBlue Park are now empty and aroma free. It's a dark day in Florida and Arizona.
 Players were told they could stick around and use the Sox training facilities. A day later, though, Major League Baseball switched gears and told most players to go home.
 JetBlue Park was suddenly a ghost town. It's March. There's supposed to be the crack of the bat, not dead silence!
 Every February and March since 1993, when the Red Sox moved to Fort Myers from Winter Haven, thousands of New Englanders have come here to watch their heroes. Many bought homes here -- Florida is a tax friendly state and has no state income tax.
 Snowbirds fly or drive to Lee County, which is halfway between Tampa and Miami on Florida's west coast. It's a place where nearly 700,000 people make their homes. About a quarter of a million of them are part-timers who escape the snow and ice for a few months.
 It used to be you would rarely see a license plate from Massachusetts or Rhode Island or Maine, etc. When I first came here in 1987, most of the out-of-state plates were from Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. Not anymore.
 The Red Sox are one of the most popular teams in Florida. Since moving to JetBlue in 2012, they have sold out every game -- 135 in a row. Incredibly, since coming to Fort Myers in 1993, it's been standing room only in all but one of the 249 home Grapefruit League games. They played for 18 years at City of Palms Park near downtown before moving 10 miles southeast into the new ballpark that was patterned after Fenway.
 For a time it appeared that major league players might return to their spring training sites. Originally, MLB said there would be a two-week delay to opening the season. A few days later a new start date was announced -- the second week of May. Realistically, no one has a clue when baseball will resume.
 Spring training is a significant financial boost for Florida and Arizona. Each year fans head south and west, bringing fat wallets and families in tow. A recent study showed that baseball visitors to Fort Myers alone spent nearly $70 million on their spring training visits. In the survey, of nearly 1,200 of those questioned, 50 percent said their primary reason coming to Fort Myers was for spring training.
 In other words, this area is taking a big financial hit since about half of the Grapefruit League schedule was canceled. People checked out early from their hotels, heading back to Pawtucket and Worcester and Hanover and all other parts of New England. Also gone from the area's economy are meals eaten at restaurants, beers guzzled in pubs and all the other places vacationers spend their money.
 Fort Myers is the most unique spring training city in baseball. There are actually four major league spring training parks here. The newest is JetBlue.
 There is Hammond Stadium, about five miles west of JetBlue and home of the Minnesota Twins, who came to town in 1991. City of Palms was built for the Red Sox and opened in 1993. Today, it's home to Florida Southwestern College's baseball team.
 And there is Terry Park on the east side of town. Built in the early 1920s, Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics trained there beginning in 1925. The Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals also trained there. This spring, a Korean Baseball League team used the ballpark.
 On the flip side of this national emergency, baseball fans have endured strikes, a canceled World Series, the Black Sox, cheating scandal, great teams, lousy teams.
 Baseball will be back this year this (we hope), but probably not here at JetBlue Park.

Two more Missourians died from the coronavirus Friday as the statewide total rose to 73 cases, almost triple the 28 reported at the end of the day before.


   


  The surge led Gov. Mike Parson to announce he would issue new orders Saturday setting a limit of 10 on public gatherings.


   


  St. Louis County officials said a woman in her 60s, who suffered from multiple health problems prior to being diagnosed with COVID-19, died at a hospital. Officials don't yet know if she had traveled or how she became exposed to the virus.


   


  Earlier Friday, on the other side of the state, Jackson County officials said a woman in her 80s died. She had not recently traveled, raising concerns about community spread, which is when experts can't figure out how a person caught the disease.


   


  The deaths were the second and third in Missouri, following the death of a Boone County resident in their 60s announced Wednesday.


   


  The total number of confirmed cases in Missouri rose to 73 by the state's count from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The jump was largely attributable to private lab test results being reported to the state.


   


  There were cases in 12 counties, with the largest numbers concentrated in the state's largest urban areas. Kansas City and Jackson County had 17 confirmed infections, with an additional six in adjoining Cass County.


   


  St. Louis County had 13 cases, with six in the city of St. Louis. Boone County has 10 confirmed infections and Greene County, in southwest Missouri, had eight.


   


  At least seven of the cases are linked to community spread within Missouri, with 44 undetermined at this time, according to the Department of Health.


   


  Parson escalated efforts to slow the spread, announcing that gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned, effective Saturday. He stressed that the order won't require businesses to close and includes exceptions for hospitals, pharmacies, grocery stores, and government and religious services.


   


  Some public health officials in the state want Parson to force people to stay home. The Kansas City Star obtained a letter dated Friday from the Missouri Center for Public Health Excellence, a group of public health departments representing half of the state's population. The letter urged the Republican governor to require that residents can only leave home for medical reasons, work or to get food.


   


  Parson's office didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.


   


  One of the new cases in south-central Missouri's Pulaski County also "does not appear to be travel related," the county health department said in a statement on Facebook. The patient is in isolation and the health department is trying to figure out who may have had close contact with the sick person.


   


  Missourians left without a job due to all the closures won't be able to get immediate in-person help from the state, which announced that all job centers are now closed to in-person services for at least a week. People seeking unemployment insurance can call the Department of Labor and State Industrial Relation's hotline at 1-800-320-2519 or go to uinteract.labor.mo.gov.


   


  For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.


   


  Branson city leaders banned social gatherings of more than 10 people, including performances and shows in the tourist destination. Businesses will be allowed to stay open if they don't exceed 25% of occupancy. Two major tourist attractions, Silver Dollar City and The Branson Belle river boat, have temporarily suspended operations.

Two more Benton County residents have tested positive for COVID-19, the infectious respiratory disease caused by the new strain of coronavirus, the county Health Department reported on Saturday.
 Both are between 40 and 50 years old, one male and one female. The female was likely exposed during domestic travel and is being treated at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center in Corvallis, county health officials announced. The male is not hospitalized and may have been exposed through his job as a health care provider.
 “We are doing our communicable disease investigation, looking at potential contacts,” said Charlie Fautin, who heads up the public health division of the Benton County Health Department.

U.S. authorities face growing calls to shutter all of the nation's immigration courts, and to release detained immigrants who do not pose a threat to public safety after an ICE detention center worker tested positive for the coronavirus.
 Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported for the first time this week that one of its workers has the virus that causes COVID-19. ICE also says there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus among its more than 37,000 detainees nationwide.
 But immigrant advocates and physicians warn that an outbreak in an ICE detention facility is inevitable as the pandemic spreads and the number of cases in the U.S. rises quickly.
 "A coronavirus outbreak at immigration detention facilities is imminent, if it's not already happening," said Silky Shah with the Detention Watch Network.
 More than 3,000 physicians signed a letter urging ICE to release detainees while their legal cases proceed — particularly adults over 60 and people with serious chronic medical conditions that would put them at higher risk in the event of an outbreak.
 "They're just stuck there like sitting ducks," said Dr. Ranit Mishori, who also signed the letter. Mishori is a professor at Georgetown University School of Medicine and medical adviser to the group Physicians for Human Rights. "The window of opportunity is rapidly, rapidly closing because I think we need to let them out before they become sick."

"I had planned to attend the Board of Supervisors meeting all along and that's where this was to come up first, in my opinion. And with the potential for Spring Break just around the corner, I was hoping there could be some steps to limit the possibility of large groups gathering on the beach."
 The mayor said the steps being taken - states of emergency, emergency declarations, and talk of curfews - are similar to what residents might see before a hurricane.
 "That's the best analogy for the public to remember," Gilich said. "There's no reason to be alarmed, or to overreact or underreact. This is just like preparing for a hurricane. Shelter in place. Just follow the advice, and the advice of the moment is limit travel. Follow the advice of the CDC and the Mississippi State Department of Health. Announcements by those agencies and local leaders will be made when necessary."

The Bess Jenkins Club met March 11 at Pine Bluff Country Club. The meeting was called to order by Sandy Poore, president, who led the members in the club motto.
   
 Program Chairwoman Lela R. Murray introduced the speaker, Rex Nelson, the senior editor of the Arkansas Democrat newspaper.
   
 He writes three columns a week and an essay weekly for the Sunday Perspective section. He is also an author of three books: the first full-length biography of Hillary Rodham Clinton; a biography of Arkansas educator Ben Elrod; and a collection of his own essays on Arkansas, according to a news release.
   
 Nelson makes regular television and radio appearances, and is the author of the blog, "Rex Nelson's Southern Fried." Nelson served for almost a decade as the policy and communications director for Gov. Mike Huckabee, and for four years in the administration of President George W. Bush as one of the president's two appointees to the Delta Regional Authority.
   
 He has been inducted into the Arkansas Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, Gov. Asa Hutchinson and the Arkansas Rural Development Commission named him as its Rural Advocate of the Year for the State of Arkansas.
   
 Nelson's topic at the Bess Jenkins Club was "A State of Disaster," which covered several floods and other natural disasters that impacted the economy and the people of Arkansas. He told how the Civil War and the period of reconstruction devastated the state, causing many people to abandon it for other areas of the country where the prospects of "making a living" were thought to be better. But he also told of the resilience of the people who stayed and worked.
   
 After the program, Poore asked for officer reports. Susan Westfall, secretary, called the roll and read the minutes from the February meeting. Mary Lee Hall, treasurer, gave the financial report.
   
 The hostesses for the meeting were Sheila Mitchell, Corrine Hunter, Renee Luis, and Pam Ratliff, who decorated the tables with a St. Patrick's Day theme.
   
 Poore adjourned the meeting, and dessert of key lime pie and coffee were served by the country club hostesses.

Since being tested, the patient, who was in the area visiting from another state at the time they sought treatment at Hazard ARH, has been in self- isolation at a home awaiting results of the COVID-19 test, according to the statement.

  "Based on these interactions, we feel the patient has taken all the responsible measures to protect themselves and those around them by properly self-quarantining," the statement said. "Due to patient privacy laws, and out of respect for this patient and their family, ARH will not release any further details about the patient."


  The statement said the medical system used protocols already in place to treat the patient.


  "As part of our extensive training on the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and preparation for the potential of COVID-19 in our facilities, during testing our medical staff took every precaution and followed the appropriate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocols to prevent exposure to staff and other patients," the statement said. "Due to these measures, no staff or patients were exposed nor require self-isolating,

This will not be the only case of COVID-19 we see in our communities,” Dr. Braman said. “It is our responsibility as healthcare professionals to be prepared for these cases, and at ARH, we are prepared. Furthermore, it also is our responsibility as citizens to help control the spread of COVID-19 by limiting our exposure to others and practicing the CDC recommendations for social distancing and hand- washing practices. That is the only way we can get ahead of the spread of this virus.”


  The statement said that, to help combat the potential spread of COVID-19 into our areas, over the last week, ARH put the following steps in place to keep our patients, employees and caregivers as safe as possible.

 Passengers also are asked use the back door to get on and off the bus. Those who need to use the ramp can continue to get on and off at the front door.
 In addition, in accordance with guidance from the Florida Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to maintain social distancing, passengers are asked to space themselves out as much as possible after boarding the bus.
 Starting Monday, March 30, PSTA is scaling back overall services by 40% by implementing Saturday hours of 7 a.m.-8 p.m. Officials say as more businesses close and travel is discouraged, reducing hours of service will allow more than 100 PSTA employees to stay home while still continuing to provide transportation to those with no other option.
 PSTA had already suspended certain transit services due to cancellations, including the spring training baseball shuttles and Clearwater Beach spring break shuttle.

Jam session is an opinion forum offering comments on issues from a group of Plymouth residents. It appears on the Forum pages in the Weekend edition of the OCM.
 The newspaper poses a question to the group each week, and participants choose whether to comment. This column is designed to bring the voices of well- informed residents into the Forum page to address issues, one at a time.
 Participants cross the local political spectrum and live throughout the town. Some are current or past Town Meeting representatives, and all are active in the community. We hope their diverse points of view will encourage discussion of the issues Plymouth faces.
 This week's question  
 The Plymouth 400 opening ceremonies have been postponed two months to late June. The Mayflower Sails 2020 event, which was going to welcome Mayflower II's return, in Boston, is being postponed from its May date until - date unknown. Now we're hearing it could take until July or August for the virus to no longer be a concern in the U.S. How do you think Plymouth's 400th anniversary will ultimately be impacted by the coronavirus?
 Pat Adelmann
 The unknown timeline of the COVID 19 outbreak brings so much anxiety to our community. When it is finally over, we will be most relieved, grateful, and eager to celebrate. Participating in the postponed Plymouth 400 events gives us something joyful to anticipate. The impact will be a great outpouring of survivors from 2020 saluting the survivors of 1620.
 Pat Adelmann has been a Plymouth resident since 1977 and is a mother of five Plymouth Public School graduates, a proud grandmother of 12, a former School Committee member and a former Town Meeting representative.
 Ed Angley
 This is going to be a disaster for all 400th activities. Town hall is closed. Plimouth Plantation is closed. Europe is banned. Asia is banned. This was supposed to be one of the biggest, if not the biggest, tourist season ever for Plymouth and Plimoth Plantation. The tourist season will be over before it starts. I suspect that many restaurants will not survive. Nothing I can do about it.
 Ed Angley is an attorney specializing in zoning and land use. He is a former Scout leader and coach.
 Jay Beauregard
 Plymouths' birthday is the least of everybody's problems.
 In my opinion there are going to be millions of people out of work due to this sickness. Once this blows over, which could be late summer, people are going to just try to catch up on their unpaid bills. Taking a vacation to Plymouth, Massachusetts, to see something that they can see any other time at all is not going to be their priority.
 Our concern country-wide should be just to get regular businesses back up and running. Then and only then will people start to have disposable income to spend on going on vacations and blowing on a good night out.
 Plymouth as a tourist town is going to take a big hit.
 We will prevail.

 "Suppose they threw a party and nobody came" - tHAT is exactly where we're at. Postpone it for a year. That - in my humble opinion - is the only sensible solution. And while you're at it, add a $1-million reward (insured, like the Jordan's furniture giveaways) for recovery and return of the original Mayflower Compact to Plymouth. Most believe it's destroyed; insurance should be cheap but well worth it for global publicity.

 400th, my life, yours have been all been impacted beyond belief. And all for good (not so good) reason. In regard to 2020, we should extend the celebrations to 2021 and beyond. Just think, after this is over everyone, everywhere, will be itching to go out to enjoy themselves. And Plymouth will welcome them with open arms.

 All of the news so far is discouraging and downright depressing. Covid-19 is keeping us in our homes, away from our work, away from our friends. Today was the saddest St. Pats in my life. Tom Brady is leaving New England. Plymouth 400 events postponed, town government cannot meet. Town Meeting is postponed too. Just going to the grocery store is depressing. Restaurants, businesses closed, musicians, waitstaff, workers, cooks, etc., losing their livelihood, and the latest information is making me worry that Project Arts' 25th season is in jeopardy. This very well could be the 400th anniversary, celebrated in 2021.

 Delayed and diminished. Years of preparation for 2020 and now the celebration is being strangled in its crib. Not only the Plymouth 400 events, but all of the programs at the Library, at the Museum, at Wildlands Trust, at Plimoth Plantation - cancelled or postponed. It makes us so very sad. While I grieve the delays, they pale compared to the profound societal pain and disruptions now caused by this pandemic. It is totally appropriate to postpone, however even if the schedule reboots to a June start, attendance would not make up for the loss of the spring months. All those who had planned to come in April, May and early June would not necessarily all come for the opening celebration in its new time. To allow for the current uncertainties about when to restart, I would propose that Plymouth 400 shift all activities to start in the fall, perhaps in September on the 400th anniversary of the sailing of the Mayflower, continue events all fall, including Thanksgiving, and reschedule certain events in 2021. This is not only historically more accurate, but it will help us see our way through what lies ahead.

 While it would be ideal to start the 400 festivities first thing as temperatures warm, there is no reason it can't be held later. While we certainly can't postpone it to the Pilgrims' actual arrival date, Nov. 11, we can wait until summer. Not too early in the summer because the long tail of COVID-19 will still be out there intimidating tourists. August-September seems achievable and Labor Day weekend might work best.

Masks and gloves have been distributed to bus operators for the past two weeks. Officials say the operator safety shields installed on most buses have helped in enforcing distancing between drivers and passengers.
 PSTA is working to keep the buses clean and sanitized. Officials say that cleaning crews have tripled their efforts to disinfect all vehicles, terminals and facilities daily with high-grade sanitizers and multi-purpose cleaners.
 Crews are focusing on hard surface, high-contact areas, such as handrails, doors, handles, windows, panels and seats and are cleaning them multiple times a day.
 Sick people are advised to stay home. If they must ride the bus, they are asked to avoid close contact with others. All passengers are asked to cough or sneeze into a tissue or their upper sleeve, elbow. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands. Avoid touching surfaces when you can.
 PSTA has canceled all board of directors meetings and committee meetings until April 14. Offices and administrative services remain open.
 “At PSTA, we understand that this will impact the lives of many of our riders, and we sincerely apologize for challenges this may present,” officials said in the press release. “This is a unique time in our history, and we are adjusting, like so many public agencies, in order to keep people safe. As soon as public health officials give us clearance that it is safe, we will resume normal operational service.”

The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, finds himself almost constantly looking at financial numbers and projections. And like the rest of a world that is dealing with the seismic effects of the coronavirus pandemic, he still isn't sure how bad things will get.
   
 Silver said on Saturday that the league is considering all options -- best- case, worst-case and countless ideas in between -- as it tries to come to grips with this new normal. But definitive answers on any front are in short supply.
   
 "It's too soon to tell what the economic impact will be," Silver said. "We've been analyzing multiple scenarios on a daily, if not hourly, basis and we'll continue to review the financial implications. Obviously, it's not a pretty picture but everyone, regardless of what industry they work in, is in the same boat."
   
 Saturday marked the 10th full day of the NBA's shutdown, a stoppage that has cost the league 75 games and counting, a total that will reach triple digits on Wednesday and will eventually get to 259 on April 15 -- the day the regular season was supposed to end. Play isn't going to resume by then. The financial losses will be massive and will obviously just keep growing if this season cannot resume or if next season is affected.
   
 "Adam is obviously cautious, cautiously optimistic," Cleveland forward Kevin Love said earlier in the week. "We don't know what the future holds but the NBA has been through a lot, we've seen a lot and I think we'll be incredibly resilient. It just might take time."
   
 Players who are due to get their next paycheck on April 1 will get them. Whether those players will get their April 15 check is in some question; the league can exercise a clause in the Collective Bargaining Agreement that allows it to take back 1.08% of each player's salary for each game missed in certain times -- like war, or in this case, a pandemic.
   
 That clause has not been exercised yet since, officially anyway, no game has been canceled.
   
 "We're exploring all options to resume our season if and when it is safe to do so," Silver said. "Nothing is off the table."
   
 Besides, there are other bridges to cross first. The NBA -- which was the first major U.S. pro league to say it would play games without fans and the first league to suspend its season once All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive -- has been extremely vocal in trying to get its massive fan base to take social distancing and other preventative measures seriously.
   
 "Our focus right now is doing all that we can to support, engage and educate the general public in response to this pandemic," Silver said. "We are also making sure that we are prepared to resume the season if and when it becomes safe for all concerned."
   
 The league has asked teams for building availability dates through the end of August, an indicator that this season -- if it resumes -- may stretch deep into the summer.
   
 So far, there are 14 people within the NBA community, including at least 10 players, known to have tested positive for COVID-19. Of those positive tests, seven became known publicly on Thursday. Marcus Smart of the Boston Celtics revealed that he has the virus.
   
 "Unfortunately, based on everything we know, significantly more positive cases in our league were inevitable," Silver said. "So, Thursday's results did not come as a huge surprise and just like everyone else, we're just trying to take each day as it comes."
   
 For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.
   
 Entering Saturday, there were about 19,000 known positive cases in the United States and more than 250 deaths blamed on the virus. Globally, there have been nearly 300,000 cases diagnosed so far with nearly 12,000 deaths. The virus first exploded in mainland China, where the NBA has offices and about 200 employees.
   
 "We've learned a lot from our China office," Silver said, noting that meetings have been of the virtual variety there for several weeks now.
   
 Silver's sixth full season as commissioner of the NBA started with the league getting into a major rift with China. His mentor and NBA commissioner emeritus David Stern died two months later. Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash less than a month after that.
   
 Now he is dealing with the biggest crisis of them all -- a pandemic, affecting and threatening virtually every corner of the planet.
   
 "It's been a challenging season," Silver said, "for all of us."

ROME -- Standing together before nearly 100 members of the International Olympic Committee, Sofia Goggia and Michela Moioli felt like they were on top of the world.
 Each an Olympic gold medalist, Goggia the skier and Moioli the snowboarder dabbed in unison for a moment that was later considered vital in Milan- Cortina's successful bid to host the 2026 Olympics.
 Eight months later, Goggia and Moioli feel like their worlds are crumbling apart.
 Locked inside their homes just a few miles apart in the Bergamo area of northern Italy that is struggling to keep up with the coronavirus, they are surrounded by death and despair.
 Moioli's grandmother died after being infected with the virus and her grandfather, who also tested positive, remains in intensive care.
 "It's a war at home," Moioli said. "The town is completely deserted. The only sounds you hear are church bells ringing for deaths and ambulances. Outside the cemetery, coffins are stacked up because there's nobody to bury them.
 "Every family has at least one person with the coronavirus," Moioli added.
 For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus.
 Bergamo is the epicenter of the hardest-hit province of Italy's hardest-hit region, Lombardy, the site of hundreds of coronavirus deaths. Families there are deprived of a bedside farewell with virus-stricken loved ones, or even a traditional funeral, and the cemetery is so overwhelmed by the number of dead that military trucks transported 65 bodies to a neighboring region for cremation this week.
 "This is what we're hearing from our homes," Goggia tweeted Thursday in Italian when she shared a photo of the procession of military trucks carrying the bodies away.
 This was turning out to be a memorable year for Bergamo, with its soccer team, Atalanta, qualifying for the quarterfinals of the Champions League -- a remarkable achievement for a provincial club.
 Now, though, the Champions League is on hold.
 "The hospitals, especially in the Bergamo area, are about to fall apart," Goggia wrote on Instagram. "The thought that so many elderly people are facing such tough days breaks my heart. They are dealing with a devastating sense of solitude and despondency.
 "We've got to be resilient," added Goggia, who won the coveted downhill title at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics.
 Moioli, who won gold in snowboard cross in Pyeongchang, was forced to leave her home near Bergamo at the end of January when the virus first hit and move into military barracks in Courmayeur in order to finish the World Cup season and avoid being quarantined.
 While she had already clinched her third season-long World Cup title, Moioli made a point of winning the final race of the season in Veysonnaz, Switzerland, a week ago. Afterward, she broke down into tears during a post- race interview, saying that she had raced "for my hometown."
 Days later, Moioli's grandmother, Camilla, passed away.
 "The funeral lasted only five minutes. There wasn't even time to gather the family," Moioli said. "Now we're praying for grandpa Antonio. When this is all finished it will be even better to be Italians. People will be better, more unselfish."

PLYMOUTH - When you saw the name Savastano on the roster, you knew they had to be good.


  The oldest brother, Mike, had a great baseball and football career at Coyle and Cassidy High School.


  The middle child, Jocelyn, used her track star speed to give opponents nightmares on the soccer and softball fields at Plymouth North and then St. Anselm College.


  The youngest of the three Savastano kids, Scott, was a three-sport star for the Blue Eagles (football, hockey and baseball). He was chosen in the MLB draft three different times and made it all the way to AAA in the Seattle Mariners organization before retiring after a seven-year pro baseball career in 2014.


  As with every family tree, the Savastano's strength comes from their roots.


  "I think we all got our athletic ability from our parents, Stephen and Debbie," said Jocelyn Savastano-Aguilar. "I remember as kids we were always doing something active outdoors and I think that helped us develop our athletic ability at a young age."


  Somewhere along the line it also developed a competitive edge that still simmers inside Jocelyn.


  "Oh yeah, I still got it," said Savastano, now 35 and the mother of three. "I still play in a women's indoor soccer league and that's really where my competitive nature comes out."


  But, just like back in her high school days, even if someone on the soccer pitch was mad at her it would be nearly impossible to catch up with Jocelyn's because of her foot speed.


  "I think my speed is what helped separate me from other players," Jocelyn said. "Even as a kid I could always run fast and I tried to exploit that advantage as much as I could."


  Her quickness usually translated into points on the scoreboard. She ranks first at Plymouth North in career points (141), first in career goals (99) and third in career assists (42). Jocelyn also holds the top three spots in single-season goals (31, 25 and 24).


  She was a three-time league all-star, making the Eastern Massachusetts and All-State team twice. Her senior year she was named an All-American and chosen as the top girls soccer player in the state. She was also a four-year player at second base for the softball squad.


  "Jocelyn is one of the top girls soccer players to come through the Plymouth High Schools," Plymouth North Head Coach Eric Foley said. "During her four- year varsity career she appeared in the South Semifinals twice and the Sectional Finals once. Her senior year we scored 12 goals in the tournament games and she had a part in all of them with five goals and seven assists.


  "Jocelyn was one of the most competitive athletes I have ever coached," Foley said. "She had the will to win and made everyone around her better because of her drive and leadership."


  Her success continued at St. Anselm College, where she was named an All- American again and even made the "Faces in the Crowd" section of Sports Illustrated as a sophomore when she scored seven times in an 8-0 win over New England College. Her name covers the Hawks women's soccer record book, including the top career mark for goals, assists, points, game-winning goals and shots on goal among other accolades.


  And, as a senior, she gave softball one final whirl and had a great year on the diamond.


  "It would have been tough to play two sports and go to classes, so when soccer was done I played my senior year as a walk-on with the softball team and had a great time," Jocelyn said.


  Following the path of accolades won by his older sister was a tough task, but Scott more than held his own at North, Franklin Pierce and then on the minor league baseball scene.


  Scott transitioned effectively from the soccer pitch to the football field during high school. He was a force on the ice during hockey season and then made a huge impact as a four-year starter with the Blue Eagles baseball team before graduating in 2005.


  "I actually thought I was going to be a hockey player," said Scott, who has three children with his wife, Josie. "Then I went to some camps and played against guys my own size and decided baseball was the sport for me."


  That's exactly what Plymouth North Baseball Head Coach Dwayne Follette had been telling Scott all along.


  "Scott is the best hitter I've ever coached. Period," Follette said. "He had power at the plate but the thing that set him apart from the rest was his impeccable pitch selection. Scott had the ability to work a pitcher to get the pitch he wanted."


  Scott hit .340 as a sophomore when the state went to wooden bats for a year. They switched back to aluminum bats the next year, hitting .660 as a junior and then .550 as a senior "despite the fact that no pitcher wanted to pitch to him," said Follette.


  Scott and good friend Doug Balboni represented Plymouth North at Fenway Park in the state all-star game as seniors, setting the stage for one of his favorite high school baseball memories.


  "I remember the at-bat like it was yesterday," Scott said. "It was a 2-2 count and I took a fastball right down the middle but the umpire called it a ball. Now the count is 3-and-2 and the pitcher comes back with a change-up that I sat back on and hit it over the Green Monster."


  He was drafted by the Chicago White Sox after his senior year of high school but chose to stick with Franklin Pierce. Baltimore drafted him after his junior year of college but he was coming off an injury and wanted to make one more run at an NCAA DII title. Those dreams fell short as a senior and then Scott was drafted a final time, this time by Seattle, and he signed his first professional contract.


  Scott spent six years with the Mariners organization, reaching as high as Triple A Tacoma for two seasons. He was released by Seattle in January, 2014 and joined up with the Baltimore organization a day later. He was released during spring training and called it a career in order to start his family.


  "I got a couple calls from teams who wanted me, but at that time Josie was about to give birth to twins and it was time to start real life," Scott said. "No regrets. I had a good run with baseball."


  Jocelyn and Scott still live in Plymouth with their families. Scott is a correctional officer for Plymouth County and runs the Savastano Hitting business in town. Jocelyn recently opened her own business, the Big Leaps Preschool and Daycare.


  Each week during 2020, the 50-for-50 project will profile a Plymouth person or state championship team that positively impacted the town in the last 50 years. To nominate someone, email Sports Editor David Wolcott Jr. at dwolcott@wickedlocal.com with information on the nominee.

Preventing transmission of the COVID-19 disease requires that we consistently exercise proper health and hygiene protocols, both in our homes and in public spaces. Authorities have also advised that we all steer clear of large gatherings, avoid using public transportation, follow “community quarantine” measures, and seek prompt medical attention when there is exposure to the disease. While all these are sound reminders, there is one glaring problem – the poor will not be able to afford to follow these.

However, with the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic AND a brutal oil war threatening most economies of our planet, I expect the western nations to simply lose interest in the Ukraine: they will be too busy scrambling to recover from the political fallout of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. As for Russia, there is absolutely no way that she will agree to foot the bill for the reconstruction of the Ukraine, nor will she provide the forces needed to get rid of the Ukronazis. Which means that for the foreseeable future, the Ukraine will be mostly left on its own. Russia will, of course, continue to support Novorussia (for example, SARS-CoV-2 testing kits have already arrived from Russia) while distributing Russian passports to anyone wanting one (the vast majority of the people of Novorussia).

Fourth, it is pretty clear who the kingmaker of the Ukraine is: Arsen Avakov, the “eternal” (by Ukrainian standards) Minister of the Interior.

Nursing major Agape Montero’s project is to write a book for middle school children about mental health awareness.

  She said she won't be able to present her book at middle schools how she originally wanted.

 I punched the keys on the laptop in the makeshift work space on my dining room table Tuesday.
 Fifteen feet away, my 6-year-old daughter, Roslyn, and 5-year-old daughter, Maryn, pushed other buttons -- each other's.
 What ensued was a minor brawl at the Barbie DreamHouse.
 Working remotely and juggling parental duties amid a two-week school cancellation is the new normal in my household.
 It's challenging enough reporting on the local impact of a global pandemic. News is breaking as fast as the new coronavirus seems to be spreading. Add cooped-up kids to the mix and that challenge becomes even more daunting.
 But the distractions and disruptions are understandable. No one, especially our children, knows what's happening right now.
 Mine don't show it, but I know they're trying to make sense of a world that has come to a stop while a dangerous illness continues to spread. It's all they hear their mom, an office manager at a local doctor's office, and dad talk about.
 Leea and I try to explain why they need to frequently wash their hands, why play dates and sleepovers with friends aren't part of the indefinite hiatus from school, why they can't accompany us into the grocery store.
 Our oldest daughter, Sophia, a 10-year-old fourth-grader, asked me to lay with her Thursday night until she fell asleep. Each time I thought she was dozing off she popped her head up from her pillow and peppered me with a question: \" _Is school going to be canceled for the rest of the year? Where will we go if it is? Will I have to go back to fourth grade next year?\"_
 Mom and dad will do our best to take care of her and her little sisters, I told her. No matter how unfamiliar and unsettling the weeks and months ahead are everything will work out just fine, I said.
 I just wish I could assure myself of the same.
 It's one thing to tell your kid there's not a monster in the closet, that their stomach bug will eventually go away or that the cut on their knee will heal. It's another when you worry your wife might contract the virus at work, when you wonder what the economic fallout means for your own job security or when you fear that your children will fall so far behind in school that the damage will be irreparable.
 If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that it's OK to feel uneasy about what's unfolding right now and what's to come in the weeks and months ahead -- no matter what it might be.

 Thursday morning, Mayor George McGill released a statement on the status of the River Valley in light of recent events, but some residents question if it is enough.
 The first case of COVID-19 in the state of Arkansas was confirmed on March 11 and City Administrator Carl Geffken held a meeting with all the department heads on March 13 to discuss plans of action.
 \"The city will remain open,\" said Geffken. He went on to assure residents that the city is trying to do what is best for them during this pandemic.
 The city is in the process of letting all non-essential staff work from home and has put in place extra precautions for those who cannot.
 As of Thursday, Geffken expressed a plan that closed off all but the first floor of the city office building to the public. On the first floor, there is more space between workers and residents.
 Last week, Geffken asked each department head to come up with a three-phase plan to be enacted as the coronavirus spread. Geffken said these phases were meant to be put in place gradually whether that be over the course of days or weeks.
 However, reportedly due to the acceleration of the virus, department heads have had to go from phase one to phase three at the beginning of the week.
 On Wednesday, Director of Sanitation Kyle Foreman released an announcement that only essential services would take place through April 3. After that date, they will likely reassess if they are able to provide full service again.
 Geffken said sanitation workers are still being paid, but this and other departments are rotating shifts in order to have as few workers present at one time. He emphasized that workers are still being paid through this time.
 Geffken called the current action plan fluid because the city has a plan, but they are being forced to put it into effect much sooner than anticipated.
 While the city did finish shutting off water for those who had more than $500 due for more than 120 days, they have stopped that process for the foreseeable future. Utility departments have also waived late fees and shutoffs.
 Several individuals on the Fort Smith Resident's Forum Facebook group have expressed frustration as to the apparent confusion, but Geffken said he plans to keep everyone updated with press releases and on the city website.
 In McGill's statement, he and several other mayors and medical professionals urged residents to work from home if at all possible and to follow guidelines from the CDC, the governor's office, the Arkansas Department of Health and the health departments of their respective counties.
 Geffken noted that the city of Fort Smith cannot do anything without the approval of the government at the state and federal level. At this time, there are many unknowns for this virus, but Geffken, who was working in New York City during 9/11, said he believes the city is doing as much as it can to keep Fort Smith safe and strong.

“We had a lot of self-motivation coming into this year,” Avant said. “The majority of coaches picked us to finish last in the region, and that stayed on our bulletin board all season long.”
 But Avant knew the talent he had returning — and by the end of the season, so did everyone else.
 Johnsonville went from cellar dwellers to region champs, finishing 20-2 overall and 13-1 in Region 7-2A in one of the biggest turnaround seasons in recent memory.
 For helping guide JHS back to the top of the pack and into the playoffs, Avant was named the Morning News Boys’ Basketball Coach of the Year.
 “I think the team chemistry was the main thing,” he said. “This group of guys has played together since middle school, and finally getting everybody back together and knowing how to play together helped. The talent level was there; it was just a matter of making sure everyone was on the same page with the game plan.”
 That part fell to Avant and his staff, whose biggest task was putting that talent in the right places at the right times throughout the course of a game.

_Don't the usual objections to government spending apply?_ Sure. There is a deadweight loss of taxation. My proposal simply assumes that the government should be spending money for the relevant purpose, whether on new ventilators or to help people get by in a crisis. It addresses _how_ the government can distribute money to many claimants, some with stronger claims on the money than others, when it is difficult to craft ex ante rules. In a hypothetical world without externalities and perfectly efficient markets, we would not need this system. Similarly, I am not making a claim that I have found the best thing to spend money on (although ventilators seem to me to be quite cost- effective now).

 Before statehood our neighborhood was part of the Great Osage Nation. It took nearly 20 years after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 for Missouri to gain enough population to apply for statehood, which finally took place in 1821. However, a 26-mile wide strip, where we live today, between Fort Osage and the Kansas border, was held onto by the Osage and was not open for American settlement until 1825. As the papers were being signed in 1825 between the Great Osage and the U.S. government at Fort Osage, there were as many as 50 wagons of American settlers awaiting permission to move in and stake a land claim.
 One of the first official acts of the state of Missouri was to designate our neighborhood as Jackson County, in honor of the popular General Andrew Jackson. Then, one of the first acts of the new county was to locate a county seat and then issue a contract for the construction of a courthouse.
 They figured it would take a while to construct a new brick courthouse on the Independence Square, so in order to conduct county business immediately, they issued a $150 contract to build a log cabin courthouse to be built one block east of the Square.
 They proceeded to cut a number of black walnut trees from around the Square and Sam Shepard, a slave, was chosen to hew the logs and construct the temporary courthouse. He did such a good job that the structure still stands to this day.
 Built as a temporary courthouse, the log building ceased county operations in 1831 upon the completion of the permanent brick facility on the Independence Square. The following year, the log courthouse was purchased by Algenon Sidney Gilbert, an agent for the Mormon Church, who used it as his home and a store to assist relocating members. Mr. Gilbert's store became a central focus of the Mormons' rapid development as a successful commerce community. Gilbert and his family were driven from the store just two years later following attacks on the building by area ruffians who wanted to rid the county of these religious newcomers.
 You would be fascinated by the history that fills this rudimentary structure, which for four years served as the last courthouse between Independence and the Pacific Ocean. If walls could talk, we'd be astonished at what these well- worn logs could tell us, including the story of an angel who visited the courthouse in 1834.
 It was the region's seat of justice in the beginning of the Santa Fe Trail trade and later served as a saddle shop, church, a Mormon mercantile, \"house of entertainment,\" residence, and home to the Community Welfare League. Now the Log Cabin Courthouse stands as a tribute to the founding and development of Independence.
 Roots of Harry and Bess Truman can even be traced to the Log Courthouse. Bess chaired a 1920s fundraising and restoration effort for the historic building. As a result, the log structure was restored and was relocated to its current location. When Harry Truman was Eastern Jackson County judge he held court in the log structure in the 1930s while the present-day brick courthouse on the Square was being remodeled.
 While walking early one morning with Mr. Truman, he told me that my uncles, Herb and Tom Noland, owned a Studebaker agency one block south of the old log courthouse and during the time he was at the log building, he spent his lunch hour down at the dealership playing poker with those two.
 Today, the historic Log Cabin Courthouse stands at 107 W. Kansas Ave., one block south of the Square and is open free to the public at times with a guided tour.

As formally announced today by Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH) has now confirmed there has been a patient tested at the Hazard ARH Regional Medical Center who has officially been confirmed as testing positive for COVID-19, according to a statement from ARH.


  This is the first patient in the 13-hospital ARH system to test positive for COVID-19, the statement said.


  “ARH is committed to being as transparent as possible to keep our communities safe and informed as we move through this rapidly evolving situation that COVID-19 has become. We want our public to be fully aware if there is a case in their community so they can take additional measures to protect themselves and those around them,” said Dr. Maria Braman, ARH Chief Medical Officer. “However, due to patient confidentiality and the turnaround time for tests to be processed as commercial labs get up and running, we encourage the public and the media outlets that are trying to keep them informed, to please have patience, and respectfully ask that everyone be considerate of these patients’ privacy. We understand these are scary and stressful times, but processing these tests takes time and we have been instructed that all positive confirmations are verified by the state and announced by Gov. Beshear’s office.”

None of the above means that law schools should do nothing. As I noted at the beginning, I think reasonable accommodations should be made. In my view, an optional pass/no-credit option represents a compassionate release valve for those students most disrupted or harmed by who need that assistance and does the least harm to other competing interests, including the need to encourage our students who can to stay engaged and continue to learn. Is such an approach perfect? Of course not. Might some students still find the current situation particularly difficult and the prospect of grades--even the potential of grades--an added source of stress? Yes. Might some other students "game" the system or take advantage? Yes again. I nonetheless believe this is a better alternative to pass/fail grades across the board.

It was quite serendipitous really, how the lives of two men would be forever enriched and intertwined, all because of a misidentified boat.
 Jim McCann worked for the United States postal service and served as postmaster general in Tatum. One day while out and about, he noticed a boat that curiously resembled his own. Thinking it could have been stolen, he decided to confront the man hauling what he believed to be his rig. Much to his chagrin, McCann discovered it purely coincidental.
 The man pulling the doppelganger boat, Earnum Rinkle, owned the local grocery store in Tatum. After realizing the heist was a hoax, the two men shared a good laugh and a lifelong friendship was born.
 You might call hook, line and forever friendship. The two gents decided to go fishing together, thus forming a partnership that’s sustained nearly three decades.
 And when the Tuesday Night Open Pot Bass Tournament kicks off its 30th year on Tuesday at Martin Creek, you can bet McCann and Rinkle will be in a boat competing. They haven’t missed too many opportunities since the event was founded back in 1990.
 The long-standing spring/summer angling event was founded by Dana Vinson and has run continuously for 30 years. McCann actually ran the tournament for nearly a decade, but has long since resigned himself to simply participating and doing so with his best friend.
 “I guess you’d call Dana the founding father of the tournament. He still fishes with us every now and then. But he’s not a diehard regular like Earnum and I. But no one is,” Mccann explained. “You can count on one hand the number of Tuesday nights we’ve missed. We always look forward to it. It’s a very low- pressure tournament, and we average about 20 boats every Tuesday night.”
 Entry fee for the Tuesday night tournament is set at $30 per boat, consisting one angler or two and the payback is 100%. Winner is determined on a five- stringer limit.
 “It’s a very inexpensive tournament to fish. We have fathers and sons, husbands and wives, fathers and daughters, boyfriends and girlfriends. It’s a very hodgepodge group of fisherman,” said McCann, 78, who is retired from the postal service living in Lakeport.
 The unique camaraderie shared between the two seasoned anglers is the primary reason their fellowship has flourished, according to Rinkle, five years McCann’s senior.
 “We fish so much alike and think alike,” Rinkle said. “You know you’ve got friends and you’ve got good friends. We’re good friends.
 “I’m 83 years old and don’t get around as well in boats. But we still fish. If it wasn’t for Jim I wouldn’t go fishing. Ain’t nobody else wants to waste time helping you in and out of the boat. That’s how good of friends we are.”
 McCann and Rinkle have won their fair share of Tuesday night gatherings. McCann attributes any success he Rinkle have on the water to sheer tenacity.
 “Earnum and I are by far the oldest team out there. We always ask for an old folks’ handicap and they all just laugh at us,” McCann contended. “We’re best friends and fish a lot of alike. He’s my partner and he will be as long as he wants to fish.”

This year, we also begin the 10-year countdown to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As we approach these milestones, it seems apt to take stock of the progress (or lack thereof) made on SDG 5 - gender equality and women and girls' empowerment, and SDG 6 - access to water and sanitation for all. While gender equality and the right to water and sanitation are intrinsically linked, we are far from achieving either of these goals.

Ogwumike committed to giving 28 families in need $100 each if they direct messaged her their stories and Venmo information. Instead of going out with her friends on her birthday, Ogwumike sat on her couch and spent most of Saturday scrolling through hundreds of direct messages from her more than 200,000 followers on Twitter and Instagram and sent $2,800 to strangers.
 “I know $100 is not a lot, but I don’t have a Kevin Love type of contract so I want to do what I can,” Ogwumike said. “I just felt that was the right thing to do instead of spending $2,800 on a Chanel purse, which would be nice. This is what makes my heart feel better during this crazy time.”
 Ogwumike has been bracing for “this crazy time” for a number of weeks, hoping her worst fears wouldn’t become a reality. Long before California and other states ordered residents to stay home because of the pandemic, Ogwumike has been cooped up in her apartment with a fully stocked refrigerator and kitchen cabinets.
 “When the coronavirus first started being talked about in China, I became aware of it,” Ogwumike said. “WNBA players have a different vantage point than other athletes. My sister, Nneka, was supposed to go play in China, so our family has been monitoring the coronavirus since January and what has been going on there. WNBA players go overseas in the offseason and we play in China and Italy and other parts of the world, so we have to keep up with international news and developments.

Under this assumption, implementing stricter social distancing measures faster (as per model 03 above) seems a prudent way to go. The health systems would not cope with the daily infection peak of 300,000 if we took till the end of May to fully implement policies (as per model 02 above).

He said things were changing at a rapid pace.
 “So we all just need to be in a mindset of compliance as we get through this virus,” he said, adding that he and Gualtieri were “very empathetic and talk frequently about how the coronavirus is impacting our community.”
 Slaughter reminded people that there are still places they can go, such as the Memorial Causeway Walkway or the sidewalks on Clearwater Beach.
 Gualtieri added that the Dunedin Causeway was still open, but not the beach areas. People are still able to take a walk on the causeway or ride their bicycles, he said.
 Gualtieri said the expectation is for people to make “a reasonable good faith effort and do the right thing.”
 As to the possibility of an arrest, the sheriff said, “People are going to have to beg their way into jail. But if they do something big that’s really, really silly and they’re very flagrant about it and they don’t listen to many asks, then we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.”
 He said it is his expectation that those instances will be rare or nonexistent.
 Besides the sheriff’s office and Clearwater police, the other police departments monitoring local beaches include Indian Shores and Treasure Island.
 Slaughter said he had plenty of personnel to patrol the beaches since he had already ramped up for another week of spring break activities. In addition, since school is out, school resource officers are available if needed.
 The sheriff doesn’t plan to put additional personnel on the beaches.
 Gualtieri still blames the national media for the closures. He said the video aired by CNN and other national media outlets as late as Thursday of the big crowd on Clearwater Beach on Monday had been irresponsible because it was an inaccurate representation of what was occurring.
 He said the decision to close the beaches was made in part by old news on the national media.
 “Playing the same clips over and over again that were totally inaccurate is not what the media should be doing,” he said.
 Pinellas County commissioners voted unanimously during a March 19 emergency meeting to close the beaches through at least April 6.

The VOC sensors and monitors market has been witnessing an upward growth trend and the sales of the devices equaled to nearly US$ 145 Mn in 2018. Surging law enforcement acts apropos of the occupational wellbeing of the workers operating in the confined industrial vicinity is among the chief growth driver of the VOC sensors and monitors market. Beside this, increasing concerns pertaining to the air quality, on the back of the rising levels of VOCs, especially in the developing countries is predicted to bode well for the growth of the VOC sensors and monitors market in the forthcoming years.

As a general principle, we should be compassionate to students who face difficult circumstances. But compassion does not mean anything goes. We generally recognize that there are good and bad ways to be compassionate. There are always students who face hardship and who, for reasons beyond their control, don't achieve their potential in a given course or semester. We make accommodations for those students on the margin, as we should, but rarely in ways that erase all the consequences of their hardship. Indeed, accommodating to that degree is often impossible to do. Significantly, we generally resist making changes that compromise other aspects of what we do as an educational institution or that potentially disadvantage other students. I think that same principle applies to the current situation.

President Donald Trump's insistence on speaking of a "Chinese virus" has a dark historical precedent for some Asian Americans, who say his word choice is fueling an at times violent backlash.


  Speaking daily on the global coronavirus pandemic, Trump has incessantly called COVID-19 the "Chinese virus," with one photo even showing his notes in which he had crossed out clinical terms preferred by health professionals.


  Asian American advocates say that such language plays into centuries-old stereotypes of the community as perpetually foreign and unclean -- and signals, incorrectly, that individuals of one ethnicity are responsible for spreading illness.


  While US incidents appear to be fewer than in Europe, New York police said that a man last month chased and beat an Asian woman wearing a protective mask on the subway, calling her "diseased."


  On Thursday, civil rights groups launched a site for Asian Americans to report bias crimes linked to the pandemic to see how widespread the problem has become.


  The site received 36 submissions in its first 24 hours, said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council.


  She pointed to one incident where a middle school bully in the Los Angeles area punched an Asian American classmate in the head some 20 times, accusing him of carrying the coronavirus, and telling him to "go back" to China.


  Kulkarni said she saw the violence as part of a wider history in the United States dating back to the "Yellow Peril," when suspicions about Asians led the United States in 1882 to ban all Chinese immigration.


  "I definitely think it will get worse, partly because of the president's relentless effort for weaponizing hate against communities," Kulkarni said.


  "He has the bully pulpit. With that comes tremendous power. People listen to him," she said.


  \- Caught in US-China tensions -


  Trump rose to power on vows to keep out Latin American and Muslim immigrants but has signaled that his intention in saying "Chinese virus" may be more about geopolitics.


  "It's not racist at all," he told a news conference. "It comes from China. I want to be accurate."


  The United States has wide-ranging tensions with China and Trump voiced anger over a Beijing official who promoted an unfounded conspiracy theory that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan, where cases were first reported.


  China's foreign ministry has accused Trump of seeking to shift blame over his own response to the pandemic.


  Frank H. Wu, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and author of "Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White," acknowledged that diseases were long given geographical names and said it was fair game to criticize Beijing's actions.


  "What's important here isn't the intent. It's the consequences. And these words matter, because this is a time of incredible stress," Wu said.


  Wu said that Asian Americans have long been associated with dirtiness, pointing to contemporary perceptions of Chinese restaurants.


  "Cleanliness has always been a metaphor for whether you're a morally deserving, good individual and part of a good community," he said.


  "So this isn't actually about just disease and the source of disease. It's symbolic of much, much more."


  \- Targeting Chinese over plague -


  In vivid examples of the association of Asian Americans with disease, authorities in 1900 sealed off the Chinatowns of both San Francisco and Honolulu after outbreaks of the bubonic plague.


  Charles McClain, a lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law who has written a book on the history of Chinese Americans' efforts against discrimination, said medical professionals at the time concluded that Asians were more susceptible to the plague.


  "It was a very crowded area," he said of San Francisco's Chinatown. "I don't think morbidity was any worse there than it was any other part of the city. But there was this sort of stereotype that played a large role in forming opinion."


  San Francisco was eventually forced to end its mandatory quarantine of Chinatown after a court agreed that authorities needed to prove that Chinese Americans were more likely to get infected.


  While no US officials are suggesting that Chinese Americans are spreading the coronavirus, Asian Americans have repeatedly borne the brunt of wider international tensions.


  Most notoriously, the United States detained 120,000 Japanese Americans in camps during World War II as it questioned their loyalty.


  Wu said that Asian Americans still struggle in not being identified as foreigners.


  "You can be an assimilated, English-speaking Christian who has never been to China and has high sanitary standards. People still somehow associate you with dirtiness and disease."

For over 400 years, chambers of commerce around the world have been champions of free enterprise, job creation and community response.


   


  In unsteady economic times throughout history, chambers have organized the troops, raised funds for war efforts, coordinated disaster response, been the voice of progress during civil unrest, lobbied for economic relief measures and have served so many other local and regional business purposes.


   


  COVID-19 is no different and, during this national healthcare crisis, the collective chamber community across the world is leading the charge in driving plans for business preparedness during the pandemic and the economic recovery and growth that must follow.


   


  We acknowledge that our travel, hospitality, healthcare, insurance, retail and service industries have been hit hard by this economic downturn and we are working around the clock to support them and others. So, how do we, as business networking organizations, do this in a time when "networking" is scarcely possible? Here are some ways in which Chambers should lead the business community in planning and preparing for economic recovery:


   


  • Be a resource for fact-based data, information and education on COVID-19 and business sustainability through this pandemic. From utilizing information on the Georgia Chamber and U.S. Chamber websites - www.gachamber.com/covid19 and www.uschamber.com/coronavirus, to providing companies with Small Business Administration disaster relief information, www.sba.gov/disaster, and encouraging them to connect with their local banking institutions for financial sustainability programs, we must continually educate and inform our members and partners.


   


  • Encourage corporate generosity. Chambers around the world are being asked to facilitate corporate response and support to hospitals, senior care facilities, food and supplies, logistics and thousands of other needs. goBeyondProfit.com is a strategic partner of the Georgia Chamber, taking pledges every day from businesses giving back to their local communities. Sometimes that comes in the form of cash donations, but in today's environment, it also comes in the form of amazing acts like utility companies waiving disconnect fees for customers. We applaud Georgia Power and Atlanta Gas Light who are delivering bottom line impact through this profound gesture. Businesses can all evaluate their operations and look for ways in which "giving back" can help the economy during this time.


   


  • Advocate at the federal, state and local levels for policies and strategies that will help our members, partners, public safety and government leaders to navigate, structure and lead during this time. This means working closely with the U.S. Chamber on federal policy, with your state chambers on state impact and actively engaging your local governments with recommendations and feedback from local businesses.


   


  • Lead by example. Follow government guidelines and implement them in your own chamber organizations. The Georgia Chamber has implemented a teleworking strategy for its employees and is still fully operational during the process. Get creative with digital technology when implementing your "social distancing" plans for networking and thought leadership functions, day-to-day operations and meetings. We should also follow the CDC recommendations and postpone events and programs to later dates. Do not cancel networking opportunities; reschedule them and find ways to incorporate additional opportunities for more regular business interaction in the summer and fall. More opportunities will lead to faster recovery. The Georgia Chamber is postponing events through mid-April and will closely monitor the situation to assess further action that may need to be taken, but we are planning now in anticipation of getting back on schedule in the predicted summer and fall months.


   


  •Above all, remind all our members that our local communities, and our state, are still open for business. As we work to inform and educate, as we support "flattening the curve" when it comes to the rate of spread and management needs of our healthcare system, the Georgia Chamber is reminding everyone that we are still operational as a business community. We are still creating, building, making, caring and serving.


   


  As we emerge from this pandemic, it goes without saying that there will be lasting impact to our economy. So, we must plan today for a robust economic recovery. It is during this time where chambers can make the biggest difference and live up to our historical reputation for being nucleic to business sustainability and resiliency.


   


  Connecting our members, hosting networking events, convening local response, promoting products, people and our communities - these are all ways in which we can help support a strong economic recovery. Lobbying our local and state governments for innovative relief efforts to waive fees, delay penalties, removing barriers and regulations will all help business get back in the game.


   


  It is critical that we begin strategic plans for economic recovery today to cultivate new partnerships with economic developers, downtown promotion groups and tourism councils. Chambers of Commerce are here to serve and lead, to support our investors, members, partners and communities in rebounding quickly. Ultimately, this is how we will save jobs and keep our economies growing.

AEI manufactures quality control and monitoring systems for textiles and safety and monitoring devices for the mining, railroad, health care and nuclear industries, and performs contract electro-mechanical assembly manufacturing.


  “Our primary business is textile machinery,” McComas said. “Almost every piece of denim in the world, the yarn in it went through our equipment. That’s our claim to fame.”


  The company used to export quite a lot of that equipment to China, McComas said, noting that the trade war “shut that down.” Still among AEI’s active clients are firms in Turkey, Brazil, Pakistan and Bangladesh.


  Recently, AEI had been working on a shipment bound for Turkey that totaled between $70,000 and $80,000, McComas said. And the company that had placed the order “pays 100 percent on shipment,” he noted. Then he received word that the Turkish company had closed down until April 9 due to the pandemic, canceling the order.


  That kind of thing has become typical since the virus began to spread, he said.


  “Companies quit spending on capital equipment and improvements when cash flow gets tight,” he said.


  “My orders have all fallen off a cliff, and my customers aren’t paying what they owe me,” McComas said. “I’m struggling to stay in business. I don’t have a huge cash reserve.”
