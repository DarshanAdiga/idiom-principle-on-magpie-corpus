There will be a meeting today between Danville Mayor Rickey Williams Jr. and Lynch family descendants to discuss the recent controversy generated by Williams over the naming of Lynch Road in eastern Vermilion County.
 The mayor told the City Council Tuesday night that he anticipates a fruitful dialog. We hope so. This particular controversy has been unnecessary and should be put to rest.
 At a June council meeting, Williams suggested that the city consider changing the name of Lynch Road because the word “lynch” has a negative connotation that could create an unwelcoming image for Danville at a time when racial tensions are elevated across the country.
 The word “lynch” refers to a type of violence used to target Blacks in the Jim Crow South in the decades after the Civil War. It was a way for whites to intimidate and exert domination over Blacks during a time when white supremacy and segregation were ways of life. In essence, it was a form of terrorism.
 It’s understandable that Mayor Williams, who identifies as a bi-racial Black man, would react in the harshest way to the word and all it represents. We share his disgust.
 However, Lynch Road has nothing to do with any of that. Lynch is the name of a prominent family with deep roots in Vermilion County. Lynch Road was named countless decades ago to reflect the Lynch family’s longtime land ownership in that area east of Danville. Lynch Road is a heavily traveled roadway with ramps taking traffic on and off Interstate 74.

As one enters the retirement period, a smart allocation of assets is needed to enjoy a regular stream of income. Earlier, a rule of thumb was followed for retirement corpus, which said that the stock part of one’s portfolio should equal 100 minus the retiree’s age. For example, if an investor retires at 60, 40% of his total savings would go to stocks and the rest to bonds.

"It was devastating," said Jeffery Payne, a server in the VIP lounge at Caesars casino. "There was enough anxiety already in life without this back- and-forth. You're ready to go back, and then you don't go. You see the light at the end of the tunnel, and you get the rug pulled out from under you."

The need to listen to those who are offended seems obvious. Sometimes, naturally, people can go overboard. One sports writer recently called for a name change for the Masters, suggesting it made people think of slavery instead of its intended reference as a tournament for the "masters of golf." Seems a bit of a stretch.
 I don't know if Native Americans will accept the Blackhawks' explanation for their decision, and perhaps real debate over the nickname is just beginning. We can't really judge that fine line between respect and disrespect if we're not the ones feeling disrespected.
