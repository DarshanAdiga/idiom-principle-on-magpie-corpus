We need doctors right now. My God, we need doctors: to evaluate the coronavirus’ assault, assess the body’s response and figure out where, in that potentially deadly tumble of events, there’s a chance to intervene.
 We need research scientists. It falls to them to map every last wrinkle of this invader and find its Achilles’ heel.

In Russia, the growth of average daily throughput volumes exceeded 2%, mainly thanks to the Volgograd refinery. Our European facilities also recorded growth of up to 1%, mainly on the back of higher capacity utilization in Italy following the end of maintenance works in the fourth quarter of 2019. This offsets the decrease in the Bulgarian refinery's throughput caused by disruptions of feedstock supply in February due to adverse weather conditions.

Good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation. I have three questions. One relates to gas production in Uzbekistan. Just to follow-up on my colleague could you please explain? The current production is less than the plan. Does that affect the PSA, the Production Sharing Agreement in any way for you to recover your costs? Would the terms be standard and such an Act of God or force majeure taken as is?

Thank you, Pavel. In the first quarter of 2020, the economics of Europe's refining segment greatly improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, despite a decline in demand for motor fuels and lower crack spreads for gasoline. The benchmark margin was up more than 80% quarter-on-quarter on the back of lower feedstock costs coupled with a higher euros discount versus Brent crude as well as relatively high crack spreads for diesel fuel and improved crack spreads for fuel oil. The same drivers contributed to further benchmark margin growth in April. In May, however, there was a drastic change, as the refining margin fell to nearly zero amid oil price recovery and decline in crack spreads for diesel fuel.

In the first quarter we continued delivering a strong performance in cost optimization and control. However conditionally controllable operating and administrative expenses per barrel went down by almost 4% compared to 2019 average. In the current environment, we took additional steps to proceed with cost savings in order to support our financial results in 2020. Our efforts to cover all items of operating and administrative expenses as well as capital expenditures across the board.

We have been taking all the necessary measures from regular testing to extended shift periods for our employees. As a result, we have been able to prevent any major outbreaks at LUKOIL facilities, while ensuring continuity of our business processes across the board. As one example, all of our filling stations continued operating with no disruptions whatsoever.

Our investment program in the quarter was also financed in fall in line with the budget approved for the year. The existing market environment has had a marked negative impact on our financial performance.

Later, he was furloughed and took over some of the child care responsibilities. But now, with the economy reopening, the prospect of being summoned back to campus fills Virginia Dressler with more anxiety: Day care centers are just starting to reopen, with restrictions, so who will take care of their children?
 “All of these things are spinning around in my head,” she said. “We’re trying to come up with plan A, plan B and plan C.”

Roscioli said she would have liked to sentence Garcia immediately following the plea, but must wait for an evaluation that will determine whether he will be classified as a sexually violent predator by the state. Regardless of that designation, Garcia will be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.
 Garcia told the judge he was under the influence of drugs and alcohol when the rape occurred and had initially hoped to plead no contest. Such a plea would mean that while he was not admitting guilt, he was accepting the fact that there was sufficient evidence to convict him of the crime.
 But Roscioli explained that she would not accept a no contest plea for so serious a sexual offense.
 “In sex offense cases, I think it’s important for the defendant to acknowledge what they have done,” the judge said, noting that such an admittance is also necessary for any genuine rehabilitation.

“A month ago, it was nurses, doctors and golf pros and we couldn’t do anything wrong,” he said. “Not so much anymore — back to normal.”
 The principal source of consternation, a concern shared mostly by serious not casual golfers, is new health guidelines that have affected the golf hole itself. In an effort to reduce high-touch surfaces from golfers reaching into holes to retrieve their balls or removing the flagstick, course operators have tried various solutions, including raising the white liner cup, which is normally inserted in the hole, to about 2 inches above the green surface. An approaching ball bounces off the cup liner instead of falling into the hole.
 The United States Golf Association, a national governing body, issued a temporary rule amendment in March that qualified such a situation as a holed shot — with caveats (more on that later).

We realize that protracted mobility restrictions might undermine demand for energy resources in the long run. At the same time, the relatively low oil price is expected after a strong growth driver. Let me also say here that the subdued oil pricing environment is impacting production projects with the lowest efficiencies, which might have a refined influence over the supply and demand balance going forward.

In particular our per unit production costs in the first quarter of 2020 went down by almost 2% compared to the 2019 average on the back of operational efficiency improvement program.
