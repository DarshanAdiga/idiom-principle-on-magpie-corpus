“The one over the hill,” Choate replied, the phrase he often uses to refer to the Grizzlies.
 “What university is it?” Barnum asked again.
 “We don’t get too involved in that,” Choate responded with a smile, never saying the team name. “We want to downplay that. I think people get too excited about that game here in the state of Montana.”
 The ’Cat-Griz rivalry was one of many topics of discussion during the first day of the Big Sky’s kickoff event on Thursday, which included interviews with the conference’s head coaches. It was conducted virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
 Montana State has won its in-state rivalry game four years in a row, the longest consecutive run of wins since the 1970s. Hauck, Montana’s head coach, was short with his response when asked how the Grizzlies could shift the balance of power back to Missoula and away from Bozeman.
 “It’s already done,” Hauck said. “We need to win that game. They kicked our ass last year, and we’re not pleased about it.”
 Hauck returned to Montana two seasons ago. In 2018, the Bobcats came back from a 22-point deficit to win on a last-season goal-line stand. Last year, MSU won 48-14.
 Choate feels his team’s scheme has been simple. Run the ball, he said, and stick to the ground game regardless of the score.
 He hopes the Bobcats can play Montana at some point soon. But uncertainty looms over the 2020 season, as the conference expects to make a decision by the end of the month about whether games will be played this fall.
 To Choate, another game in Missoula “seems like 1,000 miles away.”
 “I hope we get to them, that’s what I hope,” he said. “And if we do, we have a pretty good blueprint for how to take care of them.”

Warren Louis Kammerer Jr. Born to eternal life, July 20, 2020, Saint Charles, Illinois Born on November 6, 1925, Pecatonica, Illinois. Warren is an American success story, a self-made man. He grew up on a humble farm in Pecatonica during the depression. As the eldest son of eight children, he had much responsibility on his shoulders at a young age, which helped establish his hard work ethic. This included many chores in the early morning and evening, all while going to school. He attended a one room schoolhouse, with lard sandwiches for lunch and cast off shoes on his feet. He really did walk a mile plus to school in all types of weather. Exceptionally sharp and intelligent, he skipped two grades. All his life, he was indebted to his aunt who saw his promise. They boarded an old jalopy and chugged down to the University of Illinois, where she helped him enroll. He worked his way through the college, joining the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and earning his B.A. in Business Admin- istration in 1951. (College was interrupted when he enlisted in the Army toward the end of WWII. His eyesight disqualified him at first, but he was so motivated, he fudged the test. His high I.Q. resulted in being chosen for the O.S.S., Counter Intelligence Corps, precursor to the C.I.A. He was stationed in occupied Osaka, Japan.) Warren was a successful businessman. His mantra was to always look and do your best. He began his lifelong career at Firestone, starting in Sales in 1951, culminating with managing his own store in St. Charles, for over 30 years. He married Virginia, his beloved wife of over 50 years, in 1970. They made a terrific team. Warren loved America and had a lifelong interest in politics, being a proud member of the Republican party. He held positions in several civic and governmental committees, including being a delegate for the 1992 Republican National Convention. He was honored to be the first elected Chairman of the Kane County Board (1990-1996), being instrumental in significant infrastructure and financial reforms. He strove for justice and fairness in all endeavors. He was a member of the VFW, Charter member of Kiwanis International, Moose International, National Exchange Club, Playmakers community theater group, and various church committees. Warren was witty, handsome, and charming. He loved photography, dancing, watching sports (especially Illini and Packer football), cars, and car shows. Family was everything to him. You could always count on him attending all his children's performances, concerts and such. He said, "I have so many people depending on me", and he did, and did so willingly. He enjoyed helping those in need. He was one of a kind, and one of the last of the greatest generation. Warren passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by loving family. Warren is survived by Virginia, his beloved wife of over 50 years, children Ann Kammerer, Jill (David) Kammerer, Warren Kammerer III, Stephen Kammerer, Holly (Tom) Regelbrugge, Lauren (William) Pedersen, Jinny Gilgan, Katy (Ryan) Carlson, grandchildren Lana Kammerer, Harry and Samuel Jaffe, great-grandchildren Anyssa Green (and soon, Ethan Carlson), siblings Joan (Robert) Lindquist, Nellie (Willis) Runne, Phyllis (Fred) Peterson.He was preceded in death by his parents, Warren Louis Kammerer Sr. and Lois Amelia (Campbell) Kammerer, siblings, Katherine (Donald) Bradley, Marjorie (Samuel) Castree, James (Joan) Kammerer, Wayne Kammerer, and grandson Eric Kammerer. There will be a private funeral. Interment will be at Hulse Cemetery, Pecatonica, Illinois. Donations in his name can be made to Baker Memorial United Methodist Church, 307 Cedar Ave., St. Charles, IL, 60174

Every successful team needs a special talent and England pace bowler Jofra Archer has the 'X-factor', former West Indies Twenty20 skipper Carlos Brathwaite has said.
 England dropped Barbados-born Archer from the second test against West Indies after he breached COVID-19 bio-security protocols but the 25-year-old could return for the deciding test starting on Friday.
 “There's the traditional English way of doing it by the book, but all good teams need the X-factor. I think he brings that X-factor... Kevin Pietersen brought that X-factor,” Brathwaite told the BBC.
 “While you're hoping that the majority of the team are 75% consistent and they do everything by the book -- they are always early, they eat right, they do this and they do that -- you do need that rogue.
 “I'm not saying that he is that, but every team needs that rogue, that X-factor, that doesn't play by the rules of the book and 'do it my way' type of character.”
 Brathwaite said Archer had the potential to become a leader like Ben Stokes, who captained the side in the opening game against the West Indies in the absence of Joe Root.
 Stokes has had his share of troubles off the pitch, missing the 2017 Ashes series against Australia after sustaining a hand injury in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub before being cleared of affray.
 “If you think about it, Stokes not so long ago, was seen as that type of character. Now he's seen as a leader,” Brathwaite added.
 “If England can find a way to transform Jofra into the leader that Stokes has become, while keeping his X-factor on-field performance, then they are two serious cricketers to be contending with for the next five to 10 years.”

What's the number two item in anyone's toolbox? Well, that would have to be a hammer of course. This Ball Peen Hammer by Tekton features a fiberglass handle to absorb vibrations and an exterior poly jacket to protect the core from when…er…you miss what you're trying to hit. Hey, it happens.
 Ball peen hammers are good first hammers for a few reasons. First, the absence of a claw on the back of the head means fewer chances to hurt yourself. Second, it's lighter than a claw hammer so it's easier to swing. This version is an 8oz hammer; heavy enough to drive some brads or light nails and easy for your kids to use. Larger sizes available at the link if you're up for it.
 It's got a soft and comfortable non-slip grip for a nice feel when you're swinging at some nails. The head is made of forged steel and it's fused to the handle with an epoxy bond which should last for an incredibly long time.

If you're a parent that prefers an overabundance of caution in raising your child, then this review of the AmazonBasics 4-Piece Wood Chisel Set won't be for you. Not to worry, there are plenty of safer tools on our list of Best Tools for Kids. We'll wait to proceed until you move on. No worries.
 Okay, those of you still with me are in for a treat. This set of four well- honed wood chisels is surprisingly good, especially for a beginning woodworker. If you've ever dreamed of crafting a pine derby car with your kid, this might help punch your ticket to the races. Not everyone has access to a bandsaw so wood chisels are really handy for teaching your kid the value of patient craftsmanship as well as how to handle a sharp object safely and confidently.
 Not enough kids get hands-on training with tools growing up, especially sharp ones, so the idea of spending time teaching your little one about how to handle tools like a wood chisel is incredibly unique. As always, use caution around tools and never (ever) let your kid out of your sight with something like a wood chisel. The time you spend now teaching such values as responsibility will pay off enormously in the long run.

You can never have too many clamps. They're great for a myriad of tasks and these one-handed bar clamps from Irwin are simply too good not to have in your workshop. This set of four is perfect to get your kid started down the road of responsible, effective woodworking.
 They feature pads that won't harm the surfaces your kid is working on. The quick-grip design allows anyone to squeeze the trigger, tighten up the seal, and release without worrying that they'll slide off. And with one hand, no less! 140 pounds of force is more than enough to glue up that planter box and hold the sides together.
 Simply put, these are the simplest and most effective clamps ever designed. Your kids will love using them on projects with you and, when they've grown up and off on their adventures, they might leave one or two behind for you to use! Highly recommended.
