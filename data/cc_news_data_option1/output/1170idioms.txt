Crucially, the authorities followed this up with contact-tracing, a key move to identify people who have been in close proximity with COVID-19 patients and to isolate them by imposing a 14-day home quarantine – the incubation period of the virus. Every case is followed up without fail and this has accounted for the relatively low rate of local transmission.

Chairs that are usually filled with hungry customers were stacked carefully on tables March 18 as two employees dashed outside Fiddler's Restaurant to take the orders of customers waiting in their cars.
   
 This has become the norm throughout Jasper County and the state as the coronavirus pandemic has restaurants changing the way they conduct business. Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order last week for all bars and restaurants to close dine-in services in an effort to help stop the virus' spread.
   
 Fiddler's owner Donna Rowell felt the order was coming, so she prepared and began takeout service that day.
   
 "I did takeout yesterday, because I just had that feeling," Rowell said March 18. "I figured I needed to go and figure out how to do it because I had never done it before."
   
 Rowell's restaurant on Main Street in Ridgeland is only steps from the curb and has a small outside dining area that cannot be used for now.
   
 "Tomorrow, I might implement something different and put cones out front so things can keep moving around the building," she said.
   
 As the telephone rang with orders, Rowell said she is taking precautions to protect her employees.
   
 "I do want them to be safe," she said. "We had a self-serve beverage center; we shut that completely down. They are wiping down surfaces every 30 minutes, they have to constantly wash their hands. If anyone has a fever or any other symptoms, they can't work here."
   
 Rowell said as of last week Fiddler's was keeping its normal hours of 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
   
 "Right now, I am just believing that the Lord is going to take care of us and that we are going to be able to pay our bills and keep everybody employed in some way, somehow," she said. "I will take this day by day and not live in fear."
   
 Speaking to a customer outside his restaurant next to Interstate 95, Randy Horton watched as one of his employees delivered takeout to a vehicle. He decided that March 18 would be his last day of operations until the pandemic ends.
   
 "Today is the first day for takeout and today is the last day of our business until they say it's OK to open back up the dining room," he said standing outside Pizza Bella in Ridgeland. "It's a family-run business and having people come in that I don't know, so we are going to just play it safe and wait until they say it is safe to reopen."
   
 Ronak Patel operates several businesses in Hardeeville and Okatie, including a food mart, liquor store and gas station. He said Thursday night his sales remained "fairly decent."
   
 "The locals always give us phenomenal support," he said. "There has not been too much change in traffic, especially the ones coming in who are traveling."
   
 Patel said he was well stocked at all of his businesses in preparation for any delays that might happen.
   
 "I am fully stocked for weeks just in case we have distribution come to a halt," he said.
   
 Patel said he expected he would have to cut hours or let go some of his part- time staff because of the pandemic. He said his full-time employees would continue to be paid, even in a complete shutdown.
   
 "They will not have to worry about anything through this crisis," he said. "My company is always there for my long-term invested employees."
   
 Sarfaraz Memon recently traveled around Hardeeville passing out flyers for his new restaurant, #Hashtag Bistro. The restaurant at Quality Inn and Suites opened its doors about a week earlier.
   
 "I'm feeling bad, I'm hurting, it is hurting my business," Memon said of the pandemic's impact. "I have all of my stuff here. I have utility bills and one customer all day."
   
 Memon said he had to send his five staff members home.
   
 "This virus has hit us hard," he said. "I am self-managing the business right now."
   
 To help his business continue, Memon said he is offering free delivery in Hardeeville and Bluffton. He is also offering a discount if customers check in on social media with a hashtag for the restaurant.
   
 "It was some terrible luck that this happened right after I opened the restaurant and I will need local and surrounding support to keep operating," he said.
   
 Jasper County Chamber of Commerce president Kendall Malphrus said the organization is working with businesses through the situation.
   
 "We have been calling members most of the day to find out what and/or if any plans have been made or changed to accommodate guidelines set by our leaders," Malphrus said. "Any information is then passed along via eblast, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, etc."
   
 Malphrus said the most important way residents can help local businesses is to continue to use their services.
   
 "Order out and pick up breakfast, lunch or dinner," she said. "Shop locally for all your wants and needs. Even if you don't need something now, buy a gift certificate for later. Anything we can possibly do to help the businesses get through these trying times, we will do. That is what we are here for."

For businesses, the union government should think of delaying GST payments, tax credits, and any other policy that could support employers to keep their staff on board. As on March 24, the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman has announced a few measures to ease the compliance and regulatory burden for businesses: increasing the threshold of default that triggers the insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings from 1 lakh to 1 crore, easing some of the rules for corporate affairs, and extending the deadline to pay excise and customs duty and GST. Government should ensure that the flow of critical supplies and services are uninterrupted, including food, healthcare, security, groceries and other provisions, electricity, telecom, ATMs and banking.

“Every time your brain starts talking to you, just invite yourself to kindly observe [instead],” Christie said. “Look at the trees. Look at the ground. Breathe the air. Focus on the senses rather than the words. It’s not easy, and so if you do it for 10 seconds and start thinking again, that’s OK. Also, some days it’ll come easy, and some days it’ll be really hard. We know we can’t turn on and off our emotions or what’s going on, but I think trying and giving yourself permission is really important. If the first day isn’t successful, go out on another day.”

They do come naturally. After doing this for some time the one factor you take a look at to do once in a while is take a look at to make a undeniable voice distinct from one thing else; so, they do not all sound the similar. I'll do an impact of my dad, and it is so him that I take a look at to stay that exclusively-that voice to be his. Sometimes, I'll be speaking about any person else, and I'll be like, "Oh I feel like I'm sounding like my dad." I do take a look at to transfer it up.

En Madrid, la ciudad española más golpeada por el COVID-19, la ONG Gastronomía Solidaria reúne ya a 200 cocineros voluntarios a disposición del Ayuntamiento para dar de comer a los sanitarios desplazados al hospital abierto en el recinto ferial Ifema "y a quienes haga falta", dicen a Efe.
 También en la capital se ha puesto en marcha Food4Heroes, con la que restaurantes como Honest Greens, Grosso Napoletano, Tierra Burritos o Manolitos Bakery llevan comida a personal hospitalario.
 E incluso los "cocinillas" aficionados se organizan en redes sociales para llevar sus tarteras a los centros sanitarios más próximos a sus domicilios, idea que intenta aunar el emprendedor y exdirector de Terra Juanjo Amorín bajo la etiqueta #YoTeCocino.
 En Barcelona, el movimiento HealthWarriors cuenta ya con medio centenar de establecimientos donde se preparan comidas y cenas que se entregan de forma gratuita al personal que trabaja en hospitales. Responden a la llamada de Francesc Terns que, con sus dos negocios de comida a domicilio cerrados y las neveras llenas comenzó solo, "con sus manitas y su coche".
 Así lo explica a Efe Nacho Ballesta, quien con su empresa de comunicación The Foodtellers ha conseguido amplificar la campaña a través de las redes sociales. Los receptores de los menús están "encantados", asegura.
 "El segundo escalón es acceder a una cocina de producción para alimentar a personas necesitadas, creando un gran comedor social, pero en la casa de cada uno. Y el siguiente, buscar una red logística para implementar la idea en cualquier lugar de España", añade.
 José Campoviejo, con una estrella Michelin en El Corral del Indianu (Asturias), cumplió este lunes 51 años y lo celebró cocinando de forma altruista para 70 niños sin recursos de su pueblo, Arriondas. "Fue el cumpleaños más feliz de mi vida", confiesa a Efe.
 Con el restaurante cerrado, decidió no quedarse de brazos cruzados y consiguió que le dejaran las cocinas del colegio público y que Cáritas y el Ayuntamiento le pasaran un listado de quienes necesitan de su labor. Los alimentos fueron llegando gracias a su llamamiento a través de las redes sociales y ya tiene "para hacer comidas para más de 20 días".
 Elabora a diario desayunos, comidas y cenas -ensalada de pasta, arroz estofado con setas y pollo, escalope empanado, tortilla de patatas, melón, leche, pan, galletas, yogures- que el servicio de asistencia social reparte entre las familias desfavorecidas.
 "Mi llamamiento es ahora para extenderlo a toda Asturias", dice un cocinero que lanza una crítica a algunos de sus compañeros: "Verles subiendo a redes fotos de chuletones y recetas complicadas me entristece. No es el momento porque hay muchas neveras vacías. No es el momento de posturear, sino de ayudar".
 En Zaragoza, la hostelería local ha activado "Gastroaplausos" para elaborar cenas para el personal del Hospital Miguel Servet y del Clínico, y por el momento ya cuentan con restaurantes como La Mafia, Ginger Fizz Bar, La tradicional, La Mostaza, Bronson, Peppone y Pizza Mia, aunque el objetivo es seguir creciendo.
 En Francia, el chef del Palacio del Elíseo, Guillaume Gómez, ha logrado ya reunir a más de 200 cocineros -varios con estrellas Michelin- y empresas de alimentación y logística para dar de comer al personal sanitario civil y militar de todo el país.
 Se trata de la campaña "Les chefs avec les soignants" (los cocineros con los cuidadores), lanzada a través de redes sociales y por la cada día reparten menús a trabajadores de hospitales para darles fuerzas y la alimentación necesaria en su empeño bajo el lema "ocupaos vosotros de nosotros, nosotros nos ocupados de vosotros".
 En una Italia también duramente golpeada por el COVID-19, son los cocineros más conocidos quienes, con sus restaurantes cerrados, vuelven a vestir sus chaquetillas para otro público.
 El mediático Carlo Cracco dio de comer al personal que construye el hospital de campaña de la Feria de Milán, los hermanos Chicco e Bobo Cerea, del 'triestrellado' Da Vittorio cocinaron para el hospital instalado en la Feria de Bérgamo, y algunos de los más prestigiosos de Roma lo han hecho para el hospital de enfermedades infecciosas Spallanzani.
 Además, el español afincado en Estados Unidos José Andrés ha puesto en marcha la maquinaria de su fundación World Central Kitchen para alimentar desde pasajeros en cuarentena de un crucero a barrios enteros habitados por personas desfavorecidas, como ya hizo en otras crisis humanitarias.

El diez de abril de 1948 se firmaba la Declaración Universal de los Derechos Humanos, habían pasado tres años desde que la entrada del Ejército Rojo en Berlín había puesto fin a la II Guerra Mundial. Después de una época espantosa para la historia de la humanidad, la conciencia de la sociedad había generado nuevos consensos tras sufrir en sus propias carnes la barbarie que había supuesto el fascismo. El artículo uno dice así: "Todos los seres humanos nacen libres e iguales en dignidad y derechos y, dotados como están de razón y conciencia, deben comportarse fraternalmente los unos con los otros".
 Ahora mismo la humanidad en su conjunto se enfrenta a uno de los mayores retos de toda su historia. Esta pandemia global está sacando a la luz las diferentes formas de afrontar el problema por cada país y modelo de sociedad, mientras EEUU y Reino Unido están poniendo la economía por encima de la vida humana, Cuba y China envían médicos especialistas al Norte de Italia.

Le coronavirus provoque chez les patients une maladie pulmonaire dont la gravité peut varier. Dans les cas les plus graves, les patients deviennent incapables de respirer seuls et ont besoin de l'aide d'un respirateur artificiel, le temps de guérir. À mesure que l'épidémie prend de l'ampleur chez nous, il est à craindre que le nombre de machines à disposition des hôpitaux soit insuffisant.Au CHC Montlégia, la phase 1 de gestion de crise est déclenchée. "Aujourd'hui, nous avons une capacité de 100 lits ventilés, nous explique Philippe Olivier, directeur médical. C'est trois fois plus qu'avant le déménagement (le site vient d'être inauguré) et deux fois plus que ce que le Montlégia est capable d'accueillir en temps normal", détaille-t-il. La deuxième phase de gestion commencera lorsque cette capacité sera dépassée. "Il nous faudrait alors 60 à 70 lits supplémentaires, explique Philippe Olivier. À ce moment-là, nous aurons besoin de davantage de respirateurs. Parallèlement au manque de respirateur, nous aurons rapidement une pénurie de pièces mécaniques qui font partie des respirateurs et qui doivent être changées entre chaque patient", ajoute Philippe Olivier. "La semaine passée, j'ai contacté Philippe Olivier, qui est mon ancien chef scout, pour savoir s'il avait besoin de quelque chose à l'hôpital, nous raconte André Bertin, directeur de Coexpair, une PME active dans l'aéronautique à Namur. Quelques heures plus tard, nous nous nous sommes retrouvés au CHC pour évaluer les besoins en machine et voir ce qu'il était possible de faire". C'est alors que le projet a été lancé et qu'une grande chaine de solidarité s'est mise en place. "J'ai commencé par appeler les PME wallonnes avec lesquelles j'ai l'habitude de travailler, comme Citius-Ciseo à Liège qui a rapidement répondu présent", explique André Bertin. "Les patrons de PME sont des personnes qui ont créé leur propre entreprise et qui ont donc une capacité de réaction très rapide, explique-t-il. Ensuite, de plus grandes entreprises nous ont rejoints comme Safran Aero Boosters, la Sonaca, la Sabca, la FN Herstal, etc.".Le problème de pénurie de pièces de rechange est lié au fait que tous les hôpitaux du monde en achètent beaucoup en même temps pour les stocker de peur d'en manquer. C'est un peu le même problème qu'avec les gens qui achètent beaucoup plus de papier toilette qu'en temps normal. Fondamentalement, on n'en manque pas. Mais le marché est asséché à cause des gens qui achètent de grosses quantités. "Notre but est aujourd'hui de fabriquer beaucoup de ces pièces de rechange pour calmer le marcher, affirme André Bertin. L'idée est que les hôpitaux puissent stocker nos pièces, utiliser les pièces d'origine et avec un peu de chance, ne jamais avoir besoin de nos pièces", espère-t-il. Grâce à ce réseau d'ingénieurs wallons, les premières pièces de rechange pour les respirateurs ont pu être produites ce lundi en fin de matinée. Il aura donc fallu quelques jours aux industriels wallons pour résoudre ce premier problème. "Maintenant on multiplie la production pour approvisionner le marché", affirme André Bertin. Concernant la production de respirateur, le réseau fonctionne également à pleine vitesse. Le projet a à sa disposition les connaissances de 5000 personnes. Actuellement, entre 100 et 300 ingénieurs travaillent à sa réalisation. Interpellées par leurs hôpitaux, ce sont les universités qui ont commencé à se pencher en premier lieu sur le problème. Certaines d'entre elles ont déjà réussi à réaliser un prototype qui fonctionne. "Notre travail consiste maintenant à reprendre leur plan et à réussir à industrialiser le processus pour créer une vraie machine qui peut être produite en nombre", explique André Bertin qui espère que la première machine sera opérationnelle d'ici quelques jours. "Au lancement du projet, nous nous sommes donné l'objectif de dix jours. C'est une course contre la montre", commente-t-il.Il tient à le souligner, "tout le monde travaille gratuitement et personne ne regarde à la dépense", selon le directeur de Coexpair. "La chaine de solidarité qui vient d'être créée entre tous les industriels wallons est vraiment extraordinaire et très efficace. Toutes les barrières sont tombées. Les questions d'argent seront réglées plus tard, l'urgence est ailleurs", dit- il.Cette manière inédite de répondre à la crise met en lumière le savoir-faire de nos industriels wallons. Cela va-t-il pour autant amener le secteur de la santé à changer ses filières d'approvisionnements pour devenir plus résilient en cas de nouvelle pandémie ? "Une réflexion est en cours sur le système actuel, nous confie Philippe Olivier. Mais allons-nous pour autant produire des respirateurs en Belgique ? Je ne le sais pas. Les industriels veulent aujourd'hui rendre service à la société. Il faudra voir s'ils trouvent un intérêt à produire ce genre de machines à l'avenir"."On peut néanmoins espérer que cette crise change le système, car on s'est quand même rendu compte qu'il était peu résilient. On n'a pas de Plan B en Belgique, déplore Philippe Olivier. Bien que, se corrige-t-il, l'industrie wallonne nous prouve aujourd'hui sa capacité de réaction et d'adaptation." Mais ce qui va changer à coup sûr, selon le directeur médical, "c'est notre regard sur le coût du matériel médical. Nous allons bientôt avoir accès à des respirateurs à bas coûts. Ça va changer le marché. Nous allons mesurer l'écart entre les prix catalogue et les coûts de production".Attention toutefois, prévient André Bertin, il ne faut pas confondre les coûts de production avec le prix d'une machine certifiée. "Une grande partie du coût de production d'une machine provient de sa certification. Dans le secteur de l'aéronautique, nous travaillons avec des normes très exigeantes. Si vous mettez dans votre voiture la même pièce que dans un avion, celle de l'avion coûtera trois fois plus cher parce qu'elle a été certifiée et qu'on est certain à 100 % qu'elle est conforme et qu'elle fonctionne", nous explique-t-il. "C'est pareil dans le domaine médical. Une pièce certifiée a beaucoup plus de valeur et c'est normal".S'il n'est pas certain que l'industrie wallonne se réoriente une fois la crise passée, André Bertin décèle déjà que le monde en général, mais également celui de l'industrie sortira changé de cette expérience. "On voit autour de nous une solidarité et de l'entraide. C'est bien plus gratifiant que tout ce qu'on pourra accomplir. La solidarité dans notre secteur et la motivation pour réussir ce projet sont énormes", se réjouit-il. "En fin de compte, on espère que tout ça ne servira à rien et que le nombre de respirateurs est déjà suffisant. Et si on a l'air ridicule d'avoir fait tout ça, au moins le ridicule ne tue pas".

WASHINGTON, D.C. (WJLA/CNN) - A doctor at George Washington University Hospital wants everyone to know exactly how COVID-19 can damage your lungs.He created a virtual rendering of lungs from an actual patient being treated at the hospital, and he thinks it has a powerful message for the public.“So we can see it front to back, side to side...” said Dr. Keith Mortman,chief of thoracic surgery. “This patient is a gentleman in his late 50s, who initially had a fever and a non-productive cough like many other people. Respiratory symptoms progressed quite rapidly, to the point where he did need to be intubated and put on the ventilator."A virtual reality, 360-degree rendering, shows exactly what the virus does to the human body.“So what you’re seeing in the video, essentially the blue part is the more normal lung, but anything you’re seeing yellow is lung that’s being destroyed by the virus,” Mortman said.In partnership with a company called Surgical Theater, he used a coronavirus patient’s CAT scan to create an interactive model.“It’s quite alarming to see, in all honesty, because unlike your garden-variety pneumonia that might affect only one small part of the lung or unlike the common flu, what you’re seeing in this video is really the widespread, diffuse damage to the lung.”Mortman’s hope is that the technology can help medical professionals on the front lines, but he also wants members of the public to see these images for themselves.This perspective should open everyone’s eyes to the dangers of COVID-19, he said.“I really want them to be able to see this and to really understand the damage that’s being done to the lungs, the severity of the disease that this is causing, so perhaps, maybe they think twice before having a house party or going outside to large groups,” Mortman said.He said COVID-19 is a community problem, and it’s going to take a community effort to solve it.Copyright 2020 WJLA via CNN.

The tragedy, however, is that the coronavirus has moved from the trader’s screens to the real economy. India is a country that largely relies on consumption driven growth and service sector jobs. Both of these, unfortunately, are the first targets of the virus. People have massively clamped down on spending – they are urged not to go out. As the spending decreases, businesses will feel the pinch and will have to either close down or operate at minimum capacity. This would necessarily mean loss of jobs, at a time when labour force participation rate and the unemployment levels in the country were already unhealthily high for an emerging market.

Schuller's group isn't just curious about meteorites- they're seeking superconductivity anywhere. 6 years ago, his team debuted a strategy called magnetic field regulated microwave spectroscopy (MFMMS). The MFMMS technique starts with researchers putting small example pieces into a tooth cavity loaded with microwaves and an oscillating magnetic field and after that cooling it. When samples transition from conductors to superconductors, the method they take in microwaves significantly modifications. The MFMMS technique enables researchers to swiftly check via lots of products to identify whether or not they are superconductors.

Mainieri said that freshman right-hander Alex Lange will start Friday's game on the mound for the Tigers after sitting out last weekend's series versus Auburn with tightness in his arm. Lange is 6-0 on the year, and he leads the SEC with a 1.39 ERA.      LSU leads the SEC with a .319 team batting average, and the Tigers have launched 36 home runs, just five shy of the 41 they hit for the entire 2014 season. LSU also has 65 stolen bases, already 16 more than the 49 steals it had in all of 2014.
