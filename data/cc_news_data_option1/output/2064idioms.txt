AMD didn't need to lock overclocking on their recent chips : they are already pushed so close to the max, pushing them any further usually doesn't get you too far, and for the few chips they lock down (entry level Athlon CPUs) it's rather easily worked around (and it's quite telling that they didn't bother to fix it in their latest iterations). Still, even at a time when AMD was leading in performance (Athlon64), outside of a locked multiplier they really had nothing against overclocking (a 1600 MHz Sempron64 getting a 800MHz OC with its box cooler on a cheapo motherboard is SWEET - so is the 2.6 GHz Athlon II X4 620 getting pushed to 3.4 GHz on air).

The authors draw the reader into a world that is at once familiar, and yet near-dystopian. The trials of life, raising children, providing for a family and ultimately doing one’s duty are set against a backdrop of immense economic dislocation and social unrest. Throughout the book we are given glimpses into a future America that on some level shows the hope and promise of technology and how it can empower lives. At the same time, the dislocation caused by automation in many cases replaces human decision-making with algorithms, and is brought home to the reader in Keegan’s strained relationship with her husband Jared, whose promising law career has been cut short. The reader can sense the tension and bitterness as Jared had been reduced to a virtual reality “gig economy” to help the family make ends meet. Their young daughter Haley becomes both the anchor for the couple and the bridge between the family and this new way of life.

 However, you are very wrong on Amazon, it is a juggernaut, the only way is up barring Government intervention, it will likely be the first $2T company. It has triumphed during the lockdown which will only attract greater use; it has built the best logistics business on the planet; AWS is a monster in itself and a world leader in its field; voice and smart home is growing and has huge potential expansion and Alexa is way out in front; Prime is a huge recurring revenue business for them, and Music/Video has a firm foothold in what will be the new market of on-demand entertainment as broadcast TV withers on the vine (they are also looking at adding cinemas as a complimentary offering). Dont be surprised to see them move into live sports in bigger way; One of the fastest growing sectors for them is media and advertising revenue, and they can leverage this against the massive consumer database of product and buying habits; They are moving into health care and this is one of the biggest markets in the US economy.

My magnum opus was converting a ten-thousand line Cobol program with 32 input files, 855 goto statements and two internal sorts into a structured program. Credit goes to debug tracing under Microfocus Cobol and Diff on the IBM mainframe that I used to verify that three months of inputs through my replacement gave identical results to the original maintenance nightmare. The original programmers two decades earlier were given an ultimatum of producing the program in a month or all being fired. A real world application of the mythical man month in that the narcissistic CEO given a six month timeline added six times the staff and gave the one month ultimatum. Kudos to the ones who worked night and day and got it done. Nightmares for everyone who had to fix or enhance it years later. But that is what my BSCS degree taught me to deal with. I haven't used Cobol in 30 years but still know IMS and DB2 SQL along with JES2 for job control on an IBM mainframe. Does NJ really need retired programmers, in my case having risen to Sr Staff Analyst level? If they have Microfocus Cobol I would really be tempted. Easytrieve Plus would be the icing on the cake but report writer was still okay. And I'd hope they have a great sort and date conversion library.

BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon's prime minister visited United Nations peacekeepers in the country's south near the border with Israel on Wednesday, describing the presence of the force in the volatile area as a necessity. The visit by Prime Minister Hassan Diab comes amid the backdrop of a war of words between Israeli and Lebanese officials, including the powerful Hezbollah group, over the mandate of the U.N. force, known as UNIFIL. The force has been deployed in southern Lebanon since an Israeli invasion in 1978. Israel is calling for major changes in the way the mission in southern Lebanon operates on the ground, demanding that it have access to all sites and freedom of movement and that it report back to the Security Council if it is being blocked. The head of Lebanon's Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, said late Tuesday that Lebanon will not accept a change of mandate for UNIFIL to allow it to raid and search areas, calling it a violation of the country's sovereignty. Nasrallah said the U.S. is pressuring Lebanon to accept such a change. “They want to reduce UNIFIL numbers? Go ahead. Increase them? Go ahead,” Nasrallah said, adding if they also want to leave it will be no problem. “But we consider expanding its mandate an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty.” Diab said the presence of the troops was “necessary and urgent” in light of the ongoing \"violations by Israel of Lebanon’s sovereignty by land, sea and air.” The quibble over the UNIFIL mandate comes up every year before the mandate is renewed in the summer. The peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon was originally created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after the 1978 invasion. The mission was expanded after a 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah militants so that peacekeepers...
