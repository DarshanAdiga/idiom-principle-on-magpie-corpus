In 1999, the Senators were about to begin the most successful stretch in the history of their club. Standing in the way that season were the Buffalo Sabres, who were also in the midst of a very successful stretch. With future Senator and Hall-of-Fame goalie Dominik Hasek manning the net, Buffalo was a force to be reckoned with. The Sens had the better season, but the Sabres were able to handle them with relative ease, dispatching them in a four-game sweep.

Last week the people and critters at Casa De Roe watched such a film. From 2012, it is called "House of Ghosts." Billed as a homage to schlock Director William Castle (House on Haunted Hill, 13 Ghosts, Rosemary's Baby), the film went so far as to shoot the movie in black and white.

From the 50's and 60's the new homes built almost always came with a shingled roof. That was a sign of the times and kind of a status symbol. But over the last decade I have noticed more and more new homes being roofed with metal roofing. No they aren't in aluminum but in a variety of colors. They of course cost more but it is promised to last very long. (What a surprise as I think so did the corrugated ones of the past did.)

“When they’re out of here, that’s been the most danger. The numbers game becomes much more difficult anyway you slice it when the students all get back to campus, like what’s happening with our university right now. Do I regret it at the end of the day? I know why we made the decision. Our players and our staff, when we’re out of this facility, have got to do a great job, whether it’s a two-day break or whether we’re just out there for a night and back in the morning.

This week my husband and I started playing with a large smoker we were given as a wedding present. This was about the third time we have used it and we are still grasping the concept of timing. What we have thought would cook in eight hours has resulted in much longer lengths of time. But we are determined. I will save those details for a later story. But in the meantime, thank goodness for the sides. The two hour late dinner did not have any meat. That came another four hours later. But it did have the most delicious sides. We plotted the sides enthusiastically, potato salad, baked beans, corn, cucumbers, the list went on and on. But the first side we knew we wanted was a slaw. Someone had made the suggestion to try making a broccoli slaw, and I'm so glad they did. We snacked on this all day. By the time the pork shoulder came off of the smoker I barely ate any of it. I still managed to have a few bites.

Of course I am speaking of metal roofs. I grew up in an old brick farm house that was way past one hundred years in age and the roof was one made of corrugated metal. There were thirteen buildings on our farm including the house and they all were made of corrugated roofing. (That is a lot of aluminum to look at on a sunny day.) But something that does come to mind was on the days when it rained. Since my room was on the second floor I was closer to the constant beat of the rain beating on the metal. Many songs speak of the rhythm of the rain and the just how nice it was to listen to. The truth is that they are all correct.

The Senators went up two goals early in the second period on goals from Mark Stone and Jean-Gabriel Pageau, but things began to unravel soon after. By the end of the period, the Bruins had tied up the game on goals by David Pastrnak and Sean Kuraly. When the score remained tied after the third, they entered the first of their two overtime periods.
