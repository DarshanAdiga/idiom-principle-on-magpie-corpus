A proud graduate of Centennial High School and member of its hall of fame, Mike Sexton has been lobbying for the inclusion of the Centennial High School Historic Museum and Gateway to the Legacy of Education Courtyard in the design of the new school Centennial school building.
   
 A similar request for preservation of the museum was presented to the Pueblo School District 60 board of education by Centennial graduate Vickie Moreschini-Rowland.
   
 As the new Centennial and East high schools will share the same floor plan, neither design includes space for a museum and/or courtyard. Additionally, bond funds were not earmarked for construction of such features.
   
 Speaking for the Centennial High School Foundation Board, Sexton has expressed concerns that "multiple requests to include the existing museum and courtyard into the design of the new Centennial building" have not been addressed by the district.
   
 The courtyard includes a throwback facade that leads into the museum, as well as a veterans wall. In all, the project represents more than a quarter of a million dollars in donated time, services and cash.
   
 But if plans for a new Centennial do not account for that museum and courtyard, Sexton said "more than 140 years of history, tradition and legacy will be lost."
   
 Sexton, who addressed the D60 board virtually during its regular August meeting, said the proposed "simple display cases" to house the artifacts and mementos will fall far short in replicating the expansive museum.
   
 East High School is home to the Heritage Hall, a complex constructed in the center courtyard near the front entrance to the school.
   
 A project of the East High School Alumni Foundation, the museum houses memorabilia, artifacts and photos from the school's 50-year history.
   
 In a statement, the district said it remains "very conscientious of the importance of embracing the historical significance and spirit of each school's upbringing."
   
 As design of the new Centennial and East moves forward, plans call for establishment of "a community use room adjacent to the main entryway as a prime space to display historical memorabilia. The room will be highly visible with glass walls and display cases to prominently feature significant awards and achievements."
   
 Acknowledging that these community use rooms cannot replicate Centennial's ornate courtyard and museum, the district said it plans to honor the spirit of the bond passed in 2019 by using funds to "maximize the learning space and educational opportunities for students."
   
 But should alumni foundations at Centennial and East wish to establish new museums on the school grounds, the district said it has "identified land to allow for the expansion."
   
 Centennial also hosts the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium. And while relocation was not included in the bond program, district officials are researching cost and attendance history to determine the viability of relocation.

DETROIT (AP) — The Chicago Bears and Detroit Lions will kick off their seasons in the Motor City, desperately hoping to bounce back from disappointment.
 Chicago’s quest seems a little less challenging.
 The Bears did win eight games last year, but missed the playoffs for the eighth time in nine years. Chicago failed to follow up successfully on coach Matt Nagy’s debut season in which he led the franchise to 12 wins and the NFC North title. A shaky offense, ranked No. 29 in the league, was the the Bears' biggest problem.
 Quarterback Mitchell Trubisky will have a chance to turn around the offense after holding off 2018 Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles to keep his job.
 Nagy insisted he won’t be itching to make a change under center, but will if Trubisky isn’t helping the team score touchdowns.
 “If that time ever comes down the road, it comes, but our focus isn’t there,” Nagy said.
 The Lions, meanwhile, closed 2019 with nine straight setbacks to finish with three victories in the franchise’s worst season in a decade. And if general manager Bob Quinn and coach Matt Patrica don't at least help the team contend for a spot in the playoffs, they probably won't be back in 2021.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — When Jimmy Garoppolo was last seen on the football field he was missing Emmanuel Sanders on a deep pass for a potential go-ahead score in what turned out to be a painful fourth-quarter Super Bowl collapse.
 Those final few minutes put a damper on what had been a mostly successful first full season as a starting quarterback for Garoppolo. It also raised questions in some quarters about whether Garoppolo was the long-term answer for the San Francisco 49ers.
 The poor finish to the Super Bowl after throwing only eight passes in the NFC title game was followed by the Niners considering making a run at Tom Brady in free agency.
 But coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch decided Garoppolo was the best option in a move his teammates have vocally backed all offseason whenever anyone dared criticize their quarterback.
 “How dare you doubt my dude like that. You’re crazy,” guard Laken Tomlinson said. “Come on man. You see him out there doing his thing. Come on man. You can’t do that. That’s my dog. … Jimmy is a leader to all of us out there. It’s all nonsense. It’s all just talk.”
 Garoppolo did plenty to earn that respect as one of only two quarterbacks to rank in the top five in the league last year in TD passes and yards per attempt.

SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — When Jimmy Garoppolo was last seen on the football field he was missing Emmanuel Sanders on a deep pass for a potential go-ahead score in what turned out to be a painful fourth-quarter Super Bowl collapse. Those final few minutes put a damper on what had been a mostly successful first full season as a starting quarterback for Garoppolo. It also raised questions in some quarters about whether Garoppolo was the long-term answer for the San Francisco 49ers. The poor finish to the Super Bowl after throwing only eight passes in the NFC title game was followed by the Niners considering making a run at Tom Brady in free agency. But coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch decided Garoppolo was the best option in a move his teammates have vocally backed all offseason whenever anyone dared criticize their quarterback. “How dare you doubt my dude like that. You’re crazy,” guard Laken Tomlinson said. “Come on man. You see him out there doing his thing. Come on man. You can’t do that. That’s my dog. ... Jimmy is a leader to all of us out there. It’s all nonsense. It’s all just talk.” Garoppolo did plenty to earn that respect as one of only two quarterbacks to rank in the top five in the league last year in TD passes and yards per attempt. He threw for 3,978 yards and 27 touchdowns last season, helping the Niners win 13 games thanks to four fourth-quarter comebacks and rank second in the NFL with an average of 29.9 points per game. He didn’t need to do much in the first two playoff wins when the 49ers dominated on the ground but played well for most of the Super Bowl. He completed 18 of his first 21 passes in three-plus quarters to stake the Niners to a 20-10 lead over Kansas City. But he went just 2 for 10 down the...

First and foremost, Thank you. Thank you to each and every individual who has prayed for me, thought of me, sent me their love and has showered me with their support. In this present moment, it is my only responsibility to be real with myself and to be real with the ones who truly love me and care for my healing. I have without fail, shared with you my brightest days, and I know that sharing with you what has been my darkest will be the light for any man or woman who is feeling the same defeat I felt just only a week ago. Every one of us has a desire, whether small or big, to make it out of where we come from to an ideal future place that includes, freedom to be who we choose, security for our children and families, and fortune to share with the ones we love. We believe these things can co-exist with just being happy. I believed that, that as a black woman, as an artist, an influence, a personality I could shape my world, and with whom I believed to be my partners, they could help me share my world. Over the past 11 years there were promises made to protect and portray my story, with the authenticity and honesty I gave. I was betrayed, taken advantage of, overworked, and underpaid. I wrote a letter over 2 months ago asking to be freed from what I believed was excessive and unfair. I explained in personal detail the demise I was experiencing. My cry for help went totally ignored. However the demands persisted. It was my spirit, and my soul that was tainted the most. There are a few things I count on most to be, a good mother, a good daughter, a good partner, a good sister, and a good person. Who I was, begun to mean little to nothing, because it would only be how I was portrayed on television that would matter. It was witnessing the slow death of the woman I became, that discouraged my will to fight. I felt like I was no longer living, I was existing for the purpose of a corporations gain and ratings, and that killed me. Mental illness is real. We have to normalize acknowledging it and stop associating it with shame and humiliation. The pain that I have experienced over the past 11 years has slowly ate away at my spirit and my mental.

According to prosecutors' notes, Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker told prosecutors that absent other apparent causes of death, it “could be acceptable” to rule the death an overdose, based on the level of fentanyl in Floyd's system. A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family concluded he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression.

Chauvin is slated to make his first in-person court appearance at Friday's hearing. Since his arrest May 29, he has attended all hearings remotely from a state prison where he is being held on a minimum $1 million bail. He is the only officer charged in the case who is still jailed.
 Lawyers for Kueng and Lane, rookies who had been on the force for less than a week at the time of Floyd's death, have argued that their clients were following orders from Chauvin, a 19-year-veteran of the department who had been Kueng's field training officer and informally advised Lane during his probation period.
 Lane, who was holding Floyd's legs, twice asked Chauvin whether they should reposition Floyd — requests that his lawyer says prove that he tried to intervene with a senior officer but was rebuffed. After Floyd appeared to have stopped moving, Lane told Chauvin he was worried about "excited delirium," citing a term used by medical examiners to describe the sudden in-custody death of people who might be under the influence of drugs or who are in an agitated state.
 "That's why we got the ambulance coming," Chauvin told him.
 "OK, I suppose," Lane replied.
 Lawyers for all four former officers have suggested in recent court filings that they plan to argue that Floyd's death was accelerated by drugs in his system — including what the Hennepin County medical examiner told prosecutors in June was a potentially lethal amount of fentanyl, according to recently disclosed interview notes filed as evidence in the case.
 Kueng's lawyer, Thomas Plunkett, wrote in a court filing this week that his client, who was restraining Floyd's back, was only on his third shift as a police officer that day and that he had spent approximately 420 of his 730 hours of field training "being taught and evaluated by Chauvin," whom he was required to call "sir."
 Plunkett suggested he plans to introduce evidence of how Chauvin trained Kueng — including "past opinions and directions" and "past statements he has made about how to handle a subject being detained," which he wrote would be "derogatory" to Chauvin's defense.
