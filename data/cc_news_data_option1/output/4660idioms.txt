In a "perfect world" that would mean people wear an N95 while they're out and about, according to Dr. Whelan.
 So, what is an N95 compared to a surgical mask?
 Like cloth masks, surgical masks primarily protect the people around you from your spittle and gives you some protection from theirs.
 N95s, on the other hand, "reduce wearer’s exposure to particles including small particle aerosols and large droplets," according to a CDC infographic.
 While N95 filtering facepiece respirators "filter out at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles," the SARS-COV-2 virus is smaller than that. However, as USA Today reported in June, the virus "is always bonded to something larger."
 That "something larger" is stuff like water and mucus; things that the N95 will filter out.
 The downside to an N95 compared to masks is that it needs to fit you properly and you have to check the seal every time you put it on.
 There are hundreds, if not thousands of N95s now available on the market and approved by the CDC.
 Others, like the CastleGrade G-Series (you may have seen the ads on your social media channels), are waiting to pass that final hurdle.
 The G-series is a silicone reusable respirator that the company says has passed N95 testing but is waiting on CDC approval.
 Most N95s are not meant to be reusable; that is the upside to cloth masks—you can wash and reuse them. N95s can also be harder to breathe in, and the CDC says they may not be for everybody.

What happens when a rivalry dies?
 Does it cease once the hate dissolves into perfunctory pleasantries? Does it cede back into the schedule like any other game once the history that first gave the series meaning grows distant? Does it dull the moment when one team fails to maintain its competitive edge?
 We may soon find out.
 Should the heavily favored Ravens wallop the Patriots as expected Sunday night, it will have been four long years since the Pats beat them. It could be two more seasons before Bill Belichick and Co. get their next shot. Based on the NFL’s current standings, the Patriots are unlikely to play Baltimore until 2022.
 Therefore, Sunday’s stakes contain more than the Pats’ dying playoff hopes and their professional pride. If they lose, those will sink and take one of the NFL’s fiercest, fading rivalries with them.
 Over the past decade, no team has consistently pushed the Patriots quite like Baltimore. Correction: punched the Patriots quite like Baltimore.
 “The thing that sticks out to me above all else is when you play the Baltimore Ravens, they’re gonna come in and try to hit you square in the mouth,” Pats captain Matthew Slater said Friday. “And if you’re not ready, they’re gonna keep hitting you in the mouth. And you’ll never recover.”
 At its height, the rivalry exuded the essence of football. Sixty minutes of strategic violence orchestrated by sideline generals armed with Super Bowl rings.
 When Patriots center David Andrews, a Georgia native, thinks of the rivalry, the memories he summons first aren’t the two games he’s played against the Ravens. They’re of games he watched from afar in college and high school without rooting interest; drawn only by his visceral connection to a sport featuring two of its best teams.
 “Man, tough, physical,” Andrews said this week. “Feels like I’ve watched a lot of these games growing up.”
 In fact, he did. From 2010-2015, the Pats and Ravens met seven times. Four battles were fought in the playoffs. They split those wars, 2-2.
 Since Belichick began transforming the Patriots into an all-time powerhouse in 2000, Baltimore is the only team to have defeated the Pats twice in the playoffs as a road team. Those knockout blows reverberated throughout the league, proof the Patriots could be made to bleed, even in their own house.
 Though soon enough, revenge belonged to Belichick, who scored a 35-31 win in a divisional-round classic, the most memorable game in the rivalry’s history.
 Since then, the Pats are 1-1 against the Ravens. In 2016, a Monday night kickoff at Gillette Stadium represented a rare test on the Patriots’ regular- season slate of cupcakes. If they passed, they would be recognized as the rightful Super Bowl favorite. Eventually, they dispatched Baltimore, 30-23, having surviving a late comeback bid from a 20-point deficit in the third quarter.
 Even as underdogs, the Ravens validated them.
 A year ago, the Patriots were forced to return the favor. Under a primetime spotlight, Baltimore shattered their perfect 8-0 season start with a dominant performance that cemented the team’s status as an AFC contender. For the Pats, it was the first domino of disappointment to fall in a doomed season.
 Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson later won MVP, a celebration of the franchise’s completed evolution and his bright future.
 This week, Jackson and new Patriots quarterback Cam Newton created headlines by trading verbal bouquets; a far cry from the barbs Tom Brady and Terrell Suggs used to spit at one another.
 Until tonight, they’ll pass the time by showering one another with compliments.
 “To me, this organization does everything the right way,” Slater said. “Starting in the front office, and then on down to the coaching staff and the players. When you think about the way that football, in my mind, should be played — with physicality, with toughness, with commitment to each other and commitment to the process — I think Baltimore does that as well as anyone over the last several decades.”
 The scars Slater wears from past battles with Baltimore are rare in the Pats’ locker room. Only veterans like him, safety Devin McCourty and a few others can attest to what the series once meant, how it felt. The gravity of Sunday’s game, aside from its immediate implications, must be said aloud now, instead of being implicitly understood.
 “You know every time you play them, it’s a big game,” McCourty said. “They’re a hard-nosed team that’s going to come in and fight to the last play. It’s just going to be a tough football game.”
 How tough? Slater said what separates clashes with the Ravens from other games is how feels the next morning. Beaten, pained, almost broken.
 “But that’s a good thing,” Slater clarified. “That’s how it’s supposed to be.”
 Inevitably, as in all facets of life, what’s supposed to be yields to what actually is. The reality of Sunday’s situation is two franchises trending in opposite directions will hit pause to play football in an empty stadium on national TV. The result is unlikely to alter either’s course.
 But a close Patriots win would stoke the fires of memory and rivalry, simultaneously providing a reminder of what was and what could be again.

I have also raked all of the leaves off my lawn and had to shovel snow twice.
 It seemed like everything was moving forward in a typical New England fashion until last week.
 Sometime right around the presidential election, the climate changed. This would seem a fitting opportunity for a clever metaphor but my brain works best when considering the outdoors.
 Last week, the climate changed and we were given an extra week of summer. The unique weather pattern went well beyond a late fall or Indian summer. Temperatures soared into the mid-70s, I opened windows in my house, and even swatted a very confused mosquito while walking the dog.
 I recognized this freak occurrence with childlike excitement and considered every opportunity afforded to me by the great weather. I am fortunate enough to have a well-rounded group of friends and, inspired by the same weather pattern, everybody seemed to have a good idea for the weekend.
 I finally chose to accept an invitation to join a longtime friend named Gabe and fish the lower Connecticut River. Our target fish would be walleye and I had yet to catch one in 2020. The choice seemed obvious and Gabe’s expertise with this fishery all but guaranteed a great day on the river.
 Walleye are one of the most popular gamefish in the United States and, although they are found throughout many New England lakes and rivers, their popularity here is not as great. Similar in appearance to the yellow perch, their coloration is somewhat bland and their cloudy eye (wall-eye) does little to add to their beauty.
 It is this high-functioning eye that allows them great visibility in dark or murky conditions. Gabe and I targeted them in over 30 feet of water and chose brightly colored baits that we hoped they would gobble up.
 Luckily, as a resident of a more mild climate, Gabe had not winterized his boat and we hovered in still water over these hungry fish. After having driven over three hours to get there, I was rewarded with immediate action and hooked up on my second cast.
 Walleye are known for their soft, subtle bite but they were incredibly aggressive on this trip. Perhaps also inspired by the summerlike weather, they pounded jigs as we bounced them off the sandy bottom of the river. A common approach is to decorate any type of hook with a worm or minnow but we found it unnecessary on that day as the bite was aggressive and constant.
 The size of our catch that day varied but most fish were between 12 to 16 inches. They are a slow-growing fish and do not reach sexual maturity until they reach five or six years old. Because of this, their population can be considered delicate and we were careful to quickly and carefully release most of our fish.
 It is, however, universally known that walleye are one of the tastiest freshwater fish and we decided to bring a few home. Their fillets are soft and delicate, which translated into some very tasty fish tacos on Friday night. I ate them on my porch and took in the sunset of a very unique summer day in November.

CLARION — Being down one hitter and having another hobbled proved to be too much to overcome for West Shamokin against the No. 1- ranked lass 1A volleyball team in the state.
 The Wolves, playing without Maddie McConnell and with Lexie Young noticeably not at 100 percent, lost to Clarion, 25-10, 25-23, 25-11, in the PIAA quarterfinals Saturday afternoon at Clarion High School.
 “When you lose people last minute, it is tough,” West Shamokin coach Melinda Oesterling said. “We tried to overcome it. We didn’t, but we tried. I’m very proud of how the girls fought. They didn’t make excuses. They did their best to try to salvage it and do what they could. I am very proud of them. They showed a lot of character. It wasn’t easy coming out here knowing that your team isn’t where it normally is. That’s hard, especially for kids. But, I was very proud of them. It was a good learning experience.”
 Clarion coach Shari Campbell acknowledged the absence of McConnell and the limitations of Young played a role in his team’s easier-than-expected victory over the second-ranked team in the state.
 “(Young) is a great outside hitter,” Campbell said. “If she was here (100 percent), we would probably be talking about a four- or five-set match. And then I think (McConnell). she is a formidable outside also. That completely changes the makeup of this match for sure.”
 Regardless, Clarion came ready to play, and it showed with 15 kills from senior Erica Selfridge, including the 1,000th of her career; 14 from junior Korrin Burns, the younger sister of IUP player Oliva Burns who reached 1,000 kills in the District 9 championship match last week; and seven from sophomore Aryana Girvan. The 15 kills from Selfridge were one more than West Shamokin had as a team in the match.
 “Clarion is an awesome team,” Oesterling said. “I wish them luck. I hope they bring home the state title.”
 The Wolves (17-2), who had won 17 straight matches, didn’t help themselves with struggles receiving and passing the ball, something Oesterling attributed to players being asked to do things they don’t normally do.
 “We had people in there passing who don’t normally pass,” she said. “I think other people were trying to overcompensate a little bit. It didn’t work out very well for us. But, their servers, those are the toughest servers we have seen for a while. Both things together make it kind of tough.”
 Despite the loss, Oesterling reflected on a great season that included a District 6 title and a Heritage Conference championship that saw West Shamokin knock off Northern Cambria, its conference rival which had won the past two Class 1A titles before moving up to Class 2A this season.
 “It’s been fun,” Oesterling said. “We’ve had a lot of success. I really hope the girls don’t get disappointed on how it ended with everything they were able to accomplish.”
 The future is bright for the Wolves. Freshman Lily Jordan recorded four kills and a pair of block assists. Young, a junior, playing on an ankle she injured in the Heritage Conference championship match, added three kills. Sophomore Bailey Conrad, who got her first real playoff exposure as the match went on and held her own.
 Clarion will face WPIAL champion Bishop Canevin in the semifinals on Tuesday. Clarion is making its second straight appearance and third in four years in the semifinals.

9. Best name in college football: Rutgers kicker Valentino Ambrosio. The converted soccer player can kick too, nailing two field goals in the first half to give the Scarlet Knights a 13-7 lead at the break.
 ➜ 10. Yes, Illinois got plenty of reinforcements with guys coming off of quarantine. But it was missing starting linebacker Milo Eifler, who apparently was hurt during practice late in the week.
 ➜ 11. Illinois needs to work on its kickoff return plan. If you call for a fair catch, you get the ball at the 25-yard line every time. Starting inside the 20 is not acceptable. Hard to blame the returners for being enthusiastic about trying to make a big play. But the extra yards from a fair catch are too important for a struggling offense.
 ➜ 12. Lots of chatter about Smith’s job status during the week. A road win should quiet some of the talk. I believe strongly Smith will be back on the Illinois sideline in 2021.
 ➜ 13. Bad news for the Illinois offensive line, which lost starting tackle Alex Palczewski in the first half with a bad wheel. Danville’s Julian Pearl jumped into the lineup at right tackle.
 ➜ 14. I don’t understand the plan by Rutgers coach Greg Schiano, who went away from his running game after early success. Quarterback Noah Vedral threw a critical interception late to set up the Illini win. The Nebraska transfer had two other picks.
 ➜ 15. Meanwhile, Rutgers running back Isaih Pacheco gained 6.7 yards a pop on 20 tries. He finished with 134 yards and could have added another 100 if given 10 more carries. Odd strategy.
 ➜ 16. If I’m a Rutgers fan, I am happy to be more competitive, but upset about letting a winnable game get away. And I’m really curious about why the defense seemed more worried about Williams the passer than the runner. Made no sense.

But Sloan, 63, started looking at Woods Smoked Meats in Bowling Green again about a year ago. This time he was able to complete the purchase as part of an equal partnership with Woods Smoked Meats General Manager Steve Bolton and Cory Hawkins, owner of Central Missouri Meat & Sausage in Fulton. Terms were not disclosed.
 “It’s an attractive business,” Sloan said. “It’s been in business for about 65 years. It’s well-established in the community. It’s got great products.”
 Woods Smoked Meats is renowned in Northeast Missouri for its signature barbecue sauce, Sweet Betsy From Pike, and for its porkburgers, hams, and bacon.
 Sloan expects the combined businesses, called HWC Meats, to bring in around $12 million in 2021.
 Woods and Central Missouri Meat each have between 25 and 30 employees, which will help Wurst Haus deal with the growing demand for its products and space. Eventually, the deal could help get the Hermann meats in more grocery stores across the region.
 “At Wurst Haus, we are busting out at the seams, and we are landlocked,” Sloan said.
 Business has been up about 16 percent this year, Sloan said. While the meats Wurst Haus produces have sold well, the rush on store shelves during the pandemic also has more people bringing in their own meat they’ve raised or hunted for processing.
 “Every meat processor in the country is booked full,” he said. “The reason they’re booked full is people are going back to their roots. The reason they’re going back to their roots is because they can no longer depend on the grocery store shelves.”
 The problem has been a shortage of processors, rather than a shortage of meat, Sloan said.
 The partnership with the other processors will take some stress off Wurst Haus employees, he said. They now have 12 full-time and six part-time employees in Hermann but are looking to hire more.
 “If my staff isn’t working 50 to 55 hours a week, something is wrong,” Sloan said. “And I don’t want to kill them.”
 Wurst Haus applied for and received federal Paycheck Protection Program assistance early in the pandemic.

 ##  4\. Illinois is far from perfect.
 The Illini still have some worrisome issues.
 They struggled to put together an effective pass rush for most of the game. Rutgers quarterback Noah Vedral connected on 21 of 34 passes for 256 yards and two touchdowns, while Isaih Pacheco rushed for 138 yards on 21 carries.
 Illinois probably can’t afford to get off to a slow start any more this season. The Illini remain scoreless in the first quarter.
 They also came up short in the red zone, settling for two field-goal attempts on first-and-goal situations.
 The defense rescued Illinois with three second-half takeaways, including a key Nate Hobbs interception in the fourth quarter.

El artista puertorriqueño Jhay Cortez eleva su nivel de sofisticación, tanto a nivel musical como con el video que le acompaña, con el tema “Kobe en LA”, una canción, según dijo, más elaborada y que está convencido gustará a sus millones de seguidores en todo el mundo. “Sin duda que ‘Kobe en LA’ responde a un Jhay Cortez más elaborado”, dijo el compositor puertorriqueño de reguetón y trap, que hoy saca al mercado esta nueva apuesta de su carrera musical. Cortez destacó que se trata de un tema que trabajó durante los meses de la cuarentena y que está muy contento del resultado y del video. “Trabajé muy duro en él”, destacó, después de asegurar que introdujo en el coro dos voces femeninas que cree que aportan al tema en gran manera. “Es un ‘proyectazo’ que me llevó meses”, asegura el cantante, en un momento destacado de su carrera por las dos nominaciones al Latin Grammy y su colaboración con Bad Bunny “Dakiti”. “Me llevó meses preparar este proyecto”, sostuvo el artista, que ha tratado de sacar algo nuevo porque, asegura, odia “lo predecible”. Respecto al tipo de esta canción, indicó que ha tratado de perfeccionar su estilo sin mantenerse en lo estricto del reguetón o el trap, ya que su objetivo es avanzar en nuevos proyectos que sobre todo diviertan a las personas, en especial en un momento complicado como el actual por la covid-19. Dijo que intervino en las ideas del video y que aportó su punto de vista, cosa que hace habitualmente y que el resultado, sin duda, ha sido de su agrado. “Trato de poner en la pantalla mis ideas”, sostuvo el cantante, que indicó que cada vez está más interesado en meterse en la producción de los videos. “En el video se han reflejado estas ideas”, destacó. Respecto a futuras colaboraciones con otros artistas, destacó que está abierto a todo, no sólo a cantantes latinos como él. Cortez también se refirió a las consecuencias de la pandemia de la covid-19, que, según dijo, le ha afectado como a todo el mundo. “A mí me ha venido bien y he tenido tiempo para ‘redirigirme’”, subrayó. “Kobe en LA” sale este viernes al mercado en todas las plataformas y se espera que suponga un éxito más a su ya exitosa carrera, que destaca por contar con varias canciones multilatino con millones de reproducciones en YouTube. Cortez dio su gran paso al lanzar junto a Bad Bunny el tema “Dakiti”. En septiembre pasado estrenó junto a Lunay “Prendemos”, bajo la dirección musical del productor Haze y su compañía, House of Haze. Es además un compositor de gran éxito con temas como “Llama al sol”, de Tito El Bambino, y “Otra cosa” de Daddy Yankee. Su primer álbum de estudio titulado “Famouz” ya fue un éxito, a lo que sumó una edición especial de temas inéditos a comienzos de 2020 con el nombre de “Famouz Reloaded”. Comenzó a componer canciones a la temprana edad de 15 años. Compuso “Cómo Curar” y “Detective de tu Amor” para Zion & Lennox, y les produjo el tema “Soltera”. Formó parte de la banda de chicos de pop latino StereO 4 del 2012 al 2016. Jhay Cortez, de nombre de pila Jesús Manuel Nieves Cortez, nació en Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, en 1993, aunque vivió parte de su infancia en la localidad de Camden, en el estado de Nueva Jersey (EE.UU.). La ya estrella internacional se inició en el mundo de la música como compositor y productor de artistas de renombre, antes de firmar en 2017 con el sello Universal Music Latin y lanzó su álbum debut “Eyez On Me” al año siguiente. El álbum “Famouz” incluye el éxito “No Me Conoce (Remix)” con J Balvin y Bad Bunny.

Slovis threw for 325 yards and a touchdown on 30-of-43 passing. He was 11 of 12 for 158 yards on USC's final two drives.
 Gunnell threw for 286 yards and three touchdowns for Arizona, which played its first game in nearly a year after last week's opener against Utah was canceled due to the coronavirus.
 "There's definitely some disappointment, especially when it's that close and everyone is saying you're the underdog -- literally everyone," Gunnell said. "But we're optimistic and we're driven. That's the 20th-ranked team in the nation and our first game of the year."
 The sophomore entered the 2020 season as the starter after sharing time with Khalil Tate last year and had a streak of 92 straight passes without an interception. The streak nearly ended on his first pass against USC and then did on the second, when he overthrew a receiver into Talano Hufanga's arms.
 That set up Markese Stepp's 1-yard TD run.
 Gunnell was much better on the next drive, hitting Jamarye Joiner on a short pass that turned into a 34-yard touchdown.
 Arizona kept churning out yards -- 231 by halftime -- but had to settle for three field goal attempts. Lucas Havrisik made two and USC led 17-13 at halftime after Stephen Carr scored on a 3-yard run with 2 1/2 minutes left.
 Arizona tied it at 20 when Gunnell hit Tayvian Cunningham in stride for a 75-yard touchdown reception in the third quarter.
 USC struggled in the red zone early in the second half.
 Amon-Ra St. John pulled down a spectacular 48-yard catch, but the Trojans stalled and settled for Parker Lewis' 28-yard field goal. Stepp ripped off a 49-yard run on the next drive and USC marched down to Arizona's 1-yard line. Consecutive penalties back the Trojans up and Lewis pushed a 28-yard field goal wide right.
 Another drive into the red zone, another trip without points. This time, Arizona stopped the Trojans on fourth-and-1 from the Wildcats 4.
 Havrisik gave Arizona its first lead at 23-20 with a 51-yard field goal midway through the fourth.
 "You either win or lose, but we had some experienced guys we expected to play well and obviously some newcomers, whether they were transfers or young guys that played well, but not well enough to win," Arizona coach Kevin Sumlin said. "That's the bottom line."
 THE TAKEAWAY
 USC played undisciplined at times and was disjointed at times on offense, particularly in the red zone. The Trojans again pulled it together for a 2-0 start.
 Arizona did not look rusty in its first game in nearly a year. Gunnell was sharp and the defense was solid in its first game under new coordinator Paul Rhoads before playing on its heels on the final two drives.
 POLL IMPLICATIONS
 USC moved up a spot after its close call against Arizona State, but may drop a spot or two after going down to the wire against a team it was heavily favored against.
 TROJAN MISTAKES
 Last week, USC was plagued by four turnovers. Against Arizona, the Trojans struggled with penalties and capitalizing in the red zone.
 USC had 11 penalties for 110 yards and twice came away with no points after reaching Arizona's 5-yard line.
 "We had some opportunities to put the game away in the second half and didn't," Helton said.
 BRIGHT BRIGHTWELL
 Arizona running back Gary Brightwell spent his first three seasons in Tucson as a backup before becoming the No. 1 running back this season.
 The senior had a strong debut, using his speed and hard-nosed running to pick up 112 yards on 21 carries.

The Indiana County board of elections Thursday disqualified nearly half of the ballots received after Nov. 3, Election Day, at the Indiana County Court House.
 The panel’s review has no effect on the outcome of the presidential election or any statewide races in Indiana County; the board left 13 of 22 such ballots eligible to be counted, if allowed later by the courts.
 The ballots canvassed by the three-member election board, comprised of Commissioners Michael Keith, Robin Gorman and Sherene Hess, are those that have been set aside since Friday under a ruling by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito to exclude them from the vote count pending further review.
 The count of the post-election ballots was blocked on a petition to the court by President Donald Trump’s campaign committee. The votes are those that had been cast under a Pennsylvania regulation allowing a tally of votes postmarked no later than Nov. 3 and delivered by the U.S. Postal Service no later than Nov. 6.
 The challenge against late votes in Pennsylvania is one of scores of moves by the Trump campaign to hold up certification of the election, disqualify or overturn individual votes, and reverse the outcome of the presidential election.
 Trump filed before the election to have late votes blocked. His campaign also sued Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar and the boards of elections in all 67 counties, alleging fraud in the voting and counting. An 85-page suit filed Monday zeroed in on Fayette and Luzerne counties.
 Keith and Gorman said they hadn’t seen the lawsuit, nor had they seen problems with the county’s election.
 “As far as our process and everything, yes,” Keith said when asked of his satisfaction with the local election.
 Gorman said she personally tested the exceptions to the process by requesting and casting mail-in ballots in the primary and the presidential election.
 “I can speak to that process. It was solid,” Gorman said. “Mike and I have been every single step of the way with our team,” she added. “We got training, we watched the process, we watched Robin (Maryai) trouble-shoot everything that was coming at us. We met, we talked, and we’re making good decisions.”
 The elections board conducted the final canvass with election observers Patrick Dougherty, a Democrat, and William Darr, a Republican, present to ask questions and for clarification of the process.
 They had no disagreements with the process and, afterward, agreed with each other’s criticism of the state’s election guidelines.
 “Absurd,” they considered the ambiguity of the rules that allow different counties to decide differently on eligibility of certain ballots.
