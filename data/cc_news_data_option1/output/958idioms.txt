Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, is among those arguing hospitals need to change course.
 "It's just not sustainable to think that every time a health care worker is exposed they have to be quarantined for 14 days. We'd run out of health care workers," Nuzzo says. Anyone showing signs of infection should stay home, she adds, but providers who may have been exposed but are not symptomatic should not necessarily be excluded from work.
 The correct response, she and others say, comes down to a careful balance of the evolving science with the need to maintain a functioning health care system.
 While hospitals are supposed to be prepared for just such a situation, Nuzzo says, their plans often fall short. "Absent any imminent public health crisis, it may not be one of their priorities," she says. From 2003 to 2019, federal funding for the Hospital Preparedness Program in the U.S. was cut almost in half.
 In Northern California, potential exposure to the new coronavirus was exacerbated because hospitals were caught unaware by the community spread of the virus and hampered by federal protocols that initially limited diagnostic testing to patients with a history of travel to a country where the virus was known to be circulating or contact with a person with a known infection.
 "At the very beginning [of an outbreak] this will happen because you don't know patients are infected and you only realize later that people were exposed," says Grzegorz Rempala, a mathematician at the College of Public Health at Ohio State University who models the spread of infectious diseases.
 Now that the disease has started to spread through the community, any patient with respiratory symptoms potentially could be infected, though health officials note the likelihood remains low. As providers start routinely wearing protective gear and employing strict safety protocols, accidental exposure should decline.
 The Vacaville case offers stark insight into the fallout from the narrow testing protocols initially established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When a woman was admitted to NorthBay VacaValley Hospital with respiratory symptoms on Feb. 15, dozens of hospital workers walked in and out of her room performing daily tasks. Days later, as her condition worsened, she was sent to the University of California, Davis Medical Center, where dozens more employees were potentially exposed.
 Because the woman did not meet the testing criteria in place at the time, it took days for UC Davis to get approval to have her assessed for the coronavirus. After the test came back positive, about 100 NorthBay workers were sent into self-quarantine for 14 days. At UC Davis, an additional 36 nurses and 88 other employees were quarantined, according to the unions representing those workers. (A spokesman for UC Davis says the figures were not accurate but declined to give an estimate.)
 "We're not used to being concerned, before we even do the triage assessment, [about] whether the patient is infectious and could infect hospital workers," says Dr. Kristi Koenig, the EMS medical director of San Diego County. But that thinking started to change, she says, during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Hospitals should routinely mask patients who come in with respiratory symptoms, she says, given any such patient could have an infectious disease such as tuberculosis.
 Yet providers don't often think in those terms. "In many ways we're spoiled because we've gone from a society 50 or 100 years ago where the major killers were infectious disease," says Dr. Michael Wilkes, a professor at UC Davis School of Medicine. "Now we've become complacent because the major killers are heart disease and diabetes."
 Faced with this new infection risk, many hospitals are scrambling to retrain workers in safety precautions, such as how to correctly don and doff personal protective equipment.
 Sutter Health, which has 24 hospitals in Northern California, started ramping up its emergency management system five weeks ago in preparation for COVID-19. Before coming to the emergency room, Sutter patients are asked to call a hotline where they are assessed by a nurse or an automated system designed to screen for symptoms of the virus. Those with likely symptoms are guided to a telemedicine appointment unless they need to be admitted to a hospital.
 Anyone arriving at a Sutter emergency room with signs of a respiratory infection is given a mask and sequestered. "A runny nose and a cough doesn't tell you much. It could be a cold, it could be a flu, and in this weather it could be allergies," says Dr. Bill Isenberg, Sutter's chief quality and safety officer. A doctor or nurse in protective equipment — including N95 mask, gown and goggles — is deployed to assess the patient's symptoms. If COVID-19 is suspected, the patient is moved into a private room.
 Sutter has treated several coronavirus patients who arrived from Travis Air Force Base, which housed evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan after an outbreak was detected onboard. The Sutter patients were placed in negative pressure rooms so that contaminated air did not circulate to the rest of the hospital, and staff used an anteroom to take off gowns and masks.
 "We do everything humanly possible to minimize the number of people who have to enter [the room]," Isenberg says. Still, he says, some workers have been quarantined; Sutter would not disclose the total.
 Not all hospitals are adapting so quickly. National Nurses United, a union representing more than 150,000 nurses, recently held a news conference to call on hospitals to better protect their workers. Of the 6,500 nurses who participated in a survey the union circulated, fewer than half said they had gotten instruction in how to recognize and respond to possible cases of COVID-19. Just 30% said their employer has sufficient protective equipment on hand to protect staff if there were a surge in infected patients.
 As the virus continues to spread, hospitals should be stockpiling such equipment, figuring out how to add beds and planning for staffing shortages, says Dr. Richard Waldhorn, a professor of medicine at Georgetown University and contributing scholar at Johns Hopkins who recently co-authored recommendations for hospitals on how to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic.
 Hospitals should already be training providers to take on expanded duties, Waldhorn says. If a hospital becomes overwhelmed, the Medical Reserve Corps can be mobilized, as can networks of providers who have volunteered to aid in emergency situations. Once workers have been infected and recover, it might make sense to have them treat other coronavirus patients since they likely will have immunity.
 Eventually, as a disease becomes widespread, quarantine simply stops being a priority, says Nina Fefferman, a mathematician and epidemiologist at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.
 "There's a point where we stop trying to quarantine anyone and we just say, OK, we're going to have more deaths from the fire department not being able to fight fire than from everyone getting the disease."

BANKS SHOT: Banks took a body blow last week when the U.S. Fed made a surprise cut to benchmark interest rates to protect the economy. Banks rely on interest payments from loans to generate capital, and they've already been operating in an extraordinarily low rate environment. On Monday, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist, Ellen Zentner, said she now expects the Federal Reserve to follow its 50 basis point intermeeting rate cut with another 50 basis point interest rate cut in March, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to 0.50-0.75%. Zentner also expects the March rate cut will be followed by a 25 basis point rate cut at the April meeting, bringing the fed funds rate into a 0.25-0.50% target range. JP Morgan Chase tumbled 13%, while Bank of America and Citi fell around 16%.

The 280 billion euros (US$320 billion) per year global luxury goods sector, already reeling from months of protests in the shopping hub of Hong Kong, was dealt a hammer blow earlier this year by the coronavirus outbreak in mainland China.
 As authorities battled to contain the emergency in a country that is home to more than a third of global luxury shoppers, brands were forced to shut shops, shelve new openings and postpone advertising spending there.
 The spread of the virus across the world, and to Italy in particular, has compounded the pain, with countries including Britain and the United States warning against non-essential travel to Italy, slowing tourism to a trickle.
 That is set to translate into a major sales hit for the country's 90 billion euros fashion and textile industry.
 SUPPLY CHAINS
 It also has implications for the luxury industry worldwide due to Italy's importance as a supplier, said Flavio Cereda, an industry analyst at Jefferies, who on Monday cut his 2020 sales forecast for the sector for a second time this year.
 He now expects a sales decline of 3per cent at current exchange rates, compared with his previous forecast for 1per cent growth.
 "Prolonged disruption of economic activity may well result in supply chain issues for most brands," he said, adding, however, that he had no evidence of that happening yet.
 Though Tuscany is not part of the lockdown, its Scandicci manufacturing hub - which had been booming in recent years as luxury giants from LVMH to Kering and Prada expanded their production sites and snapped up workshops - is suffering.
 Massimiliano Guerrini, whose family owns Almax, a Scandicci-based producer which makes bags for 10 brands including Kering's Saint Laurent, Gucci and Balenciaga as well as LVMH labels, said he had seen a decline in orders "of a few percentage points" due to the coronavirus emergency in China.
 "I thought things were not too bad given the circumstances, but now this new alarm in Italy risks making more casualties among businesses than among people and disrupting the supply chain for the orders that are still in the pipeline," he said.
 "We have 270 employees and have diversified our customers, so we managed to mitigate the impact so far. But some of the smaller suppliers are not going to make it."
 A leather goods and handbag supplier in Veneto reported a 30per cent plunge in orders from LVMH's Louis Vuitton, while others said Prada and Ferragamo were also cutting back orders.
 Ferragamo said it could not comment for this story as it is due to publish 2019 results on Tuesday. Prada said it was also not commenting as it is due to release its results on March 18. Kering declined to comment, while LVMH had no immediate comment.
 WHOLE YEAR AT RISK
 Claudio Marenzi, who is in charge of fashion at business lobby Confindustria, said foreign buyers of Italian textiles had started cancelling orders in late February and some retail outlets had seen sales halve.
 "Since the virus emerged in China we knew there was going to be a slowdown in the first quarter. But now the whole year risks going up in smoke for us," he said.
 A source with knowledge of the situation said Ferragamo had told employees to take Fridays off for the next eight weeks, frozen new hires and the renewal of fixed-term job contracts.
 After holding its Milan fashion week show behind closed doors, Giorgio Armani closed its northern Italy factories for a week in late February. A spokeswoman said on Monday they had reopened in the first week of March, although most employees were working from home.
 Luca Bortolotto, head of apparel and accessories at artisans and small businesses association Confartigianato in Vicenza, one of Veneto's main cities, said he was thinking of hiring a child minder to help workers at his leather goods business, given schools have been closed across the country.
 "And as if all this was not enough, we live in fear that one of our workers may fall sick, which would mean putting everyone under quarantine and paralyzing the whole company," he said.

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a big decision to make this offseason. For the first time in his 20-year career, the future Pro Football Hall of Famer is considering playing football somewhere other than Foxborough, and while he's almost 43-years-old, several NFL teams are expected to line up to procure his services. Recently, Brady did something that could indicate he's interested in moving out west. In an exclusive interview with Deadline, Brady announced that he was launching 199 Productions -- a global multi- platform content company to develop original premium content including documentaries, feature films and television shows.
 The company has assembled a slate of development projects that include several with Brady on camera, in stories spanning sports, entertainment, health and wellness among others.
 "I'm excited to announce to the world the official launch of 199 Productions," Brady wrote on Instagram "When I was the 199th draft pick in 2000, I knew I needed to work hard every day to prove myself. Launching a production company is no different and I'm humbled to have the opportunity to partner with (the Russo Brothers), (AGBO Films) and (Gotham Chopra) on our first project 'Unseen Football.' I believe in the essence of teamwork, and I have no doubt, our 199 Productions team and partners will create inspiring content to share with the world.

These are the days for cool heads, reasoned decisions and steadfast leadership.
 The global outbreak of the coronavirus has put the world, and Israel, in uncharted territory. People have reacted to the crisis in a variety of ways, from taking a blase attitude and carrying on as if all is normal, to working from home and avoiding public transportation and any public gathering.
 Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman Tov told KAN's Keren Neubach on Monday that it was only a matter of time until Israel would have to enforce a 14-day quarantine period for anyone entering the country - Israelis and foreigner alike, including those from the US.
 There has been criticism of the strict measures the government has taken until now to contain the virus, including a mandatory 14-day quarantine for any travelers arriving from France, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Austria and most of the Far East. Some have deemed these restrictions draconian, but they seem to be working in stemming the proliferation of the virus in the Israel.
 As of Monday morning, 39 people in Israel had contracted the virus, with one, a bus driver who was infected by Greek tourists he transported, deemed to be in serious condition.
 As the Post's Maayan Hoffman reported on Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained in a Sunday evening briefing at the Prime Minister's Office that the decision is a complicated one.
 "We take action as we understand it to be necessary and everyone accepts it - obviously the United States too… on the other hand, this decision is a very difficult [one]; the same was true last night and today, and will be true the next day."
 The decision to quarantine all arrivals is one that shouldn't be taken lightly or have a hint of political considerations. Reports that the prime minister was holding back from enforcing the ban on US travelers in order to not damage ties with President Donald Trump were vigorously denied Sunday. Siman Tov told Channel 12 News that "no political element was part of our decision-making process… all the decisions go to the National Security Council and the prime minister in the end. It's a professional discussion on protecting the public. No foreign interests are involved in the decision."
 Although it's difficult, in this acrimonious post-election period, to remove politics from any issue on the domestic agenda, there's an imperative that the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis should rise above partisan considerations. Netanyahu seems to be meeting that criteria - so far.
 Unlike in the US, where the handling of the virus has turned into a political football pitting the "downplaying" Republicans against the "take it seriously" Democrats, Israelis seem to be reacting to the crisis with one voice.
 Netanyahu has, of course, made every effort to appear "presidential" and in charge of the situation. He spoke with US Vice President Mike Pence and on Sunday and then with European leaders on Monday about setting up airports to enable goods to be transported between countries so vital supplies don't run out.
 And whether that's his intention or not, these moves could help Netanyahu as he fights for his political life.
 As Jeremy Sharon wrote, "the more he looks like he's taking care of business, the more urgent the problem, the more acute and dangerous it is, the more we won't want to change the leadership and instead keep the status quo."
 The corona crisis may indeed inadvertently help Netanyahu, but at some point, our well-developed and well-earned sense of cynicism needs to be put aside. In times of national emergency, we have to believe that our leadership, no matter how embattled, is making decisions based on the well-being of its citizens.
 Now is the time to heed the instructions being issued by our health experts. Just as we expect our leadership to act responsibly, we too must abide by the guidelines being set: whether it's entering self-quarantine, not sitting in the first seat behind the bus driver or undertaking the proper hygienic procedures to minimize the possibility of contracting or passing the virus.
 In periods of crisis, Israelis have always risen to the task. From our leadership on down, this is one of those times to prove it again.

"The second one is economic uncertainty. They go hand in hand," he said. "Banks have historically been a pretty good proxy for the economy. You start thinking loan growth is going to slow and credit losses will pick up if the economy slows down."
 Among large-cap banks, KBW wrote that energy loans represent 15per cent of Citigroup's tangible common equity (TCE) compared with 10per cent for Wells Fargo and Bank of America and 7per cent for JPMorgan.
 Citi analyst Keith Horowitz cited "relatively modest" exposure to oil and gas loans among big banks in his research note but listed bigger issues including higher odds of a recession, a market overreaction to credit risks, and lower interest rates.
 "The fear factor from the virus is clearly causing economic strain, and as a result, the odds of a recession are moving higher even though it is not in the data yet," said Horowitz.
 The analyst said he was most worried that rates would fall further.
 "Fundamentally, this is what we are most concerned about and believe that today’s actions only increase the likelihood of lower rates."
 While some market strategists have said Monday's broad sell-off, with the S&P last down 7per cent , could be a buying opportunity, Horowitz said his customers were wary.
 "There is very little 'buy the dip' mentality in conversations we're having with investors," he said.

In remembrance of Wade A. Schummer, friends and family may gather on Saturday, March 14, 2020, from noon to 2 p.m. at Williams Dingmann Family Funeral Home, Princeton, MN, for a visitation and fellowship. A Memorial Service will begin at 2 p.m. on Saturday for Wade Schummer, who passed away unexpectedly at his home in Bemidji. Burial will be in the Green Lake Cemetery, Princeton, MN, at a later date. Wade was born to the late Leroy and Fern (Gillette) Schummer in Minneapolis, MN, on November 2, 1962. Wade graduated from Princeton High School in 1981. He went on to attend Willmar Technical College for an Associate’s Degree in Agriculture. Wade was married twice in his life. His first wife was Vicki, with whom he had two children, Michael and Angela. His second wife was Tammy, with whom he had one child, Amber. Wade was a lifetime truck driver, with his most recent employment being with North Central Door in Bemidji. Wade had many other work ventures in his life involving farming, logging, and lumber sales. Wade enjoyed fishing, hunting, and camping with his family and friends. He loved to travel and was a major history buff. He enjoyed watching YouTube music videos, bargain shopping for treasures, walking through the woods, and loved to just go for a drive “down the road.” Wade was a professional napper and would never turn away an offer of food, especially a sweet treat. He was a master story teller, always adding a little extra flair, and loved to goof around and tease his kids and grandkids. Wade is survived by his children, Mike (Danielle) Schummer of Princeton, Angela (Eric) Hansen of Sauk Rapids, and Amber Schummer of Sartell; sisters, Deanna Schummer of Princeton and Jody Weimert (Frank Galler) of Janesville, MN; and brother, Jason (Angelica) Schummer of Princeton. Wade is also survived by his four grandchildren, Trista, Lillian, Owen, and Jackson; as well as many cousins, nieces, nephews, and close friends. Wade was preceded in death by his parents; uncle Henry; and aunt, Julie Schummer. Wade was a loving person who will be deeply missed by many. His children will forever cherish their memories of him and carry his stories onto his grandchildren.

 Imagine then my surprise at learning that Safehouse had entered into a lease with a landlord in the old St. Agnes Burn Center building, and was prepared to open up the following Monday. Surprise might not be the right word. Fury is a bit closer to what I, and many of my South Philadelphia neighbors, were feeling.
