Director Neeraj Pandey, who has been behind spy thrillers like "Baby", "Aiyaari" and "Naam Shabana", believes there is an appetite for such films and shows as long as one does not repeat the story. With "Special Ops", Neeraj has ventured into the world of streaming and the director is happy with the response to his show on Hotstar. "These are fantastic stories that entertain people. We got this story for another format and it has worked so fantastically here as well. That means there is an appetite for such stories from the audience and that is what encourages us. As long as we are not repeating, the genre doesn't matter," Neeraj told PTI in an interview.
 "Ultimately, what you have made is for the audience, you look forward to their response. The icing on the cake is when they loved watching it as much as you loved making it. It is satisfying," he said, adding, he doesn’t read reviews but there are certain people, whose opinion he values. Streaming platforms have opened an entire world of possibilities for directors, believes Neeraj.
 "The format is new... There are stories that are getting made. The field is wide open for anybody to come and make an impression. Something that is well made and well told will have an audience that is eager to see it. "If you manage to deliver a narrative that holds them for seven hours convincingly and engagingly, they are happy and feel their time is well spent.” The eight- episode series is about the 19-year-long manhunt to nab the mastermind behind the 2001 Parliament bombings.
 Neeraj, who has co-directed the show with Shivam Nair, said it was a challenge to sustain the attention of the audience for a story that takes place in a time period of 19 years. Kay Kay Menon plays Himmat Singh, a senior analyst and logistics head at the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in the show, which also mentions of Babri Masjid demolition, Muzaffarnagar riots , 26/11 terror attacks.
 "I consciously chose this particular story for this format because it allowed me to set it over a fantastically long timeline and put certain milestones so that people could relate to the journey of Himmat Singh," he said. On a larger level, he said, the aim was to convey the story about a man, standing against all odds, not ready to give up in face of adversity. "If you look at it closely more than it being a spy or espionage drama it is a human drama, about a guy, his tenacity. He is someone who doesn't give up for 18 to 20 long years. It is a story about his belief and that is how I approached the material.
 "People can relate to it be it man or woman that how at some point of a time they are standing against the odds with people not believing in what they have to say or feel and your journey in proving the world wrong." Neeraj has added a touch of humour to Himmat Singh, which he said, gave an interesting layer to the character. "Maybe it is the sense of humour that has kept Himmat Singh going for those 19 or 20 years. Maybe a guy, who is dead serious all the time would have given up or broken down but it is his ability to see through things and understand life at some level in better manner, with a quirky side he takes things with a pinch of a salt." Usually, web shows have an open ending but Neeraj said he wanted this story to complete in the first season. If they take up the show again, there will be a fresh story to tell. "I don't know when season two is happening and how. If it happens it will be a new story. It's just been eight to nine days the season one has come and we are waiting for the feedback and then we will re-group and think what to do with it." The Hotstar Special series, which opened on March 17, boast of an ensemble cast including Divya Dutta, Vinay Pathak, Karan Tacker, Sajjad Delafrooz, Sana Khaan, Saiyami Kher, Meher Vij, Vipul Gupta and Muzammil Ibrahim.

Rather than imagining the lockdown as having an on/off switch – where the only choice is between completely shutting down the country or throwing all rules out the window — many scientists advocate for charting a course in between, where restrictions can be ramped up or down. Imagine that the lockdown has a volume dial that can be twisted up or down.
 “With more information, we can target our responses to be the most impactful,” said Nadia Abuelezam, a disease researcher at Boston College. That might mean introducing people back into the workforce in stages, she suggested.
 Scientists are closely watching what happens in other countries that were struck earlier by the coronavirus to see what happens when those places loosen restrictions.
 Restaurants and offices have begun to reopen in many Chinese cities, about two months after the country began to lock down. There are still restrictions in place — such as limits in how many people can occupy an elevator or a conference room — and widespread testing for the disease continues.
 A second outbreak could prompt future clampdowns.
 “People should be prepared for the fact that we are not going back to completely normal life for a while,” said Mark Jit, a disease researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “But we also need to allow people to see the light at end of the tunnel.”
 The metaphorical dial of restrictions could be set in different positions, depending on what expanded testing reveals about how many people in an area are currently infected — and how many have recovered from past infections.

Hailing the decisions taken by the Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) to mitigate the economic slowdown triggered by the COVID-19 lockdown, NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant called them progressive and timely measures. Taking to Twitter, Kant lauded RBI governor Shaktikanta Das and said he has provided much-needed relief to working capital with this announcement.
 Referring to the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, Kant called the decision a "timely measure." "Way to go: Progressive and timely measures by @RBI @DasShaktikanta's by giving 3-month moratorium on payments of term loan instalments (EMI) and much-desired relief on interest on working capital. Slashing Repo Rate and Reverse Repo Rate will infuse liquidity. Big, bold steps," the NITI Aayog CEO tweeted.
 The RBI on Friday announced that the banks are permitted to allow a 3-month moratorium on payment of installments of all term loans outstanding on March 1, 2020. This decision applies to all financial institutions of the country which includes -- regional, rural banks, co-operative banks, NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies.
 The central bank also lowered the key repo rate by 75 basis points to 4.4 per cent in a bid to arrest the economic slowdown amid coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. (ANI)

BERLIN -- Germany has proposed using big data and location tracking to isolate people with coronavirus to keep the pandemic under control once social distancing measures now in force have slowed its spread, media reported on Friday.
 The Interior Ministry's strategy paper recommends following South Korea in aggressively testing for COVID-19 and using smartphone location data to help trace people who have come into contact with those infected with the flu-like disease.
 These measures would be critical to prevent renewed flare-ups once measures now in force - such as school closures and restrictions on movement - succeed in slowing coronavirus, according to reports in Der Spiegel and the Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
 Governments across Europe are turning to technology to track the coronavirus, an approach that seeks to learn from Asia but is also putting the region's privacy rules to the test.
 Government surveillance is a sensitive topic in Germany, where memories of the dreaded East German Stasi secret police and its extensive network of informants are still fresh in the minds of many.
 Germany has some of the toughest privacy laws in the world due to its experience with state surveillance systems once used by the Nazis and the Stasi.
 The German study, entitled "How We Get COVID-19 Under Control," looked at one scenario in which testing would be ramped up in the coming weeks, with mobile test stations and strict isolation of those infected.
 "To make testing faster and more efficient," Spiegel quoted the paper as reading, "the use of big data and location tracking is unavoidable in the long term."
 If the model is followed, scientists who worked on the study calculated that around one million people in Germany would be infected, but only 12,000 would die. The strict procedure would have to be maintained for two months, Spiegel reported.
 However, since only a small portion of the population would be immunized against the virus after that time, "a continuously high level of vigilance would have to be maintained," according to the report.
 A worst-case scenario in the study looked at what would happen if Germany took little action: some 70 percent of the population would soon be infected, more than 80 percent of would-be intensive care patients would have to be turned away from hospitals, and the death toll would exceed 1 million.
 As of Thursday, Germany had 42,288 confirmed cases and 253 deaths from the coronavirus. It has extended a lockdown by banning public meetings of more than two people unless they live in the same household. (Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Nick Macfie)

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Los Angeles recorded its first case of coronavirus five weeks before New York City, yet it's New York that is now the U.S. epicenter of the disease.
 Public health officials are keeping a wary eye and warning that LA could end up being as hard hit as New York in coming weeks, in part because a planned increase in testing may uncover a dramatic surge in cases. Testing in Los Angeles County is expected to increase from 500 per day to 5,000 by the end of the week.
 “I would love to be able to say with all certainty that's where we're not going,” Los Angeles Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said when asked about New York's numbers. “We would be foolish not to prepare for a similar scenario here in LA County.”
 In both cities, schools have been canceled, many businesses shuttered and employees who can have been ordered to work from home. New York City, with roughly 8.5 million residents, had nearly 22,000 cases and 281 deaths as of Thursday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Los Angeles County, which contains its namesake city of 4 million people plus an additional 6 million residents, had just over 1,200 cases and 21 deaths.
 Health experts don't know why there is such a big difference in the number of cases, but believe several things could be at play, such as urban density, differences in the use of mass transportation and slightly earlier moves by authorities to enact social distancing policies. A difference in the speed and amount of tests could also be factors, as officials warn that many people who get COVID-19 don't necessarily have symptoms.
 The virus is spread in tiny droplets from coughs and sneezes. Most people who get it experience mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For others, in particular older adults or people with other large health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s central bank on Friday cut its key interest rate by a sizable 75 basis points to 4.4% from 5.15% to ease financing troubles caused by the coronavirus outbreak and help revive the economy.
 That’s the lowest benchmark rate the Reserve Bank of India has charged on lending to commercial banks, its so-called “repo rate,” since March 2010.
 The announcement by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das came a day after India's finance ministry announced a 1.7 trillion ($22 billion) economic stimulus package. The package included delivering grains and lentil rations for three months to 800 million people, some 60% of the world's second-most populous country.
 The RBI held a monetary policy committee meeting nearly a week early to cope with the disruptions to the economy due to a three-week lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday.
 The RBI will also allow banks a 3-month moratorium on payments of installments on loans.

Kay Kay Menon plays Himmat Singh, a senior analyst and logistics head at the Research and Analysis Wing RAW in the show, which also mentions of Babri Masjid demolition, Muzaffarnagar riots , 2611 terror attacks.I consciously chose this particular story for this format because it allowed me to set it over a fantastically long timeline and put certain milestones so that people could relate to the journey of Himmat Singh, he said. On a larger level, he said, the aim was to convey the story about a man, standing against all odds, not ready to give up in face of adversity. If you look at it closely more than it being a spy or espionage drama it is a human drama, about a guy, his tenacity. He is someone who doesnt give up for 18 to 20 long years. It is a story about his belief and that is how I approached the material.People can relate to it be it man or woman that how at some point of a time they are standing against the odds with people not believing in what they have to say or feel and your journey in proving the world wrong. Neeraj has added a touch of humour to Himmat Singh, which he said, gave an interesting layer to the character. Maybe it is the sense of humour that has kept Himmat Singh going for those 19 or 20 years. Maybe a guy, who is dead serious all the time would have given up or broken down but it is his ability to see through things and understand life at some level in better manner, with a quirky side he takes things with a pinch of a salt. Usually, web shows have an open ending but Neeraj said he wanted this story to complete in the first season. If they take up the show again, there will be a fresh story to tell. I dont know when season two is happening and how. If it happens it will be a new story. Its just been eight to nine days the season one has come and we are waiting for the feedback and then we will re-group and think what to do with it. The Hotstar Special series, which opened on March 17, boast of an ensemble cast including Divya Dutta, Vinay Pathak, Karan Tacker, Sajjad Delafrooz, Sana Khaan, Saiyami Kher, Meher Vij, Vipul Gupta and Muzammil Ibrahim.

“Before this crisis started to unravel, we were absolutely determined for our guys to play the IPL,” Langer was quoted as saying by _foxsports.co.au_.
 “Because with the T20 World Cup coming up, there’s no better grounding, no better practice, no better tournament for them to get ready for that,” he added.
 However, keeping in view the fast increasing transmission of the deadly disease, the Indian government has called for a nation-wide 21-day lockdown, which has casts serious doubts over the future of the cash-rich event’s 13th edition.
 “But obviously things have changed a lot. The health of not only our individual players, but also our country and India as a whole is paramount here,” Langer said.
 Australia’s Pat Cummins, David Warner, Aaron Finch, Steve Smith were to headline the IPL.
 Langer, who is also a member of the national selection panel, insists he is not stressed about picking players as Australia have a well settled side.
 The Aaron Finch-led side defeated South Africa 2-1 in three-match T20 series in February.
 “In terms of selection, I’m not too stressed about it ... one or two positions in our World Cup side are up for grabs. It’s a very, very settled team. We played great cricket against South Africa,” he added.
 Australia are scheduled to start their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan on October 24 in Sydney.
 The ICC have maintained the T20 World Cup will go ahead as per planned but postponed the qualifying events on Thursday.
