"I had so much inventory and I needed to sell it. I was forced to figure this out," Campbell says.
 A recession amid a pandemic may seem like the worst time to start a business. Despite millions of loans and grants from federal and state governments, it's estimated that hundreds of thousands of companies have already failed since the virus outbreak began.
 Yet, from people like Campbell, who'd invested too much money to turn back, to others who lost their jobs and saw starting their own company as the best path forward, thousands of Americans have opted to take the plunge. A few have even folded one business and quickly launched another better suited for the "new normal" of the pandemic.
 Owners of all these fledgling companies face a tough road as they try to bring in customers and thrive. While nearly 80% of startup companies had survived their first year in 2019, according to research by the Kauffman Foundation, those businesses had the benefit of launching in a strong economy.
 Prosperity is tougher in a downturn -- consumers and businesses spend less and new ventures tend to have large startup costs and low revenue. U.S. gross domestic product plunged by nearly a third from April through July, and there are still more than 13 million people unemployed.
 Slightly over one million companies that have employees were launched in 2018 while 925,000 closed, according to the latest available data from the Labor Department.
 Despite the ongoing pandemic, interest in starting a business has picked up as parts of the U.S economy reopened. The number of applications for business tax identification numbers was down more than a third at the end of March compared to year-earlier levels; in the week ended Sept. 5, the most recent data available, they were up 93.6%. The applications don't necessarily mean businesses were launched, but the numbers do show that despite the virus's grip on the economy, people were considering starting companies.
 Unemployed people needing a source of income likely accounted for some of those applications, says Dane Stangler, a researcher at the think tank Bipartisan Policy Center. But he also says owners who closed their businesses permanently early in the pandemic might be starting up again with a different entity.
 Yavonne Sarber knew her Sugar Whisky Sis restaurant in Covington, Kentucky, wouldn't survive a government-ordered shutdown. So, she closed it for good and four weeks later opened an entirely new restaurant on the site, one focused on takeout and delivery.
 "We couldn't sit still -- we knew we had to do something," says Sarber, who also owns four Agave & Rye restaurants in Kentucky and Ohio.
 She opened Papi Jocho's Street Dogs and Cantina on May 5, less than two months after Kentucky restaurants and bars closed for inside dining. Business has been so good there that revenue at all her restaurants overall is up 25% from its pre-pandemic level even as indoor dining capacity at the Agave & Rye branches is limited to half.

Checks need to be accompanied with a letter or note indicating the funds are for the Lakeside Brick Wall project so there is no confusion, according to Williams.
 Contributions can be made in honor of or in memory of someone. Contributions of $5,000 or more will be recognized with small bronze plaques, like the ones on Conway's Main Street Memorial Bridge. Donation letters and forms can be found online at cityofconway.com. On the left side of the front page, go to Residents and then City Cemeteries.
 Burroughs is hoping that all of the work will be done by Thanksgiving or Christmas.
 Vrooman says although the wall already looks great, there is more that will be done before it’s complete.
 On top of what is there so far will be curved bricks that will go all the way down on top of the wall and on top of the columns.
 She, too, is encouraging people to donate to the project.
 The wall comes with a $160,000 price tag. The committee has $35,000 in hand. Vrooman says the pandemic has hindered the committee’s ability to get out and raise funds the way its members had planned.
 “We think now that the wall is going up and people can see what the vision is that hopefully people would be more inclined to contribute, and certainly no gift is too small and no gift is too large,” she said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted Thursday to condemn racism against Asian Americans tied to the coronavirus outbreak, approving a Democratic resolution on a mostly party-line vote. Republicans called the legislation an election-year effort to criticize President Donald Trump and “woke culture on steroids.”The resolution, approved 243-164, calls on all public officials to condemn anti-Asian sentiment and to investigate hate crimes after a rise in aggression and violence from those blaming people of Asian descent for the pandemic. The measure does not name Trump but notes inflammatory terms used by him and other Republicans — including “Chinese Virus,” “Wuhan Virus,” and “Kung flu” — and says they have perpetuated an anti-Asian stigma.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that “at the same time that the coronavirus pandemic is broken out, so too has a disturbing epidemic of hate and discrimination” against Asian Americans and Asian immigrants, including physical and verbal attacks and vandalized businesses. She blamed Trump for trying to divert attention from Russia’s meddling in elections to demonize China.Rep. Mark Takano, D-Calif., called Republican opposition to the resolution “disgraceful.”“The president is fueling racism and inspiring violent attacks on Asian Americans and Asian immigrants,” Takano said. Trump has often used the term “kung flu” on the campaign trail as he has tried to turn focus to the virus’s origins in China amid criticism of his response to the pandemic.Republicans said Trump was turning his ire toward China’s government and not Asian Americans. Trump in March insisted that Asian Americans were “amazing people” and not at fault for spreading the virus.Several House Republicans spoke against the resolution. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan said it was “just another opportunity to attack the president.” Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs called it “woke culture on steroids.” Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said it was “ridiculous” and a “waste of time” as the House was about to adjourn for the week and Democrats and the White House have so far failed to agree on additional coronavirus relief.“At the heart of this resolution is the absurd notion that referring to the virus as a Wuhan virus or the China virus is the same as contributing to violence against Asian Americans, which I will tell you no one on this side of the aisle supports,” McCarthy said.Anti-discrimination groups have reported hundreds of actions against Asian Americans, especially in the early days of the outbreak. Even before cities began shutting down all restaurants to stop the spread of the virus, Chinese restaurant owners were experiencing steep declines in business because of racial stigma.Asked in March why he called the coronavirus the “Chinese virus,” Trump told reporters at the White House that he doesn’t consider it a racist remark. “It’s not racist at all,” Trump said, adding that he calls it the “Chinese virus” because he wants to be accurate.Copyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Tiger Woods grinded his way to a three-over par 73 in Thursday's opening round of the 120th US Open, putting the 15-time major winner in jeopardy of missing the cut.
 The inconsistent 44-year-old reigning Masters champion made six pars, six bogeys, five birdies and a closing double-bogey at Winged Foot, leaving him at risk of missing the cut for the third time in his past four US Open starts and fourth time in his career.
 "It was a bit of ebb and flow to the round," Woods said. "I did not finish off the round like I needed to. I made a bunch of putts in the middle part of the round.
 "It seemed like most of my drives on the front nine landed in the fairway and ended up in bad spots, and I tried to stay as patient as possible, and unfortunately just did not finish off my round the way I needed to."
 World number 21 Woods has won a record 82 US PGA Tour titles, matching Sam Snead for the all-time record, and for a time he was fighting to make the most of a tough day.
 Woods escaped a greenside bunker to six feet and made the par putt at the par-3 third, but made bogeys at the fourth and fifth before dropping his approach at the sixth to seven feet and sinking the par putt.
 He made bogey at eight after finding dense rough off the tee, then responded with three birdies in a row.
 Woods sank a 30-foot birdie putt at the par-5 ninth, followed with a 24-foot birdie putt at the par-3 10th and added a 19-foot birdie putt at the par-4 11th.
 "The middle part of my round, a lot of things went my way," Woods said. "Beginning part of the round it seemed like things weren't going my way. Good tee shots ended up in the rough in bad spots, and I had a nice little hot run there in the middle part of my round."
 But at 17-foot birdie putt lipped out at the par-5 12th and the magic seemed to vanish with it.
 Woods found a bunker at the par-3 13th to make bogey, went in deep rough at 14 on the way to another bogey and closed bogey-double bogey to fall from within reach of the leaders to well off the pace.
 "Hit a really good putt at 12, thought it was going to go in and then I lipped it out, and then made two bogeys after that," Woods said. "Didn't finish off my round the way I needed to."
 \- 'Long way to go' -
 Woods had no complaints with the set-up at Winged Foot, which had light wind and receptive greens for early starters like Woods until the day heated up.
 "The golf course was set up fantastic. What they did with the hole locations were very fair," Woods said. "It gave us an opportunity to make some birdies, and you look at most of the scores, and the guys took advantage of it.
 "I don't see any reason why it won't get harder and get more difficult. I just think that the golf course is there to be had. They gave us a lot of opportunities."
 Woods hasn't ruled out taking advantage of them and getting back into the hunt.
 "We have a long way to go. This is a long marathon of a tournament," said Woods. "There's a lot of different things that can go on."

Quality issues were found regarding jaggery and Kerala Pappadam distributed as part of the Onam kit, which contained 11 items," the petitioner said in his plea.   The Consumerfed argued, "The entire writ petition is based on the public's use of the kits and not individual use by the petitioner. Test report issued to a third party has been presented as part of the petition and this person has been filing PILs against Consumerfed and is using the petitioner as an instrument to file this petition."

“If it will bring people to Conway and advance our economy, I’m for it,” he said, adding that he thinks Fitzpatrick’s team has at least one other successful brewhouse.
 The only possible problem he sees is possibly not enough parking.
 He also expressed support for Ocean Fish Market.
 “I’d love for the fish market to stay just like it is. I think it’s beautiful, but who am I to tell someone what to do with their property?” he asked. “As long as they stay within the law, that’s where my opinion has to end. I love the aesthetics of the fish market. I think it adds to the charm of Conway.”
 Fitzpatrick’s as yet unapproved plan incorporates Ocean Fish Market into the condominium building.
 Burroughs, president of the Horry County Historical Society, has two concerns about the project: one is preserving the tree in the Kingston Presbyterian Churchyard and the other is seeing a building that fits into Conway’ historic district.
 Burroughs says the condominium building is probably “really good modern architecture” and adds that he’s not an architect.
 “But,” he said, “I look at it and, in some ways, I think that’s a neat looking building. I’m not criticizing somebody’s skill in modern architecture…I actually think it looks kind of good; however…I don’t think it fits on the riverfront of a town that is trying to promote their heritage.”
 He points to the historical aspects of the church and its cemetery.
 “I don’t think a modern architecture building is the right thing beside it,” he said.
 Whatever building goes there needs to have characteristics of the old architecture that would have been around in the early years of Conway or at least when the church was built.
 Burroughs doesn’t want a “fake building” that might look like it was built in 1850, but he said, there are examples of modern architecture that have historical classic elements that “kind of look cool and blend in with those settings.”
 He says examples of this can be found in Charleston and Mt Pleasant.
 Burroughs is also concerned about the huge live oak tree on the Kingston Church property whose canopy flows over the property where Genford is planning its building.
 “There is a huge tree in that cemetery, probably one of the most beautiful live oaks in Conway…,” Burroughs said.
 About half of the tree’s canopy comes onto the property being considered. Burroughs fears that developers might want to cut back some of the tree’s limbs, a terrible mistake that he says arborists have told him will cause each trimmed limb to die all the way back to the tree’s trunk.
 He then turns his attention to the brewhouse building that will sit in the site of an old wharf whose ambience he’d like to see reflected in the new building.
 CAB member Duc Watts says he’s glad to see someone interested in coming into Downtown Conway, and he’s okay with the buildings especially considering that the company has expressed a willingness to work on the historical style of the buildings.
 “We gave them some suggestions,” he said.
 He pointed out that no vote was taken at this past week’s meeting, that it was a preliminary report only to see where they were going.
 “The developers seemed like they really wanted to work with the city,” Watts said. “I think it’d be good for Downtown Conway. They’re (the buildings) not big things, but it’s good. I think it’s good.”
 One of the questions that he thought was left open was exactly where will people park. He says others at the meeting referred to some public parking spaces across the street.
 Genford’s Kingston Commons building isn’t the first effort by developers to build some type of residential building in the area between Kingston Church and Fourth Avenue.
 Several years ago, the city was onboard with a Myrtle Beach developer to build a residential building on the lot closest to Fourth Avenue with plans for it to overlook Kingston Lake; however, developer Van Watts died before building started on the project. Since then the city has bought the property from the Burroughs Company and recently asked companies that wanted to work with the city on this project to submit their qualifications.
 They got a response from Robin Lospinoso with Development Direction LLC to develop a five-story commercial/residential building in that spot.
 Gerry Wallace’s company Mozingo + Wallace Architects, LLC designed the building.
 The plan for that building is to have some commercial ventures on the first floor, possibly a coffee shop, restaurant or even some businesses that will cater to residents of the 36 two-bedroom, two-bathroom residences.
 When Lospinoso and Wallace presented their plan to the city, they weren’t sure if the residences would be condominiums or apartments.
 Wallace said earlier this week that he isn’t sure what schedule that project is on now, adding that he isn’t the developer. He said they are working to figure out the price point at which developers can either sell condominiums or rent apartments and make the construction cost work.
 He said they are continuing to look at the same plan, but said if the Kingston Commons plan is approved, they will have to make a few changes to their plans because the Kingston Commons building goes all the way to the property line, which is allowed in that district.
 That would force Wallace’s group to redesign that end of its five-story building.
 Wallace, who is also a member of Conway’s Community Appearance Board (CAB) said he has recused himself from any decision making on the Kingston Commons project due to his involvement with Lospinoso’s project.
 About the Genford project, he agreed with others who spoke at this past week’s meeting saying, “I thought it was a very good looking building, but slightly out of character with the historic downtown aspect of Conway.”

High-value craft in low-Earth orbit, such as the ISS, could be destroyed by a rogue piece of junk, with the problem so acute that the space outpost might even have to be abandoned if the debris is not cleared out of the way, UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma has warned.
 "Millions of pieces of space junk orbiting the Earth present a significant threat to UK satellite systems, which provide the vital services that we all take for granted - from mobile communications to weather forecasting," said Sharma.
 As he urged mankind to "clean up our act", the official announced new funding to track floating debris, left orbiting the Earth in the wake of a diverse array of missions.
 "If we don't take action now, low-Earth orbit could become too perilous for satellites or even humans on the International Space Station", warned the UK Business Secretary.
 £1million in investment is being channelled via the UK Space Agency (UKSA) towards seven space-cleaning programmes that will be tackling the rogue debris.
 Astronomers estimate that around 160 million pieces of debris are floating around Earth, trapped by the planet's gravity.
 Travelling at a speed of approximately 29,000 km/hour (18,000 mph), almost one million fragments are believed to be larger than 1 cm in diameter and present a devastating threat to satellites in the event of a collision.
 As a graphic example, a close call was cited from 2019, when a spacecraft operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) needed to dodge a £100 million Starlink satellite.
 Furthermore, the experts warn that the impact might trigger a chain reaction that would knock out numerous satellites.
 As there is no way of precisely monitoring small pieces of debris potentially on a collision-course with some pricey space infrastructure, with several mega-constellations due for launch, potential incidents could have catastrophic fallout for life on Earth.

 After he was granted pre-arrest bail on June 26, 2015, Mr. Singh moved the court to quash the FIR. Mr. Singh’s advocate told the court that the “FIR cannot stand scrutiny of law as there is nothing to show that his client had an intention to aid, instigate, abet Sudhir to commit suicide”.
 The advocate said there was an outstanding amount in the name of Mr. Prashant Gawande to the tune of ₹2,32,689, as per the loan account on March 31, 2015. According to the FIR, the day he died, “Sudhir approached the bank for a fresh loan by restructuring the loan account”. The advocate said if that request was refused, “it cannot be held as abetment to Sudhir to commit suicide”.
 The Bench said, “Admittedly, in this case, the loan account of Mr. Gawande was showing an outstanding amount of ₹2,32,689. This aspect is not denied by the prosecution. The deceased was not having any loan outstanding in his name. According to the prosecution, Sudhir went to the Bank of Maharashtra, Morshi branch, Amravati district, for a loan.”
 The court said if the previous loan amount is outstanding and if the branch manager refuses to grant any further loan, “it can be said as an act of a vigilant and prudent banker”.

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's special session on violent crime appeared to reach an end Wednesday, and he didn't get everything he wanted.
   
 The Republican-dominated House called it quits in the early afternoon without voting on five of seven bills the GOP governor had made priorities. The chamber adjourned sine die, so they're not coming back.
   
 Among the rejected ideas were small, technical changes enhancing penalties for adults who give guns to kids or encourage them to commit gun crimes themselves, as well as a highly controversial proposal to let the state Attorney General commandeer St. Louis murder cases from the local circuit attorney.
   
 The House also killed a plan that would have codified a U.S. Supreme Court standard for hearing certain witness testimony and required judges to at least consider trying every juvenile accused of felony gun crimes as an adult.
   
 To the governor's credit, the legislature did pass two bills he called for during the special session, with crime numbers rising in St. Louis, Kansas City and Springfield this year.
   
 One creates the foundation for a new witness protection program Parson says will allow law enforcement to secure more crime-solving tips. The other attempts to make it easier to hire police officers in St. Louis by nixing a rule requiring them to live in the city during their first seven years on the force.
   
 House Republican leadership downplayed their decision to reject the other proposal in a statement released after adjournment.
   
 "We are excited to have passed several significant measures to provide additional resources for law enforcement officers and protect the witnesses against violent criminals," the statement read.
   
 Parson also downplayed the divide.
   
 "You're not going to hit a home run every time in this building," he said in a news conference. "I don't keep score on how many bills I pass and how many I don't."
   
 But Democrats weren't letting them off that easy.
   
 Seth Bundy, a spokesman for Senate Democrats, prefaced an emailed statement from Minority Leader John Rizzo of Independence by noting his boss was commenting on a special session "which began in July, cost taxpayers $200,000, and in which five of his seven proposals failed despite (the governor's) own party controlling both legislative chambers."
   
 Parson also took flak from the campaign of State Auditor Nicole Galloway, who's running to unseat him this fall.
   
 "Republicans' refusal to pass major parts of Governor Mike Parson's agenda shows that he can't even get his own party on board with his so-called law and order campaign message," campaign manager Chris Sloan said in a statement.
   
 House Minority Leader Crystal Quade, D-Springfield, also lamented that so much time went by without considering any bills to prevent violence before it happens or address police brutality that has sparked nationwide protests.
   
 "This legislation would not have prevented a single life from being lost or family from being destroyed," she said.
   
 The two bills the legislature passed may actually have a positive impact, though it's unlikely to be immediate or as far-reaching as policies affecting education and jobs.
   
 Criminologists have told the News-Leader that protecting witnesses is always a good idea and that putting more officers on St. Louis streets could help reduce crime there if they're deployed correctly, preferably in "hotspot" areas where crime is especially prevalent.
   
 The rejected bills had drawn less optimism, though.
   
 Brett Garland, a criminologist at Missouri State University, said the enhanced penalties for adults giving guns to kids "might dissuade a few people here and there from incorporating youth in criminal activity," but said "in the long run, the likelihood is that the impact will be minimal."
   
 Criminal justice expert says that's because the severity of punishment matters far less to criminals than the likelihood they face any punishment.
   
 And Rick Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said letting the attorney general intervene in St. Louis murder cases could get there.
   
 "If the prosecution rate for violent offenses were to increase substantially," he wrote in an email, "that could add to the certainty of punishment and, over time, result in crime reductions."
   
 But Rosenfeld said that also depends on St. Louis police clearing cases for them to charge, which additional prosecutors wouldn't have much to do with.
   
 Rosenfeld also shared Quade's view that police reform is essential right now.
   
 Making it easier to hold police accountable for mistakes and encouraging officers to de-escalate potentially violent situations would boost their law enforcement's standing in key communities and encourage witness cooperation, he said.
   
 Parson, for his part, said that could wait until the regular session in January, frustrating lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.
   
 "Those issues will come, those conversations will take place, but they need to take place in a legislative session, where there's time to deal with it," he said.

Las transacciones de jóvenes entre 18 y 24 años en Linio crecieron 328% en Perú durante la cuarentena (abril-mayo-junio). El resultado es similar en el número de nuevos usuarios, y obedece a que los centennials tienen ya mayor independencia financiera y por lo tanto, toman decisiones de consumo mucho más informadas y analizadas.

Pero no solo crecieron los centennials, la generación de los Baby Boomers registró un incremento de 70%, motivado por las compras de mujeres, que alcanzaron un pico de transacciones en mayo. A nivel regional, el fenómeno de los centennials es incluso mayor, pues el aumento de nuevos usuarios fue de 400%, según Linio. El incremento a triple dígito también se visualiza en las transacciones. Aunque la tendencia es parecida entre hombres y mujeres, el incremento fue de 560% para mujeres, mientras que para los hombres fue de 280% en nuevos usuarios.

“It intrigued me, so I went and met with the city council and planning director and saw what they were trying to do,” he said. “I think Conway’s a nice town. There’s a lot of history here…”
 However, it was a trip up and down the river that left him describing the Waccamaw as “absolutely beautiful” and buying into Conway City Council’s plan to put more focus on the river.
 “Once I got started I said, ‘Let’s just try to do this right,’” Fitzpatrick said.
 Also because two of the people within his team had children who graduated from Coastal Carolina University, he became convinced that coming to Conway was the right thing to do.
 Two buildings are involved in Genford’s plan: one is on the property where the Ocean Fish Market has pleased Conwayites for more than half a century, and the second is planned for three lots owned by the city beside the Bonfire Restaurant.
 The building, drawn to abut Kingston Presbyterian Church, will have seven or eight condominiums, and, perhaps, the Ocean Fish Market. That hasn’t been finalized yet. Fitzpatrick said the building isn’t terribly large, because there isn’t a lot of room for parking.
 A drawing of the building shows a patio with umbrellas where fish lovers can look out over Kingston Lake, hence the possible name of Kingston Commons, as that area was once known.
 Fitzpatrick said his group originally planned to call the development Kingston Landing until Conway historian Ben Burroughs told him that the original Kingston Landing was on the other side of Kingston Church.
 The plan calls for retail on the bottom and a restaurant on the water.
 The second building is what Fitzpatrick calls the riverwalk project. It will include a brewhouse/coffee house and a restaurant and, at this point, has one remaining empty space.
 “The connectivity from the river to the town was important to us,” he said.
 When people pull up to a dock he wants them to be able to have a good view all the way into downtown.
 Fitzpatrick said his company’s goal is to bring people into Downtown Conway by focusing on the river. They’d like to see an increase in the number of floating docks and make the riverwalk the focus it was intended to be, making it a destination for tourists.
 “The best you can do when you do projects like this is study what’s there, learn about the community, but you also have to think about where you want to be in five or 10 years,” he said.
 In the midst of all these plans, Fitzpatrick said they want to grow, but preserve Conway.
 “You can get to the place where it’s not Conway anymore,” he said.
 But, he said, “I think bringing more people back to downtown is actually essential for the long-term health of Conway. Sometimes you have to stick your neck out a little bit.”
 Plans show the brewhouse, that will offer craft beers, having the name of the Tidal Creek Brewhouse. It will have a companion coffee house. He says his company already has this type of business at the Market Common. In Conway, he expects to have equipment that will allow them to make five or six kinds of beer, depending on the season. He already has a good brewmaster. They’ll have food there as well, and perhaps some wine.
 One of Fitzpatrick’s first moves was to introduce some other people to Conway.
 “I brought them up to look at the location, and basically they fell in love with Conway. It’s a very charming place. It really is,” he said.
 When Fitzpatrick began planning for the Conway project, he said there were two things he was particular about. He wanted to preserve the Ocean Fish Market and the live oak tree that’s in the cemetery behind the church.
 “Ultimately, no matter how we think about a city like Conway you have to bring people downtown, and you have to have core people that don’t just come in the morning…and leave in the afternoon,” he sad.
 Fitzpatrick met with Conway’s Community Appearance Board this past week.
 He said the meeting brought some very good comments, intelligent and well thought out, from members of the board and now Genford officials will tweak their plans a little.
 He expects the shape and size of the buildings to stay the same, but designers will continue to work on the details.
 He says they’re very excited to be part of Conway and to help Conway develop.

Donald E. "Don" Hall, Jr.      South St. Georges - Donald E. "Don" Hall, Jr., of South St. Georges, DE, passed away on Wednesday, September 16, 2020.      A life long Delaware resident, Don was a graduate of William Penn High School, and served 4 years in the Delaware Army National Guard. He was a proud union heavy equipment operator with a 51-year membership in the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 542. Don looked forward to the annual 'guys trip' to Cape Hatteras for some surf fishing, competing in local fishing tournaments, crabbing the Wye River, or dropping a line in the canal where he taught his grandsons to fish. A true patriot, he was happy when he could make a purchase of something "Made in the U.S.A.", be it his vehicles, tools, clothes or his toys. Uncomplicated, opinionated yet fair, he captained a life that mattered and his crew will forever miss him.      Don was preceded in death by his parents, Donald E. and Rosa Helen Hall; sister, Judith Hall; and brother, Michael Hall. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Maryjean; daughters, Stephanie Martin and Leneigh Hall; son, Donald Hall; grandchildren, Amanda VanDyke, John VanDyke, Scott Martin and Nicholas Martin; great grandchildren, Deshawn Hall, Terrell Dixon and Sawyer Jean Martin; siblings, James Hall, Pamela Walker, Clifford Hall and Patricia Donophan.
