Soon-to-be, first-year Lake Norman High School volleyball coach Cheznee Dailey now finds herself in an envious position.
 The combination product of both Lake Norman – where she began her own high school-level playing career – and Mooresville High School – where she ended it – will be among the area’s first coaches to be involved in formal season- opening action when the revamped volleyball campaign gets underway in early November. Traditionally a fall season sport at the prep level, volleyball will be among the athletic activities practically across the board experiencing a brand new environment during the scrambled 2020-21 sports school year.
 With much remaining unknown in regards to the impact COVID-19 will continue to make, the NCHSAA made the long-awaited revelation of the scheduled high school sports calendar. It comes complete with the conducting of many sports, among them volleyball, to be held during non-traditional playing seasons.

I've been trying to install the 10 dvd version of the Premium Deluxe Edition for about 9 hours now without success. As stated in the installation manual, after having entered one's activation code, the software launcher should be automatically downloaded. This does not happen. Which in effect means that I cannot start the game. I have installed everything twice from scratch and I got the same result twice. In Microsoft Store I get told 'you own this game' but the only problem is that I can't access it. What a poor show, Microsoft. I've been with Microsoft Flight Simulator since Flight Simulator 4 in 1989 and not once ever has installation been a nightmare of this magnitude. After a glance on the internet, I came across many people having exactly the same (or the same sort of) problem. The game won't launch. We were all looking forward to this moment so much, and now it turns out to be a big disappointment.

There can be no doubt about it, China is now one of the world’s chemical cluster powerhouses. The country’s industrial and manufacturing might will soon be matched by its rapidly advancing chemical clusters, further driving its transition away from lower skilled labour intensive professions towards advanced, high value exports. The global geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions, which are now returning with a vengeance after a cool down period at the turn of the year, look set to become a hugely important market driver in the chemical market and chemical tanker segment across the short, medium and long-term. While much of the focus often remains on the flow of crude oil, the sanctioning of crude oil tankers and the internal and international politics of oil producing states, the complexity and centrality of numerous chemical supply chains to the global economy cannot be understated and deserves perhaps far more attention than it currently receives. It is nigh-on impossible to take the chemical products and tanker section as a homogenous market but the recent political posturing is certain to impact a number of market segments and some of those will be explored in greater detail in the writing.

During the 2016 campaign, a former British spy named Christopher Steele was hired first by a Republican outfit and later by Democratic Party lawyers to dig up dirt on Trump. Steele went on to file various reports about Trump and Russia — some dealt with possible financial entanglements, others touched on possible blackmail material possessed by the Russians, even the existence of the supposed "pee tape." Some of Steele's research was later cited in sealed applications to surveil a fringe adviser on the Trump campaign named Carter Page.

Trump's failure to recall any interactions with Stone during the height of the 2016 campaign is also belied by various contacts between Stone and the Trump campaign documented in the Senate report. The report says the Trump campaign learned about the release of the now-infamous Access Hollywood tape an hour before its release. During that time, the report says, Stone told an associate of his, right-wing writer and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi, to tell WikiLeaks to "drop the Podesta emails immediately," referring to a trove of emails stolen by Russia from the personal account of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. WikiLeaks published the Podesta emails only half an hour after the Access Hollywood tape was published.

Walmart's online sales nearly doubled in the fiscal second quarter, helped by an expansion of its online delivery services. Sales at U.S. locations opened at least a year jumped 9.3%, the company reported Tuesday. Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement chain, reported a 23.4% increase in sales at stores opened at least a year globally, helped by a frenzied pace of do-it-yourself projects. That's almost twice the 12.2% increase that industry analysts had projected.

PLYMOUTH - Once the dream of two long-time friends, the J&M Baseball Academy is now a reality.
 "We've talked about putting something like this together for some time now, and the right pieces all finally fell into place," said Joe Flynn, who runs the business with his former Plymouth North baseball teammate Matt Walsh. "It's great that we were able to finally get this up and going. We put the word out about what we wanted to do and the response was amazing. Better than we could have ever hoped for."
 Flynn and Walsh's plan was to get an 18-and-under club baseball team going in Plymouth this fall to help local high school players get in a little work by playing in AAU tournaments each weekend around the state from September to mid-October. The response exceeded expectations and a 16-and-under squad was added into the mix after players from Plymouth and elsewhere around the South Shore signed up in large numbers for the program.
 The hope is to expand the program to five teams next year and there has also been discussion of holding some indoor training sessions over the winter if a suitable arrangement can be put together.
 "We were trying to come up with a way for some baseball players to get more college eyes on them after they lost this past spring high school season to the pandemic. It's not just the seniors that missed out when everything was canceled. This is also a big time for sophomore and juniors to learn and grow as players and maybe catch the eye of a college coach who'll remember them when it's time to move to the next level," Flynn explained. "The kids needed a chance to show what they can do and to work on their baseball skills.
 "The response has been amazing."
 The teams practice each Wednesday afternoon at either Forges Field or Siever Field in Plymouth. They'll either scrimmage locally on the weekends or travel around the state to play in several scheduled Firecracker or New England Baseball tournaments. Flynn works mainly with the pitchers, while Walsh helps players with their hitting and defense.
 Friends since their days of playing Plymouth Youth Football together, Flynn and Walsh were teammates on the 2008 Plymouth North baseball team that went on an undefeated run to the state championship. They played together for a national baseball title at Franklin Pierce University and each spent some time playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League with the Wareham Gatemen.
 Walsh ended his pro baseball career with a season in the New York Yankees organization and is now an associate head coach and recruiting coordinator with the Franklin Pierce baseball program. Flynn works full-time as a Plymouth firefighter.
 They've also recruited some friends to help them out. Former Plymouth North and UMass Boston standout David Murphy coaches the 16-year-old team and FPU teammates Ryan Boswell and Marc Roche also lend a hand with the training sessions.
 After spending time under the learning tree of Plymouth North's Dwayne Follette and former Franklin Pierce Head Coach Jayson King, Walsh and Flynn seem more than ready to pass along some of their acquired knowledge onto the next generation of baseball players.
 "I think I get more nervous coaching games than I did as a player, but I enjoy passing along some of the things that have been taught to me over the years," Flynn said. "I was lucky enough to have a lot of great coaches help me along the way."
 Spots are still open if you are interested in joining the J&M Baseball Academy. You can find more information on their website at jmbaseballacademy.weebly.com. They are also on Instagram (jmbaseball academy) and Facebook (J&M Baseball).

Carrington was committed to democracy, fundamental human rights and the emancipation of the African people. It was a commitment that went far beyond his official brief as the American Ambassador to Nigeria, a tour of duty he completed in 1997. As he prepared to depart, pro-democracy groups and leaders decided to give him a befitting send forth in the home of Pa Ore Onasanya. But Abacha’s goons invaded the venue and the party was shifted to the home of Chief Ayo Adebanjo, another opposition leader. With the social party in full swing, Abacha’s security forces attacked, but Carrington cared less as he continued dancing. The attackers were running dogs, but they knew better not to bite the American ambassador.

“This has been on my mind for 44 years. That’s a long time,” Jane Carson- Sandler said before giving her testimony.
 Certain triggers can still bring flashbacks to that night in 1976 when DeAngelo confronted her with a butcher knife as she snuggled in bed with her 3-year-old son after her husband left for work at a nearby military base.
 “I hope that he’ll be listening, but we know that during the hearing when he pleaded guilty, he never lifted his head,” she said.
 She is among survivors and prosecutors who contend that DeAngelo is merely masquerading as a feeble old man in a wheelchair.
 Prosecutors cited “his slow gait, the distorted twist of his hands” and his halting answers to Bowman in June. But, they said, his “agile movement and behavior in his jail cell indicate an individual who is healthy and physically active.”

Patients 977 and 978 are both men aged 46 who visited a beef restaurant in Hai Duong Town, the capital of the namesake northern province, that has now become a hotspot linked to 12 known cases.
 The first infected person found there was on August 12, its security guard, 63, whose source of infection is yet to be identified.
 Patient 979 is a 33-year-old woman in Tay Ho District, Hanoi, who visited Da Nang from July 22 to 25. After the central city became the Covid-19 epicenter, her samples were taken for testing and the results came back positive on Monday.
 Patient 980, 37, returned to Vietnam from the Philippines on a repatriation flight that landed in the southern city of Can Tho on August 15. She had to go straight to a quarantine camp where she tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
 Patients 981-983 are people aged 15-90 in Quang Nam Province bordering Da Nang, who got infected from the outbreak in the city.
 With the seven, Vietnam’s Covid-19 count has risen to 983, including 492 active cases and 24 deaths.
 Since July 25, when local transmission returned after three months, 505 people have been diagnosed with the disease in 15 cities and provinces, including 11 each in Hanoi and HCMC.
 Most infections so far are linked to the outbreak in Da Nang, which has 350 cases.
 The global Covid-19 death toll has topped 776,700.

The column informs us that on Jan. 20, 2021, the clock will strike 12:01 p.m. and Trump still will be in the White House. “The street protests will inevitably swell outside the White House, and the ranks of Trump’s private army will grow inside its grounds. The speaker of the House will declare the Trump presidency at an end and direct the Secret Service and Federal Marshals to remove Trump from the premises. These agents will realize that they are outmanned and outgunned by Trump’s private army, and the moment of decision will arrive.” The very succession of government, they write, will rest upon the outcome of battle between Trump’s goon squad and street protesters — unless the military swoops in to save the day.

Some of the more intriguing portions of the film have to do with Capote's borderline obsession with the subjects in "In Cold Blood" and his seemingly neverending attempts at finishing a novel called "Answered Prayers." The latter lost him many close friendships due to his decision to exploit the personal stories of people in his inner circle for his own gain. A finished version of that book never saw the light of day (and some here debate whether he even came close to completing it before his death) but had a serious impact on the final years of his life.

According to the New York Times, many Republicans have been helping West get on the ballot, including Lane Ruhland, a lawyer who has worked for the Donald Trump campaign, and Mark Jaboky, an executive who’s work for the California Republican Party. Jaboky was arrested on voter fraud charges back in 2008 when he was working for the California Republican Party, and he eventually plead guilty to a misdemeanor. Although West hasn't stated it directly, reports say his Republican backing could all be apart of a plan to divert votes away from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
