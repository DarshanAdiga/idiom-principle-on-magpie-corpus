President Donald Trump on Sunday appeared to acknowledge for the first time that Joe Biden won the White House, but made clear he would not concede and would keep trying to overturn the election result. Trump's statements came in tweets that included several baseless claims about the Nov. 3 vote, which state and federal officials say was safe and secure.
 Trump, without using Biden's name, tweeted that “He won,” something Trump had not said before publicly, though he said the Democrat's victory was only “in the eyes” of the media. Biden defeated Trump by winning back a trio of battleground states that switched from the Democratic column in 2016 — Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — and topped the 270 electoral vote threshold to clinch the presidency. Biden so far has 78.8 million votes, the most ever by a winning candidate, to Trump's total — more than 73 million.
 “If the president’s prepared to begin to recognize that reality, that’s positive,” Biden's incoming chief of staff, Ron Klain told NBC's “Meet the Press.” Still, Klain said, “Donald Trump’s Twitter feed doesn’t make Joe Biden president or not president. The American people did that.”
 A Republican governor said “it was good actually” to see Trump's tweet that Biden won. “I think that’s the start of an acknowledgment. ... We want to make sure that there is a smooth transition,” said Arkansas' Asa Hutchinson on NBC.
 The president has previously refused to accept the results of the election and, in a later tweet Sunday, he dug in again, saying, “I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go.” Even while seemingly acknowledging Biden’s victory, he also argued without evidence that the former vice president only won because the election was “rigged.” Trump then made unsubstantiated complaints about access for poll watchers and about vote tabulations and asserted, “WE WILL WIN!” Twitter soon posted warning labels about the tweets.

TWIN FALLS — On a gray, rainy Friday, a family print shop closed its doors after 35 years in business.
 Blip Printers owner Brad Nichols has been working in the shop since he was 10 when it opened back in 1985. His dad, Bill, owned a bartering company, and one day purchased some printing equipment from a Montana church. The store was born after that somewhat random purchase.
 Over the years, Blip — it’s an acronym of Blue Lakes Insta Print — grew. A local real estate magazine and other big print jobs fueled much of that growth. The store purchased more and bigger equipment, including a gargantuan, million-dollar printing press.

 An early 10-0 lead was not nearly enough for the mistake-prone, injury-ravaged San Francisco 49ers to hold on against the Saints.
 Helping out New Orleans when they needed to be error free, the Niners committed four turnovers and lost their third in a row, 27-13, in what has been a frustrating follow-up to their 2019 Super Bowl run.
 The loss dropped San Francisco (4-6) deeper into the NFC West cellar.
 "If we had taken care of the ball better today, we would have had a very good chance to be in that game," coach Kyle Shanahan said. "We blew an opportunity there. Those turnovers are what killed us."
 The 49ers ran 23 plays to the Saints' three in the first quarter and still led 10-3 when a punt bounced off Ken Webster on one hop while he was standing near returner Trent Taylor. The Saints' Marquez Calloway fell on the ball at the 49ers 21, setting up a 2-yard, tying touchdown run from Alvin Kamara.
