Eden Hazard was given a breather against Real Sociedad by Zinedine Zidane, but the French manager is going to deploy the Belgian skipper from the start against Mallorca. Karim Benzema and Rodrygo should partner Eden Hazard in the attacking third. Toni Kroos and Casemiro are in fine form at the moment, and the duo could be joined by Luka Modric to give an attacking edge to their midfield. In defence, there is no looking past the partnership of skipper Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane.
