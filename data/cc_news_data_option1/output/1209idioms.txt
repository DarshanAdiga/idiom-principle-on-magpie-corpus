All English soccer below the three divisions of the fifth tier National League will end immediately due to the coronavirus pandemic with all results from the season expunged, the FA said on Thursday. The top three National League divisions, the Womens Super League and womens championship remain in talks about how best to conclude their seasons.However, with no new teams promoted into those leagues, they could decide to follow suit which would then affect the mens professional divisions. The Premier League and other top level soccer in England is suspended until at least April 30 but the governing bodies have said the current season can be extended indefinitely.The FA and NLS National League System steps three to six have reached a consensus that their 2019-20 season will now be brought to an end, and all results will be expunged, the FA said in a statement. This will mean no promotion or relegation of clubs between NLS steps three to six, and no promotion to NLS step two.The National League, popularly referred to as sponsor Vanarama, comprises a mixture of professional and semi-professional clubs. The FA said all grassroots football was now ended for the 2019-20 season.These are challenging circumstances for English football and all decisions taken are in the best interests of the game and in consultation across key stakeholders, said the FA. Todays steps take into account the financial impact during this uncertain period, whilst considering the fairest method on how the sporting outcomes for the season will be decided with the integrity of the leagues in mind.

Covid-19 and marijuana consumption habits
   
 With the many discussions of how Covid-19 may be shared with by an infected person, marijuana has been left out it seems. Smoking a joint with others as well as taking a big inhale may induce coughing that may spray mouth fluids into the air for some distance. Sharing a pipe will do what? Yikes.
   
 Should there be warnings, health advisories, posted in all locations that are in the state cartel operations? Perhaps the Colorado Department of Health and Environment may wish to chime in? Socializing is a big part of the use of this herb. And, who knows, perhaps, the CBD ingredient in the herb may kill the virus?
   
 Just a thought on a gray, dismal blue day of reality, while waiting for better weather.

 Goodbye, death penalty
   
 Just to prove that conservative thinkers and Donald Trump supporters can be fair minded, I give a shout out to Gov. Jared Polis and his Democrats in Denver for abolishing capital punishment.
   
 First, government is for the purpose of protecting and serving the public. Government can be useful in ways that individualism cannot address ― for instance, the building of roads and hospitals and management of foreign trade. Government's arm should reach no further than removing people who are a grave threat to the public. We already have the resources. Imagine if we had to start by building our first prison.
   
 Second, scripture does not support capital punishment.
   
 Third, all governments are dreadfully susceptible to corruption. The prison system in the U.S. is morphing into a political gulag. Political prisons plus capital punishment equals people being murdered for their opinions. Look at the past 100 years of global Soviet history.

 Board of Regents controversy
   
 Amen to Aaron Harber's column (March 22) calling attention to supporting the Denver District Court Judge Bruce Jones' opinion on the Open Records Act lawsuit filed by the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper. He held that the CU Board of Regents' "interpretation of both the Colorado Records Act and Meetings laws are in conflict with the meaning of the terms."
   
 While it is unclear if the University of Colorado Board of Regents will appeal the decision, I think they would be in serious error to do so. Here's why. In addition to the partisan politics of five Republican Regents circumventing a fair-minded election for CU president, the lawsuit revealed the evil at work behind the scenes by those five Regents.
   
 The judge made it very clear that "the board's interpretation is designed to justify a predetermined outcome, rather than to align with the statutes." Moreover, the public was deprived of the opportunity to compare Mr. Mark Kennedy (who was selected by the board as CU president) to his competitors."
   
 Also, "The public could not evaluate the board's performance in selecting Mr. Kennedy as the only finalist when information regarding his competition was kept secret." This is a Colorado scandal and may remain so as long as Kennedy remains in that post. Frankly, it should remain a scandal until he is removed.
   
 Also, a process of appointing rather than electing CU Regents, like other Colorado colleges/universities, should be adopted.

The two-week stay-at-home directive isn't necessarily about reducing the number of Minnesotans who will be infected with coronavirus, the governor stressed numerous times during his Wednesday remarks. Instead, citing models developed by the Minnesota Department of Health in partnership with the University of Minneosta, Walz said the movement toward stricter social distancing is to "buy time" for Minnesota to ramp up its ICU (intensive care unit) capacity to be better prepared for the coming peak of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and to give Minnesota manufacturers more time to produce more ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers and others who as part of their work are at risk of being exposed to those who are infected. With no additional mitigation efforts, Walz said Minnesota's ICU capacity, according to the models as of today, stand to be overwhelmed by those infected with COVID-19 requiring that level of hospital care.

 Among the many things that got washed out to sea last week in a torrent of coronavirus-related news was most of the media coverage of Sunshine Week. Started by the American Society of News Editors in 2005, Sunshine Week is an annual event promoting the importance of government openness and accountability.
 Understandably, Sunshine Week didn't get as much attention last week as it typically does. However, as we're all adjusting to a new way of living, the principles that the event is intended to highlight are more important than ever.
 All the recent government emergency orders notwithstanding, we're still part of a functioning democracy. That means there's a continued need for openness about what our governments at the local, state and federal levels are doing, in response to this crisis as well as with regard to their other responsibilities.
 Governments are going to have to operate for a period of weeks or even months in a mode in which face-to-face interactions between people are limited or avoided completely. Which makes conducting open meetings a challenge.
 First, we should give credit where credit is due: Some local leaders already were exploring ways to use technology to make government more accessible to their constituents long before the coronavirus hit. These efforts included having video of government meetings available on Facebook or other internet websites.
 That's a good idea, regardless of whether or not people are being encouraged to stay at home. Even under ideal circumstances, not everyone can attend public meetings in person for various reasons. Some people have disabilities that make it difficult for them to participate. Other people have conflicts with their personal or work schedules.
 So kudos to the government agencies that were ahead of the curve in terms of making their meetings accessible electronically. Those that weren't doing that before need to get with the times and start now.
 And we're not just talking about city councils, school boards and county commissions. Other government boards and commissions should make their meetings open to the public electronically.
 It's not all that expensive or difficult to rig up a web cam. And it's essential for citizens to be able to evaluate what their government officials are doing, especially in difficult times such as these.
 It's important to remember, though, that citizens should be able to do more than watch public meetings. They also should have opportunities to speak out on the issues that are meaningful to them.
 It isn't sufficient to ask people interested in particular topics to submit their comments via email or some other format before government meetings begin. Few of us have psychic powers, so it's not always possible to comment intelligently on what might happen.
 And that's the tricky part to all of this. Citizens need to be able to comment on what they see and hear during those meetings in something close to real time. Within reason, of course.
 Just as people attending Pueblo City Council meetings in person don't have the unfettered right to blurt out their thoughts at any point during council discussions, there should be some reasonable limits on how and when virtual comments will be collected.
 There should be some mechanisms in place for officials who sit on those governmental agencies to see emails or direct messages from people who are watching their meetings. And share those messages with the public as well.
 That wouldn't be a perfect solution. There are some people who don't have access to the technology they would need to participate in meetings electronically.
 But we aren't in a perfect situation, either. Government officials should take the steps necessary to make their meetings available to as many people as might possibly have interest in seeing and commenting on them.
 Social distancing and public participation in our governmental process aren't mutually exclusive.

The coronavirus is taking a growing toll on the U.S. military, and commanders and senior officials are bracing for worse. From nuclear missile fields at home to war zones abroad, from flight lines to ships at sea, the Pentagon is striving to shield vital missions even as it faces urgent calls for help on the civilian front. Training exercises big and small, including one of the largest in Europe since the end of the Cold War, have been curtailed. Army recruiting stations have closed. Troops around the globe are hunkering down to confront an enemy, unlike anything the worlds most lethal armed forces have encountered before.Its unprecedented in my lifetime, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said, adding that he believes that in a period of months the worst will be over and the force will once again be fully mission capable. Until then, the ramifications of COVID-19 for the military are likely to expand. There are worries, for example, about the defense industry being weakened and key weapons development slowed. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says that in a worst-case scenario, the military will lose some of its preparedness for combat and other missions. But the impact is likely to be moderate to minor to low in terms of its risk to national defense, he told reporters on Monday.Im just not in a place right now where I can give you an accurate description of what thats going to look like, he said. The Pentagon budget also is taking a hit, although a coronavirus relief bill working its way through Congress would provide billions for the growing list of new expenses, including loans to industry that would enable accelerated production of medical equipment like ventilators and respiratory masks for civilian use.Many of Americas closest allies are waging their own COVID-19 battles, including Britain, Germany, Italy, France, and other NATO partners, as well as South Korea, which hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops. At least temporarily, the pandemic has taken the edge off conflict in some of the globes major flashpoints, such as Iran, as governments focus on fighting the disease inside their own borders. Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, which is accustomed to responding to single-event domestic natural disasters like a flood or hurricane, said the coronavirus outbreak is akin to having hurricanes of varying ferocity hit every U.S. state and territory, as well as the District of Columbia.This is a historic event that will require a historic response, Lengyel said. The Guard has been mobilized by every state governor and in three territories. In Washington, California and New York the federal government is footing the bill. As of Wednesday, more than 10,000 Guard members were on duty. The active-duty military also is helping, with three field hospitals deploying to New York and Washington, and Navy hospital ships expected in Los Angeles and New York.The Guard is chipping in with a range of expertise, including what it calls weapons of mass destruction teams that are helping set up drive-thru testing stations. No U.S. military member is known to have died from COVID-19, although infections are spreading.Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs, the top doctor on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday it appears highly likely that the spread inside the military will continue. Over the next three weeks, which he said is as far ahead as modeling data can reliably support a forecast, we think were going to see this no surprise continue to grow. His comment aligns with those of many others in the medical community and across the military, standing in contrast to President Donald Trumps statements about starting to return the country to normalcy by Easter. As of Thursday, 280 of the 1.4 million-strong active-duty force had been confirmed with the disease, up from 51 a week earlier.Our curve is not flattening, Friedrichs said. The virus has penetrated the Pentagon, but with modest impact thus far as Esper and Milley remain at work in the military headquarters. As a precaution, Esper and the deputy defense secretary, David Norquist, are being kept physically separated. On Monday, the buildings health risk alert level has raised a notch, and on Wednesday Esper ordered the higher alert level for all Defense Department sites worldwide.In a virtual town hall meeting with Defense Department employees, Esper on Tuesday said his top priority is protecting troops and their families, but he noted that the military cannot function free of risk.

The Denver Broncos signed unrestricted free agent quarterback Jeff Driskel to a two-year contract Thursday.
 Financial terms were not released.
 Driskel, who turns 27 next month, started three games with the Detroit Lions last season and will compete for the backup job in Denver behind incumbent starter Drew Lock.
 A sixth-round pick by the San Francisco 49ers in 2016, Driskel appeared in nine games (five starts) with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2018.
 For his career, he has completed 167 of 281 passes (59.4 percent) for 1,688 yards with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions. He has rushed 47 times for 281 yards and three scores.
 The Broncos released veteran quarterback Joe Flacco last week. Brett Rypien, undrafted out of Boise State in 2019, is the only other QB on the roster.

Dozens of organizations have sent letters to provincial and federal officials asking them to release non-violent inmates and people in remand centres awaiting trial.
 They have also suggested granting some inmates early parole, as well as releasing all youth, asylum seekers and immigrants in custody.
 Alberta is allowing people who serve jail time on weekends to self-isolate under house arrest, says Hart-Dowhun. It's also assessing cases of youth in custody who could be sent home.
 Ontario announced this month that intermittent inmates serving on weekends will be granted temporary absences and the Ontario Parole Board can use alternatives to in-person meetings. The province's correctional services can also issue temporary absences beyond the current 72-hour maximum and early release will be granted to some inmates nearing the end of their sentences.
 In Quebec, civil rights group Ligue des droits et libertes says prisoners who are sick or elderly, who are near the end of their sentences, who are pregnant, who are in immigration detention centres and those awaiting trial for non-violent crimes should be freed.
 Spokeswoman Lucie Lemonde said in a statement Thursday that the only measure proposed so far -- the suspension of intermittent sentences -- is inadequate.
 "What we are hearing from inside is alarming," she said, citing a lack of masks and protective gear for staff, a failure to distribute soap in one provincial jail and double occupation of cells.
 "It's simple. To avoid a catastrophe, the release of prisoners must be accelerated."
 In an open letter earlier this week, the Canadian Prison Law Association says Ontario's measures need to happen all over Canada.
 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acknowledged Wednesday that prisoners are at higher risk of contracting and spreading the virus, but did not say whether federal officials have been in contact with provinces about a nationwide plan.
 Sen. Kim Pate, a former executive director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, says it's important to look at implementing those measures across the board to improve safety for inmates and the public.
 "It would require co-operation of every province and territory, as well as the federal government to roll it out throughout the country."
 Pate says there is also a section of the Criminal Code that allows the federal cabinet to grant prisoners who aren't deemed a public safety threat a conditional pardon and immediate release.
 So far, federal officials have not said whether it is being considered.
 Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said in a statement Wednesday that the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) is taking preventive measures to keep staff and inmates safe, but he did not provide specifics.
 "CSC continues to examine available options in collaboration with the Parole Board of Canada," he said. "As COVID-19 impacts countries around the world, the response from our government and agencies will continue to evolve as needed to keep Canadians safe."
 Pate says she has heard concerns that if conditions don't improve, there could be prison riots similar to those in Italy, where at least six inmates died.
 "My hope would be that we do not get to that stage in Canada as it has in other countries where these issues were ignored."
 Pamela Palmater, a Mi'kmaq lawyer and chair of Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University, says the H1N1 outbreak in 2009 shows that Indigenous communities suffer higher infection and death rates.
 To make matters worse, she adds, they are also disproportionately incarcerated.
 "The fact that the major of federal and provincial governments have not communicated a comprehensive pandemic de-incarceration plan for Indigenous people is completely irresponsible," Palmater says.
 She says Indigenous people in prisons also have higher rates of autoimmune diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C, which could cause serious health complications if they contract COVID-19.
 "The last thing we need is … COVID-19 to break out," Palmater says.
 "It risks the lives of these prisoners who are not there on a death sentence."

Watch closely what is hidden from view. While there is an enormous amount of speculation and studied hypotheses concerning this coronavirus, do not allow the virus hype to cause blindness to the government’s hidden agendas and methods of achieving dominance over the populace. Things are moving very quickly, and every single piece of new legislation, every executive order, and all mandated tyrannical measures instituted at any level of government could have very dangerous underlying consequences, and these will most likely not see the light of day in any mainstream media. That is why it is so important to seek out those that are researching these documents and tyrannical measures, and reporting on them outside the mainstream. In addition, the asinine social changes are not going away anytime soon, so get prepared for normal life in this new surveillance state of America to be one giant TSA center intent on inspecting and controlling all movement and action of the public. In other words, life in this country could become one big airport security line, and pat downs and the metaphorical equivalent (or not) of body cavity searches could become the norm.

An offer by one of the worlds biggest porn sites to stream its top service for free was condemned by critics as a move to exploit the coronavirus crisis and silence complaints that videos on its platform featured sex trafficking victims.Pornhub, a streaming platform for sexual content, has come under fire for allegedly failing to remove images and videos of child rape and sexual abuse on the site - claims it denies. An online petition to shut the site - which had over 42 billion visits in 2019 - now has over half a million signatures.As cities globally locked down this week to stop the spread of coronavirus, Pornhub said it would let users watch its top product for free for 30 days, with its traffic already rising 11.6 worldwide since the pandemic confined workers to home. Pornhub ... will offer Pornhub Premium to the entire world in an effort to encourage the importance of staying home and practicing social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, a Pornhub spokesman said in a statement.Data from the site showed a free trial offered to Europe before being offered globally this week had spurred a 57 spike in traffic from Italy, the worst-hit European country for coronavirus, a 38 increase in France and 61 in Spain. Along with more clicks, however, have come renewed complaints about the video-sharing platform and questions about whether all the content available online is consensual.Pornhub, owned by Luxembourg-headquartered company MindGeek, denies allegations of knowingly running any content that is sexually abusive and rejects calls for tighter regulation. The measures we take make us far more regulated than any other major user-generated platform, said a Pornhub spokesman.Any allegation that we arent taking this seriously is categorically false. He added that Pornhub denied as categorically false any suggestion there was evidence of sex trafficking on the site.Critics, however, have raised concerns the site is open to abuse and exploitation and increased traffic could exacerbate that. Theyre making a lot more money and getting a lot more traffic, said Laila Mickelwait, director of religious anti- trafficking organization Exodus Cry, who posted the petition aimed at shutting down Pornhub.Theres going to be more exploitation, theres going to be more demand, more users and then more videos uploaded to the site. The platform allows anyone with an account to post content. Content is then checked by human moderators and automated technologies.Womens rights experts have urged governments for tighter regulation to tackle abuse online and accused Pornhub of failing to act quickly enough to remove content when reported. It is therefore important for governments to put in place and implement strong laws that put a duty of care on tech platforms, said Tsitsi Matekaire, who runs an End Sex Trafficking program at womens rights group Equality Now.Internet Watch Foundation IWF, which identifies and removes child sexual abuse imagery online, said it found 118 cases of child abuse on Pornhub from 2017-2019 but that this number was low and Pornhub quickly removed this content. Everyday sites that you and I might use as social networks or other communications tools, they pose more of an issue of child sexual abuse material than Pornhub does, said IWF spokeswoman Emma Hardy.

 This continues a long run of issues for Jones that started in 2012 when he was arrested for driving under the influence in New York. Three years later, he ran a red light, causing a crash.
 Jones has also failed multiple drug tests conducted by the UFC, twice losing his title without being defeated. He was released Thursday and is expected to appear in court on a bond arraignment hearing April 9.

Ryan Prickett still has plenty of work to do. He just isn't spending time in press boxes this spring.
   
 Prickett, a Salina native and a Sacred Heart graduate, is in his 15th year as sports information director at Fort Hays State University, has seen his schedule change due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of keeping statistics at a baseball game at Larks Park, Prickett is working from home as part of a university-wide shutdown of being on campus.
   
 "The events themselves, it's weird not having those," said Prickett, who is in charge of overseeing 18 sports at FHSU. "That's really the main thing that changes my job quite a bit."
   
 Prickett, his assistant and his graduate assistant started working from home on Thursday, a week to the day after the collegiate sports world turned upside down. On March 12, the day before the FHSU women's basketball team was to start play in an NCAA regional in Warrensburg, Mo., Prickett left Hays that morning for the tournament, keeping an eye on his email as he made his way eastward across the state. The NBA had just suspended its season and Prickett had a feeling the NCAA would be next. Prickett had just gotten past Lawrence when he got an email that the NCAA Championships had been canceled.
   
 "That was a weird feeling," Prickett said.
   
 The MIAA also announced that day that spring sports would be suspended, effective at the end of the day. FHSU was playing baseball at Larks Park and the softball team was on the road. So Prickett made stops in parking lots along the way back to Hays to write news releases about the end of spring sports, as well as game recaps for baseball and softball.
   
 "It was a really unique day," Prickett said.
   
 The MIAA later canceled all spring sports. With no spring sports to update, Prickett is able to get a head start on planning for upcoming sports that he normally would put off until later. He is working under the assumption there will be sports in the fall, but added the future is uncertain. The health of fans and athletes alike takes precedence.
   
 "With the way things are going right now, who even knows what the future start date is to get back to normal," Prickett said. "That's the great unknown right now. That's the scary thing; we could get going again and all of a sudden there is a flareup again, we shut everything down again."
   
 Members of the FHSU athletic department are taking the ever-changing events in stride, Prickett said.
   
 "I think everybody is taking it pretty seriously," Prickett said. "I think the mood has been a quiet calm. We're just kind of rolling with the punches right now. Once we get new information, we get together and talk about what we're going to do going forward."
   
 Prickett is keeping busy, but he admits he misses seeing Tiger athletes in action.
   
 "I definitely miss the games," Prickett said with a laugh. "That's part of the job I really find enjoyment in.
   
 "It's tough," he added. "It's just not our sports. It's the professional sports world, all of the college sports. It's just a weird deal right now, not being able to see any kind of live sports going on."

OTTAWA -- Canada and its G7 counterparts are concerned about the spread of disinformation in the COVID-19 fight, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois- Philippe Champagne said Thursday, stressing the need for a co-ordinated world response based on science.
 Champagne was speaking the day after he and his G7 counterparts were able to speak via video conference to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo following President Donald Trump's heavily criticized pledge this week to end the American pandemic lockdown by Easter Sunday, April 12, for the good of the U.S. economy.
 Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to denounce the "Lamestream Media" for trying "keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success." Days earlier he told Americans to practice social distancing and stay at home to prevent the virus from spreading.
 In an interview with The Canadian Press, Champagne said he and his counterparts stressed the need to rely on science to make proper decisions in combating the outbreak now, and in the post-virus recovery phase.
 "A lot of the talk we had was around co-ordinating our actions around the coronavirus," Champagne said when asked about the discussion with Pompeo. The group affirmed the need to "ensure essential people can cross borders, that global supply chains still function, and we have air bridges."
 Champagne said he and his fellow ministers stressed the need to act in tandem and support international institutions, including the G20, whose leaders met Thursday by teleconference.
 "What I'm concerned is about disinformation," Champagne said.
 "We need to speak with one voice to say that we need to stick to science, we need to work with the multilateral organizations. We need, as the world democracies, as the West to strengthen the institutions that embody the international rules-based order."
 Champagne didn't mention Trump by name, but he stuck to the foreign-policy line that the government has maintained to navigate the actions of the mercurial U.S. president who has shown disdain for world bodies, ranging from the United Nations, NATO, the World Trade Organization and others.
 "Whether it's the UN system or the World Health Organization …
 we need to be behind them. But also the G7, that we have a role to play, that we combat disinformation at a time when we need to inform citizens."
 The G7 ministers also discussed the need to ensure the free flow of key medical supplies and research towards developing a vaccine against the virus, Champagne said.
 "When it comes to science and making sure we work together towards a vaccine these initiatives are already ongoing. If there was a time in history, where we need to co-ordinate, consult and co-operate, this is the time," he said.
 In his daily briefing on Thursday, Trudeau defended Canada's decision to send 16 tonnes of medical equipment to China in February to help it cope with the initial COVID-19 outbreak. He said it was part of Canada's response to a global crisis.
 "I can assure everyone that the federal stockpiles have been sufficient to meet the needs of the provinces until this point," Trudeau said, adding that in the coming days the government would be receiving "millions more items" that are needed.
 He said Canadian businesses "are tooling up production to make sure that we have enough, not just for Canadians, but for friends and allies around the world who need it."
 When the initial outbreak occurred in China, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, said the World Health Organization asked other countries to help China with medical supplies in a bid to contain the spread of cases.
 "I think it is a very important public health principal, which is containment at source is the most important thing one must do at the beginning of any outbreak because by helping the initial epicentre you're going to help the world, you're going to help Canada as well," Tam said Thursday.
 Trudeau also met on Thursday with his fellow G20 leaders via video conference to discuss further co-ordination.
 "We can only overcome COVID-19 if we take action together as a global community," said Trudeau. "That means making sure the World Health Organization and our public health agencies have the resources they need. It means working together to develop a vaccine, identify treatments and increase testing."
 Meanwhile, flights for Canadians stranded abroad are continuing into next week, but Champagne said it is becoming harder to sustain them.
 "Countries are facing more and more airspace closures, border closures, airport closures, and so it's becoming increasingly difficult," he said.
 "Countries are taking very severe measures in their countries to restrict the movement of people, to protect the health and safety of all citizens. So, we will continue, but it's true it's becoming increasingly difficult."
 Champagne has said previously that not every stranded Canadian who wants to return will be able to do so. Global Affairs Canada has said it will offer consular assistance to Canadians who remain in foreign countries.
 This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 26, 2020.
