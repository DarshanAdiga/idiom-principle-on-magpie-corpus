The first deer I ever saw up close was again at Bayou Meto, a buck that a hunter was dragging out of the woods. I touched it with a mixture of awe and disbelief. Not until November 1988, at age 25, did I kill my first deer. It was on family property near Vilonia when the Arkansas hunting regulations were printed on a tri-fold sheet that you could stuff in your pocket. I killed my second deer in 2001 on Vernon Schmitz's farm near Linn, Mo.

"The arithmetic will determine a lot of what happens after the election next May," said Prof Roger Awan-Scully, from the Wales Governance Centre.
 "If we see one party very close to a majority then that's a very different context than if you have three parties with around about 20 seats each.
 "In the latter case, then I think all sorts of traditional ways of doing coalition negotiations may be up for grabs and you could see parties trying to think creatively, pushing say for some of the key ministries, or maybe we do have even the possibility of a rotational arrangement whereby perhaps halfway through the term of the next Senedd there's a swapping around of some of the jobs, including maybe the key role of first minister.
 Speaking to the BBC's Politics Wales programme, Prof Awan-Scully explained that the advantage of such an arrangement for the parties involved would be that neither is seen as the junior partner in a coalition.

So to be clear. The Volusia School Board voted to reopen schools in August at full capacity as if the coronavirus does not exist and putting students and school personnel at full risk. What are they thinking?
   
 I trust members of the board will visit classrooms regularly and mingle with both staff and students to assure them it's all safe. I assume the board will put out a statement to parents assuring them their children have nothing to worry about. I assume the sign on the front door of the school district building limiting access to only three people at a time will come down as will the Plexiglas barriers with their personnel?
   
 I assume the board is OK with not following CDC guidelines and ignoring social distancing, etc. I assume they are willing to take personal responsibility for every child and employee who gets ill? And I assume they are OK with the inevitable lawsuits that will come their way soon after school resumes.
   
 Why is it other states are studying a combination of staggered classes, virtual learning and other options and we are content to just bring everyone back as if it were 2019 and see what happens. Our kids, our grandkids, our teachers and school personnel deserve better than this.

 Virus response fumbled
   
 As Florida's coronavirus cases continue to explode at a geometric rate, I can only stand in utter disbelief of the state and federal government's bedraggled response to the crisis. The reopening of our society has been a hurried and misguided debacle, and now we are paying the price.
   
 Even the simple, common-sense acts of donning a mask and social distancing have become the subjects of a ridiculous culture war. In Saturday's conference, Gov. DeSantis appeared on camera alone -- unflanked by his aides - while he bucked the science and assured us everything is fine. Politicians like DeSantis preach personal responsibility because it allows them to abrogate their own duties to guide us down the right path. They gaslight and deflect because the true nature of this pandemic reveals them to be incompetent.
   
 We should be wearing masks. We should be social distancing. The current "wide open fun" approach to business here in Volusia County puts us all at risk. I know locking down for a second time is not a good option, but at the very least, residents and visitors need to be strongly encouraged to wear masks and employ social distancing. Politicians need to get up the gumption to make it happen and stop waiting for someone higher up to make the tough decisions.
   
 Our nation's fumbling of the pandemic is a global embarrassment to us all.

 So glad to see the News-Journal published an article detailing some of John Bolton's criticism of President Donald Trump. Like the president hasn't had enough to deal with from the ever-critical Democrats. If all the Trump-haters in this country want to keep this nation from being completely torn apart by antifa, Black Lives Matter and other far-left radicals, they better think twice about which party is the party of law and order, and will hopefully prevent these nihilistic radicals from destroying the country most of us love.
   
 Trump isn't perfect, but what he offers is a lot more promising for the future than anyone or anything the Democrats have to offer. Of course nothing rational matters if you think this country is intrinsically evil. If you do, rather than assist in the destruction of our beautiful nation, why not take up residence in another country. There are plenty of options. And leave this country to those of us who love it.

I've well and truly converted to facial oils after being a long-time oil phobe (you can read all about that ill-founded fear here) and this is one of the best. It's super hydrating thanks to the squalane, isn't greasy and the vitamin C gives my cheeks a lovely natural glow. The formulation of this oil is to die for, using science-backed actives such as Biossance's hero ingredient squalane, which is made from 100 per cent plant-based renewable sugarcane and locks in even more moisture than hylauronic acid. There's a lot of confusion about when you should apply a face oil and the official advice I got from the brand's president Catherine Gore earlier this year was to use it as the last part of your skincare routine. So whack it on after you've toned, applied your serum, moisturised and popped on your eye cream to lock all the goodness in and help it absorb better. From July 1 there is also a super cute limited edition pink bottle as part of a collaboration with mega influencer Aimee Song if you're into chic packaging for your bathroom #shelfie like I am.

For starters, the Robeson County 4-H Program is the first in the state of North Carolina to have an app. I guess you could say, we are the first to plant the seed. We needed to plant this seed, because about a year ago, the state switched to a new online registration system for 4-H, which meant getting rid of the paperwork. On one hand this is great, because it takes a lot of room for storage and sometimes chasing folks down to fill out the paperwork becomes a logistical nightmare for everyone involved. Now everyone can register for 4-H from the convenience of their computers or mobile devices. It's a great system except for one little thing, when we send out an email, the system sometimes drops the email addresses with no rhyme or reason. That makes communicating difficult. We used our blog, emails, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Remind. That became too difficult for people to find and for us to continue generating. We did what we teach our youth to do and problem solved. Hence the app. On the 4-H app, not only can you see what is going on, you can get push notifications as reminders and see all of our social media with the touch of a button. That makes communication easier for everyone.

 On the crowdfunder, it said: "Competing will come at a cost that the Club could never have budgeted for. We have to test all players and backroom staff for Covid-19 a minimum of four times and invest in specialist PPE equipment.
 "We have to undertake deeper cleaning and pay for travel to matches home and away. And we need to bring players and coaches back off furlough in order to work for the Club.
 "To get up and running and competing in the first play-off will cost around £18,000 and it would cost a further £17,000 to get us through the semi-final and to play in the final. A total of £35,000 to play in matches that are all behind closed doors with no paying spectators, no bar revenue and no sponsorship."

Arsenal make the trip to Bramall Lane today to take on Sheffield United in the FA Cup, where they will hope to become the second team to qualify for the semi-final.
 Manchester United booked their place in the last four with their extra-time victory over Norwich City, but both of the sides today would likely prefer to wrap up proceedings in the 90 minutes.
 Both Sheffield United and Arsenal have played three times since the restart only 11 days ago, and while we will both be keen to take a shot at winning the trophy, both sides are likely to rotate.
 The visitors come into the match on the back of a 2-0 win over Southampton on Thursday, but with back-to-back defeats before that, they do not have the best form to fall back on.
 The Blades are one of very few teams with worse results since the restart however, having yet to score a single goal in their three matches, whilst conceding six, including two consecutive 3-0 losses this week.
 The confirmed teams will be really interesting for this one, as the sides could well see the FA Cup as their best chance of securing European football for next season, with both having dropped down to occupy eighth and ninth in the Premier League division at present.
 With a larger roster of players expected to be used today, the players outside the immediate starting XI for Arsenal should have a distinct advantage over our rivals, and while I’m not brimming with confidence in our side of late, our opponents are very much worse at the moment.
 I’m going to go with a comfortable win today, and am even calling for another clean sheet.
 I wouldn’t expect many teams to have lost 3-0 in three consecutive outings before, but that is the feeling I have going into the cup encounter.
 Will Sheffield United save some key players for their visit of Tottenham on Thursday in the league? Should Arsenal prioritise the cup or Premier League at this point?
