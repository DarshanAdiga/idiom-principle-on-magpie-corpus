“That was a challenge in general, because with every cruise, we’re used to running on and off to get last-minute supplies, and running to Home Depot or West Marine,” she said. “And we couldn’t do it. We had to be extremely organized with all our planning.”
 Similarly, life at sea during the weeks of the cruise had to be more regimented than usual. Scientists on the CalCOFI cruise work day or night shifts, with 12 hours off and 12 hours on. Under normal circumstances, they work together closely while on duty and spend free time socializing, watching movies and sharing meals. This time, meals were on 15-minute rotations, with just a few people eating at once. The common area was closed, and even laboratory space was rationed, with a limited number of researchers allowed at one time, Lilly said. They wore masks around the clock, except in their staterooms.
 Crew members made the best of it, sometimes taking meals together, at a distance, on the deck, or competing in an outdoor cribbage tournament, Lilly said.
 It’s too early to tell what the data will show about the state of the ocean this year, she said, though physical water conditions appeared typical. As far as marine life, Lilly said, they saw a fair number of whales and dolphins around the Channel Islands but few elsewhere.
 In her samples, the water was green with phytoplankton — plant-like microorganisms — indicating high productivity in the sea. They also saw a lot of pyrosomes: free-floating, bioluminescent colonial organisms that are genetically identical and form a structure to filter phytoplankton from seawater.
 “They’re gelatinous, long, pink tubes that float along at the surface of the ocean and appear in these large blooms,” Lilly said. “We didn’t see too many of those blooms, but our zooplankton nets brought back a lot of their young states.”
 These appeared en masse during “the blob,” a mass of warm, stagnant water that appeared off the Pacific Coast around 2014. Last year’s CalCOFI cruise also spotted many of the ethereal, tube-like organisms, and scientists are working to understand why they are so abundant, and what that reveals about current ocean conditions.
 “I think the green waters and the pyrosomes are probably related, that the pyrosomes are taking advantage of this high productivity,” she said.

Over the years, annuals have tried to push them off the pedestal, with constant color, more and unique varieties and accommodating the current interest in container gardens. Shrubs, too, have grown in popularity with the introduction of many new varieties, selected for prolific bloom, showy foliage, quick maturity and compact size easy to use in smaller landscapes and as part of perennial gardens.
 Personally, I wouldn’t do without any of the three. I started as a purist for perennials, believing that careful plant selection will provide both year around beauty and a collection that could be built over time instead of starting from scratch every spring. It works in theory, but all perennials need some maintenance, whether deadheading or weeding during the growing season, dividing and restraining spreaders or simply cutting back the frost- killed plant tops in the fall or early spring.
 Annuals alone are color-packed and exciting, but expensive and labor intensive to plant each spring unless you’re working with a very small space.
 Mature shrubs and trees have a grace and beauty all their own, but these too require some care and maintenance pruning, and tend to be a subtle presence for long parts of the season.
 I like to use the woody plants for structure, especially in winter, and as a backdrop during their quiet time in midsummer. Perennials provide constant and amazing waves of seasonal change that make every venture into the garden an opportunity for discovery. Annuals bring a constant of summer color that the seasonal movements can revolve around, and a chance to try something different and new every season without having to start a new planting bed.
 Combined, they provide the materials for the balanced landscape.

TORONTO - NHL general managers left their annual March meetings in Florida filled with optimism.
 The salary cap was projected to hit at least US$84 million in 2020-21 — a bump of $2.5 million from the current season — and had the potential to rise to $88.2 million if the NHL Players' Association maxed out the escalator clause in the collective bargaining agreement.
 The playoffs were just over the horizon. GMs were mapping out plans for free agency, the draft and beyond.
 That, as the saying goes, was then. And the "now" looks a whole lot different than anyone could have imagined 6 1/2 months ago thanks to the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.
 The NHL got the current season back up and running this summer in the hub cities of Toronto and Edmonton without fans after the schedule was suspended March 12, but with little revenue coming through the door, teams are facing harsh, new economic realities.
 The cap is slated to remain at US$81.5 million for the foreseeable future, and it's likely a number of franchises will look to go below that number in actual dollars spent.
 So how does that impact the job of the NHL's 31 GMs with the draft set for Oct. 6 and 7, and free agency slated to open two days later on Oct. 9?
 "It's unprecedented," said Brad Treliving of the Calgary Flames. "It's a significantly different world. There'll be lots of activity, there'll be lots of discussion. It'll take some work, no question, but that's the job in front of us is."
 Toronto Maple Leafs GM Kyle Dubas said the speed at which everything will transpire after the Stanley Cup is handed out at an empty Rogers Place in Edmonton will be fascinating.
 "It's really tough to project," he said. "The unknowns right now are at a level still far beyond hockey."
 Dubas made the first big move of the off-season — teams eliminated from the playoffs are allowed to trade with each other — when he shipped winger Kasperi Kapanen to the Pittsburgh Penguins as part of a package that saw Toronto grab a prospect, the No. 15 pick in the draft and, perhaps most importantly, some much-needed cap space.
 "It's uncharted territory for all of us," said Montreal Canadiens GM Marc Bergevin, who secured the services of backup goalie Jake Allen in a trade with the St Louis Blues last month before acquiring defenceman Joel Edmundson from the Carolina Hurricanes over the weekend. "With the cap being flat and without knowing when teams will be able to have fans in the stands, with revenues, it affects the salary cap.
 "It's not something that we're making up. It's just reality. Everybody's going to have to take a hit."
 Big names set to potentially hit the market as unrestricted free agents include St. Louis defenceman Alex Pietrangelo and Arizona Coyotes winger Taylor Hall. They will be hot commodities, but it's hard to project where term and dollar amounts will fall in such an uncertain period.
 "There's not going to be a lot of liquidity in the system," Philadelphia Flyers GM Chuck Fletcher said. "It's going to be interesting how free agents approach that, how teams approach that. You might see more hockey trades — dollar for dollar trades — where teams need to improve or need to upgrade in certain areas and you don't have the ability maybe to go into the UFA market. You'll have to be creative in finding solutions with other teams.

Toronto has submitted a new business plan in its bid to return to Super League under LiVolsi's ownership. A decision is expected later this month or in early October.
 Hunter said he and other team officials are currently going over Super League/RFL questions on the business plan and LiVolsi — with the answers due Tuesday.
 Toronto has been actively lobbying for a return to Super League, asking players and supporters to speak up on social media while talking to Super League owners behind the scenes.
 "It really is for us to convince them that Carlo — and I know he does — has the sustainability to sort of ride the wave of pro sports," said Hunter. "Those kind of conversations are taking place all the time."
 The Wolfpack started play in 2017, earning promotion from the third-tier League 1 and second-tier Championship. Toronto debuted in the elite Super League this year, recording six straight losses before the season was halted in mid-March due to the pandemic.
 The league has since resumed play before empty stands with 11 teams — 10 from England and France's Catalan Dragons.

"It's going to be very interesting."
 Winnipeg Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff said he expects to see some restricted free agents across the league who would have normally been tagged with qualifying offers cut loose.
 "There will be some interesting decisions and some interesting discussions — some decisions that some organizations are going to be faced with that they didn't anticipate," he said. "There are going to be some tough decisions, certainly in our organization, but in other organizations as well."
 Leafs defenceman Tyson Barrie appeared to be looking at a significant payday as a UFA at this time last year after being acquired from the Colorado Avalanche. But a difficult season coupled with the pandemic has him facing a very different future compared to 12 months ago.
 He's also keeping his situation in perspective.
 "Whatever I thought was the case before has obviously changed, and it's changed for a lot of people in a lot of worse ways than myself," Barrie said. "I've just got to be grateful and happy with the position that I'm in and that I get to play a game for a living.
 "Moving forward it'll be a little different than it probably would have looked, but that's all right. Everyone's got to adjust."
 While stars will get scooped up regardless of the economic conditions, Washington Capitals GM Brian MacLellan said it's going to be difficult for teams at or near the cap to round out the bottom portion of their rosters.
 "It's going to be tight," he said. "There's going to be some tough decisions that have to be made.
 "We'll try and do our best to make the right ones."
