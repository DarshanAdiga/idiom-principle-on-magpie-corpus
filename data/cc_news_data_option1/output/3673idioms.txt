On December 2018, CBS announced that season 7 of Elementary are the final one, with a total of 13 episodes, making it the show' shortest period. Season 6 was originally thought to be the last one, as it'd just 13 episodes, but CBS afterwards ordered eight extra episodes and renewed the series to get a shorter and last season. Although season 6 finale could have functioned as a definitive conclusion to the series, the network chose to give the authors a chance to finish the arcs of the personalities properly - and judging from the name of the last episode, "Their Last Bow", it all points in the start getting the ending that it deserves, with a generous dose of references to the source.

Irizarry faces potentially decades behind bars, though no immediate date was set for his sentencing.
 The plea marked a stunning fall from grace for Irizarry, who had won repeated praise from superiors after joining the DEA in Miami in 2009 — even after he showed signs of deception on a polygraph test.
 Before he resigned in 2018, his ostentatious habits and tales of raucous yacht parties with bikini-clad prostitutes had become legendary among agents.
 Beginning around 2011, prosecutors said, Irizarry used the cover of his badge to file false reports and mislead his superiors, all while directing DEA personnel to wire funds reserved for undercover stings to accounts in Spain, the Netherlands and elsewhere — accounts that he controlled or were tied to his wife and his co-conspirators.
 In total, Irizarry and informants under his direction handled at least $3.8 million that should’ve been carefully tracked by the DEA as part of undercover money laundering investigations, prosecutors said.
 The indictment details at least $900,000 paid out from a single criminal account opened by Irizarry and an informant using the name, passport and Social Security number of a third person who was unaware their identity was being stolen.
 Proceeds from the scheme funded a veritable spending spree, including the purchase of a $30,000 Tiffany diamond ring, a BMW, three Land Rovers and a $767,000 home in Cartagena as well as homes in south Florida and Puerto Rico, where Irizarry and his wife had been living. It also funded the purchase in Miami of a 2017 Lamborghini Huracan Spyder on behalf of a family member of one of the co-conspirators.
 To hide his tracks, prosecutors said, Irizarry opened a bank account in someone else’s name and used the victim’s forged signature and Social Security number.
