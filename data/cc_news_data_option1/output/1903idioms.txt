Sono passati ben 28 anni da quando Ed Boon e John Tobias lanciarono sul mercato Mortal Kombat 1, un picchiaduro all’apparenza poco interessante all’interno del quale potevamo selezionare uno tra 7 combattenti che si sfidavano tra loro al fine di poter sconfiggere i boss finali Goro e Shang Tsung. Badate bene, abbiamo volutamente impiegato l’espressione “all’apparenza”: Mortal Kombat 1 infatti, rispetto a titoli similari dell’epoca quali Street Fighters, Fatal Fury o Art of Fighting, permetteva a noi gamers di giustiziare gli avversari, controllati o dall’intelligenza artificiale o da un secondo player, attraverso le divenute famosissime Fatalities. Le mosse più brutali della storia dei videogiochi nel 1992 fecero scalpore e al tempo stesso rivoluzionarono e arricchirono un genere, il picchiaduro, che non sarebbe mai stato più lo stesso. Dopo quasi 30 anni, MK, giunto nel 2019 al capitolo numero 11, continua a furoreggiare quando si tratta o di congelare il nemico e farlo in tanti piccoli pezzettini (Sub Zero) o di infilzarlo grazie a un cappello certamente fuori dall’ordinario (Raiden). Come il buon vino, le Fatalities, corposa categoria di tecniche mortali comprensiva attualmente anche di Brutalities, più invecchiano più continuano a piacere, anche nel 2020!

FOSTER, Rhode Island -- Clothing is normally discouraged at the Dyer Woods Nudist Campgrounds in Foster, but this year will be a little different.


  "Because of our unique situation, there will be people wearing a mask and nothing else," said Bob Difilippo, campground manager.


  Restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus have forced a lot of changes on Rhode Island businesses, including the 200-acre campground.


  Marking the start of the season, Memorial Day weekend is usually big for the campground, but this year will be quiet. At a time when interest in the camp seems to be increasing, Dyer cannot accept any non-member guests. The only campers allowed on the property are its 25 or so regular members, those who have their own trailers and keep them at the facility year-round.


  "The restrictions are very tight right now," Difilippo said.


  On a summer weekend, Dyer will typically draw 100 to 120 visitors each day, people who can enjoy hiking their trails, sunning themselves by the water, playing volleyball or Frisbee golf. The camp has sites to set up tents, park RVs and cabins for rent.


  Difilippo says he's been fielding five or six calls per day from prospective visitors wondering when the campground will open, and whether they can visit. He has to tell them no, for now.


  "We have no income coming in, really, except for those people who've renewed their leases," he said.


  Difilippo listens closely to Gov. Gina Raimondo's regular briefings for information on the regulations and possible changes. She said Wednesday that she's considering a plan where out-of-state tourists could avoid two-week quarantine requirements this summer, if they're tested for the coronavirus when they get to the state.


  That might help the campground, Difilippo says, especially since a lot of their day-trippers visit from Connecticut -- its border is just 3 miles away -- but he also wonders if they'd want to go through the trouble of getting a test just to spend a day hiking or sunbathing.


  The members who do visit the campground will notice some differences. There will be no skinny dipping in the swimming pond. The camp store, clubhouse and sauna will be closed. Gathering for the popular pot-luck dinners isn't permitted.


  Difilippo has been posting notices around the property to remind campers that they must wear masks when they're within 6 feet of others.


  "We're telling our members to carry a mask with them at all times," Difilippo said.


  Carry them where when they don't have any pockets?


  Nude campers are used to carrying towels to put underneath them when they sit down, Difilippo noted. He added that some campers also use backpacks.


  Despite the difficulties, Difilippo says he isn't bitter about the stringent health regulations. He and others at the camp understand they're necessary to keep people healthy. He's hoping that the rules ease up by July.

Too good to be true? Well, this is where I have to bring us back to reality with the price. The only option available on a Polestar Engineered V60 is color, which my tester was finished in Osmium Gray. It would be great to bring back the Polestar Blue color for some pop. As tested, this car stickered out at $68,940. While it seems expensive given the fact that the entry-level T5 starts at around $40k, I’d argue this car is worth the money. Volvo wagons, especially fast versions, hold their value very well and are a sought-after piece years down the road by enthusiasts.

SHREVEPORT, La - Beauty salons can reopen on Friday, but some beauticians said they have some concerns.


  Some beauticians said their requirement to put in writing whether an employee or customer has ever contracted COVID-19. They said it borders an invasion of privacy.


  Terri Pugh, owner of Setting The Standard Barbering and Natural Hair Salon on Jewella Avenue, said it seems a bit unfair to ask these questions of her customers.


  "You wouldn't go asking the client if they had HIV," Pugh said. "You know, if you cut yourself. You just take the necessary precautions."


  Marquita Jackson, owner of Gracious Reflections Natural Hair Care Salon on Mansfield Road, said the 25% guideline is hurting the bottom line.


  "As far as the safety of the client, I'm going to fulfill that. However, I still have living expenses as well as business expenses," Jackson said.


  Both beauticians said the business model for styling and caring for multiple clients at a time will cease for now. But they say ultimately it will determine whether they can remain in business for long term.

Neustart in der 2. Liga: Großer Nachteil für Dynamo Dresden
 Welche konkreten Konsequenzen das haben kann, zeigt sich aktuell bei Dynamo Dresden. Wegen zweier Fälle musste die gesamte Mannschaft für zwei Wochen in häusliche Quarantäne, sodass die ersten beiden Begegnungen und vermutlich auch das dritte Spiel verschoben werden müssen. Doch auch danach bleibt ein Wettbewerbsnachteil für den Zweitligaletzten, schließlich fehlen gegenüber den Konkurrenten mindestens zwei Wochen Mannschaftstraining.
 Den seitdem kursierenden Vorwürfen, die Dresdner würden die Situation nutzen wollen, um einen Saisonabbruch zu provozieren, hat der Verein vehement widersprochen. Denkbar bleibt aber, dass sich die Sachsen für ein Aussetzen der Abstiegsregelung und eine Aufstockung der Liga einsetzen werden. Was wiederum die Gegner auf den Plan bringt, die fürchten, ohne Abstiegsgefahr würden Teams aus der unteren Tabellenregion die Saison ohne größeres Engagement runterspielen und somit für Wettbewerbsverzerrung sorgen.

The migrants are the middlemen between the smugglers and those now paying about £3,000 a head to get a seat on a boat heading to England. Perhaps because of the police activity, no boats turn up while we were there.


  But there is plenty of demand for the smuggler's illegal trade. In our time in Calais, we met migrants from Iran and Afghanistan who had already handed over the money and were heading for the location they had been told to go to.


  No specific date had been given. They were simply told to be ready for the green light. The dangers of crossing the Channel - often with as many as 20 people in an inflatable RIB designed for eight - are no deterrent.


  Nor indeed is the prospect of being caught and sent back. They were prepared to take the risk anyway.


  But such a lucrative operation demands a constant supply of equipment and is fuelling crime in Calais.


  Boats, RIBs and motors have been stolen from the harbour - the smugglers even more brazen during the lockdown with fewer people out.

Ludhiana As many as 17 personnel, including high-ranking police officials, in Ludhiana were sent into isolation after two bodies recovered in crime cases were found positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).While one of the bodies was that of a 15-year-old boy who was allegedly murdered, the other was of an unidentified person, believed to be a migrant in his 40s. According to the additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP) Sachin Gupta, the nodal officer for Covid-19, as many as 17 personnel, including deputy commissioner of police (DCP, crime) Simratpal Singh Dhindsa, ADCP (crime) Harish Dyama, ADCP-III Gurpreet Kaur Purewal, ACP (civil lines) Jatinder Kumar Chopra, ACP (Crime-1) Mandeep Sandhu, Division Number 5 station house officer Richa Rani, six members of the staff of Division No 5 police station, two assistant sub-inspectors of Government Railway Police (GRP), and three members of the forensics division, have been asked to remain in self-isolation.Sources said that these personnel had remained near the body for nearly an hour for carrying out preliminary investigations.FAMILY OF MURDER VICTIM RUSHED TO ISOLATIONSoon after the test results came, the police swung into action and sealed the street in Janak Puri where the murder victim, Karan Kumar, 15, lived. His family members were also rushed to the hospital and health teams started his contact tracing.According to the family, Karan had left home on May 11 on the pretext of visiting the market but had not returned. The family tried to find him but failed to do so. The family members claimed that they had it on learnt Friday only that Karan was murdered and his body was in the mortuary."Before we could come to terms with this tragic loss, the health department officials along with the police visited our house and took us to the hospital," said Rajesh Chaudhary, the teen's father.Karan's body was found in the demolished quarters of railway colony number 5 on Wednesday. As per the prima facie investigation, Karan was assaulted and then strangled to death.The development comes a day after 18 RPF personnel tested positive for Covid-19.Civil surgeon Dr Rajesh Bagga said that the samples of all the persons will be sent for testing as per protocol.Dr Bagga said that beside the two dead, another person from Sahnewal, who was undergoing treatment at Jalandhar, has tested positive for the virus.

The Flyers were the hottest team in the NHL and had won nine straight games before a loss headed into the break. He expected to return for the playoffs after he broke a finger on his right hand blocking a shot March 4 against Washington.


  “I wouldn’t say it’s fully normal as it was before, but it’s getting to the point where I’m not thinking about it as much,” van Riemsdyk said. “I would have been able to play weeks ago, probably. But every extra day I get, I can heal and be more comfortable with kind of getting the feeling and touch back.”

If you're like me, your summer concert plans are up in the air.      Will live shows be canceled? Postponed? Can I get a refund?      These aren't silly questions to ponder. Music-lovers take going to shows seriously. It's one of the best experiences to see your favorite artist perform live.      But safety always should come first. Coronavirus has thrown a wrench into almost everything. Gathering of large groups means the risk is increased. And, with so many unknowns yet about COVID-19, those risks need to be seriously evaluated.      Billboard estimates concert ticket-holders spent almost $3.5 billion for concert tickets and festivals for this summer. That's a huge chunk of change. Most events have been tabled until at least June and some have been scrapped altogether.      I've been following this closely, considering I'm in possession of a few tickets to some amazing shows. Taylor Swift was one of the first artists to call it quits on the tour trail until next year. Swift's "Lover Tour" was expected to be the year's biggest. You can bet she took this news hard, but she also understands it isn't worth the risk of people getting ill or dying. The ability to spread such a virus in mass gatherings is quite high, according to most health officials. Swift opted to offer refunds to ticket-holders.      Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams also dropped their collaborated concert touring events. Like Swift, they took the high road and are refunding ticket costs. This was a much-talked-about tour that several of my friends were interested in attending.      Elton John went about things a little differently. He postponed his sold-out Farewell Tour until 2021, in which he will honor the dates for the show. I think that is an OK option, but that's money some ticket-holders could use right now.      Several other major artists haven't made a decision about touring. I have tickets to see Janet Jackson in Detroit in July, but I may have to make a decision on my own whether to attend. Detroit remains a hot spot for coronavirus.      On the other side of this are venues that have multiple shows booked each week, requiring a lot more work in handling these decisions. Most are operating with limited staffing to accommodate rescheduling of artist events, offering optional shows in replacement of canceled shows and the processing of refunds.      My best advice is to keep checking the ticket venues for possible cancellation postings or rescheduled events. Ticketmaster.com has updated information on a daily basis. You will need to be patient, though. You are not the only person affected by this.      My hope is things will improve and some sort of normalcy will return. What has been considered normal before may not be the same from here on out. However, the music stays the same. It's a healer and it will be here long after COVID-19 is not.   David T.

Morris and wife of 31 years, Jane, have two adult children. Morris was elected to the county board of supervisors in 2016, succeeding the retiring Elaine Armstrong in District 3. Speaking on KMA's "Morning Line" program Friday morning, Morris says he waited until the final week to return nomination papers for reelection, because he wanted to make sure he had enough energy for a second term on the board.


  "It's a job that takes a lot of effort, and takes a lot of energy," said Morris. "As I get into my golden years, I wanted to make that before I put my name on the ballot, that I was willing to commit to four more years if blessed with being elected. Once that decision was made, I'm very excited to be in the race, and hopeful that voters give me one more term. If I am elected, it will be my final term. Eight years is plenty, in my case."

COLUMBUS, Ga. (WTVM) - Columbus Mayor Skip Henderson and city leaders hosted a virtual town hall meeting Thursday, and answered residents’ concerns about COVID-19 in the area. One common question was if the city has seen a decline in cases. According to Mayor Henderson, the city is at 400 cases now. He says this number can be misleading due to increased testing.“They’ve been doing such a a good job at testing that our numbers are naturally going up. Now, we do watch very closely one set of numbers, looking for trends and that’s with regards to the hospitalization rate. And from that perspective we ave been stable since about the 30th of April and have actually decreased," said Mayor Henderson.The possibility of eviction was another hot topic at the meeting. Columbus’ city attorney said the Federal Housing Authority has a moratorium for FHA-insured homes. For those who are not in that category, you can contact Georgia legal services if you are worried about getting put out for non-payment.“The folks there may be able to help people with general housing issues if they’re not under a moratorium under the federal rules," said Clifton Fay.Another major concern was the reopening of certain businesses and government buildings. According to city officials, all government buildings will be open starting Monday, May 18, but citizens should be prepared to practice social distancing inside.Click here to watch the full virtual town hall meeting.Copyright 2020 WTVM.

Una serie capolavoro come Mortal Kombat è ancora oggi un intramontabile successo nonostante i suoi 28 anni di età e la concorrenza spietata delle tante case produttrici di picchiaduro che hanno provato a spodestarla nei cuori degli amanti dei fighting games realizzando opere, dapprima in 2d e successivamente in 3d, belle ma mai all’altezza del marchio di proprietà di Ed Boon e John Tobias. Secondo noi esiste, come sopra accennato, un’ovvia spiegazione dietro a questo diffuso fallimento da parte dei competitors ed è la mossa finale, unica nel suo genere, chiamata Fatality che solo il brand MK può da sempre vantare. Come ricorderete, ogni personaggio da noi impersonato all’udire “Finish Him/Her” aveva la facoltà, fin dai primi anni ‘90, di fare letteralmente a pezzi l’avversario che aveva cercato di superarci nel corso di un duello faccia a faccia che si svolgeva nell’arco di due match da 60 secondi l’uno. E perché ciò fosse possibile, disponevamo solamente di alcuni istanti durante i quali ci improvvisavamo “abilissimi tastieristi” nel momento in cui toccavamo armonicamente (e correttamente) i pulsanti del nostro joypad al fine di realizzare la melodia di requiem eterno selezionata. Come dimenticare ad esempio il primo Kano bidimensionale nell’atto di estrarre dal petto il cuore del suo nemico oppure Scorpion il cui il fuoco infernale abbrustoliva il corpo del contender? Onestamente non è proprio possibile scordare queste e altre mosse che ci hanno accompagnato nel corso di tutta la nostra infanzia/adolescenza a base di consoles e videogames. MK, oltre a deliziarci grazie a esecuzioni brutali ogni volta differenti e al tempo stesso ottimamente azzeccate, sa come sorprenderci grazie alla profonda a curata caratterizzazione dei suoi protagonisti sia storici che nuovi. Come ci ricorda magistralmente pokerstarnews.it, sito abituato a trattare di tematiche quali e-sports ed e-games, un ludico intrattenimento offline e online come può essere Mortal Kombat per non perdere definitivamente lo status di titolo evergreen deve essere sempre in grado di trasformare un semplice racconto in una complessa quanto piacevole storia contraddistinta da infiniti colpi di scena. Ecco dunque un altro punto di forza della serie ideata da Ed Boon e John Tobias che vive certamente delle più stupefacenti mosse finali ma fino a un certo punto.

  If you're like me, your summer concert plans are up in the air.


  Will live shows be canceled? Postponed? Can I get a refund?


  These aren't silly questions to ponder. Music-lovers take going to shows seriously. It's one of the best experiences to see your favorite artist perform live.


  But safety always should come first. Coronavirus has thrown a wrench into almost everything. Gathering of large groups means the risk is increased. And, with so many unknowns yet about COVID-19, those risks need to be seriously evaluated.


  Billboard estimates concert ticket-holders spent almost $3.5 billion for concert tickets and festivals for this summer. That's a huge chunk of change. Most events have been tabled until at least June and some have been scrapped altogether.


  I've been following this closely, considering I'm in possession of a few tickets to some amazing shows. Taylor Swift was one of the first artists to call it quits on the tour trail until next year. Swift's \"Lover Tour\" was expected to be the year's biggest. You can bet she took this news hard, but she also understands it isn't worth the risk of people getting ill or dying. The ability to spread such a virus in mass gatherings is quite high, according to most health officials. Swift opted to offer refunds to ticket-holders.


  Bon Jovi and Bryan Adams also dropped their collaborated concert touring events. Like Swift, they took the high road and are refunding ticket costs. This was a much-talked-about tour that several of my friends were interested in attending.


  Elton John went about things a little differently. He postponed his sold-out Farewell Tour until 2021, in which he will honor the dates for the show. I think that is an OK option, but that's money some ticket-holders could use right now.


  Several other major artists haven't made a decision about touring. I have tickets to see Janet Jackson in Detroit in July, but I may have to make a decision on my own whether to attend. Detroit remains a hot spot for coronavirus.


  On the other side of this are venues that have multiple shows booked each week, requiring a lot more work in handling these decisions. Most are operating with limited staffing to accommodate rescheduling of artist events, offering optional shows in replacement of canceled shows and the processing of refunds.


  My best advice is to keep checking the ticket venues for possible cancellation postings or rescheduled events. Ticketmaster.com has updated information on a daily basis. You will need to be patient, though. You are not the only person affected by this.


  My hope is things will improve and some sort of normalcy will return. What has been considered normal before may not be the same from here on out. However, the music stays the same. It's a healer and it will be here long after COVID-19 is not.   David T. Farr can be reached at farrboy@hotmail.com.

Royal Mail's stock exchange announcement pointedly noted that Mr Williams "is experienced in business transformation and industrial relations".


  That is just as well, for this appears to be an unmanageable business, blighted by industrial relations akin to the chaos that engulfed British industry in the 1970s.


  Mr Back's defenders argue he was given a hospital pass by Moya Greene, his predecessor, who reached a deal with the union on pay, pensions and working hours in return for it signing up to efficiency targets.


  Entrusted with delivering those improvements and with keeping the union onside was Sue Whalley, the former chief executive of post and parcels UK, touted to the union by the outgoing Ms Greene as a manager they could trust.


  Unfortunately, within months of Mr Back taking the job, Ms Whalley - who had been a contender for the top job herself - was shown the door.

  Doubts were also raised about races going ahead at the Northamptonshire track after the government announced that people arriving in the United Kingdom must spend a fortnight in quarantine, although there would be limited exceptions to that rule.


  A revised schedule for a season that has not been able to get under way is still being worked on, but there was positive news coming out of Silverstone on Friday.


  Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle said: "I am delighted to confirm that Silverstone and Formula 1 have reached an agreement in principle to host two races behind closed doors this summer.


  "However, these races will be subject to Government approval, as our priority is the safety of all involved and strict compliance with COVID-19 regulations.


  "I would like to thank all our fans who have been so supportive throughout this and to assure them we are determined to do all we can to help Formula 1 put on a show this summer."


  July 26 and August 2 could be the dates for back-to-back races at Silverstone after the season has finally got under way with two rounds in Austria, also yet to be confirmed.


  It is also hoped that a deal for the Belgian Grand Prix to go ahead without spectators on August 30 will be struck after Spa-Francorchamps was given government approval.

Public transport is so fundamental to living in the city that to ask people to go back to work but avoid using it is farcical.
 In London, according to statistic published by CBRE, 53 per cent of people get to work using public transport, compared to 17 per cent across England.
 Surely then it's fine to ask people in the suburbs and countryside to avoid public transport - most people will drive to work anyway. In London this just isn't possible, so people should be told to just work from home as best as they can, in the same way they have been doing for weeks.
 Add to this the population density of the capital. There are 4,542 people per square km in Greater London - it's the most populous city in the EU - compared to 716 next door in Surrey.
 Telling people they can go for a walk, let alone sit in a park, in London is a recipe for distaster. It's just not possible to keep two metres from everyone all the time, no matter how hard you try.
 Another issue is that now people have been told they can drive places to go for a walk, those Londoners who do have cars will be going out into the countryside to enjoy some actual green space - possibly taking coronavirus with them - and infecting locals who don't have enough hospitals to cater for them.
 Just to top it all off, Londoners will be the most keen to get out and about.

You can easily drive around town using electric power alone. It’s managed in a clever, yet not perfect way. When driving in “Hybrid” or “Pure” (eco) mode, there is a dead spot in the accelerator pedal mapping that allows you to bring the car to the maximum electric power before kicking the gas engine on. This works well, but occasionally I’d notice that I pushed my foot too hard down and accidentally kicked on the engine. I have to note that there is no perceptible way to notice the engine has kicked on if you are listening to music even at a low volume. The only indication you have switched to dinosaur juice is a little water droplet on the gauge cluster. It is impressive how seamless this powertrain works together.

I leave all bent laminations and curved pieces clamped (or pressed, as in a vacuum bag) for at least 12 hours. To know for sure that the adhesive has cured, the manufacturer recommends pouring a small amount in a plastic bag and laying it flat near the glue-up. (Don’t use adhesive poured into a cup, because a thick layer won’t be an accurate indicator.) When the adhesive in the bag can be removed in one piece and is the consistency of firm rubber, a non-stressed glue-up can be removed from the clamps. Wait until the adhesive is completely hard and brittle before unclamping a “stressed” glue-up.

Balance sheet. Yes, we paid $538 million in cash dividends, but we still have $122 million of cash and no debt, no long-term debt. Is that good luck? Is it just an accident? I don't think so. I don't think so. So we've not taken any shortcuts. We don't cut corners. We built something from nothing at Park twice now. We made money the old-fashioned way. This may sound cliché, but if you live it every day, you feel that it's palpable. So nobody ever gave us anything. We never asked -- or we don't want anything from anybody, but there's another reason that's not just good luck and that's called discipline.

FOSTER, Rhode Island -- Clothing is normally discouraged at the Dyer Woods Nudist Campgrounds in Foster, but this year will be a little different.
 "Because of our unique situation, there will be people wearing a mask and nothing else," said Bob Difilippo, campground manager.
 Restrictions to stop the spread of the coronavirus have forced a lot of changes on Rhode Island businesses, including the 200-acre campground.
 Marking the start of the season, Memorial Day weekend is usually big for the campground, but this year will be quiet. At a time when interest in the camp seems to be increasing, Dyer cannot accept any non-member guests. The only campers allowed on the property are its 25 or so regular members, those who have their own trailers and keep them at the facility year-round.
 "The restrictions are very tight right now," Difilippo said.
 On a summer weekend, Dyer will typically draw 100 to 120 visitors each day, people who can enjoy hiking their trails, sunning themselves by the water, playing volleyball or Frisbee golf. The camp has sites to set up tents, park RVs and cabins for rent.
 Difilippo says he's been fielding five or six calls per day from prospective visitors wondering when the campground will open, and whether they can visit. He has to tell them no, for now.
 "We have no income coming in, really, except for those people who've renewed their leases," he said.
 Difilippo listens closely to Gov. Gina Raimondo's regular briefings for information on the regulations and possible changes. She said Wednesday that she's considering a plan where out-of-state tourists could avoid two-week quarantine requirements this summer, if they're tested for the coronavirus when they get to the state.
 That might help the campground, Difilippo says, especially since a lot of their day-trippers visit from Connecticut -- its border is just 3 miles away -- but he also wonders if they'd want to go through the trouble of getting a test just to spend a day hiking or sunbathing.
 The members who do visit the campground will notice some differences. There will be no skinny dipping in the swimming pond. The camp store, clubhouse and sauna will be closed. Gathering for the popular pot-luck dinners isn't permitted.
 Difilippo has been posting notices around the property to remind campers that they must wear masks when they're within 6 feet of others.
 "We're telling our members to carry a mask with them at all times," Difilippo said.
 Carry them where when they don't have any pockets?
 Nude campers are used to carrying towels to put underneath them when they sit down, Difilippo noted. He added that some campers also use backpacks.
 Despite the difficulties, Difilippo says he isn't bitter about the stringent health regulations. He and others at the camp understand they're necessary to keep people healthy. He's hoping that the rules ease up by July.

And well why are we doing that? The reason we're doing that is we're -- it's actually a good thing because – because of our reduced demands, we don't have that intense pressure to get the factory up and running right away. So it gives us the ability to kind of hold back on some of these things so we can make decisions three, six, nine months down the road as to what would be ideal or optimal for what we need rather than being have that much pressure and then just we've got to get this done. A year later it may not have been what we really would want when we look back on it. But we didn't have that luxury.
