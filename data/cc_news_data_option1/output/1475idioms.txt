 PCB will also be signing a new TV rights deal this year.
 The absence of bilateral series against India, because of soured political relations between the neighbours, would hurt but Mani said there was not much PCB could do about it.
 "Definitely it's a loss but we are not even thinking about it," Mani said.

Real Madrid and Barcelona sit three points clear at the top of La Liga following routine victories against Las Palmas and Getafe respectively on Saturday.
 Following Atletico Madrid's draw with Deportivo La Coruna on Friday, Madrid and Barca took their chance to apply pressure at the top with the latter easing to a 3-1 success at the Santiago Bernabeu.
 Isco and Cristiano Ronaldo gave the hosts a two-goal cushion 15 minutes in before Hernan reduced the arrears. Jese Rodriguez completed the scoring before half-time with Barca joining them on 24 points later in the day.
 Following defeats on the road to Sevilla and Celta Vigo, Barca were seeking to avoid losing a third away game on the spin in the league for the first time since 2002.
 And Sergi Roberto proved crucial as the midfielder supplied the assists for Luis Suarez and Neymar in Madrid - ensuring Luis Enrique's men continue to pick up points in Lionel Messi's injury-enforced absence.
 Fellow high-flyers Villarreal briefly went fourth after they beat Sevilla prior to Celta Vigo's dramatic 3-2 victory over Real Sociedad.
 Sevilla were in fine form ahead of their trip to El Madrigal but goals from Mario and Cedric Bakambu put the hosts in control prior to Fernando Llorente's consolation 14 minutes from time.
 That put Villarreal in the top four ahead of Celta's trip to the Anoeta, which saw the visitors twice fall behind before fighting back to earn a victory.
 Iago Aspas twice cancelled out Imanol Agirretxe before Pablo Hernandez scored a minute from time to send Celta back third.
 In the local derby at the Mestalla, Valencia ran out comfortable 3-0 winners against rock-bottom Levante courtesy of goals from Paco Alcacer, Sofiane Feghouli and Zakaria Bakkali.

Despite the return address on the Christmas cards saying “Secret Santa” and the address on the Valentine’s Day cards reading “Happy (heart symbol),” investigators looked into who had been fired from the company at the time that each of the victims were part of the welding department chain-of-command. Investigators matched the handwriting on the cards to Burns’s writing.
 According to court documents, the company revealed that Burns had been fired in April 2019 and that each of the victims were his coworkers or superiors. Several people reported that Burns didn’t like women working in the welding department or women in authority positions and would use the swear word that is written in the cards to refer to his women coworkers.
 Court documents do not name the business or the victims. Five victims wrote to the court to ask that Burns be denied bail and not be released from jail fearing for their safety and the safety of their families.

VIRUS OUTBREAK-NORTH CAROLINANorth Carolina deaths pass 100; protesters seek order's endRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Deaths in North Carolina of those with COVID-19 have exceeded 100, but the increase in the number of positive cases may be slowing. The Department of Health and Human Services reported 108 related deaths statewide as of Tuesday and more than 5,000 positive cases. Department Secretary Mandy Cohen mourned the deaths at a media briefing but says social-distancing directives are helping blunt the intensity of the virus. They include Gov. Roy Cooper's stay-at-home order. Around 100 people who want Cooper to ease or lift the stay-at-home order held a midday rally on Tuesday in downtown Raleigh before being dispersed by police.AP-NC- GROUNDED SHIPNorth Carolina shipwreck has become a hazardous attractionNAGS HEAD, N.C.

But the National Park Service is warning people to stay away from the shipwreck for their own safety. The Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday that the ship, named Ocean Pursuit, has been grounded at Cape Hatteras National Seashore since March 1. Its crew was rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The Park Service says the vessel is unstable and sits close enough to the ocean that it could be dragged out to sea. All hazardous materials and fuels have been removed, but it remains unclear when the ship’s owner will retrieve the vessel.APARTMENT SHOOTING-REWARDNorth Carolina police department offers reward in slayingASHEVILLE, N.C.

It is about half an hour south of Winston-Salem and northeast of Charlotte along Interstate 85.

For one fervent devotee of Notre Dame, the barricades, which replaced a smaller barrier, symbolize her loss, and the virus spreading across France and the world.
 “Notre Dame is confined. I couldn’t throw a bouquet of flowers over to her,” said Cecile Deleville, who had tossed one over the lower fencing in December. “It’s as though they took that away, too.”
 The 67-year-old retiree dared to take her first look at the cathedral a day after the fire, along with reporters from The Associated Press. She said at the time that she felt like an orphan.
 Now, she fears she won’t see Notre Dame reborn in her lifetime. Deleville worries that the reconstruction will fall by the wayside as France tries to rebuild its economy once the virus has been vanquished.
 Donations large and small are helping to pay for the restoration, with 400 million euros ($437 million) from three sources alone: the Total oil company and French tycoons Francois Pinault and Bernard Arnault of the luxury giant LVMH. Millions more have been pledged, but it was the modest donations, mainly from people in France and the United States, that covered the initial costs.
 Those in charge of returning Notre Dame to its original splendor are still at work, despite being locked down.
 The cathedral “has been gravely injured, undeniably so,” Jean-Luis Georgelin, a retired general appointed by Macron to head the restoration project, said in an interview with the Catholic publication Le Pelerin.
 But it has resisted thermal shocks from the fire, water from hoses that drenched it for days, the summer heat and high winds, he said, adding that sensors installed to read any movement of the structure have picked up nothing notable.
 A timeline for the reconstruction may need to be redrawn to account for the virus lockdown. What also is unclear is what the new spire will look like. Will it be a copy of architect Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc’s 19th century creation in lead that soared 96 meters (315 feet) high, or be a contemporary version?
 With Notre Dame still in agony, Deleville, the believer who lost her church, cannot muster a vision of the future.
 “It makes my heart cry,” she said. “I return but she isn’t there.”

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — In a pre-dawn raid in food-starved Zimbabwe, police enforcing a coronavirus lockdown confiscated and destroyed 3 tons of fresh fruit and vegetables by setting fire to it. Wielding batons, they scattered a group of rural farmers who had traveled overnight, breaking restrictions on movement to bring the precious produce to one of the country’s busiest markets.
 The food burned as the farmers went home empty-handed, a stupefying moment for a country and a continent where food is in critically short supply.
 It was an extreme example of how lockdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus may be choking Africa's already-vulnerable food supply.
 Lockdowns in at least 33 of Africa’s 54 countries have blocked farmers from getting food to markets and threatened deliveries of food assistance to rural populations. Many informal markets where millions buy their food are shut.
 About one in every five people in Africa, nearly 250 million, already didn’t have enough food before the virus outbreak, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. A quarter of the population in sub-Saharan Africa is undernourished.
 “This is double any other region," said Sean Granville-Ross, director for Africa at the aid agency Mercy Corps. "With lockdowns, border closures and the ability to access food curtailed, the impact of COVID-19 on Africa could be like nothing we have seen before.”

While Vada Pav may resemble a burger, the taste and preparation of it are very different from the latter. This dish which is an Indian street food has potato-based patty and a bun. This patty is a blend of mashed potatoes, spices, chilies, and chopped onions. They are dipped in a chickpea flour batter before deep frying.

It would be another 10 days, during which time his condition worsened, before the musician was brought back in for bloodwork and additional testing. “It took basically testing for everything else,” said Benson, “to acquire a COVID-19 test.” The good news is that the musician posted a video update on Facebook on April 7, saying that he was feeling a lot better and sending his best wishes to everyone watching: “I hope that y’all will be well, help those around you that you can, and we’ll be back playing some music as soon as this blows over.”

Kabwasa: Poet addresses generational trauma in the black community

Adam Lallana believes the reaction to new Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has been "a bit over the top" following his appointment as successor to Brendan Rodgers.
 The former Borussia Dortmund head coach signed a three-year deal at Anfield earlier this month and his arrival was greeted with much fanfare from the Liverpool faithful and the British media.
 Klopp's opening two matches in charge have been underwhelming affairs, however, with a 0-0 Premier League draw with Tottenham followed by a disappointing 1-1 stalemate with 10-man Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday.
 Lallana has warned that Klopp will not transform the team overnight and has asked for patience from the supporters.
 "It was never going to just change overnight," he told the Liverpool Echo.
 "Maybe the reaction to him coming in was a bit over the top but he's a great manager who has had great success.
 "He's asking people to do different things to what they were used to so it will take a bit of time. I think in his first two games you have seen glimpses and moments of the style he wants to play.
 "Jurgen has made it clear that he demands 100 per cent. He wants us to win the ball back as soon as it's given away.
 "It's not going to happen overnight, but I'm very confident we're going to succeed under him.
 "The fans here demand success here and we want to give them that."
 Lallana was disappointed with Liverpool's third draw in as many games in the Europa League group stage but he was thrilled with the return to the squad of Roberto Firmino and Christian Benteke, with the latter hitting the post after coming on as a substitute.
 "We're disappointed we didn't take the three points," he said. "We started well, but conceded a sloppy goal and we all need to switch on a bit more.
 "It was great to have Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino back fit and hopefully Daniel Sturridge won't be too far away.
 "Looking at the squad, there are definitely goals there."
 Liverpool's next game is against Lallana's old club Southampton on Sunday.

China unicorns' valuations slide as virus-fearing investors seek early exits
 By Julie Zhu and Yingzhi Yang
 ReutersApril 15, 2020, 8:09 a.m. UTC
 By Julie Zhu and Yingzhi Yang
 HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Valuations of Chinese unicorns have fallen below levels reached in the firms' most-recent fundraising rounds, secondary market offerings by existing investors show, highlighting the strain on backers amid the coronavirus outbreak and volatile markets.
 Potential acquirers of privately held shares have been more actively approached about buying into the billion-dollar startups since China started reporting high numbers of virus cases in February, said two investors offered such shares.

  __
 Face recognition technology developer SenseTime, backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, and DJI, the world's largest commercial drone maker, have seen valuations fall 10% since funding rounds in June 2019 and April 2018 to $6.84 billion and $14.5 billion based on secondary market offerings, the people said.
 Stakes in online education provider VIPKID, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd, and bike-share firm HelloBike, backed by Ant Financial [ANTFIN.UL], have also been offered at reduced valuations. VIPKID's $3.95 billion represents a 15% discount while HelloBike's $3.2 billion is 20% lower, said the people.
 HelloBike, DJI and SenseTime declined to comment on the secondary market valuations. VIPKID did not respond to a request for comment.
 The change in direction for China's once-buoyant private market comes as investors fear that takeovers and initial public offerings (IPO) - common ways of realising profit from early investment - will be harder to achieve, or at best take longer partially due to the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.
 The coronavirus outbreak has greatly interrupted economic activity, prompting financial and corporate investors to exit investments early to ease liquidity pressure.
 "Two years ago, we were joking 'cash is trash', but now cash is definitely king," said Robert Qiu, chief executive of Unicorn Selected, a Chinese platform focusing on private equity's secondary trading market.
 Story continues
 "Some investors see no immediate way to exit through stock markets, but they need cash at hand so they're turning to sell shares in secondary markets."
 Secondary trades are usually conducted through platforms such as Unicorn Selected, or marketed by well-connected bankers and corporate lawyers.
 Venture capital investors exited 25 Chinese deals valued at $13.36 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus just nine worth $5.34 billion in the same period last year, showed data from PitchBook.
 Venture funding in Chinese firms also dropped 33% to $8.39 billion over the same period.
   
 IPO BLOW
 While not all valuations are falling, investors are frank about difficulties they face, particularly in industries such as catering, retail and tourism that have been hardest hit by restrictions on movement aimed at stopping the virus spreading.
 "Our portfolio firms face significant challenges. Many are seeing revenues drop, which will have a massive impact on their cash flow," said David Tang, a partner of venture capitalist NGP Capital.
 Investor confidence in Chinese unicorns has also been weakened by Nasdaq- listed Luckin Coffee Inc, a self-declared challenger to Starbucks in China, which earlier this month said some of its 2019 sales were fabricated.
 Luckin's shares, which floated in May, fell more than 80% on the news. Trading of the shares has been halted since April 7.
 "The Luckin scandal will likely put a temporary freeze on U.S. IPOs by Chinese companies. Global investors will become far more cautious about investing in such companies," said one senior China-focused investment banker at a Wall Street bank.
 Shareholders in Chinese unicorns are also worried that soggy performance of many Chinese listings in the United States could also dent their portfolio firms' IPO prospects.
 While the Nasdaq Composite has gained 15.2% over the past two years, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed on the exchange, has dropped by the same amount.
 "Some existing investors now would rather exit earlier than wait any longer for portfolio firms to go public," said Zhou Liang, head of UniSharesClub, a private shares trading platform of investment bank China Renaissance. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."

Voters will go to 14,330 polling booths across the nation Wednesday to elect 300 lawmakers who will serve a four-year term beginning May 30.      The election is essentially seen as a midterm judgment of President Moon Jae- in’s five-year tenure, which expires in 2022.      However, the spread of the novel coronavirus has shifted focus to the assessment of how his government has handled the health crisis from what it has done over the past three years.      The fallout from the outbreak and competitive proposals by rival political parties to provide citizens with rescue funds have engulfed other issues in the campaign.      The pendulum appears to have swung toward the liberal ruling Democratic Party as the Moon government’s response to the outbreak has gained a positive assessment from the public.      Moon’s approval rating rose to a 17-month high of 54.4 percent last week on the back of the relatively successful containment of the virus, according to a poll released Monday.      The ruling party hopes Moon’s high approval rating will translate into support for its candidates as more voters cast ballots to back the government’s quarantine efforts and measures to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19.      It is aiming to win a parliamentary majority. The ruling party currently holds 120 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.      Some figures close to Moon have voiced expectations that the Democratic Party and other liberal and progressive parties aligned with it will secure up to 180 seats combined.      The conservative main opposition United Future Party has been ineffective in taking issue with what it calls the government’s misplaced policies. It says they have dampened economic vitality, failed to denuclearize North Korea and weakened the South Korea-US alliance.      Its leader Hwang Kyo-ahn, who is running in a constituency in Seoul, has proposed to give 500,000 won ($410) to all citizens in response to the government’s plan to pay up to 1 million won in relief money to households in the bottom 70 percent income bracket.      His proposal, which prompted the ruling party to call for providing the planned rescue funds to all households, has deflected the focus of his party’s campaign away from the ill-conceived policies pushed by the government.      The opposition party has criticized the government for indulging in “self- praise” with regard to the containment of the virus, which it says should be attributed to the devotion of medical staff and ordinary citizens’ efforts to maintain social distancing.      This argument may make some sense, but has fallen short of neutralizing the ruling party’s campaign strategy to ride on the public’s positive assessment of the way the government has handled the virus outbreak.      A chief campaigner for the United Future Party said earlier this week that given voter sentiment, the conservative party might get fewer than 100 seats. This would give the ruling party a supermajority and allow it to push through any legislation, including a constitutional revision.      The aim of his remarks seems to be to persuade more undecided voters to cast ballots for opposition candidates.      Undecided voters, who are estimated to account for about 20 percent of the electorate, are expected to hold the key to the outcome.      Considering that voter turnout in two days of early voting last week reached a record high of 26.69 percent, or 11.7 million voters, the final voting rate is likely to exceed that seen in previous parliamentary elections, when it typically hovered below 60 percent.      A higher voter turnout could reflect the electorate’s will more accurately.      Going to the polls, voters need to recall what the government has done over the past three years and think about whether it would be good for the nation to stay on this same course down the road.      It is noteworthy that the ruling party has shied away from trumpeting the performance of the Moon government, particularly in the economic arena, throughout the campaign. Still, it has made no pledge to try to redress the administration’s ill-conceived policies, including the income-led growth drive and the plan to phase out nuclear power.      An election victory, particularly an overwhelming one, might lead the Moon administration to cling even more tightly to its misplaced policies. In addition, it would be less inclined to implement regulatory and labor reforms and other measures needed to ensure that the nation is prepared for the time after the coronavirus crisis comes to an end.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will assess Daniel Sturridge's fitness before deciding whether to risk the striker against Southampton on Sunday.
 Klopp is preparing for his first Liverpool league game on home soil and could be able to call upon his leading marksman for the first time.
 Sturridge has been beset by injuries since scoring 22 goals in 29 Premier League appearances during the 2013-14 season and a knee knock sustained in training ruled the 26-year-old out of Klopp's debut in the Liverpool dugout at Tottenham last weekend.
 He also missed Thursday's 1-1 Europa League draw against Rubin Kazan but the England international could come into contention to face Southampton – most likely as a substitute – if he impresses in training.
 "[His situation] is not much better, we have to see day by day," Klopp told a news conference. "If he can train tomorrow [Saturday] completely normal then he's an option.
 "Maybe not as a starter but he's an option and I have to wait."
 Divock Origi has started both matches under Klopp as a lone striker but his Belgium colleague Christian Benteke and Roberto Firmino returned from injury as substitutes against Rubin - bolstering the options available to the manager, who is open to starting with two recognised forwards in order to give his shot-shy side an attacking edge.
 "If all the strikers are fit we have four and we have to think about how we take that quality in our game," Klopp added
 "I don't know if we play with two on Sunday, but it's an option. Christian and Roberto had two training sessions with the team, usually it’s too early but they did well.
 "Christian was unlucky [to hit] the post, Roberto became better within the game. [They are] two important options for Sunday."

Again, the key is to use technology to be more productive and remain ahead of the curve . How are others doing it ?
