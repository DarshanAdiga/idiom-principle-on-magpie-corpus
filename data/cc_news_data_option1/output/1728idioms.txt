"In terms of popularity, the Jordan Bulls are in another stratosphere. The fandom around them was just crazy. I mean, they packed 62,000 people in the Georgia Dome to watch Michael's last game. There would be 2,000 people lined up outside of the hotel just to watch Michael walk from the hotel to the bus.

It really depends on if you like purple or if you like red."

Because the decision came late in the virus fight, some of those released may be infected and capable of spreading disease.

"It's been overwhelming, to tell you the truth. Nobody ever thought it would be this big of a reception from an American audience, and just how big the response has been. We knew when we shot it and the way Michael ended that '98 season, with that steal and that shot, that we had the holy grail of sports documentaries in the can. But no one could predict that it would take 20 years, multiple interviews and multiple cuts, and that it would end up being what it is.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, Gott's Roadside was rapidly expanding. The company had two projects in the works near San Francisco's Chase Center. The first was set to be a spacious new restaurant at the plaza outside of the arena.
