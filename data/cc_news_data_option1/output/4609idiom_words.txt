  Opelousas Police Chief Martin McLendon is quarantining after testing positive for COVID-19.


  McLendon posted on the department's Facebook page on Wednesday that he had "taken all the steps necessary to protect those that I work with and those closest to me."


  "Having said that, I want to take a moment and say publicly how proud I am of our commanding officers and our officers in the field. They have not missed a beat," he wrote. "Throughout all of these trying times, and with my current condition, they have been hard at work bravely fighting to see that the streets of our city are safe."


  It is unclear if any other officers or staff are having to quarantine because of the chief's positive test result.


  City Hall had to close in July and members of the mayor's staff were tested for the coronavirus after Opelousas Mayor Julius Alsandor tested positive.
