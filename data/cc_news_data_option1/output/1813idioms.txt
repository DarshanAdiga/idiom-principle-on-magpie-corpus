Robert Downey Jr has camped in the role of Iron Man for many years (since 2008). Between the movies of the saga and those of the Avengers, the character of Tony Stark was one of the most legendary and popular of the Marvel universe. However (beware of SPOILER), in "Avengers : Endgame", released on the 24th of April last, Iron Man is dead… All the fans are left in shock and this has made a lot of noise on the Net. Moreover, the MCU would like to find ways to revive Iron Man, while keeping the story of his death and his sacrifice. Will they get there ?

An animated series entitled "Marvel What If" is in preparation, and should see the light of day in the summer of 2020. But then, Iron Man will it be this time ? Robert Downey Jr will be there in this project ? Actor Jeff Goldblum has responded to these questions….
