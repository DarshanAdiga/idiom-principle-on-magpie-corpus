The Colts added three more points to attain the even-rarer score of 12-3. Then, with less than two minutes to go before the half, the Vikings completely imploded. Cousins rolled right and chucked the ball to his left, deep into double coverage. A gimme interception, and a 40 yard return to boot. We happily watched as the Colts scored yet another field goal to reach a 15-3 lead. Cousins tossed a Hail Mary interception to end the first half, adding a cherry on top.

Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu is hopeful the club can arrange a special friendly for outgoing striker Luis Suarez when fans can return to football stadiums in Spain.
 Atletico Madrid confirmed the signing of Suarez on Wednesday night, subject to the passing of a medical, with the Uruguayan poised to pen a two-year deal at Los Rojiblancos.
 Despite hitting 21 goals in an injury-hit season last time out, Suarez’s physical levels have dropped in recent seasons since his prime and his future has come under increasing scrutiny in recent times.
 Suarez has netted 197 goals across 283 appearances for Barcelona since joining the club from Liverpool in the summer of 2014, becoming the club’s third all- time leading goal scorer.
 “I would like you to have a tribute match so that you can say goodbye to all the fans, when the pandemic allows us to return to the stadiums,” Bartomeu said, as per Marca.
 “I want to highlight your contribution by your character, fight and winning spirit. On behalf of all the Catalans I thank you after six years. They have been years of much struggle, I hope that the personal and professional future is as good as it has been up to now. I want you to be happy on and off the pitch. Barça is your home forever.
 “You have given us so much that today we are very grateful.”
 It has been reported that many Barcelona officials were angered by the manner of Suarez’s exit, with some even threatening to hand in their resignations with Suarez said to have been frustrated by the Blaugrana previously planning to block his exit.

The State government has again sanctioned food kits to 1,000 transgender persons.
 The State had become the first to provide food kits to transgender persons in the first phase of lockdown in March. With the spike in disease, transgender persons have been facing a difficult time.
 The government has now sanctioned food kits to the tune of ₹700 each to 1,000 transgender persons who have ID cards, those who have completed screening for the cards, and those who have applied for it.
 However, this number forms only a small percentage of the total number of transgender persons in the State. A socio-economic survey in 2014-15 had estimated the number of transgenders in the State at 25,000. They have been further pushed to the margins of society by the pandemic.
 Apoorva, a transgender person, used to work as a cook at the Social Justice Department’s shelter for transwomen at Karakkamandapam here but after it closed down, had no income. Consequently, Apoorva had to move back home with her parents. She is also worried about how to meet the hospital expenses of her parents.
 Ruby, who too had worked at the same shelter home, had taken up fish business. But after a friend died, all the savings were wiped out. She has not been working since. The rent on her house has been adjusted against the advance, but with no money in hand, she has no option but to move out the next month.
 Community members say the food kits provided by the government or the assistance of ₹1,500 provided by the National Institute of Social Defence are only a drop in the ocean. Some have got a breather after shifting to the shelter homes run by the community under a government project.
 The increase in funds sanctioned for sex reassignment surgery from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh and self-employment loans announced by the KSWDC are welcome steps, but financial assistance is necessary to tide over the difficult times, they say.
 Their hopes are now pinned on a proposal for government assistance of ₹1,000 for 800 transgender persons.

Furious but unsurprised. That's how most of Black America, including myself, is feeling following the press conference by the office of Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Furious because accountability for Breonna Taylor shouldn't be up for debate considering she was slain in her own home and bed. In every way she's the "perfect victim" for widespread, nonpartisan support. And yet so was Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice and Aiyana Stanley-Jones and the countless others, which is why we are unsurprised. We have danced this dance of disappointment before. We have been deferred justice countless times before. An America that affirms our lives doesn't matter is what sparked this global movement to begin with. "Black Lives Matter" is what we chanted, and still America found new ways to remind us that it literally _begs_ to differ.
 To those wondering aloud if this measly indictment is better than no indictments at all: it isn't. The calls for arrests were flawed to begin with. What would justice look like for a young woman awoken at home by thieves in the night who were empowered to rob her of her life with impunity? I can assure you that this isn't it. But the thing is, the indictments of all three of the officers involved in Breonna's death would not have been justice either. We have made the mistake of being excited by charges when transgressors could just be acquitted in a Hail Mary pass to save the day for white supremacy. This isn't a metaphor. The various players within our larger criminal "justice" system are portrayed to be in a structure of checks and balances when they are in fact teammates. Under public pressure, police may be arrested but the judges and district attorneys and attorneys generals will always ensure that power is rarely, if ever, ceded. Furious yet unsurprised.

Mullens easily found his tight end seven times for 210 yards, including an 85-yard scoring play. "He was open every play, man. It was crazy," Mullens said after the game. Still, Nick had a near- costly end-of-game blunder when he mistakenly took a kneel-down snap too soon. That allowed Denver one last shot at a comeback win -- fortunately, the bumbling Broncos fumbled the ball out of bounds on the game's final play.

Porterville College (PC) has announced the appointment of Joseph “JL” Buchanan as the new Pirates Head Baseball Coach.
 Buchanan, who most recently coached at Taft College, will lead the men’s baseball team at PC for the first time during our next in-person season. He’s already begun teaching classes virtually in our kinesiology program.
 Athletic Director Gerred Link feels that PC has found the right individual to lead the team into the future. “We are excited to welcome JL to the Pirate family. He brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to our campus, having served in various roles over the past 8 years in the Central Valley Conference. We believe he is ready for the challenge of being a head coach and are excited for this opportunity. He will be a great addition to our campus, student and the Porterville communities.” said Link.
 For the past four years, Buchanan served as Head Assistant Coach of the Taft College Baseball team. Prior to Taft College, J.L. was Head Assistant Coach at West Hills College, Coalinga. For the past eight years he has served as the Head Coach of the Mile High Collegiate Baseball League (MHCBL) five-time Champion Colorado Cyclones.
 His familiarity with communities like Porterville and the operation of sports programs within them, makes Buchanan a perfect fit for the Pirate’s ball program.
 “I am extremely excited about the opportunity to be the next Head Baseball Coach at Porterville College. I am very familiar with the Central Valley Conference and style of play that it takes to succeed within.”
 Due to COVID-19 restrictions, no practices are permitted this semester. This presents some unique challenges in working with the team. Buchanan feels he is up to the challenge, and he has high hopes for what the future of the program holds for local athletes.
 “Our main focus right away will be changing the former culture of past programs. We plan on recruiting local talent more than ever during this transition. We want to give Tulare/Kern County a promising program that will provide our area’s student-athletes with a true opportunity to come and develop,” stated Buchanan.
 He continues, “We strongly feel that the city of Porterville deserves a respectable collegiate baseball team to stand behind and support. I truly am beyond grateful to be chosen for this opportunity and will dedicate my all to helping Porterville College baseball achieve new standards. Go Pirates!”
 In closing, Link adds, “I am very excited for the future of the Porterville College baseball program. JL has hit the ground running and we are all eager to get back on the field. Hopefully, in January, athletics will be able to return to campus, and JL will be able to put his coaching philosophies into practice.”

Before the peaceful march, the group of hundreds packed the corner of Eighth Avenue and B Street, where a portrait of Taylor’s face adorned a large poster.
 Three Black women addressed the crowd.
 One, who did not give her name, said the decision earlier Wednesday in Kentucky amounted to a “slap on the wrist.”
 She said she “loves being Black,” but that it “comes with a lot of obstacles.”
 “As a Black woman, I don’t feel protected,” she said before leading a chant of “Black lives matter, Black women matter, Black men matter, Black lives matter.”
 Another protester said “justice has not been served” in Taylor’s death and that the Black Lives Matter movement was a marathon that was just getting started.
 Earlier in the afternoon, a separate group of about three dozen demonstrators gathered outside a San Diego courthouse.
 On social media, the protest’s organizers wrote that the country’s “justice system failed to serve Breonna Taylor, her family and the Black community.” The organizers urged protesters to “show up and let them know that police impunity will not be tolerated.”
 Outside the San Diego Superior Court building on Union Street, where sheriff’s deputies had strung up caution tape a few minutes before the demonstration began, the protesters used colorful chalk to write, “No justice, no peace.”
 Inside the courthouse, deputies stood near the glass doors while the group of about 35 demonstrators chanted “Black lives matter, murder is the minimum.”
 While no officers will face charges for the 26-year-old Taylor’s death, the grand jury indicted former Louisville Metro Police Department Detective Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment, a low-level felony, for firing shots that went through Taylor’s apartment and into an adjoining unit.
 That decision prompted one protester outside the San Diego court to write in chalk, “Why do her neighbors’ peace matter more than Breonna’s life?”
 A sign at the march read, “They murdered a woman in her sleep & the only charge was for the bullets that missed.”

When estrogenation makes one lay an egg too big for the anal passage and there is a tear, the others peck the poor bird to death at the sight of blood. So, the farmer must periodically cut short their beaks. This is also traumatic for them and fills them up with adrenaline. These are the chickens whose meat we relish, not realising that we eat sick animals and that, since We Are What We Eat, we, too, are bound to be sick. It is for this reason as well that l eat only guinea fowl egg when it is in season. Even then, I am mindful of the fact that the yolk is a load of cholesterol and therefore, take dietary measures to emulsify it in the bloodstream. The egg comes with lecithin to do just that. But cooking or frying destroys lecithin, leaving the cholesterol mass to cause havoc not only in the intestine but in the blood vessels, the heart and the brain as well. One may solve this problem with lecithin, vitamin E, orange peel powder and dietary supplements designed for this purpose.

One of the GOP’s tried-and-true vote-suppression techniques is deploying squads of partisan muscle into non-white, immigrant and other Democratic- leaning neighborhoods and precincts. These “poll watchers” single out voters they view as “suspicious” and accuse them of trying to vote illegally. They aren’t subtle. Sometimes packing guns, badges, cameras, arm bands, etc., to pose as official ballot police, they literally pull people out of line to loudly demand proof of eligibility. It’s ugly and frighteningly autocratic ... and yet legal in many states.
 And it’s going to be bigger than ever this November because its one legal restriction has been lifted. Back in 1982, Republican thuggishness had gotten so out of hand that a federal judge imposed a consent decree to stop some of the crudest intimidation methods. But, with the Trump campaign’s support, that ban was withdrawn in 2018, and this year’s presidential election will be the first in four decades to allow no-holds-barred voter intimidation.
 The national GOP has been recruiting and training up to 50,000 partisans to confront voters in 15 key states! Adding to the mayhem, True the Vote, a manic fringe group of Trumpeteers, is signing up a freelance militia that includes off-duty police officers and veterans to enforce “ballot security” in communities of color. The group leader explained the scheme at a February meeting of Republican operatives: “You get some Seals in those polls and they’re going to say, ‘No, no ... this is how we’re going to play this show.”

None of this comes out of the blue. The left is disenchanted with our country, and especially its governing institutions, which it believes are shot through with racism and deeply undemocratic. Democrats have gone from assuming a few years ago that they have a permanent majority to assuming that they can’t possibly win under such a rigged system.
 They no longer want to live under a government that checks majoritarian passions, recognizes the importance of states in our federal system and features a Supreme Court that is supposed to render independent judgments based on the law and the Constitution. All of this, once a matter of basic civics, is now for suckers.
 Before its new fashion, court-packing used to be notorious, the ill-considered move that FDR couldn’t see through even at the height of his power.
 For good reason. To add a bunch of new seats to the Supreme Court explicitly so a Democratic president could fill them would radically diminish the Court’s standing. It would invite Republicans to counter with their own bout of court- packing when they again return to power. The Court would become merely a partisan plaything and essentially an adjunct to the legislative branch — all that would stay the same about the institution would be the black robes.
