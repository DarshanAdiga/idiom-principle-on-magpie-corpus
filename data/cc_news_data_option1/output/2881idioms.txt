"A lot of it I would say comes down to having a new style of play coming in with a new coaching staff, learning that it really can at times be difficult. But, we have to keep sticking to the principles, do it together have each other's backs and with that, the goals will come. Trusting the process. That's a big thing as athletes," said Eddy. "So often it's what can I do to get to this goal or this goal and at the end of the day, what can I do today to get one degree better? That's what our team is choosing to do, although it's hard because sometimes a forward you're like, you have to score if you're not scoring you're not doing your job. Instead you take a deep breath and say what's the team need you to do. They need you to press, they need you to hold, make those runs. It's coming, trust the process."

NEWPORT -- Discover Newport has informed the city that it is no longer interested in leasing the ground floor of the Gateway Visitors Center, where visitors information, tickets and directions have been provided for the past 32 years.


  Evan Smith, Discover Newport's president and CEO, said the organization is in negotiations with the city to continue leasing the second floor for the sales and marketing team, as well as the third floor conference room. However, Discover Newport is willing to move all its operations to a smaller office space if the city is interested in finding a better use for the whole building, he said.


  "We believe the time has come to re-purpose this important piece of real estate," Smith said. "Discover Newport would like to work with the city toward developing an exciting new future for this facility."


  The smaller space at the back of the ground floor will continue to serve as the Newport terminal for Rhode Island Public Transportation Authority bus operations, which includes a waiting area and restrooms. RIPTA has a long-term lease with the city for that use of the property.


  The changes were accelerated by the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown, but were inevitable in the long run, Smith said. Discover Newport had been considering ways to become more efficient and focused before the pandemic hit, he said.


  "The Gateway Center was designed and built in the mid-1980s before the evolution of computers and cell phones," Smith said in a document outlining why the changes are necessary.


  The visitors and convention bureau for Newport County, which Discover Newport still is, moved into the building on America's Cup Avenue on June 18, 1988. Several years ago, the organization became the visitors bureau for Bristol County as well.


  "New technology has rapidly changed how people obtain travel-related information, including lodging, attractions shopping, dining and events," Smith wrote in the document. "Websites and mobile apps have replaced most of the information functions of traditional 'brick and mortar' visitors centers."


  Back in April, Smith announced Discover Newport had to lay off 18 of the 22 people on its staff. Besides Smith, the staff members that remained were Kathryn Farrington, vice president of marketing; Tim Walsh, vice president of sales; and Alyson Adkins, vice president of finance.


  Smith said the organization was able to bring back since then Julie Grant, who handles the Discover Newport website, an important piece of its operations.


  Gone are the experienced digital marketing, sales logistics, social media and content managers; the destination experts and other coordinators who worked to bring so many conferences, events and weddings to the city and promoted the city nationally and internationally to bolster the local tourism industry.


  More than 90% of Discover Newport's funding comes from the state lodging tax paid by hotels, motels, inns and other lodging properties. Past annual budgets have been more than $3.7 million.


  Besides losing a significant part of its room taxes share, Discover Newport also lost funding from other sources, such as selling advertising on the website and from Gateway Center activities.


  For the current fiscal year that began on July 1, the anticipated revenue for the organization is now $1.5 million, meaning $2 million in expenses had to be eliminated.


  As those revenue expectations stabilize in the coming months, Smith is optimistic that he can have a total staff of 10 or 11 people by the end of this calendar year, which would be the maximum for the fiscal year that ends on June 30, 2021.

The cancellation will have an impact on the political arena. Knives are out for Kono, a reputed “maverick” with aspirations for the premiership. The Carnegie Endowment’s James Schoff suggests that some in the ruling party “maybe want to feel like they're setting a trap for him to take the fall later when this doesn't really work out because there are no other easy options.” Indeed, Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai complained that, aside from Abe, no party officials were consulted on the decision, and Kono was obliged to apologize.

SNA (Seattle) -- On June 15, Defense Minister Taro Kono announced a suspension of the deployment of the Aegis Ashore missile interception system—a suspension that ten days later became a cancellation.

Like most things, COVID-19 has impacted the Aug. 11 primary election.


  The biggest change you will notice is fewer voters. Many eligible voters have chosen to submit their ballot by absentee voting. This easy to use process has been allowed in Minnesota for decades. It’s a safe and easy alternative to voting in person and can be used by any eligible voter.


  Should more voters than expected appear in person to cast a ballot, election judges will be stationed at the doorway to limit the number of persons in each polling place and ensure adequate social distancing is maintained through the day.


  The next thing you might notice is all election judges will be sporting masks and many of them will also be sitting behind sneeze guards with one judge to a table. This helps keep election staff, and those who choose to vote in person, as safe as possible.


  No voter will be turned away for lack of a mask, but if you choose to wear one, organizers say it will be appreciated. Note that, depending on state or local laws regarding mask usage, this may change.


  Hand sanitizer will be prevalent in the polling place for use by voters and election judges who are being provided with their own personal use bottles. Each voter will receive a sanitized pen, along with their ballot and an “I Voted” sticker. At the conclusion of the voting process, the pens will be returned and sanitized once again.


  Secrecy sleeves, the manila folders used to keep ballots private as a voter moves around in the polling place, will be used once only. The tables divided into voting stations will have every other space blocked off to ensure adequate distance between voters as they cast their ballots. Hard surfaces will be wiped down on a regular basis throughout the day with sanitizing wipes.


  And finally, the software of the DS200 ballot tabulator has been upgraded to be extra user friendly which will help eliminate the need for an election judge to watch over the equipment. However, if you still do need help, judges will be ready to provide it.


  If you have questions about voting, contact the city administrator’s office at 934-0663 or by email at barbaral@saintpetermn.gov. And if you are a Ward I voter, remember that your polling place has been changed to Johnson Hall at the Fairgrounds (400 West Union Street).

  Summer usually means busy times for the Ava/Cassville/Willow Springs Ranger District, and 2020 is no exception. District employees continue their work in landscape restoration, providing recreation opportunities for the public and wildland firefighting and prevention.


  Fire staff are supporting the western fire season, currently focused in the Southwest. When at home on the ACW Ranger District, they continue to train and patrol. They also provide assistance to any other Forest work that needs to be accomplished, such as mowing, maintenance and laying out cedar units for restoration work within the Joint Chiefs project.


  Summer recreation is in full swing with all recreation areas on the ACW Ranger District re-opened. The pavilions at Shell Knob and Noblett are taking reservations again through recreation.gov. Users will still need to practice social distancing. The restrooms at Big Bay Day Use and Pine View Tower trailhead remain closed. The Big Bay boat ramp repair contract, in the Cassville area, has been awarded.


  The District also welcomed two new employees -- Olivia Woolsey and Emily Ficker.


  Woolsey is in the Resource Assistant Program and will be a customer service representative at the Cassville office. She will be assisting with the recreation program as well. Woolsey is a recent graduate from University of Missouri in Columbia with a degree in Forest Resource Management.


  Ficker joins the team as the Support Service Specialist. Ficker previously worked for the National Park Service in Utah. Ficker said she looks forward to continuing her public service in Missouri.


  The ACW office in Ava, being cognizant of health and safety guidance, continues to assist visitors by telephone when possible, but will also help in-person visitors by meeting them outdoors. Access into the buildings is limited, and a mask must be worn.


  Residents who need assistance, please call the ACW District Office at 417-683-4428. The office is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

BARNSTABLE -- A Barnstable Superior Court judge heard a motion Tuesday to dismiss the case against the man accused of shooting and killing Yarmouth police Sgt. Sean Gannon.


  Thomas Latanowich has been indicted on multiple charges, including first- degree murder, for allegedly shooting Gannon in 2018 while the officer was part of a team serving an arrest warrant at a house on Blueberry Lane in Marstons Mills.


  Judge Kathe Tuttman also heard testimony from several police officers who spoke with Latanowich at the time of the incident for a separate motion to keep his statements out of evidence.


  The judge, who recently took over the case, made no decisions on the motions, and another hearing is scheduled for Aug. 19.


  Gannon's parents and wife were among those in attendance. The session was one of the first in-person hearings in the Barnstable court since courts statewide were closed to the public because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone in the courtroom was required to wear a mask, unless they were testifying or talking to a witness. Attorneys did not approach the witnesses and instead projected evidence onto a TV screen.


  Defense attorney Joseph Krowski argued that during the grand jury proceedings the Cape and Islands District Attorney's Office repeatedly sought testimony on issues outside of the case, including Latanowich's nickname "Tommy Guns" and his prior criminal cases, in order to "poison" the jury.


  Krowski moved to dismiss the indictments based on what he said was inappropriate bad character evidence.


  Much of the prosecution's evidence focused on prior acts and character evidence that had nothing to do with Gannon's death on April 12, 2018, Krowski said.


  Latanowich has a long criminal record, with 111 prior charges in this state.


  Assistant District Attorney Michael Trudeau countered that there was plenty of other evidence to support probable cause and the evidence in dispute would not have made a difference in the grand jury proceedings.


  Latanowich's attorney also argued that his client should not be facing a first-degree murder charge


  "Even with all this prejudicial information, in my mind, I don't see a pathway to first-degree murder," Krowski said.


  To rise to the level of first-degree murder, a killing must be "committed with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought, or with extreme atrocity or cruelty" according to state law, and Krowski argued there was no evidence that Latanowich planned to shoot someone when a warrant was served at the house.


  Trudeau said premeditation could be formed in a matter of seconds.


  "That's exactly what happened here," he said, noting that Latanowich aimed the gun and pulled the trigger when officers found him behind insulation in the attic.


  Krowski also has been trying to suppress statements that Latanowich made to police and civilian witnesses through phone calls and text messages after the shooting. The attorney said Latanowich was in a compromised emotional state and there was a heavy police presence, making his statements involuntary.


  Trudeau said none of the calls were coerced and many were initiated by Latanowich, including four 911 calls to the Barnstable police and admissions to his daughter's mother that he shot Gannon.


  Three Barnstable police and two state police officers testified, along with one civilian. Another civilian was due to testify but could not make it to court because of a medical condition.


  Barnstable police dispatcher Kurt Lariviere, Officer Nolan O'Melia and Lt. John Murphy told the court of their conversations with Latanowich on the day of the shooting. Latanowich allegedly made four 911 calls while he was in the house, saying he wanted to talk to an officer.


  Lariviere and O'Melia were working in dispatch and talked to Latanowich in his brief calls, which were played in court. Latanowich gave them his number and eventually ended up talking to Murphy.


  The two exchanged several calls, totaling about 25 minutes of conversation over the course of about two hours, as Murphy tried to gain Latanowich's trust and have him come out of the house.


  Latanowich did not trust the police and feared that if he came out, his life would be in jeopardy, Murphy said. Latanowich also asked to see his daughter and the daughter's mother, Krystal Bearse.


  The officers said Latanowich talked largely in a flat tone.


  "It was a normal conversation," Murphy said.


  Murphy said he felt pressure to resolve the incident before anyone else got hurt.


  He testified that he told Latanowich he could not allow Latanowich's daughter to come to the scene. In one of several phone calls, Murphy tried to assure Latanowich that he would be able to see Bearse if he came out peacefully.


  At the time, Latanowich was also in contact with Bearse.


  Murphy said he ended up taking out his St. Michael's medal, putting it in Bearse's hand and praying he'd have the strength, courage and wits to get Latanowich to surrender. St. Michael the Archangel is the patron saint of police officers.


  Soon afterward, Latanowich did come out and Murphy allowed Bearse and Latanowich to see each other in the back of a cruiser, with a safety shield between them, he testified.


  Murphy advised Latanowich of his rights and drove him back to the station. The pair did not talk about law enforcement, but mostly of Latanowich's daughter, Murphy said.


  In his interactions with Latanowich, Latanowich did not get emotional, except when he talked of his daughter, Murphy said.


  Krowski argued that even though Latanowich had an even demeanor, that did not mean he was not under duress, as Murphy also kept an even keel despite feeling pressure.


  The two state police officers testified to cellphone data and conversations from what is alleged to be Latanowich's phone.


  One of the other people Latanowich apparently talked to during the attempts to get him to surrender was Priscilla Coelho, a friend he occasionally texted and Snapchatted with.


  Coelho testified that she heard from Latanowich after the shooting and he said he was getting locked up.


  Krowski argued that Coelho, who did not have Latanowich's number saved in her phone, could not know that it was actually Latanowich sending the messages.


  After the testimony, Tuttman went over new filings from Krowski and potential future hearing dates.


  Krowski already has asked for extensive records from Cape police departments about the case and now is asking for Yarmouth and Barnstable police personnel records to find out how many officers were responding to the call, as well as records for Gannon's K-9 partner, Nero, who also was shot but recovered, and other officers who may have had past interactions with Latanowich.


  The court is scheduled to hear from the final witness on the motion to suppress Aug. 19, as well as a motion to suppress evidence found in bags that were with Latanowich in the attic.


  Krowski is supposed to file a motion for a change of venue by Oct. 1. A hearing on that motion is expected to be held Nov. 12.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH/CNN) - Investigators are searching for the remains of a 10-year-old boy who they say was murdered by his father.Court documents reveal Nakota Kelly warned his mother that his dad, Anthony Dibiah, was going to kill him because he had made his dad angry.Dibiah’s westside Indianapolis apartment has been sealed by the Marion County Coroner’s office. According to court papers, the 37-year-old man suffocated Nakota with a bag inside of this apartment. He then took the boy into the bathroom to make sure he was dead.Shortly afterwards, Dibiah called a family friend and said what he had done.“And because No. 1, it’s summer, but also because people haven’t been in school, I think it is that much more important that the community is vigilant if they see things and are aware of things that they make law enforcement aware of what is going on so we can protect individuals who often times cannot reach out for themselves,” Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears said.According to court papers, the scene was nothing short of horrendous when officers entered the apartment. There was blood all over the bathroom. Dibiah was gone, and there was no sign of the 10-year-old boy.“The scene here and some of the images that are going to be depicted are just one of those things that will stay with you forever,” Mears said.Earlier, Dibiah had asked a friend for some luggage.On Sunday morning, according to the probable cause, he is seen on surveillance video loading items into his vehicle, and he threw one bag into a community dumpster.He sent a text message to a person identified as HK that said, “Sometimes, I hear voices. My son is in heaven.”Late Sunday evening, Dibiah called someone in Texas and told them, “I killed my son.”Dibiah was picked up by a Missouri State Trooper and taken into custody. When he gets back to Indiana, he could face life in prison.“This type (of) case will be considered either life without parole or death penalty. One of the statutory aggravators you can use is anytime a person less 14 years of age. That certainly kicks in that conservation,” Mears said.Police are still searching for Nakota’s remains.Copyright 2020 WISH via CNN. All rights reserved.

I said that once some man had been calling me a lot wanting to give me one, but that I'd never called him back or something, and then the kid looked up and said, 'Yeah, that was me. I'm Steve Jobs.' And he looked so young, like a college guy. And he told me that he would still send me one now. And then he gave me a lesson on drawing with it. It only comes in black and white now, but they'll make it soon in color…I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who helped invent it."

ST. LOUIS -- Things have been remarkably ordinary as the St. Louis Cardinals conduct spring training 2.0.


   


  At least, as ordinary as they can be during such extraordinary times.


   


  Their core players have continued to test negative for COVID-19 ahead of this week's opener of the abbreviated season. They haven't had any injuries pop up that could dramatically alter their plans for the starting rotation or lineup. And the few questions they did have during the spring, such as how they would cast their deep platoon of outfielders and how they would stack their bullpen, have been largely answered.


   


  "We feel like we're in a place where the work's been very solid and very efficient," manager Mike Shildt said. "The credit goes to the players. They came in spot-on -- their focus, their attention to detail, their ability to execute. Everything we have done to this point, camp's been really, really clean."


   


  The Cardinals believe they had a roster capable of winning the NL Central when spring training was halted because of the pandemic. That optimism didn't wane while players were doing at-home workouts in the hopes of some kind of season.


   


  The biggest reason for that? Their starting rotation is among the best in the majors. Right-handers Jake Flaherty, Dakota Hudson and Miles Mikolas have shown the ability to dominate for long stretches, and ageless wonder Adam Wainwright provides a veteran presence in the clubhouse for an otherwise young group.


   


  "As these games get even closer and these intrasquad games get stretched out even longer you're going to see a little more edge. Guys are going to get a little more gritty," Mikolas said. "I think it's going to be fun."


   


  New look


   


  The biggest question in the offseason was how the Cardinals would replace slugging outfielder Marcell Ozuna, and that question only became compounded with news that National League teams also would use a designated hitter for every game this season. But there are options, including a glut of talented young outfielders who need at-bats for their development.


   


  The other newcomer to watch is left-hander Kwang-Hyun Kim. The veteran left- hander was dominant in the Korean League last season and his versatility as a starter or out of the bullpen will be helpful during this unique season.


   


  Rookies to watch


   


  The Cardinals are paying Dexter Fowler handsomely to play right field, and Harrison Bader, Tyler O'Neill, Tommy Edman and Lane Thomas give them five players capable of manning the three spots. That means Dylan Carlson, their clear-cut No. 1 prospect, faces an uphill climb to see playing time this season.


   


  Carlson was on his way when spring training was halted, though. The switch- hitter was hitting .313 in 39 plate appearances, and he was among 10 minor leaguers with 20 homers and 20-plus steals last season.


   


  Bullpen without Hicks


   


  The Cardinals hoped to have Jordan Hicks back from Tommy John surgery midway through the season, but he chose to opt out last week and continue to rehab. Still, the club returns a stacked cast of relievers headlined by Carlos Martinez, Andrew Miller, Giovanny Gallegos and John Gant, who somehow managed to go 11-1 out of the bullpen a year ago.


   


  Scheduling situation


   


  St. Louis opens its 60-game season against the Pirates on July 24 at Busch Stadium. Its second homestand brings a three-game set against the rival Cubs, after which the Cardinals head to a cornfield in Iowa to face the White Sox at the Field of Dreams in Dyersville. The season concludes with a series against the cross-state rival Royals and four games against the Brewers that could decide the division.


   


  "I'm really comfortable and confident that this team is going to compete regardless of circumstance and regardless of the opponent," Shildt said. "They're all such alphas."

  Mail balloting is also anonymous and atomized. Instead of meeting at the polling place on election day in a community effort to reaffirm our public commitment to democratic participation, voters are isolated, connected only by the glue on the back of a postage stamp.


  Thanks to the Flu Manchu, this is shaping up to be an election–by–mail and bureaucrats aren’t prepared. “In Kentucky, nearly 1 million voters requested mail ballots, vastly more than the roughly 50,000 voters who usually vote absentee.
