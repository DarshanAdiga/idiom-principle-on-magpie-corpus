"Thankfully the payroll protection loan has been available and we were able to get that and that's kept me above water because without it I wouldn't have had any revenue," said Terrell.
 Another challenge that daycare centers in West Texas are facing is the inability to hire anyone. This is because employees are required to be fingerprinted by the state through one company, and that company has all of their facilities shut down in West Texas.
 Even before the green light was given on Monday, Odessa daycares have been taking care of essential workers' children but with fewer kids after a request from the Mayor.
 On the other hand, Midland daycares were not limited to the amount of essential workers' children they could take in. They could take up as many kids as they were allowed to legally have in their facility.
 Now with the governor's new order, they have to reduce the number of children they can care for.
 Gary Lane, the owner of Envirokids in Midland, is trying to ease parents into the changes this week instead of throwing all the new rules at them at once.
 Lane knows that these changes will result in the center losing 30-40% of their revenue.
 "Now when you look at how many child care possible spaces were available and then the state cuts that down by 30-40 percent per child care center, what are these families supposed to do?" questioned Lane.
 Lane also told NewsWest 9 that in the last two days he's had to turn away more than 15 children that needed child care, agreeing with Terrell that child care is already scarce and could get worse for our area.

They had received the same form letter from the Kushner Companies’ property management arm, Westminster Management, that other tenants in the complexes had gotten. It stated that rent was still due on the 5th of every month, but that there would be no late fees for the time being. The company, which declined to comment (or to respond to a list of tenant complaints cited in this article), would also no longer charge an extra fee for paying rent online.

“(The) government’s extraordinary argument that it is lawful for a witness — a government employee, no less — to lie to the FBI about contacts with a high- ranking representative of a hostile foreign power simply cannot hold water,” the former federal prosecutors and DOJ alumni asserted. “Indeed, the argument is so transparently untenable that it would seemingly make sense only as pretext for some other, unstated rationale for seeking dismissal of this case.”

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A former judge of elections in Philadelphia has admitted accepting cash bribes to tamper with the results of the city's primary elections from 2014-2016, federal prosecutors announced Thursday. Domenick J. Demuro, 73, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deprive voters of their civil rights and violating the Travel Act, U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain said. DeMuro faces up to 15 years in prison when he's sentenced June 30. DeMuro admitted that a political consultant — whose name was not revealed by prosecutors — paid him bribes to add fraudulent votes for certain Democratic candidates running for judge positions. McSwain did not name the candidates or say if any of them won their elections. The consultant took fees from the candidates and used some of that money to pay Election Board officials, including Demuro, McSwain said.

Now, though, that whole apparatus of intimidation has been disabled by the temporary ban on evictions. Without that final stage of the process for forcing payment, the rest of the apparatus has fallen away. There are, for the time being, no late fees, no “court costs,” no summonses on doors. And even without that threat, many tenants are managing to make their rent, for now, thanks partly to enhanced unemployment benefits and the cash payments in the CARES Act.

He and his wife, who had lived there for two years, had also been unable to pay on time because he hadn’t been working after having a couple of heart attacks and her hours working as a file clerk had just been cut way back as a result of the pandemic. He had also gotten the letters promising leniency from the management office and was also wary of how much stock to put in them, given management’s record. “I’ve been a renter for 20 years, and I’ve never seen anything like that,” he said. “I’ve never seen someone get put out so fast as around here. Thirty days, and you’re gone.” With evictions on hold for the time being, though, he was more worried about an immediate concern: bedbugs. They had been getting worse of late, he said.

But now the landscape has changed. Parry has now confirmed that there would be only two boxes on the ballot paper. The teams can either vote to stop the season now and follow the EFL’s framework for how the season will be ended, or they can vote to play on behind closed doors like nothing ever happened. There is no option for: “I’m not sure.”
 His statement has given those indecisive club owners time to sit back and reflect on the decision they will have to make, now knowing that it will take only a 51% margin to decide the future of the season.
 So which way will those six sides swing?
 Doncaster Rovers, five points off the play-off places, say that they will abide by the wishes of the EFL, but that if the season is cancelled then null and void would be the fairest approach - so the Sky Blues cannot count on their vote.
 Next up is Blackpool, who have been pretty compliant during this League One row. They are 14 points away from the play-offs and have admitted that they do not wish to put up a fight - that vote could be ours.

Clem Miller, a congressman from California’s North Coast known as Spendin’ Clem for his ability to bring home pork-barrel funding, was a shoo-in for re- election to a third term in 1962.
 However, a month before the election, a small plane carrying Miller to a campaign appearance crashed in the hills east of Eureka, killing him, the pilot and the pilot’s young son.
 It was too late to remove Miller’s name from the ballot, so voters still had to either vote posthumously for Miller, or for Republican Don Clausen, a little-known Del Norte County supervisor.
 The national Republican Party quickly poured money into the sprawling district, hoping that they could snatch away a congressional seat, but voters opted for the dead congressman over Clausen.

“We don’t have this situation in Texas, but in California, people go and pick up these ballots and bring them in,” he said. “Say I’m for candidate ‘A,’ and I go pick up ballots and 90% of the signs in the neighborhood are for candidate ‘B.” Do you think those ballots will make it back to the registration office?”
 Other trouble spots for fraud include having someone else fill out the ballot for a voter and the lack of oversight on who, specifically, is disabled, Dux said. On the application for a mail-in ballot, the reasons given are 65 years or older, citing a disability, an expected absence from the county at the time of the election or confinement in jail.
 “The issue with that is the election office receives a request and the person says, ‘I’m disabled,’ and the elections office has to accept it,” Dux said. “There’s really no check on whether they are truly disabled or not.”
 In some cases, Dux said he could see a caretaker filling out a ballot incorrectly for an elderly person and having them sign it and send it in.
 “The second half is what is the integrity of the voting?” he said. “ If there is no regulation or control to make sure the ballot is filled out by that resident, potentially someone could fill out that form for them and have them sign it.”
 The fear of increased fraud if mail-in-ballots increased has been pushed by top Republicans, including President Donald Trump.
 “It is quite laughable given ... that there is no evidence of increased fraud as a result of mail-in voting,” O’Connor said. “Republicans want to make it difficult for working people, minorities and college students to vote, so there is a pattern nationwide of reducing the number of polling places in minority neighborhoods, introducing unnecessary and expensive identification requirements, ‘disenfranchisement by typo,’ purging of voter rolls of those who didn’t vote in past elections, reduced early voting periods and other restrictions the sole purpose of which is to make voting more difficult for those with time constraints.”
 O’Connor’s view is in agreement with Biery, the federal district judge, who said the state had provided “little to no evidence” of widespread voter fraud in other states that use mail-in voting, according to a Texas Tribune article.
 “The Court finds the Grim Reaper’s scepter of pandemic disease and death is far more serious than an unsupported fear of voter fraud,” Biery said. “Indeed, if vote by mail fraud is real, logic dictates that all voting should be in person.”
 The U.S. Appeals Court is still reviewing the case. It issued what is known as an administrative stay, meaning Biery’s ruling is on hold until the court reaches a decision.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A bitterly divided Senate panel voted along party lines Thursday to advance President Donald Trump’s choice to head the Voice of America and other U.S. government-funded international broadcasters that have been the subject of harsh criticism from the White House. After rejecting eight Democratic requests to postpone the move, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent Michael Pack’s nomination to the full Senate on a 12-10 vote. Pack is Trump’s choice to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees VOA and its sister outlets like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Cuba-oriented Radio and Television Marti. Democrats oppose the nomination of Pack, a former associate of Trump political adviser Steve Bannon, in part because of questions about his past business dealings. Recent criticism of VOA from Trump and the White House has intensified their concerns about his nomination. Trump has pushed for Pack’s confirmation while launching unprecedented attacks on the Voice of America, the venerable broadcaster created during World War II to air independent news and promote American values to the world, for its coverage of China’s response to the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats fear that Pack, a conservative filmmaker and former educator, could turn the organization into a Trump propaganda machine funded with more than $200 million a year in taxpayer money. Trump has mused about his desire to control a media outlet. Pack has dismissed concerns he would allow that to happen, but the recent furor has reignited those concerns. The top Democrat on the committee. New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, and other Democrats said the vote should be delayed because Pack has not yet answered questions about discrepancies in tax returns related to a non-profit organization he runs.

"Sarei ipocrita se non dicessi che fin dall'inizio ho seguito queste vicende. Le attività professionali mie e del dottor Sirignano si sono incrociate in Antimafia per quasi 2 anni, per questo avevo pensato di astenermi e di non partecipare al voto. Forse sarebbe stato più comodo astenermi e lavarmi le mani ma sono un consigliere del Csm e su una questione così importante e di interesse generale non posso astenermi", ha detto Di MAtteo. "Il dott. Sirignano parlando della DNA, cioè dell'ufficio che ha compiti importantissimi di coordinamento e di impulso rispetto a tutte le attività antimafia d'Italia, invece di respingere al mittente, ha avallato - ha proseguito Di Matteo - le pretese di Palamara di portare nel cuore dell'Antimafia interessi correntizi, piuttosto che il merito e la capacità". Sirignano, secondo Di Matteo, "anche nell'audizione di ieri davanti al Plenum, ha affermato che anche per questioni così importanti come le nomine e gli assetti della DNA 'se non hai l'appoggio della tua corrente non hai dove andare' e ha ribadito 'avevamo come dominus Palamara'". "Stiamo parlando dell'assunzione di questo criterio, a criterio condiviso per regolare le attività di contrasto alla mafia. E questo per me è molto grave", ha proseguito Di Matteo. "Dagli atti emerge che Sirignano non si limitava a subire le scelte di Palamara, ma lo rassicurava affermando in più occasioni che delle richieste di Palamara ne avrebbe parlato con il Procuratore Nazionale o con il politico Ferri. Cioè le correnti, per il dott. Sirignano, dovevano entrare nella determinazione del lavoro della Procura antimafia. 'Ne parliamo con Federico e con Cosimo', erano le sue risposte a Palamara. Questo risulta dalle intercettazioni", ha concluso Di Matteo.
