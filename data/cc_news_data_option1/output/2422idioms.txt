Be sure not to waste the opportunity that comes with a crisis: that's usually sound advice. And with that in mind, the advice is mounting up for how the economy can be "Built Back Better".
 In recent weeks, I've been looking at some of the more radical plans, to turn the economy over to wellbeing rather than pursuit of ever more gross domestic product.
 With interest from mainstream economists, and the embrace of the Scottish government, it's an idea with the wind in its sails.
 From the Left, the Common Weal group of Scottish policy thinkers, has put together their agenda for change, with a view to influencing next year's Holyrood election.
 ## Conflicting directions
 For BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, I've been looking at ways in which the public sector can learn from the crisis, and continue the rapid pace of reform it achieved in recent weeks, notably in the health service, because it had to.

"We're all going to take 20 minutes and go for a nice walk down the road and through the forest. Then everybody would kind of break off and do their thing: my son would go fishing, my other boy would go for an ATV ride and my daughter's been working full-time up there, but then we'd come together at night and have a family movie and rotate through who chooses the movie.

La normalizzazione tra i Paesi del Golfo ed Israele è a rischio e si indebolisce via via che si avvicina il primo luglio, quando il Premier israeliano Benjamin Netanyau ha annunciato di voler procedere all'annessione di parte della Cisgiordania. E l'ambasciatore degli Emirati Arabi negli Stati Uniti, Yousef Al Otaiba, in una intervista rilasciata al quotidiano emiratino The National, ha spiegato perché si sia rivolto direttamente agli israeliani, con un articolo senza precedenti, pubblicato in lingua ebraica su uno dei principali giornali del Paese. Al Otaiba, stretto consigliere del principe ereditario di Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, ha sottolineato, in un appello diretto a tutti gli israeliani perché facciano pressione sul Governo, come l'annessione annullerebbe definitivamente le aspirazioni israeliane a migliorare i legami di sicurezza, economici e culturali con il mondo arabo. Negli ultimi anni la normalizzazione con Israele qui è stata evidente, anche se i rapporti non sono ufficiali. A partire dalla costruzione di una sinagoga, ad Abu Dhabi, alla partecipazione di Israele ad Expo 2020 (il padiglione non avrà né muri né confini, un invito a migliorare il futuro insieme), fino all'apertura a Dubai di un servizio di ristorazione kasher per la comunità ebraica che, almeno prima del Covid-19, era in aumento. Alle dichiarazioni dell'Ambasciatore sono seguite quelle, analoghe, di alti funzionari della Giordania, dell'Egitto e dell'Arabia Saudita. L'annessione rappresenta "una pericolosa escalation che minaccia le possibilità di riprendere il processo di pace e che mina la stabilità di tutta la regione" ha detto il ministro degli Esteri saudita, Faisal bin Farhan. E se da una parte c'è chi sostiene come la mossa di Al Otaiba sia un grande passo, poiché smentisce uno degli argomenti principali di chi è a favore dell'annessione, e cioè che la questione palestinese abbia perso significato nella regione, l'Autorità palestinese ha invece sottolineato come i Paesi del Golfo si siano allontanati da tempo dal sostegno storico per la loro causa. E ha rifiutato gli aiuti che per la seconda volta in tre settimane, gli Emirati hanno inviato in Israele: l’atterraggio degli aerei Etihad da Abu Dhabi a Tel Aviv, primi voli diretti nella storia, con a bordo forniture mediche per la lotta al Covid-19, poiché non coordinati con la Palestina sono una copertura, ha dichiarato l'Autorità palestinese, e la prova della normalizzazione delle relazioni tra i due Paesi.

Our nation’s immigration policy is evil, capricious, punitive, dehumanizing, and profoundly racist. Today’s decision by the Supreme Court to block the White House from scrapping DACA represents a victory. It protects, for the time being, one important program designed to humanize rather than criminalize immigration in our country. Would that we elect leaders who will affirm the worth, dignity, and common humanity of us all. (Facebook, June 18)

To perform the kyphoplasty, we use a thin surgical needle with a balloon inside it. The instrument is inserted through the skin and back muscles and into the bone. We then inflate the balloon, which comes out the end of the needle and creates a space in the vertebra as it inflates. This portion of the procedure usually helps the bone regain its normal shape. Next, we inject the filler mixture through the needle and into the balloon. This procedure does not require stitches and usually takes less than an hour.
