This year — because of the pandemic — there will be no official service to remember those who were killed. Typically, there are services held in Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, and at Humber Bay Park in Toronto.
 Khandelwal, 52, who’s married with three children, will go alone to Humber Bay Park on Tuesday to remember his sisters.
 His children “will never get to meet their aunts. It’s very difficult,” said Khandelwal, with the Air India Victims’ Families Association.
 “The families hold services every year in order to not only remember our loved ones lost, but also to remind Canadians that we must remain vigilant against the threat and harms of terrorism.”
 June 23 has also been designated by the Canadian government as the National Day of Remembrance to all Victims of Terrorism.
 “We take a moment to reflect on others who have also been affected by the ills of terrorism,” Khandelwal said.
 There is an online memorial site.
 “The people responsible for this have never been held accountable. There have been lots of failures. I will never forget,” Khandelwal said.
 “I was only 17 at the time and will never get over it.”
