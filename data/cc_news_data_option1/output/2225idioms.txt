A group of more than two dozen organizations, including cable operators, advocacy groups and unions have joined forces to slam the Comcast/NBCU merger and call for tough conditions.
 In a letter to President Barack Obama and members of Congress being sent Thursday (Jan. 7), the groups say they have "grave concerns" that the merger will have a "devastating effect" on the marketplace and give the merged company "unprecedented control" over new media outlets. The letter, which comes just short of outright opposition to the deal, levels numerous criticisms before ending with the request that the government "take a hard look at this merger and take the necessary measures to prevent harm to both consumers and competition." Given the divergence of the group's members, that closing allows room for interpretation-outright opposition for some-or conditions so onerous that they kill the deal or, at baseline, tough conditions for others.
 Comcast suggested the groups criticisms were a parade of horribles without substance. "Viewed objectively, the GE/Comcast NBCU transaction is pro- consumer and strongly in the public interest, and we look forward to making that case to Congress, the Justice Department, and the FCC," said Comcast spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice. "There is absolutely no evidence that this proposed transaction would produce any of the adverse effects these groups claim the deal would cause. In fact, existing law already prohibits any discrimination by Comcast against other providers regarding programming we own and would preclude Comcast from "prioritizing" NBCU channels. Further, the emerging online video market is extraordinarily competitive, with sites like YouTube, Netflix, iTunes and dozens of others already offering video from a wide range of content providers, large and small."
 The letter hits most of the talking points-less choice, reduced competition, higher consumer costs-of many of the members' past criticisms of the deal. That group includes Free Press, Public Knowledge, Consumers Union, and Media Access Project. Earlier in the week they took aim at the online industry initiative TV Everywhere, saying the merger put an "exclamation point" on their concern about control of online video.
 "The merged giant would have strong incentives to discriminate against other multi-channel video providers in granting access to its wealth of programming, including all of its broadcast stations and 'must-have' national and regional networks that air live or same-day sporting events, as well as the market power to enforce anticompetitive "bundling," they wrote. "The proposed deal could make it even harder for diverse and independent voices to find an audience, as Comcast would have the incentive to prioritize NBC channels and programs over others. Control of NBCU programming also would give Comcast the opportunity to prioritize its own online video products over those of its competitors - or sharply reduce online video distribution altogether - pushing independent producers out of the picture."
 The groups branded "merely window dressing" Comcast's public interest proposals, outlined by Comcast Executive VP David Cohen in a memo released at the time of the deal.
 They said that promises to extend program access rules to broadcast and HD programming would not mitigate the potential "danger" of vertical integration or get at the concern over online video distribution. "To prevent a disastrous impact on competition and consumer choice, any approval of the merger must include meaningful conditions that extend well beyond those previously imposed on less significant mergers."
 "In its ads, Comcast and NBCU ask people to 'Dream Big' but small cable operators know this deal will be a nightmare for its millions of customers without appropriate conditions," ACA President Mattt Polka said.
 The coalition's move was not a big surprise.
 In an interview with B&C/Multi on the eve of the merger announcement, Polka, whose group represents about 900 smaller and midsized cable operators, signaled his group could have big problems with the merger. "I am sure that we will be working with other industry and consumer groups suggesting quite aggressively the harms to consumers that will result from this [merger]," he said at the time.
 The letter comes a day after the Justice Department drew the long straw in deciding whether it or the Federal Trade Commission would review the merger. Comcast is expected to file the deal for review by Justice in the next few days.
 The eclectic group, which includes those opposed to the deal outright and those who have suggested it needs major government conditions, comprises American Cable Association, Center for Media Justice, Common Cause, Communications Workers of America, Concerned Women of America, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers Union, Free Press, Kids First Coalition Media Action Grassroots Network, Media Access Project, Media and Democracy Coalition, Morality in Media, National Association of Independent Networks National Consumer League, National Organization for Women, National Telecommunications Cooperative Association, Organization for the Promotion and Advancement of Small Telecommunications Companies, Parents Television Council Public Knowledge, Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association Sports Fans Coalition, U.S. PIRG, Writers Guild of America East, Writers Guild of America West.

Casio is set to be the latest player in the smartwatch fray. Reports suggest the Japanese watchmaker is currently developing its own tech timepiece, and plans to release it by the end of March 2016.
 The wearable tech race is really hotting up. Tech brands like Apple, LG and Motorola have released smartwatches, and now established watch companies like Tag Heuer are having a piece of the action. But the latest contender is none other than Casio, which reportedly has big plans for 2016.
 According to The Wall Street Journal – which cites sources familiar with the project – Casio plans to release a smartwatch by the end of March next year.
 Unlike other examples, this one is apparently more like a watch with smart capabilities rather than a true smartwatch. Sources claim the Casio smartwatch is affordable, "won't break easily, is simple to put on and feels good to wear."
 The report noted that this new product was announced as one of Casio's founding four brothers stepped down after being president for 27 years. His son is now in charge, and that means Casio is being helmed by a newer, younger generation. With that in mind, the company wants to craft its own wearable – one that doesn't break the bank and is comfortable to don.
 As for its purpose, the Casio smartwatch will be aimed at men who have an interest in outdoor sports and leisure. Apparently this will not only be reflected in its design but also functionality – which suggests some kind of fitness tracking technology will be on board.
 Sources claim Casio is thinking about slapping a $400 (about £250) price tag on it, which would price it higher than a lot of Android Wear watches, but that's not set in stone. Considering its lack of tech, we'd expect it to arrive for less.
 The Casio smartwatch is tipped to launch in March 2016. No other details, including specs, have been announced but we'll update when we hear more.

He was an exemplary husband who loved me without holding back. I cannot stop relieving the memories of waking up in the night to the face of a man staring at my face and smiling. The first time I noticed that, I was startled to the nerves. I woke up and suddenly saw my man staring at my face and smiling. One of those days, I asked how long he had been staring and he said "not too long ago" (maybe so I don't freak out). He said he could not stop admiring me. He made me feel so good and comfy in my skin. I also recall that when I was hospitalised, I woke up (unknown to him) and saw a grown man in his uniform crying and asking God to put the illness on him rather than watch me being ill. That grown man was my husband! He showered so much love on our son and me. He could not bear grudges; if we disagreed on an issue, he would make sure we made up without delay. When I'm pissed off, I prefer to keep mute and stay on my own but my husband could not take the silent treatment. If he had tried to gist with me and I was still forming 'angry bird', he would set up an emergency family Bible study time. He would make us study the _Word,_ pray together and in the course of praying, he would raise really hilarious prayer points such that I would have started chuckling even before the prayer is over. He made it so easy for us to settle our differences and taught me seamless dispute resolution.

The club legend opted for a diamond in the middle of the park and it saw Scott McTominay and Fred play just ahead of holding midfielder Nemanja Matic, with Fernandes, a goalscorer on the day, playing in his favoured attacking midfield role.
 Pogba could instantly go straight back into the side alongside Fred as part of the middle two, which in turn would give the United boss a tough choice between Matic and McTominay for the anchor role.
 A way of ensuring that all his key midfielders start at the same time, the formation also allows Solskjaer the chance to opt for two strikers full of pace and energy in Rashford and Anthony Martial.
 The Norwegian, injury permitting, has the chance to field a very exciting starting XI and he could well unleash it at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Friday, June 19.

Michael Skarzynski, president and CEO of Arbitron has been   ousted and replaced by board member William Kerr as word came from Washington that a   powerful legislator was looking into whether the executive misled them in   testimony on the company's Portable People Meters.     
 According to the company, Skarzynski resigned after the   board concluded he had "violated a company policy in a matter entirely   unrelated to the financial performance of the company."     
 An Arbitron spokesperson would not comment on the reasons   for the departure, but Edolphus Towns (D-NY), chairman of the House Government   Oversight Committee, said he had received information Jan. 11 that Skarzynski   "may have provided false testimony at a December2, 2009 hearing" of his committee.     
 "As Chairman, I am committed to protecting the   integrity of the Committee's proceedings," said Towns in a statement,   "and will review this matter to determine whether the Committee was intentionally   misled and whether further action is warranted."     
 Arbitron has been under scrutiny in Washington, including on the Hill and at the   FCC, for its Portable People Meters, which critics say undercount minorities.   Arbitron has said it has been working to improve the technology, which it   stands behind.     
 Towns committee released a report back in September   concluding that, among other things, "the ratings company was not   sufficiently recruiting Spanish-dominant Hispanics for its survey." Arbitron   countered that the conclusions were erroneous.     
 The report was released after the committee subpoenaed the   Media Ratings Council for documents of its oversight of the PPM. MRC was   created by Congress back in the 1960s to independently vet media ratings, though   its seal of approval is not necessary for a company or technology to operate in   the space.     
 Kerr has been a director since 2007 and has been chairman of   the board of Meredith. He has also been on the boards of Interpublic Group,   Whirlpool and the Principal Financial Group.     
 "Bill's service as a member of Arbitron's Board of   Directors should provide a fast and effective transition into his new role,"   said Arbitron Board Chair Philip Guarascio.

Satellite and telco operators seeking access to cable-owned   sports programming were high-fiving over the FCC's vote to end the exemption of   terrestrially-delivered networks, particularly sports networks, from being made   available to competitors. But they were beaten to the punch by the FCC's   chairman who began the torrent of sports-related metaphors with his own   shout-out for the order.
 "The Commission takes an important step in promoting   competition, empowering consumers, and fostering innovation by closing a loophole   in our program access rules," said Julius Genachowski. "The loophole   gives free reign to cable-TV operators to lock up local sports events and other   popular programming and withhold them from rival providers. Locking up a   much-loved local sports franchise could be game, set, match for cable   competition," he said. "Consumers who want to switch video providers   shouldn't have to give up their favorite team in the process. Today the   Commission levels the competitive playing field."
 "The Federal Communications Commission gave sports fans   a reason to tailgate today by adopting rules to bring sports programming to   more video providers," blogged AT&T Senior VP Bob Quinn Wednesday (Jan. 20). "Ultimately,   this means consumers will have more choices in how and from who they receive   programming they want.
 We are hopeful that with these new rules, consumers in   Connecticut will no longer have to watch their favorite sports teams in   standard definition just because they want to sign up for AT&T's   award-winning U-Verse video service, nor will baseball fans in San Diego have   to give up the Padres to make the same choice."
 "This is a big-time victory for television sports fans,"   said Kathleen Grillo, senior VP of federal regulatory affairs at Verizon. "The FCC's decision to make must-see regional   sports programming, including high-definition feeds, presumptively available to   competitors, puts viewers in the driver's seat. This ruling means that   consumers will no longer have to stick with their incumbent cable provider in   order to watch local teams in high definition."
 Satellite operators were equally buoyed by the news.
 "The FCC's order today eliminating the terrestrial loophole   is a big win for consumers and fair competition in the marketplace," said   DirecTV in a statement. "We vigorously applaud the FCC for recognizing   that withholding cable-owned regional sports networks from non-cable   competitors significantly hinders competition and is anti-consumer. We are   looking forward to offering DirecTV customers the local sports programming they   have been denied for so many years."
 "Dish Network congratulates the FCC for delivering   consumers a double victory," said that company in a statement.   "First, sports fans in Philadelphia and San Diego will soon have   a choice of pay-TV providers; second, consumers can no longer be held hostage   during a contract dispute between cable programmers and video distributors. Dish   Network thanks Chairman Genachowski for his leadership and for standing up for   consumers and competition."
 There is a pending program access complaint against Cox in   San Diego, and while there is no complaint in Philly, Comcast Sports Net has   been exempt from program access conditions applied to the Adelphia merger to   the extent it was unavailable at the time of the order. Now, the FCC says an multichannel   video programming distributor (MVPD) not getting access to that net can now   file a complaint under the new order.
 Even some cable operators, the smaller and midsized ones   represented by the American Cable Association, appeared not to be opposed   to the decision, suggesting it was in the public interest: "Over the   years, the American Cable Association has kept a close eye on the availability   of terrestrially-delivered programming controlled by vertically integrated   cable operators," said ACA President Matt Polka. "As a general   matter, ACA believes that the public interest is best served when multichannel video   programming distributors have access to all programming on nondiscriminatory   terms and conditions."

 Though Minnesota is viewed as progressive, it ranks among the country’s worst when it comes to racial disparity. That extends to prisons -- black people represent about 7 percent of the state’s population, but make up 36% of those behind bars.
 “I believe that all of us -- police, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, corrections officials -- are complicit. I am complicit,” said Perry Moriearty, a University of Minnesota Law School professor. “We continue to operate within a system that, from its earliest days, has disproportionately criminalized, arrested, prosecuted, locked up and executed black and brown people.”
 Laws enacted 30 years ago have led to over sentencing. In Minnesota, it’s possible to get life in prison just for being at the scene of a murder. And violent crimes are almost never commuted because a unanimous vote is required by the governor, attorney general and chief Supreme Court justice.

The country of 38 million people has so far reported 26,780 cases of COVID-19, including 1,157 deaths and 12,998 recoveries.
 Poland introduced anti-virus lockdown measures relatively early in March, which could account for its lower death toll from the disease than those of some western European countries.
 However, some experts warn the tally of infections could be skewed downward because of limited testing of the general population.

Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W. Va.) has come out in   favor of the FCC's request for more time to complete its broadband plan.
 "Congress tasked the Federal Communications Commission   to develop a national broadband plan to make sure all Americans have access to   broadband and to establish benchmarks to reach that goal," Rockefeller   said in a statement. "Broadband access is enormously critical to our   country's economic growth and can significantly improve countless lives by   expanding employment opportunities, health care, education and government   services. Crafting an effective national broadband plan is a challenging   and important task. Chairman Genachowski has indicated that a short delay   is necessary to qualitatively improve the plan. I support his   efforts."
 The FCC was getting support Thursday (Jan. 7) from various   quarters for its request for another four weeks to finish the broadband plan   (it had been due Feb. 17).
 According to sources, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.)   ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee was said to be OK with the   delay so long as the result at the end of the day was a report with meat on the   bone and not just a "plan for a plan."
 A House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Henry   Waxman (D-Calif.) had not returned calls for comment at press time.
 Robert Quinn, AT&T's senior VP of federal and regulatory   affairs, called it a reasonable request and said the company supported the   delay.
 "The FCC's broadband team has been working virtually 24   hours a day, collecting enormous amounts of data to develop a comprehensive   broadband plan for the country," he said. "If Chairman Genachowski   believes that the Commission needs an additional 30 days to work on the plan,   then that is certainly a reasonable request and one we fully support. The most   important thing is getting this right, not meeting a deadline."
 Public Knowledge, frequently on the other side of arguments   from AT&T, was on the same page. "We are pleased that the FCC has   decided to take the extra time it needs to complete the National Broadband   Plan. This is a very complex undertaking that will be crucial for the   development of the American economy," said Public Knowledge President Gigi   Sohn, adding that she hoped the FCC would use the time to develop a   "bold" strategy to increase choice and spur new content and services.

Water quality at Europe's beaches has steadily improved in recent years, with the vast majority boasting excellent quality, a new report said Monday.
 Among 22,295 bathing spots studied last year, 84.6 percent had "excellent" water quality, the report published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) found.
 Since 2013, the number of sites in this category has risen by 2.2 points to 87.4 percent for coastal bathing waters, and by 2.6 points to 79.1 for inland bathing waters.
 Researchers studied the water for bacteria indicating pollution caused by sewage or water drainage from farms.
 Water quality can be classified as "excellent", "good", "sufficient" or "poor", depending on the level of faecal contamination detected.
 Polluted waters can, if ingested, cause illness, including gastrointestinal problems and diarrhoea.
 Countries with waters qualified as "poor" should ban bathing or advise against it, the EEA said.
 Albania registered the highest number of sites with poor water quality, at 5.9 percent, but the number has nonetheless been halved in four years thanks to the construction of water treatment plants.
 Water quality tends to be better in coastal areas, thanks to their capacity for self-purification.
 "Moreover, many central European inland bathing water sites are situated on relatively small lakes and ponds as well as low flow rivers, which, especially in the summer, are more susceptible than coastal areas to short-term pollution caused by heavy summer rains," the report said.
 Cyprus topped the report, with 99.1 percent of its beaches boasting excellent water quality.
 The study covered EU member states as well as Albania, the UK and Switzerland.
 Greece, popular with tourists for its beaches, came in fourth at 95.7 percent, behind Austria and Malta.
 They were followed by Croatia, Germany and Portugal, while Denmark, Italy and Spain tied in eighth place with 88.4 percent.
 The EAA noted that in general, beaches on the Mediterranean tended to have cleaner water.
 "The European results show better quality in the Mediterranean, partly explained by low or no rain during the summer, more sun (sunlight kills bacteria) and deeper water at the beaches," EEA water quality expert Peter Kristensen told AFP.

Workers at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris on Monday began the delicate task of removing tons of metal scaffolding that melted together during the fire that destroyed the monument's roof and spire last year, one of the riskiest operations in the rebuilding effort so far.
 Around 40,000 tubes were fused into a tangled mass in the intense heat of the blaze, and must be removed without further damaging the limestone walls supporting the gothic vault.
 Half of the metal remains suspended some 40 metres (130 feet) above the church's floor.
 "When all this is taken care of, we'll be extremely relieved because the cathedral will have been saved," said Christophe Rousselot, director general of the Fondation Notre-Dame, the charity that is overseeing the collection of donations to the cathedral.
 "Pieces of the scaffolding could fall and weaken parts of the walls," he said, describing the work as "very complicated, with a sizable degree of risk."
 A telescopic lift carried workers into the middle of the structure for a last evaluation, and a towering crane installed at the site brought up equipment.
 Later this week, workers will be suspended by ropes to start sawing apart the scaffolding, an operation expected to last through the summer, Rousselot said.
 The scaffolding had been installed for a renovation of the spire that was being carried out when the fire erupted on the evening of April 15, 2019.
 Millions of people around the world watched as the fire tore through the church's roof, causing its steeple to collapse and sending billowing fumes containing toxic molten lead into the air.
 Firefighters worked throughout the night to keep Notre-Dame from collapsing completely, though officials have said the structure remains at risk.
 \- Five-year goal -
 Workers first had to install a new lattice of scaffolding to encompass the roughly 40 tonnes (88,000 pounds) of molten metal and stabilise it as well as the fire-scarred walls of the 13th-century masterpiece.
 Two teams of five will take turns cutting away the tubes one by one while hanging from rope harnesses.
 Once the tubes are cleared a more durable temporary roof can be installed to protect the cathedral's priceless artworks from rain, allowing actual restoration work to begin, though officials have said that might not start until next year.
 Marking the first anniversary of the disaster in April, President Emmanuel Macron reiterated his goal of restoring Notre-Dame to its former glory by 2024.
 But the renovation has been slowed by a series of delays, including the recent halt during the coronavirus lockdown that kept the 60 to 70 workers at home.
 Work had already been stopped last year to remove the lead particles that settled on the site when the metal panelling in the roof melted.
 Heavy concentrations of the metal settled on the square in front of the cathedral and on nearby streets that proved particularly difficult to remove, sparking fears that residents could be exposed to poisoning.
 Several schools were closed for weeks as workers decontaminated classrooms and playgrounds, and the square in front was reopened to visitors only last month.
 Countless other cleaning and restoration operations await, and the project's chief architect Philippe Villeneuve has warned that new challenges could arise as the work progresses.
 Officials must also still decide on whether to rebuild the cathedral exactly as it was, or incorporate modern materials.
 Macron has said he is open to adding a "contemporary" touch to the spire, for example, and plans to invite architects worldwide to make proposals.
 The fire prompted an outpouring of funds from donors worldwide, with more than 900 million euros (nearly $1 billion) given or pledged by some 340,000 companies and individuals.

OJ never saw me as a competition. For every dream I have nursed, we would pray and fund it together until it became reality. He knew I always wanted to have a post grad degree abroad so he registered me for another online Masters programme with the University of South Wales through UNICAF, shortly before his demise. He also joined in doing chores at home; he never considered himself too big to help out. He was an amazing father to our son. Through delivery, he was right by my side in the ward taking in all my yells and labour drama. At some point, he told me to reduce my voice and consider other patients on admission in the hospital. I yelled at him and asked him to leave my room. He left very calmly because he knew I was "under the influence". _That 's not the regular Tosin_. Few minutes later, guess who was calling for her husband to return to the ward and give her a back massage? Me! When our baby finally came forth, he made the first contact with him, held him in his arms and prayed so fervently for him before the nurses took him for their routine. Work did not avail him 24/7 presence at home but he was always present with us. WhatsApp and IMO were our favourite apps for video calls.

Most of the world has lived in lockdown in the past few months and it completely changed the way people work. Nevertheless, maintaining the economy requires that many people, if not all, will inevitably be going back to work in office buildings. Could smart buildings offer solutions for a healthier and much safer workplace in the long run? They probably can, the question is at what cost.

CNN) -- Thousands of brave souls have ventured into the Rocky Mountains for the past decade, searching for a treasure chest filled with gold, rubies, emeralds and diamonds.
 But that adventure has finally come to an end. The treasure has been found.
 Forrest Fenn, the 89-year-old art and antiquities collector who created the treasure hunt, made the announcement Sunday on his website.
 "It was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago," Fenn wrote in his announcement. "I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot."

The government is all set to reduce turnover tax for different sectors of the economy. The government has slashed all heads of non-development expenditure such as procuring vehicles, petrol, filling of vacancies and defence budget was also curtailed by Rs50 billion than its initially envisaged demand. All this exercise has created cushion and the government increased the development budget outlay at federal level from Rs530 billion to Rs650 and to Rs700 billion for the next budget 2020-21.
 Without having net revenue impact in the upcoming budget, the FBR will be assigned tax collection target of Rs4.95 trillion during next fiscal year 2020-21. “It will be low inflationary budget,” said one of the participants of budget making exercise while talking to ‘The News’ here on Sunday night.
 The official sources said that the government decided in principle that there would be no additional tax burden in the coming budget as some tax measures would be taken but overall there would be no net revenue measures. “It indicates that there will be net relief in the budget,” said the official.
 They said that the government would have to generate desired revenue collection to the tune of Rs4.95 trillion in the next budget to align with the macroeconomic framework envisaged by the IMF for reviving Pakistan’s economy back on the track.
 “Pakistan cannot afford derailment of IMF programme so all such measures will be taken that can protect the existing Fund programme,” said the official.
 They were of the view that the tax incentives would be granted to COVID-19 hit sectors such as hotel industry, airlines, poultry and retailers. The retailers for tier-1 tax is likely to be reduced, as efforts are underway to convince the IMF, said the sources. The cement sector is also under consideration for provision of relief in the next budget.
 However, the sources said that the government will have to strike balance in order to generate tax revenues so that the FBR collection can reach to its desired target of over Rs4.92 to Rs4.95 trillion in the next budget.
 The withdrawal of zero rating regime for five export-oriented sectors will not be reversed but such measures will be protected in the next budget. The official said that the tariff rationalisation will be done with the major objective to boost industrialisation in the next fiscal year.

Spurs, like many others, are feeling the tight squeeze of the football shutdown and what comes next with the restrictions on crowds.
 Many will wonder why with the record profits Tottenham have reported in previous years - albeit before that transfer spend last season - the club is not in a place to compete with Chelsea as they go for the Werners of the game.
 What has hit Spurs the hardest is that they have put all their eggs into an enormous stadium-sized basket.
 The £1.2billion Tottenham Hotspur Stadium complex is one of the most impressive in world football but amid the current problems facing the world, it had been rendered pretty much useless until crowds return.
 The Premier League games being played behind closed doors for the five remaining home matches of this season and an unknown number in the next campaign means lost millions in gate receipts as well as food, drink and merchandise and that is only the start.
 Other sports events such as NFL games, Anthony Joshua's heavyweight title defence and rugby matches have been cancelled, as have concerts galore booked to take place at the ground and all of the income Tottenham had coming to them has vanished.
 Spurs announced this week that they are estimating an enormous £200million in losses over the next financial year.
 They secured a £175million loan from the Bank of England, taking advantage of the 0.5 per cent interest rate on offer for companies affected by the pandemic.
 They did so with the very clear message that the loan would not be used for player purchases.

Corridors of power in the federal capital seem to be oblivious of the implication of the narrative of let the contagion take its own course considering people offer the ultimate solution to the pandemic. This laissez faire policy of the government has apparently shifted the responsibility to the people to contain and exterminate the Covid-19 virus that has been spreading and killing the people with vengeance. Its ferocity has been continuing and gaining grim momentum in the face of government’s declared reluctance to enforce comprehensive restrictions measuring up to the challenge of the pandemic. The entitlement of state as motherly- figurehead is in tatters indeed.
 It is uphill task at this stage when pandemic is on the rise and its receding seems a far-fetched cry when reviewed in the context of ground realities. The action plan based on ‘saving lives and livelihood’ simultaneously may result in mind-numbing results in the final analysis. Already the infection has touched the abhorrent figure in the closest proximity, or more, of one hundred thousand by the end of the last week. The peak is yet expected during the second fortnight of the current month, if not later. The staggering figures may sink the whole country in the morass of the pandemic with chilling accumulative pitfalls for the lives and the livelihood, God forbid! The countries those had rationalised the policy of lockdown by according priority to save lives were now reaping the dividends because they had succeeded in saving the lives of their citizens and the resultant recovery of their economies on the fast track trajectory.
 The message of the government to the people of the Pakistan is explicitly loud and clear: you are at your own and you have to fend for yourself from the rampage of the coronavirus as government was not contemplating to re-impose the lockdown. The abdication of the responsibility by government is though regretful but has thankfully made it abundantly clear to the people that they are in the midst of tempest without help from any side. Not shocking because its indications were quite clear in the beginning as the government was quite hesitant to impose full-fledged restrictions of lockdown to stem the pandemic. It may not be out of place to mention that the (WHO), doctors’ representative organizations including the world known experts have supported the easing of lockdown restrictions only after attaining the flattening followed by the dropping of the curve without pause. However, policy planners in Islamabad were not inclined to pay heed to the experts’ warning and decided to lift restrictions prematurely when the infection was surging to the exponential proportion. Proverbial ‘cart before the horse’ was the official policy in its dealing with the containment of the infection. Punjab government’s recent report on the extent of infection in Lahore should have forced the government to revise its policy but the fixation remained struck in a rut to the collective chagrin of the people.
 PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has strongly criticised the government strategy that sabotaged the Sindh government’s strict policy to contain the contagion. It is widely believed that mixed messaging and unwarranted interference seemingly fabricated to scuttle Sindh government much acclaimed policy both at national and international levels, was upsetting the government leadership in Islamabad. PPP leader Maula Bux Chandio also recently referred to the excessive fiddling of the federal government in Sindh that had hugely contributed in the exponential surge of the infections in Sindh province.
 This country can least afford the divisive politics, the government leadership is so fond of, during the telling times when national unity is the dire need to overcome the challenges fraught with existential threats. The ensuing aftermaths of these challenges if not forestalled with prudence may surely weave the net around the neck of its undertakers in the final analysis. The snowball impact may spare no one, and therefore the doubly egregious alacrity of vengeance may give way to tolerance, understanding, and accommodation to build national consensus to overcome the challenges those have the potential to tear into all walks of nation building process. The government leadership’s juggernaut imbedded in bullying is surely an abomination that will not bode well in any way. The underway witch-hunting may let loose the vicious cycle to undermine the edifice in its all forms and manifestations.
 Politics of vendetta is cyclical and it comes home to roost to continue to ravage cascade of havocs on body politics as collateral. The lack of will and motivation on the part of government leadership for building bridges is not good news for the democracy. Every sane voice in the country has been earnestly advocating the urgent need of national unity, but to no avail so far. Nothing can be more hostile to the country than this type of political shenanigans.
 The propensity of the incumbent leadership to get-it-alone to the exclusion of the other political forces may not see the light of the day anyway. The participatory/pluralistic democracy, reflecting the aspirations of the people, is the model that should guide the ruling party instead of the authoritarian rule behind the veil of democracy. The track record of the governance of this government may not surprise many for not translating many laurels in myriad fields qualifying for of worth mentioning. To substantiate the point only the failures and successes of the post corona period will be stated here because the Covid-19 has badly affected all countries across the board. No country, whether super power or the poor country could evade its ghastly negative effects to their economies and public health sectors in particular.
 The people may ask the question to themselves if they are better off as compared to the previous government. The answer may be vastly in negative. The comparison is confined to the two governments for the sake of the convenience of all and sundry. The data and figures of the economy may lead the people to judge the former governments as better choice of them than the (PTI) government. Also the future prospects for them may seemingly look a faint-hope based on their experience during the last more than two years of this government. Their sufferings have multiplied relentlessly without respite. People have been bracing the hellfire of inflation cursing the mandarins because they find it difficult to make both ends meet especially those who are on the tether end of the food chain.
 The platitudes of ‘mega corruption’ by the PTI leadership over and over seemingly have also lost its appeal among the people because most of the corruption cases could not stand the witness box ,or the national watchdog could not file references even after lapse of months or even years of custody of the accused. This has further intensified the growing views of political victimisation. Former Chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa while addressing the function of the judiciary stated,’ that the growing perception that accountability process being pursued in the country at present is lopsided and is a part of political engineering is a dangerous perception and some remedial steps need to be taken urgently so that the process does not lose credibility’.
 Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was seemingly right when he stated as what happened to Saaf Pani Case including of Ashiana Housing Scheme those were registered to punish the PML-N president. He was talking to media after the Lahore High Court granted pre-arrest bail to Shahbaz Sharif, PML-N resident. Those cases seemingly have disappeared from the official utterances after browbeating the Opposition leader. The Ashiana Housing Scheme case has reportedly been taken up again by the national watchdog after former prime minister‘s media talk in Lahore. It is not difficult to imagine the obvious.
 The employment situation was much better during the watch of previous governments, dollar parity with rupee was Rs104 now Rs160 and exports have not been showing corresponding increase despite unprecedented devaluation of the rupee, the ransacking of Debt Responsibly and Limitation Act due to heavy borrowings by the this government has pushed the country into unforgiving debt trap, import of reported about one million tones of wheat this year also means an embarrassment for the nation for losing the status of Pakistan as Food Secured Country attained during PPP government led by Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani. Downward revision of revenue generation targets by plugging the loopholes of corruption in the (FBR) and broadening the tax base has also hit the wall. In fact, the revenue collected by this government is less than the previous government in real terms when calculated keeping in view the level of devaluation.
 The GDP growth estimated around 2.8% is now a forlorn hope. Dr. Hafeez Pasha, an eminent Economist who has served at the very high positions here in Pakistan and International Organizations predicted last year, ‘8 million people may go below poverty line during next two fiscal years (2019-20), inflation double digit, debt servicing will eat up Rs2.6 trillion as Pakistan needs to pay $40 billion during the period of two years’. His dire forecasting may be close to reality when seen the overall condition of the economy before coronavirus struck like a bolt from the sky.

Sinclair   and Mediacom have agreed to an eight-day interim carriage agreement.
 The   deal is at terms set by Sinclair, according to a Mediacom source, and at a   price higher than the current one.
 FCC   Chairman Julius Genachowski, who praised the move Thursday, urged the parties   to strike a long-term deal, but said the FCC would not step in to extend   carriage past that Jan. 8 date. He also said he had asked Fox and Time Warner   to follow suit and agree to an extension.
 Both   carriage contracts are set to expire Dec. 31. The extension protects Mediacom   subscribers' access to a bunch of college bowl games, including the Jan. 4   Orange Bowl and Jan. 7 national championship game. The extension affects 24   stations and viewers in 12 states.
 "Our   viewers are very important to us and we responded to their interest in being   able to watch, via Mediacom, programs meaningful to them over the next eight   days," said Sinclair EVP and General Counsel Barry Faber in announcing the   extension. "We recognize that several of the impacted markets have college   teams that will be playing in the BCS Bowl games. Although our stations are   available for free over-the-air and from Mediacom's competitors, we thought it   was important to ensure that our viewers had the opportunity to see those games   without inconvenience."
 "We're   pleased that the Orange Bowl and national championship game can't be held   hostage any longer," said Mediacom spokesman Tom Larsen. "We're going   to continue to work with Sinclair and the FCC and all the politicians who have   weighed in and try to get a deal done in eight days."
 "I   commend Sinclair and Mediacom for agreeing to an eight-day extension of their   retransmission consent agreement, which was set to expire tonight," said   FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski. "This extension, to midnight Jan. 8,   2010, will avert the frustration that Mediacom customers would have experienced   if Sinclair stations had ceased to be available over Mediacom systems at   midnight tonight. It will give Sinclair and Mediacom additional time to resolve   their negotiations successfully, as hundreds of other broadcasters and cable   companies have done throughout the country, so that viewers will have   uninterrupted access to popular broadcast programming," he said.
 Broadcasters   have been increasingly arguing that their signals deserve cash payments and   ones more in line with what top cable nets receive. Certainly the attention   paid by Capitol Hill to the potential loss of college bowl games suggests the   signals are valuable, though must-have sports, including bowl games, are   increasingly moving to cable platforms.
 "I   hope and expect that the parties will use this extension to come to terms by   the January 8 expiration date," Genachowski said. "But at the end of   the day, the companies will have to accept shared responsibility for protecting   their audience's interests, as the current framework governing retransmission   consent agreements contemplates. Assuming that the parties negotiate in   good faith during the extension, therefore, I will not seek a further   continuation of carriage absent a new agreement between the parties."
 That   was fine with Faber: "We applaud the FCC 's message to Mediacom not to   expect government intervention if the parties are unable, through the exercise   of good faith negotiations, to reach agreement during the 8-day   extension," he said.
 The Genachwoski   reference to "good faith" is important, however. Mediacom complained   to the FCC that Sinclair was not bargaining in good faith, and asked for an   emergency carriage mandate while it considered the complaint. It could   still mandate carriage if it concluded Mediacom had made its case.
 Genachwoski   was also looking to make sure that the Time Square ball was the only thing   dropped at midnight--The Time Warner/Fox retrans deal includes New York.
 "I   have urged Fox and Time Warner Cable to agree to a temporary extension of   carriage if they do not come to terms on a new carriage agreement today,"   added Genachwoski, "in order to prevent disruption to their viewers.   Companies shouldn't force cable-watching football fans to scramble for other   means of TV delivery on New Year's weekend," Genachowski said.
 The Sinclair   extension came not long after Mediacom circulated a letter to Sen. John Kerry   (D-Mass.) dated Dec. 31, saying the cable operator late Thursday night got a   "tentative indication" from Sinclair that "they might consider a   very short-term extension of our agreement." Cmmisso gave Kerry credit for   prompting the thaw.
 Sinclair   could have pulled its TV station signals from Mediacom systems at midnight   tonight absent a retransmission consent deal that has yet to materialize.
 Sinclair   has been asking for more than Mediacom is willing to pay, but the cable   operator offered to pay that contested price for a three-month period while   negotiations continued. That would have kept the signals on the systems through   the college bowl game blitz of early January as well as the Super Bowl. Kerry   has been actively pushing the parties to resolve the disputes.
 Sinclair   countered that it would agree to a year extension at its asking price, but that   the three-month extension would shift leverage to Mediacom because of its   inclusion of some of that must-have programming. The retrans deal impasse has   been for a year contract, anyway, so Sinclair was effectively countering with   its standing offer.
 Larsen   said he remained optimistic that a long-term deal could be done.

(KPLC) - With Cristobal now well inland, the storm has been downgraded to a tropical depression and was centered about 40 miles NW of Baton Rouge and on a north-northwesterly push at about 10 mph. The storm will continue to weaken but is still producing storm surge and inland flooding from SE Louisiana through parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, well east of the where the storm made landfall.Afternoon tropical downpours todayThe impacts will continue to remain greatest to our north and east, but some increasing tropical rains this afternoon as we see some of the rain bands move in by this afternoon, although our risk of flooding and severe weather remains very minimal. Models indicate rain amounts of at or less than one inch of rain today with just a few heavier downpours expected by this afternoon as the storm continues to depart the state.Wind ForecastBy this evening, rain chances will continue to decrease as winds turn back on onshore. This could create a minor coastal flooding issue for Cameron Parish during times of high tide later this afternoon and through Tuesday. Southerly winds will remain brisk at times through the day tomorrow and again could create some minor coastal flooding in Cameron tomorrow during times of high tide.Cristobal's trackTuesday should bring an overall drier day with fewer impacts as sunshine at times returns. The main impact tomorrow outside of the breeze will be the heat. Highs topping out in the lower to middle 90s will feel much hotter with humidity creating a heat index of up to 100. The chances of rain tomorrow are low during the day and evening but increase again late Tuesday night into Wednesday ahead of a front.Wednesday frontOur next weather maker arrives in the predawn hours of Wednesday as a front pushes through overnight.

Janez Lenarčič, European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Philippe Goffin, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence, and Jean-Yves Le Drian, French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, who cooperated in the mission, climbed on the plane too. Congo is still struggling to stop the eleventh Ebola epidemic, that, according to WHO figures, has infected approximately 3,500 people and killed 2,280, with a 66% death rate, and is now also challenged by Covid-19, which – also according to the WHO – has infected over 4 thousand people so far. In Kinshasa, the European leaders will meet president Félix Tshisekedi and the leaders of humanitarian and civilian organisations in the capital and in Goma. “Overcoming coronavirus in the long term means joining forces, especially with the African countries that are our mean partners”, Lenarcic explained. “Working in a supportive climate is in our common interest”. Overall, the EU’s humanitarian funds for the most vulnerable people in the DRC amount to 40.83 million euros in this 2020.

The App Store in Windows 8.1 is optimised for tablet PCs - and on a desktop or laptop machine it's oriented in landscape, so that you have to swipe from left to right. Most modern apps have had a bit of new polish - but it's most noticeable in Store.
 The front page is vertically scrolling and now looks pretty much exactly like the Apple App Store. The curated collections, the horizontal banding - even the featured apps at the top of the page.

One night a few years ago Mikayla, Alexis and Erica Houge were playing a game of pepper.
   
 Erica, the youngest Houge, was around six or seven years old at the time, and came up to try and field a ball as Mikayla was getting ready to bat. Mikayla, the oldest of the three, didn't like what little sister was doing.
   
 So she decided to teach her a lesson.
   
 "I ran up and Mikayla bunted it and hit me right in the face with the ball," Erica Houge said. "I just remember running inside crying and my dad was like, 'Why did you run up?'"
   
 It resulted in a black eye for Erica.
   
 "I just love that story," Mikayla Houge said. "We're competitive, and she was up close, and I said you need to get back - you're cheating! So I push-bunted at her and hit her in the face."
   
 The three sisters have spent their entire lives around the game of softball. Their father, Troy, is the current Collins-Maxwell head softball coach. He has been coaching since 2000 when he took over at Collins-Maxwell-Baxter.
   
 "We just grew up here at the field," Mikayla Houge said. "There's pictures of my dad's old teams, and they have me as a little 3- or 4-year-old on their shoulders."
   
 Now Mikayla is a senior, Alexis a sophomore and Erica just completed eighth grade at Collins-Maxwell. With Mikayla graduating and moving on to play Division I ball at Virginia next year, this will be the first and only season they all three get to play together on the same team.
   
 "I'm super excited," Mikayla Houge said. "This season is one that I've been looking forward to since I was younger. Everyone's like, 'Oh, you guys will get to play on the same team your senior year,' and I'm like yeah, it's gonna be really special.
   
 "Now it's here."
   
 The Houge sisters are extremely grateful they can suit up together this summer because they almost didn't get the chance.
   
 "I was very excited for it, and then Corona happened," Erica Houge said. "Then I was like, 'Oh no!'"
   
 After school was called off and spring sports were canceled due to COVID-19, it didn't look good for high school softball and baseball. But things started to settle down a bit in May, opening the door for the state, the Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union and the Iowa High School Athletic Association to approve both summer sports.
   
 "A few weeks ago, I didn't know if I was going to have that opportunity," Mikayla Houge said. "It's just really special, especially before I leave in the fall."
   
 They're certainly a great trio to have as teammates.
   
 "I like being on the team with the three Houge sisters," Collins-Maxwell senior outfielder Emma Kahler said. "It's nice talking to them about sibling stuff because they're the only other girls with siblings on the team."
   
 Kahler's twin sister, Ella, is also a Spartan.
   
 Each Houge brings something different to the table personality wise.
   
 "Mikayla's probably the most serious one," Troy Houge said. "Lexi is a little quieter, and Erica's the clown. That's kind of how they go."
   
 And they're all pretty good ball players.
   
 Mikayla is the ace pitcher and top power hitter on the team. Alexis is the speedy leadoff hitter and rangy shortstop.
   
 Erica can help out both on the mound and in the field.
   
 "Mikayla brings her talent on the mound and in the batter's box along with her leadership skills to the team," Emma Kahler said. "Lexi also brings the leadership and her hitting abilities, but she also has lots of speed and always keeps it intense while baserunning.
   
 "Erica is new to the team this year, but I believe she'll bring power to our lineup, and I think she'll be a strong leader in the upcoming years."
   
 Mikayla and Alexis have been there and done that.
   
 In the two years they've played together, Collins-Maxwell has won back-to-back Class 1A state championships. Mikayla and Alexis have made first-team all- state each time.
   
 After helping out with the scorebook last year, Erica is ready to get her chance to shine, though she may have to show some patience.
   
 "We don't know where Erica's going to fit in," Troy Houge said. "She gives us a good back-up pitcher that can give Mikayla some relief if she needs it. She can play other positions so if we need something somewhere we can do that, we have that luxury with her."
   
 Being the middle child, Alexis is the only one to play with both of her sisters on a regular basis.
   
 "I've had my moments with just her Mikayla and just Erica," Alexis Houge said. "Just being able to combine it all together and possibly so close together on the field - I think it's going to be a special occurrence that not a lot of people get to experience."
   
 Alexis is still learning from Mikayla, but now she's taking on her own leadership role.
   
 "Mikayla knows more about the team aspect - I'm getting there, but she'll be able to kind of control the reins a little bit more," Alexis Houge said. "I might have to focus on (Erica) a little bit."
   
 Their dad thinks they have the potential to be a pretty formidable trio.
   
 "The three of them work pretty well together," Troy Houge said. "At home, maybe not as much, but on the ball field, they work pretty well together."
   
 Erica is just ready to go from spectator to participant playing alongside her sisters.
   
 "I remember going to their games and watching what they do," Erica Houge said. "Watching the state championships, it really made me want to get out on the field with them."
   
 And that is the goal. Add a third sister, win a third state title.
   
 "That's all that we're working for," Mikayla Houge said. "That's what we want."
   
 Collins-Maxwell opens the season June 15 at home against rival Baxter.

"If you do what you love, you never have to work a day in your life.” That's an age-old adage, but it's particularly applicable to John Brenkus, co- founder/co-CEO of BASE Productions and host of _Sport Science_. Brenkus has held one job for his entire career, and even 17 years after starting the production company out of college, the exuberance he feels for television is palpable over the telephone.
 “I wake up every day and I consider myself to be blessed and very fortunate to work on programs that I'm passionate about,” Brenkus says. These days, he has a lot to feel good about, even if his job sometimes involves being thrown to the ground by an NFL tackle.
  _Sport Science_ , which first aired on the Fox Sports cable networks, was recently acquired by ESPN. The Emmy-winning sports technology show challenges long-held assumptions about what makes athletes successful, and utilizes BASE's signature fast-paced visual production techniques and use of motion- capture and CGI technology. At ESPN, it will appear as a standalone special and in segments as part of other network programming such as _College Football GameDay_ , as well as online.
 “ESPN is a very visionary network,” Brenkus says of _Sport Science_ 's new home. “This show is creating a new genre of programming. They understand how to get that brand out over many platforms….ESPN provides us with the biggest platform in the world to deliver that message.”
 On _Sport Science_ , Brenkus plays the Everyman foil, often putting himself in harm's way to illustrate a point. That was the case last spring when the show tested the hypothesis of whether an “average Joe” could withstand the punishment of going head-to-head against an NFL lineman. Brenkus (5'8”, 160 pounds) gladly stood in against New York Jets defensive tackle Kris Jenkins (6'4”, 360 pounds) and was promptly pounded into the ground.
 Playing that average Joe role is a bit misleading—Brenkus has participated in four Ironman triathlons—but the congenial host is quick to point out that he is nowhere near a world-class athlete.
 “If I'm going to do something, I'm going to do it all the way,” he says. “For me, it's an honor to be able to go up against [a great athlete], just to even try. The purpose of the show is to really illustrate how amazing these athletes are and how they do what they do. Throwing me nine feet in the air certainly does illustrate that.”
 Some shows are awe-inspiring even without such high-flying antics. A 2009 episode explored the mechanics behind throwing a perfect spiral. The _Sport Science_ team set out to find out if an NFL quarterback is more accurate zeroing in on a target than an Olympic archer. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees solved the riddle by hitting a bull's-eye from 20 yards away—on 10 straight attempts.
 Brenkus, a self-described “type AAA” personality, is certainly a self-starter. While attending college at the University of Virginia, he stopped into the Virginia Independent Film Office, then run by current AFI President/CEO Bob Gazzale. Gazzale told Brenkus about an up-and-coming film director named Steven Soderbergh who was in the area. “Maybe you should hunt him down,” Gazzale told Brenkus.
 The enterprising student did just that, tracking down Soderbergh at a screening of his 1991 film _Kafka_. Brenkus then earned course credit for learning about the film industry at the side of the young director.
 “His advice was, 'Do everything yourself,'” Brenkus says. “That was really the foundation for [BASE Productions]. I taught myself how to shoot and how to edit.”
 Brenkus teamed up with Mickey Stern, a law- and business-school graduate who also happened to be dating Brenkus' sister. Stern had been working as a real estate attorney but was looking to get into something he was more passionate about. The two hit it off immediately. “It's been a very powerful relationship,” Brenkus says.
 They co-founded BASE upon Brenkus' graduation from Virginia. Stern would eventually marry Brenkus' sister, making the two business partners and brothers-in-law.
 And business has been good since the company's inception. BASE's net and gross revenues have increased year-to-year since the company started, according to Stern. He says the company already has 75% of its 2009 revenue in the pipeline for 2010, even before a number of new show pitches have been made to networks.
 “He is the most intense, driven and talented guy you will ever meet,” Stern says. “He's been a 20-hour-a-day guy since the day I met him. That's his personality.” Stern adds that whether he's producing television, hosting a show or training for a triathlon, Brenkus gravitates toward challenges: “The harder something is, the more he likes it.”
 “He's got this genius brain with a childlike eagerness for information,” adds Ron Wechsler, ESPN's VP of series development and production. “It's really infectious. You don't leave a meeting with John thinking, 'Man, he's really not into this'....And John's personal knowledge of production and post- production are second to none.”
 In the early days of BASE, Stern managed the business affairs of the company while Brenkus handled creative. But over the years, Stern says the two have “worn both hats incredibly frequently.”
  _Sport Science_ is just one of a high-octane slate of shows BASE is producing. The roster includes A&E reality-based murder mystery _Crime 360_ , Spike TV's _Jesse James Is a Dead Man_ , National Geographic Channel's _Fight Science_ and G4's _Human Wrecking Balls_.
 Brenkus' love for film comes across in all of BASE's productions, which meld drama and powerful imagery for an intense viewer experience. “John's passions have always been both film and television,” Stern says. “The word we use a lot is 'cinematic.' Even if it's something that sounds like it's made for the small screen, there's always got to be build, got to be suspense and then there has to be a reveal.”
 But with a track record of compelling programming, a slew of awards and a new 26,000-square-foot facility in Los Angeles, Brenkus is still hungry to pitch the next hit. “I think passion sells,” he says. “Our philosophy in creating high-quality product is to have passion in what we're doing. We've never taken on a project that we're not passionate about.”

King Jaja of Opobo was reportedly born in Igboland in present day Nigeria in 1821. He was sold as a slave at an early age, but would gain his freedom through his aptitude for business. A successful trader, he eventually founded the state of Opobo and become its king, making Opobo a major exporter of palm oil. Beginning in the 1880s, disputes between British traders and the state of Opobo escalated to the point where the British sought to get rid of King Jaja. Tricked into attending a meeting to settle these trade disputes, King Jaja was arrested in 1887 when he arrived on board a British ship. He was later taken to present day Accra, Ghana and put on trial in November 1887. He was found guilty, with the punishment of banishment to the Caribbean.

Il nuovo vaccino quadrivalente adiuvato (aQiv) sara prodotto da Seqirus, uno dei maggiori produttori europei di vaccini antinfluenzali e leader mondiale nella prevenzione dell'influenza. Da oltre vent'anni in Italia il vaccino trivalente adiuvato viene utilizzato per la protezione della popolazione anziana, specialmente se a rischio. Nel Regno Unito, inoltre, il vaccino trivalente adiuvato e quello primariamente raccomandato nella fascia di eta superiore ai 65 anni. Nella stagione influenzale 2018/2019, il Sistema sanitario inglese ha effettuato uno studio che ha dimostrato come l'efficacia sul campo del vaccino trivalente adiuvato nel prevenire l'influenza confermata in laboratorio sia stata del 62% (3,4%, 85,0%). E' ben noto che nelle precedenti stagioni, quando veniva somministrato solo il vaccino non adiuvato a tutti i gruppi di eta, l'efficacia negli anziani era molto piu bassa rispetto a quella della popolazione adulta.

Windows 10 is about to arrive, and as you may be aware, Microsoft is making changes to the way Windows Update works in the new OS, with the company forcing updates to be installed for users of Windows 10 Home – but the latest news is that there is a workaround of sorts to avoid updates you don't want.
 With previous versions of Windows, you've always been able to choose whether to have updates automatically downloaded and applied, or to select which updates you want to install as and when.
 With Windows 10 Home, however, Microsoft is forcing automatic updates to ensure the user base is always running the latest patches and security fixes, to keep the desktop OS as watertight as possible across the board.
 Basically, it's a move which sacrifices freedom for tighter security, although there have been plenty of displeased Windows 10 beta testers grumbling about updates which have been piped through straight onto their machine, and have then caused trouble (new graphics drivers can be particularly troublesome).
 The interesting news, as ZDNet reports, is that there is a troubleshooter package for Windows 10 (KB3073930) which when downloaded gives users the option of hiding or blocking updates.
 What this means is that if Windows automatically installs an update or driver which subsequently causes issues on your system, you can uninstall that update, and then KB3073930 will allow you to hide the problematic patch from Windows so it won't ever attempt to install it again.
 So yes, this is a pretty clunky way of doing business, and hardly as convenient as having total oversight over which updates are installed – but it's at least something to turn to for those hitting problems.
 It'll be interesting to see if this forced update policy is something Microsoft will eventually do a U-turn on – perhaps for driver updates anyway, which are the most likely candidates to cause strife on your PC.
 At least the good news with Windows 10 is that there's far more to look forward to than dread.
