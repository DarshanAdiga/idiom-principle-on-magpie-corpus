In the two other El Paso City Council runoffs, District 2 incumbent city Rep. Alexsandra Annello faces her former office administrator, Miriam “Judy” Gutierrez, and District 4 city Rep. Sam Morgan faces retired police officer Joe Molinar.
 Annello and Gutierrez are campaigning hard door-to-door and with mailers.
 In the six-candidate general election for mayor Nov. 3, Leeser led the pack with 92,700 votes, or 44% of the total, and Margo was a distant second with 53,600 votes, or 25%.
 In contrast with the intense door-to-door and media campaigning for mayor leading up to Nov. 3, things have been strangely quiet since, with little in the way of mail-outs or door knocking, although both campaigns have continued to run some TV ads and the occasional newspaper insert or ad.
 “The one thing that has jumped out to me after the general election is that both candidates are essentially running stealth campaigns,” said Pineda, whose research and teaching in UTEP’s Communica
 “It’s hard for an incumbent to be that many points behind and come back,” Pineda said of Margo’s chances. “It’s not impossible, but you almost have to be in hyper mode and constantly aware of everything going on.
 “You have some very specific things you need to do in a runoff campaign,” he said. “The first thing is you’ve got to activate at least a portion of voters that came out for you the first time.”
 In the three weeks following the Nov. 3 election, Pineda said he received one mailer from Leeser but saw no new campaign signs going up or heard of any door knocking by supporters, much less the candidates themselves.
 Mayoral candidate Veronica Carbajal, who came in third, has endorsed Leeser, as have the three other candidates in the race – Carlos Gallinar, Dean “Dino” Martinez and Calvin Zielsdorf.
 The lull in campaigning could have something to do with all of the activity on the COVID-19 front that’s kept Margo busy and the recent death of Leeser’s 89-year-old mother, Rhoberta, Pineda said.
 “Or maybe the sense in the Leeser campaign is there’s no fear of losing, and in the Margo campaign, there’s no expectation of winning,” he said. “It’s one of the weirdest runoffs I’ve ever seen.”
 One longtime campaign veteran who asked not to be named said Leeser “doesn’t have to campaign.”
 “And if you’re Margo, what do you do to change the tide? What do you tell your donors?” he said. “And who does Dee target when the average voter is a 63-year-old Hispanic female?”
 If there is one big issue that clearly separates the two candidates, it’s the fate of the multipurpose performing arts center, or arena, that voters approved in the 2012 bond election.
 Despite the delays in getting the project going and the controversy over where to build it, Margo wants to stick with Plan A – build it in the historic Duranguito neighborhood even if the original price tag for a 15,000-seat facility has gone from the original $180 million to at least $250 million.
 Leeser said, “We told the citizens that we would give them a performing arts center, and we need to provide that. And I think the best place today would be at Abraham Chavez (Theater).
 “And then, second of all, we need to look at how we can develop the (Duranguito) area in a proper way, making sure that we enrich their culture and the beauty of our community.
 “How we’re going to do that is not the mayor’s decision, but as a whole, it’s our community decision.”
 Margo’s first step into politics was in 2011 when he ran for and won a seat in the Texas House of Representatives. Two years later, he was defeated for reelection by Joe Moody, who’s held the office for four terms since.
 Before getting into politics, he was a highly successful businessman who built JDW Insurance into the biggest independent agency in El Paso before selling the company in 2012 to Hub International.
 He has come under fire for raising taxes, bond sales not approved by voters, tax incentive packages for big developers and his heavy hand in dealing with outspoken citizens and council members at City Council meetings.
 As mayor he’s also had to make tough decisions when it comes to the city’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit El Paso harder than other Texas cities and attracted lots of negative national attention.
 Then, there’s the city’s unemployment rate, which peaked at 14.4% in April – the highest point in decades – as a result of COVID 19 measures, but has fallen since. It was 8.2% in September, according to Workforce Solution Borderplex’s most recent labor report.

As brides and grooms prepare to tie the knot in paradise, they think about all the details of the wedding day, both big and small. Some have their eyes set on the small things such as flowers and other décor, and other couples are focused on details around food and drinks.
 One thing that might not come to mind at first is thinking about where the couple is going to get ready leading up to the ceremony, and sometimes this ends up being in a cramped hotel room.
 Brides looking for the ideal spot to pamper themselves pre-wedding can look no further than the bridal suite at Paradisus Playa del Carmen. The resort knows these hours leading up to the ceremony are important ones, so they provide a large suite for the wedding party to enjoy.
 The suite offers plenty of space for bridesmaids to get their hair and make-up done, make toasts or simply enjoy the peace and quiet while preparing for the day’s festivities to come. In addition to having several rooms, it also has a terrace with a whirlpool bathtub.
 To top it off, the pastel colors and décor provide the perfect backdrop for getting all the best photos.

 Each panellist, owing to the age and scale of their establishments, was able to provide a distinct insight into the situation. Mr. Damodarasamy explained the challenges of a chain that has been “doing things a certain way” for decades, to change their functioning and structures. He also pointed out how people were still willing to walk up to a trusted restaurant for a favourite dish. “I had expected deliveries to become a much larger part of our operations, but people are clearly more open to takeout: they are willing to patiently stand in lines with social distancing.”
 Each restaurateur agreed that the 50% seating capacity ceiling mandated was not profitable. “Unlike a restaurant like Annapoorna, when you go to a fine dining restaurant, you don’t expect to bump elbows with people. It already has spaced out seating, and fewer customers,” said Mr. Damodarasamy. “If restaurants don’t function at 80% to 85% capacity, they don’t even break even,” Mr. Alhuwalia added. Ms. Varadarajulu explained how diners in more spaced out restaurants such as Latitude 49 were more relaxed and tended to stay longer than those in city establishments.

COVID-19 RELIEF
 Democrats have battled with Republicans and the White House for months over a fresh installment of COVID-19 relief that all sides say they want. But a lack of good faith and an unwillingness to embark on compromises that might lead either side out of their political comfort zones have helped keep another rescue package on ice.
 The aid remains out of reach despite a fragile economy and out-of-control increases in coronavirus cases, especially in Midwest GOP strongholds. McConnell has supplanted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as the most important Republican force in the negotiations, but he hasn't shown much openness for politically difficult compromises required for a COVID-19 deal that might anger conservatives. Neither have McConnell's warnings of a wave of COVID-related lawsuits against businesses, schools and nonprofits open during the pandemic come to pass, undercutting his demand for blanket protections against such suits.
 Pelosi seems to have overplayed her hand as she held out for $2 trillion-plus right up until the election. The results of the election, which saw Democrats lose seats in the House, appear to have significantly undercut her position, but she is holding firm on another round of aid to state and local governments.
 Before the election, Trump seemed to be focused on a provision that would send another round of $1,200 payments to most Americans. He hasn't shown a lot of interest in the topic since, apart from stray tweets. But the chief obstacles now appear to be Pelosi's demand for state and local government aid and McConnell's demand for a liability shield for businesses reopening during the pandemic.
 At stake is funding for vaccines and testing, reopening schools, various economic “stimulus" ideas like another round of “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses especially hard hit by the pandemic. Failure to pass a measure now would vault the topic to the top of Biden's legislative agenda next year.

 DEFENSE POLICY
 A spat over military bases named for Confederate officers is threatening the annual passage of a defense policy measure that has passed for 59 years in a row on a bipartisan basis. The measure is critical in the defense policy world, guiding Pentagon policy and cementing decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.
 Both the House and Senate measures would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The battle erupted this summer amid widespread racial protests, and Trump used the debate to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy. It's a live issue in two Senate runoff elections in Georgia that will determine control of the chamber during the first two years of Biden’s tenure.
 Democrats are insisting on changing the names and it's not obvious how it'll all end up.

 KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT OPEN
 At a bare minimum, lawmakers need to keep the government running by passing a stopgap spending bill known as a continuing resolution, which would punt $1.4 trillion worth of unfinished agency spending into next year.
 That's a typical way to deal with a handoff to a new administration, but McConnell and Pelosi are two veterans of the Capitol's appropriations culture and are pressing hard for a catchall spending package. A battle over using budget sleight of hand to add a 2 percentage point, $12 billion increase to domestic programs to accommodate rapidly growing veterans health care spending is an issue, as are Trump's demands for U.S-Mexico border wall funding.
 Getting Trump to sign the measure is another challenge. Two years ago he sparked a lengthy partial government shutdown over the border wall, but both sides would like to clear away the pile of unfinished legislation to give the Biden administration a fresh start. The changeover in administrations probably wouldn't affect an omnibus deal very much.
 At issue are the 12 annual spending bills comprising the portion of the government's budget that passes through Congress each year on a bipartisan basis. Whatever approach passes, it’s likely to contain a batch of unfinished leftovers such as extending expiring health care policies and tax provisions and continuing the authorization for the government’s flood insurance program.

 Fr. Kandotharackal feels that crossing over from the Congress to the Left camp does not make him ideologically suspect or give him tough time convincing the electorate during campaigning. “Being loyal to the cause is all that matters,” he said.
 He said that the urge to contribute to society was what prompted him to take the plunge into electoral politics.
 “Every social being has a duty to intervene in societal issues for facilitating social justice and politics offers the best way to strive towards that end. The Left with its pro-poor and secular outlook seems ideal for fighting for the cause of the people,” said Fr. Kandotharackal.

 “We have asked institutions to resume classes in a phased manner. Besides following protocols recommended by the NMC, medical colleges should have a back-up plan to quickly shut down in case of a second wave of infections,” Health Director S. Mohan Kumar said.
 In Puducherry, PIMS and MGMCRI have resumed classes and the rest of the institutions, including IGMCRI and Jipmer in the city and its offshore campus in Karaikal, would follow suit shortly.
 Under NMC guidelines, institutions should be ready with a plan to monitor disinfection measures, safety and health conditions, screen and detect the infected persons, and implement containment measures to prevent the spread of the infection.
 Day scholars should be let in only after their body temperature is checked, sanitisation of hands, wearing of face masks and gloves. Students would undergo a Rapid Antigen Test before classes commence while hostel students would be subjected to RT-PCR test.
 Symptomatic persons should not be permitted to enter the campus and should be advised to contact the nearest hospital for clinical assessment. Regular visits of a counsellor might be arranged so that students could share with the counsellor their anxiety, stress or fear.
 The NMC has stipulated that to avoid the risk of transmission, students, faculty and staff should be screened and symptomatic ones be advised to get clinically assessed before allowing them on the campus.
 Isolation and quarantine facilities should be arranged on campus or at a hospital or approved premises or as advised by the local authorities. Availability of food, water and healthcare should be ensured for those in quarantine and isolation facilities.
 For those who test positive, isolation facilities should be arranged, as advised by the local authorities. The NMC norms include physical distancing of at least 6 feet, mandatory use of face covers or masks, frequent hand washing with soap (for at least 40-60 seconds) even when hands are not visibly dirty, use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers (for at least 20 seconds) and adherence to respiratory etiquettes — the practice of covering one’s mouth and nose while coughing/sneezing with a tissue/handkerchief/flexed elbow and disposing of used tissues properly.
 The NMC advocates self-monitoring of health by all and reporting any illness at the earliest. Spitting is strictly prohibited and installation and use of Aarogya Setu app is advised wherever feasible. There should be no crowding at hostels and in the mess.
 ## Advisory to colleges
 Medical colleges have been advised to plan re-opening in phases in such a way that they ensure social distancing, use of face masks and other protective measures. Thereafter, for didactic lectures, students may be taught via online platforms.
 For all teaching hospitals, at least 30% beds should be allotted to teaching units and necessary precautions taken.
 Students should be instructed to visit their respective departments in small groups for consultation with the faculty members, after seeking prior appointments to avoid crowding while maintaining physical distancing norms and other safety protocols, the NMC said.

Many people think of Denali National Park and Preserve as exclusively a summer haven, but the Alaska Railroad connects passengers to experience this national treasure through a new lens as a winter wonderland. The Aurora Winter Train serves as a guide through the rugged winter landscapes of Alaska, and passengers take in these striking views through large picture windows as the train rumbles through the edge of the park.
 Winter visitors who aren’t content to simply see Denali from the window of the train should consider the Denali in a Day package, offered every Saturday through March 2021. One of many winter travel packages offered by the Alaska Railroad, this guided full-day trip offers the chance to visit Denali in winter.
 With this package, visitors meet their driver mid-morning and begin the journey out of Fairbanks south on the Parks Highway, passing through the river community of Nenana. Don’t forget to keep an eye out for wildlife while on this ride, passengers may get lucky and spot a moose or caribou as they make their way to Denali National Park and Preserve.
 Upon arrival at the gates, many travelers choose to visit the Murie Science and Learning Center before strapping on their snowshoes and exploring nearby trails. Seeing the park’s vast six million acres and rugged landscape covered in a blanket of snow gives a sense of peaceful solitude and a yearning for adventure. On a clear day, the tallest mountain in North America, Denali towers over the park.
 After a few hours of exploring, visitors catch the Aurora Winter Train to head north back to Fairbanks. The winter journey on the Alaska Railroad is unlike any other; gliding through the snowy, untouched wilderness from the comfort of the railcar makes passengers feel like they are in a snow globe.
 With an Adventure Class ticket, local food and drink options are available at the Wilderness Café, and having a warm cup of hot cocoa in hand is a must while on this ride. The railcar warms passengers right up after a day outside in Denali National Park and puts them back in Fairbanks by evening time for a chance to search the skies for the northern lights.
  _The Alaska Railroad has taken extra steps to ensure passenger safety this winter season. Find more information and resources and learn more about the routes and adding on more excursions to a trip atwww.alaskarailroad.com. _

Azar also discussed the government's strategy for messaging, given that polls suggest many Americans are wary of taking a vaccine they believe isn't sufficiently tested.
 "We have got a very large public affairs campaign in the works. I hope we'll be on radio this week and getting on TV soon thereafter to help educate people about these vaccines," Azar said. "One interesting thing: we actually had to go back to the, as we call it, white-boarding on these campaigns, because the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are so highly effective in these clinical trials, we've actually had to make some edits to our campaign materials to take account of that.
 "And then, the most important thing we're doing is we're keeping politics out of the process, and we're making sure that everything is done through those independent checks in the system that you and I have talked about so often."
 Dokoupil asked, "Are they targeted in particular to populations - thinking Black and Brown populations, more vulnerable populations - who are particularly skeptical about something coming through a federal process?"
 "Yeah, there is a targeting there, because as you know there is a very sad and sorry history in connection with some aspects of clinical trial research that have happened in the past," he replied. "That's why we have been so focused, so very focused to ensure significant minority community enrollment in these clinical trials, and the latest Moderna data out today from the full clinical trial demonstrates, I think, 30% of those in the trials were from underserved communities, especially our African-American and Latinx communities. So, we have a very robust population that participated in the studies, and I want to say, as secretary, thank you to everybody who participated in these clinical trials. You really give us hope for the future because of these credible vaccines that now are going to be coming."
 Dokoupil said, "You say you're working on a messaging campaign; wouldn't the time for the messaging campaign have been prior, while you're working on logistics, while you're developing [vaccines]?"
 "Actually, Tony, not," Azar said. "First off, we want to be very sensitive. The other side was complaining if we were to put campaigns out to educate people about the vaccine before the election, there was a lot of concern expressed about that. We held those campaigns back.
 "But also, you want to time it just right. You can't condition a market a month, two months before general vaccine availability. You just won't have the effect, so you want to time it really right in sequence with vaccine availability so that you really have that call to action that will have the maximum effect.
 "The timing," he said, "is right on."
 As of today the United States has had more than 13 million reported cases of the virus. More than 266,000 people have died, with at least one American dying of coronavirus every minute.
 There have been 4.2 million cases diagnosed in November - double the number last month.
 COVID-related hospitalizations in the U.S. are also at their highest point ever - nearly 100,000 - and officials warn it could soon get even worse, with what they're calling a "surge upon a surge" after Thanksgiving.

 # Washington launches statewide COVID-19 notification app
 Rachel La Corte
 Associated Press
 OLYMPIA, Wash. — Washington state on Monday launched a statewide coronavirus exposure app, joining more than a dozen other states that have already enlisted the use of smartphone technology in the ongoing effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 People with iPhones can now enable the ‘exposure notifications’ feature that is already in their phone’s settings, and Android devices can download the app, called Washington Exposure Notifications. Use of the app is voluntary and users can opt out at any time. The statewide expansion comes after a monthlong pilot project used by 3,500 participants — including students, faculty and staff — at the University of Washington.
 “This offers Washingtonians another tool to help control the pandemic,” state Secretary of Health John Wiesman said of the program, which officials are calling WA Notify.
 The technology, created by Apple and Google, is in use in more than 30 countries and more than a dozen states in the U.S., including New York, Colorado and Virginia. Washington was among five states with pilot programs already testing the technology.
 Wiesman cited modeling for King, Snohomish and Pierce Counties done by Oxford, Stanford and Google that predicted significant decreases in both infections and deaths if at least 15% of people use the app. Washington officials are hoping to exceed that 15% threshold.
 The app uses Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus. Phones using WA Notify exchange random codes, which officials said are completely anonymous, with no location tracking or exchange of personal information.
 When someone tests positive for the virus, a health official will ask them if they have WA Notify and will give them a verification code — which is not tied to their identity — to enter into the app. Once entered, the app can determine users who have been near the person who tested positive and notify them of possible exposure. No information about who may have exposed them or where the exposure occurred is included in the notification. The notification will direct people to a website with information on next steps, including how and where to get tested.
 “I think the really important thing we want the public to understand is that WA Notify doesn’t need to know who you are or where you go in order to work,” said Lacy Fehrenbach, the Department of Health’s deputy secretary for COVID response. “The more people that adopt this technology, the more effective it is.”
 The app — which can only be used on smartphones, not tablets — is meant to be used to complement contact tracing that is already being done by the state and local health departments.
 “This is an anonymous supplement to our contact tracing system, it is not a replacement,” Fehrenbach said.
 After a person tests positive for the virus, a contact tracer gets in touch with the person to determine where they have been and who they have been around in order to ensure that close contacts are notified and told to get tested and self-quarantine.
 Officials said that the benefit of the app for is situations where a person who tests positive doesn't know the people they were around, for example on a bus. If others on that bus have the app, they will be notified about the potential exposure within 24 hours of the COVID-positive user entering their verification code into their app.
 The statewide rollout of the technology comes as the state has seen a sustained spike in new cases and hospitalizations.
 As of this week, more than 162,000 cases have been confirmed statewide and there have been 2,703 deaths.
 Nationwide, there have been more than 266,000 virus-related deaths and over 13.3 million confirmed infections.
 Governors have been told that they can expect a first batch of the coronavirus vaccine by mid-December, but officials caution that all of the other tools like masking and social distancing remain important since the majority of the population won't have access to the vaccine until sometime next year.
 “That’s obviously going to be quite a long process before everyone can get vaccinated,” Wiesman said. “But these are the things we can all do now to take care of ourselves.”
 For most, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks, although long-term effects are unknown. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The answer to when reboots and remakes are going to fade off and go away is pretty simple when people stop paying attention to and paying into them, since the only way they manage to get any attention or the kind of patronage that makes them worth bringing up has to do with the number of people that are willing to watch. Head of the Class was a popular show back in the 80s and closed up shop by the early 90s, but it would appear that HBO Max is ready and willing to bring it back with Isabella Gomez as one of the lead actors. How this new venture will track with the audience is hard to say considering that it's not really known if people remember Head of the Class that well considering that it was one of many sitcoms that were popular back in the day. With enough updates and perhaps even a cameo or two by a couple of the original actors, those that are still around and available, it could be that we'll be able to really get into this show. Some folks will anyway, that much is kind of evident, but it does feel as though it might have a lot of proving to do when it comes to whether or not people are going to be convinced that it's worth keeping beyond the first season. With the way that things are going for various shows these days on streaming networks, it's fair to say that if the first season goes well that it might get a second, but anything after that is kind of up in the air.

Moderna Inc. said it will apply to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, as the latest study results confirm the shots offer strong protection.
 This comes a week after Pfizer asked for FDA authorization for its vaccine (developed with its German partner BioNTech).
 On "CBS This Morning" Monday, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, if approved, vaccines could be available in the United States before Christmas, and that it would be governors who decide which segments of the population would be first in line to receive them.
 Azar said that, after Pfizer applied for its Emergency Use Authorization, the FDA announced an advisory committee meeting for December 10. "If everything is on track, everything proves out what it appears to be, we could be looking at approval within days after that," he said. "Moderna is basically one week behind that. And General Perna [the chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed] said that we'll ship within 24 hours of FDA authorization.
 "So, we could be seeing both of these vaccines out and getting into people's arms before Christmas."
 Azar told "CBS This Morning" co-host Tony Dokoupil that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will create recommendations to prioritize vaccine distribution.
 "We have at the CDC something called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and they have been meeting with us to give us advice on whom - based on the data that we've got on these vaccines and the state of the case, the epidemiology around the country - should we vaccinate first," Azar said. "That's ongoing still. I hope this week we'll get greater clarity from them in terms of their recommendations and our CDC director's views. But be thinking people in nursing homes, the most vulnerable; be thinking healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of most interacting with suspected COVID cases, as the first tranches of people that we'll try to get vaccinated."
 "The federal government will ship to the states, and then you said governors will have ultimate authority about who gets the vaccine first," Dokoupil said. "If you see at the federal level certain states where people are jumping the line either because they have money or they have connections, is there something that is going to happen to stop that?"
 "Well, again, we're not going to be shipping vaccines to the states. I do want to be clear about that: We're shipping it through the normal vaccine distribution system," Azar replied. "Our governors are really like air traffic controllers. They're going to tell us which hospital, which pharmacies, where they would like it to go. And they will be determining which groups to be prioritized.
 "I would hope that the science and the evidence will be clear enough that our governors will follow the recommendations that we will make to them, and we'll certainly call out any inequities or injustices that we see in approach, and we'll assess all of our options as we go.
 "I'll be talking to all the nation's governors this afternoon with the vice president," Azar said. "I have a lot of confidence in our governors to do the right thing here."
