COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Big Ten administrators changed a rule so No. 3 Ohio State could play for a Big Ten championship on Saturday, despite only having played five games this season. Now the Buckeyes want to prove they belong there and beat No. 15 Northwestern decisively enough that the College Football Playoff committee will take note. Ohio State is No. 4 in the CFP and would benefit from a big win that could solidify the ranking and put it in a playoff semifinal game on New Year's Day. Ohio State had three games canceled this season due to COVID-19 issues.

 “In the club’s current situation, Messi’s salary is not sustainable, so we’ll have to reach an agreement with him,” said presidential hopeful Emili Rousaud.
 “We will present an attractive project to him.What matters most here is the sporting project. When Messi said he was leaving, he didn’t mention money.

Alessandro Altobelli, a “Il Sogno nel Cuore”. “ _Quello che stiamo vivendo è un bel campionato. Con in testa la squadra che ha giocato meglio. E che, da marzo, ancora non ha perso una partita. Poi seguono le squadre che danno filo da torcere ai rossoneri. La Juve. L’Inter. Con una rosa davvero forte. E che può fare molto di più rispetto a quanto fatto fino ad ora. Ed il Napoli. Con una panchina fatta di tanti titolari. Se gli azzurri avessero giocato a Torino, contro la Juve, avrebbero potuto anche vincere il match. Portando tre punti in più a casa. I nerazzurri non possono incarnare lo spirito interista. Perché sono tutti stranieri. Non sanno cosa vuol dire giocare al Meazza in San Siro. Sono dei professionisti che giocano per la maglia. Ma non la hanno stampata sulla pelle. Conte, nella Juve ed in Inghilterra, ha fatto e ottenuto risultati. Grazie anche alla sua esperienza. E 'un allenatore fatto. E che sa quello che vuole. Per quanto riguarda Rino, sono contento che sia riuscito a dimostrare di non essere solo un ‘Ringhio’. Ma anche un validissimo mister. Quando Gattuso è arrivato, al Napoli c’erano grandissimi problemi. Difficili da superare. Ma è riuscito ad acquisire la fiducia della squadra. I giocatori azzurri lo rispettano moltissimo. Perché sanno di avere a che fare con un uomo leale. Non dimentichiamo che il Napoli ha calciatori che, una volta entrati in campo, cambiano la partita. E questo è merito anche del mister. Lukaku e Mertens? Il primo oggi è uno degli attaccanti più forti al mondo.

FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A federal judge has turned down a Fargo man’s request to be released from prison because of COVID-19 concerns. Robert Scheiring, 54, was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing child pornography. Scheiring believes he’s at high risk for exposure to the virus because of his age and high blood pressure. Scheiring also said that he wants to take care of his elderly father, KVRR-TV reported. However, 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ralph Erickson said that while Scheiring’s blood pressure is considered high, it appears to be well controlled, and his weight is not considered obese. “All in all, Scheiring’s generalized concerns regarding the risk of developing other medical ailments and the risk of contracting COVID-19 while incarcerated fall short of establishing extraordinary and compelling reasons for a sentence reduction” Erickson wrote.

If I believe in consultations, I need to consult about the consultations."

Take it from me, a woman who has been there, and who stayed with her husband for years after his affair because I didn't think I could make it on my own — once you break away and realize what you are worth, you will never settle again. The anger will start to fade a bit as soon as you start to make positive changes for yourself. And this feeling is so much better and healthier than staying with someone who has damaged you in ways you didn't know you could be damaged.
