LAKE TWP. Inside his casket, beneath a spray of white carnations, hydrangeas and snapdragons, Wally Troyer's body lies at the threshold of two open doors at Hartville Conservative Mennonite Church.
   
 It's the same church where Troyer once ministered. The same church down the road from a log home where he and his wife, Wilma, spent half their lives raising three children of their own; three more they'd adopted; and countless foster kids welcomed into their house.
   
 Wally Troyer died Friday. He was 79 years old. He'd been sick for months with the dreaded 'C' word. Not COVID-19. The other one -- cancer.
   
 His calling hours weren't supposed to be like this. But the pandemic has forced families and funeral homes to cancel, delay or adjust services.
   
 And maybe it's a good thing Arnold Funeral Home and his family came up with the idea of a drive-through viewing Tuesday afternoon. Friends drove by in a single-file line, paying respects to Wally then waving to the Troyer family, who'd gathered in five parked vehicles at the end of the line.
   
 "There wouldn't be a parking lot big enough to hold everyone for regular calling hours anyway," said one of his daughters, Tena Ojo.
   
 Wally Troyer seemed to know everyone. Raised Amish, he later became conservative Mennonite. A farmer turned truck driver for Hartville Elevator, he delivered home heating oil to locals for many of his 39 years at the business -- until last summer when he was too ill to continue.
   
 "He wanted to work until he was 80," said son, Tim Troyer.
   
 Funeral directors will tell you calling hours aren't really for the deceased anyway. They are for surviving family and friends. They're an opportunity to confront grief, celebrate a life and to begin adjusting.
   
 Despite Tuesday's unconventional setup, they were a chance to cry, laugh and remember.
   
 Hartville Elevator co-owner Craig Wellspring and driver John Koval parked the same red truck that Wally Troyer drove in front of the church. Soon, it will get a permanent emblem to name it the "Wally."
   
 "He was a friend, teacher and pastor," Wellspring said.
   
 Son Zach Troyer said he always marveled at how much his bearded dad resembled Abraham Lincoln. Tena Ojo recalled how she used to sing songs of faith with her dad. Dave Troyer chuckled at how his wannabe auctioneer dad would hold fake auctions of family animals.
   
 Son Marlin Troyer brought a poem he'd been writing in bits and pieces. In the finished product, "My Father," he recalled how his dad practiced preaching to cows before delivering the same sermon in church; rescued a drunk; loved all his children without reserve; and helped shape the man that the son has become.
   
 "We won't lie ... our family had struggles, but his faith always stuck out," Marlin Troyer said.

This is what isolating with my husband has come to. Nearly 30 years of marriage and we are fighting over dirty dog balls.      "I saw you throwing the ball for the dog outside this morning," I said to my husband. He was making himself some eggs while the dog lay panting on the floor.      "I did!" he said enthusiastically.      "You used the wrong ball," I said, walking past him to pet the panting dog.      "What do you mean?"      "You threw the green ball that has the treats inside," I said. "You're supposed to throw the yellow ball with no treats."      "What are you, the Fetch Police?" he said, as he flipped his omelette.      "No, but when you use the green ball, the treats inside get dirt and dog drool all over them."      He shook his head at me. "I don't understand. Don't the treats get dog drool all over them when the dog eats them?"      "Yes. But this is dirty dog drool."      "Is there such a thing as clean dog drool?" he wondered.      "I'm serious."      "I'm not going to stop using the green ball," he said defiantly. "It has a better bounce than the yellow ball and he likes to catch it on the bounce."      I glared at him.      "BUT THEN YOU HAVE TO WASH IT AND IT RUINS THE TREATS INSIDE!" I bellowed and stormed out of the room. Then I stopped, turned, and yelled over my shoulder. "AND THEY'RE ORGANIC!"      I shouldn't belittle the importance of this topic. The dog's favorite toy is the green rubber ball with the treats inside. When he pushes it across the floor with his nose, the treats will come out of a hole on each end. According to the dog toy people, this is supposed to be very intellectually stimulating for dogs, which would mean at least one member of the family was being intellectually stimulated while the other two-thirds of us were spending our time fighting over dog balls.      The problem was, when my husband threw the green ball outside, it would get filthy and the treats inside would also get filthy. Then he'd wash the ball and the treats inside would then be filthy and also wet, and they wouldn't come out when the dog pushed his ball across the floor. Then I'd have to fish out the dirty, wet treats from a little hole in the ball with my pinky finger and be really annoyed because, clearly, this is the most pressing issue on the planet right now.      The dog seemed completely unbothered by all this fuss. My husband and I, however, found that living together, 24/7, for over a month, was making even the littlest things, like dog balls, fightworthy. We were getting on each other's nerves and this was how it was showing up. It was clear our marriage was going to the dogs.      I stewed in the other room for a while but then realized that we could be stuck together for quite a bit longer and it would be best if we tried to be adults and worked out our ball issues.      "Hey honey, I'm sorry I barked at you about the dog balls," I said as I came back into the room.   "It's stupid. And really, I'm just thankful that with everything that's going on we have each other."      "And I'm thankful for you, too," he said and kissed me. "The dog has a lot to be thankful for, too," said my husband.      "What's that?" I said.      He smiled. "At least he has two balls."

I'm going to take a stab at seeing how much commentary I can get on the top- line expectations here. You guys have a pretty good rule of thumb that net, you generate about $0.10 of cash from operations off of every dollar decline in revenue, which would imply a $200 million of cash from ops, about $2.8 billion of revenue in 2020 and down about 25% for the rest of the year. Given where the comps are, I would say that's probably worse in 2Q and 3Q and better in 4Q. Maybe if you could just comment if that's a reasonable framework for thinking about the way you guys are thinking about the business at the moment.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) is a phenomenon of squeezing light to a tiny volume, causing biomolecules to get trapped across a surface, which in turn enables their study under a microscope. In the recent past, SPRs have been used for drug discovery, material science, and development of biosensors. But now, researchers from the Vanderbilt University have suggested that this tool, also known as lab-on-a-chip, can pave a new way for the detection and diagnosis of cancer, viruses, and other ailments caused by biomolecules, adding whole new revenue avenue for the vendors operating in the surface plasmon resonance market.

Here Jack Cowap, an apprentice with the Welwyn Hatfield Museum Service, reports on the history of milling at Mill Green and how the operation is working today. For centuries the mill at Mill Green has been serving its local community. Now, during the current health crisis, the wheel is continuing to turn in that historical setting with senior miller Alex Popovic at the helm to provide flour for the local community once again. We know that milling has been taking place at the Mill Green site for almost 1,000 years as it is one of the mills owned by the Bishops of Ely at 'Hetfelle', listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. Since then, the mill has continued to change and survived a multitude of challenges; from our millers being fined in the 1400s, feuding with their neighbours, and seeing devastating fires destroy nearby mills in the late-18th century. But since the mill's reopening in 1986, it has been running at a more leisurely pace, teaching new generations about the history of milling and the science involved in getting that freshly baked loaf on to your table. However, as supermarket flour stock is depleting in the face of the coronavirus outbreak, the mill is once again proving its value to bakers. To meet this new demand, the wheel is turning at a pace it would have seen in years gone by with our millers, Alex and Richard, working tirelessly to fulfil orders for local people. Of course, there have been new challenges to overcome that have made us adjust the way that we are working. We are able to continue our milling operation with two millers working together; keeping their distance from each other and wearing face masks throughout the process. We have also been working hard with our staff behind the scenes, taking orders and giving collection times. Our front of house staff have developed a new process of contactless collection, with flour picked up directly from the mill itself, ensuring the safety of both our staff and our customers. We are able to provide locally sourced organic, stoneground wholemeal flour for our customers, which makes for a great taste fresh from the millstones as well as being highly nutritious. Also, while we are unable to host our usual bread making courses, we are more than happy to give advice on baking and offer recipes for soda bread while yeast is still tricky to get hold of. It is also heartening to see so many people learning brand new life skills, as customers tell us that they will be attempting to make their first loaf with our flour or that they will be baking with their children while the schools are closed. It is amazing how many lessons we can teach through baking, from the maths of ratios and measuring weights to the science of types of scales as well as showing where our food actually comes from. We are incredibly proud to be working as a community resource for the Welwyn Hatfield borough and it is great to see our mill continuing to thrive as we write a new chapter in its long history. Flour is available for pre-order from Mill Green Tuesday to Thursday, 10am to 4pm, with collection times being arranged at the point of order. Mill Green will be taking card payments only, with a maximum of 3kg per person (6 loaves) at this time.

“You see, I am a Canadian, who always wanted to play the game built on discipline, teamwork, cohesion and synergy,” added Young, who finished his Friar career on the No. 2 spot in all-time games played (132). “I was determined to soak in the experience of it all, but at the same time my main focus was to make a definitive impact.”
 Young, who hails from Vaughan, Ontario — outside of Toronto — posted career highs for points and rebounds per game at five apiece.
 The Friars’ senior center ranked No. 2 on the team in blocked shots (19) and rebounds (153), having played in all 31 games for PC (19-12), making 19 starts.
 “It was never really about me scoring a thousand points a game,” said the mild-mannered Young. “What meant the most to me was leaving a legacy as a unit, and I was determined to do so.
 “Just being able to put that Friar jersey on and represent all the amazing things it stands for was empowering for me, game after game.”
 Young shot 52 percent from the floor this season, hitting 64 of 123 shots, in addition to having 28 assists and 20 steals.
 “With a bad start (4-4 in November), we were counted out by everyone — I mean everyone,” Young recalled, as PC suffered through a three-game losing streak in one stretch.
 “Friar fans were hopping off the bandwagon left and right, but we were still invested and believed we had much more in the tank,” said Young. “I’ve always remembered times in my life when things just didn’t seem to be going my way.”
 He reached double-figure scoring in just four games, but he had 15 games in which he grabbed five rebounds or more – collecting a career-best 10 against Texas.
 “The bond I was able to build with my brothers was unbreakable because of all the ups and downs,” continued Young. “Playing in front of sold-out crowds (at The Dunk), both home and away, was exhilarating and challenging at times.
 “Those late-night trips, finding patience when we were frustrated, pushing harder in the gym even when we didn’t have it only made the wins at the end sweeter.”

Progress is hampered further by that wailing CVT Lineratronic gearbox, which constantly hunts for the right ratio and just sends revs flailing around under load.
 With a manual gearbox, the Levorg might actually be a bit of fun. With a manual gearbox and a turbo, it could be a hoot. But we're not getting one. A new Levorg is set to be announced at the end of this year, so fingers crossed Subaru UK rediscovers its adventurous side in time.
 Because, truth be told, there's little else to dislike about the Levorg. The interior is great, Subaru's improving them all the time, and even the infotainment screen is better than ever.
 There's plenty of standard kit, which is a blessing given the lack of specification choice, and my test car came with a digital rear-view mirror.
 It's the first time I've used such a device and to say it takes some getting used to would be an understatement. Objects appear overly-close, at first, until you realise you're actually seeing a view of your behind that's completely unobscured by pillars and window frames.
 Persevere, and you might grow to love it. I did. My wife refused to even give it a try though, which is a shame.
 The cost of running a Subaru Levorg might appear, at first, as one of the thorns in its side. A lack of diesel and only a relatively large petrol engine leave you with 32.6mpg on the WLTP combined cycle and 167g/km. But remember, depreciation is usually strong with Subarus and reliability is also a trump card. As a rule.

Ho Van Thuong, deputy head of the district’s Agriculture and Rural Development Office, said the lake management agency has proposed to dredge the lake bed and increase water storage capacity. However, higher authorities are still considering the proposal over concerns that dredging can increase salinity levels and the risk of land erosion.
 "In the long run, we are asking management authorities to continue to purify salinity in the reservoir so the citizens have water to use next dry season," Thuong said.
 The saltwater intrusion and drought has arrived earlier this year and have severely depleted freshwater sources of more than 80,000 households and 43,000 hectares of rice fields in six Mekong Delta provinces: Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Long An, Kien Giang, Ca Mau and Soc Trang. All of them have declared the situation an emergency.
 The government has spent a total of VND530 billion ($22.5 million) for the six provinces as well as two other Mekong Delta provinces of Tra Vinh and Bac Lieu to help them with the crisis.
 Last month, meteorologists warned that the Mekong Delta would suffer salt intrusion at levels much worse than what was experienced in 2016. They had said that salt intrusion will keep escalating between March 6 and 10 before hitting its highest level in the middle of the month before slowly decreasing in April.
 While many experts have blamed climate change and upstream dams on the Mekong River in China and other countries, there is no indication that the situation will improve on this front.
 Some have said that the delta, which is also a major agriculture and aquaculture hub for the country, has to restructure the sector drastically to adjust and adapt to some of the changes that look irreversible.

To my many friends who have made my four years at Penn State so unforgettable and have taken an interest in my time as a writer at the Collegian, I am dearly appreciative. To Connor, my best friend and roommate of four years, with whom I’ve made more stories than anyone, your encouragement has meant more than you’ll know.
 And of course, to my family — and framily — most of all Mom and Dad, your unwavering belief in me and desire for me to succeed in a challenging industry was never lost on me.
 For the time being, I’m going to put the journalism thing on hold. But I won’t ever stop telling stories, even if it’s the same one I’ve told my friends a thousand times.
 Those stories are the soul of humanity.

The increasing cases of targeted security breaches and phishing attacks are by far the leading factor driving the global ransomware protection market. The large ransom demanded by hackers through these attacks is one of the major concerns for organizations worldwide. The information extracted by hackers usually has a huge demand in the black market, which can adversely affect the overall growth of an organization. Moreover, the introduction of crypto- currencies for ransom payments and the growing popularity of ransomware-as-a- service model are working in favor of the growth of the market. On the other end, the presence of free solutions for endpoint security for ransomware is hampering the overall revenue generation of the global ransomware protection market.

Researchers at Kaspersky have discovered a series of spam and phishing attacks aimed at exploiting the Coronavirus pandemic by targeting users who are waiting for packages to be delivered.
 Some of these criminals are posing as delivery service employees claiming that a package has arrived, and to receive it, the target must read or confirm the information in an attached file. Once the attachment is opened, however, malware is downloaded on their devices.
 According to Kaspersky, one example of this is a backdoor called Remcos that when installed on a PC or a phone turns it into a bot, steals data, or downloads additional malware.
 In another scam, bad actors have been creating legitimate looking phishing pages for popular delivery services as a way to get their hands on credentials. Potential targets are encouraged to input details such as their e-mail and password into the Web site in order to track their packages.
 Tatyana Shcherbakova, senior Web content analyst at Kaspersky, says the COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos in industries across the board, including delivery services, so it's no big surprise that attackers would jump on the bandwagon.
 “With people regularly receiving notifications about delivery delays or item shortages and without the option to purchase needed items in stores, these types of scams have a high chance of success,” she adds.
 Although people are eager to receive their orders, she advises caution, adding that it’s important to always carefully assess where these e-mails are coming from and make sure the Web page address is correct.
 Kaspersky experts urge users to never open attachments or click on links in e-mails from delivery services, particularly if the sender insists upon it. Going to the official Web site directly and loggin into an account from there is a more sensible option, they conclude.

The number of Arizonans out of work and seeking benefits hit yet another new record last week as the state economy continues to feel the effects of COVID-19.
 New figures from the state Department of Economic Security show there were 129,215 initial claims for the week ending April 17. That compares with 88,688 the week before, 29,348 the week before that – and fewer than 3,000 at the end of February.
 Michael Wisehart, the agency’s deputy director of employment and relief services, told Capitol Media Services Arizona has to construct a system from scratch for emergency federal unemployment benefits.
 States, like Texas, that have been battered by hurricanes or other disasters have had to set up systems to handle emergency unemployment benefits.
 “They’re able to repurpose infrastructure available to them having had those disasters,’’ Wisehart said. “They are able to be a little bit farther along in this cycle than we are.’’
 Things are different here, Wisehart said.
 “Arizona is unique in that we haven’t had a disaster of this magnitude in the past,’’ he said. “And so, we’re needing to stand this up more from scratch.’’
 The DES has contracted with Geographic Solutions to set up a Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for the state.
 The move comes nearly a month after Congress approved the Coronovirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, the $2.2 trillion stimulus package that created the new PUA program with its benefits of $600 a week.
 DES already has been providing the additional cash to those already are eligible for the regular state benefits of up to $240 a week.
 The federal law also provides that $600 benefit for those who don’t qualify under the state program. But that required DES to develop an entirely new system.

That’s why all three levels of government — federal, state and municipal — must work now on a Plan B in the event that COVID-19 is still threatening our lives and keeping voters away from the polls.
 Because this election MUST go on.
 Before anyone ever heard of coronavirus, the polarization of our nation during the Donald Trump presidency has made the Nov. 6 election a big deal.
 Now, voters want and need to be able to choose the officials who will keep them safe, lead them out of this pandemic and guide the recovery of our wounded nation. And they must be able to exercise their fundamental constitutional right without fear of sickness or even death.
 To do this, in-person voting must be minimized. A recent poll said two-thirds of Americans would be uncomfortable going to a polling place now.
 To make access easier and safer, mail-in voting should be expanded as much as possible.
 Nearly three-quarters of American adults support the government requiring mail-in ballots in November. More than 30 states already conduct their elections entirely by mail or permit “no-excuse” absentee voting.
 The Massachusetts Legislature, working with Secretary of State William Galvin, must quickly approve a law allowing all voters to receive an absentee ballot due to the COVID-19 crisis.

Devon Lawrence, the store’s manager, said the donut-making kits are a way for kids to have the experience of watching a donut be made in front of them without interacting with anyone in person.
 “[The donut-making kits] are actually our best-selling thing right now,” Lawrence said. “Local and small businesses are the ones that are feeling pinched the most, so shopping small and shopping local every day is what we keep telling everybody [to do].”
 Johnson also emphasized the importance of supporting local businesses and said they make Happy Valley what it is.
 “For our local businesses, write a positive online review, share posts, order gift cards or takeout,” Johnson said. “Small acts are just as important as big ones during times like these.”
