News reports from Guatemala were beginning to reveal how disastrous the safe- third-country deal was when COVID-19 began to dominate everyone’s lives. Just like that, on March 20, the head of the CDC, Dr. Robert Redfield, decreed that the border would be shut to all noncitizens. For years, the _Times_ would later report, Miller had been hoping to use the threat of a public health crisis to seal the frontier with Mexico. He finally had one, and he didn’t miss his chance: By locking out virtually all asylum seekers, the administration has kept them out of sight—so much so that news about unaccompanied children being held in hotels pending their rapid expulsion barely cut through the noise. Imagine the depths to which Trump and Miller might sink in a second term.

His blunt delivery in Calexico morphed into a grotesque shtick a day later in Las Vegas, where he addressed the Republican Jewish Coalition at megadonor Sheldon Adelson’s Venetian casino. “The asylum program is a scam,” Trump said. “Some of the roughest people you’ve ever seen—people that look like they should be fighting for the UFC. They read a little page given by lawyers that are all over the place—you know, lawyers. They tell them what to say. You look at this guy and say, ‘Wow, that’s a tough cookie!’” He paused, gesturing like he was reading from a statement and launching into his best big-galoot voice. “‘I…am…very…fearful for my life. I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home.’” He stopped to raise his right index finger. “No, no: _He’ll_ do the accosting.” The crowd laughed, ate it up. “Asylum”—and here he tried out a whiny, bleeding-heart voice—“‘Oh, give him asylum! He’s afraid! He’s afraid! We don’t love the fact that he has tattoos on his face. That’s not a good sign. We don’t love the fact that he’s carrying the flag of Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, only to say he’s petrified to be in his country.’” He stopped again, one more time, and held his arms out wide. “To confront this border crisis, I declared a national emergency.”

Bad News In The Pipeline For BP’s Share Price? | CMC Markets

Barcelona have made a request to the Generalitat de Catalunya to suspend the vote of no confidence on embattled club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, report RAC1 as per Marca.
 It is said that the club sent a letter to Pere Aragones – the acting president of the body – to make the request and it is believed that the outbreak of Covid-19 in th region is being used as an explanation.
 A report in Marca last week outlined that, despite the censure being passed and a vote to go ahead, there is a doubt that such a vote will be held under the current circumstances with cases of the virus going up across the region of Catalonia.
 Gerard Figueras, the General Director of Sports of the Generalitat de Catalunya, had been cited by the report as telling Cadena Ser: “Ten days ago it was said that it could be held, but this issue could be rethought based on the epidemiological conditions that occur on the dates set by the club.”
 The dates of 1 and 2 November for the vote had been confirmed by the club earlier this month, but it now appears this situation may change.
 20,687 votes were gathered for the motion against the supremo, passing the threshold of 16,250 signatures – with that number now matched in terms of verified signatures from the club.
 The position of Bartomeu at Barcelona has come under great scrutiny in recent times following a trophyless campaign combined with Lionel Messi’s attempted forced exit from the club, which the board blocked.
 Last month, Catalan police accused the beleaguered club supremo on corruption charges, although Bartomeu continues to deny such allegations.
 His term as club president will officially end next year with elections called for March, but a group of fans want to force an earlier exit this year, as per Diari Catalunya.
 Bartomeu has held the position for two terms but he will nominate a ‘continuity’ candidate who is close to the incumbent and comes from a side of the club’s board which is viewed as more conservative.
 The Catalan entrepreneur started in the role in 2014, following the resignation of Sandro Rosell – who was his close friend and associate who served as his vice-president.
 All candidates come from different sections within the club’s hierarchy, with differing views on how the club should be run and what it stands for.

BERLIN (AP) — German business confidence has declined for the first time after five straight monthly increases as coronavirus infections rebound across Europe, a closely watched survey showed Monday. The Ifo institute said its monthly confidence index fell to 92.7 points in October from 93.2 in September. It said that companies' view of their current situation improved but their expectations regarding the outlook for the next sixth months worsened. Germany, which has Europe's biggest economy, is widely viewed as having handled the first phase of the pandemic well. Its shutdown in the spring was relatively mild and short compared with those in some other European countries. But Germany hasn't been spared the sharp rises in new infections seen across Europe in recent weeks. Though confirmed new cases have been rising at record rates, they are not yet rising at anywhere near as fast as some other European countries, such as Britain, France and Spain. In light of the virus’ resurgence, new restrictions have been imposed in some parts of the country on everyday life, such as the early closing of bars and added requirements regarding mask-wearing. Ifo's index is based on monthly responses from around 9,000 companies across the economy.

The people of God are a people of protest. Most Christians today don’t think this way. Whatever their political outlook, Christians tend to think that maybe they would support the right kind of protest in a time of emergency, but that these occasions would be rare.
 Rather than seeing protest as an exception to the rule of normal life, Christians in America should see protest as part of our necessary proclamatory action that Jesus is Lord in a world that lives otherwise. We protest people and presidents who disparage the image of God in other human beings. We protest policies and practices that fall short of love of neighbor. We protest systems and patterns that privilege some and exploit others. We protest the politics of a world that killed the author of life and is dead set on killing his disciples.

Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail on Monday hinted at challenging an arbitration order that put a temporary hold on its ₹24,713 crore deal to sell assets to Reliance Industries.
 Future Retail said it wasn’t party to the agreement under which Amazon.com Inc had invoked arbitration proceedings.
 Amazon, which acquired an indirect minority stake in the retail and fashion conglomerate last year, alleged that Future’s sale of its retail, wholesale, logistics and warehousing businesses to Reliance breached its pre-existing contract, which included a right of the first offer and a non-compete clause.
 On Sunday, the Singapore International Arbitration Centre restrained Future Retail and its founders from going ahead with the sale until a final decision is given.
 In a statement, Future Retail Ltd (FRL) said it is “examining” the communication received from the SIAC and the interim order of the Emergency Arbitrator.
 “It may be noted that FRL is not a party to the agreement under which Amazon has invoked arbitration proceedings,” it said.
 “FRL has been legally advised that actions taken by the FRL/ its board, which are in full compliance of the relevant agreements and eminently in the interest of all stakeholders cannot be held back in arbitration proceedings initiated under an agreement to which FRL is not a party.”
 It went on to state that all relevant agreements are governed by Indian law and provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act.
 Stating that the interim arm “raises several fundamental jurisdictional issues which go to the root of the matter,” the firm said the order will have to be tested under the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act in an appropriate forum.
 “In any enforcement proceedings, FRL would take appropriate steps to ensure that the proposed transaction will proceed unhindered without any delay,” it said without giving details.
 Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL), a unit of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd, in a statement on Sunday evening stated that it had “entered into the transaction for the acquisition of assets and business of Future Retail Ltd under proper legal advice and the rights and obligations are fully enforceable under Indian Law.”
 “RRVL intends to enforce its rights and complete the transaction in terms of the scheme and agreement with Future group without any delay,” it had said.
 Online retail giant Amazon had last year acquired a 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd, the promoter entity which owns a 7.3% interest in Future Retail, the operator of more than 1,500 stores in India including grocery chain Big Bazaar.
 Amazon’s investment in Future Group came with contractual rights that include a right of first refusal and a non-compete-like pact. Also, the deal came with the right to buy into their flagship, Future Retail, after a period of between 3 and 10 years.
 Commenting on the SIAC interim order, Sweta Patodia, Analyst, Corporate Finance Group, Moody’s Investors Service, said: “SIAC’s decision to put a stay on the sale of Future Group’s consumer business to RIL is unlikely to impact the latter’s credit profile, given its position as the leading retailer in India and it’s strong financial position. Nonetheless, the decision will likely delay RIL’s plans to expand its retail footprint in India.”
 The Future deal would have almost doubled Reliance’s footprint.
 In a statement issued late on Sunday, Amazon said it got all the relief it sought, without providing specifics.
 “We welcome the award of the Emergency Arbitrator,” the U.S. e-commerce giant had said. “We remain committed to an expeditious conclusion of the arbitration process.”
 Amazon, Reliance and Walmart Inc’s Flipkart are in a battle to gain market share in India, where millions of middle-class customers are newly adopting online purchases of food and groceries due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 The booming e-commerce market in the country will be worth $86 billion by 2024, according to research firm Forrester.
 The stakes are particularly high for Amazon, which believes India is a big growth market after shutting its online store in China last year.
 The oil-to-telecom conglomerate Reliance has since September 9, sold an 8.48% stake in its retail unit to investors such as Silver Lake, KKR and Mubadala for ₹37,710 crore to expand its so-called new commerce venture, which uses neighborhood stores for online deliveries of groceries, apparel and electronics.
 The firm, whose retail operations already runs close to 12,000 stores, is looking to dislodge Amazon and Flipkart, which together control about 70% of the online market in India.
 In the interim arbitration award, a single-judge Bench of V K Rajah had barred Future Retail from taking any step to dispose of or encumber its assets or issuing any securities to secure any funding from a restricted party.
 A three-member arbitration panel, where one judge each would be appointed by Future and Amazon and a third neutral judge would preside, would decide on the issue in 90-days.

Over the last 23 years of growing GM crops, the technology has been responsible for the additional global production of 278 million tonnes of soybeans, 498 million tonnes of corn and 32.6 million tonnes of cotton lint, among other crops — without additional use of land. That’s remarkable by all standards. This technology can be developed locally to meet regional needs and deal with challenges unique to the continent. Before the next COVID-19 hits, let’s be aware that a boost in productivity is crucial to ensuring that something will be available for consumption. It is morally imperative for African leaders to prioritize the food security of their people over the interest of special interest groups and allow GM crops to be grown on the continent.

It has been a very active hurricane season, and it could be record setting for Louisiana. Zeta is forecast to reach the state at or near hurricane strength Wednesday -- and if it does, it will set the record for most named storms in the state in one season.
 It would be the fifth, following Cristobal, Laura, Marco, and Delta. Zeta would also bring Louisiana to tie with Florida in 2005 as the most landfalls in any state in one season.
 "This storm is expected to make landfall somewhere on the Gulf Coast by midweek, meaning we have a few days to prepare. As we've seen this hurricane season, a tropical threat during the ongoing COVID-19 emergency is challenging, but something we can handle," Edwards said in a tweet.
 As of early Monday morning, Zeta was still about 250 miles southeast of Cozumel, Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph and moving at 2 mph.
 The storm is predicted to strengthen to a hurricane Tuesday before downgrading again, but if that happens, experts warn, that doesn't mean it won't wreak havoc.

 Lest anyone forget, the cororavirus is giving Massachusetts a not-so-gentle reminder that it never really left.
 Boston was the latest community to pull back on in-person learning, as Hub schools went completely remote with transmission of the coronavirus continuing to increase in the city.
 Boston's exit from the classroom earned the city a mention on the presidential debate stage Thursday night where President Donald Trump continued to insist the country had turned a corner in its fight against the virus. Gov. Charlie Baker hasn't gone that far -- and doesn't agree with the president on much these days -- but on the issue of schools the two Republicans seem to be reading from the same page.
 Baker said he wouldn't "Monday morning quarterback" Mayor Marty Walsh's decision for Boston, but said again that it's not schools where the virus is spreading. Instead, the governor continued to blame social gatherings, primarily of 19- to 39-year-olds, where masks are not being worn and distancing not observed.
 It's not all retreat
 In Massachusetts, the daily new case count almost reached 1,000 on Thursday and the seven-day weighted average positive test rate ticked up to 1.5% as 77 cities and towns are now in the state's highest-risk "red" category.
 In MetroWest, Ashland joined Framingham, Marlborough, Milford, Holliston, Hudson and Southborough as a red community.
 On Thursday night, the Department of Public Health decided to shut down ice skating rinks due to clusters of infections the state has observed linked to hockey games, practices and tournaments.
 The state, however, is far from being in retreat.
 In fact, Baker this week called attention to what his administration described as an ongoing $775 million economic stimulus program that included $115 million in just available funding, the highlight of which was a new $50.8 million grant program for hard hit small businesses.
 "To be clear, there's no substitute for the size and scope that a federal aid package could deliver. But that doesn't seem to be in the offing and we certainly don't believe that we can wait," Baker said
 Other things red
 With less than two weeks until voting ends in Massachusetts, more than a quarter of the state's 4.6 million registered voters have already cast their ballots. Of the 1.3 million votes cast, almost 890,000 have been by mail, with the rest of the voters turning up in person since early voting opened on Oct. 17.
 So for a good chunk of the electorate, Baker was too late when he endorsed Republican Kevin O'Connor in the Dover attorney's longshot race against U.S. Sen. Edward Markey. In a hand-held cellphone video, Baker said O'Connor would bring "feet-on-the-ground" representation to Washington.
 But the O'Connor endorsement was perhaps more notable for the fact that Baker chose to back another Republican for Senate, along with Susan Collins of Maine. If O'Connor were to win, the odds of the GOP retaining control of the U.S. Senate increase greatly, although it can't be assumed that's what Baker wants, even if he is trying to shore up his right flank.
 The governor has been frustrated with both parties in Washington, but particularly his own. He has criticized Congress' inability to get a stimulus deal done, and disagrees with the decision of Republicans to press forward with the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court.
 And, of course, he is not voting for President Donald Trump for re-election.
 Meet the chief
 Framingham Mayor Yvonne Spicer is moderating a Zoom meeting at 5 p.m. Monday in which the community is invited to learn more about the two finalists for police chief.
 One is surely a familiar face -- Deputy Police Chief Lester Baker, who's been on the force since 2003. And the other might be, at least for some. He's James Rhoden Jr., major/commander of the Baltimore Police Department -- the same James Rhoden who was selected to replace Thomas O'Loughlin as Milford's police chief earlier this year.
 Rhoden declined the offer, saying it was best for his family to remain in Baltimore.
 For Monday's Zoom session, each candidate will be given equal time to provide an overview of his vision for the Framingham Police Department and answer questions from the community.
 To participate in Monday's Zoom session, visit framinghamma.gov/calendar.
 Those who cannot attend but have questions are asked to email kmcfalls@framinghamma.gov with the subject line: "October 26, Framingham Police Chief Candidate Zoom." A recording of the meeting will be provided to everybody who emails a question(s).

Forty-eight percent of voters in the poll said they believe that schools and local governments need extra revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, an argument made by some Proposition 15 supporters. And 40% of undecided voters agreed, at some level, with that sentiment.
 DiCamillo said Propositions 15 and 22 should not be written off, as voters inundated with news about the pandemic and the presidential contest have only now focused on ballot measures.
 “I don’t think the past rules of thumb are necessarily as important this time,” he said about the two propositions. “Whatever decision voters make on these measures, it probably will not be by a large margin.”
 The hill to climb is much steeper for Proposition 16, favored by fewer than 4 in 10 likely voters, which seeks to reinstate affirmative action programs in California. Placed on the ballot by the Legislature, it would repeal Proposition 209, a 1996 measure approved by voters prohibiting government bodies, including the UC and California State University systems, from granting preferential treatment to any individual or group based on race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin. Proposition 16 would allow affirmative action efforts in public college admissions and government employment and contracting decisions.

Families can play large-scale games of Checkers, Tic-Taco-Toe, Connect Four and other games or future cowboys and cowgirls can try their hand at roping dummy steers or playing a round of horseshoes. There’s also a petting zoo for those wanting to get up close and personal with farm life. If you’re willing to get a little dirty, you can even excavate an area and to for prizes in an archaeological dig.
 Brianna Gaither, a teacher at Davidson public schools, was one of several leading a field trip to the patch and said the annual trek to the farm was something the students looked forward to every year.
 “I love the fact that it’s local,” Gaither said. "It’s kinda help put our town on the map, but It’s also an outdoor activity that we get to go to that the children really enjoy. We don’t even need the school busses because (the Woffords) come pick us up for a hayride here and back to school.”
 The Wofford’s call it a pumpkin patch, but that's not really all it is. Wofford said. The corn maze is the biggest attraction, especially Saturday nights when the maze opens from 7 p.m. to midnight for a haunted tour through rows of corn that would make Stephen King shudder.
 "We have a five-acre corn maze, which is haunted Friday and Saturday nights," Wofford said. “It can be as scary as you want it. If you have children, then we’ll let the volunteers know to tone it down; if you’re looking to get scared then we can handle that too.”
 The Woffords, including their two daughters, spend much of the offseason leading up to opening expanding and improving the facilities and games, and an area where parents can sit and watch their children play. This year, they also added handwashing and sanitation areas to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
 "When parents come out here, they can sit anywhere and see just about everything their children are doing here," Wofford said. "We designed it that way so that the parents can watch as the children have fun and play games. And I tell you, I hardly see anyone pull out their phones while they're out here. It's all about having fun."
 The Red River Pumpkin Patch has three pricing options — good, better and best ¯ each with their own benefits. The good option doesn't include the hayride or archaeological dig, while other packages include those and other options. Every package comes with a pumpkin to take home.
 The patch is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and from 1-6 p.m. Sunday. The haunted corn maze is open from 7-10 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Wofford said anyone interested in bringing a large group out can contact him at (580) 339-6315 for more information.
 For larger groups, Wofford suggests they contact him, and they can arrange a discount.
 "We have group rates available,” Wofford said. “They can get with us if they have 15 or more and we'll set something up for that group."

Trump’s attack on asylum has only intensified. On July 16, 2019, the administration announced it was banning virtually all non-Mexicans who arrived at the southern border from applying for asylum. A more limited kind of protection is available, but unlike asylum, it can never result in a green card or citizenship. Later that year, the White House rolled out two more programs that speed up the screening process, prompting several Democratic members of Congress to complain that they “appear designed to deny asylum- seekers access to counsel while rushing vulnerable families fleeing persecution through life-or-death legal screenings behind closed doors.”

Whatever the iteration, a revival of the CCC would simultaneously tackle the problems of environmental degradation and economic doom.

"If you actually take a broader definition of unemployment and count people who are making below a living wage, we're talking about 25 percent unemployment right now in the US, for people that are either out of a job, have a job part time, or are getting paid poverty-level wages," says Paul. "We can actually put folks to work, provide them with not only a means to make a living, but also with an ability to contribute to their communities in ways that benefit not just them, but the community writ large—and in this case, the environment as well."

California, MO) -- A fugitive in Moniteau County is back in custody after turning himself in Friday. Thirty-six-year-old Christopher Wayne Winter had been arrested for attempted kidnapping. Authorities say he cut off his G-P-S ankle bracelet last Wednesday. They say he did that after trying to kidnap a woman at the Eagles Club in California. Winter was wearing the ankle bracelet while he was free and waiting for another pending court case. He turned himself in to a bondsman after spending just over a day on the run.

EIN News/ -- OTTAWA and EDMONTON, Alberta, Oct. 26, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, the leadership of the new organization formed through the amalgamation of the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI) and Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement (CFHI) was announced. Ronald Guse and Dr. Lynn Stevenson are Co-Chairs of the Board of Directors, Jennifer Zelmer is President and CEO, and the senior leadership team was also unveiled.  
 "As health systems across the country and around the world grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, forming this new organization with an expanded capacity to support safe, high-quality healthcare and a more coordinated and patient- partnered care comes at a critical time," says Board Co-Chair Ronald Guse. "Under the thoughtful and strategic leadership of Jennifer Zelmer and her team, I have no doubt this organization will rise to the challenge."
 "We have a tremendous opportunity to achieve a shared vision of safe, high quality healthcare for all," agrees Board Co-Chair Dr. Lynn Stevenson. "I can think of no better time than the start of Canadian Patient Safety Week to introduce our new team who will harness the strengths of both organizations to improve healthcare with, and for, more people."
 The new organization will be fully introduced in the coming months, along with opportunities for stakeholders to partner to improve quality and safety. Until the organization completes the next steps in the amalgamation journey, it will continue to operate as CPSI and CFHI.
 "I am honoured and excited to be chosen to lead this new pan-Canadian organization with an expanded capacity and uncompromising focus on raising the bar for quality and safety in healthcare," says Jennifer Zelmer. "At this pivotal time, my promise to everyone committed to better healthcare is to work with you to deliver measurable, widespread and lasting improvement."
 A transition Board of Directors for the amalgamated organization has been named - with equal representation from both CPSI and CFHI boards - and the senior leadership team has also been selected (see backgrounder for biographies).
 In engaging with stakeholders across the country to explore their priorities and how the amalgamated organization can support them, some common themes have begun to emerge:

In May of that year, an ocean liner named the _St. Louis_ left Hamburg en route to Havana. On board were more than 900 German Jews with Cuban visas, many of whom hoped to head on to the United States. When the Cuban government ordered the ship to leave its waters, it headed to the eastern coast of Florida, followed by a Coast Guard patrol boat. The captain cabled authorities in the United States and Canada for permission to land, to no avail. The _St. Louis_ headed back across the Atlantic with what the _New York Times_ called “her cargo of despair.” (A year later, Roosevelt would tell the press, “Now, of course, the refugee has got to be checked out because, unfortunately, among the refugees there are some spies.”) In the end, the governments of Great Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands agreed to take the passengers in.
