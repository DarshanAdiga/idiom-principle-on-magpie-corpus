We see a lot of success stories, especially from the training kitchen, but we've had to postpone everything because of an abrupt ending of our lease. We've been based in the same building for 10 years and, with no explanation, we were given notice from our landlord, to quit the premises at the very beginning of the pandemic. We continued to work because we're a frontline service and we never close our doors. We remained one of the only services that people could drop in to see a member of staff face to face. We built safety screens, our staff wore PPE, we held repeated COVID-19 safety training, and within the whole period we had no coronavirus cases within our team.
 We see up to 90 people per day who need food, emotional support, benefits support, and to access our pharmacy service.
 We asked for the notice to quit to be paused and also for an extension to the lease to give us some time to find new premises, but it was months before we could actually view anywhere because of lockdown.
 Then, we managed to negotiate a new lease but the landlord changed the terms on the Friday it was due to be signed on 30/10/20. We couldn’t accept the new terms, because it would have jeopardised our status as a charity, our funding and our future going forward.

LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said he's only experiencing “mild head congestion” since he was diagnosed with COVID-19 late last week. The Democratic governor said in a statement Monday that he appreciates the support and well wishes and wanted to thank health officials who have been helping him since his test for the coronavirus came back positive on Friday. The 66-year-old governor is isolating at the Governor’s Mansion in Carson City and is receiving daily monitoring by local health officials and check-ins from a local physician while continuing to work remotely with his staff and cabinet, his office said. “My focus remains on addressing the record surge the State is currently experiencing and my administration continues to work around the clock to serve Nevadans through this ongoing pandemic,” Sisolak said. Sisolak on Friday announced he received an initial positive result from a rapid test. He said Monday that a more sensitive-laboratory test also yielded a positive result. The governor's office did not immediately respond to questions Monday about whether the governor or his doctors know how Sisolak contracted COVID-19 and whether anyone else in his office has tested positive. The governor has not been in his Carson City office since Thursday and staff members who have been considered close contacts are quarantining. Sisolak is the third person in his office to test positive for the virus. Two weeks ago, the governor’s office announced an unnamed Carson City-based staffer who had not been in close contact with Sisolak but had tested positive for the virus. In early October, Sisolak’s COVID-19 response director Caleb Cage also tested positive. The governor's diagnosis comes as Nevada is seeing a spike in coronavirus cases. The...

Travers has a long and decorated association with Ballyboden, and his elevation should pave the way for a relatively seamless transition, as he was part of Fortune&rsquo;s outgoing management team.Joining him in the new backroom team will be former Dublin hurler David Curtin, who hung up his Boden boots this autumn at the age of 40, and Antrim native Micky McCullough, who was team coach for their 2018 county title success and again for this year&rsquo;s campaign which culminated in final defeat to Cuala. Curtin will serve as selector while McCullough remains on as coach.Travers came off the bench in the 2018 final, Fortune&rsquo;s first year in charge, to win an incredible seventh Dublin SHC medal with his adopted club. The high point of his Wexford career came in 2004 when he featured at corner-back on the team that shocked Kilkenny in the Leinster semi-final before vanquishing Offaly in the provincial decider.All three members of the new management team have played prominent roles in the club&rsquo;s hurling success story which is told in the forthcoming &lsquo;History of Ballyboden St Enda&rsquo;s GAA, Camogie, Ladies Football and Handball Club 1969-2019&rsquo;, written by club member Gerry O'Sullivan.

SHIMLA On the heels of the festive season, the health department has mooted a proposal to ban public gatherings and cap guests at marriage ceremonies and social functions to mitigate the spurt in Covid cases across the state. Covid cases in Himachal have been increasing at an alarming rate after the government unlocked all activities, reopened schools and relaxed restrictions on social gatherings.

The state had detected 7,083 cases in October and 8,938 cases in September.Authorities say lax precautions at marriage ceremonies was one of the prime reasons for sudden spurt cases across the state. Marriage ceremonies have emerged as hotspots for infections in Mandi, Kullu and Shimla district. In Shimla district, the apple belt, comprising Kotgarh, Kumarsain, Jubbal- Kotkhai, Rohru and Rampur, was most affected. Last month, the state government had increased the guest limit in social gatherings from 100 to 200. Shimla, Mandi and Kullu districts have seen the maximum rise in infections. Shimla recorded the highest number of cases (1,812) during this period,registering a spike of 72%.

There are more than 4,000 positive cases per million population. Lahual-spiti, where residents have barred tourism to prevent the spread of Covid, has also witnessed a steep increase with122 cases reported in a single- day on November 15.The opening of schools had further accelerated the spread of Covid. The government had opened schools and other education institutions on November 2. However, in light of the spike of cases closed all educational institutions till November 25.The decision drew flak from the Opposition parties, which charged the government of mishandling the pandemic. The health department has also sent a proposal to the government asking them to curb social gathering. "We have forwarded a proposal to the government asking them to curb social gatherings," said a senior health official, requesting anonymity. "The government should set up a committee of experts otherwise the situation will become graver. It is high time that the government re-works its strategy and curbs social gatherings",said former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan.

The tip of the streak in one image will line up with the end of the tail in the next image, contributing to this speculation from the scientists.

If you scanned the field during Sunday's fifth consecutive Miami win, you often saw players repeatedly bypassed in the draft -- or cut loose by other teams -- making plays for the Dolphins.
 And that has been one of the encouraging hallmarks of this new regime.
 At running back, there was Salvon Ahmed -- claimed off waivers from San Francisco in August -- rushing 21 times for 85 yards in his first NFL start. Keep in mind that the Chargers tried to poach Ahmed from the Dolphins' practice squad in September, and Miami showed the sense to immediately move him to the 53-man roster, identifying a talent that it didn't want to lose.
 Ahmed was so impressive that Miami parted ways with veteran Jordan Howard on Monday.
 At receiver, there was rookie seventh-round pick Malcolm Perry displaying his speed and shiftiness and catching two passes for 21 yards and reversing field for an impressive six-yard run while logging a career-high 23 offensive snaps.

Airborne dust even factors into the amount of solar radiation bombarding the Martian surface. On Earth, our atmosphere, along with our planet's magnetic field, shields us from radiation. But there is no global magnetic field at Mars, and its atmosphere is just 1% the density of Earth's. So measuring dust and radiation go hand in hand, especially for spacesuit design.

The upsurge in the production of vehicles with reduced noise pollution, low maintenance, and safety, among others has led to tremendous increase in demand for electric scooters. As the prices of fuel are at an all-time high, the demand for electric scooters will increase further. Electric scooters do not release toxic gases or smoke, which are dangerous to the environment as well as human health. To recharge electric scooters, renewable energy is used, which can help in the reduction of greenhouse gases emitted from the usage of fuel in vehicles. Thus, improved safety of electric scooter will lead to tremendous upsurge in the demand for electric scooters in the market globally.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — A woman who sat on the Breonna Taylor grand jury says she believes their investigation was incomplete. She spoke to The Associated Press. She says she believes prosecutors wanted to give police “a slap on the wrist.” She is the third grand juror to speak anonymously about the proceedings in September that led to no charges being filed in Taylor's killing. Taylor was shot to death in March during a narcotics raid in Louisville. The grand juror says she believes the officers should have faced charges. She said she came forward because she wanted Taylor's family to know she didn't support the findings.

We try to remove barriers for anybody who wants to have an opportunity that are generally not easy to access for those individuals - so people can come into our training kitchen on a work placement, where they'll get a high level of support and a mentor by our head chef.
 They learn all aspects of kitchen work, so that they're employable when they leave. It's about structure, it's about teamwork, and for a lot of people it's about friendship, because some people we work with, find it hard to build friendships, as a result of their situation.
 The Marie Trust was founded in 2009 and I've worked with them for 10 years. I took over the role of Chief Officer 18 months ago. We have only 15 members of staff, with mine. being the only management role, we're not a big organisation.
 A lot of people who we work with have been so socially excluded for such a long period of time, they've got multiple, complex needs, so a lot of our work is intense crisis support, but also a lot of our work is to support people in the long term. Our aim and purpose is very much to exit people out of homelessness - people shouldn't have to stay in this situation, they should be able to move on with their lives.
 We also have an education programme, working in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College and City of Glasgow College, and have done so for a number of years.
 The important thing about that aspect of our service, is that people don't always want to come back to a homeless environment like our centre and moving on to being in a college environment really helps them in their recovery and rehabilitation, because it helps them with their sense of identity.
 It gives them a college card - they're the same student as anyone else - they have the same access to facilities, and also, it's a new beginning for people. We’ve always provided that service as a route to exit homelessness.

BEIRUT (AP) — Kurdish-led authorities Monday released dozens of Syrian families from one of the largest camps in northeastern Syria holding tens of thousands of women and children, many of them linked to the Islamic State group. The release of 120 families comes a month after senior Kurdish officials said all 25,000 Syrian nationals in the sprawling al-Hol camp will be allowed to leave as part of a general amnesty to ease pressure on authorities maintaining the camp. The release, announced through the Kurdish- led Syrian Democratic Council, is voluntary. Unlike previous releases it doesn't require sponsorship agreements with local Arab tribes to which those detained belong. Only identification papers are needed, according to the SDC. The camp is also home to about 30,000 Iraqis, most of them children, and 10,000 additional foreign nationals. The camp's population mushroomed after Kurdish-led forces transported families of IS fighters and supporters of the group who had remained holed up in the last territories IS held in Syria. The military campaign ended in March 2019, with thousands transferred to the camp, including many foreigners. Those released Monday are from Deir el-Zor province, a majority Arab province that has seen protests against the Kurdish- led administration. The Rojava Information Center, a media group that covers Kurdish-administered territories, said 17,000 of the 25,000 Syrians in the camp are children. Sheikmous Ahmed, a Kurdish administration official in charge of displaced, said the Monday release is the first in a series. Ilham Ahmed, a senior Kurdish official, said last month that running the camp has become a financial and security burden on the Kurdish-led administration. She said foreign nationals would be returned to their countries of...

Soon after Moderna released news of its promising early data on Monday morning, President Donald Trump took credit on Twitter, saying that the vaccine developments "all took place on my watch!"
 While Moderna did take research and development funding from the Trump administration and worked under National Institutes of Health oversight, Pfizer developed its vaccine independently, although it took an upfront payment of $1.95 billion for future delivery of vaccines under Operation Warp Speed. Some experts with whom CNN spoke said last week the Trump administration's purchase guarantee may have contributed to the speed with which Pfizer arrived at its promising early results, which the company announced last week, though they could not say with certainty how much influence the administration had.
 Sebelius said that in addition to the President and his administration, it is incumbent upon the United States Senate to aid in the Covid-19 response.
 "The Senate has the keys to the castle right now," Sebelius said Monday.
 "The Senate could actually pass a bill that gives Americans some confidence that they would have economic support, get the extra $600 in unemployment benefits running again, make sure that people understand that they could feed their kids and pay their rent if we have in some areas of the country to restrict activities. And they have the ability to step up to their president and say, 'You need to act differently, you must acknowledge the election and conduct a smooth transition,'" she said. "So, I really don't want to let (Senate Majority Leader) Mitch McConnell off the hook."

I'm embarrassed to say that I've never read a real Walt Simonson comic over my many years of collecting, aside from the odd fill-in spot on New Avengers or whatever. His idiosyncratic, angular style is immediately apparent. I also had this sense from reading later runs such as Kieron Gillen's Journey into Mystery, Jason Aaron's Thor, and even the MCU Thor films and getting the sense that I was missing something without having read Simonson's foundation that they were all clearly borrowing from. It was like reading the Daredevil runs by Bendis and Ed Brubaker without understanding why they spent so much time on Gladiator before realizing they were chewing from the same apple as Miller, but this time with Surtur of Muspelheim.
