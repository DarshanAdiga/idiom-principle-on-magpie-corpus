GOP playing games in Kansas primary
 This effort to pass an anti-abortion amendment for the Kansas Constitution is nothing but a political stunt. The GOP has no other motivation than to juice up voter turnout for the U. S. Senate race. It's not saving babies that the GOP wants to accomplish. It's a political cheap shot.
 The KRP did the exact same thing for Sam Brownback in his first run for governor. The put a gun rights question on the ballot in 2010. That stunt guaranteed a huge voter turnout and swept Brownback into the governor's office.
 They're doing it again. Don't be fooled into believing that saving babies from abortion is the goal. It's not. They're using this to win in another race. So, saving babies is just the message that gets people to the polls.
 As it has always been and always will be, anti-abortion is only a means to an end. It is not an altruistic goal in itself for Republicans.

BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Parliament on Wednesday is set to overwhelmingly approve the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union — the final major decision in the four-year Brexit saga. With only two days to spare, the legislators will vote to approve the withdrawal agreement that will end the 47-year membership of Britain. At the same time, the vote will cut the 73 U.K. parliamentarians from the 751-seat legislature where die- hard Brexiteers have been a disruptive force for years while others steadfastly sought to build a more united Europe. “We’ve achieved our goal,\" said British member of the European Parliament Nigel Farage who has campaigned for Brexit for two decades, leaving with a smile and a sense of accomplishment. Preliminary votes in committees have already shown that the exit should be approved by a massive margin. For many though, the first departure of an EU member after the group had grown from an initial six to 28 remains a body blow. ”It’s an incredible sad and painful moment,\" S&D socialist Tiemo Woelken said. “We’ll wait for your return to our European family.\" In a solemn moment, European Parliament President David Sassoli will thank the U.K. members for their cooperation from inside the EU. There still is a final session the British legislators can attend on Thursday, but then they have to vacate their offices. Now, everything moves to negotiations on how to cooperate in the future. Britain seeks to have a full trade deal within the next 11 months and want a transitional period during which they will still abide by EU rules and regulations to be as short as possible. The EU has said such a timespan is far too short to have any kind of comprehensive deal and fears remain that a chaotic exit, averted this week,...

America's priciest home is finally getting its finishing touches.Seven years after he started working on "The One", a 100,000-square- foot mansion in Bel-Air, movie producer turned developer Nile Niami says he's just about ready to test the market with his ballyhooed $500 million asking price.Replete with a nightclub, four swimming pools, bowling alley and 360-degree vistas of sun-dappled Southern California,  the symbol of America's latest gilded age has generated a flood of media coverage since the proposed price was announced in 2015.And while permitting problems, construction delays and financing issues have exposed the struggles of building luxury homes on speculation, and raised questions about whether the project high above Los Angeles would ever be finished, Niami says he's almost done.  And he's not backing off the lofty price tag, which would make the house the most expensive in America."When you have something that's as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want for it," Niami said in an interview, arguing that recent nine-figure property property deals in Los Angeles and elsewhere are proof that his pricing strategy was not just about generating press. "When the house was started, I had no basis to ask $500 million-- now there are so many triple-digit sales in L.A. and the world that the asking price is not unreasonable anymore."Niami admits the pressure of his development odyssey has aged him prematurely.  Building mega-mansions without a buyer lined up can be precarious. Cost overruns and delays are common, carrying costs are high, and shifting appetites for luxury are hard to predict. And while a project as eye- popping as The One grabs headlines, the amenities and specific design can ultimately narrow the pool of potential buyers, said appraiser Jonathan Miller, president of the real estate appraisal and consulting firm Miller Samuel Inc."The problem is, the more amenities you add, the more you personalize the property,'' Miller said. "Even though the intention is to draw eyeballs to the property, you are also personalizing it, which may reduce the size of the market pie. It's a very small, very tight market."Niami says that's not a problem. Los Angeles has tried to limit  the construction of new mega-mansions, meaning nothing like The One can be built again, the developer said. And while one amenity that got a lot of attention -- a room with tanks of live jellyfish lining the walls -- has been dropped because it was too much work, Niami said he's got something planned that's  "even better.''He hasn't yet let anyone inside the property, but says the special features have helped draw interest from potential buyers. He's talking to them now, but declined to provide details, citing privacy issues. The One's unveiling will happen once the final interior decorating is done, Niami said."I've had potential buyers a long time on this,'' Niami said. "We have a list of very real, verifiable buyers that we will bring in soon."Pricing homes above their market value, a strategy known as "aspirational pricing," is a way for a developer to get attention for ultra-luxury listings.  A sale at the half-billion-dollar asking price would be more than double the biggest residential real estate deal in the U.S. to date -- a $238  million penthouse purchased by Citadel founder Ken Griffin in Manhattan. Niami points out that Griffin's place is an apartment, with no land, while The One sits on 3 acres."The Billionaire," another Bel-Air spec house that briefly was the most-expensive home for sale in America, was originally listed by developer Bruce Makowsky for $250 million. The 38,000-square-foot mansion, with wine cellars, pools, a bowling alley, helipad and "candy room," sold for $94 million in October, a 62% price cut.A Los Angeles native raised by a single mother who was  a special education teacher, Niami started out as a makeup artist in the move industry.  He eventually became a producer and his credits include "The Patriot," starring Steven Seagal, and "Point Blank," with Mickey Rourke. His turn to real estate came when he began remodeling condos. Niami has two additional multimillion-dollar projects in Bel-Air. On a neighboring hillside, another of his properties, 10701 Bellagio Road, took three price cuts after being listed in 2018 for $65 million. A notice of intent to revoke permits on that property, and on another $65 million Niami-owned mansion directly behind it, were issued by the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety."When you have something as rare as the Mona Lisa, you can command whatever you want"Without those permits, the properties can't be legally occupied.  After several meetings, the issues are close to being resolved, according to a spokesman for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. Still, the properties have been taken off the market, he said.That leaves The One. Niami took out a two-year $82.5 million loan from Hankey Capital, which specializes in high-interest bridge financing, to help finish the construction. He's current on the debt payments and faces an October deadline to repay the money, according to Hankey. Niami declined to comment on the rate of his loan.While very few super-luxury homes sell each year, there was an uptick in 2019. Last year, 23 homes went for $50 million or more in the U.S., the most since 2014, according to Miller. Six of those sold for at least $100 million."The One is absolutely no issue," Niami said.  "The value is definitely there."

TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Nearly halfway into a 10-year pledge to combat the toxic algae that turns Lake Erie a ghastly shade of green, Ohio has made little progress. Its patchwork of mostly voluntary efforts hasn't slowed the farm fertilizers that feed algae blooms, leading to contaminated drinking water and dead fish. Ohio's governor has authorized an ambitious plan that this year will begin offering farmers financial incentives to adopt new agriculture practices and will create a network of wetlands to capture and filter runoff from fields. The broad approach is being watched closely by states struggling with an increasing number of algae outbreaks. Some environmental groups are skeptical, but others that have been at odds with the farming industry are hopeful. While there are no guarantees the strategy will revive the shallowest of the Great Lakes, there are potential pitfalls, including a lawsuit calling for tougher regulations, that could upend the state's goal of drastically reducing nutrient pollution entering the lake's western end by 2025. “We can’t move forward as a state unless we preserve Lake Erie,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said when he announced plans to pay farmers to voluntarily participate, part of $172 million targeted for water quality. One of the biggest hurdles is that the state must convince farmers to make changes without any certainty they will be enough. And no matter how many get on board, progress will be slow because phosphorus from chemical fertilizer and manure has built up for years. Backers of the state's plan worry that farmers could get discouraged and lawmakers may back away from committing more money if algae blooms continue to overwhelm the lake. That's why the state's immediate focus is on convincing farmers in the western Lake Erie region to commit to some changes. \"Our...

The banks of Farmington and Ipava State bank have agreed to share ATMs; yet they will remain two separate banks; Bank of Farmington and Ipava State Bank have announced a long-term agreement allowing customers of both banks to use ATMs interchangeably, without fees.
 The 'customer first' decision will give customers of Bank of Farmington and Ipava State Bank access to a total of thirteen ATMs spreading throughout nine communities.
 "Oftentimes, you see competition between local banks," said Joe Dietz, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ipava State Bank.
 "But here, you have two community-minded banks coming together, focusing on what is going to be best for their customers. No merger, no buy-out... just two separate banks agreeing to work together." "Very simply, this decision is about giving customers access to their money at more locations.
 "Between both banks, our ATMs are spread out across a wide area," added Higgs, President, Bank of Farmington.

Dear Dave,
 We're debt-free except for our home, and we'll have our fully-funded emergency fund of three to six months of expenses, we've agreed on six months' worth, saved up by the end of February. We're also setting aside a little each month to buy a newer car with cash later. We're about $5,000 from our car fund goal, but my husband is getting impatient. He wants us to go ahead and finance the remainder since it's a relatively small amount. He has tried to justify this by mentioning that you don't seem to have a problem with people borrowing money to buy a house. Could you explain the difference?
 Lana
 Dear Lana,
 Okay, first things first. I don't like debt of any kind. I don't really like borrowing for a house, but I'm not unreasonable. I tolerate mortgage loans, as long as people use a 15-year, fixed-rate mortgage, with payments that are no more than a fourth of their monthly take-home pay. A house is often the largest purchase in a person's life, and one most people can't achieve based solely on saving. I still recommend, however, setting aside as much as possible for a down payment before taking out a mortgage.
 Here's the thing. Cars go down in value, while traditional homes generally increase in value substantially over the years. Plus, you can get a great, pre-owned car for $10,000 to $15,000. This is an amount which, in my mind, is doable over the course of several months through determined saving and living on a budget. Depending on where you live, a good home can cost 10 to 20 times that much.
 The best way to build wealth and have a secure financial life is to stay away from debt. This means getting out of mortgage debt as quickly as possible, too. You're never going to win with money if you can't learn to delay pleasure.
 Everyone has that little kid inside them, and that little kid wants everything he or she wants right now. Your husband is asking a normal question, but he's dangerously close to letting that immature little kid out. It happens to all of us once in a while, but we have to grow to a point as adults where we tell that little kid no!
