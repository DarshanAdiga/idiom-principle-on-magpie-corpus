Burk expressed gratitude for Give MN’s annual Give to the Max fundraising drive, saying it’s been “paramount in our success” every year. BENCHS plans to use the funding to upgrade its pet kitchen, where medications, cat food and dog food are stored.          Last year BENCHS used donations to upgrade its surgical suite, and both projects are part of plans to update the building to accommodate the greater number of animals coming through. Much has changed on that front in the last 12 years BENCHS has been in the building on North River Drive in Mankato.          “Our volume has grown as a shelter, having an average of 1,200 to 1,300 animals per year,” Burk said. “Back then, we were running 500 to 600.”          Having tangible projects in mind when doing donor outreach helps, he said. Donors can then come in and see what their dollars went toward and how it’s benefiting the animals.          Donations for general operations, of course, are also needed at nonprofits and BENCHS happily accepts them. Those funds help cover regular bills.          “Every time I talk to people I can’t say thank you enough,” Burk said. “That’s the biggest message I’ve had, that we could not do this without the support of the Mankato and Greater Mankato community.”          Give MN Executive Director Jake Blumberg said before Give to the Max Day that the organization already had raised more funds for nonprofits in the first nine months of this year than in any previous year. The organization has since reported a new record sum for donations on Give to the Max Day.          About 6,100 nonprofits across the state raised $30.4 million during the online fundraiser, up from $21.6 million the year before.          “If there’s one bright spot in 2020, it would be how people have stepped up and generously donated in record amounts every time we’ve asked,” Blumberg said in a release. “We saw that trend continue through Give to the Max Day, which will provide a boost to nonprofits and schools who are meeting tremendous need in communities across Minnesota.”

MOSCOW, Nov 27 (Reuters) - National carrier Aeroflot should consider sacking the head of its budget airline after one of its passenger planes appeared to trace a phallic-like route in the sky during a commercial flight, Russia's state aviation authority has recommended.
 A commission for the Rosaviatsia authority said in a report that the crew of a Moscow-Yekaterinburg flight operated by Pobeda deviated from its authorised flight path on Nov. 11 for manoeuvres with 102 passengers on board.
 Russian media have cast the manoeuvres as a gesture of public support for soccer star Artyom Dzyuba who had been dropped from the Russian national team after the leak of a private, intimate video featuring a man similar to him.
 Pobeda and Aeroflot did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
 Part of the Rosaviatsia report was published on an anonymous channel on the Telegram messenger service on Friday and a source in the aviation authority confirmed its authenticity to Reuters. The RBC media outlet also cited a source confirming it.
 The commission said the plane had not needed to deviate from its path for security reasons.
 Rosaviatsia declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the report, describing it as internal correspondence. (Reporting by Gleb Stolyarov; writing by Tom Balmforth; editing by William Maclean)

Donations received on the actual Give to the Max Day on Nov. 19 were eligible for bonuses, although donors can contribute to nonprofits anytime before or after as well.          BENCHS Executive Director Andrew Burk said the organization’s official fundraising total was at $47,670 as of Wednesday morning, and he was confident remaining donations would push it over the top.          “We couldn’t do this without the love and support of the community,” he said. “With everything that’s happened this year, we were talking about the $50,000 goal and hoping we could get it — and we’re just flabbergasted we’ll be able to.”          It’s been an especially challenging year for nonprofits. The COVID-19 pandemic forced many to cancel or scale down traditional fundraisers.          BENCHS usually has a wine-tasting fundraiser with a silent auction. The silent auction was switched to online, but the wine tasting had to be canceled.          Other public events like pups on the patio and tails and treats also had to be canceled, while a 5K was switched to virtual. All of the changes made for a more difficult year to raise funds.

MANKATO — A familiar local nonprofit made it onto the regional leaderboard for most funds raised on Give to the Max Day.          The Blue Earth Nicollet County Humane Society, or BENCHS, had the eighth most donations on the day among nonprofits in Give MN’s southeastern Minnesota region. The region includes Rochester and Winona along with the Mankato area.          For BENCHS, which emphasizes Give to the Max Day every year, donations on the day and others still rolling in are pushing the nonprofit closer to its $50,000 fundraising goal.

State Senator-elect Ben Gilmore said, “I think you have to be careful not to get in a slippery slope earth well it might just be temporary but we're still restricting first amendment rights and so I think we have to air on the side protecting our constitutional liberties.”

"Yes, it's a product, it's a decoration that you put in your home, but getting a real tree involves the choosing, the hunting for it, the family outing. It really is a memory maker, it's a day you spend together, and it really becomes much bigger than the tree itself," Gray said. "It's really making family memories and people really seem to gravitate to that right now."                     The growing interest in real trees comes after the industry has struggled to attract new, younger customers in recent years as more Americans buy artificial trees.                     Between 75% and 80% of Americans who have a Christmas tree now have an artificial one, and the $1 billion market for fake trees has been growing by about 4% a year -- despite them being reusable.                      No one tracks annual sales of real trees because independent tree lots are so scattered, but those in the business estimate about 20 million trees or more are sold each year, most of them at big box stores such as Costco and Home Depot.                      Oregon, the nation's No. 1 supplier of fresh-cut trees, expects to ship nearly 6 million evergreens this season to places as far away as Japan and China. Other top tree exporters are Washington state, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.                     The fresh-cut tree industry in 2018 launched a social media campaign called "It's Christmas. Keep It Real!" to attract young families and media-savvy millennials.                      This year, the Christmas Tree Promotion Board also asked Rob Kenney, creator of the "Dad, How Do I?" YouTube channel, to make an instructional video for newbies on how to shop for and put up a real tree, then keep it alive. It's gotten tens of thousands of views.                     "We want to introduce real Christmas trees to young families and new buyers and create greater demand among those people who say, 'I'm a little nervous about just taking a tree and dragging it into my house,'" Gray said.                     It appears that message is breaking through as Americans seek a happier way to close out a difficult year.                     Lee Farms, a sixth-generation family farm in Tualatin, Oregon, opened for the season a week earlier than last year. It sold more than 100 trees in the first four hours and was seeing new faces at a business that normally welcomes the same customers each year.                      "It's almost a new -- or a renewed -- experience for a lot of families this year," said Teagan Milera, co-owner of Lee Farms. "Having that real tree smells so good in your house, something to take care of and decorate together, that nothing beats that for the holiday season."                                                      *[FT]: Financial Times
