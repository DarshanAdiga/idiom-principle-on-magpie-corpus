Candidate Trump launched his presidential campaign by castigating Mexican immigrants in brash, xenophobic terms. "They're bringing drugs," he said. "They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." With those few words, Ronald Reagan's optimistic and inclusive vision of immigration, famously describing America as "the shining city upon a hill," began to disintegrate.
   
 Sadly, it has become acceptable among some on the far left to label Republicans as racists, but name calling of that sort is reckless and rarely leads to constructive change. I remain convinced, however, that if I were a racist seeking political party affiliation, I would expect a warmer welcome from the GOP.
   
 Exploiting racial polarization to win elections is a strategy that did not begin with Donald Trump, but he does it particularly well. From the border wall, to family separation, to voter suppression, Trump rarely misses an opportunity to remind the 90 percent white GOP membership that a multi-racial democracy will result in American carnage. And he is not alone. Mitch McConnell's refusal to consider legislation that would protect the nation's electoral infrastructure from hacking and foreign interference confirmed that GOP leaders are no longer interested in our constitutionally guaranteed right to participate in fair and open elections.
   
 The GOP's apparent quest for a majority white republic is also undermining the U.S. military, violating yet another conservative core value -- that of national security. By refusing citizenship for immigrants in the armed services, and threatening to deport their families, racial and ethnic minorities no longer comprise 40 percent of active-duty military. After the Army missed their recruiting goal in 2018, expectations had to be further reduced for 2019, and the downward trajectory of immigrant recruitment continues this year.
   
 Although most economic discussions around immigration policy focus on agriculture, technological and scientific innovation have also taken a hit. In 2015, far more of Silicon Valley's brainpower originated outside the U.S. and international students comprised almost 12 percent of enrollment in American universities. The January 2017 Muslim Ban -- that massive unforced error by the Trump Administration, but supported by GOP leaders -- changed all that. The resulting brain drain may reduce American commercial competitiveness for years to come because other Western nations have not been so short-sighted.
   
 Joe Biden's candidacy, representing a serious threat to the populist messaging that worked so well in 2016, has forced Trump to adopt increasingly divisive tactics. Unfortunately for the GOP, his brazen expressions of racism and xenophobia are widely rejected by most of the American electorate.
   
 Tragically, if party leadership does not soon wake up, the Party of Lincoln may become largely irrelevant. As GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham noted in 2012, "We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term."

“Jamal may get bored there because they don’t use their safety-type things in all the different complexities of maybe not showing what they are doing as much as what we do,’’ Williams said.
 Indeed, the Seahawks are known for the simplicity of their defense, especially during the Legion of Boom heyday when Seattle’s philosophy was basically that it had 11 players it could line up in the same spot on every down and dare you to figure out a way to beat them.
 Seattle’s secondary has long been known for its use of the Cover 3 defense, meaning three defensive backs each playing zone in a third of the field.
 Recall that Earl Thomas made a similar comment a year ago after he was a few months into his career in Baltimore.
 “This defense is very complex compared to what we did in Seattle where we just ran Cover 3 all the time,’’ Thomas said.
 In an Associated Press story in 2018, former Seahawks player and coach Marquand Manuel (who worked under Carroll from 2012-14) perfectly encapsulated the philosophy of the Carroll defense, which has been heavily replicated by teams with former Carroll assistants the last few years such as Atlanta, Jacksonville and the Chargers.

When Kamala Harris attacked Joe Biden for opposing federally mandated busing in the 1970s, holding herself up as the beneficiary of a school integration program as a little girl, she created a political rift, but not a substantive one, between two Democratic candidates for president.
 Harris and Biden both today support using tools that fall short of federal mandates to try to desegregate schools, despite the stubborn persistence of schools and school systems that in many cases can still be called separate and unequal.
 Instead, they want to give local districts grants to reevaluate their residential zones and develop programs to attract students from outside those zones. That’s the politically cautious and pragmatic course, and perhaps the wise one, but it’s hardly radical.
 I for one hope either a reporter or the Trump campaign revisits the busing rift and attempts to drive a wedge in the perceived Biden-Harris divide, because the sitting president has tried his darndest to set back even cautious attempts to mix Americans by racial and ethnic background.
 Trump is apoplectic about the fact that Biden wants to bring back an Obama-era rule called Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which his administration has summarily rescinded. The rule tells jurisdictions that receive federal housing funds that they have to assess what patterns of housing discrimination they have — and then develop plans to diminish them.
 Modest. Moderate. But at least doing something more than pay lip service to the fact that America remains painfully divided along racial lines, in no small part because government, over generations, wanted to keep it that way.

This is dangerous because in order to take summer classes students need more time and money to do so. This causes our college to become enrollment-based meaning that students have to pay out of pocket cash rather than the flat rate tuition payment which is made possible by financial aid. As a result, students who depend on financial aid are not able to take advantage of summer sessions whereas other students, who can afford to pay out of pocket without  assistance from financial aid,  can.

Wayne Feuerhelm Bridgewater - Wayne Theodore Feuerhelm, 81, of Bridgewater, S.D. passed away on August 10, 2020 at Auberge Memory Care in Scottsdale, AZ. Wayne, the youngest child of Ernestine and Lee Feuerhelm, was born in Sioux Falls, S.D. November 27, 1938. He was baptized October 1, 1939 at Riverside Methodist Church, rural Canistota, S.D. Wayne grew up on a farm with his parents and older sister, Ileane, south of Canistota, S.D. until he was three years old, when the family moved to a farm north of Bridgewater, where he continued living throughout his adult years. Wayne graduated from Bridgewater High School and married Beverly Jorgenson November 26, 1954. They raised four children on their farm in South Dakota. In 2007, they moved from the farm to Bridgewater as they neared retirement. Many winters were spent in Arizona visiting children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. Wayne loved spending time with his precious grandchildren and great grandchildren. As a member of Zion Lutheran Church in Bridgewater, Wayne served on the church council for several years. In addition, he served on the Emery Township Board, McCook County and State Extension Boards, Bridgewater Rural Fire District and Bridgewater Farmers Union Board. Wayne enjoyed hunting, fishing, camping and in general just being out in nature with his family and friends. In particular, Wayne loved animals especially dogs, there was always a special dog or two on the farm which he showered with affection. Preceding Wayne in death were his parents Lee and Ernestine, sister Ileane Ellwein, oldest son Glenn, and sister in-law Diane Wilson. Wayne is survived by his wife Beverly, son Kent (Keyla) San Jose, Costa Rica, daughter Karla (Marcey) Tucson, AZ, daughter Cheryl (Patrick) Kruse, Phoenix, AZ. Grandchildren Sonja (Fernando) Hernandez, Benjamin (Annemarie) Kruse, Allison (Douglas) Houvener, Grant (Melissa) Adams, Daniel Feuerhelm, Brock Kruse, Carter Feuerhelm, Samuel Adams and Kent James Feuerhelm.

Or will they, and maybe break some from precedence?
 General manager John Schneider hinted that the Seahawks may be more flexible in how they use Adams than maybe how they were in the Legion of Boom days, when one reason for not moving guys around some was that they had basically the best player at each spot already.
 “Adding a guy like Jamal who has that versatility to play down in the box and play in the hole and play man coverage is really important to us,’’ Schneider said recently in an interview with Peter King of NBC Sports.
 The Seahawks also showed a little more variety last year, unveiling more six- defensive back packages than in years past, though that also seemed maybe a concession to issues with personnel at some spots and needing more bells and whistles to try to make up for it -- something that compelled a trade for player like Adams, but also something the Seahawks may hope adding Adams will decrease the need for.

City leaders circled the topic of safety Wednesday when considering adding a third roundabout on the edge of downtown and removing certain traffic signals on Poplar Street.
 After almost an hourlong question-and-answer session, the Walla Walla City Council unanimously approved the removal of traffic signals at First, Third and Fourth avenues on Poplar Street and the addition of a small roundabout at the intersection of Palouse and Poplar streets — all part of the $7.6 million multi-phase corridor improvements planned for Alder and Poplar streets, starting in 2021.
 Prior to the vote, the changes were met by many concerned residents through emailed public comments to the Council, some questioning the safety for pedestrians and asking if this could lead to higher traffic volume on Palouse street, which was already deemed a busier street than usual.
 Some residents on Palouse street disapproved of the plan or requested Council to consider further measures to reduce the through traffic coming onto the street.
 City staff will bring the issue back to Council in October to possibly add a few stop signs to calm the already existing high traffic on Palouse Street and look into doing a study for the long term.
 Consultants gave examples of some of the safety features in the corridor reconstruction project, such as curb extensions at most intersections, which help keep speeds down. The extensions improve visibility so that pedestrians and drivers see each other.
 Poplar would be a through-street for eastbound and westbound traffic. The selected traffic signals will be replaced with stop signs at those intersections for northbound and southbound traffic, plus pedestrian crossings with rectangular flashing beacons operated with push buttons, and additional signage and striping.
 The changes will be made to the previously approved Poplar Corridor Study from February 2019, which analyzed traffic patterns and developed recommendations for the roadway configuration.
 Roundabouts, previously approved, will be at Palouse and Alder streets and Park where Poplar and Alder streets diverge.
 Poplar Street, already slated to be a three-lane configuration, will have a section in each direction and a two-way turn lane from the Alder and Park streets intersection to Myra Road.
 Reducing two travel lanes in each direction to one should bring a 3-5% reduction in travel speeds, Scott Mansur, a consultant on the project from DKS said.
 Traffic counts were collected in June 2018 and resemble usual traffic patterns.
 He said they don’t see traffic volumes changing on Poplar Street. There was a lot more capacity for at least 20 years to bring the two lanes in each direction to one.
 He said three lanes show a 30% reduction in crashes mainly from adding bike lanes and a center turn lane. Distance for pedestrians to cross will also reduce.
 The project includes buffered bike lanes, parking where width allows and wider sidewalks, according to city documents.
 Roundabout curvature results in lower speeds in the 15-25 mph range and reduces the points where vehicles and pedestrians converge.
 Roundabouts also increase the visibility of pedestrians and narrow their crossing distance, Mansur said at a Council work session on the matter Monday.
 “Every recommendation in this study in the corridor plan is all about multimodal safety, and we haven’t really put any mode ahead of another,” Mansur said. “This was the No. 1 corridor for the city of Walla Walla for fatal and serious injury crashes.”
 Some wondered if the roundabout at the Poplar and Palouse streets intersection would ultimately drive more traffic down Palouse.
 But after analysis that compared a new signal with a roundabout at the intersection, Mansur said it’s not likely.
 “I don’t believe there will be a significant diversion of traffic using Palouse,” he said.
 Mansur recommended traffic counts before the project and afterward to determine if there are increased traffic volumes. If so, a study and recommendations for calming traffic could be done.
 The city plans to invest in the corridor reconstruction over the next four years, primarily with funds from the Transportation Benefit District and Infrastructure Repair and Replacement Programs, according to city documents.
 A grant application is currently in the works to submit to the Transportation Improvement Board on Friday, which earlier recommended the roundabout on the Palouse and Poplar streets intersection.
 “Three of the best safety tools in the toolbox are roundabouts, RRFB’s (Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons) … and going from four lanes to three lanes,” Mansur said.
 “Those are three of the highest benefit improvements that you can do, and we’ve got all three included in this grant, so I think that’s going to make it very competitive.”
 In a Council report, staff said the estimated cost savings for installing a roundabout instead of a signal is $100,000.
 Removal of the traffic signals at First, Third and Fourth avenues is expected to save $750,000 from the project costs.
