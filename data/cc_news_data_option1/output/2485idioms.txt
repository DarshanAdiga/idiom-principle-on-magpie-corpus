If Beyond Meat continues along this pricing path, margins are likely to be lower down the road. And my concern is about recouping investment in the long term. Today, the company is focused on innovation and has been increasing research and development spending from quarter to quarter; gaining and maintaining high sales volume could help it recover those expenditures. But with so many rivals at the plant-based meat table, I'm not so sure Beyond Meat, whose shares have gained more than 100% so far this year, can assure its place at the top of the menu well into the future.

How you decide to diversify your portfolio depends on a few different factors, including your age and risk tolerance. Younger investors may want a more aggressive asset allocation, while those closer to retirement may want to be more conservative. A general rule of thumb for asset allocation is your stock allocation should be your age minus 100. So, if you're 25, you should have 75% stock funds and 25% in bond or money market funds. If you're 50, it should be split 50/50. This is a general guideline, as some people may work longer and want to be slightly more aggressive in their 50s.

Lunches had to be delivered to the dressing room (sometimes from the fish and chip shop down the road when the prospect of another sweaty salad was rejected).

How to break the uncomfortable silence that accompanies an early departure from the crease? “Bad luck” was somehow not so appropriate after the batsman, who was probably keeping you out of the team, had advanced down the pitch and swung wildly before hearing the death rattle.

Dick Williams, president of baseball operations for the Cincinnati Reds, said MLB is going to charter jets to bring in players from the Dominican Republic, and that teams are allowed to play a small number of exhibition games in July — although he said he doubts anybody will.
 All of these issues could become moot if there’s a major outbreak of the virus within baseball. Avila said one player and one staff member for the Tigers tested positive, and there have been examples from other teams as well. Gardenhire, who has dealt with cancer and diabetes, has concerns about the virus, and Baker, the manager of the Astros, is 71, putting him in a category of older people who could be particularly vulnerable.
 “I’m a bit nervous,” he said. “I’ve seen the reports in Houston how COVID’s going up so I’m going to have to really be careful. I’ve got about 100 different masks. I’ve got some gloves. I’ve read all the reports on what to do and how to stay good. So in my mind and in my heart I’m in good shape and I’m ready to go.”
 Even at age 29, Tigers left-hander Matthew Boyd considers himself at risk because he’s had asthma his whole life — but he thinks he and his teammates will act responsibly. It will be unusual following new safety protocols that are at times incompatible with human nature on the baseball field.
 “It’s going to be different not giving guys big hugs and high fives and stuff,” Boyd said. “Emotion’s going to take over. The second that we hit a walk-off home run, everybody’s probably going to jump out and be like, ‘Oh yeah, wait. Hold up.’”
 There’s been no decision on whether fans can attend games at some point. Commissioner Rob Manfred said the first order of business is getting comfortable with games in empty stadiums. Crane, who owns the Astros, is hoping that could change eventually.
 “We’ve still got to go through the player protocol. They’re very focused on that and the staff that’s going to be associated with the games once we fire up,” Crane said. “I think the intent at some point is to get the fans in the ballpark.”

War Tampa is set to play House of ’Paign on July 4 on ESPN or ESPN2 in the first round of the single-elimination The Basketball Tournament.
 House of ’Paign boasts itself as an Illinois alumni team which embraces its connection to campus in Champaign, Ill.
 As Tampa 20/20, Moschella’s team only picked up one win in TBT in the past two years, but as the field was being selected for this year’s tournament, War Tampa boasted some of the best fan support on social media of any applicant team. Wednesday, War Tampa had far and away the most fans registered as ‘supporters’ on TBT’s website, with the site listing 1,416 registered supporters ahead of second-place Carmen’s Crew which has 853. Carmen’s Crew, made of Ohio State alums, happens to be one of the tournament’s favorites and is its No. 1 overall seed, and it happens to await the winner of 17th-seeded War Tampa and 16th-seeded House of ’Paign in the second round — but War Tampa has more online support than even that team, or any other, and that couldn’t have been ignored as TBT drew its field.
 It’s easy to see why Auburn fans are excited, hopeful to see orange and blue and some familiar faces back on the court for the first time since the virus’ spread. The same goes for basketball-starved fans around the country who haven’t had much to watch since March Madness was canceled and the NBA was put on pause.
 “You know everyone this year is going to be watching,” Moschella said. “This year in particular, this is probably the best exposure for any of these guys that they’ll probably get this year.”
 Brown and Spencer were senior leaders on Auburn’s magic run to the Final Four last year. Murray played at Auburn during the 2017-18 season after Smith played at Auburn during the 2016-17 season.
 TBT is scheduled to run July 4-14 in a quarantine bubble in Columbus, Ohio under strict coronavirus testing. Moschella said on Tuesday personnel and players got in-home testing kits this week that were to be sent back for testing on Wednesday. If all War Tampa personnel test clear, they plan to travel to Ohio on Sunday and be tested again on Monday. During their stay they’ll be confined to a hotel with others who have been cleared by testing.
 TBT has announced that War Tampa’s game will be the third game of the day on July 4 and that all games will be televised on ESPN or ESPN2, but final tipoff times and channel information have yet to be announced.

There’s a well-known phenomenon in the police world called the “blue code” or the “blue wall of silence.” A tacit agreement between cops not to narc on each other’s crimes and misconduct, it exists to insulate them from the same laws they claim to enforce, allowing them to act with impunity under the guise of society’s protectors. If questioned about a colleague’s corruption, brutality or abuse at home, it’s code to claim ignorance. If a cop does speak up or step in, they’re often ostracized or threatened by other officers. In some cases, they’re even fired when they try to do the right thing.

Moreover, if a report is made and followed up on, it usually goes nowhere. Most cops get off with little more than a slap on the wrist — if that — and many are never acknowledged as having hurt someone at all. “In 2018, an independent panel found that the typical penalty for New York City police officers found guilty of domestic violence — some had punched, kicked, choked or threatened their victims with guns — was 30 lost vacation days,” writes Rachel Aviv for the _New Yorker_. “In nearly a third of cases, the officers already had a domestic-violence incident — and, in one case, eight — in their records. In the Puerto Rico Police Department, 98 police officers were arrested for domestic violence between 2007 and 2010; three of them had shot and killed their wives. Only eight were fired.”

 Officials on Thursday announced the opening of five new coronavirus testing centers in Guetersloh, where the slaughterhouse is located.
 Sven-Georg Adenauer, the head of the regional administration, said authorities want to be able to conduct 10,000 tests per day, free of charge.
 The service is expected to be widely used as some regions of Germany have said they'll only allow people from the two districts to visit if they can provide proof of a negative test. Authorities warned those seeking a test to expect long waiting times, and urged them to bring sunscreen and water.
 So far, there is little sign of widespread community transmission, officials say.
 Overall, Germany has confirmed more than 193,000 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, and 8,936 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

For the last three years, his team has played a few prize-money tournaments in Florida every summer, with trips to the nationwide The Basketball Tournament being highlights in 2018 and 2019. This year, two regulars, LaRon Smith and Desean Murray, suggested inviting a couple more players from Auburn, Bryce Brown and Horace Spencer — and with them came a flock of loyal Auburn fans and plenty of excitement. The team went with it, switching its name from Tampa 20/20 to War Tampa to welcome the support.
 It was a fortunate thing, too, after TBT cut its field down from 64 teams in 2019 to just 24 in quarantine in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic.
 That fan support may well have saved the team’s spot on the bracket, in a year where those spots are as hard to come by as ever.
 “When LaRon and Desean brought up the idea of Horace and Bryce, it was a no- brainer — and then, the Auburn fans were fantastic,” Moschella said this week as the team gears up for its planned trip to the in-quarantine tournament in Ohio. “My original plan, I’m not going to lie to you, was keeping it Tampa 20/20 and maybe just changing the colors to orange and blue, but with me and TBT discussing it, it was a no-brainer to switch it to War Tampa.
 “And then the fans blew it up and I think honestly it was a great help for us getting selected into this top 24.”

I am so grateful to my two new mates Katryna and Simon, who informed me about this adventure, and we decided to do the 21km (half marathon) challenge. The race kicked off at 10am which gave us plenty of time to drive from Melbourne to the starting point, where we collected our bibs. It was a cold Sunday morning and I realised that the temperature was even lower than expected, by seeing a km long queue to take a leak at the few temporary portable toilets set up for the event. While Simon and I decided to relieve ourselves in the bushes as we couldn’t wait for that long, Kat (Katryna) patiently waited in the queue and finally her turn came very close to the starting time of the race. In fact, the organizers of the race delayed the start for another 10 minutes, observing the queue of people waiting to relieve themselves.

“The dispatcher told me, ‘We are not going in there, there is nothing we can do. We can come meet you on the outside, but if it’s not life-threatening, there’s nothing we can do.’”
 He said days later, he saw it happen again.
 “I saw the same guy who had broken earlier,“” he said. “He was wearing different clothes, but he locked eyes on me, he saw me and started working toward me, so I ran inside, and called 911 again,” he said.
 Once again, Ploszaj said his call to 911 was futile. Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said Monday her officers would only respond inside the protest zone for cases of life-safety emergencies, for the safety of SPD officers, and protesters calling for de-policing within the zone.
 “We are just sitting ducks all day,” Ploszaj said. “Now every criminal in the city knows they can come into this area and they can do anything they want as long as it isn’t life-threatening, and the police won’t come in to do anything about it.”
 Ploszaj said he has also seen protesters policing themselves.
 “Someone had broken into the East Precinct, and other protesters were shouting at them, and they went in there,” he said. “They forcibly removed (the intruders). They got them out of there.”
 Ploszaj said he and other Pine Street residents tried appealing to CHOP organizers, explaining that many are seniors.
 “We try to bring up our points, but we just get shouted down,” he said. “We just get booed.”
 On Tuesday morning, SDOT workers moved barricades and borders in the protest zone to accommodate traffic and emergency vehicles, while protecting protesters from incoming vehicles.
 “The city has successfully worked with protesters onsite to reconfigure the CHOP to allow for public safety and better access for the local community,” said a release from Mayor Jenny Durkan. “It has involved rerouting traffic, freeing up alley access, opened streets, and replacing makeshift barriers with heavy concrete barriers that can be painted.”
 “This change is going to open traffic back up to over 1,000 residents on 12th Street, and that’s really important to us. And it’s important to keep our protesters safe,” said a protester who says he helps provide security for CHOP. He asked to be identified as Cove.
 Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins, who has been on scene at the protest nearly every day since Seattle police left the east precinct, was there again Tuesday.
 He said some protesters were worried someone else would drive into the crowds there, so the Seattle Department of Transportation was removing plastic barricades and relocating some concrete ones, which would help provide safety.
 The changes also improve access for emergency vehicles as well as deliveries for businesses, and for residents’ vehicles.
 Cove said they are showing they are not an “autonomous zone” and can work with the city of Seattle. SDOT, Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle firefighters were all at the scene working Tuesday.
 “We are not a right-wing or left-wing radical faction. We are members of the community and that’s it. I think being in sync with public utility and the fire chief is really going to go a long way to show that,” Cove said.

DETROIT (AP) — Ron Gardenhire and Dusty Baker are a little uneasy. Jim Crane hopes his Houston Astros can play in front of fans at some point.
 As baseball scrambles to start an abbreviated season, the prevailing mood is one of nervous excitement.
 “Is it a risk? Absolutely,” said Gardenhire, the 62-year-old manager of the Detroit Tigers. “There’s risk involved in this. We all know it, and we’re willing to go try to do this thing. I would never want to jump ship with my team, but we’re going to hopefully do everything right as far as protocol goes, and take care of each other and keep everybody healthy as best we possibly can.”
 Major League Baseball set a 60-game schedule Tuesday night, and now the sport will try its best to complete a season and crown a champion amid a coronavirus pandemic that still looms over much of American life. Players report to camps July 1 — hard to call it “spring training” at this time of year — and the regular season is supposed to start about three weeks later.
 It already feels like a whirlwind.
 “We knew this was a possibility so I think everybody is kind of ahead of where they normally would be for traditional spring training,” Minnesota Twins reliever Taylor Rogers said. “I don’t know if I can speak for everybody because it’s easier for the relievers. I don’t know how the starters are going to get ready or stretched out. And then the hitters, that’s a whole different ballgame. I’m sure it’s going to be difficult for them early. They haven’t seen live pitching in three months now.”
 Aside from the accelerated timeline, other logistical issues could arise as teams figure out how to turn their home ballparks into training camps following an uptick in infections in Florida and Arizona. The Tigers announced Wednesday they would use Comerica Park in Detroit, which obviously has less field space than the team’s sprawling spring training complex in Florida. General manager Al Avila said players would have their time on the field staggered.
 The Texas Rangers, who still haven’t played a game in their new retractable roof stadium, plan to use the home, visitor and auxiliary clubhouses to spread out players and staff. The team also has access to its former stadium across the street, even though the field was converted for the XFL and soccer.

A CLEARER picture has emerged of the fallout from a major Coast building group’s collapse, with unsecured creditors claiming total debts of about $31 million.                     Initial investigations by liquidators had indicated there wouldn’t be sufficient recoveries to secure a return for unsecured creditors of RGD Group Pty Ltd and RGD Constructions Pty Ltd.          The two Coast-based companies directed by Ron Grabbe were placed into voluntary administration last month, before liquidators were formally appointed on June 12.          A recent report to creditors found about $13.5 million – $14.5 million had been lost by RGD Constructions due to a range of issues on the Virtuoso project, a premium, riverfront apartment development by Stockwell in Brisbane’s West End.          FTI Consulting investigators also found “comprehensive losses” of about $10 million and $9.3 million had been recorded by RGD Constructions in the 2019 and 2020 financial years.          A list of unsecured creditors of both companies obtained by the _Daily_ showed the scales of debts being claimed by a mix of trade suppliers, banking firms, the taxation office and others.          The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation had claimed debts of more than $138,000 against RGD Constructions and more than $388,000 against RGD Group.          Other notable claims against RGD Group included more than $513,000 owed to Bimcrest Pty Ltd, more than $287,000 owed to Peter Saunders and more than $112,000 to Regency Fabrication.          Some of the more significant claims against RGD Constructions included more than $128,000 by Marc Air Conditioning Services, more than $115,000 by QE Doors and Frames Pty Ltd and more than $109,000 by Six Star Tiling Pty Ltd.          Both companies had several other claims in the tens of thousands of dollars recorded.          Among the unsecured creditors was Native Coatings Pty Ltd, which had claimed a total of more than $150,000 owed by both companies.          Native Coatings owner Dorian Smerdon had also written to Fisher MP Andrew Wallace, a former building industry barrister, about his predicament.          In a bitter blow, Mr Smerdon claimed another builder had also gone bust in recent weeks, leaving him about $250,000 out of pocket in total.          Mr Wallace said his advice was to seek independent legal advice, and he tried to assist where he could.          “As an ex-builder and ex-construction law barrister I get many phone calls from subcontractors and builders chasing money,” Mr Wallace said.          RGD Group shareholder Greg Clark was also listed as an unsecured creditor with debts owed of almost $28 million against both companies, having provided significant financial support prior to the collapse of the two companies.          Clark Group had since taken over a number of RGD projects, including Southbank at Birtinya Island and Seanna Residences at Bokarina Beach.                                                                                            0

A young husband-and-wife duo discovered the makings of a tasty new business when they unknowingly reactivated a wild seed bank on their small horticulture farm. Now Little Green Growers supplies edible flowers and rare herbs to top restaurants in the west, and sells organic plug plants across the country.Denise Rocks, originally from Co Clare, took a Masters in Development at University Limerick and decided to put it to good use by working in Haiti, following the 2010 earthquake.While leading entrepreneurship and educational projects in Haiti, she met her husband, Stephane.In 2016, they moved to Ireland and bought a cottage by the sea in Spiddal, Co Galway. It came with a small holding which had been used by the previous owners for grazing cattle but had been left overgrown with brambles and bracken.&quot;Stephane had trained with USAID (United States Agency for International Development) on environmental compliance and had also consulted on farm projects in Haiti so he had a background in farming and horticulture,&quot; says Denise.&quot;We decided to transform the land into a horticulture farm for our own use, to grow food for ourselves.&quot;Both being ecologically minded, the couple cultivated the land by hand, using traditional hand-tools. They then planted an acre of vegetables from seed.&quot;We got our farm up and running and it was supplying us with our own food, which was great,&quot; says Denise. They continued to improve the land by hand and in 2018, a wild seed bank reactivated.&quot;Several varieties of edible flowers started to grow, such as fuschia, elderflower and wild roses,&quot; says Denise. &quot;There were also wild herbs and rare foods such as wood sorrel and wild garlic. We had to do some research to confirm that these were the types of food that were growing on the land.&quot;The discovery of these rare plants prompted the idea for Denise and Stephane's new business.&quot;We knew these plants were uncommon but we also knew that finding the right market could be complex,&quot; she says.The couple started by approaching restaurants and cafes in the west and got a positive response, with many agreeing to buy their produce. Local mixologists also began buying their produce for use in cocktails.&quot;It was clear that there was a market for what we had growing so we decided to expand the range and began planting more varieties of edible flowers and wild herbs from seed,&quot; says Denise.To allow wildlife to flourish, Denise and Stephane have kept the farm relatively small and only use one acre for their own planted produce. They became members of the Galway Food Charter and of the Galway Gastronomy movement. They have also participated in consultations for Failte Ireland's Taste the Island campaign and are official business supporters of the All Ireland Pollinator Plan. They now grow an assortment of unusual wild, organic plants, many of which are edible.&quot;We supply 12 award-winning and innovative restaurants weekly across Galway, with produce grown to order. We also supply food producer-focused shops like McCambridge's Galway and we recently started to supply directly to brides for weddings and to bakers who use our edible flowers for wedding cake decorating,&quot; says Denise.Business had been thriving until Covid-19 struck and forced most of Denise and Stephane's customers to temporarily shut their doors.&quot;Even those that switched to takeaway couldn't use our products, which are best as a garnish on a fresh meal,&quot; says Denise.&quot;However, just as this happened, our full organic certification, which we had invested two years in, came through from the Organic Trust.&quot;A few of my fellow women in business encouraged me to establish a new area, revenue stream-focused, supplying Irish-grown, sustainably-produced, certified organic plants to gardeners across Ireland.&quot;A nursery had always been in the pipeline for Denise and Stephane regardless, so they quickly invested in equipment, chose seed varieties from their stock and surveyed potential customers. They decided to grow certified organic plug plants.&quot;This was a very different business model to our original one as we were now going to be selling directly to gardeners right across the country,&quot; says Denise.&quot;We had to revamp and rebrand the website and test suitable packaging and courier options.&quot;It was important to the couple that all packaging was made from recyclable materials and could be recycled.&quot;Certified organic means they are grown from untreated seed with no use of chemicals,&quot; says Denise. &quot;This means, unlike regular uncertified plants, you can grow and eat them safely knowing you won't be exposed to any hidden pesticides or fungicides.&quot;They're also safe for butterflies and bees.Denise and Stephane have a 'Garden Guru' service on their website - www.littlegreengrowers.ie - where you can ask the experts about growing your produce. &lsquo;Covid-19 threw us a curve ball but we used it to the best of our advantage&rsquo; I don't have an exact figure but it wasn't a huge cost. We did it as economically as possible, and it's our philosophy to reduce waste so we upcycled the sheds on the premises rather than knock them and build new ones.Seeing as many of the rare foods and wild flowers were already there, we didn't have a big investment.Yes, we could have got a business loan from the banks to start up the business but we decided not to go down that route. We used our own money to start things up.We didn't require planning for our business. We didn't actually build anything.We are registered with 'The Organic Trust' through the Department of Agriculture.What grant aid or other assistance was available?We didn't apply for any grant aid but I was chosen for the ACORNS programme in 2019. It supports early-stage female entrepreneurs living in rural Ireland. It's not a grant aid, it's mentorship.The ACORNS programme has been fantastic, especially throughout Covid-19 - it provides great mentorship and advice.Triona Mac Giolla Rí, the co-founder and director of Aró Digital Strategy, is also a great support to me. The Department of Agriculture, Failte Ireland and the All Ireland Pollinator Plan have all been helpful too.We weren't required to get any insurance but we decided to get product insurance anyway.I just have to file my taxes at the end of each year. I still work full time as a regional skills manager for the West of Ireland as well as having this business.It only took about six months to get the business up and running originally. The pivot for the new side of the business was even quicker, it took just one month. We needed it to be quick.So far no, everything has worked out well. Covid-19 threw us a curve ball but we used it to the best of our advantage.

HOUSTON — The first round of spring training was dominated by fallout from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scam.
 Players were plunked in exhibition games and heckled at every turn. Fans held signs mocking Houston players, and one man even banged on a trash can at an early workout in a reminder of how the Astros illegally stole signals during their run to the 2017 World Series title and again in the 2018 season.
 With a second stretch of practices just around the corner after Major League Baseball committed to a 60-game season this week, will the AL champion Astros be able to move on from the cheating scandal after a layoff that lasted almost four months?
 Are fans and opponents ready to forgive and forget? Or will the anger toward this team remain for its past transgressions?
 Astros owner Jim Crane, who fired manager AJ Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow last winter after Commissioner Rob Manfred suspended both for one season as penalty for their roles in the scandal, hopes things will be better this time around.
 “We broke the rules," Crane said Wednesday. “We got punished. We accepted the punishment and we did what we did. We let two of our key guys go."
 “We think we’ve handled it appropriately," he continued. “I’m not happy about the whole situation. We’ve got to accept what we did. We own it and I’ll talk to the players about it one more time and hopefully we can move on from that and make sure that it doesn’t happen again."
 The Astros were almost certain to face hostile crowds on every road trip this year and knew they'd hear even more heckling as they began to play games that counted. But that might not be an issue now that the coronavirus pandemic has forced a shortened season that will — at the very least — start without fans in ballparks.
 New manager Dusty Baker, a respected MLB veteran, helped the team navigate reaction to the scandal during the first spring training, which was stopped on March 12 because of the virus. He doesn't know if the changed circumstances since then will make it easier to move on.
 “I’m not really sure until we get there," Baker said. “This is all uncharted waters. None of us have been through this before in spring training, the emotions that were out there."
 While catcalls from unhappy fans in the stands might not pose a problem for the Astros this year, they could have to deal with being intentionally hit by pitches when the season gets underway. Several Houston players were dinged in spring training games before the pause.
 Some opponents had called for retaliation against the Astros, irritated that no Houston players were disciplined for their roles in the scandal. MLB's investigation found that Houston used the video feed from a center field camera to see and decode the opposing catcher’s signs. Players banged on a trash can to signal to batters what kind of pitch was coming, believing it would improve the batter’s chances of getting a hit.
 Manfred addressed the subject of the Astros being intentionally hit by pitches as a means of retaliation this spring, saying it was “really dangerous” and won't be tolerated.
 Despite his warning, the Astros could still be subjected to beanings when the season begins by those who still aren't over what they did.
 But for now, the Astros can't worry about what might happen, so they will simply try to look ahead. And while Crane is optimistic they will be able to move forward, he knows the scandal will linger and hover over his team.
 “This story will continue for a long time and it will always be discussed," he said. “And it’s unfortunate we were right in the middle of that and I’m not happy about it and I’ve apologized numerous times. It shouldn’t have happened ... we’re sorry we did it. We’ve apologized to the fans. We just want to go play baseball now."
 Baker, managing for the first time since being fired by the Washington Nationals after the 2017 season, is looking forward to doing just that.
 “The guys are ready," he said. “They’ve got a great attitude. We want to go back to the top where we belong.”
