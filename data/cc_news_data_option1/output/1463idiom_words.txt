The Fort Branch High School Gym was built in 1939. Fort Branch High School was one of the three high schools under South Gibson School Corporation that merged into Gibson Southern High School in 1974. Fort Branch High School's mascot was the Twigs and the school colors were black and gold. The building was then used as the Fort Branch Middle School (grades 6-8) until 1982 when the Fort Branch Community School building was completed. The school was demolished, but the gymnasium continues to be used for community functions.
