For Tommy Doyle, the strange 2020 professional baseball campaign turned out far better than he could have imagined.
 The shortened 60-game Major League regular season ended in the final week with the 2014 Flint Hill School graduate making his big-league pitching debut for the Colorado Rockies. The 6-foot-6 hard-throwing right-handed closer pitched in three games during the same week, with mixed success.
 Doyle got hit around some, but he did record two strikeouts.
 “I didn’t throw as many strikes as I had hoped, I walked too many and in that short time it was hard to tell if my stuff worked up there,” Doyle said. “But the two strikeouts proved I can strike out Major League hitters.”
 If the 2020 baseball season had been a normal campaign and the start not postponed significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Doyle figures he likely would have played the entire year in the minor leagues at some level.
 After enjoying a strong season at high-level minor league A ball in 2019, Doyle was invited to the Rockies big-league spring training camp in 2020 in Arizona, reporting Feb. 1. When that was cut short and he was sent home on March 13 because of the pandemic, Doyle eventually was added to the Rockies Major League alternative roster.
 Once he returned to the complex in July, with a fastball clocked as high as 97 MPH, Doyle worked out and practiced with those players in intrasquad competition close to the Rockies home field in Denver. After a while, Doyle was promoted to a three-player taxi squad.
 As the regular season drew to a close and with the Rockies out of the playoff hunt, Doyle was promoted to the big club in the final week. In pro-baseball circles, a jump from A-ball to the Majors in one year isn’t a common occurrence.
 Doyle had been pitching well at the alternative camp. He thinks the reason he got the big callup was to give him that experience since he was close by and been working out.
 “Oh yeah, I was surprised I got called up,” Doyle said. “Maybe it was to get my feet wet and have that experience for upcoming seasons.”

WICHITA, Kan. (Wichita State Athletics) – The Black Team earned a 10-3 victory over the Yellow Team in game one of the Wichita State Baseball Black and Yellow Fall World Series Saturday, Oct. 10, at Eck Stadium, Home of Tyler Field.  Jack Sigrist pounded out three hits and drove in a pair of RBI, while Corrigan Bartlett belted a three-run home run, leading the Black Team at the plate. Paxton Wallace and Seth Stroh each posted two hits, with Wallace also tallying a double, respectively.  Reliever Aaron Bechtel (1-0) earned the victory on the mound after throwing one inning and allowing an earned run on two hits.   Sigrist put the Black Team in front, 1-0, after hitting single to left field to bring in Andrew Stewart in the bottom of the second inning. Yellow took a brief, 2-1, advantage with a pair of runs in the third. Jalon Mack scored the opening run of the frame on a sacrifice fly off the bat of Cooper Elliot, prior to Garrett Kocis smashing an RBI triple down the right field line for the go-ahead run.  Black came charging back in the bottom-half of the inning, plating four runs, jumping out to a 5-2 advantage on a Noah Greise two-run single and Cooper Harris two-RBI double.  After Yellow trimmed the lead to 5-3 with a run in the top of the sixth, Black responded with four more runs in the bottom of the inning, highlighted by a three-run homer to left-center from Bartlett, ballooning the score to 9-3.  Couper Cornblum went 2-for-4 with a double, pacing Yellow in the batter's box, while Mack added a ground-rule double.  Game two, which is closed to the public, is slated for Monday, Oct. 12.

 The cause of schools not being fully open was mostly "due to Covid-19 related reasons", the Department for Education confirmed.
 It comes as an Ofsted report warned that many heads saw the lack of availability of Covid-19 testing as "a real barrier" to staying up and running.
 The report – based on 121 pilot visits to schools across England last month – said: "Leaders of some small schools described how quickly their school might have to close if staff could not get tested when they needed to, though this fear was shared by schools of all sizes."

The start of the boys high-school lacrosse season is months away. Yet, the Wakefield Warriors and new head coach Antonio Francis want all to know the squad is already eagerly preparing for that 2021 campaign, both mentally and as much as they are allowed, physically with some offseason workouts beginning this month.
 The spring season – if it occurs – will be unique for Francis and Wakefield because this past spring’s campaign was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Francis was especially disappointed the Warriors couldn’t play, as he believed they were prepared to show much improvement compared to the program’s recent struggles.
 Wakefield did manage two spring scrimmage matches, which included a victory and one-goal loss, before the plug was pulled on the 2020 season. The win was a 6-3 triumph over Gar-Field. Francis received a text during halftime of that contest informing him the season would be canceled after the conclusion of that scrimmage.
 “I waited to tell the players until after the game, and that was tough,” Francis said. “There were a lot of hung heads, because our hopes and mindsets were high for the season. We want to change the lacrosse scene in South Arlington.”
 Francis was hired in September of 2019. With a lofty number of 52 players in the program, Francis was confident he had the team well prepared physically and mentally with a fresh outlook and attitude for a new and successful beginning.
 Then the season was canceled.
 “We had a new attitude and identity, new uniforms, we were just getting started and thought we had something new and improved,” Francis said. “They were so ready to go. Then nothing. We didn’t have that season to get better and develop skills. That was especially tough because our players need all the exposure to the game as they can get.”

NEW BEDFORD -- Carrie Hawthorne found herself running through the Buttonwood Park Zoo hysterically laughing with her daughter and the rest of her team as they were trying to "escape" the zoo before time ran out.
 As education curator for the zoo, Hawthorne was testing out a new program at the zoo, Deja Zoo -- Escape Experience, before it was offered to the public.
 The zoo began offering the after-hours program in September, according to Hawthorne, to teams of up to 10 players at a cost of $300.
 The teams that schedule an escape experience are first met by an animal ambassador when they enter the zoo and can learn a little bit about the animal as they wait for their entire group to arrive.
 The team then has full rein of the zoo -- as long as they stay together as a group -- to solve a series of puzzles, unlock boxes, and find things throughout the zoo all before the 90-minute time limit runs out, according to Hawthorne.
 The team is able to beat the clock by solving all the necessary clues to open a lock box containing a timer that they have to shut off, Hawthorne explained.
 All throughout the experience participants will learn about conservation and the zoo's animals.
 Since the program started in September, Hawthorne said the zoo has scheduled an average of two escape experiences a week.
 The zoo staff had been toying around with the idea of escape experience for a while, Hawthorne said, but never had the time to focus on it before.
 The coronavirus pandemic provided that time, especially as they've been trying to find ways to make the zoo accessible to people in different ways.
 "One thing we're discovering is that some people don't feel comfortable being at the zoo when it's open to the public," Hawthorne said, so offering them the opportunity to come and have the zoo to themselves for a few hours has been appealing.
 In addition to the escape experience, the zoo is also offering private after- hours zoo tours for groups of 10 or less with each tour costing $350 and lasting two hours.
 The group has a tour guide and is able to interact with some of the keepers and animals along the way.
 Hawthorne said it's a nice laid back way to see the zoo when you don't feel comfortable being there with other groups of people.
 The zoo has scheduled an average of one private zoo tour per week since September, Hawthorne said.
 Both programs have attracted people looking to celebrate special occasions like birthdays, according to Hawthorne who said booking a private experience at the zoo can be a special thing to do at a time when large parties are discouraged.
 The after-hours programs have allowed the zoo to use their staff in a fun way and bring in some revenue, Hawthorne said.
 Testing out the escape experience was even something different for Hawthorne who has worked at the zoo for six years.
 "I've never experienced the zoo in that way," she said.
 The response to the escape experience has been very positive, Hawthorne said, with many groups that have gone through it saying they would come back to do it again if the zoo staff developed new clues and puzzles.
 Hawthorne said the zoo staff is constantly thinking of alternate forms of revenue, but it's difficult since state guidelines are constantly changing.
 Since they're never sure what the next mandate will bring, they also continue to work on virtual programming.
 The zoo does plan to hold its popular BOO at the Zoo! program but, like regular admittance to the zoo, they will be offering a limited number of timed admission tickets due to the pandemic.
 The zoo staff is in the process of developing ways to hand out candy that are socially distant, including using shoots, and have socially distant activities for children like obstacle course.
 One thing will be the same as every year though, Hawthorne said, the zoo will be beautifully decorated.

MIDDLEBORO -- Fall is a busy time of year for the New England Coastal Wildlife Alliance (NECWA). This is the time of year when various coastal species get stranded in shallow waters and beached because they can't find their way back to deep waters.
 "We're the only organization that works with and tries to rescue sunfish who get stranded on beaches and trapped in Cape Cod Bay in the fall. They need warmer waters in winter and should be heading south," explained Krill Carson, president of NECWA, who for the last 15 years has worked to make it a prominent nonprofit environmental organization in the SouthCoast and Cape regions.
 Based in Middleboro, the all-volunteer organization studies and helps any marine wildlife it can, but primarily focuses on sunfish, basking sharks and every species of turtles you can find in New England.
 "All wildlife is interesting. I didn't want this to be about just one animal or species. I wanted this nonprofit to be more comprehensive and inclusive. One that was focused on all coastal wildlife," said Carson, on why she formed NECWA.
 One of its biggest projects at the moment for NECWA concerns the nesting habitats of terrapins, more specifically, the diamondback terrapin, in many of New England's coastal marshes. "It's an elusive animal. They're very skittish," Carson said.The group often patrols beaches in Wareham, Marion, Mattapoisett and Pocasset and looks for females coming out of the water to nest, as well as the nests containing terrapin hatchlings.
 Diamondback terrapins are listed as threatened species in Massachusetts. In addition to surveying areas and documenting encounters, they also tag the mothers and hatchlings to follow their movements, and relocate nests if they are deemed in unsafe areas, like being too close to roads or in areas with too many predators. Carson said the group also works with Mass Audubon in responding to a lot of turtle strandings along beaches on the Cape. If Krill is the heart and brain of NECWA, then its base of volunteers are its appendages. During peak periods in the year NECWA can employ an average of 50 to 60 volunteers, most of them students and student interns from high school and college.
 "Krill is charismatic and friendly. Her personality is what draws you in and wants to take part in projects," said Jack Gerrior, a Middleboro resident, Junior at Massachusetts Maritime Academy (MMA), and long-time volunteer with NECWA.
 Students from all over the country have come to volunteer with NECWA throughout the years because of the enormous educational, research and networking opportunities it presents. "It's kind of like family. They never go away. It's hard getting a job in this field without experience. We provide as much networking and hands on experiences as possible. That's one of our missions," Carson said.
 Gerrior was already enrolled in the Marine Science, Safety and Environmental Protection program at MMA when Carson did a presentation on sunfish at his school. Gerrior has been volunteering for NECWA off and on the last two years, doing field work pertaining to surveys of terrapin habitats, as well as taking samples of dead, stranded sun fish.
 "They're everywhere on the Cape, yet we don't fully understand them. Much like sharks, sunfish are mysteries of science. Krill is on the frontier of trying to understand this species," Gerrior said. Katrina Bingham-Maas, a sophomore at Westfield State University, credits Krill and NECWA for getting her into environmental science. As she explained, Carson came to Middleboro High School in her junior year and did a presentation on sunfish.
 Katrina later encountered her at a table set up at Soule Homestead where "Krill got a call about a sunfish washing up on a beach. She offered to take me with her. It was 446 pounds A very cool experience."
 Katrina did her senior internship with NECWA and has volunteered off and on with them over the last two years in the field working with sunfish and terrapins. A senior at the University of Minnesota Duluth, Hunter Smith, is focused on a future in drone surveying. He traveled all the way over to Massachusetts this past summer for an internship with NECWA where, from July to late September, conducted drone surveys of habitats of diamondback terrapins. "All my drone work before was agricultural surveys. This is revolutionary work being done here. I don't see any other places doing this. I'm excited to be part of the revolution," Smith said.Volunteers for NECWA emphasize that despite the marine science and environmental focus, they need volunteers to help out on several fronts.
 "There's lots of positions that go into something like this. Social media, fundraising. Anyone who's interested, but doesn't want to go out into the field. Krill will find a way for you to help," Bingham-Maas said."Krill's looking for people in inter-disciplinary interests. NECWA appeals to different fields and genres and we'll take anyone we can find, and use them to best of their ability," Gerrior said.2020 hasn't been kind for any business or organization, let alone a nonprofit organization comprised entirely of unpaid volunteers. The pandemic changed plans for many of NECWA's volunteers, some to the organization's benefit as cancelled plans meant a healthy amount of work being done over the summer.Smith, from Minnesota, admitted that all of his other internship options in the Midwestern part of the country fell through because of the pandemic, which is what directed him to the Northeast and NECWA.
 Bingham-Maas originally was going to work as a camp counselor in Vermont during the summer. When that was canceled, she worked part-time hours at NECWA. Gerrior, who wants to work for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) when he graduates, was originally scheduled to for a college internship on a fishing trawler out of Wood's Hole for the summer doing
 shrimp surveys in the Gulf of Maine. That fell through and he instead spent his time with NECWA. Regardless of healthy community involvement, it's been tough year for the organization. "We've always struggled. We all work other jobs, trying to make a living. COVID made it even harder," Carson said. In addition to grant money that comes from state programs and donors, NECWA normally fundraises all year through tabling, events, talks by Carson and other means, like its online store and virtual wildlife adoption program. "We did a lot of good work in the summer and we're doing work in the fall. Stranding season is here and we're not going to stop for COVID. We have to be here for them," Carson said.Over the summer NECWA took additional preparations to prevent possible contamination from COVID-19, including limiting the amount of volunteers working together in the field, temporarily halting rotating out volunteers during shifts, keeping them restricted to specific days of the week and even buying gear and supplies to lessen any sharing. "Financially, it's been very difficult, but no one got sick," Carson said.
