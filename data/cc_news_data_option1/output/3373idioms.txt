Romanised could return to ParisLongchamp next month in an attempt to avenge last season’s defeat in the Prix du Moulin.
 The Ken Condon-trained five-year-old came agonisingly close to taking the Group One showpiece in 2019, finishing just a nose behind Aidan O’Brien’s Circus Maximus after a battle up the home straight.
 The horse has since regained winning form, successfully defending his crown in the Group Two Minstrel Stakes at the Curragh in July, before finishing only fifth in the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville earlier this month.
 “He’s come out of Deauville very well,” Condon said.
 “Obviously the ground was too testing for him, but he travelled very well throughout the race to the two-furlong pole. He got pretty tired in the last furlong on that deep ground, but he’s come out of the race looking very well.”
 Condon is now considering treading a similar path to last term in returning to Paris – but will allow himself to choose the most favourable going by also entering a handful of alternative Group One contests.

 “He’ll do a bit of work next week and we’ll keep an eye on the weather in Paris with a view to the Prix du Moulin,” he said.
 “I think there’s a good chance he’ll go there. He’ll have entries in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and the Prix de la Foret as well, but the ground will dictate where he goes.
 “He needs good ground so we’ll be watching the weather closely, but he’s good after Deauville and there’s a good chance we’ll go to ParisLongchamp next.”

A transformation of U.S. national security policy is underway. It’s practically a sleight of hand: While observers have been transfixed by the slugfest between the United States and China, a much more subtle and invidious shift is taking place, one that has sweeping implications. The Trump administration’s equation of national security with economic security makes sense — if done carefully and with careful attention. Neither appears to be the case.
 Traditionally, national strength reflected hard power — a nation’s military capabilities. Economic success was an important factor in calculating a country’s power, but national wealth was key to building a more effective military. The Meiji-era Japan crystalized this mindset as _fukoku kyohei_ , or "rich nation, strong army.” Thinking about power has matured and we now recognize that there are other ways both to secure the nation and exercise power in the international system. Still, few countries — no matter how successful or wealthy — have been willing to bet their survival on those alternatives and dispense with their military.

Joe Barnes (4-20) got into the early order, Steve Moore (2-12) bothered the men in the middle the Alfie Huxtable (2-11) removed most of the stragglers as Braunton dismissed B&P for 106. Matt Newton battled it out for 33 off 53 balls and Rob Holm made 22 to post the only Barnstaple scores of note. Braunton openers Sam Bithell (65no) and Jack Whittaker (32no) hurtled to victory inside 18 overs. Matt Jarvis - eight overs for 23 runs - was the lone bowler to make life difficult for the Kelseymen. Moore, Braunton's senior player, said after a 'brilliant opening spell' from Barnes everything else just fell into place. "Overall we bowled to our plans, backed up by some exceptional fielding," said Moore. "Youngsters Bithell and Whittaker batted very sensibly in a century opening stand." Lee Cole, the Barnstaple and Pilton captain, said little went well for his side. "We didn't bat well enough to register a decent score and we certainly didn't bowl well enough as Braunton knocked the runs of with ease and never looked in a any trouble," said Cole. Braunton entertain Bideford this Saturday with the prize of a place in the Tier Three championship semi-finals waiting for the winners. The losers will qualify for the ranking play-off announced by league managers late last week. Bideford cruised to a six-wicket win over North Devon 2nd XI that keeps them out in front in North One going into the final round of fixtures. North Devon's 164 for nine in 40 overs always looked below par at Westward Ho! and so it proved as Bideford knocked off the runs with exactly six overs to spare. Opener Jay Rothery top scored for North Devon with 31 and lower down there were chip-ins from Issac Windley (21), James Thomas (29) and keeper Jonny Green. Bideford's frontline bowlers kept the lid on North Devon virtually from start to finish. Jack Ford (4-16) did most of the damage while Alex Hannam (1-27), Jamie Lathwell (0-29) and Steve Bond (2-18) kept it tight. Bideford lost opener James Hayter to James Starkey (2-36) early in proceedings. The Fords - dad James and lad Jack - soon followed. Surviving opener Tom Brend (71no) was joined by Ashley Baker with the score on 48 for three and by the time Baker was dismissed for 52 the game was over as a contest. North Devon conclude their pool games away to Barnstaple and Pilton this Saturday.

There is a need to grow domestic manufacturing, private sector participation and boost job creation, according to RC Bhargava, Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
 Speaking at the 39th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the company, Bhargava said that socialisation of manufacturing costs has made the sector uncompetitive.
 “There has to be a national consensus on the need to grow manufacturing and on the need to create jobs. And the strategy for growing manufacturing, now I think there can be no two opinions on the way to go forward. There needs to be national consensus on this. If that happens, the kind of changes that are required becomes much easier. They will happen much faster,” Bhagava said.
 “So, my approach into this is to say that all of us should understand the changes that are required, participate and support the Government policies to bring about the changes and make India a more competitive manufacturing country,” he said.
 Highlighting the lacunae that hamper the growth of manufacturing, Bhargava said, “One has to understand the various constraints which apply to a democracy like us. Like the political situation which we have and steps which any Government will take have to be consistent with all the factors of the country, not just say that we will do whatever is required for manufacturing and then ignore all the other factors.”
 ## Soviet policies
 “We must remember that the initial problem with manufacturing growth arose because we adopted the Soviet policies or they were based on the Soviet policies of economic development. And at that time, these policies looked very attractive to a large part of the world and what we did was consistent to what a lot of people were advocating at that time. However, as time passed it was apparent that these policies were not delivering the results,” he said.
 “The unfortunate part is that we didn’t change with time. And we persisted with the same set of policies even though they were failing to deliver results. Amongst these policies which led to the non-competitiveness of the industry were the Government’s efforts to cross subsidise and bring about socialism, by making industry pay for various kinds of economic activities and infrastructure which was required both by the people of the country and by the industry,” Bhargava added.
 But this led to the cost of production going up and was one of the factors why we were not competitive, he said.

 “It was a really special night,” Delport admitted. “We lost our first game to Middlesex at Lord’s and it was a nice way to introduce myself, but you want the team to win and do well.
 “We had kind of a bumpy season, then we had a few wins in a row which got our momentum going and we qualified for Finals Day and the rest is history!”
 Essex will start this campaign against Middlesex as well, but with the fixture at Chelmsford on Thursday, and this year may prove Delport’s last with the county.

The experiment has backfired. We’re not even through August and cases are surging in Western Europe, while Southeastern Europe, which avoided the worst of the initial virus wave, is up against it too. Germany won plaudits for its handling of the spring outbreak, but it recorded more than 2,000 new cases last Saturday — the biggest daily jump since April.
 One big factor has been the restart of intra-European travel, including people going on vacation or visiting family and friends. Almost 40 percent of recent German cases are thought to have been contracted abroad, according to the Robert Koch Institute. That’s similar to Italy, where almost a third of new cases were imported from overseas. Italians holidaying on Sardinia have also brought the virus back to the mainland.
 There has also been a spate of European cases linked to parties. France — with almost 5,000 new infections reported on Sunday — says this is its main source of new contagion. No wonder the European Union’s trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, is under pressure to quit after attending a hotel dinner with about 80 guests, in contravention of Ireland’s rules.
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel says Europe must avoid closing borders again "at any cost.” Free movement is central to the EU project, and shutting borders contributed to a collapse in economic output in the spring. Yet politicians can’t ignore the fact that people are catching the virus abroad and bringing it home.
 For those who never travel overseas, for domestic business owners who’ve already suffered through one lockdown not of their making, and for the medical staff who must treat another cohort of COVID-19 patients, these developments are especially frustrating. The answer is much more rigorous testing and monitoring of returning travelers and much stricter rules around social gatherings.
 Fortunately, the number of new hospitalizations and deaths is a fraction of what it was in the spring because there are more cases among young people, who experience either mild symptoms or none at all. The detection of more imported cases points to some improvements in testing. With the summer travel season drawing to a close, the problem of returning travelers should abate somewhat.
 But the economic damage done by this new spike is already considerable. Friday’s tepid eurozone services data and Ryanair Holdings’ decision to scale back its autumn flight schedule suggest consumers are becoming more cautious. The list of countries subject to quarantine measures is growing.
 There’s a risk too that infections will begin to spread from young people to the elderly, and that schools and nurseries will be closed again — every parent’s and finance minister’s nightmare. In the two weeks since they’ve reopened, more than 40 Berlin schools have already reported virus cases, forcing pupils and teachers to quarantine, according to The Associated Press.
 Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron say they’re determined to avoid new lockdowns, but they need to get a grip. There is plenty that governments can do without reimposing draconian measures. It’s vital that anyone arriving from a high-risk area is tested. In Germany checks for returning travelers are free. However, local health authorities don't always have the capacity to monitor returning passengers to ensure they’ve been tested or quarantined. There are reports of long delays in getting results.
 German infections have also surged among parents and children returning from Southeast Europe. The DRV German travel association’s attempt to blame migrants for this and exonerate package holidaymakers was crude and unhelpful. Popular holiday destinations also feature prominently in the list of imported cases.
 A rise in German cases linked to weddings and private parties was hardly a shock because the rules around friends and families meeting vary so widely. Federal states are allowed to set their own guidelines and some are too permissive: In Berlin as many as 500 people can meet inside. In contrast, England restricts private gatherings to a maximum of 30 people and the government has threatened fines for breaches. Ireland has tightened restrictions so that only six people may meet indoors. (Up to 50 people can attend a wedding.)
 German Health Minister Jens Spahn is right that if we must choose between reopening schools or having parties and attending carnivals, then the choice is obvious. Germany and other countries with surging infections should take their lead from Airbnb Inc., which has banned parties at its properties and put a cap on occupancy of 16.
 Unless Europe gets the basics right then countries may be forced to take even more unpopular measures to protect their populations, including advising the elderly to stay home and keep away from younger relatives. The autumn and winter months won’t be easy, but acting now can avoid unnecessary hardship.
