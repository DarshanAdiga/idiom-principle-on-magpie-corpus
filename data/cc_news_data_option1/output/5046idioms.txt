 # Indiana State downs Western women
 WIU ATHLETIC COMMUNICATIONS
 TERRE HAUTE, Ind. - The Western Illinois women's basketball team (0-4) concluded their third game in three days in a loss to Indiana State (3-1) 78-51 on Monday (Dec. 7) night.
 "This has been a really tough few days," head coach JD Gravina said. "I definitely felt like we were physically and mentally exhausted, as expected. We are really out of shape, and just not ready to play at a high level. We knew going in that this early part of the season would be a struggle, but I'm excited to build into the team we can be."
 The Sycamores began the game on a 10-0 run and never looked back. Western finally got on the board with a free-throw from Evan Zars at 4:07 and trailed 17-6 after the first ten minutes.
 Anna Deets notched the first field goal for the Leathernecks with a three- pointer just under a minute in the first quarter. The freshman ended with 11 points and has hit a three in each game this year.
 Fellow newcomer Mallory McDermott provided a spark off the bench in the fourth quarter as she started her own 11-point burst to finish in double-figures for the first time.
 Indiana State stayed hot and opened up an 8-0 run to start the second quarter before Danni Nichols stopped it with a layup. Backed behind shooting 45.7 percent from the field and 33.3 from the three in the first half, ISU led 36-21 at halftime.
 Western Illinois struggled to find its footing offensively, shooting 26.1 percent from the field and ISU didn't slow down in the second half to defeat WIU for the first time since 2002.
 The Purple and Gold head to Southeast Missouri on Friday (Dec. 11), before returning to host the 2020-21 home opener on Sunday (Dec. 13) against Illinois State.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jalen Hurts will start for the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, sending Carson Wentz to the bench. Eagles coach Doug Pederson made the announcement Tuesday on the team’s website. “We’re not where we want to be as an offense,\" Pederson said. \"I looked at the whole thing and decided that for this week to look for that spark again to try to get the team over the hump, to try to get everybody playing better.” Pederson insisted Monday the decision was his, even though Wentz’s $128 million, four-year contract begins in 2021. Hurts replaced Wentz in the third quarter of a 30-16 loss to Green Bay and completed 5 of 12 passes for 109 yards, one touchdown, one interception and took three sacks. “Carson is like all of us right now, he’s disappointed. He’s frustrated,” Pederson said. “He’s been a professional through it all. He supports his teammates and that’s what you want to see from him, the leader of the team. I know sometimes the quarterback gets a lot of the blame like the head coach does. It’s the good with the bad. It’s not about Carson Wentz. It’s not about one person. We know we have issues on offense and it has been a struggle for us all season. That’s where the frustration lies a little bit, but he’s been a pro and would expect nothing less.” Pederson and Wentz came to Philadelphia in 2016. They led the Eagles to the franchise’s only Super Bowl title in 2017. Wentz was 11-2 before a knee injury forced him to watch Nick Foles lead the Eagles through the playoffs and victory over New England. Wentz finished third in NFL MVP voting that season, and last year he became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for more than 4,000 yards without one wide receiver having 500 yards receiving. But Wentz has a...

Now, the number of COVID-19 cases has been continuing to skyrocket over the past few weeks. I guess it’s safe to say that the demand for food delivery will stick around or even increase in the coming months. That said, would you agree that now is a good time for DoorDash to go public? If yes, would you be taking a stake in this food delivery company this week? Assuming you haven’t made up your mind, here’s what you might want to know before making the decision.

For many it sounds like the incestuous world of Washington lobbyists -- Beltway insiders with lavish budgets to open doors to persuade officials and legislators to change rules or allocate funds for their clients.
 Because of strict rules born of decades of corruption and influence peddling, lobbyists have to publicly reveal their clients.
 But so-called strategic consultants like WestExec do not have to, because at least officially they are supposed to keep a distance from officials and lawmakers. They provide clients the lay of the land, telling them how to navigate policies and officialdom without taking them through the process.
 WestExec, though, is believed to have had a host of wealthy clients in the defense and security sectors. The American Prospect and The New York Times have identified among its customers drone maker Shield AI, which has a Pentagon contract; Schmidt Futures, controlled by Google former CEO Eric Schmidt; and Israeli artificial intelligence firm Windward.
 Pine Island, meanwhile, raised $283 million for investments, putting some of the money into defense manufacturers.
 \- Appearances - The WestExec officials all bring strong, technocratic resumes to their new positions. But the issue is appearances.
 Austin, for example, is also on the board of one of the Pentagon's largest arms suppliers, Raytheon.
 "OH COME ON. A General and Raytheon board? Possibly the worst of all options," tweeted Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project on Government Oversight.
 Richard Painter, a White House ethics lawyer in the 2000s, said the lack of transparency by strategic consultants is a serious problem.
 "Loopholes like this one flourished in the Trump era and must be closed. Client Names must at least be disclosed to ethics officials if not publicly," he said in tweeted comments.
 Bookbinder said that the turn by many Washington insiders to strategic consultancies rather than traditional lobby houses "is not a particularly great development for transparency."But the test will be if, unlike the Trump administration, Biden has officials make disclosures, divest and recuse themselves when their interests appear conflicted.
 "We're going to be watching carefully," he said.

A state committee tasked with helping to address the urgent needs of the Vermont State Colleges System has made draft recommendations that the institutions be restructured, administrative services consolidated and that the state adopt a strategic plan for funding the system. The chair of the VSC board said Monday that the panel would be reviewing the recommendations in the coming weeks. “All parties must recognize the seriousness and the need for urgency in working together to address these problems,” the Select Committee on the Future of Public Higher Education in Vermont said in its initial report. The state colleges system has struggled with a drop in the Northeast — and particularly in Vermont — in the number of high school graduates, low financial support from the state and competition from other schools. The pandemic worsened its struggles. This fall, Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill to provide bridge funding for the Vermont State Colleges System. “It is no longer possible for this can to be kicked further down the road, with hopes that the individual institutions and the Chancellor’s Office will come up with cost reductions substantial enough to achieve long-term financial sustainability, without help from the legislature working in partnership with the governor’s office,\" the interim report said. It follows a proposal by former Chancellor Jeb Spaulding last spring to close the two campuses of Northern Vermont University in Lyndon and Johnson and the technical college’s Randolph campus because of added financial troubles from the coronavirus pandemic. After public outcry over his proposal, he withdrew it and then resigned. The committee has advised that Castleton University, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College be unified...

As you may or may not know, the company’s revenue was also boosted by its purchase of Caviar from Square (SQ Stock Report) for $410 million late last year. But many do not expect DoorDash to make another major acquisition anytime soon. Recall that Uber (UBER Stock Report) recently completed the purchase of Postmates for $2.65 billion. Chances are, the food delivery market will only have a few winners in the end. And DoorDash is the clear leader here. Together with Caviar, DoorDash controlled 50% of the market share in October, according to Edison Trends. This is followed by UberEats/Postmates (33%) and Grubhub (16%) (GRUB Stock Report).

Oscar-winning filmmaker Steven Soderbergh is going behind the scenes for the next Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said Tuesday that Soderbergh, “Erin Brokovich” producer Stacey Sher and awards show veteran Jesse Collins have come on board to produce the 93rd Oscars telecast. It’s the first time producing the annual film awards for all three, who are taking up the mantle from last year’s producers Lynette Howell Taylor and Stephanie Allain. The 93rd Academy Awards were delayed two months earlier this year because of COVID-19’s effects on the film industry, but the show will still be televised live on ABC on April 25, 2021. No official announcements have been made as to whether 93rd Oscars will be virtual, as many other awards shows including the Emmys have done because of the pandemic, although signs point to a willingness to adapt to the moment. Academy President David Rubin and Academy CEO Dawn Hudson said that this upcoming show is “the perfect occasion for innovation and re-envisioning the possibilities for the awards show.” Collins also has experience. Earlier this year produced the virtual BET Awards and is also producing the Grammy Awards and the Super Bowl halftime show. “Jesse, Stacey and Steven are the ideal storytellers to harness the uniqueness of this moment,” said Craig Erwich, president of Hulu Originals and ABC Entertainment. Last year’s show, the second in a row without a host, had the smallest audience ever of 23.6 million viewers, down 20% from the year prior.

If you were to choose one among the major players in the food delivery space, DoorDash’s core business certainly looks more attractive, at least to me. But I don’t see a strong reason to jump in right at its IPO. That’s because its growth could abruptly slow down after humanity defeats the novel coronavirus. Then again, we should also consider the timing of this IPO. This is the time when the company is seeing explosive revenue growth and massive improvements in its margin. Perhaps you could say that the company’s insiders are looking to exit when the company is hot. But what will happen to the stock price when growth decelerates? Your guess is as good as mine. Now, I’m not sure about you, but if I have to choose one IPO to invest in this week, this looks like it may be a better bet.

Food delivery company DoorDash will be going public this week. Many investors are ready to participate in this blockbuster initial public offering (IPO). On the following day, it would be Airbnb’s turn to go public. The company plans to price its initial public offering at $90 to $95 per share, which gives it a valuation of up to $37 billion on a fully diluted basis. That’s nearly triple the market value of Lyft (LYFT Stock Report) and roughly the same as Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG Stock Report). The company will be trading on Nasdaq under the ticker “DASH”. Understandably, many on Wall Street have been anticipating DoorDash’s IPO.
