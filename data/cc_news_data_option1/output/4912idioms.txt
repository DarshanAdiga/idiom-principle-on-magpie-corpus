It's not as if Matt Ryan lit up the scoreboard, going 22 of 39 for 185 yards and a pair of 4-yard touchdown passes to Calvin Ridley (on fourth-and-goal at the 3) and Brandon Powell. Johnathan Abram had an interception which the offense failed to convert into a touchdown. Trayvon Mullen had a nice end zone breakup. Atlanta's 4.5 yards per pass attempt was actually a fraction below the Raiders' 4.6. Ryan was sacked just one time but never appeared completely comfortable in the pocket. There's a reason the Falcons had to kick five field goals. Isaiah Johnson had a costly pass interference penalty for 25 yards.

In one sequence, Cole punted the Falcons deep into their own territory, the defense held, and then Derek Carrier got a hand on an Atlanta punt that traveled just 20 yards. The offense did nothing with the field position. There were no big plays in the return game on either side. Daniel Carlson connected on two short field goals to account for the Raiders' only scoring.

 International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global airline trade group representing 290 carriers in 120 countries came out with a report demonstrating the low incidence of inflight COVID-19 transmission. “Risk of a passenger contracting COVID-19 while onboard appears very low. With only 44 identified potential cases of flight-related transmission among 1.2 billion travellers, that’s one case for every 27 million travellers. Even if 90% of cases were unreported, it would be one case for every 2.7 million travellers. The vast majority of published cases occurred before the wearing of face coverings in flight became widespread,” claimed its medical advisor Dr. David Powell.
 Top five destinations during post-covid continue to be Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. The city offers direct connections to Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and even the North East. Top three airlines also have no major change — IndiGo, SpiceJet and Air India. An onsite coronavirus testing laboratory run by Mapmygenome, an ICMR and NABL certified lab, is functional round the clock at the immigration level or Interim International Departures Terminal for passengers and airport personnel benefit.
 “E-boarding services to international flights had also become functional. With steady increase in traffic in line with the city’s economic resurgence, we are hopeful of reaching the pre-Covid level in terms of operations,” the spokesman added.

With the help of a microchip under the dog's skin, Campbell was able to identify Shade as the owner. Shade says it offers a lesson that there “are kind-hearted people willing to go above and beyond."

Regardless of how Iran decides to retaliate between now and inauguration day, none of its short-term options are risk-free. And if such incidents continue to occur in the 50 remaining days of the Trump presidency, they could drag Iran down a path it would prefer not to take. In the medium term, Tehran may become less inclined to negotiate meaningful limits to other areas of concern—including its missile program and support for proxies—which Biden promised on the campaign trail his administration would seek to curtail. In the long term, Iranian leaders may come to the conclusion that their country needs a nuclear weapon to deter adversaries from undertaking such actions in the future regardless of the costs associated with it.

He finished with 27 yards on seven attempts (the Raiders had to abandon the run when the score got out of hand) and 16 of those yards came on a single play. The Raiders gained 40 yards on 14 attempts and just one lonely rushing first down and it came on a 9-yard Peterman scramble. Atlanta stuffed the Raiders when they tried to go wide and pinched off the middle. The run-blocking was as problematic as the pass blocking from a unit that had been beyond reproach most of the season.

Democrats have been quick to dismiss any Trump supporter as a racist, homophobe or redneck, but they all shared a common trait with him, an unapologetic love of America.
 The Republican success down-ballot and in state legislatures shows the folly of this condescension and sends a clear message that a majority of Americans are not ready for the socialist agenda favored by the radical left. Not only were there more Trump voters in 2020, there were more Hispanic and African- American voters backing Trump. The supreme irony here is that gradually the Republicans are becoming the party of the working class.
 Trump reawakened the base with a populist message disdained by his critics as “Trumpism” but more closely resembling the rise of Huey Long. Trump was adored by his followers, who will remember him kindly.
 Now it is time for Republicans to refocus and concentrate on winning the two races in Georgia. I am sure President Trump will do the right thing when the time comes.
