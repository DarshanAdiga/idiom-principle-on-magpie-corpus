 Biden eats into Trump's lead in Pennsylvania, which is now at 18k votes
 As news hit early Friday that former Vice President Joe Biden has edged ahead of President Donald Trump in the ongoing fight for Georgia's 16 electoral votes, Trump's lead in Pennsylvania, a state he must win, is dwindling.
 The president is on top by about 18,000 votes in the sought-after swing state, with about 3% of mail-in votes still to be counted.
 Without Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes Trump has no path to the presidency.
 Less than 24 hours ago, Trump led in the Keystone State by more than a 100,000 votes. On Wednesday, his lead in Pennsylvania surpassed 600,000.
 Many of the mail-in ballots being counted are from Philadelphia and its suburbs, areas that heavily tilt toward Democrats.
 Trump has so far prevailed in a legal challenge he brought in Pennsylvania that mandates that election observers be allowed to observe the count within six feet of any table or area where the counting is taking place. Poll watchers were initially required to remain at least 25 feet away from these areas, a distance Trump's campaign team objected to.
 Trump has so far failed in a separate legal bid to get the count in Pennsylvania halted altogether.

 Biden takes the lead from Trump in Georgia
 Democratic candidate Joe Biden officially took the lead in Georgia Friday, after a new round of results were released.
 As of 4:30 a.m. EST, the former Vice President leads by 917 votes with thousands of ballots remaining to be counted.
 Biden caught then passed Trump in the traditionally red state due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic-leaning counties. Democratic voters utilized early voting and mail-in ballots across the nation more so than Republicans.
 Georgia is critical to Trump's reelection, but not necessary to Biden's path to the White House.
 The state has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since 1992, when Bill Clinton won the state by 13,000 votes. Trump beat Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Georgia in 2016 by 211,141 votes, or 50.4% to 45.3%.
 Clayton County, which was represented by the late Rep. John Lewis, was one of the counties that put Biden over the top in Georgia.

 Could today be the day?
 No states were called Thursday in the presidential election, but Friday may well be the day the election ends when most of the remaining battleground states hit the home stretch in counting and even call some races.
 Biden begins the day with 264 Electoral College votes to Trump's 214. That means Biden needs to win one of the four remaining battleground states. All of them are expected to make significant progress or finish counting outright.
 One of those critical states is Georgia, where Democratic nominee Joe Biden took the lead Friday morning as voting continues.
 In Pennsylvania, major counties such as Philadelphia have been counting through the night, and the president's lead there is also narrowing.
 Biden gained ground due to an onslaught of mail-in ballots from Democratic- leaning counties.
 Arizona and Nevada finishing up
 Voters can also expect updated results Thursday morning from Arizona, where Trump has been narrowing Biden's lead, and Nevada, where Biden leads by around 11,500 votes.
 An estimated 190,150 ballots remained uncounted in Nevada on Thursday, according to the Reno Gazette Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.
 State elections officials announced nearly two-thirds of that total were either returned by mail or dropped off in-person on Election Day. The remaining 66,596 votes were cast by same-day registrants either in-person on Tuesday or during the state's two-week early voting period.
 Some 90% of the outstanding ballots are in Clark County, a southern Nevada stronghold for Democrats where the party built up a daunting 89,000-voter edge over Republicans in early voting turnout.

The Embraer Phenom 300E is the most successful business jet of the last ten years. As the first jet with single pilot approval, the “Enhanced” version introduced in 2020 is capable of speeds up to Mach 0.8 – that corresponds to 988 km/h. In addition to its impressive speed, the twin-engine aircraft also sets standards in terms of range: up to 2,010 nautical miles (equivalent to 3,723 kilometres) can be covered with corresponding long-range cruise speed, five persons and the prescribed fuel reserve1. Depending on the configuration of the light jet, up to ten passengers can travel in comfort and work in a relaxed atmosphere on board.

We make financial investments continually. However, I see our greatest risks are usually about people. We are only as good as our people and sometimes you must put your name on the line to support someone that you believe in. None of us are perfect, we are continually learning; people are not plug and play. Sometimes you have to go out on a limb for good people and, I think, most often they will pay you back.

The move toward green energy is a generally good thing, but it is not always black and white. For example, if we use more rechargeable equipment, the spent batteries have to be dumped somewhere. The metals and chemicals in our computers, cellphones, and batteries can be toxic to the environment. We protect our local environment by dropping them off at the Howard County Recycling District office, but much of that has to be dumped somewhere – perhaps in Asian nations. We save trees by using plastic bags, but plastics are one of our greatest environmental concerns (especially those pesky plastic water bottles littering our oceans). The trick is to weigh the pros and cons.
 Even with our hesitations, the continued rise of green energy is inevitable. We are developing creative approaches that make it feasible. Let’s start with the power of wind. Windmills could become our most significant source of green energy.
 When proposed windfarms in our area were nixed by community outcries, I understood the concern. People do not want beautiful rural landscapes marred by windmills, noise could be an issue, and the fallout in the bird population is alarming. Although blades with color stripes significantly help reduce bird casualties, the other objections still stand. These objections are not unique to Howard, Tipton, or Miami counties – they have been voiced around the world.
 One solution is to locate windfarms at sea (where winds are strongest), beyond normal visibility from the shore. That’s exactly what they have done off the coast of Scotland. Floating buoyed platforms are kept from drifting away via cables connected to heavy anchors. This floating windfarm has withstood hurricane conditions without significant damage.

Khan continued saying he loved the segment. He said that if he could change anything about it, he would have rather film the segment in the ring and possibly have shot it live.
 "We can't do that, and I can't cannibalize a show like that, but I do love the idea of Chris and Max singing because Chris is a great singer and Max has a background in theater and singing," Khan pointed out. "Both guys have great voices. I'm a huge huge fan of both guys, and I thought that this could be great. And I love the idea of them singing [and] going out for the steak dinner. I think it's tremendous.
 "If I could do something again, in hindsight, and we all agreed on this, I brought this up and everyone thought it was a good point, I would have done it in the ring. I would have rather done in the ring, and it would have been challenging to do it live, but we could have even taped in the ring. And I think it could have come off great, but I think having it between the ropes and in the squared circle would have been the way to go. But hindsight's 20/20. The idea of it was great, [but] we're not going to do it as a dream sequence. But I thought that the idea of Chris and Max singing really appealed to me, and it still does."
 Khan then talked about the town hall segment that set up the Jericho vs. MJF match where if MJF wins, he will join The Inner Circle. The segment saw the return of Eric Bischoff, and Khan noted that it was Jericho's idea to bring Bischoff back. He also spoke on Bischoff's improv during the segment that neither he nor MJF knew about ahead of time.
 "Then the town hall segment, which again, I worked really closely with Chris on, it paid off great, and it was Chris' idea to bring in Eric again," Khan revealed. "And I was like, 'that's a great idea,' and then I wrote a lot of this stuff. And Eric, he's said on his show, Eric came in. He did a little bit of rewriting on the fly, which threw me and Max off a little bit because he told Chris, but he didn't tell us. The timing of it was fine, so I was okay with it, and Max didn't miss a beat.
 "And I'm okay with people improving a little bit, and I thought when Eric did his 'ask not what your company can do for you.' That was not what was originally in there, but the three-prong question and Eric B. from Cody, Wyoming and all that [was]. I didn't see that coming, but I had worked with this with Chris, and I had the idea of well, you want to bring Eric in, we should have Tony announce, 'Eric B. from Wyoming.'"
 Many other wrestlers showed up during the segment to ask questions including Luchasaurus, Britt Baker and Peter Avalon. Avalon asked if he could join The Inner Circle, which caused him to be laughed off. However, Khan revealed that he had considered former WCW World Heavyweight Champion David Arquette in that role.
 "I also had an idea, I wanted to use David Arquette," Khan revealed. "I thought he would have been good too, and David Arquette, actually, was the original person I wanted to use in Peter Avalon's spot of the 'could I join The Inner Circle?' And it would have been a very different reaction. They would have considered it maybe a little more with David Arquette as opposed to Peter Avalon."

Roma, 6 nov. (Adnkronos) - Venchi chiude un negozio a Fiumicino e trasferisce 10 madri con figli minori, anche in zone rosse. A denunciarlo in una nota è l'Usb spiegando che il 3 novembre, durante un incontro per la definizione di una controversia legale sui part-time, la società Venchi ha annunciato "senza troppi giri di parole che discutere di turnazione oraria è del tutto inutile in quanto è già stata predisposta la chiusura di un negozio, dei tre presenti all'aeroporto di Fiumicino, e quindi raggira il divieto di licenziamento trasferendo il personale su territorio nazionale. Nessuna previa comunicazione alle rappresentanze aziendali e una doccia fredda per lavoratrici e lavoratori che non restano in cassa integrazione, come previsto dai decreti emanati, bensì vengono loro consegnate delle lettere di trasferimento per Torino, Parma, Vicenza, Piacenza, Venezia e Siena, nonostante l'azienda conti altri quattro punti vendita su Roma e altri due in aeroporto".
 Per l'Usb il comportamento dell'azienda "è inaccettabile" : Venchi "si 'disfa' di 11 lavoratrici e lavoratori, di cui 10 lavoratrici madri di figli minori. L'azienda avrebbe potuto mantenere la cassa integrazione messa a disposizione dal Governo per affrontare la crisi sanitaria, senza dover affrontare alcun costo, ma preferisce mettere i suoi dipendenti in condizione di dimettersi, trasferendoli a centinaia di chilometri da casa e per di più nelle cosiddette zone rosse, mettendo gravemente a rischio la loro salute".
 Una operazione, rileva Usb, "predisposta volutamente per raggirare il divieto di licenziamento, eliminare il contenzioso legale sulla illegittimità del part-time, disfarsi di lavoratrici 'scomode' perché rivendicavano i loro diritti. Usb ha denunciato questo gravissimo atto di arroganza padronale in tutte le sedi – Enti Locali, Ministero del Lavoro e Ispettorato del Lavoro – chiedendo con forza a tutte le istituzioni un intervento per impedire che in questa fase di crisi si perdano posti di lavoro, soprattutto delle donne più esposte a una condizione di difficoltà. E' inaccettabile che ancora una volta siano i lavoratori e le lavoratrici a pagare la grave crisi di un sistema dedito esclusivamente al profitto che ha evidenziato tutte le sue falle in questo periodo di emergenza pandemica". Martedì l'Usb organizza una manifestazione alle 10 davanti al Comune di Fiumicino per chiedere un intervento a tutela dell'occupazione.
