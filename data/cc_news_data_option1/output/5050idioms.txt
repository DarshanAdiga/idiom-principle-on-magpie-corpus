CHICAGO (AP) — The city of Chicago has cited a restaurant owed by an alderman for allowing customers to dine inside in violation of rules designed to slow the spread of COVID-19, city officials said Tuesday. Ann Sather, a restaurant owned by Alderman Tom Tunney, faces two citations, which carry maximum fines of more than $10,000 combined, according to Chicago’s Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Department. Indoor dining has been shut down in the city since late October. And Tunney has previously acknowledged that allowing diners inside his restaurant in the Wrigleyville neighborhood was an “error in judgment.” “We’ve been sporadically letting some people in, regulars at the restaurant, to accommodate them from time to time,” Tunney said Monday. “It’s done. It will not continue, as of today.” Tunney on Tuesday declined to comment about the citations, beyond acknowledging he received them and has a hearing date early next year. Tunney is the latest politician facing scrutiny for not following social distancing rules. Recently, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was ridiculed for attending a dinner at a restaurant and ignoring mask mandates. Also, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock flew to Houston ahead of Thanksgiving despite his warnings that people should stay close to home and spend the holiday with their own household.

At 9-3, the Packers are on course for potentially hosting multiple playoff games. Entering this week’s games, they were one game behind the New Orleans Saints for the NFC’s No. 1 seed and the first-round playoff bye that comes with it.
 Should the Packers finish with the top seed, they would have that bye week and then host an NFC divisional playoff game on Jan. 16 or 17 and, if they advanced, host the NFC Championship Game on Jan. 24. Super Bowl LV is scheduled for Feb. 7 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Earlier this season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with 15,540 fans in Raymond James Stadium. The Packers lost 38-10.
