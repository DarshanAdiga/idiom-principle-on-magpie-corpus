After being challenged by two individuals for his position in the Pettis County Assessor race, incumbent Christopher Woolery emerged as the winner in Tuesday’s election.
 Woolery, who has been in the position for three years and has worked in the department since 2011, received 3,854 votes, or 59.03% of the vote.
 Woolery said he was doing “great” and was “pretty elated.” He said he was thankful for people keeping their trust in him.
 “It’s very humbling to see so many people have kept their faith in me over the last few years,” he said. “There have been some less than unfavorable things that have had to happen but people have stuck with me through that and I really appreciate it…
 “To the public, thank you very much for supporting me through all of this and I’ll continue to do the best job I can to make everything right for the people of Pettis County,” he added.
 Woolery said his plans for the office are to continue working on cross training in the office and continue working on electronic organization.
 “My goal is to have multiple people doing a lot more of the more difficult tasks that I do so that I’m not the only one who knows it,” Woolery explained. “Even if I’m not in the office anyone can get a hold of me on my cellphone but it’s better to have people who can actually do the hands on stuff as well...I’ve been training in new areas for some people and I’ve got a good group of people that really pick up on things.
 “The closest plan that I’m working on right now is just getting everything organized electronically so I can get more information out to the people,” he added.
 Woolery was challenged by Pettis County Deputy Assessor Amber Bridges who began working in the county’s personal property department before moving to the real estate department. Bridges received 1,691 votes, or 25.9%.
 “I just appreciate all the votes that I did get and congratulations to Chris,” Bridges told the Democrat.
 Woolery was also challenged by Sedalia Ward 1 Councilman Tom Oldham who received 984 votes, or 15.07%.
 “First off I want to thank everybody who voted for me,” Oldham told the Democrat. “I want to thank them for the support, the support of my friends and family who have worked hard to get me to the point where I am. I want to congratulate Chris on his victory of retaining his seat as county assessor…
 “Amber did a fantastic job at running a campaign,” he added. “I was happy to build a friendship with her. I also look forward to working with Chris and with Amber and with the county on any issues in the future as well.”
 Oldham also encouraged Woolery to maintain transparency and communication with the public because those were the issues Oldham encountered the most with the public when campaigning.
 As for the future, Oldham said he will continue his service as a councilman in Sedalia.
 “I’m going to work harder with Downtown Sedalia Alliance and we’re going to make sure that downtown is completely re-innovated…” Oldham said. “We’re going to see a lot of new businesses come to downtown.
 “Also as walking throughout the county for this campaign I definitely see an issue with sidewalks,” he added. “That’s going to be my focus this year with the city as well.”

Two employees at Wendy’s in Sedalia were recognized Tuesday morning for their bravery during a tragic fatal vehicle accident at the restaurant last month.
 Donavan Dobson, 16, and Preston Carr, 22, were honored by Hamra Enterprises, which owns the Sedalia location, during a small ceremony in the back parking lot of the restaurant. Coworkers, local officials, family and friends were present to help celebrate their efforts in the aftermath of the July 13 crash. Dobson and Carr were presented “Selfless Act of Heroism” plaques that feature the Captain America shield, a letter from Wendy’s corporate office, and a $300 Visa gift card.
 Dobson, Carr and Tina Edwards, the manager on duty that night, spoke with the Democrat after the ceremony to recall those intense moments after the crash.
 Edwards said she was in the back of the restaurant but had a view of the dining room.
 “We heard a sound almost like a tornado, just crashes through there and at first you stop for a minute because you’re like, ‘What?’ And then you look up again and I ran out of the office,” Edwards said. “We dialed 911 and then ran out to the dining room to assess what had happened out there.”
 Edwards said she had another manager take all of the employees through the back of the building to the parking lot. She said Dobson was already in the dining room headed for the truck. Carr was helping as well.
 “I heard a big crash, I thought someone had just broken one of the windows. Then I heard my manager Tina scream, so I rushed out to see what was going on and I saw a truck was through the Wendy’s and I smelled gas, so I hurdled over some debris to go shut off the truck,” Dobson recalled. “... I checked (the driver) for injuries, he didn’t have anything serious so I got him out of the truck with another gentleman and set him down on a booth.”
 Dobson then turned his attention to an injured customer who he said was on the ground in shock. At that point, the Sedalia Fire Department arrived on scene and Dobson offered injury reports.
 “I went back to help the gentleman, got him some water, another gentleman helped get the water,” Dobson said. “I saw his kid watching and I didn’t think he should see his dad in pain so I brought him over to the side and started helping with his wounds. … That kid was tough, he didn’t cry once.”
 Carr said he had just been in the dining room cleaning and refilling items. He then heard a noise coming and saw the truck come into the building.
 “When that happened, I went to go check on customers, asked the manager what she needed me to do, how can I help them out with what happened,” Carr said. “... I noticed one of the customers was in a corner screaming, so I went over to try to calm her down and get her out of the building.”
 Sedalia Police officers then took over the scene and Dobson showed firefighters to the restaurant’s breaker box. Dobson said he continued trying to keep everyone calm as officers and firefighters worked the scene.
 “Make sure everyone’s all right, don’t let anything happen worse than it already had,” Dobson said of what was going through his head at the time. “I wasn’t really thinking, to be honest.”
 Even as Edwards joined the rest of her crew outside to check on them, Dobson and Carr chose to stay inside and continue helping customers.
 “I’ve learned from lots of people that you should always help others instead of being stingy and thinking about ourselves, not thinking of others because others are more important than yourself,” Carr said of his decision to help. “I learned that from my parents, my friends, church buddies. I learned that from Tina because when I first started, Tina said it’s possible that bad things could happen here and anything that happens, help others first.
 “You should help others out first before you help yourself.”
 Both Dobson and Carr were humble about their recognition Tuesday morning and offered thanks to SPD and SFD, but Sedalia Fire Chief Greg Harrell, Sedalia Police Chief Matt Wirt, Sedalia Mayor John Kehde and Hamra Enterprises President and CEO Mike Hamra praised the two during remarks at the ceremony. All four said they were impressed by their bravery and heroism in the face of an emergency.
 “Absolutely I’m so proud of those guys,” Edwards said. “... To not even think of themselves and to go help those guys, you couldn’t ask for better kids. All you hear is the bad stuff, and they were willing to take care of other people and not think about what might happen to them when they’re in the building.”
 Edwards also recognized the rest of her crew for their assistance after the crash. She said employees helped turn off appliances, directed drive-thru customers through the parking lot, and checked each other for injuries. She said Dobson and Carr jumped into action, but her other employees were also helping behind the scenes, along with support later that night and the weeks following from Wendy’s and Hamra management.
 According to SPD Cpl. A.J. Silvey, at 5:58 p.m. Monday, July 13 a pickup truck was traveling south on South Limit Avenue when it suddenly veered east and left the roadway in front of the American Inn, 1217 S. Limit Ave. It traveled through some landscaping and then struck the front of the Wendy’s dining room.
 Carol Barnes, 80, was killed and her husband, Donald Barnes, 85, was taken by Life Flight to University Hospital in Columbia. He has since been moved out of critical condition.
 Carr was the one to find Carol Barnes and he moved a table and chairs out of the way to check on her until first responders arrived.
 Eight people were in the front portion of the dining room when the truck crashed into the restaurant. In addition to Donald Barnes, four other people were injured.
 The driver was later identified as 62-year-old Dennis K. Weaver, of Sedalia. He was originally arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated, but no charges were filed. Silvey said the Missouri State Highway Patrol Crash Team is assisting the SPD Traffic Unit with the investigation, which is ongoing.

We've been saying to our subscribers and anyone else who would listen that SPCE will need to do a capital raise soon. This is a capital intensive business with a burn rate (see - VC-backed phraseology!) of c.$60m/qtr and on account of not having revenue, it has a limited number of quarters' runway at any given moment.
 In the last few weeks SPCE has made the classic B-round preparatory moves.
 First up, the company hired a new CEO with a corporate background. Joining from Disney (DIS), Michael Colglazier's pitch is to bring Disney-grade consumer focus and safety to the core SPCE service. Former CEO George Whitesides remains on the bus as Chief Space Officer and has handled the change in exemplary fashion, at least to an outside observer.
 Second, the company walked into the start of the B-round fundraising meeting - for which read Q2 earnings call - with that most celebrated of VC artifacts, the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding. In this case, with Rolls-Royce (OTCPK:RYCEF) to work on hypersonic-capable regular aircraft - Rolls providing the propulsion, SPCE - and presumably their investor Boeing (BA) - the airframe.
 Third, during the B-round meeting / Q2 earnings call, they used the hallowed phrase so desired by SPCE shareholders, being "orbital spaceflight program". In other words, proper space. Not just-about-space-but-below-the-Karman-line. Real space. Then it got better. Working with the NASA Johnson Space Center in TX to deliver commercial service to and from the International Space Station - which NASA and other stakeholders are hoping to commercialize now that it is reaching the end of its planned life as a government laboratory.
 Along the way they slipped in the numbers - no recognized revenue, burn rate not worsening, customer indications of interest growing, very few deposit cancellations resulting from the Covid crisis. No-one looked at the numbers because everyone was still all a-jitter about the orbital spaceflight program.
 And then the coup de grâce, the B round. A public equity raise of c.$500m, depending on the achieved price per newly subscribed share. Invitations went out through key brokers; the time for indications of interest close at the end of the day on 5 August.

Despite some initial controversy, a franchise of fast food chain Chick-fil-A is now open for takeout at 536 Whipple Ave. in Redwood City.
 A long line of cars waiting in the drive-through snaked well out of the parking lot and down the block at the chain's grand opening Thursday, July 23, according to videos posted on social media.
 San Mateo County Supervisor David Canepa had publicly opposed Chick-fil-A's plan to open in Redwood City, writing in a letter to the chain's CEO that "your company's anti-LGBTQ policies do not represent the values of the overwhelming majority of San Mateo County residents."
 Chick-fil-A came under fire in 2012 when Dan Cathy, the founder's son, said that he believes in the "biblical definition of the family unit." Chick-fil-A was also criticized for making donations to charities that oppose same-sex marriage.
 Last November, Chick-fil-A announced it would no longer donate to those charities and would instead give $9 million to support education, homelessness and hunger initiatives. The company said that at every new location it opened, it would make a $25,000 donation to a local food bank. (Chick-fil-A did not immediately respond to an inquiry about which local food bank was supported with the Redwood City opening.)
 In response, Canepa told local TV station KPIX that this "shows that Chick- fil-A has a heart" and that "instead of protesting Chick-fil-A, we want to cut the ribbon with Chick-fil-A because of the actions they've taken."
 Chick-fil-A started offering delivery on the Peninsula out of DoorDash's Redwood City commissary kitchen in November.
 The brick-and-mortar restaurant is open for drive-through or walk-up pickup orders Monday through Saturday. It's closed on Sunday, as are all Chick- fil-A's in keeping with founder Truett Cathy's Christian faith.

Moody action-RPG Mortal Shell is right around the corner, lurking in the shadows and ready to ambush you in only a couple of weeks, on August 18. Keep your eyes peeled. Or direct them towards the new trailer, above, which gives you a taste of tricky battles and miserable setting.
 Cold Symmetry and Playstack hosted a closed beta last month, but apparently the gamers were pounding on the gates and the closed beta became an open one, welcoming more than 350,000 players into the gloomy realm. It also got more than 5 million views on Twitch, and the cat was stroked more than 150,000 times. No word on how many deaths there were, but probably a few.
 James was one of those who went off to die, calling it a denser, more challenging take on Souls-like games, and one that features both the best and worst parts of the growing subgenre.
 "I'd kill for a checkpoint system, maybe weaker enemies," he said, "not because I didn't like the initial challenge, but because I didn't find the areas challenging or fun or my character significantly improved on the umpteenth runthrough. It quickly degraded into repetition without reward."
 None of this is necessarily a deal-breaker, though, and he reckons there's the potential for a fascinating story and world building. Also intriguing is the shell system. The shells are all characters with pasts that are unfurled as you upgrade them and read item descriptions--they're more than just class archetypes. Take a gander at his detailed Mortal Shell hands-on for more.

Dans le cadre de la lutte contre les différentes formes de criminalité, notamment la vente de «faux» billets de 2.000 DA sur les réseaux sociaux, les éléments de la Police judiciaire ont remarqué un individu proposant sur une page Facebook, utilisée sous un pseudonyme, la vente de faux billets en monnaie nationale. Suite à cette découverte, un plan bien ficelé a été mis en place ayant permis l’arrestation du concerné et de trois (3) autres individus et la saisie du téléphone portable du principal suspect, d’un faux billet (catégorie 2.000 Da) présenté comme spécimen, d’une enveloppe contenant des mouchoirs en papier parfumés comme étant des billets de 2.000 DA afin de duper la «victime» à délester de son argent et ses objet. L’opération a donné lieu également à la saisie d’un véhicule touristique utilisé dans les déplacements des suspects, dont la dernière «victime» avait été délestée de 30.000 DA, d’après les aveux de l’un d’eux, ajoute la même source qui précise que le 4e suspect a été arrêté en possession d’un morceau de drogue. Par ailleurs, la Sûreté de la wilaya d’Alger fait état d’une seconde affaire de démantèlement d’une association de malfaiteurs spécialisée dans le transport, l’écoulement et le trafic de stupéfiants et de comprimés psychotropes avec port d’armes blanches de type 6 sans justificatif légal.

 ## "Wait, We Have An MOU With ...."
 Cast your mind back to February this year, you know, before the market decided the world was ending and then decided that Jerome Powell was the New Avenger to save us all, whereupon the market decided that in _fact_ everything was wonderful despite that, er, _pandemic_ thing folks kept going on about. Back then, in those hazy days of innocence, we posted a note on Virgin Galactic (SPCE) Q4 2019 earnings. We said, if you ever hankered to invest like a VC, but aren't a VC, this is your chance. Because SPCE is a pre-revenue business run just like a VC-backed business, except its shares trade on a real life stock exchange. And it has to do tiresome stuff like SEC filings, earnings calls and so forth as a result. You can read that February note here.
